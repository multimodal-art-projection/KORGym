First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's situation. \n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). Let's parse the current board row by row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so positions (1,1) to (1,6) are empty)\nRow 2: #A     # → (2,1) is 'A' (apple)\nRow 3: # A    # → (3,2) is 'A' (apple)\nRow 4: #  H   # → (4,3) is 'H' (snake head)\nRow 5: #      # → (5,1)-(5,6) empty\nRow 6: #   A  # → (6,3) is 'A' (apple)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake starts moving in the direction it's facing. The snake's head is at (4,3) (assuming rows are 0-7, columns 0-7, with (row, column) indexing). Since current direction is UP, the next move would be to (3,3) if we keep moving UP. But we can change direction, as long as it's not the reverse. The reverse of UP is DOWN, so we can't go DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWe need to choose a direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) but DOWN is the reverse of current direction (UP), so it's invalid. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Current direction is UP. If we keep moving UP, the next head position is (4-1,3) = (3,3). Let's check what's at (3,3). Looking at row 3: \"# A    #\", which is columns 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is 'A', 3 is ' ', 4-6 are ' '. So (3,3) is empty. So moving UP would take the head to (3,3). Since there's no apple there, the snake doesn't grow. The body would be added where the head was, but since the snake's length is 1 (only head), after moving, the previous head position (4,3) becomes body 'S', and the new head is (3,3). The board would update accordingly. But no apple eaten, score remains 0.\n\n2. Direction LEFT: Moving LEFT would change direction to LEFT (since current direction is UP, which is allowed; LEFT is not the reverse). The head's new position is (4,3-1) = (4,2). Check row 4: \"#  H   #\", which is (4,2) is ' ' (since H is at (4,3)), so (4,2) is empty. So moving LEFT here would take the head to (4,2). No apple there, so snake moves, body added at (4,3), new head at (4,2). Score stays 0.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT: Moving RIGHT. New head position is (4,3+1) = (4,4). Check row 4: \"#  H   #\", (4,4) is ' ' (since H is at 3,4 is the next column). So (4,4) is empty. So moving RIGHT would take head to (4,4). No apple, score remains 0.\n\n4. Direction DOWN: Reverse of current direction (UP), which is not allowed. So invalid.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in checking the positions. Let's recheck the apples. Let's list all apple positions:\n\nRow 2, column 1 → (2,1) is 'A'.\nRow 3, column 2 → (3,2) is 'A'.\nRow 6, column 3 → (6,3) is 'A'.\n\nCurrent head is at (4,3). Let's see where the apples are. Let's check possible moves towards apples.\n\nIf we move UP, the next position is (3,3). Let's check (3,3) again. The row 3 is \"# A    #\". Let's index columns 0-7. So row 3:\n\nColumn 0: '#'\nColumn 1: ' ' (since it's \"# A    #\", the first ' ' is column 1, then column 2 is 'A', then column 3 is ' ' (after the A), columns 4-6 are ' '. So (3,3) is ' ', correct.\n\nIf we move UP again next time, then (2,3). Let's see row 2: \"#A     #\". Columns 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4-6: ' '. So (2,3) is ' ', not an apple. The apple in row 2 is at (2,1).\n\nIf we move LEFT, head goes to (4,2). What's (4,2)? The row 4 is \"#  H   #\". Column 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (4,2) is ' ', correct. So no apple there.\n\nIf we move RIGHT, (4,4) is ' ', as row 4's H is at (4,3), so (4,4) is ' '.\n\nWhat about other directions. Let's think about the snake's possible path to reach apples. The apples are at (2,1), (3,2), (6,3). Let's see the positions:\n\nCurrent head (4,3). The apple at (3,2) is one step left and up from the head. Let's see: (3,2) is (4-1, 3-1). So if the snake first moves LEFT (to (4,2)), then next move UP (since direction can't reverse, from LEFT, next can't be RIGHT, but can be UP, DOWN, LEFT). If it moves LEFT to (4,2), then next direction could be UP. Then (4,2) → (3,2), which is the apple at (3,2). That would be good. So moving LEFT now would set up for getting that apple next step.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves UP now to (3,3), then next move could be LEFT to (3,2), which is the apple. Because (3,2) is the apple. Let's check:\n\nCurrent direction is UP. If we move UP to (3,3). Then the new direction could be LEFT (since current direction is UP, next direction can be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (can't be DOWN). So from (3,3), moving LEFT would take to (3,2), which is the apple. That's better. Because moving UP now, then LEFT next epoch would get the apple. So let's see:\n\nEpoch 1: current direction is UP. We choose to keep direction UP. Move to (3,3). Then in epoch 2, direction can be LEFT (allowed). Then move to (3,2), which is the apple. So that's a way to get the apple in two steps.\n\nAlternatively, if we move LEFT now (epoch 1), then in epoch 2, direction could be UP (since current direction would be LEFT, so can't reverse to RIGHT). So from (4,2), moving UP to (3,2) (the apple) in epoch 2. That's also two steps. Either way, we can reach the apple in two steps.\n\nBut what's the current epoch? Epoch 1. The game ends after epoch 100, so we have time. So which direction is better now?\n\nBut let's check if moving UP now is possible. Let's make sure that (3,3) is not a wall or body. Since the snake's length is 1, no body. (3,3) is empty, so moving UP is safe. So that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT is also safe, as (4,2) is empty.\n\nWhat about the other apples? The apple at (2,1) is in row 2, column 1. The head is at (4,3). To get there, the snake would have to move up twice and left twice. Maybe that's a longer path. The apple at (6,3) is in row 6, column 3. That's below the current head (row 4). Since current direction is UP, moving down is not allowed now, but perhaps later. But moving down would reverse direction, which is invalid. So to get to (6,3), the snake would need to move down, but that's not allowed now. So the closest apples are (3,2) and (2,1) and (6,3). The (3,2) is the closest.\n\nSo the best approach is to move towards (3,2). Let's see:\n\nIf current direction is UP, and we move UP to (3,3). Then next direction can be LEFT, moving to (3,2) (apple). That would be epoch 2. So in epoch 2, moving LEFT from (3,3) to (3,2) (apple), which would give a score.\n\nAlternatively, if we move LEFT now (epoch 1) to (4,2), then in epoch 2, move UP to (3,2) (apple). Either path works.\n\nBut which direction is better now? Let's check the possible moves again. Let's confirm the positions.\n\nCurrent head at (4,3). Let's list coordinates as (row, column), with row 0 at top.\n\nIf we move UP (current direction), the new head is (3,3). Check row 3, column 3: yes, it's empty. So that's safe.\n\nIf we move LEFT, new head is (4,2). Check row 4, column 2: empty, safe.\n\nIf we move RIGHT, new head is (4,4). Check row 4, column 4: empty, safe.\n\nIf we move DOWN: reverse direction, invalid.\n\nSo all possible directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe. Now, which direction leads us towards an apple.\n\nThe apple at (3,2) is (row 3, column 2). The current head is (4,3). The apple is one row up (row 3) and one column left (column 2) from the head.\n\nIf we move UP first (to (3,3)), then the next move LEFT (to (3,2)) would reach the apple.\n\nIf we move LEFT first (to (4,2)), then the next move UP (to (3,2)) would reach the apple.\n\nEither way, two moves. So either direction (UP or LEFT) is a good choice.\n\nWhat about moving RIGHT? That would take the head to (4,4). Then, perhaps moving towards (6,3) apple, but that's down. But current direction would be RIGHT, so next direction could be DOWN (since RIGHT's reverse is LEFT, so DOWN is allowed). But (4,4) → (5,4) → (6,4), which is not the apple. The apple is at (6,3), so that's a longer path. So moving RIGHT is not as good.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT. Let's check if there are any obstacles. Since the snake has length 1, no body, so no self-collision. Walls are only at the edges, so all inner positions are safe.\n\nSo either UP or LEFT is acceptable. But which is better? Let's think about the next steps. Let's say we choose UP. Then in epoch 2, the direction can be LEFT, which would take us to the apple. Let's confirm:\n\nEpoch 1: move UP → head at (3,3). Body at (4,3) (now 'S').\n\nEpoch 2: direction LEFT (allowed, since current direction after epoch 1 is UP, so can turn LEFT). Move to (3,2), which is the apple. Then the snake eats the apple, grows, score increases by 1. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose LEFT in epoch 1:\n\nEpoch 1: move LEFT → head at (4,2). Body at (4,3) (now 'S').\n\nEpoch 2: direction UP (allowed, since current direction after epoch 1 is LEFT, so can turn UP). Move to (3,2), which is the apple. Then eat apple, score +1.\n\nEither way, same result. So which direction to choose? Since the question is to pick one of the directions, perhaps either is correct. But maybe there's a better option. Let's see if moving UP now is better because the current direction is UP, so no need to change direction, which might be more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving UP is better because it's the current direction, and the snake is already moving that way. But according to the rules, the player can input any direction except the reverse. So either is allowed.\n\nIn the example given, when the direction was DOWN, the snake moved and ate an apple. So the key is to find the direction that leads to an apple as soon as possible.\n\nIn this case, moving UP now, then LEFT next step, or moving LEFT now then UP next step. Both lead to the apple in epoch 2. So either direction is acceptable. But perhaps the best answer is UP, since it's the current direction, and moving in the current direction is allowed. So the answer could be UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4, 3) (row 4, column 3) and is currently moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3, 3), which is empty. This keeps the snake moving in its current direction and positions it one step away from the apple at (3, 2) (row 3, column 2). In the next epoch, the snake could turn LEFT to reach the apple.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (4, 2), which is empty. This positions the snake one step away from the apple at (3, 2), and in the next epoch, the snake could turn UP to reach the apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4, 4), which is empty but moves the snake away from the nearest apples (at (3, 2) and (2, 1)), making it less optimal.  \n\nBoth UP and LEFT are valid and lead to the nearest apple in the next epoch. Since the snake is already moving UP, continuing in the current direction (UP) is a straightforward choice. \n\nAnswer: UP",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. Let's start by understanding the current game state.\n\nFirst, the game board. Let's parse it row by row. The board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around the edges. The current board is:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #      # (so positions 1,1 to 1,6 are empty)\nRow 2: #      # (same, 2,1-2,6 empty)\nRow 3: # AA   #. So in row 3, columns 2 and 3 are 'A's. Because the first and last are '#' (columns 0 and 7), so positions (3,2) = A, (3,3) = A.\nRow 4: #  H   #. The head is here. Let's check columns. The row is #  H   #, so between the #s. So positions 4,2 is H (since # is 0 and 7, then 1 is space, 2 is H, 3-5 are spaces, 6 is space). So H is at (4,2).\nRow 5: #   A  #. So row 5, columns 3 is A. Because # is 0 and 7. So (5,3) = A.\nRow 6: #      # (empty)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake starts moving in UP direction. The snake's length is 1 (just the head), so no body parts yet. The snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN (because that's reversing). So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because the current direction is UP, the opposite is DOWN, which is not allowed.\n\nNow, the snake moves one square in the direction chosen. Let's see where the head is now. H is at (4,2) (row 4, column 2). If the snake moves UP, that's row 3, column 2. Let's check that position. Row 3, column 2 is 'A' (from row 3: # AA   #, so (3,2) is A). So moving UP would take the head to (3,2), which is an apple. Then, the snake eats the apple, grows in length, score increases by 1. The new head is (3,2), and since the snake was length 1, the body would be the previous head position (4,2) as 'S'. So the next board would have H at (3,2), S at (4,2), and the apple at (3,2) is removed. Then, a new apple is placed? Wait, the problem says \"the game starts with 3 apples\". When the snake eats an apple, does a new one spawn? The example given in the problem shows that after eating an apple, the next state has two As. The initial example had three As (the first example's board has A in (1,5), (3,0?) Wait, maybe the example is different. Let's check the example given:\n\nIn the example, the initial board is:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSo apples are at (1,5), (4,2), (4,3). Then when direction is DOWN, the head (which was at (3,2)) moves down to (4,2), which is an A. Then the next state has H at (4,2), S at (3,2), and the apples are (1,5), (4,3) (since one A was eaten). So the example shows that when an apple is eaten, it's removed, and perhaps a new one isn't added immediately (since initial apples are 3, and after eating one, 2 left). So in our current problem, the current apples are:\n\nLooking at the current board:\n\nRow 3: # AA   # → (3,2) and (3,3) are A.\n\nRow 4: #  H   # → H is at (4,2).\n\nRow 5: #   A  # → (5,3) is A.\n\nSo total apples: 3 (positions (3,2), (3,3), (5,3)). So current apples are 3.\n\nSo if the snake moves UP (current direction is UP), the next position is (3,2) which is an A. So that's good. The snake would eat it, grow, and the score increases.\n\nWhat if the snake turns LEFT? Current head is (4,2). LEFT would be column 1 (since column 2 is current, moving left is column 1). So new position (4,1). Check if that's a wall or body. The row 4 is #  H   #. So (4,1) is a space (since it's between # and H). So (4,1) is empty. So moving left is possible. But no apple there.\n\nIf the snake turns RIGHT: current head (4,2), moving right is column 3. So (4,3). Let's check row 4: #  H   #. So (4,3) is a space. So (4,3) is empty. No apple there.\n\nWhat if the snake continues UP (current direction is UP, so moving UP is allowed). The head is at (4,2). UP direction: row decreases by 1. So (3,2) which is A. That's an apple. So that's the best move, because it allows the snake to eat an apple and grow.\n\nOther directions: Let's check if moving UP is possible. The next position (3,2) is within the board (rows 0-7, columns 0-7). The walls are on the edges (row 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7). So (3,2) is row 3, column 2. Row 3 is not a wall (row 0 is all #). So (3,2) is inside the board. No collision with body (since the snake is length 1, no body). So moving UP is safe and will eat an apple. That's the best option.\n\nSo the direction to choose is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AA   #\n#  H   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP, and it cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is not allowed). The snake's head is at position (4, 2) (row 4, column 2). \n\nAnalyzing possible moves:\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (4, 2) leads to (3, 2), which is an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or self) and will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow, and increase the score.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (4, 2) leads to (4, 1), which is empty. No apple is present here.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (4, 2) leads to (4, 3), which is empty. No apple is present here.\n- **DOWN**: Reversing direction (current direction is UP) is not allowed.\n\nThe best move is to continue moving UP to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: UP",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, let's look at the current game board. The board is 8x8 with walls around. The snake's head is 'H', and since the current length is 1 (starts with length 1), there's no 'S' (body) yet. The current direction is UP, and the epoch is 1, so we're early in the game.\n\nLet me parse the game board line by line. The first line is all walls: ########. The second line is #      #, so empty. Third line same: #      #. Fourth line is #   A  #, so there's an apple at position (3,4) if we consider rows starting from 0. Wait, let's index rows from top to bottom. So row 0 is the top wall. Then row 1 is the first inner row. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (walls)\nRow 1: #      # (columns 1-6 are empty)\nRow 2: #      # (same)\nRow 3: #   A  # → columns 1-6. Let's see, positions: column 1 is #, column 2 is ' ', column 3 is ' ', column 4 is 'A', column 5 is ' ', column 6 is ' ', column 7 is #. So (row 3, column 4) is an apple.\nRow 4: #AAH   # → columns 1: #, column 2: A, column 3: A, column 4: H, column 5: ' ', column 6: ' ', column 7: #. So H is at (row 4, column 4). Because row 4 is the fifth line (since row 0 is first). Let's confirm: row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom. So H's position is (row 4, column 4).\n\nCurrent direction is UP. So the snake is moving up. When it moves, the head will go to the cell above. Let's check where that is. If the head is at (4,4), moving UP (row decreases by 1), the new head position would be (3,4). Let's check that cell. Looking at row 3, column 4: that's 'A' (from row 3: #   A  #, column 4 is A). So if the snake moves UP, the head will hit the apple at (3,4). \n\nWhat happens when it eats the apple? The snake grows in length. Since the initial length is 1, after eating, the length becomes 2. The head moves to (3,4), and the previous head position (4,4) becomes part of the body (so 'S'). Also, the apple at (3,4) is consumed, and a new apple might be placed, but the example given earlier shows that when an apple is eaten, the next state shows the new positions. Wait, in the example, when moving down and eating an apple, the new head is where the apple was, and the previous head becomes 'S'. Let's confirm the example:\n\nOriginal example board had H in row 3, then direction DOWN. So moving down (row increases by 1). The new head is in row 4, which had an A. So after moving, the head is there (H), and the previous position (row 3) becomes S. The apples that were not eaten remain. So in the example, after moving down, the new board has the head in row 4 (where the A was), the previous H position (row 3) is S, and the other apples are still there.\n\nIn our current scenario, moving UP (current direction) would take the head from (4,4) to (3,4), which is an A. So eating that apple. The snake's length increases by 1 (from 1 to 2). The previous head position (4,4) becomes part of the body (so 'S'). The apple at (3,4) is removed, but according to the problem statement, the game starts with 3 apples. Let's check how many apples are current. The current board has:\n\nRow 3: 1 A (column 4)\nRow 4: 2 A's (columns 2 and 3). So total 3 apples. Correct. So if we move UP, the head moves to (3,4), which is A. So that apple is eaten. The new head is (3,4), the old head (4,4) becomes S. The other apples (row 4, columns 2 and 3) remain. The new board would have H at (3,4), S at (4,4), and the two A's in row 4, columns 2 and 3.\n\nNow, the question is, what direction should we choose. The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. But the snake cannot reverse direction. The current direction is UP, so the snake can't reverse to DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because reversing would be to go in the opposite direction. For example, if moving UP, you can't go DOWN. If moving LEFT, can't go RIGHT, etc.\n\nSo the current direction is UP, so the next direction can be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Because DOWN is the opposite and not allowed.\n\nNow, what's the best move here. Let's think about possible collisions. If the snake moves UP, the next position is (3,4), which is an apple. That's good, increases the score. If we choose to move LEFT, what happens? Let's see. The current head is at (4,4). If direction is LEFT, the head would move to (4,3). What's at (4,3)? Looking at row 4: #AAH   #. So columns 1 is #, column 2 is A, column 3 is A, column 4 is H. So (4,3) is A. Oh, right! So (4,3) is an apple. So moving LEFT would take the head to (4,3), which is A. Then the snake eats that apple, grows. The previous head (4,4) becomes S. So that's also a good move.\n\nWait, row 4 is \"#AAH   #\". Let's break down row 4's columns (0-based):\n\nColumn 0: '#'\nColumn 1: ' '? Wait, no. Wait, the row is \"#AAH   #\". Let's count the characters. The row has 8 characters. Let's index columns 0-7.\n\nRow 4: characters are:\n\n0: '#'\n1: 'A' (since \"#AAH...\" → after #, the next is A, then A, then H)\nWait, let's list each position:\n\nRow 4: index 0 is '#', index 1 is 'A', index 2 is 'A', index 3 is 'H', index 4 is ' ', index 5 is ' ', index 6 is ' ', index 7 is '#'. Oh wait, I made a mistake earlier. Because the row is \"#AAH   #\". Let's count the characters:\n\n- Position 0: '#'\n- Position 1: 'A'\n- Position 2: 'A'\n- Position 3: 'H'\n- Position 4: ' '\n- Position 5: ' '\n- Position 6: ' '\n- Position 7: '#'\n\nOh! So the head (H) is at (row 4, column 3). That's a crucial mistake. Let's recheck.\n\nOriginal game board:\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: #      #\nRow 2: #      #\nRow 3: #   A  # → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: # → so (row 3, column 4) is A.\nRow 4: #AAH   # → Let's split this: characters are [ '#', 'A', 'A', 'H', ' ', ' ', ' ', '#' ] → columns 0: #, 1: A, 2: A, 3: H, 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So H is at (row 4, column 3). Oh, that's my mistake earlier. So the head's position is (4,3). \n\nCurrent direction is UP. So moving UP from (4,3) would take the head to (3,3). Let's check row 3, column 3. Row 3 is \"#   A  #\". Columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (3,3) is ' ' (empty). So if the snake moves UP, the head goes to (3,3), which is empty. Since the snake's length is 1, there's no body, so no collision. The move is safe. But there's no apple there, so no score increase.\n\nIf the direction is LEFT, moving LEFT from (4,3) would take the head to (4,2). What's (4,2)? Looking at row 4: column 2 is 'A' (since row 4 is #AAH... → columns 1: A, 2: A, 3: H). So (4,2) is A. So moving LEFT would make the head move to (4,2), which is an apple. So the snake eats the apple, score increases by 1, and the length becomes 2. The previous head position (4,3) becomes 'S' (body). That's a good move.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: moving RIGHT from (4,3) would take the head to (4,4). (4,4) is ' ' (from row 4: columns 4 is ' '). So that's empty, no apple. Safe, but no score.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: current direction is UP, so DOWN is reverse. Not allowed. So direction can't be DOWN.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nNow, which direction gives us the apple. Let's recheck:\n\nCurrent head at (4,3).\n\n- UP: (3,3) → empty. No apple.\n- LEFT: (4,2) → A. Apple here. So eating it.\n- RIGHT: (4,4) → empty. No apple.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT, which allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, increasing the score. That's better than moving UP (no apple) or RIGHT (no apple). \n\nSo the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#AAH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 4, column 3) on the board. The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (4,3) leads to (3,3), which is an empty cell (no apple). This does not increase the score.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (4,3) leads to (4,2), which contains an apple (A). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake's length.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (4,3) leads to (4,4), which is an empty cell (no apple). This does not increase the score.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move LEFT to eat the apple and increase the score. \n\nAnswer: LEFT",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, let's look at the current game board and the current direction. The current direction is UP, and the epoch is 1, so the game is just starting. \n\nFirst, I should repeat the current game board as instructed. Let me check the given board:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nYes, that's correct. The snake's head is at position (4,3) if we count rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7). Because the first row is row 0: ######## (row 0), then row 1 is # A    #, row 2 is #A     #, row 3 is #      #, row 4 is #  H   #, row 5 is #     A#, row 6 is #      #, row 7 is ########. So the head 'H' is in row 4, column 3 (since columns are 0-7, with # being at 0 and 7). \n\nCurrent direction is UP. So the snake is moving up. The snake can't reverse direction, so if current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, the movement rules: the player provides direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is UP, the next direction can be UP (continue), LEFT, or RIGHT. Because reversing would be DOWN, which is not allowed.\n\nNow, the snake's next move is determined by the direction we choose. Let's think about where the head would move next based on each possible direction.\n\nCurrent head position: row 4, column 3 (assuming rows 0-7, columns 0-7).\n\nIf direction is UP: the next head position would be row 3, column 3. Let's check what's there. Row 3 is \"#      #\", so column 3 is empty (since row 3 is all spaces except the # at 0 and 7). So moving UP would take the head to (3,3), which is empty. The snake's body is currently length 1, so after moving, the old head position (4,3) becomes part of the body (since the snake moves, the head moves to new position, and the previous head becomes body if the length is more than 1. Wait, initial length is 1. When the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the length remains 1. So when moving, the head moves, and the previous position is no longer part of the snake (since length 1). Wait, in the example given: the initial snake is length 1 (H). When it moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the snake's body is only the new head, right? Because length 1. Let me think about the example given.\n\nIn the example, the initial board has H in row 3 (assuming rows 0-7). Then direction is DOWN, so the head moves to row 4. Since the example says that after moving, the new board has H in row 4, and the previous position (row 3) becomes S. Oh, because in that example, the snake ate an apple. So when the snake eats an apple, it grows. So, when the snake doesn't eat an apple, the snake's length remains 1. So the head moves, and the previous head position is no longer part of the snake. Because length 1: the snake is just the head. So movement without eating: new head, old head is empty. Movement with eating: new head (H), old head becomes S (body), and length increases by 1.\n\nSo, current snake length is 1. So when moving, if the next position is not an apple, the snake's head moves there, and the previous position is no longer part of the snake (so becomes empty). If the next position is an apple, the head moves there (H), previous position becomes S (body), length increases by 1.\n\nNow, let's check possible directions:\n\nCurrent direction: UP. Possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't go DOWN).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Direction UP:\n\nNext head position: row 4-1=3, column 3. Let's check row 3: \"#      #\". So (3,3) is a space. So moving there: no apple. So snake's head moves to (3,3), previous head (4,3) becomes empty. No collision, no apple eaten. So safe, but no score.\n\n2. Direction LEFT:\n\nNext head position: row 4, column 3-1=2. Check row 4: \"#  H   #\". So current H is at (4,3). Moving left would take it to (4,2). What's in (4,2)? Let's see row 4: the characters are #, space, space, H, space, space, space, #. So (4,2) is a space. So moving left: head moves to (4,2), which is empty. No apple. Safe.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT:\n\nNext head position: row 4, column 3+1=4. Check row 4: \"#  H   #\". (4,4) is a space. So moving right: head to (4,4). Empty. Safe.\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's see where the apples are. The current board has 'A's in:\n\nRow 1 (second line): \"# A    #\" → column 2 (since index 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is A, then spaces). So (1,2).\n\nRow 2: \"#A     #\" → column 1 (index 0 is #, 1 is A, rest spaces). So (2,1).\n\nRow 5: \"#     A#\" → column 5 (index 0 is #, 1-4 spaces, 5 is A, 6 is space, 7 is #). So (5,5).\n\nSo apples at (1,2), (2,1), (5,5).\n\nWe need to find a direction that leads the snake towards an apple, avoiding walls and self-collision (but since the snake is length 1, self-collision isn't possible yet).\n\nCurrent head is at (4,3). Let's think about the path to the apples.\n\nThe snake is moving UP. Let's see where each direction leads.\n\nIf we choose UP, next position (3,3). Then, the next move's direction can be UP (to (2,3)), LEFT (to (3,2)), or RIGHT (to (3,4)). Let's see (2,3) is in row 2, which is \"#A     #\". Row 2's columns: 0 is #, 1 is A, 2-6 are spaces, 7 is #. So (2,3) is a space. So moving UP again would take to (2,3), which is empty. Then maybe towards (2,1) (the A in row 2, column 1). So to reach (2,1), from (2,3), the snake would need to move left twice (to (2,2), then (2,1)), which is possible. But that's two steps. Alternatively, if we go LEFT now (direction LEFT), then the head is at (4,2). Then next possible directions (since current direction would be LEFT, can't go RIGHT). So next direction could be UP, DOWN (no, can't reverse LEFT to RIGHT, but direction after LEFT can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT). Wait, the direction reversal rule: the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nIf we move LEFT now (current direction is UP, so direction LEFT is allowed), head moves to (4,2). Then next possible directions are LEFT (so next move would be (4,1)), UP (to (3,2)), or DOWN (to (5,2)). Let's see (4,1) in row 4: \"#  H   #\", (4,1) is a space. (3,2) is row 3, column 2: space. (5,2) is row 5, column 2: space (row 5 is \"#     A#\", so columns 0 is #, 1-4 are spaces, 5 is A).\n\nIf we go LEFT now, then next move could be LEFT again to (4,1). Then (4,1) is in row 4, which is a space. Then next direction (LEFT again) would take to (4,0), which is a wall (since column 0 is #). So that's bad. So maybe not.\n\nIf we go RIGHT now: direction RIGHT, head moves to (4,4). Then next possible directions (since current direction would be RIGHT, can't go LEFT). So directions could be RIGHT (to (4,5)), UP (to (3,4)), or DOWN (to (5,4)). (4,5) is space. (3,4) is space. (5,4) is row 5, column 4: space (row 5 has A at column 5). So (5,4) is space. Then, moving RIGHT again to (4,5), then (4,6) (space), (4,7) which is a wall. So that's not good.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the apple at (5,5). The head is at (4,3). To reach (5,5), the snake would need to move down (but current direction is UP, can't reverse to DOWN yet). So maybe first move RIGHT, then DOWN (if possible). Let's see:\n\nCurrent direction is UP. If we choose direction RIGHT, then the snake moves to (4,4). Now the current direction is RIGHT. Then next move can be RIGHT, UP, or DOWN (can't go LEFT). If next direction is DOWN, then the snake moves to (5,4). Then current direction is DOWN. Next move can be DOWN (to 6,4), LEFT (can't, since current direction is DOWN, reversing would be UP, but LEFT is allowed?), wait, no: the reversal is only 180 degrees. So direction DOWN can't reverse to UP, but can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. So from (5,4), direction RIGHT would take to (5,5), which is the apple at (5,5). So that's a possible path: RIGHT → DOWN → RIGHT. That would reach the apple in 3 steps. But epoch is 1, so first move is epoch 1. Then next moves would be epoch 2, 3, etc. But since the game ends after 100 epochs, that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,1) (row 2, column 1). The head is at (4,3). To reach (2,1), the snake could move UP (to 3,3), then UP again (to 2,3), then LEFT (to 2,2), then LEFT (to 2,1). That's 4 steps. So that's longer.\n\nThe apple at (1,2) (row 1, column 2). To reach there: head at (4,3) → UP to (3,3) → UP to (2,3) → UP to (1,3) → LEFT to (1,2). That's 4 steps.\n\nSo the closest apple is (5,5) which is in row 5, column 5, which is two steps down and right from the current position (4,3) → (5,4) → (5,5). But to get there, the snake needs to first change direction to RIGHT, then DOWN, then RIGHT. Let's see:\n\nCurrent direction is UP. First move: direction RIGHT (allowed, since not reversing). So head moves to (4,4) (epoch 1). Now direction is RIGHT. Epoch 2: direction DOWN (allowed, since current direction is RIGHT, can't reverse to LEFT, so DOWN is allowed). So head moves to (5,4). Epoch 3: direction RIGHT (allowed, since current direction is DOWN, can't reverse to UP, so RIGHT is allowed). Head moves to (5,5), which is the apple. Then the snake eats the apple, grows, score increases by 1. That's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose direction DOWN now. Wait, current direction is UP, can we choose DOWN? The problem says the snake cannot reverse direction. So current direction is UP, the next direction cannot be DOWN (since that's a reversal). So direction DOWN is invalid. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nSo the best option is to move RIGHT now, to start moving towards the apple at (5,5). Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head (4,3). Direction RIGHT: new head (4,4). That's safe (no wall, no body). Then next steps can proceed towards (5,5). Alternatively, moving UP first would take the snake towards the top apples, but those are further away. So moving RIGHT now is better to reach the closer apple (5,5).\n\n\n########\n# A    #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at row 4, column 3 (0-indexed).\n- Current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- Apples ('A') are located at (1,2), (2,1), and (5,5).\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **UP**: Moves head to (3,3) (empty space). No apple eaten, continues upward but farther from the nearest apple (5,5).\n2. **LEFT**: Moves head to (4,2) (empty space). No apple eaten, moves left but away from the nearest apple (5,5).\n3. **RIGHT**: Moves head to (4,4) (empty space). This positions the snake closer to the apple at (5,5) (row 5, column 5), enabling a future path (RIGHT → DOWN → RIGHT) to reach the apple in subsequent moves.\n\nThe closest apple is at (5,5), and moving RIGHT aligns the snake toward this apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

First, I need to understand the current state of the game. The board is 8x8 with walls as '#'. The snake's head is 'H', and there are apples 'A' around. The current direction is UP, and the epoch is 1, so we're early in the game.\n\nLet me start by visualizing the game board. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #    A # (so positions (1,4) is A, since rows and columns start at 0 maybe? Let's check: columns are 0 to 7. So row 1 has '#' at 0 and 7, then spaces. The 'A' is at column 4, so (1,4).\nRow 2: #      # (all spaces between #s)\nRow 3: #      # (same)\nRow 4: #  H   # (H is at (4,3), since row 4, column 3)\nRow 5: # A    # (A at (5,2))\nRow 6: #     A# (A at (6,5))\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP. The snake's head is at (4,3). Since the snake starts with length 1, there's no body yet. So the next move direction can't be the reverse of UP, which is DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because reversing (to DOWN) is not allowed.\n\nLet's see where the head would go if we choose each possible direction:\n\nCurrent direction is UP. So the snake is moving upwards. The next position if we keep direction UP would be (3,3). Let's check that position. Row 3, column 3. Looking at row 3: \"#      #\", so (3,3) is a space. No collision with walls (since walls are at edges, row 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7). So moving UP to (3,3) is safe. But is there an apple there? No. So the snake would just move, no growth.\n\nIf we choose LEFT: direction is LEFT. The next head position would be (4,2). Let's check (4,2). Row 4 is \"#  H   #\", so the original H is at (4,3). Moving left would take it to (4,2). What's in (4,2)? It's a space. No apple. So safe, but no apple eaten.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: direction is RIGHT. Next position is (4,4). Check row 4: \"#  H   #\". So (4,4) is a space. Safe, no apple.\n\nBut wait, the snake's current direction is UP, so the next move direction can't be DOWN. So the possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check if any of these directions lead to an apple.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\nApple positions are (1,4), (5,2), (6,5).\n\nThe head is at (4,3). Let's see where the apples are relative.\n\nFor UP direction: next position (3,3). No apple there.\n\nFor LEFT: (4,2). Let's check row 5, column 2: (5,2) is an apple. Wait, the head is at (4,3). If we move LEFT, head goes to (4,2). Then, after that move, where is the apple (5,2)? That's below. So no.\n\nIf we move DOWN (but that's not allowed, since current direction is UP; reversing is not allowed. So can't choose DOWN.)\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's recheck the apple positions.\n\nRow 1 (index 1): \"#    A #\", so positions 1: columns 0 is #, 1-3 are spaces, 4 is A, 5-6 are spaces, 7 is #. So (1,4) is A.\n\nRow 5 (index 5): \"# A    #\", so column 1 is #, column 2 is A, then spaces. So (5,2) is A.\n\nRow 6 (index 6): \"#     A#\", column 0 is #, columns 1-4 are spaces, column 5 is A, column 6 is #. So (6,5) is A.\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,3) (row 4, column 3).\n\nLet's see possible next moves:\n\nCurrent direction is UP. So the snake is moving up. The next head position if direction remains UP is (4-1,3) = (3,3). Check if (3,3) is safe. The board's row 3 is \"#      #\", so (3,3) is a space (no wall, no snake body). So safe, no apple.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: the snake turns left. Since current direction is UP, turning left is allowed (not reversing). The movement direction becomes LEFT, so the head moves to (4, 3-1) = (4,2). Check (4,2): row 4 is \"#  H   #\", so original H is at (4,3). (4,2) is a space. Safe, no apple.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: direction becomes RIGHT. Head moves to (4,3+1) = (4,4). Check (4,4): row 4's columns 4 is a space. Safe, no apple.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: that's reversing (current is UP, so DOWN is opposite). Not allowed. So can't choose DOWN.\n\nSo none of the possible directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) will immediately hit an apple. But maybe we need to plan ahead. Let's think about the next steps. The snake is length 1, so no body. So collisions with self are impossible now. The walls are at the edges. So the snake is safe as long as it doesn't hit the walls (rows 0 or 7, columns 0 or 7) or itself (but no body yet).\n\nWhat's the closest apple? Let's calculate distances.\n\nApple at (1,4): distance from (4,3). The Manhattan distance is (4-1) + (4-3) = 3 +1=4.\n\nApple at (5,2): (5-4) + (3-2)=1+1=2.\n\nApple at (6,5): (6-4)+(5-3)=2+2=4.\n\nSo the closest apple is at (5,2), distance 2.\n\nHow can the snake reach (5,2)? The head is at (4,3). The apple is at (5,2), which is down and to the left.\n\nCurrent direction is UP. To reach (5,2), the snake would need to go down (since (5 is row 5, which is below row 4). But the current direction is UP. So the snake can't reverse to DOWN immediately. Let's think:\n\nIf the snake continues moving UP, next position (3,3). Then, in the next move, possible directions would be UP (current direction now is UP), or LEFT, RIGHT (since can't reverse to DOWN). If the snake then turns around, but that's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake turns LEFT now (direction LEFT). Then the head moves to (4,2). Then, the next direction can be LEFT (current direction LEFT), or UP, DOWN (since can't reverse to RIGHT). Then, from (4,2), moving down (direction DOWN) would take it to (5,2), which is the apple. Because (4,2) moving down is (5,2), which is the apple's position. That's a good plan.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nCurrent head at (4,3). Choose direction LEFT. Then head moves to (4,2). Now, the snake's direction is LEFT. Next move, can we choose DOWN? Because current direction is LEFT, the reverse is RIGHT, so allowed directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. So yes, in the next move, direction can be DOWN. Then, from (4,2), moving DOWN to (5,2) (the apple's position). That would eat the apple, increase the score, and the snake grows.\n\nSo choosing LEFT now allows the snake to position itself to reach the closest apple in the next move.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose UP now, the head moves to (3,3). Then, in the next move, the direction could be DOWN (since current direction would be UP, and reversing to DOWN is not allowed. Wait, after moving UP once, the current direction is still UP, right? Because the direction is only changed when the player inputs a new direction, but the movement is in the current direction unless changed. Wait, the problem says: \"The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So each move, the player provides a direction input, which must not be the reverse of the current direction. The snake then moves in the new direction (if valid) or continues in the current direction? Wait, the example shows that when direction is given, the snake moves in that direction. For example, in the example, current direction must have been something, and the player input is DOWN, so the snake moves DOWN.\n\nAh, the problem says: \"The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\"\n\nSo each move, the player chooses a direction (from the four), but it can't be the reverse of the current direction. Then, the snake moves in that direction.\n\nSo in the current state, current direction is UP. So the player can input UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse). The snake will move in the input direction.\n\nSo, the next head position is determined by the direction input.\n\nSo, if the player inputs LEFT, the snake moves LEFT (so from (4,3) to (4,2)).\n\nThen, in the next epoch (epoch 2), the current direction is LEFT, so the player can input LEFT, UP, DOWN (since RIGHT is reverse). So in epoch 2, if the player inputs DOWN, the snake would move DOWN from (4,2) to (5,2), which is the apple's position. That would eat the apple, which is good.\n\nSo, the best move now is to input LEFT, to position the snake to reach the apple in the next move.\n\nLet's check if moving LEFT is safe. (4,2) is in row 4, column 2. The row 4 is \"#  H   #\", so the H is at (4,3). (4,2) is a space. No wall (since column 2 is not 0 or 7), no snake body (since length 1). So safe.\n\nSo the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state. The snake's head ('H') is at position (4,3) (row 4, column 3). The current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (1,4), (5,2), and (6,5). The closest apple is at (5,2) (Manhattan distance of 2 from the head).\n2. **Movement Analysis**:\n   - **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,3), which is empty (no apple, safe but no progress toward the closest apple).\n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,4), which is empty (no apple, safe but no progress toward the closest apple).\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (4,2), which is empty (safe). From (4,2), the next move can be DOWN (allowed, as the new direction would be LEFT, and DOWN is not the reverse of LEFT), leading the head to (5,2) (the closest apple). This positions the snake to eat the apple in the next epoch.\n\n### Conclusion:\nChoosing LEFT allows the snake to position itself to reach the closest apple in the next move. \n\nAnswer: LEFT",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so positions 1,1 to 1,6 are empty)\nRow 2: #     A# (positions 2,5 is 'A')\nRow 3: #  A   # (position 3,3 is 'A')\nRow 4: #  H   # (position 4,3 is 'H' (head of the snake))\nRow 5: #      # (empty)\nRow 6: #     A# (position 6,5 is 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake starts moving in UP direction. The snake's length is 1, so only the head 'H' exists. The snake can't reverse direction, so from UP, the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP (since reversing would be DOWN, which is not allowed).\n\nThe goal is to eat apples. Let's find the positions of the apples. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 2, column 5 (2,5)\n- Row 3, column 3 (3,3)\n- Row 6, column 5 (6,5)\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,3). Let's note that rows are from 0 (top) to 7 (bottom). So moving UP would decrease the row number. Current direction is UP, so the next move (epoch 2) would be in the current direction unless we change it. But the player can input a direction, which must be one of LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, but can't reverse. Since current direction is UP, the snake can't go DOWN (reverse). So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check where each direction would take the head:\n\nCurrent head position is (4,3) (row 4, column 3).\n\n- If direction is UP: next position is (3,3). Let's check what's there. Row 3, column 3 is 'A' (apple). So moving UP would make the snake eat the apple. Then the snake grows, and the score increases by 1. That's good. Also, (3,3) is not a wall (since row 3 is within 1-6, columns 1-6). So no collision. So this is a safe move and gains a point.\n\n- If direction is LEFT: next position is (4,2). What's there? Row 4, column 2. The original row 4 is \"#  H   #\", so columns 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is 'H', 4 is ' ', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So (4,2) is empty. No apple. The snake moves there, but doesn't grow. Then, since the snake's length is 1, the old head (4,3) would no longer be part of the snake. So the new head is (4,2), no body. Safe move but no apple.\n\n- If direction is RIGHT: next position is (4,4). Check row 4, column 4. The row 4 is \"#  H   #\", so column 4 is ' ', so (4,4) is empty. No apple. Same as LEFT, safe but no apple.\n\n- If direction is DOWN: But current direction is UP, so reversing to DOWN is not allowed. So this direction is invalid.\n\nSo the best option is to move UP, which will hit the apple at (3,3). That's the closest apple and a safe move. So the answer should be UP.\n\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n- **Snake Head Position**: (4, 3) (row 4, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Apples**: At (2, 5), (3, 3), and (6, 5).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is invalid as it reverses the current direction).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (4, 3) leads to (3, 3). This position contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake. The new position (3, 3) is within the board (not a wall or snake body), so no collision occurs. This is a safe and beneficial move.\n   \n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (4, 3) leads to (4, 2). This position is empty (no apple). The snake moves here but does not grow. No collision occurs, but no apple is eaten.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (4, 3) leads to (4, 4). This position is empty (no apple). The snake moves here but does not grow. No collision occurs, but no apple is eaten.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is the best choice, as it allows the snake to eat an apple, increase the score, and safely continue without collision.\n\nAnswer: UP",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, let's look at the current game board and the current direction. The current direction is UP, and the epoch is 1, so we're early in the game.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let's parse it row by row. The first and last rows are all '#' (walls). The rows in between (rows 2-7) are the play area. Let's list them:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (empty)\nRow 2: #      # (empty)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #  HAA # (here, the head 'H' is at position (4,3) assuming rows are 0-indexed from top. Let's check: row 4, columns 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is 'H', 4 is 'A', 5 is 'A', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#')\nRow 5: #    A # (row 5: columns 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is ' ', 4 is 'A', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#')\nRow 6: #      # (empty)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at (4,3). The current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving upward. The snake's next move would be to the cell above the head. Let's check where that is.\n\nThe head is at row 4 (since rows are 0-based from top). Moving UP would take it to row 3. Let's check row 3, column 3 (since the head is at (4,3), moving up is row 4-1=3, same column 3). What's in row 3, column 3? Looking at row 3: \"#      #\", so all spaces. So (3,3) is a space. So if we continue moving UP, the head would go there.\n\nBut wait, the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is UP, so the possible directions we can choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because reversing would be DOWN, which is not allowed. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's think about the apples. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible. Let's see where the apples are. In row 4, there's 'HAA' which is columns 3 (H), 4 (A), 5 (A). So in row 4, columns 4 and 5 are apples. Then in row 5, column 4 is an apple (A). So apples are at (4,4), (4,5), (5,4).\n\nThe snake's current position is (4,3). If the direction is UP, next head position is (3,3). That's empty, no apple. So no score increase. The snake would move up, leaving the previous head position (4,3) as part of the body (since the length is 1, after moving, the body would be where the head was, right? Because when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward. But since the initial length is 1, the snake is just the head. So when it moves, the head moves to the new position, and the previous head becomes the body (since the length is 1, the body is now that position). Wait, the example given: in the example, when the snake moves down and eats an apple, the next state shows the previous head position as 'S' (body). Let's look at the example again. The example's initial board has H in row 3 (assuming rows are 0-based from top), then when moving down, the head moves to row 4, and row 3's H becomes S. So yes, each movement, the head moves, and the previous positions become body segments. So if the snake doesn't eat an apple, the length remains the same, so the tail (the last body segment) is removed. But since the snake starts with length 1 (only head), moving without eating would mean the head moves, and the previous head becomes body (so length 1, but the body is now that position, but since length is 1, perhaps the body is only that one? Or maybe the initial length is 1, so when moving, the snake's body is the previous positions, but if not growing, the tail is removed. Let's think: in the example, the snake's initial position is H in row 3, and S in row 2. So initial length is 2? Because the example's initial board has S in row 2 and H in row 3, so the snake is of length 2. Then when moving down, the head goes to row 4, the row 3 H becomes S, and the row 2 S remains (so length 3, since they ate an apple). Oh, the example says \"the snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head)\". But the example's initial board has S and H. Maybe the example's initial state is after some movement. Let's not get stuck here. The problem says the snake starts with length 1 (head), and each time it eats an apple, it grows in length. So when it eats an apple, the length increases by 1. So, if the snake is length 1 (only head), and moves into an apple, then the length becomes 2. The head moves to the apple's position, and the previous head position becomes the body (S). If the snake moves into a non-apple cell, then since the length is 1, the head moves, and the previous position is no longer part of the snake (since length 1, only the new head is present). Wait, but in the example, when the snake moves down (from H in row 3 to row 4), and eats an apple (so length increases by 1, from 2 to 3?), the next state has S in row 3 (previous H) and S in row 2 (previous S), and H in row 4. So perhaps the snake's body is all the previous positions, and when it doesn't eat, the tail is removed. So for a snake of length N, each move, the head moves, and the body follows, with the tail being cut if not growing. So when you move, the new head is the direction, then the body is the previous positions up to length N-1. So if the snake is length 1, moving without eating, the head moves, and there's no body (since length 1). But perhaps the example is different. Anyway, perhaps that's not critical right now. The key is to move the snake to eat apples.\n\nBack to the current problem. The snake's head is at (4,3) (row 4, column 3). Current direction is UP. The possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse of UP, which is not allowed).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Direction UP: next head position is (3,3). What's there? Row 3 is \"#      #\", so (3,3) is a space. No apple. So no score. The snake moves there. The next epoch (epoch 2) would have the head at (3,3), and previous head (4,3) would be part of the body only if the length increased. But since no apple was eaten, length remains 1, so maybe the body is not present. So the snake's head is now at (3,3), direction is UP.\n\n2. Direction LEFT: moving left from (4,3) would take the head to (4,2). Let's check (4,2) in row 4: \"#  HAA #\". So row 4 is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: 'A', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (4,2) is a space (column 2). So moving left would take the head to (4,2), which is empty. No apple. So no score.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT: moving right from (4,3) is (4,4). Let's check (4,4): that's 'A' (since row 4 is \"#  HAA #\", so column 4 is 'A'). Oh! So if we choose RIGHT direction, the head moves to (4,4), which is an apple. So the snake eats the apple, score increases by 1, and the snake grows in length. That's good. Because eating the apple would make the snake longer, which is the goal.\n\nSo the best move here is to go RIGHT, because that's an apple. Let's confirm. The current head is at (4,3). Moving RIGHT (column +1) to (4,4), which is 'A'. So yes, that's an apple. So choosing RIGHT would result in eating the apple. The next state would have the head at (4,4), and the previous head (4,3) becomes part of the body (since the length increases by 1, from 1 to 2). So the body 'S' would be at (4,3). \n\nAre there any collision issues? The new head position (4,4) is within the board (since the board is 8x8, rows 0-7, columns 0-7. Row 4 is valid, column 4 is valid, and not a wall. So no collision with walls. And since the snake was length 1 before, there's no body to collide with. So moving RIGHT is safe and will eat an apple.

First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the current epoch is 1. The snake's head is 'H', and since the snake starts with length 1, there's no 'S' (body) yet. The apples are 'A's. \n\nThe snake is moving UP. Let's recall the rules: the snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is UP, the snake can't immediately go DOWN. The possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is the reverse and not allowed).\n\nLet's find the position of the head. Looking at the board, the 4th row (since rows are 0-indexed from top, let's check each row):\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #      # → spaces\nRow 2: #   A  # → has an A at (2,3) (assuming columns 0-7, row 2, column 3)\nRow 3: #      # → spaces\nRow 4: #  HA  # → let's parse this. The row is \"#  HA  #\", so positions 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is 'H', 4 is 'A', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So head 'H' is at (4,3). \nRow 5: #A     # → A at (5,1)\nRow 6: #      # → spaces\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the head is at (row 4, column 3). Current direction is UP. So if the snake continues moving UP, the next position would be row 3, column 3 (since moving up decreases the row number by 1). Let's check that cell. The current row 3 is \"#      #\", so (3,3) is a space (no wall, no body, no apple). So moving UP would take the head to (3,3). That's safe, no collision. But there's no apple there, so the snake doesn't eat anything, and the length remains 1.\n\nWhat about other directions? Let's check possible directions. The snake can't reverse, so current direction is UP, so possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse).\n\nLEFT: If direction is LEFT, the snake's head would move to (4,2). Let's check row 4, column 2. The row 4 is \"#  HA  #\", so column 2 is ' ' (since positions are 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: 'A'). So (4,2) is a space. No collision. No apple here. So moving LEFT would be safe, but no apple.\n\nRIGHT: Direction RIGHT would move the head to (4,4). Let's check row 4, column 4. The row 4 is \"#  HA  #\", so column 4 is 'A' (since H is at 3, then 4 is A). Oh, right! So (4,4) is an apple. If the snake moves RIGHT, the head would go to (4,4), which is an 'A'. That means the snake eats the apple, score increases by 1, and the snake grows in length. \n\nWait, let's confirm. Current head position is (4,3). Moving RIGHT (column +1) would take it to (4,4). The cell (4,4) is 'A' in the current board. So that's an apple. So eating that apple would be good. Also, moving RIGHT is allowed because the current direction is UP, and RIGHT is not the reverse direction (reverse of UP is DOWN). So the direction change from UP to RIGHT is allowed.\n\nWhat about the other possible direction, UP. Moving UP to (3,3) is safe but no apple. So moving RIGHT would get an apple immediately. That's better. Let's check if there's any collision possible. The snake's length is 1, so no body parts. So moving to (4,4) (the apple) is safe. No walls (since row 4 is within 0-7, column 4 is 0-7). So that's a valid move. \n\nSo the best direction here is RIGHT, which allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at row 4, column 3. The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to row 3, column 3 (a blank space), with no apple eaten.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to row 4, column 2 (a blank space), with no apple eaten.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to row 4, column 4, which is occupied by an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and allows the snake to grow safely (no collision with walls or itself).  \n\nChoosing RIGHT is optimal as it immediately allows the snake to eat an apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Each row is 8 characters.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #      # (so positions (1,1) to (1,6) are empty)\nRow 2: # A    # → (2,2) is 'A' (apple)\nRow 3: #  A   # → (3,3) is 'A'\nRow 4: #  H A # → (4,3) is 'H' (head), (4,5) is 'A' (apple)\nRow 5: #      # → empty\nRow 6: #      # → empty\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the snake's head is at (4,3). The current direction is UP. Since the snake is moving UP, the next position if it continues UP would be (3,3) (since moving up from row 4 to row 3, same column 3). Let's check what's at (3,3): that's an 'A' (apple). Oh, right! Because row 3 is \"#  A   #\", so column 3 (since columns are 0-based) would be index 3. Let's confirm:\n\nRow 3: characters are [0]'#', [1]' ', [2]' ', [3]'A', [4]' ', [5]' ', [6]' ', [7]'#'. So (3,3) is 'A'. So if the snake moves UP (current direction), the head moves to (3,3), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple will grow the snake and increase the score. \n\nBut wait, the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is UP. The possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. But reversing would be if current direction is UP, then DOWN is reverse. So the player can choose UP, LEFT, RIGHT, but not DOWN (since that's reversing). Wait, the problem says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So, if current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's consider each possible direction:\n\n1. UP: Moving to (3,3) which is 'A'. So the snake eats the apple. The snake's length increases. The new head is at (3,3), and since it ate an apple, the body will grow. The previous head (4,3) becomes part of the body (so 'S'). The apple at (3,3) is removed, and a new apple might be placed, but the example shows that after eating, the apple is gone. In the example given, after moving down, the head moves to where the apple was, and the previous head becomes 'S'. So in this case, moving UP would result in the head at (3,3), the old head (4,3) becomes 'S', and the apple at (3,3) is eaten. That's a good move because it gets an apple, no collision.\n\n2. LEFT: The snake would turn left. Current direction is UP, turning left would mean direction is LEFT. Then the next position would be (4,2) (since moving left from column 3 to 2, same row 4). Let's check (4,2): in row 4, the string is \"#  H A #\", which is [0]'#', [1]' ', [2]' ', [3]'H', [4]' ', [5]'A', [6]' ', [7]'#'. So (4,2) is ' ' (empty). So moving left would take the head to (4,2). No apple here, so the snake doesn't grow. But no collision, so that's safe. But why not go for the apple?\n\n3. RIGHT: Turning right from UP would mean direction is RIGHT. Then the next position is (4,4) (row 4, column 4). Let's check row 4, column 4: the row is \"#  H A #\", so positions are 0:'#', 1:' ', 2:' ', 3:'H', 4:' ', 5:'A', 6:' ', 7:'#'. So (4,4) is ' ', empty. So moving right would take the head to (4,4), no apple. So no score gain here.\n\n4. DOWN: Reversing direction. Current direction is UP, so DOWN is reverse. Not allowed. So can't choose DOWN.\n\nSo the best option is to continue moving UP, which leads to eating the apple at (3,3). That's the optimal move because it increases the score and the snake grows. There's no collision risk here because (3,3) is an apple, not a wall or body (since the snake is length 1, no body yet). So moving UP is safe and beneficial.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4, 3) (row 4, column 3) and is currently moving UP. The possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is a reverse direction and not allowed). \n\n- If moving UP: The next head position is (3, 3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1, grow the snake, and avoid collision (no walls or body parts here).\n- If moving LEFT: The next head position is (4, 2), which is empty. No apple is eaten, so no score gain.\n- If moving RIGHT: The next head position is (4, 4), which is empty. No apple is eaten, so no score gain.\n\nThe optimal choice is to continue moving UP to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: UP",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the current epoch is 1. The snake's head is 'H', and right now, looking at the board, the 'H' is in the fourth row (since rows are 0-indexed maybe? Let's check. Let's list the rows from top to bottom as rows 0 to 7. So row 0 is the top wall: ########. Row 1: #      #. Row 2: #  A  A#. Row 3: #      #. Row 4: # AH   #. Row 5: #      #. Row 6: #      #. Row 7: ########. \n\nSo in row 4, the characters are: #, space, A, space, H, space, space, #. So the 'H' is at position (4,4) if we consider (row, column). Let's confirm: row 4 (since row 0 is top), column 4 (columns 0 to 7). Because the row is \"# AH   #\", which breaks down as: index 0: #, 1: space, 2: A, 3: space, 4: H, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So H is at (4,4). \n\nThe current direction is UP. So the snake is moving up. Let's think about where the head would move next if the direction remains UP. Moving up from (4,4) would take it to row 3, column 4. Let's check row 3: \"#      #\", which is all spaces except the walls. So (3,4) is a space. So if the snake continues moving UP, the next head position would be (3,4). Since that's a space, no collision, and no apple. The snake's body would follow, but since the snake's length is 1 (started with length 1, hasn't eaten any apples yet), there's no body. So after moving up, the head is at (3,4), and the previous position (4,4) becomes empty (since no body). But wait, the snake's length is 1, so moving forward, the head moves to the new position, and the old position is no longer part of the snake. So that's safe.\n\nBut maybe there's an apple nearby. Let's look at the current position of the head (4,4). To the left (column 3) is a space, to the right (column 5) is a space. Below (row 5, column 4) is a space. Above (row 3, column 4) is a space. But in row 4, column 2 is an 'A' (position (4,2)). So that's to the left of the head (since head is at (4,4), column 2 is two columns left). \n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The player can choose to change direction, but cannot reverse. Since current direction is UP, the snake can't reverse to DOWN. So possible directions are UP (current), LEFT, RIGHT. Because reversing would be DOWN, which is not allowed.\n\nSo possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. Direction UP: The head moves to (3,4). That's a space. No apple eaten. The snake remains length 1. No collision. Safe.\n\n2. Direction LEFT: The snake turns left. Since current direction is UP, turning left is allowed (not reversing). Moving left from (4,4) would take the head to (4,3). Let's check (4,3): in row 4, the characters are #, space, A, space, H, space, space, #. So (4,3) is a space. No apple. Then the head moves there, safe.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT: The snake turns right. Moving right from (4,4) to (4,5). (4,5) is a space. Safe.\n\nBut wait, there's an 'A' at (4,2). How can the snake reach that? If the snake moves left twice. Let's see. Current position (4,4). If direction is LEFT, next move is (4,3). Then, if direction remains LEFT (since the next direction can't reverse, but after moving left, the current direction would be LEFT, so next possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN (since reversing LEFT would be RIGHT). Wait, no: the direction can't reverse. So if the current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. So, perhaps moving left now would allow the snake to reach the apple at (4,2) in the next step.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the current apples. The apples are at (2,2), (2,5), and (4,2) (since row 2 is #  A  A#, which would be positions (2,2) and (2,5), and row 4 has # AH   #, so (4,2) is A). So three apples.\n\nThe head is at (4,4). The apple at (4,2) is two steps to the left. So if the snake turns left (direction LEFT), then next move is (4,3). Then, if the direction remains LEFT, next move is (4,2), which is the apple. Then, eating that apple would increase the score and grow the snake.\n\nBut in the current step (epoch 1), the player needs to choose a direction. Let's see if any direction leads to eating an apple now.\n\nCurrent head position (4,4). Let's check adjacent cells:\n\nUp: (3,4) → space.\n\nDown: (5,4) → space. But direction can't be DOWN because current direction is UP (reversing is not allowed). So can't choose DOWN.\n\nLeft: (4,3) → space.\n\nRight: (4,5) → space.\n\nSo none of the adjacent cells have an apple. So the snake can't eat an apple in this move. So the next step's goal is to move towards an apple to eat it in the next steps.\n\nWhich apple is closest? Let's calculate the distance.\n\nApple at (4,2): distance from (4,4) is 2 (columns difference). So two steps left.\n\nApple at (2,2): row 2, column 2. Distance from (4,4) is (4-2) rows up and (4-2) columns left → 2 up, 2 left. So total steps (maybe Manhattan distance 4).\n\nApple at (2,5): row 2, column 5. Distance from (4,4) is 2 up (rows 4 to 2) and 1 right (columns 4 to 5). Manhattan distance 3.\n\nSo the closest apple is (4,2), two steps to the left. So to reach that, the snake should start moving left.\n\nSo if the current direction is UP, and the player chooses LEFT, then the next position is (4,3). Then, the next direction could be LEFT again (since after moving left, the current direction is LEFT, so can't reverse to RIGHT). Then the next move would be (4,2), which is the apple. That would be epoch 2: move left to (4,3). Epoch 3: move left again to (4,2), eat the apple. That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake continues moving up (direction UP), then in epoch 2, the head is at (3,4). Then, what's around (3,4)? Let's check row 3: \"#      #\". So (3,4) is space. Then, possible directions from there: since the current direction would be UP (if we kept moving up), so next possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. From (3,4), moving up would go to (2,4). Let's check row 2: \"#  A  A#\". So (2,4) is a space (since row 2 is positions 0: #, 1: space, 2: A, 3: space, 4: space, 5: A, 6: space, 7: #). So (2,4) is space. Then, in epoch 3, moving up to (2,4), which is space. Then, maybe moving left to (2,3), then (2,2) which is an apple. But that's further away.\n\nSo the closest apple is (4,2). So the best direction now is to turn LEFT, to start moving towards that apple. So the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The goal is to move toward the nearest apple to maximize score. \n\nThe apples are at (2,2), (2,5), and (4,2). The closest apple is at (4,2), which is 2 columns to the left of the head. To reach this apple, the snake should start moving left. \n\nPossible directions: UP (current), LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is invalid as it reverses direction). Moving LEFT will position the head at (4,3) next, allowing the snake to continue left in subsequent epochs to reach the apple at (4,2). \n\nAnswer: LEFT",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

First, I need to look at the current game board and the current direction. The snake is moving UP, and the current epoch is 1, so the game hasn't ended yet. \n\nFirst, let's parse the game board. The board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). Let's list out the positions. The rows are from top to bottom, I think. Let's index them as row 0 (top) to row 7 (bottom).\n\nRow 0: ######## (walls)\nRow 1: #A     # (so column 1 has an 'A', others are empty except walls)\nRow 2: #      # (all empty except walls)\nRow 3: # A    # (column 2 has 'A')\nRow 4: #  H  A# (column 3 is 'H', column 5 is 'A')\nRow 5: #      # (empty)\nRow 6: #      # (empty)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at row 4, column 3 (assuming rows start at 0). The current direction is UP, which means the next move (epoch 1 to 2) will be moving the head up one cell. Let's check where that would take the head. Moving UP from (row 4, column 3) would be to row 3, column 3. Let's check what's there. \n\nLooking at row 3: # A    #. The columns are 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: '#'. So row 3, column 3 is empty (a space). So if the snake continues moving UP, the head moves to (3,3). Since the snake's length is 1 (just the head), there's no body to collide with. Also, (3,3) is within the walls (since row 3 is between 0 and 7, and column 3 is between 0 and 7, but the walls are at column 0 and 6). So that's safe. But are there any apples in that direction?\n\nWait, the snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's see the positions of the apples. Current apples are at row 1, column 1 (A), row 3, column 2 (A), and row 4, column 5 (A). The head is at (4,3). The current direction is UP. If we move UP, the next head position is (3,3). The cell (3,3) is empty, so no apple eaten. \n\nWhat if we change direction? The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is UP. So the possible directions are UP (current, allowed), LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (but DOWN is reverse of UP, so that's not allowed). Wait, the rules say the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is UP, the snake can't turn to DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Continue UP: head moves to (3,3). No apple here. The new head position is safe (no wall, no body). The snake's length remains 1.\n\n2. Turn LEFT: direction is LEFT. The snake was moving UP, so turning LEFT is allowed (not reverse). Moving LEFT from (4,3) would take the head to (4,2). Let's check row 4: #  H  A#. Columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: '#'. So (4,2) is empty. No apple here. So no score increase. Safe.\n\n3. Turn RIGHT: direction is RIGHT. Moving RIGHT from (4,3) is (4,4). Row 4, column 4 is empty. No apple. Safe.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at row 4, column 5 (A). So if the snake moves RIGHT twice, it would reach there, but that's next steps. Let's check if any direction leads to an apple in the next move.\n\nLooking at possible next positions:\n\n- UP: (3,3) → no apple.\n- LEFT: (4,2) → no apple.\n- RIGHT: (4,4) → no apple.\n- DOWN: (5,3) → current direction is UP, can't reverse to DOWN. So that's invalid.\n\nWait, but the apple at row 4, column 5 is in the same row as the head (row 4). The head is at column 3. So to reach that apple, the snake would need to move RIGHT twice (from 3 to 4, then 4 to 5). But in the next move (epoch 1), moving RIGHT would take it to (4,4), which is empty. Then, in the next epoch (epoch 2), if it continues RIGHT, then (4,5) which is the apple. But the question is, which direction to choose now (epoch 1) to maximize apple eating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple in the direction of UP. Let's check row 3 again. Row 3 is \"# A    #\", so column 2 (A) is at (3,2). The head is moving UP to (3,3). So (3,2) is to the left of (3,3). So if the snake moves UP and then LEFT, it can reach that apple. But perhaps that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at row 1, column 1. The head is at (4,3). To reach (1,1), the snake would need to move UP three times (from row 4 to 3, 2, 1) and then LEFT twice (from column 3 to 2, 1). But that's multiple steps.\n\nBut since the snake starts with length 1, and the game ends after 100 epochs, we need to choose the direction that leads to eating apples as soon as possible.\n\nWait, let's check all current apple positions again. Let's list their coordinates (row, column):\n\n- Apple 1: row 1, column 1.\n- Apple 2: row 3, column 2.\n- Apple 3: row 4, column 5.\n\nHead is at (4,3). So:\n\nDistance to Apple 3 (4,5): column difference is 5-3=2 (right). So two RIGHT moves.\n\nDistance to Apple 2 (3,2): row difference 4-3=1 (up), column difference 3-2=1 (left). So one UP, one LEFT.\n\nDistance to Apple 1 (1,1): row difference 4-1=3 (up), column difference 3-1=2 (left). So three UP, two LEFT.\n\nSo the closest apple is Apple 2 (distance 2 steps) and Apple 3 (distance 2 steps). Let's see which can be reached first.\n\nIf the snake moves UP (current direction) to (3,3) (epoch 1 move), then next direction could be LEFT to (3,2) (epoch 2), which is Apple 2. That would be two steps.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake turns RIGHT now (epoch 1) to (4,4), then next move RIGHT (epoch 2) to (4,5), which is Apple 3. That's also two steps.\n\nSo either path is possible. But what's the current direction. The current direction is UP, so if we choose to go UP, then next move can be LEFT (since after moving UP, the direction is UP, and then turning LEFT is allowed).\n\nAlternatively, if we turn RIGHT now (epoch 1 direction), then the direction becomes RIGHT, and next move can be RIGHT again (since direction can be maintained). So that's allowed.\n\nBut which direction is better? Let's check if moving in any direction would cause collision. Since the snake is length 1, there's no body, so the only collision possible is with walls.\n\nThe head's current position is (4,3). Let's check the possible next positions:\n\n- UP: (3,3). Walls are at row 0 and 7. (3,3) is within row 1-6 (since row 0 is top wall, row 7 is bottom). Columns 0 and 6 are walls. Column 3 is within 1-5, so safe.\n\n- LEFT: (4,2). Column 2 is within 1-5 (columns 0 and 6 are walls), so safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (4,4). Column 4 is within 1-5, safe.\n\n- DOWN: (5,3). Row 5 is within 1-6, safe, but direction is reverse (current is UP, so can't choose DOWN).\n\nSo all possible directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads to the next apple in the next step? Let's see:\n\nIf we go UP (to (3,3)), then next possible directions (since direction is now UP) could be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't go DOWN). The next position would be (2,3) if we go UP again. (2,3) is empty. Alternatively, LEFT from (3,3) would take us to (3,2), which is Apple 2. So in epoch 2, if we move LEFT, we eat that apple.\n\nIf we go RIGHT (to (4,4)), then direction is RIGHT. Next move could be RIGHT again (to (4,5)), which is Apple 3. So in epoch 2, moving RIGHT would eat that apple.\n\nSo both paths take two steps. But which is better? Since both are possible, perhaps either direction is acceptable. But maybe the question expects to choose the direction that can reach an apple in the next possible step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple in the current direction's next step. Let's check again: moving UP to (3,3) — no apple. Moving LEFT to (4,2) — no apple. Moving RIGHT to (4,4) — no apple. So none of the immediate next steps have apples. So the next apple would be in step 2.\n\nBut since the snake can choose any direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT), perhaps the best is to choose a direction that allows reaching an apple as soon as possible. Since both paths take two steps, perhaps either is okay. But perhaps the problem expects to choose the direction that leads to the apple that's in the same row or column.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the positions again. The head is at (4,3). Apple 3 is at (4,5), same row (row 4), two columns to the right. So if we move RIGHT now (epoch 1), head goes to (4,4), then RIGHT again (epoch 2) to (4,5) which is the apple. That would result in eating the apple in epoch 2.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP (epoch 1) to (3,3), then LEFT (epoch 2) to (3,2) (Apple 2). Also two steps.\n\nSo either direction (UP, RIGHT, or LEFT) could be acceptable, but perhaps the optimal is to go towards the closest apple. Since both are two steps away, maybe the answer is to choose RIGHT, as moving towards the apple in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better option. Let me think again. The current direction is UP. If we continue moving UP, the next position is (3,3). Then, from there, moving LEFT would get to (3,2) (Apple 2). That's possible. But if we turn RIGHT now, moving to (4,4), then next move RIGHT to (4,5) (Apple 3). That's also possible.\n\nSince both options are valid, but perhaps the problem expects the direction that leads to the apple in the next step. But since neither direction leads to an apple in the immediate next step (epoch 1), perhaps any direction is acceptable, but the snake should choose a direction that doesn't block itself. But since the snake is length 1, there's no body, so any direction is safe.\n\nBut maybe the best choice is to go towards the apple that's in the same row. So moving RIGHT. Let's decide that. So the direction to choose is RIGHT.\n\n\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  H  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently at position (row 4, column 3) and moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 3, column 3), which is empty (no apple). Safe.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 4, column 2), which is empty (no apple). Safe.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 4, column 4), which is empty (no apple). Safe.  \n\nThe goal is to eat apples. The closest apples are at (row 3, column 2) and (row 4, column 5). Moving RIGHT now positions the snake to reach the apple at (row 4, column 5) in the next move (by continuing RIGHT), while moving UP positions it to reach the apple at (row 3, column 2) in the next move (by turning LEFT). Both paths are valid, but moving RIGHT aligns with the apple in the same row, making it a direct path. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: \n\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"","response":["Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move. First, I need to look at the current game board and the current direction. The snake is currently moving UP, and the epoch is 1, so it's early in the game.\n\nThe game board is 8x8 with walls around. Let's parse the board row by row. The rows are from top to bottom. The first row is ########, which is the top wall. Then the next rows:\n\nRow 1 (second line): #      # → so columns 1-6 are empty (since # is at 0 and 7).\nRow 2 (third line): #      # → same as row 1.\nRow 3 (fourth line): #      # → same.\nRow 4 (fifth line): #  H   # → So the head 'H' is at (4,2) if we consider rows starting from 0. Wait, rows are 0-indexed? Let's clarify: the first line is row 0. So row 0: ######## (all walls). Row 1: #      # → positions (1,0) and (1,7) are walls, (1,1)-(1,6) are empty. Similarly, row 2: (2,0) and (2,7) are walls, others empty. Row 3: same. Row 4: #  H   # → so (4,0) is #, (4,1) is space, (4,2) is H, (4,3)-(4,6) are spaces, (4,7) is #. So H is at (row 4, column 2). \n\nRow 5: #  A   # → (5,0) is #, (5,1) space, (5,2) A, (5,3)-(5,6) space, (5,7) #. So A at (5,2).\n\nRow 6: #  A  A# → (6,0) #, (6,1) space, (6,2) A, (6,3) space, (6,4) A, (6,5)-(6,6) space, (6,7) #. So A's at (6,2) and (6,4).\n\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall).\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. Since the snake starts with length 1, the head is the only part. So when it moves, the head moves in the current direction, and since length is 1, there's no body left behind (unless it eats an apple, which would make it grow).\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. So if current direction is UP, the snake can't go DOWN next. The possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because reversing (DOWN) is not allowed.\n\nNow, the snake is at (4,2) (row 4, column 2). Moving UP would take it to row 3, column 2. Let's check that position. Row 3 is #      #, so (3,2) is a space. So that's safe. No collision with walls or self.\n\nIf the snake moves UP (current direction), next position is (3,2). Since that's empty, no apple, so the snake's length remains 1. The head moves there, and since no apple, the body (if any) would follow, but since length is 1, the previous head position (4,2) becomes empty.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake turns LEFT (from UP, turning left is allowed). The direction would be LEFT. Then the head would move to (4,1). Let's check (4,1): in row 4, it's a space. Safe. No apple.\n\nIf the snake turns RIGHT (direction RIGHT), then head moves to (4,3). Check (4,3): row 4, column 3 is space. Safe. No apple.\n\nBut the goal is to eat apples. Let's see where the apples are. The apples are at (5,2), (6,2), (6,4). The snake's current position is (4,2). If the snake is moving UP, next step is (3,2). Then the next move (epoch 2) would depend on direction again. But maybe we can plan for the next apple.\n\nWait, current epoch is 1, so after this move, it's epoch 2. The snake's current position is (4,2). Let's see the possible moves and their outcomes.\n\nCurrent direction is UP. So possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't go DOWN).\n\nIf we choose UP: new head position is (3,2). That's empty. So the snake moves there. The previous head (4,2) becomes empty (since length is 1). No apple eaten, score remains 0.\n\nIf we choose LEFT: direction becomes LEFT. The head moves to (4,1). (4,1) is space. No apple. Score 0.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: direction becomes RIGHT. Head moves to (4,3). (4,3) is space. No apple. Score 0.\n\nBut wait, what if we go DOWN? Oh, no, the current direction is UP, so reversing to DOWN is not allowed. So DOWN is invalid. So the possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, the snake is at (4,2). Let's look at the positions of the apples. The apples are in row 5 (row 5, column 2), row 6 (row 6, column 2 and 4). So the apple at (5,2) is directly below the current head. Because current head is (4,2), row 5 is below (since row numbers increase as we go down). So (5,2) is one step down from (4,2).\n\nBut the current direction is UP, so the snake can't reverse to DOWN. So the next move can't be DOWN. So the snake can't go directly down to (5,2) in this move. But perhaps if the snake changes direction in a way that allows it to reach the apples in the next steps.\n\nWait, but the snake is moving UP. So the next move (epoch 1's move) will take it to (3,2). Then, in epoch 2, the snake can change direction again. Let's think: if we go UP now (epoch 1), then in epoch 2, the snake's direction is UP (since we chose to continue moving UP). Then, in epoch 2, the snake would move to (2,2). Then, in epoch 3, (1,2), which is row 1, column 2 (safe). Then, in epoch 4, (0,2) which is a wall (row 0 is all #), so that's a collision. So that path would lead to death in 4 moves.\n\nAlternatively, if we turn RIGHT now (epoch 1), direction becomes RIGHT. So head moves to (4,3). Then, in epoch 2, possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN (since current direction is RIGHT, can't reverse to LEFT). So if in epoch 2, we go DOWN, direction becomes DOWN. Then head moves to (5,3). Then, check for apples. (5,3) is empty. Then, in epoch 3, direction is DOWN, so head moves to (6,3). (6,3) is space. Then, (7,3) is a wall. So that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, if we turn LEFT now (epoch 1), direction LEFT. Head moves to (4,1). Then next direction could be LEFT (but then (4,0) is a wall), so better to go DOWN. But direction after LEFT can't be RIGHT (reverse). So possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nBut perhaps the best approach is to head towards the apples. The apples are in row 5 and 6. The snake is in row 4. To reach those apples, the snake needs to go down. But since current direction is UP, the snake can't reverse to DOWN in the first move. So the snake needs to change direction to either LEFT or RIGHT, then turn down.\n\nLet's think: if the snake moves RIGHT (direction RIGHT) in epoch 1. Then head is at (4,3). Then, in epoch 2, the direction can be DOWN (since current direction is RIGHT, turning down is allowed, not a reverse). Then, moving DOWN from (4,3) would take the head to (5,3). Then, in epoch 3, direction is DOWN, head moves to (6,3). Then, in epoch 4, direction could be RIGHT (from DOWN, can turn right), moving to (6,4) which is an apple! That's (6,4) which is an 'A'. So in epoch 4, the snake would eat that apple, grow, and score increases by 1. That's a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake first moves UP (epoch 1) to (3,2). Then, in epoch 2, direction can be DOWN (since current direction is UP, can't reverse to DOWN? Wait, no. The rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So if current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN (reverse). So after moving UP (epoch 1), the direction is UP, so in epoch 2, possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't go DOWN). So if the snake is at (3,2) (epoch 2), direction is UP, then in epoch 2's move, it would go to (2,2). Then epoch 3, direction UP again, (1,2). Epoch 4, (0,2) which is a wall. So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, after moving UP to (3,2) (epoch 1), in epoch 2, the snake turns LEFT (direction LEFT). Then, head moves to (3,1). Then epoch 3, direction LEFT again would take to (3,0), which is a wall. So that's bad. So perhaps moving UP first isn't the best.\n\nAnother option: moving LEFT in epoch 1. So head is at (4,1). Then, in epoch 2, direction can be DOWN (since current direction is LEFT, so possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN). So moving DOWN from (4,1) to (5,1). Then, (5,1) is space. Then epoch 3, direction DOWN again to (6,1). (6,1) is space. Then epoch 4, direction RIGHT (from DOWN, can turn right), moving to (6,2), which is an apple. So that's (6,2) which is an 'A'. So that's a possible path to an apple in epoch 4.\n\nBut perhaps the closest apple is (5,2). The snake is at (4,2). (5,2) is directly below. But since current direction is UP, the snake can't go DOWN in epoch 1. So the snake needs to move in a way that allows it to turn around. For example, move UP once, then turn around. Wait, but after moving UP (epoch 1) to (3,2), direction is UP, so can't turn to DOWN. So to get to (5,2), the snake needs to go down. Let's see:\n\nCurrent position (4,2). If the snake moves RIGHT (epoch 1) to (4,3). Then, direction is RIGHT. Then, in epoch 2, the snake can turn DOWN (allowed, since direction is RIGHT, not reversing). So moving DOWN to (5,3). Then, in epoch 3, direction is DOWN, move to (6,3). Then, in epoch 4, turn LEFT (from DOWN, can turn left) to (6,2), which is an apple. That's (6,2) in epoch 4. So that's 3 moves to reach an apple.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves LEFT (epoch 1) to (4,1). Then, direction LEFT. Epoch 2, turn DOWN (allowed) to (5,1). Epoch 3, direction DOWN to (6,1). Epoch 4, turn RIGHT (from DOWN) to (6,2) (apple). Same as above.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let's think: if the snake can move in a direction that allows it to reach (5,2) in the next steps. (5,2) is directly below (4,2). The snake is moving UP. To get down, the snake has to first change direction to, say, LEFT or RIGHT, then turn around. For example, move LEFT (epoch 1) to (4,1), then direction LEFT. Then, in epoch 2, turn around (can't reverse direction, so can't go RIGHT, but can go UP or DOWN). So if the snake goes DOWN (epoch 2) from (4,1) to (5,1). Then, epoch 3, direction is DOWN, move to (6,1). Then, epoch 4, turn RIGHT (from DOWN, direction becomes RIGHT) to (6,2) (apple). That's 4 steps.\n\nAlternatively, what if the snake moves UP (epoch 1) to (3,2). Then, direction UP. Epoch 2, turn LEFT (direction LEFT) to (3,1). Epoch 3, direction LEFT to (3,0) (wall, bad). So that's not good.\n\nAlternatively, after moving UP to (3,2) (epoch 1), turn RIGHT (direction RIGHT) to (3,3). Then, epoch 2, direction RIGHT to (3,4). Epoch 3, direction RIGHT to (3,5). Epoch 4, direction RIGHT to (3,6). Epoch 5, direction RIGHT to (3,7) (wall, bad).\n\nHmm. So the best bet is to head towards the apples in row 5 and 6. Let's look at the positions again. The apple at (5,2) is directly below the current head. The snake is at (4,2). To reach (5,2), the snake needs to move down. But current direction is UP, so can't reverse to DOWN. So the next move can't be DOWN. So the snake has to make a detour.\n\nAnother approach: The snake's current direction is UP, so moving UP is the current path. But moving UP would take it away from the apples. The apples are in lower rows (row 5, 6), so the snake is in row 4. To reach them, the snake needs to go down. So perhaps the best strategy is to change direction to either LEFT or RIGHT, then go down towards the apples.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible direction:\n\n1. UP: Move to (3,2). No apple. Then, next direction can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't go DOWN). So moving further up, away from apples. Not good.\n\n2. LEFT: Move to (4,1). No apple. Then, next direction can be LEFT, UP, DOWN. If we go DOWN next, then towards row 5, 6. That's better.\n\n3. RIGHT: Move to (4,3). No apple. Then, next direction can be RIGHT, UP, DOWN. If we go DOWN next, towards row 5, 6. Also good.\n\nBetween LEFT and RIGHT, which is better? Let's check the positions. The apple at (5,2) is in column 2, which is the same column as the current head. If the snake moves LEFT to (4,1) (column 1), then moving down to (5,1), (6,1), then right to (6,2) (apple). If the snake moves RIGHT to (4,3) (column 3), then moving down to (5,3), (6,3), then left to (6,2) (apple) or right to (6,4) (another apple).\n\nThe apple at (6,4) is in column 4. So if the snake moves RIGHT (to 4,3) then down to (5,3), (6,3), then right to (6,4) (apple). That's (6,4) which is an apple. That's a possible path.\n\nWhich path is shorter? Let's count steps.\n\nOption 1: Move RIGHT (epoch 1) → (4,3). Then, direction RIGHT → in epoch 2, can turn DOWN (allowed). So epoch 2: move DOWN to (5,3). Epoch 3: direction DOWN, move to (6,3). Epoch 4: direction RIGHT (from DOWN, can turn right) → move to (6,4) (apple). That's 4 steps (epoch 4) to reach the apple.\n\nOption 2: Move LEFT (epoch 1) → (4,1). Epoch 2: move DOWN to (5,1). Epoch 3: move DOWN to (6,1). Epoch 4: move RIGHT to (6,2) (apple). Also 4 steps.\n\nEither way, 4 steps. But perhaps there's a closer apple. The apple at (5,2) is only one step down from the current head (4,2). But the snake can't move down in epoch 1. So the earliest it can reach (5,2) is by moving in a way that allows it to go down in epoch 2.\n\nWait, current direction is UP. So in epoch 1, the snake's direction is UP. So the snake's next move is determined by the direction input. Let's think: if the snake is moving UP, but the player inputs a direction. The snake's movement is: the direction input determines the new direction (if allowed), then the head moves one square in that direction.\n\nSo, for example, if current direction is UP, and the player inputs DOWN (which is a reverse), that's invalid. The snake can't do that. So the player must input a direction that's not the reverse of the current direction.\n\nSo possible directions are UP (continue), LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf the player inputs UP, the snake moves up. If inputs LEFT, direction becomes LEFT and moves left. If inputs RIGHT, direction becomes RIGHT and moves right.\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,2). Let's list the next positions:\n\n- UP → (3,2)\n- LEFT → (4,1)\n- RIGHT → (4,3)\n\nNone of these positions have apples, so no score increase in epoch 1.\n\nThe goal is to choose the direction that will allow the snake to reach an apple as soon as possible, avoiding walls and self-collision.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (5,2): row 5, column 2\n- (6,2): row 6, column 2\n- (6,4): row 6, column 4\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT (epoch 1) to (4,3). Then, in epoch 2, the direction can be DOWN (since current direction is RIGHT, allowed). So the snake moves DOWN to (5,3). Epoch 3: direction DOWN, move to (6,3). Epoch 4: direction RIGHT (from DOWN, allowed) → move to (6,4) (apple). That's an apple in epoch 4.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT (epoch 1) to (4,1). Epoch 2: direction DOWN → (5,1). Epoch 3: direction DOWN → (6,1). Epoch 4: direction RIGHT → (6,2) (apple). Also an apple in epoch 4.\n\nIf the snake moves UP (epoch 1) to (3,2). Then, in epoch 2, possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. If it turns LEFT to (3,1), then epoch 3 could be DOWN. Let's see:\n\nEpoch 1: UP → (3,2)\nEpoch 2: LEFT → (3,1)\nEpoch 3: DOWN → (4,1)\nEpoch 4: DOWN → (5,1)\nEpoch 5: RIGHT → (5,2) (apple). That's 5 steps, which is longer than the other options.\n\nSo moving UP is worse because it takes longer to reach an apple. So between LEFT and RIGHT, both are similar. But let's check if there are any obstacles.\n\nIn the case of moving RIGHT to (4,3):\n\n- (4,3) is safe (no wall, no self).\n- Epoch 2, moving DOWN to (5,3): safe.\n- Epoch 3, moving DOWN to (6,3): safe.\n- Epoch 4, moving RIGHT to (6,4): that's an apple. Safe.\n\nIn the case of moving LEFT to (4,1):\n\n- (4,1) is safe.\n- Epoch 2, moving DOWN to (5,1): safe.\n- Epoch 3, moving DOWN to (6,1): safe.\n- Epoch 4, moving RIGHT to (6,2): that's an apple. Safe.\n\nEither direction (LEFT or RIGHT) would work. But perhaps one of them is better. Let's see if there's any other factor. For example, the snake's body. But since the snake has length 1, there's no body, so no self-collision risk.\n\nAnother thing: the snake starts moving UP. If we choose to continue moving UP (direction UP), the snake will go towards row 3, 2, 1, 0 (wall). So that path leads to a collision in 4 steps. So UP is not a good choice.\n\nSo the best options are LEFT or RIGHT. Which one to choose? Let's see the positions of the apples. The apple at (6,4) is in column 4. If the snake goes RIGHT, then in epoch 4, it can reach (6,4). The apple at (6,2) is in column 2. If the snake goes LEFT, in epoch 4, reaches (6,2). Both are apples, so either is fine.\n\nBut perhaps the apple at (5,2) is closer. Let's see: (5,2) is in row 5, column 2. The snake is at (4,2). To reach (5,2), the snake needs to move down. But since current direction is UP, the snake can't move down in epoch 1. So the earliest possible is epoch 2. How?\n\nIf the snake moves UP (epoch 1) to (3,2), then in epoch 2, the direction can't be DOWN (reverse). So no.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT (epoch 1) to (4,1), then in epoch 2, direction can be DOWN. So from (4,1) moving down to (5,1). Then, in epoch 3, direction can be RIGHT (from DOWN, allowed) to (5,2). Oh! That's a better path. Let's re-calculate:\n\nEpoch 1: LEFT → (4,1) (direction LEFT)\nEpoch 2: DOWN → (5,1) (direction DOWN)\nEpoch 3: RIGHT → (5,2) (direction RIGHT). That's (5,2), which is an apple! So in epoch 3, the snake would reach (5,2) and eat the apple. That's faster than the previous paths.\n\nYes! Because (5,2) is in row 5, column 2. Let's check:\n\nEpoch 1: direction LEFT. Head moves from (4,2) to (4,1). Now direction is LEFT.\n\nEpoch 2: the player can input DOWN (since current direction is LEFT, the allowed directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. DOWN is allowed). So the snake's direction becomes DOWN. Head moves from (4,1) to (5,1).\n\nEpoch 3: current direction is DOWN. Allowed directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. The player can input RIGHT. So direction becomes RIGHT. Head moves from (5,1) to (5,2). Which is the apple at (5,2). So in epoch 3, the snake eats the apple. That's only 3 steps. That's better than the previous 4 steps.\n\nAh, that's a better path. So choosing LEFT in epoch 1 allows the snake to reach (5,2) in epoch 3. Let's verify:\n\nCurrent head (4,2). Epoch 1 direction LEFT → (4,1). No apple.\n\nEpoch 2 direction DOWN → (5,1). No apple.\n\nEpoch 3 direction RIGHT → (5,2). Apple here. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo why didn't I think of that earlier. So moving LEFT in epoch 1, then DOWN in epoch 2, then RIGHT in epoch 3. That's possible. Because:\n\nAfter moving LEFT (epoch 1), direction is LEFT. So in epoch 2, possible directions are LEFT (move to (4,0) which is wall), UP (move to (3,1)), or DOWN (move to (5,1)). DOWN is the best option here.\n\nThen, in epoch 2, direction is DOWN. So in epoch 3, possible directions are DOWN (move to (6,1)), LEFT (move to (5,0) wall), or RIGHT (move to (5,2) which is the apple). So choosing RIGHT in epoch 3 would take the head to (5,2), which is an apple. So that's a valid path.\n\nSo the key is that by moving LEFT first, the snake can then move down and then right to reach the apple in (5,2) in 3 steps. That's better than other options.\n\nSo the best direction to choose in epoch 1 is LEFT. Because it allows the snake to reach an apple faster.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at row 4, column 2. The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The goal is to move toward apples ('A') located at (5,2), (6,2), and (6,4). \n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,2), further from the apples in lower rows (5-6). This path leads away from apples and risks collision with the top wall in subsequent moves.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (4,1). From here, the snake can later move DOWN (allowed, as LEFT → DOWN is not a reversal) toward row 5-6. This path positions the snake to reach the apple at (5,2) in 3 steps (LEFT → DOWN → RIGHT).\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (4,3). While this also allows moving toward lower rows, reaching the nearest apple (6,4) would take 4 steps (RIGHT → DOWN → DOWN → RIGHT), which is slower than the LEFT path.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to strategically position itself to reach the closest apple (5,2) in fewer steps, avoiding walls and self-collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

I need to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, let's look at the current game board. The board is 8x8 with walls around the edges. Let me parse the board line by line.\n\nLine 0: ######## (top wall)\nLine 1: #     A# → so positions (1,5) is A (since rows are 0-7, columns 0-7; # is (1,0), then spaces until (1,5) is A, (1,7) is #)\nLine 2: #  A   # → (2,3) is A\nLine 3: #      # → all spaces except walls\nLine 4: #  HA  # → (4,2) is H (head), (4,3) is A? Wait, let's check each character. Line 4: index 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is H, 3 is A, 4 is space, 5 is space, 6 is space, 7 is #. So H is at (4,2), A is at (4,3).\nLine 5: #      # → spaces\nLine 6: #      # → spaces\nLine 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. The snake's head is at (4,2). Since the snake starts with length 1, there's no body yet (no 'S' on the board). So the snake is just the head H.\n\nThe rules say the snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is UP, so the next direction can't be DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse, so invalid).\n\nLet's think about where the head would move next for each possible direction.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,2). Let's note coordinates as (row, column). UP direction would decrease the row by 1, so (3,2). DOWN would be row +1 (5,2). LEFT is column -1 (4,1). RIGHT is column +1 (4,3).\n\nCurrent direction is UP. So the possible directions the player can choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since choosing DOWN would reverse direction, which is not allowed).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. UP: Next position (3,2). Let's see what's there. The current board's line 3 (row 3) is \"#      #\", so (3,2) is a space. So moving UP would take the head to (3,2). Since there's no apple there (no A), the snake doesn't grow. The snake's length remains 1. The new head is at (3,2), and since length is 1, the old position (4,2) becomes empty (since the snake moves, the tail (which is the same as head here) moves, so the old head position is no longer part of the snake). So the new board would have H at (3,2), and the A at (4,3) remains. But we need to check if moving UP causes a collision. The walls are around, (3,2) is within the board (rows 0-7, columns 0-7). (3,2) is not a wall, and since the snake has length 1, there's no body to collide with. So UP is safe.\n\n2. LEFT: Next position (4,1). Check the board. Line 4 is \"#  HA  #\", so (4,1) is a space (since (4,0) is #, (4,1) is space, (4,2) is H). So (4,1) is empty. Moving LEFT would take the head there. No apple, so no growth. Safe.\n\n3. RIGHT: Next position (4,3). Let's check what's there. The current head is at (4,2), and (4,3) is A (from line 4: \"#  HA  #\", so index 3 is A). So if the snake moves RIGHT (column +1), the head moves to (4,3), which is an apple. Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length. Since the snake was length 1, after eating, the length becomes 2. So the snake's body will now include the previous head position (4,2) as 'S', and the new head is at (4,3) as 'H'. Let's confirm the example given in the problem statement. In the example, when moving down into an apple, the old head becomes 'S' and the new head is 'H' where the apple was. So that's correct. So moving RIGHT would eat the apple. That's good because it increases the score. Also, (4,3) is within the board (row 4, column 3 is valid, not a wall). And since the snake is length 1, no body to collide with. So moving RIGHT is safe and gains a point.\n\nSo which direction is best? The goal is to eat as many apples as possible. The RIGHT direction leads to an immediate apple. So that's the best choice. Let's confirm the possible directions again. The current direction is UP, so possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Choosing RIGHT would move into the A at (4,3), which is an apple, so that's optimal. So the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4,2) (row 4, column 2), and the current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the next direction cannot be DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving to (3,2) (row 3, column 2), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,1) (row 4, column 1), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (4,3) (row 4, column 3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length (the previous head position (4,2) becomes 'S', and the new head is at (4,3) as 'H'). This direction is safe (no collision with walls or self) and gains a point.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move RIGHT to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, let's look at the current game board and the current direction.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the current epoch is 1. The snake starts with length 1 (just the head 'H'), and is moving up. The snake can't reverse direction, so from UP, it can't go DOWN. The possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reversing).\n\nFirst, let's find the head's position. The head 'H' is in row 4 (since rows are 0-7, top to bottom). Let's check each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #      # (so positions (1,1) to (1,6) are empty)\nRow 2: #    A # → (2,4) is A (columns 1-6)\nRow 3: #    A # → (3,4) is A\nRow 4: #  H   # → (4,3) is H (since there's a space before and after, so column 3)\nRow 5: # A    # → (5,2) is A\nRow 6: #      # → empty\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo the head is at (4,3). Current direction is UP. When moving UP, the next position would be (3,3). Let's check what's there. Row 3 is \"#    A #\", so (3,3) is a space (since (3,4) is A). So moving UP would take the head to (3,3), which is empty. Then the snake's body would be added where the head was, but since the length is 1, the body would be at (4,3) as 'S'? Wait, the example shows that when moving, the head moves, and the body follows. For a length 1 snake, moving in direction UP, the head moves to the new position, and the previous head position becomes part of the body? Wait, the example given: initial board has H in row 3 (assuming 0-based), and after moving DOWN (so head moves down to row 4), the previous H position (row 3) becomes S, and the new head is at row 4. So for a snake of length 1, moving in direction D, the head moves to (4,3), and the previous (3,3) becomes S. So for the current case, the snake is length 1, moving UP. So next position would be (3,3). Let's check if that's a valid move.\n\nCheck collision: (3,3) is within the board (since row 3 is between 1 and 6, columns 3 is between 1 and 6). So walls are only at the edges (rows 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7). So (3,3) is safe, no wall collision. Also, since the snake is length 1, there's no body to collide with. So moving UP is safe.\n\nBut maybe there's an apple in other directions. Let's check possible directions.\n\nPossible directions (can't reverse, so from UP, can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT):\n\n1. UP: next position (3,3). What's there? Let's check row 3: \"#    A #\". So columns 1: #, 2: space, 3: space, 4: A, 5: space, 6: #. So (3,3) is space. So no apple here. The snake would move there, no growth.\n\n2. LEFT: direction is LEFT. The next position is (4,2). Let's check (4,2). Row 4 is \"#  H   #\". The H is at (4,3), so (4,2) is a space (since it's two spaces from the left, then H). So (4,2) is space. So moving left would take the head to (4,2), which is empty. Safe, no collision.\n\n3. RIGHT: direction is RIGHT. Next position (4,4). Check row 4: \"#  H   #\". H is at (4,3), so (4,4) is a space. So (4,4) is space. Moving right is safe.\n\n4. DOWN: direction is DOWN. But current direction is UP, so reversing direction is not allowed. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nNow, let's check if any of these directions lead to an apple. The apples are at:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 2, column 4: A (row 2, col 4)\nRow 3, column 4: A (row 3, col 4)\nRow 5, column 2: A (row 5, col 2)\n\nSo positions of apples are (2,4), (3,4), (5,2).\n\nCurrent head is (4,3). Let's see possible next positions:\n\nIf moving UP: (3,3). Check if (3,3) is an apple? No, (3,4) is A. So (3,3) is empty.\n\nIf moving LEFT: (4,2). Check (4,2): row 4 is \"#  H   #\", so (4,2) is space. (5,2) is A. So (4,2) is empty.\n\nIf moving RIGHT: (4,4). (4,4) is space. (3,4) is A. So (4,4) is space.\n\nSo none of the next positions in the possible directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) have an apple. So the snake won't eat any apple in the next move. So the goal is to choose a direction that leads towards apples, avoiding future collisions.\n\nLet's think about the snake's path. The current direction is UP. Let's see where moving UP would take it. Next head position (3,3). Then, the next move (epoch 2) direction could be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since current direction would then be UP again). Let's see where that would go.\n\nIf we move UP now (epoch 1), then in epoch 2, the direction could be UP again. The next position would be (2,3). Check (2,3): row 2 is \"#    A #\". Columns 1-6: (2,1)=#, (2,2)=space, (2,3)=space, (2,4)=A, (2,5)=space, (2,6)=#. So (2,3) is space. Then in epoch 3, moving UP again would take to (1,3), which is row 1, column 3. Row 1 is \"#      #\", so (1,3) is space. Then moving UP again (epoch 4) would take to (0,3), which is a wall (row 0 is all #). So that's a collision. So moving UP multiple times would lead to a wall in 3 steps. So that's bad.\n\nIf we move LEFT now (epoch 1), head goes to (4,2). Then next direction can be LEFT, UP, or DOWN (but can't reverse from LEFT to RIGHT). Wait, after moving LEFT, the current direction becomes LEFT. So next possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN (since reversing would be RIGHT, which is not allowed). Let's see. (4,2) is the new head. Then, moving LEFT again would take to (4,1). (4,1) is row 4, column 1. Row 4 is \"#  H   #\", so (4,1) is # (since row 4 starts with #, then two spaces (columns 2 and 3) where H was, then more spaces). Wait, row 4 is \"#  H   #\", so columns 0 is #, column 1 is space? Wait, let's clarify the board. Each row is 8 characters. Let's index columns 0-7 (left to right).\n\nRow 4: \"#  H   #\" → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (4,1) is ' ', (4,2) is ' ', (4,3) is 'H', etc.\n\nSo moving LEFT from (4,3) (current head) would take to (4,2), which is ' '.\n\nThen, if direction is LEFT again, next position (4,1), which is ' ' (safe). Then again LEFT to (4,0), which is a wall (column 0 is #). So that's a collision in 3 steps.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT then UP: (4,2) → (3,2). (3,2) is space (row 3: \"#    A #\", column 2 is space). Then, from (3,2), direction could be UP (to (2,2)), which is space, etc.\n\nWhat about moving RIGHT now (epoch 1). Head moves to (4,4). Then direction is RIGHT. Next possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN (can't reverse to LEFT). (4,4) is space. Moving RIGHT again would take to (4,5), which is space. Then (4,6) is space. Then (4,7) is # (wall). So (4,7) is column 7, which is a wall, so collision in 3 steps.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT then UP: (4,4) → (3,4). Oh, (3,4) is an apple! Because row 3 has \"#    A #\", so column 4 is A. So if we move RIGHT now (epoch 1) to (4,4), then in epoch 2, direction could be UP, which would take the head to (3,4), which is an apple. That would be good because eating the apple would grow the snake and increase the score.\n\nLet's outline this path:\n\nEpoch 1: current direction UP. Choose to move RIGHT. New head position (4,4). The previous head (4,3) becomes 'S' (since snake length is 1, moving makes the body follow). So the new board after epoch 1 would have H at (4,4) and S at (4,3).\n\nEpoch 2: current direction is RIGHT (since we moved RIGHT in epoch 1). But wait, when you change direction, the current direction becomes the new direction. So after moving RIGHT, the current direction is RIGHT. So in epoch 2, the possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN (can't reverse to LEFT). If we choose UP in epoch 2, that's allowed (since current direction is RIGHT, and UP is not reversing). So in epoch 2, moving UP would take the head from (4,4) to (3,4), which is the apple. Then, the snake eats the apple, grows, and the score increases by 1. That's a good move.\n\nSo, the plan is to move RIGHT now (epoch 1), then in epoch 2 move UP to reach the apple at (3,4). So moving RIGHT in epoch 1 is better than other directions because it sets up the next move to reach an apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP now (epoch 1) would take the head to (3,3). Then in epoch 2, direction can be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. If in epoch 2, direction is RIGHT, then head moves to (3,4), which is the apple. That's another possible path. Let's check that:\n\nEpoch 1: move UP → head at (3,3). Current direction is UP.\n\nEpoch 2: possible directions UP, LEFT, RIGHT. If we move RIGHT from (3,3), head moves to (3,4) which is A. So that's even better. Because in epoch 2, moving RIGHT would reach the apple.\n\nWait, let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head (4,3). Moving UP (epoch 1) → (3,3). Then, in epoch 2, current direction is UP. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. If we choose RIGHT, then the head moves from (3,3) to (3,4). (3,4) is A. So that's an apple. So moving UP in epoch 1, then RIGHT in epoch 2 would reach the apple in epoch 2. That's a shorter path.\n\nSo, which is better? Let's see:\n\nIf we move UP in epoch 1:\n\n- Epoch 1: head moves to (3,3). Safe.\n\nEpoch 2: direction can be RIGHT (since current direction is UP, so allowed). Move RIGHT → (3,4) which is A. Eat apple, score +1. That's great.\n\nYes, that's a better path. Because moving UP in epoch 1, then RIGHT in epoch 2 gets to the apple in two steps. Let's confirm the positions.\n\nCurrent head is (4,3). Moving UP (direction UP) → (3,3). That's row 3, column 3. Then, moving RIGHT (direction RIGHT) from (3,3) → (3,4). Which is the apple in row 3, column 4. Correct. So that's a valid path.\n\nSo, in epoch 1, moving UP is possible. Then, in epoch 2, moving RIGHT to get the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT in epoch 1:\n\nHead moves to (4,4). Then, in epoch 2, direction is RIGHT. Possible directions: RIGHT, UP, DOWN. If we move UP (direction UP), head moves from (4,4) to (3,4) (which is A). That's also possible. So both paths can reach the apple in epoch 2.\n\nBut what about other apples? There's another apple at (2,4) (row 2, column 4) and (5,2) (row 5, column 2). Let's see.\n\nThe apple at (5,2) is in row 5, column 2. The current head is (4,3). To reach (5,2), the snake would have to move DOWN (but current direction is UP, so can't reverse), then LEFT. But since current direction is UP, moving DOWN is not allowed in epoch 1. So that apple is harder to reach immediately.\n\nThe apples at (3,4) and (2,4) are in the same column (4), rows 3 and 2. So moving towards column 4 would help.\n\nSo, moving UP in epoch 1 (to (3,3)) allows the next move to RIGHT (to (3,4)) which is an apple. That's a good plan.\n\nIs there any danger in moving UP? Let's check if (3,3) is a valid position. The board's row 3 is \"#    A #\". So (3,3) is a space (columns 1: #, 2: space, 3: space, 4: A, 5: space, 6: #). So (3,3) is safe. No collision.\n\nSo the best direction in epoch 1 is UP, because it allows the next move to reach an apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT is also possible, but moving UP is more direct.\n\nWait, but let's make sure that moving UP is allowed. The current direction is UP, so moving UP again is allowed (since you can continue in the same direction). The snake can't reverse, but moving in the same direction is fine.\n\nYes. So the answer is UP. Because moving UP now is safe, and positions the snake to reach the apple in the next move.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (4, 3) (row 4, column 3), and it is currently moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid), leaving UP, LEFT, or RIGHT as possible moves. \n\n### Analysis of possible moves:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3, 3). This position is empty (no wall or self-collision), so it is safe. After moving UP, the snake's new head is at (3, 3), and the previous head position (4, 3) becomes part of the body ('S'). In the next epoch, the snake can then move RIGHT to (3, 4), which contains an apple ('A'), allowing it to eat the apple and grow.\n\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (4, 2). This position is empty and safe, but it does not directly position the snake to reach an apple quickly. The nearest apple in this direction is at (5, 2), which would require additional moves (DOWN, then LEFT), but DOWN is initially invalid (reverse of UP).\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4, 4). This position is empty and safe. In the next epoch, the snake could move UP to (3, 4) (an apple), but this path is less direct than moving UP first.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is optimal because it positions the snake to reach an apple at (3, 4) in the next epoch with a simple RIGHT move, maximizing the chance to eat an apple and grow.\n\nAnswer: UP",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, let's start by understanding the current game board. The user provided the game board, so I should first repeat that. Let me write down the current board:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the epoch is 1. The snake starts moving in the UP direction. The snake's head is 'H' at position (4,3) if we consider rows starting from 0 at the top. Wait, rows in grids are usually top to bottom. Let's map the coordinates properly. Let's index rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7). Each row has 8 characters.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #A A   # (columns 1: A, 3: A, rest spaces)\nRow 2: #     A# (column 6: A)\nRow 3: #      # (all spaces)\nRow 4: #  H   # (column 3: H)\nRow 5: #      # (spaces)\nRow 6: #      # (spaces)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the head H is in row 4, column 3. The current direction is UP. So moving UP means the head would move to row 3, column 3 (since moving up decreases the row number). Let's check what's there. Row 3, column 3: looking at row 3, which is \"#      #\", so column 3 is a space. So if the snake moves UP (current direction), the next position is (3,3), which is empty. Then the snake's body would follow. But since the snake is length 1, moving up would just update the head to (3,3), and the previous position (4,3) becomes empty.\n\nBut wait, the player can change direction, but cannot reverse. The current direction is UP. The possible directions the player can choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is the reverse of UP, which is not allowed). So possible directions are UP (continue), LEFT (turn left from UP, which would be left direction, i.e., column decreases by 1), RIGHT (turn right from UP, column increases by 1).\n\nLet's check the next positions for each possible direction:\n\nCurrent direction is UP. So possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't go DOWN, which is reverse).\n\n1. Direction UP: next head position is (3,3). What's in (3,3)? Row 3 is \"#      #\", so (3,3) is space. Safe, no collision. No apple here. So snake moves to (3,3), no growth.\n\n2. Direction LEFT: moving left from current head (4,3). Left direction is column 2. So new head position is (4,2). Let's check (4,2) in row 4: \"#  H   #\". So row 4 is columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: H, 4: space, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So (4,2) is space. So moving left would take head to (4,2). No collision, no apple here. Safe.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT: moving right from (4,3) is column 4. So new head position (4,4). Row 4, column 4 is space. Safe, no apple.\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's look where the apples are. The apples are in the board:\n\nRow 1: columns 1 (A), 3 (A)\nRow 2: column 6 (A)\n\nSo positions (1,1), (1,3), (2,6) are apples.\n\nThe current head is at (4,3). Let's see the path to the apples.\n\nIf the snake continues moving UP (current direction), next head is (3,3). Then, moving UP again would take it to (2,3). Let's check (2,3): row 2 is \"#     A#\". So row 2, column 3 is space. Then next UP would be (1,3) which is an apple! Because row 1, column 3 is A. So if the snake keeps moving UP, in two steps (epoch 1: move to (3,3), epoch 2: move to (2,3), epoch 3: move to (1,3) which is A), it can eat that apple.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake turns LEFT now (epoch 1), moving to (4,2). Then possible directions from there. But (4,2) is space. Then next move could be UP (since current direction would be LEFT, so can't reverse to RIGHT. So possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN (since direction is LEFT, reverse is RIGHT, so allowed directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN). But maybe not as useful. The apple at (1,3) is directly above. So moving UP is the shortest path to that apple.\n\nIf the snake moves UP now (epoch 1), head goes to (3,3). Then epoch 2, direction can still be UP (since no reversal), moving to (2,3). Then epoch 3, direction UP to (1,3), which is the apple. That's three steps. That's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves RIGHT now (epoch 1), head to (4,4). Then next moves? Let's see. The apple at (2,6) is in row 2, column 6. So from (4,4), moving RIGHT would go to (4,5), then (4,6), then (3,6), (2,6) (apple). That's more steps. So the closest apple is (1,3), which is three steps up.\n\nSo the best move is to continue in the current direction (UP), to reach the apple in the next steps. So the direction to choose is UP.\n\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at row 4, column 3 (0-indexed from top).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake is moving upward).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,1), (1,3), and (2,6).\n- **Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot go DOWN from UP).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP (Current Direction)**: Moving UP would take the head to row 3, column 3 (empty space). This is safe (no collision with walls or self). Continuing UP in subsequent steps would lead the head to row 2, column 3 (empty), then row 1, column 3 (apple at (1,3)). This is the shortest path to an apple (3 steps).\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to row 4, column 2 (empty space). This avoids collision but does not lead toward any apple quickly.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to row 4, column 4 (empty space). This also avoids collision but requires more steps to reach the nearest apple (at (2,6)).\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nContinuing in the current direction (UP) is the best strategy, as it aligns the snake with the closest apple at (1,3) in the fewest steps.\n\nAnswer: UP",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

First, I need to understand the current game state. The board is 8x8, with walls around. The snake's head is 'H', and since the current length is 1 (starts with length 1), there's no 'S' body parts yet. The current direction is UP, and the epoch is 1, so we're at the first move.\n\nLet me first visualize the game board. The user provided the board as:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nSo row 0 is the top (all #), row 7 is the bottom. Let's list the rows with their indexes:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      #\nRow 2: #      #\nRow 3: #      #\nRow 4: #  H   # (H is at row 4, column 3? Let's check. The row is \"#  H   #\", so positions 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is space, 3 is H, 4 is space, 5 is space, 6 is space, 7 is #. So H is at (4,3) (row 4, column 3).\nRow 5: #AA    # (columns 1 and 2 are A, so positions (5,1) and (5,2) are A)\nRow 6: #A     # (column 1 is A, position (6,1))\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. The next move would be in the current direction unless we change it, but we can only change to a direction that's not the reverse. The current direction is UP; the reverse would be DOWN. So possible directions to choose are UP (keep current), LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse and not allowed).\n\nWait, the rules say the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is UP, the snake can't immediately go DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, we need to decide which direction to move to eat apples and avoid collision.\n\nFirst, let's see where the snake's head is now: (4,3). Let's see where moving in each possible direction would take it.\n\nCurrent direction is UP. So moving UP from (4,3) would take the head to (3,3). Let's check that position. Row 3 is \"#      #\", so (3,3) is a space. So no collision. Then, if we choose UP, the head moves to (3,3). Since there's no apple there (row 3, column 3 is empty), the snake doesn't grow. The body (since length is 1) would now be at (4,3) as the body 'S'? Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (which is the previous head) is removed. But since the initial length is 1, moving without eating an apple would mean the head moves, and there's no body. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the snake starts with length 1 (only head). When it moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the length remains 1, so the previous position is no longer part of the snake. If it eats an apple, the length increases by 1, so the previous head becomes part of the body (S), and the new head is at the new position.\n\nSo, let's consider each possible direction:\n\n1. Direction UP: Next head position is (3,3). Check if that's a wall or body. (3,3) is in row 3, which is within the board (rows 1-6 are inside, since 0 and 7 are walls). So (3,3) is safe (no wall, no body, since the snake is length 1). No apple there, so the snake doesn't grow. The new board would have H at (3,3), and the previous position (4,3) is now empty.\n\n2. Direction LEFT: The current direction is UP, so LEFT is allowed (not reverse). Moving LEFT from (4,3) would take the head to (4,2). Let's check (4,2). The current row 4 is \"#  H   #\", so (4,2) is a space (since H is at 3). So (4,2) is empty. Is there an apple there? Let's check other rows. The apples are in row 5 (columns 1 and 2), row 6 (column 1). So (4,2) is not an apple. So moving LEFT would take the head to (4,2), which is safe, but no apple.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT: Current direction is UP, so RIGHT is allowed. Moving RIGHT from (4,3) takes the head to (4,4). Check (4,4): row 4, column 4 is a space. No apple there. So safe, no apple.\n\n4. Direction DOWN: Reverse of UP, so not allowed. So can't choose DOWN.\n\nNow, the snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's look at where the apples are. The apples are at (5,1), (5,2), (6,1). The head is at (4,3). Let's see the positions of apples relative to the head.\n\nIf the snake moves UP (to (3,3)), then next move possibilities. But maybe we can plan ahead. Alternatively, perhaps moving DOWN (but that's reverse, not allowed). Wait, the current direction is UP. So the next direction can't be DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving DOWN is not allowed, so the snake must choose between UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, but perhaps moving in a direction that will lead towards the apples. Let's see. The apples are in row 5 and 6 (below the head's current row 4). The head is at (4,3). The apples are at (5,1), (5,2), (6,1). So they are to the south (down) and west (left) of the head.\n\nIf the snake is currently moving UP (north), but perhaps changing direction to LEFT or DOWN (but DOWN is reverse) to get to the apples.\n\nWait, but current direction is UP. The next move's direction can be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. So if we choose to go LEFT, the head moves to (4,2). Let's check (4,2): that's in row 4, column 2. Then, the next possible directions would be LEFT (reverse of RIGHT, but current direction would be LEFT, so next direction can't be RIGHT). Wait, the direction after moving LEFT would be LEFT, so the next direction can't be RIGHT. But perhaps that's getting ahead.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if any of the possible directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) would lead to an apple in the next move.\n\nCurrent head position (4,3). Let's check the adjacent cells:\n\n- UP (row 3, column 3): empty.\n- DOWN (row 5, column 3): let's check row 5. Row 5 is \"#AA    #\", so columns 1 and 2 are A, column 3 is space. So (5,3) is empty. So if the snake could move DOWN (but it can't, since current direction is UP, and DOWN is reverse). So moving DOWN is invalid.\n- LEFT (row 4, column 2): (4,2) is empty (row 4 is \"#  H   #\", so columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: H, etc. So (4,2) is space. So no apple.\n- RIGHT (row 4, column 4): (4,4) is space. No apple.\n\nSo none of the immediate next moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) would hit an apple. But perhaps moving in a direction that would allow the snake to reach the apples in the following moves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best option is to move DOWN. But wait, the current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction, so moving DOWN is not allowed. Because reversing direction (UP to DOWN) is prohibited. So that's invalid. So the allowed directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nHmm. So which of these directions would be better? Let's think about the snake's path. The apples are in row 5 (columns 1 and 2) and row 6 (column 1). The head is at (4,3). To reach those apples, the snake would need to move down (south) and left (west).\n\nIf the snake continues moving UP (north), it will go towards row 3, 2, 1, which are empty. That might take it away from the apples.\n\nIf the snake turns LEFT (west), moving to (4,2). Then, the next direction could be LEFT again (since current direction would be LEFT, so can't reverse to RIGHT), or UP, DOWN. Let's say after moving LEFT to (4,2), the next direction could be DOWN (since current direction is LEFT, and DOWN is not reverse of LEFT). So from (4,2), moving DOWN would take it to (5,2), which is an apple (since row 5, column 2 is A). That would be good. So if we move LEFT now, then next move we can go DOWN to eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we move UP now (to (3,3)), then the next direction could be DOWN (since current direction would be UP, so next direction can't be UP's reverse (DOWN) again? Wait, no: the current direction after moving UP would be UP. So the next direction can't be DOWN. So if we go UP, next direction can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Then, perhaps moving DOWN is not allowed. So that path might not lead to the apples as quickly.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT. Let's see: moving RIGHT to (4,4). Then next direction could be RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. But that's moving east, away from the apples which are west and south. So that's probably not good.\n\nSo the best option is to turn LEFT. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent move: direction LEFT. The head moves from (4,3) to (4,2). Since there's no apple there, the snake's length remains 1. The new head is at (4,2). The previous head position (4,3) is now empty (since length 1, no body).\n\nThen, next epoch (epoch 2), the current direction would be LEFT. So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN (since reverse is RIGHT). Then, moving DOWN (from (4,2) to (5,2)) which is an apple. That would allow the snake to eat the apple, increase the score, and grow.\n\nSo choosing LEFT now would set up the next move to reach an apple.\n\nTherefore, the best direction to choose now is LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (row 4, column 3).\n- Apples ('A') are at (5,1), (5,2), and (6,1).\n- Current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Allowed directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (3,3). This cell is empty (no apple), and the snake moves away from the apples (located south of the head). This is not ideal.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (4,4). This cell is empty, and the snake moves east, further from the apples (which are west and south). Not optimal.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (4,2). This cell is empty, but it positions the snake closer to the apples (e.g., (5,2) is directly south of (4,2)). In the next move (with direction LEFT), the snake can then move DOWN (allowed, as LEFT and DOWN are not reverses) to (5,2), which contains an apple. This sets up a path to eat an apple in the following epoch.\n\nThus, choosing LEFT is the best option to position the snake for future apple consumption.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, let's look at the current game board. The user provided the board, so I should start by repeating that. \n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, and the current epoch is 2. The snake starts moving in UP, but now it's moving LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction, so since current direction is LEFT, the snake can't go RIGHT (because that's the opposite). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since LEFT is current, but moving in the same direction is allowed). Wait, the rules say the player provides direction inputs, and the snake can't reverse. So if current direction is LEFT, the possible next directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing would be RIGHT, which is not allowed).\n\nThe snake's head is at position (row 4, column 2) assuming rows are 0-based from top. Let's check the coordinates. The board is 8x8. Let's index rows from top as 0 to 7. So row 0 is the top wall (all #), row 1 is next, etc. \n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7)\nRow 1: #      # → columns 1-6 are empty (since 0 and 7 are #)\nRow 2: #      # → same\nRow 3: #      # → same\nRow 4: # H    # → so H is at (4, 2) (since column 1 is #, column 2 is H, then columns 3-6 are empty, column 7 is #)\nRow 5: #AA    # → A's at (5, 2) and (5, 3)\nRow 6: #A     # → A at (6, 2)\nRow 7: ########\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,2). Current direction is LEFT. So moving LEFT would take the head to (4,1). Let's check what's there. The row 4 is \"# H    #\", so column 1 is a space (since after the # (column 0) comes a space (column 1), then H at column 2). So (4,1) is empty. So moving LEFT would be possible, but is there an apple there? No. \n\nIf the snake moves UP: current direction is LEFT, so UP is allowed (not reversing). Moving UP from (4,2) would take it to (3,2). Let's check row 3: \"#      #\", so (3,2) is empty. No apple there.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN: direction is allowed (not reversing). Moving DOWN from (4,2) to (5,2). What's in (5,2)? The row 5 is \"#AA    #\", so (5,2) is A. Oh, that's an apple! So if the snake moves DOWN, the head will go to (5,2), which is an apple. Eating that apple would make the snake grow, and the score increases by 1. \n\nSo moving DOWN would result in eating an apple. That's good. Let's confirm. Current head is (4,2). Moving DOWN: new head position (5,2). The current cell (5,2) is A. So the snake eats the apple. Then, since the snake grows, the previous head position (4,2) becomes part of the body (S). The new head is (5,2) as H. The other apples would remain except the one eaten. Let's check the example given. In the example, when moving DOWN, the head moves to where an A was, and the previous head becomes S. So yes, moving DOWN here would eat the apple at (5,2). \n\nWhat about the other options? Moving LEFT would take the head to (4,1), which is safe (no collision with walls or self). The snake is length 1, so no body yet, so no self-collision. But no apple there, so no growth. Moving UP to (3,2) is also safe, but no apple. So the best move is DOWN, to eat the apple. That's the optimal choice here.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT, and it can choose to move UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed). The snake's head is at position (row 4, column 2). \n\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (4, 1), which is empty (no apple).\n- Moving UP would take the head to (3, 2), which is empty (no apple).\n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (5, 2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple would increase the score by 1 and allow the snake to grow.\n\nThe optimal choice is to move DOWN to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (empty)\nRow 2: #      # (empty)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: # S A  # (so positions (4,2) is 'S', (4,4) is 'A')\nRow 5: #AH    # (here, (5,1) is 'A', (5,2) is 'H' since 'H' is the head)\nRow 6: #A     # (so (6,1) is 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. The snake's head is at (5,2) (since row 5 is the fifth row, starting from 0). Let's confirm coordinates: rows are 0-7, columns 0-7. So (row, column) for each cell. For row 5, the string is \"#AH    #\", so column 0 is '#', column 1 is 'A', column 2 is 'H', columns 3-6 are spaces, column 7 is '#'. So head position (H) is (5,2).\n\nThe snake's body: in row 4, the string is \"# S A  #\". So column 0 is '#', column 1 is space, column 2 is 'S', column 3 is space, column 4 is 'A', columns 5-6 are spaces, column 7 is '#'. So body (S) is at (4,2). Since the snake starts with length 1, but now has a body, that means the snake has already eaten an apple. Because each time it eats an apple, it grows. So initial length 1 (only H), after eating one apple, length 2 (H and S). So the current snake's body is (4,2), and head is (5,2). So the snake is moving down (current direction is DOWN), which makes sense because the head is below the body. So the previous move was down from (4,2) to (5,2), which was the head moving down. But wait, how did the body get to (4,2)? Let's think: the snake's movement is such that when it moves, the head moves forward, and each body segment follows the previous one. So if the snake was moving down, the head was at (4,2) (H), then moved down to (5,2) (H), and the previous head position becomes S (body). But in row 5, we have AH, so (5,1) is A, (5,2) is H. So maybe the previous positions were: before the current move, the head was at (4,2), and then moved down to (5,2), and the body is at (4,2). That's correct.\n\nNow, the current direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. The next move direction must not be the reverse. The reverse of DOWN is UP, so the snake can't go UP. The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since current direction is DOWN, and you can't reverse, so UP is invalid).\n\nWe need to choose the direction that allows the snake to eat an apple, avoid walls and self-collision, and maximize the score. Let's check where the head will move next based on each possible direction.\n\nCurrent head position is (5,2). Let's compute next positions for each possible direction:\n\n1. Direction DOWN: next head position is (6,2). Let's check row 6. Row 6 is \"#A     #\". So column 0 is '#', column 1 is 'A', columns 2-6 are spaces, column 7 is '#'. So (6,2) is a space. So moving down to (6,2) would be valid (not a wall, not a body). The body would then move to (5,2), and the previous body (4,2) would stay? Wait, no. When the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (last body segment) moves forward. So the snake's length remains the same. If it does eat an apple, the length increases, so the tail doesn't move (the body grows by one). Let's think: the current snake has length 2 (H at (5,2), S at (4,2)). If it moves in a direction and doesn't eat an apple, the new head is at (new_row, new_col), and the body becomes (5,2), and the previous S (4,2) is removed (since length stays 2). If it eats an apple, the length becomes 3, so the body would be (5,2) and (4,2), and the new head is the new position.\n\nSo, let's check possible directions:\n\nPossible directions (can't go UP, since current direction is DOWN, reverse is not allowed). So options: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nCheck each:\n\nOption 1: Direction DOWN. Next head position (6,2). Let's check (6,2): row 6, column 2. Row 6 is \"#A     #\", so column 2 is ' ' (space). So that's empty. No collision. So the snake moves there. Since there's no apple there, the snake's body would update. The new body would be (5,2) (previous head), and the previous body (4,2) would be removed (since length remains 2). So the new board would have H at (6,2), S at (5,2), and (4,2) becomes empty. No apple eaten, score remains same.\n\nOption 2: Direction LEFT. Next head position (5,1). Let's check (5,1): row 5 is \"#AH    #\", column 1 is 'A'. So that's an apple. So if the snake moves LEFT to (5,1), it eats the apple. Then the snake grows by 1 (length becomes 3). The body segments would be (5,2) (previous head) and (4,2) (previous body). So the new head is (5,1), body at (5,2) and (4,2). So the board would have H at (5,1), S at (5,2) and (4,2), and the apple at (5,1) is removed. That's good because eating the apple increases the score. Also, (5,1) is not a wall (row 5, column 1: the row is \"#AH...\", so column 0 is '#', column 1 is 'A', column 2 is 'H' etc. So (5,1) is within the board (columns 1-6 are valid, since column 0 and 7 are walls). So moving LEFT to (5,1) is valid, no collision. The direction change from DOWN to LEFT is allowed (since LEFT is not the reverse of DOWN; reverse of DOWN is UP). So this is a valid move.\n\nOption 3: Direction RIGHT. Next head position (5,3). Let's check (5,3). Row 5 is \"#AH    #\", columns 0-7: 0='#',1='A',2='H',3=' ',4=' ',5=' ',6=' ',7='#'. So (5,3) is space. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (5,3). No apple there, so snake moves, body becomes (5,2), previous body (4,2) is removed. No score increase.\n\nNow, which direction is best? The goal is to eat apples. So moving LEFT would eat the apple at (5,1). That's a good move. Let's confirm that (5,1) is not a body part. The current body is at (4,2). So (5,1) is empty except for the apple, so no collision. The direction change from DOWN to LEFT is allowed (reverse of DOWN is UP, so LEFT is allowed). So moving LEFT would result in eating the apple, increasing the score, and growing the snake. That's better than moving DOWN or RIGHT, which don't eat apples.\n\nAre there any other considerations? For example, after moving LEFT, the next positions. But since the current epoch is 3, and the game ends at 100, we can focus on the immediate next move. The best move here is to go LEFT and eat the apple.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S A  #\n#AH    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (5,2) (row 5, column 2).\n- The snake's body ('S') is at (4,2) (row 4, column 2).\n- Current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP.\n- Apples ('A') are at (4,4), (5,1), and (6,1).\n\n### Possible directions and outcomes:\n1. **DOWN**: Next head position is (6,2). This cell is empty (no apple). The snake moves without eating, no score increase.\n2. **RIGHT**: Next head position is (5,3). This cell is empty (no apple). The snake moves without eating, no score increase.\n3. **LEFT**: Next head position is (5,1). This cell contains an apple ('A'). Moving LEFT here allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake. No collision with walls or self occurs (the body is at (4,2), and (5,1) is valid).\n\nThe optimal move is to go LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S A  #\n#HS    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, and the current epoch is 4. The snake starts moving in UP, but now it's moving LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction, so from LEFT, the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing would be RIGHT, which is not allowed). Wait, no, the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. Because reversing (opposite) is not allowed. So the possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, let's find the snake's position. The head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. Let's look at the board. Let's index the rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7). Columns from left (column 0) to right (column 7).\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #   A  # → columns 1-6: '   A  ' → positions (1,3) is A\nRow 2: #      # → all empty except walls\nRow 3: #      # → same\nRow 4: # S A  # → columns 1-6: ' S A  ' → (4,2) is S, (4,4) is A\nRow 5: #HS    # → columns 1-6: 'HS    ' → (5,1) is H, (5,2) is S\nRow 6: #A     # → (6,1) is A\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the snake's head is at (5,1). The body is at (5,2) and (4,2) (since row 4, column 2 is S, and row 5, column 2 is S as well). Let's confirm the snake's body segments. The snake's length is 3, since there's H (1) plus two S's (2), total 3. Because when the snake eats an apple, it grows. The initial length is 1 (just H). So each apple increases length by 1. Let's check the initial setup. The example says the snake starts with length 1 (H), and each apple eaten increases length. So current snake length is 3, which implies the snake has eaten 2 apples already. Because 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nNow, the current direction is LEFT. So the snake is moving left. The head is at (5,1). If the snake continues moving LEFT, the next position of the head would be (5,0), which is a wall (since row 5, column 0 is part of the wall '#'). So moving LEFT would cause a collision with the wall, ending the game. So that's bad.\n\nSo LEFT is not an option. So we need to consider UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check UP. Current head is (5,1). Moving UP would take it to (4,1). Let's check what's in (4,1). The row 4 is \"# S A  #\", so columns 1 is space (since columns 0 is #, column 1 is ' ', column 2 is S, column 3 is space, column 4 is A, column 5 is space, column 6 is space, column 7 is #). So (4,1) is empty. So the new head position would be (4,1). Then, the body segments would shift. Since the snake is moving, the tail (the last segment) would stay if it ate an apple, but if not, the tail moves forward. Wait, the movement works as: when the snake moves, the head moves to the new direction, and each body segment follows the previous one. If the head moves to an apple, the snake grows (so the tail doesn't move, adding a new segment). Otherwise, the tail is removed (so the length remains the same).\n\nCurrent length is 3. Let's see the current body positions. The head is H at (5,1). The body S's are at (5,2) and (4,2). So the snake's body is H (5,1) → S (5,2) → S (4,2). So the order is head first, then body segments. So when moving, the next head position is (new_row, new_col), then each body part takes the position of the previous one.\n\nIf we move UP: new head is (4,1). Then, the next body segment (first S) moves to (5,1) (previous head position), and the next S (second S) moves to (5,2) (previous first S position). The tail (the last S) would stay only if the head ate an apple. Otherwise, the tail is removed. Wait, no. The snake's movement is: when moving, the head moves forward. If the head moves into an apple, the snake's length increases by 1 (so all body segments stay, and the head adds a new position). If not, the snake's length remains the same, so the tail (last body segment) is removed, and the other body segments follow the head.\n\nSo in current state, the snake's body is H (5,1), S (5,2), S (4,2). The length is 3. Let's check if moving UP would hit any body part or wall.\n\nMoving UP to (4,1): (4,1) is empty (no S or wall). So that's safe. Then, after moving, the new body positions would be:\n\nHead at (4,1), then S at (5,1), then S at (5,2). The previous tail was (4,2). Since the head didn't eat an apple (because (4,1) is empty), the tail (4,2) is removed. So the new body would be H (4,1), S (5,1), S (5,2). That's length 3. No collision.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN? The current head is (5,1). Moving DOWN would take it to (6,1). Let's check (6,1). Row 6 is \"#A     #\", so column 1 is A (apple). Oh, that's an apple! So if we move DOWN, the head moves to (6,1), which is an apple. So the snake eats the apple, score increases by 1, and the snake grows by 1. So the length becomes 4. Let's check if (6,1) is safe. (6,1) is within the board (row 6, column 1: row 0-7, column 0-7; the walls are at 0 and 7, so row 6 is within 1-6 (since row 7 is a wall). So (6,1) is inside the board, not a wall. Also, check if it's a body part. The current body is at (5,2) and (4,2). (6,1) is not a body part, so no collision. So moving DOWN would be safe, and the snake eats an apple. That's good.\n\nSo let's summarize:\n\nPossible directions (can't reverse LEFT to RIGHT, so options are UP, DOWN, LEFT). But LEFT is wall → death. UP is safe but no apple. DOWN is safe and gets an apple. So the best choice is DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S A  #\n#HS    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5,1) (row 5, column 1), with body segments at (5,2) and (4,2). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. The possible directions to move are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (5,0), which is a wall. This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (4,1), an empty space. No collision occurs, but no apple is eaten.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (6,1), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision) and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing the snake.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board.\n\nThe board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #   A  # (so positions (1,3) is 'A')\nRow 2: #      # (empty)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: # S A A# (so positions (4,2) is 'S', (4,4) 'A', (4,5) 'A')\nRow 5: #SS    # (positions (5,1) 'S', (5,2) 'S')\nRow 6: #H     # (position (6,1) is 'H' (head))\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. The snake's head is at (6,1). Since the current direction is DOWN, the next position if we keep moving DOWN would be (7,1). But row 7 is the bottom wall (all '#'), so moving DOWN would cause a collision with the wall. That's bad because the game ends if the snake hits the wall.\n\nSo we can't go DOWN. The snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is DOWN, so reversing would be UP. Wait, no. The rule says the snake cannot reverse direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly). So if current direction is DOWN, the opposite is UP. So can we turn UP? Let's check: the previous direction was DOWN, so the next direction can't be UP (since that's reversing). Wait, no, the example says when moving UP, you can't go to DOWN. So the forbidden direction is the opposite. So current direction is DOWN, so the snake can't turn to UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (but DOWN is into the wall). So options are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check where the head is now. Head is at (6,1). Let's get coordinates right: rows are 0-7 (top to bottom), columns 0-7 (left to right). So (row, column). So row 6, column 1 is the head's position.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So next position if moving DOWN would be row 7, column 1. But row 7 is the bottom wall (all '#'), so that's a collision. So we must change direction to LEFT or RIGHT, since UP is the reverse and not allowed.\n\nLet's check possible directions:\n\nOption 1: LEFT. So direction is LEFT. The head would move to (6,0). Column 0 is a wall (since the first character of each row is '#'), so (6,0) is a wall. So moving LEFT would hit the wall. That's bad.\n\nOption 2: RIGHT. Direction is RIGHT. The head moves to (6,2). Let's check what's at (6,2). The row 6 is \"#H     #\", so positions are: 0: '#', 1: 'H', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (6,2) is empty. So moving RIGHT would be safe.\n\nNow, let's check the snake's body to avoid collision. The snake's body is made of 'S' cells. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 5: #SS    # → columns 1 and 2: (5,1), (5,2)\nRow 4: # S A A# → column 2: (4,2)\nSo the body segments are at (5,1), (5,2), (4,2). \n\nIf we move RIGHT, the new head position is (6,2). Let's check if (6,2) is part of the body. The body positions are (5,1), (5,2), (4,2). (6,2) is not in those, so no collision. Good.\n\nNow, after moving RIGHT, what's the next state? The snake's head moves to (6,2). Since there's no apple there (row 6, column 2 is ' '), the snake doesn't grow. So the body would shift. The current body is a chain. The snake's length is the number of 'S' plus 1 (head). Let's count: 'S' in row 5 (two), row 4 (one) → 3 'S's. So current length is 4 (head + 3 body). When moving, the tail (the last 'S') would be removed unless an apple is eaten. Since we didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last 'S') is removed. Let's track the body movement. The current direction was DOWN, so the previous positions would be:\n\nThe head was moving down. Let's think about the snake's path. Let's assume the snake's body is in order. The head is at (6,1). The next segment (body) would be where the head was before. Let's see, the current body positions: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2). So perhaps the snake's movement history:\n\nCurrent head (H) is at (6,1). Before that, the head was at (5,1) (since (5,1) is 'S' now). Then before that, head was at (5,2) (since (5,2) is 'S'), then (4,2) (another 'S'). So the body is (5,1), (5,2), (4,2). So when moving RIGHT to (6,2), the new head is (6,2). The body would follow: the new body segments are (6,1) (old head), (5,1), (5,2). The tail (4,2) would be removed (since no apple was eaten). So the new body positions would be (6,1), (5,1), (5,2). Let's check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, the snake's body is a sequence. Each time it moves, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the order is H → body1 → body2 → body3. So if the head was at (6,1), body1 is (5,1), body2 is (5,2), body3 is (4,2). When moving right to (6,2), the new head is (6,2). Then body1 moves to (6,1) (old head), body2 moves to (5,1) (old body1), body3 moves to (5,2) (old body2). The tail (old body3, (4,2)) is removed because no apple was eaten. So the new body positions are (6,1), (5,1), (5,2). So the new board would have 'H' at (6,2), 'S's at (6,1), (5,1), (5,2). Let's check if that's correct.\n\nSo moving RIGHT is safe. What about other options? Let's recap:\n\n- DOWN: (7,1) → wall → game over. Can't do.\n- UP: reverse direction (current direction is DOWN; reverse is UP) → not allowed. So can't choose UP.\n- LEFT: (6,0) → wall → game over. Can't do.\n- RIGHT: (6,2) → safe, no collision.\n\nSo the only safe direction is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S A A#\n#SS    #\n#H     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6,1) (row 6, column 1) and is currently moving DOWN. The next move must avoid walls, self-collision, and cannot reverse direction (UP is the reverse of DOWN and is invalid). \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,1), which is a wall (row 7 is the bottom wall). This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **UP**: Reversing direction (from DOWN to UP) is not allowed per the rules.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (6,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall). This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6,2). This position is empty (no walls or snake body segments), so it is safe.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, let's start by understanding the current game board and the snake's position.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls (#). Let's parse the current board row by row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #   A  # → positions (1,3) is A (since rows start at 0, columns 0-7)\nRow 2: #      # → all empty\nRow 3: #      # → all empty\nRow 4: #   A A# → positions (4,3) and (4,5) are A\nRow 5: #SS    # → positions (5,1) and (5,2) are S (body)\nRow 6: #SH    # → positions (6,1) is S (body), (6,2) is H (head)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right. Let's confirm the snake's body positions. The head is at (6,2). The body: looking at row 6, it's SH, so (6,1) is S. Then row 5 has SS, so (5,1) and (5,2) are S. So the snake's body is in a vertical line? Let's list all the snake's segments in order. Since the snake moves, the head is the front. When moving, the body follows. Let's think: the current direction is RIGHT, so the head was moving right. Let's track the movement.\n\nThe current head is at (6,2). The previous position of the head before the last move would be (6,1), which is now S (since the body follows). Then the next body part is (5,1), and (5,2)? Wait, let's reconstruct the snake's path. The snake's body is made of S's, and the head is H. The snake's length is the number of S's plus 1 (H). Let's count S's: row 5 has two S's (columns 1 and 2), row 6 has one S (column 1). So total S's: 3. So snake length is 4 (3 S + 1 H).\n\nThe snake's segments (from head to tail) would be: H at (6,2), then S at (6,1) (the immediate body), then S at (5,1), then S at (5,2). Wait, maybe. Because when the snake moves, each body part follows the one in front. Let's think of the movement direction. The current direction is RIGHT. So the head was moving right. Let's say the previous positions:\n\nIf the current head is (6,2), then the previous head position (before moving right) was (6,1). Then, the body segments would be (6,1) → (5,1) → (5,2). Because when the snake moves right, the head goes from (6,1) to (6,2). The body part that was at (6,1) moves to where the head was, but wait, no. The snake's body is a chain. Let's think of the snake's body as a list. The head is first. Then each next segment is the previous position of the segment before it. So if the snake is moving right, the head's new position is (6,2). The previous head position was (6,1), which is now the first body segment. The next body segment was the position before that, which could be (5,1), then (5,2). So the body is (6,1) → (5,1) → (5,2). So the snake's segments are H at (6,2), then S at (6,1), S at (5,1), S at (5,2). So the tail is at (5,2).\n\nNow, the snake's next move. The current direction is RIGHT, and the player can choose a new direction, but cannot reverse. So the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since reversing would be LEFT, which is opposite of RIGHT). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nWe need to check each possible direction to see if moving in that direction would cause a collision (with walls or self) and if it would eat an apple.\n\nLet's list the head's current position: (6,2) (row 6, column 2). Let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. RIGHT: Next position is (6,3). Let's check what's there. Looking at row 6: #SH    #. So columns 0 is #, 1 is S, 2 is H, 3 is space (since the row is #SH    # → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:H, 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #). So (6,3) is empty. So moving right here would be safe. The new head is (6,3). Then, the body segments shift: the previous head (6,2) becomes S, the next body part (6,1) becomes S, (5,1) becomes S, (5,2) becomes S. Wait, but when the snake moves, the body follows. So the tail (5,2) would move to (5,1) if the snake grows? No, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Currently, there's no apple at (6,3), so the snake doesn't grow. So after moving right, the tail (5,2) would be removed (since the length remains the same). So the new body would be (6,2) (old head), (6,1), (5,1). The new head is (6,3). So the snake's new positions would be H at (6,3), S at (6,2), S at (6,1), S at (5,1). That's safe. No collision.\n\n2. UP: Next position is (5,2). Let's check (5,2). Row 5 is #SS    # → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3: ' ', etc. So (5,2) is S (body). So moving UP would cause the head to collide with the body. That's a game over. So UP is invalid.\n\n3. DOWN: Next position is (7,2). Row 7 is ######## (bottom wall). So (7,2) is a wall. Collision. Game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo the only safe directions are RIGHT. Because moving UP hits the body, moving DOWN hits the wall. So the player must choose RIGHT to avoid collision.\n\nAlso, let's check if there's an apple in the direction. The next position for RIGHT is (6,3), which is empty. So no apple eaten here. But the snake survives. So the correct direction is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A A#\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and collision risks:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head (H) is at (row 6, column 2). The body (S) segments are at (6,1), (5,1), and (5,2).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (5,2). This position is occupied by the snake's body (S), causing a self-collision. Game over. ❌\n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,2), which is a wall (#). Collision with the wall. Game over. ❌\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6,3). This position is empty (no walls or body segments). Safe move. ✅\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly moving RIGHT avoids collisions. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by parsing the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #   A  # (so columns 3 is 'A', others are empty except walls)\nRow 2: #      # (all empty except walls)\nRow 3: #      # (all empty except walls)\nRow 4: #   A A# (columns 3 and 5 are 'A')\nRow 5: #S     # (column 1 is 'S')\nRow 6: #SSH   # (columns 1, 2, 3 are 'S', 'S', 'H' respectively)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at row 6, column 3. The body 'S's are at (row 6, column 2), (row 6, column 1), and (row 5, column 1). Let's confirm the snake's body segments: the head is H at (6,3). Then, the next part is S at (6,2), then S at (6,1), then S at (5,1). So the snake's current body is a line from (5,1) up to (6,3). Because the snake moves in the current direction, which is RIGHT. So the head was moving right. Let's think about the movement direction.\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction, so it can't go LEFT immediately. So possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since reversing to LEFT is not allowed). Wait, the problem says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, wait. Wait, the example given is UP to DOWN or LEFT to RIGHT. Oh, maybe I misread. Let me check: \"cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly)\". Oh, that's the reverse. So if current direction is UP, the snake can't go DOWN (reverse). If current direction is LEFT, can't go RIGHT. So for current direction RIGHT, the snake can't go LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,3). Let's see where it would move next. Let's consider each possible direction:\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So if the player chooses to continue moving RIGHT (direction RIGHT), the head would move to (6,4). Let's check that position. The current row 6 is \"#SSH   #\", so columns 0 is #, 1:S, 2:S, 3:H, 4: (empty), 5: (empty), 6: (empty), 7: #. So (6,4) is empty. Is that a valid move? The walls are at column 7, so (6,4) is within the board (columns 0-7, so 4 is okay). So moving RIGHT would take the head to (6,4), which is empty. No collision with walls or self. So that's safe.\n\nIf the player chooses UP, the head would move to (5,3). Let's check row 5: \"#S     #\". Column 3 in row 5 is empty (since row 5 is #S     #, so columns 0: #, 1:S, 2: empty, 3: empty, 4: empty, 5: empty, 6: empty, 7: #). So (5,3) is empty. So moving UP would take the head there. Is that safe? The body is at (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So (5,3) is not part of the body. So safe.\n\nIf the player chooses DOWN, the head would move to (7,3). But row 7 is all walls (########), so column 3 is a wall. So moving DOWN would cause a collision with the wall. That's a game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, RIGHT. LEFT is invalid (reverse). DOWN is invalid (wall).\n\nNow, let's check if any of these directions lead to eating an apple. Let's look for apples on the board. The apples are in row 1 (column 3), row 4 (columns 3 and 5).\n\nCurrent head position (6,3). Let's see where each direction would take the head:\n\n- RIGHT: (6,4). Check if (6,4) has an apple. The current row 6 is \"#SSH   #\", so (6,4) is empty (no apple). So no apple here.\n\n- UP: (5,3). Check row 5: \"#S     #\", (5,3) is empty. No apple.\n\nSo neither direction leads to eating an apple in the next move. So the priority is to avoid collision and perhaps move towards apples.\n\nLet's think about the snake's path. The snake's body is (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). The current direction is RIGHT, so the next move if direction is RIGHT would be (6,4). Then, the body would follow. The snake's length is 4 (since H is 1, plus 3 S's: 1+3=4). When moving, the snake's body segments follow the head. So when the head moves to (6,4), the next body part would be (6,3), then (6,2), then (6,1), then (5,1). So the new body would be (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), and the head is (6,4). So that's safe.\n\nIf the direction is UP, moving to (5,3). The body would then be (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1). So the new body is (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), and head (5,3). That's also safe.\n\nNow, let's look at the positions of the apples. The apples are at (1,3), (4,3), (4,5). Let's see where the snake can go to reach them.\n\nThe current head is at (6,3). Let's see:\n\nApple at (4,3): that's two rows up (from row 6 to 4). If the snake moves up, then perhaps can reach there.\n\nApple at (4,5): to the right of (4,3). So the snake would need to go right, then up.\n\nApple at (1,3): further up.\n\nSo, if the snake moves UP, next position (5,3). Then maybe continue moving UP to (4,3), which is an apple. That's a good target. Let's check (4,3): row 4 is \"#   A A#\", so column 3 is 'A'. So (4,3) is an apple. So if the snake can move up to (5,3) (next move), then in the next epoch (epoch 8), if the direction is UP again (since current direction after moving UP would be UP, and can't reverse to DOWN), then the head would move to (4,3), which is an apple. That would be good, as it would eat the apple and grow.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake continues moving RIGHT, next position (6,4). Then, possible directions could be UP, RIGHT, or DOWN (but DOWN is wall). So moving RIGHT again to (6,5), then (6,6) (but row 6's columns 5 and 6 are empty). Then perhaps up towards the apples. But (4,5) is an apple, so if the snake moves right to (6,4), then (6,5), then (5,5), then (4,5) (apple). That's also a path, but perhaps the apple at (4,3) is closer.\n\nSo moving UP now would set the snake on a path to reach (4,3) in the next move. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent epoch 7. Next move (epoch 8) direction UP: head moves from (6,3) to (5,3). Then, epoch 9, direction UP again (since current direction would be UP), head moves from (5,3) to (4,3) (which is an apple). So in epoch 9, the snake would eat the apple, increasing the score. That's a good plan.\n\nIf the direction is RIGHT now, head moves to (6,4). Then, in epoch 8, direction could be UP. Then head moves to (5,4). Then epoch 9, direction UP to (4,4). Then epoch 10, direction RIGHT to (4,5) (apple). That's more steps. So the apple at (4,3) is closer if we move UP now.\n\nTherefore, the best direction to choose now is UP. Because moving UP now allows the snake to reach the apple at (4,3) in the next two moves (epoch 8 and 9), whereas moving RIGHT would take longer. Also, moving DOWN is invalid (wall), and LEFT is reverse direction (invalid). So the valid options are UP and RIGHT. Between them, UP is better to reach the nearest apple.\n\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A A#\n#S     #\n#SSH   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 6, column 3). The body ('S') segments are at (6,2), (6,1), and (5,1). The snake's current length is 4.\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT is invalid.\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,3), (4,3), and (4,5).\n- **Walls**: The board edges are walls ('#'). Moving into a wall causes a game over.\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,3), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). This causes an immediate collision. **Invalid**.\n2. **LEFT**: Reversing direction (current direction is RIGHT). The snake cannot reverse direction. **Invalid**.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6,4). This cell is empty (no collision with walls or self). Safe but does not reach an apple immediately.\n4. **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (5,3). This cell is empty (no collision with walls or self). Safe and positions the snake to reach the nearest apple at (4,3) in the next move.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe apple at (4,3) is the closest. Moving UP now positions the snake to reach (4,3) in the next epoch (epoch 8: head moves to (5,3); epoch 9: head moves to (4,3), eating the apple). This maximizes the score and avoids immediate risks.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #   A  # (so positions (1,3) is A)\nRow 2: #      # (empty)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #   A A# (positions (4,3) and (4,5) are A)\nRow 5: #  H   # (the head H is at (5,2))\nRow 6: #SSS   # (body S at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4))\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. The snake's head is at (5,2) (row 5, column 2, assuming rows are 0-7 from top to bottom, columns 0-7 from left to right). Since the current direction is UP, the next move (if we don't change direction) would be moving to row 4, column 2. Let's check that position.\n\nRow 4 is \"#   A A#\", so column 2 is a space (since the row is \"#   A A#\", which is: index 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is space, 3 is A, 4 is space, 5 is A, 6 is space, 7 is #). So (4,2) is a space. So if we keep moving UP, the head moves to (4,2). \n\nBut wait, the snake's body is in row 6: positions (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). The current head is (5,2). So the snake's body is behind it. Let's reconstruct the snake's body path. The head is at (5,2). The body starts at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). So the snake's movement history: the head was moving up, so previous positions would be (6,2) → (5,2). The body segments are (6,3) and (6,4), which are probably previous positions before that. So the snake's body is to the right and down from the head.\n\nNow, the possible directions we can choose are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But the snake cannot reverse direction. Since the current direction is UP, the reverse would be DOWN. So we can't choose DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. UP: The head moves to (4,2). Let's check if that's a wall or body. (4,2) is in row 4, column 2. The row 4 is \"#   A A#\", so column 2 is a space (since the structure is #, space, space, A, space, A, space, #). So (4,2) is empty. So moving UP here is safe. Also, check if there's an apple there. (4,2) is a space, no apple. So the snake moves up, the body follows. The new head is (4,2), and the body would be (5,2), (6,2), (6,3) (since the tail would stay if no apple is eaten. Wait, when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward. So the snake's length remains the same. So the current length is 4 (head + 3 body). So moving up, the new positions would be: head at (4,2), then (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). The tail (6,4) would be removed. So the body would be (5,2), (6,2), (6,3).\n\n2. LEFT: The snake is moving UP, and turning LEFT. The new direction is LEFT. So the head would move to (5,1). Let's check (5,1). The row 5 is \"#  H   #\", so the H is at (5,2). So (5,1) is a space (since row 5 is: #, space, space, H, space, space, space, #). So (5,1) is safe (not a wall, not body). The body is at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). So (5,1) is not in the body. So moving LEFT is possible. No apple there.\n\n3. RIGHT: The new direction is RIGHT. The head moves to (5,3). Let's check (5,3). The row 5 is \"#  H   #\", so (5,3) is the position of H? Wait, original row 5 is \"#  H   #\". Let's index columns 0-7. Column 0 is #, column 1 is space, column 2 is space, column 3 is H, column 4 is space, column 5 is space, column 6 is space, column 7 is #. Oh wait! Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck the positions. \n\nOriginal row 5: \"#  H   #\". Let's break it down:\n\n- Column 0: '#'\n- Column 1: ' '\n- Column 2: ' '\n- Column 3: 'H' (head)\n- Column 4: ' '\n- Column 5: ' '\n- Column 6: ' '\n- Column 7: '#'\n\nSo the head (H) is at (5,3) (row 5, column 3), not (5,2). Oh! That's a critical mistake. Let me correct that.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 is \"#SSS   #\". Let's parse that:\n\n- Column 0: '#'\n- Column 1: ' '\n- Column 2: 'S'\n- Column 3: 'S'\n- Column 4: 'S'\n- Column 5: ' '\n- Column 6: ' '\n- Column 7: '#'\n\nSo the body S's are at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\nRow 4: \"#   A A#\". Let's parse:\n\n- Column 0: '#'\n- Column 1: ' '\n- Column 2: ' '\n- Column 3: ' '\n- Column 4: 'A'\n- Column 5: 'A'\n- Column 6: ' '\n- Column 7: '#'\n\nSo apples in row 4 are at (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nRow 1: \"#   A  #\":\n\n- Column 0: '#'\n- Column 1: ' '\n- Column 2: ' '\n- Column 3: ' '\n- Column 4: 'A'\n- Column 5: ' '\n- Column 6: ' '\n- Column 7: '#'\n\nSo apple at (1,4).\n\nSo the head (H) is at (5,3). Current direction is UP, so moving UP would take the head to (4,3). Let's check (4,3): row 4, column 3. Row 4 is \"#   A A#\", column 3 is a space (since row 4's columns 0-7 are #, space, space, space, A, A, space, #). So (4,3) is space. No apple there. So moving UP to (4,3) is safe.\n\nNow, let's check the possible directions again with the corrected positions.\n\nCurrent head position: (5,3).\n\nCurrent direction: UP. So possible directions (can't reverse to DOWN) are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each direction:\n\n1. UP: next position (4,3). Let's confirm if that's a wall or body. (4,3) is in row 4 (which is between 0 and 7, so not a wall). The body is at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,3) is not part of the body. So safe. No apple here.\n\n2. LEFT: direction is LEFT. The head would move to (5,2). Check (5,2): row 5, column 2. Row 5 is \"#  H   #\", so column 2 is space (since H is at column 3). So (5,2) is space. The body is at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (5,2) is not part of the body. So safe. No apple here.\n\n3. RIGHT: direction is RIGHT. Head moves to (5,4). Check (5,4): row 5, column 4. Row 5 is \"#  H   #\", column 4 is space. So (5,4) is space. Body is at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (5,4) is not part of the body. So safe. No apple here.\n\nWait, but are there any apples nearby that we can reach? Let's check the positions of apples. Apples are at (1,4), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nThe head is at (5,3). Let's see the distance to each apple.\n\nApple at (4,4): (row 4, column 4). If the snake moves UP to (4,3), then next move could be RIGHT to (4,4) which is an apple. That would be good.\n\nApple at (4,5): (row 4, column 5). To reach that, the snake would need to go up to (4,3), then right to (4,4), then right to (4,5) (which is an apple).\n\nApple at (1,4): (row 1, column 4). That's higher up. The snake is at row 5. To reach row 1, it would need to move up 4 times (rows 5→4→3→2→1).\n\nBut let's think about the current movement. The snake is moving UP. If we continue moving UP, next position is (4,3). Then, if we turn right, we can reach (4,4) which is an apple. Let's check that path.\n\nCurrent head (5,3) → move UP to (4,3) (next step). Then, direction can be RIGHT (since current direction is UP, turning right is allowed). Then, moving right to (4,4) which is an apple. Eating that apple would increase the score and the snake would grow. That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if we turn RIGHT now (current direction UP, turn RIGHT), the head moves to (5,4). Then, next move could be UP (since direction is now RIGHT, can't reverse to LEFT. So possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN. But moving UP from (5,4) would take to (4,4), which is an apple. Oh, that's even better. Let's check:\n\nIf current direction is UP, and we choose RIGHT. Then, the new direction is RIGHT. The head moves to (5,4). (5,4) is a space, safe. Then, next move (epoch 9) direction could be UP (since current direction is RIGHT, turning UP is allowed). Then, moving UP from (5,4) to (4,4), which is an apple. That would be eaten, increasing the score. So that's a better path.\n\nWait, let's check (5,4) when moving RIGHT. (5,4) is in row 5, column 4. The row 5 is \"#  H   #\", so column 4 is a space (since H is at column 3). So (5,4) is safe. The body is at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). So (5,4) is not part of the body. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nThen, next move (epoch 9) direction could be UP. The head would be at (4,4), which is an apple. So that's a good move.\n\nSo if we choose RIGHT now, the next step (epoch 9) would be moving UP to (4,4) (apple). That's a better option than moving UP now and then RIGHT. Because that way, we can reach the apple in the next step.\n\nAnother option: if we move LEFT now (direction LEFT). The head moves to (5,2). Then, next move could be UP. (5,2) → (4,2). Then, (4,2) is a space, and no apple there. So that's not as good.\n\nSo the best direction is RIGHT. Because moving RIGHT now allows the next move to reach the apple at (4,4) in the next epoch. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head (5,3). Move RIGHT to (5,4). Then, next direction is UP (since current direction is RIGHT, turning UP is allowed). Then, move UP to (4,4), which is an apple. That would be eaten, increasing the score. So this path is better.\n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A A#\n#  H   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5,3) (row 5, column 3). The current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (4,3), which is empty (no apple or collision). This is safe but does not immediately approach an apple.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (5,2), which is empty (no apple or collision). This is safe but moves away from the nearest apples.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5,4), which is empty (no apple or collision). From (5,4), the next move can be UP (allowed, as the new direction would be RIGHT, and turning UP is not a reversal), leading to (4,4) in the next epoch, which contains an apple. This path directly approaches an apple and maximizes the chance to eat it soon.  \n\nChoosing RIGHT allows the snake to position itself to reach an apple in the next move, making it the optimal direction.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by visualizing the board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #   A  # (positions 3 is 'A')\nRow 2: #      # (empty)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #   A A# (positions 3 and 5 are 'A's)\nRow 5: #  SH  # (positions 2 is 'S', 3 is 'H')\nRow 6: # SS   # (positions 2 and 3 are 'S's)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at row 5, column 3 (since rows are 0-indexed from top). The body 'S's are at:\n- Row 5, column 2 (since row 5 is #  SH  #, so column 2 is 'S')\n- Row 6, column 2 and 3 (row 6 is # SS   #, so columns 2 and 3 are 'S's)\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction, so from RIGHT, it can't go LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (but moving RIGHT would continue in the same direction).\n\nLet's check the next position if the snake moves in each possible direction. Remember, the snake moves one square in the direction, and the head moves there. If that square is an apple, the snake grows (so the body doesn't shrink), otherwise, the tail moves (so the last 'S' is removed, and the head moves).\n\nFirst, current head position: (5,3). Let's note coordinates as (row, column), where row 0 is top, column 0 is left.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So the next position if moving RIGHT would be (5,4). Let's check that square.\n\nRow 5 is #  SH  #. Columns are 0: #, 1:  (space), 2: S, 3: H, 4:  (space), 5:  (space), 6: #. So (5,4) is a space. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (5,4). Now, check if that's a wall or body. The walls are the edges, so row 5, column 4 is within the board (columns 1-6 are the play area). The body is at (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). (5,4) is not a body part. So that's safe. But there's no apple there. So the snake would move, the tail (the last 'S') would be removed. Let's see the body: the current body is S at (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). The order of the body depends on the movement. Since the snake is moving RIGHT, the head was at (5,3). The previous positions would be: the body segments follow the head. Let's reconstruct the snake's path. Let's think about how the snake got here. The current direction is RIGHT, so the previous move was also RIGHT. Let's see:\n\nSuppose before the current state, the head was moving RIGHT. Let's track the body. Let's list the snake's segments in order (head first, then body, then tail). Let's see:\n\nCurrent head is at (5,3). The next segment (body) is (5,2) (since in row 5, it's ' SH '). Then the next is (6,2), then (6,3). Wait, row 6 is ' SS ', so columns 2 and 3 are 'S's. So the body segments are (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). That's a length of 4 (head + 3 bodies). Because the snake starts with length 1, each apple eaten increases length by 1. So current length is 4, which means 3 apples eaten (since initial length 1 + 3 apples = 4). The game starts with 3 apples, so maybe all apples are already eaten? Wait, no. The current board has apples in row 1 (column 3), row 4 (columns 3 and 5). Let's check:\n\nRow 1: #   A  # → column 3 is 'A' (so (1,3))\nRow 4: #   A A# → columns 3 and 5 are 'A's (so (4,3) and (4,5))\nSo there are 3 apples remaining. The snake's length is 4, which would mean 3 apples eaten (since 1 initial + 3 apples = 4). That makes sense.\n\nSo, when moving, the head moves to new position. If it's an apple, the body doesn't lose the tail (so length increases by 1). If not, the tail is removed (so length remains same).\n\nLet's check possible directions:\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse to LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n1. Direction RIGHT: New head position (5,4). Check if that's safe. (5,4) is within the board (row 5 is between 1 and 6, column 4 is between 1 and 6). The square is empty (no 'S' or '#'). So safe. No apple here. So the snake moves: head to (5,4), body segments follow. The tail (the last 'S') would be removed. The current body is (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). The new body would be (5,3) (old head), (5,2), (6,2). The tail (6,3) is removed. So the new board would have 'H' at (5,4), 'S's at (5,3), (5,2), (6,2). That's a possible move.\n\n2. Direction UP: New head position (4,3). Let's check (4,3). Row 4 is #   A A#. Column 3 is 'A'. Oh, that's an apple! So moving UP would take the head to (4,3), which is an apple. So the snake eats the apple, score increases by 1. The snake grows in length, so the tail is not removed. So the body would be the previous segments plus the new head. Let's see:\n\nCurrent body segments (after head) are (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). The head was at (5,3). When moving UP to (4,3), the new body segments would be (5,3) (old head), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). Because since it's an apple, the tail (6,3) is not removed. So the snake's length increases by 1 (from 4 to 5). Also, the apple at (4,3) is eaten, so that square becomes 'H' now, and the old head (5,3) becomes 'S'. Let's check if (4,3) is safe. The square (4,3) is an apple, not a wall or body. So no collision. So this is a valid move, and we get an apple. That's good.\n\n3. Direction DOWN: New head position (6,3). Let's check (6,3). Row 6 is # SS   #. Column 3 is 'S' (current body part). So moving DOWN would take the head to (6,3), which is a body segment. That's a collision with itself. So the game would end. So moving DOWN is invalid, as it causes a loss.\n\nSo possible directions are RIGHT (safe, no apple), UP (safe, apple), DOWN (collision, game over). So the best choice is UP, because it allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score and growing, which is better than moving RIGHT (no apple) or DOWN (game over).\n\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A A#\n#  SH  #\n# SS   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 5, column 3). The body 'S' segments are at (5,2), (6,2), and (6,3).\n2. **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT is invalid.\n3. **Possible Moves**:\n   - **RIGHT**: New head position is (5,4). This is a safe, empty space (no wall or body collision) but contains no apple. The snake would move without growing.\n   - **UP**: New head position is (4,3). This square contains an 'A' (apple). Eating the apple would grow the snake (length increases by 1), increase the score by 1, and avoid collision (no wall or body here).\n   - **DOWN**: New head position is (6,3). This square is occupied by the snake's own body ('S'), causing a collision and ending the game.\n\nThe best move is UP, as it allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and avoid collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's state. Let's start by repeating the game board as per the problem statement.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#   H A#\n#  SS  #\n# SS   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the epoch is 10. The snake starts moving in UP direction, and can't reverse direction. So, the possible directions the player can choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because if the current direction is UP, reversing would be DOWN, which is not allowed. So the possible directions are UP (same), LEFT (90 degrees left), RIGHT (90 degrees right).\n\nFirst, let's locate the snake's head. The head is 'H' in the board. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #   A  # (columns 3 is A)\nRow 2: # A    # (column 2 is A)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #   H A# (column 3 is H, column 5 is A)\nRow 5: #  SS  # (columns 2 and 3 are S)\nRow 6: # SS   # (columns 1 and 2 are S)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at row 4, column 3 (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top to bottom, columns 0-indexed from left to right). The current direction is UP, so the snake is moving upward. Let's confirm the snake's body to track its path.\n\nThe body 'S's are in row 5 (columns 2,3) and row 6 (columns 1,2). Let's list the body segments:\n\nRow 6, column 1: S\nRow 6, column 2: S\nRow 5, column 2: S\nRow 5, column 3: S\n\nSo the snake's body is a sequence. Since the snake moves, the head is at (4,3), and the body follows. The direction is UP, so the next move would be to (3,3) if direction remains UP. Let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake can't go DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Direction UP: The head moves from (4,3) to (3,3). Let's check if (3,3) is a wall, body, or apple.\n\nRow 3 is \"#      #\", so (3,3) is an empty cell (no wall, no body, no apple). So moving UP would take the head to (3,3). Since it's empty, the snake moves, and the body follows. The tail (the last S) would be removed unless an apple is eaten. But in this case, (3,3) is empty, so the snake's length remains the same (since no apple is eaten). So that's a safe move.\n\n2. Direction LEFT: The head moves from (4,3) to (4,2). Let's check (4,2). Row 4 is \"#   H A#\", so columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3:H, 4: space, 5:A, 6: space, 7: #. So (4,2) is a space (empty). Is that cell part of the snake's body? Let's check the body positions. The body is in row 5 (columns 2,3) and row 6 (columns 1,2). So (4,2) is not part of the body. So moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT: The head moves from (4,3) to (4,4). Let's check (4,4). Row 4: \"#   H A#\", so column 4 is a space. So (4,4) is empty. Is that part of the body? No, the body is in lower rows. So moving RIGHT to (4,4) is safe.\n\nNow, we need to check if any of these directions lead to an apple, which would increase the score. Let's see where the apples are.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1, column 3: A (position (1,3))\nRow 2, column 2: A (position (2,2))\nRow 4, column 5: A (position (4,5))\n\nSo the apples are at (1,3), (2,2), (4,5).\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (3,3): (3,3) is empty. No apple there. So no score increase.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT to (4,2): (4,2) is empty. No apple.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (4,4): (4,4) is empty. No apple.\n\nWait, the head is at (4,3). Let's check the current cell. The head is on (4,3). The cell (4,5) is an apple (A). So the head is not on an apple now. So the next move's target cell determines if an apple is eaten.\n\nNow, the current direction is UP. Let's think about the next possible moves and their outcomes.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way: check for potential collisions. For example, if the snake continues moving UP, the next position is (3,3). Then, the next move after that (epoch 11) would depend on direction again. But we need to choose the direction that avoids collision and maximizes apple eating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving towards the apples. Let's see the positions of the apples. The closest apples are (4,5) (right of the head), (2,2) (up-left), (1,3) (up).\n\nThe head is at (4,3). The apple at (4,5) is two cells to the right (columns 3→4→5). So if the snake turns RIGHT, then moves RIGHT again, it can reach that apple. But first, moving RIGHT once takes it to (4,4), which is safe.\n\nAnother apple at (2,2) is up two rows (from row 4 to 2) and left one column (column 3 to 2). So moving UP would take it towards row 3, then row 2, then left.\n\nThe apple at (1,3) is up three rows (row 4→3→2→1), same column. So moving UP would approach that apple.\n\nNow, the snake's body is in row 5 (columns 2,3) and row 6 (columns 1,2). Let's track the snake's body positions to avoid collision. The body segments are:\n\nAssuming the snake's movement history, since it's moving UP, the body would be in the positions the head was previously. Let's reconstruct the snake's path. The snake's head is at (4,3). The body segments in row 5 (columns 2,3) and row 6 (columns 1,2) suggest that the snake was moving upwards. Let's see:\n\nIf the head was at (5,3) in the previous step, then moved up to (4,3). Then the body would be at (5,3) (now S), and before that, the head was at (6,3), so body at (6,3) → but row 6 has S at (6,1) and (6,2). Hmm, maybe the snake's body is a chain. Let's list the body positions in order. The snake's body is a sequence of S's, with the order being from head to tail. The head is (4,3). The next segment (neck) would be where the head was before. Let's assume that the body is arranged such that each S is the previous position of the head.\n\nCurrent head at (4,3). The body in row 5, column 3 (S) would be the position the head was in before (epoch 9). Then row 5, column 2 (S) would be epoch 8, row 6, column 2 (S) epoch 7, row 6, column 1 (S) epoch 6. So the snake's path is (4,3) ← (5,3) ← (5,2) ← (6,2) ← (6,1). So the direction before that: moving from (6,1) to (6,2) (RIGHT), then (6,2) to (5,2) (UP), then (5,2) to (5,3) (RIGHT), then (5,3) to (4,3) (UP). So the current direction is UP (from (5,3) to (4,3)).\n\nSo, when the snake moves, the new head position is determined by the direction. Then, the body follows: each S moves to the position of the previous S. The tail (last S) is removed unless an apple is eaten (in which case the tail stays, increasing length).\n\nNow, considering the possible directions:\n\nIf we choose UP: new head at (3,3). Check if (3,3) is safe. The body after moving would be:\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nBody segments: (4,3) [old head], (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1). The tail (6,1) would be removed if no apple is eaten. So the new body would be (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2). So (3,3) is empty, so no collision. Safe.\n\nIf we choose LEFT: new head at (4,2). Check (4,2). Is that part of the body? The current body is (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1). (4,2) is not in these positions, so safe. The new body would be (4,3) [old head], (5,3), (5,2), (6,2). The tail (6,1) is removed. So (4,2) is safe.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: new head at (4,4). Check (4,4). The current body positions are (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1). (4,4) is not in these, so safe. The new body would be (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2). Safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple? Let's see the apples:\n\nApple at (4,5): to the right of the head (current head at (4,3), so (4,5) is two steps right). If the snake moves RIGHT now (to (4,4)), then next move could be RIGHT again (if possible) to (4,5), which is an apple. That would let the snake eat it, increasing the score. So moving RIGHT now would set up to reach that apple next step.\n\nApple at (1,3): up three steps. If the snake moves UP, then next steps could be UP again. But (3,3) is empty, then (2,3) (row 2 is \"# A    #\", column 3 is empty), then (1,3) which is an apple. So moving UP now would allow reaching (1,3) in three steps.\n\nApple at (2,2): up two steps (row 4→3→2) and left one (column 3→2). So moving UP then LEFT.\n\nBut which is more immediate? The apple at (4,5) is only two steps to the right. So if the snake moves RIGHT now, next move (epoch 11) direction could be RIGHT again (since current direction would be RIGHT, and can't reverse, but can go RIGHT again). Then, head moves to (4,5), which is the apple. That would be a good move.\n\nSo, moving RIGHT now (epoch 10) to (4,4), then in epoch 11, direction RIGHT to (4,5) (apple). That would eat the apple, increasing the score.\n\nAlternatively, if we move UP now, then next positions are (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) (apple). But that's three steps. So the apple at (4,5) is closer.\n\nSo the best direction to choose now is RIGHT, to approach the apple at (4,5) next step.\n\nNow, check if moving RIGHT would cause any collision. (4,4) is empty (row 4: \"#   H A#\", so column 4 is space). So moving RIGHT to (4,4) is safe.\n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#   H A#\n#  SS  #\n# SS   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head ('H') is at (row 4, column 3), moving upward ('UP'). The snake cannot reverse direction (so 'DOWN' is invalid), leaving 'UP', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT' as options.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (row 1, column 3), (row 2, column 2), and (row 4, column 5). The closest apple to the head is at (row 4, column 5) (2 steps to the right of the head).\n2. **Safety of Moves**:\n   - **UP**: The head moves to (row 3, column 3), which is empty and safe. No apple here.\n   - **LEFT**: The head moves to (row 4, column 2), which is empty and safe. No apple here.\n   - **RIGHT**: The head moves to (row 4, column 4), which is empty and safe. No apple here, but this positions the snake one step away from the apple at (row 4, column 5).\n\n### Strategy:\nMoving 'RIGHT' allows the snake to approach the nearest apple at (row 4, column 5). In the next epoch, continuing 'RIGHT' would let the snake eat this apple, increasing the score. This is more immediate than moving toward other apples, which are farther away.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by parsing the game board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #   A  # (so positions (1,3) is A)\nRow 2: # A    # (position (2,2) is A)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #   SHA# (positions (4,3)=S, (4,4)=H, (4,5)=A)\nRow 5: #  SS  # (positions (5,2)=S, (5,3)=S)\nRow 6: #  S   # (position (6,2)=S)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head (H) is at (4,4). Since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move without changing direction would take the head to (4,5), which is an apple (A). That's good because eating the apple would make the snake grow. But wait, let's check if moving RIGHT is possible. The snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is RIGHT, so possible directions to turn are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since reversing would be LEFT, which is not allowed). \n\nWait, the snake's movement direction can be changed to any direction except reversing. Since current direction is RIGHT, the snake can't turn LEFT (reverse). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's check where the head is and the possible next positions.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,4). Current direction RIGHT. So next position if moving RIGHT is (4,5). Let's check what's there. The row 4 is \"#   SHA#\", so (4,5) is 'A' (apple). So moving RIGHT would make the snake eat the apple. That's a good move because it increases the score and the snake grows. Also, we need to check if that move would cause a collision. The next position (4,5) is an apple, not a wall or snake body. So that's safe.\n\nWhat if we choose another direction? Let's see:\n\nIf direction is UP: the next head position would be (3,4). Let's check row 3: \"#      #\", which is empty. So (3,4) is empty. But is that a good move? The snake would move up, but there's no apple there. The apples are at (1,3), (2,2), and (4,5). So moving UP might not get an apple this time. Also, we need to make sure that moving UP doesn't lead to a collision in the next steps, but since it's the next move, we just need to check the immediate next position. The next position (3,4) is empty, so it's safe. But why not go for the apple?\n\nIf direction is DOWN: next head position would be (5,4). Let's check row 5: \"#  SS  #\". So (5,4) is a space (since positions 2 and 3 are S, 4 is empty). So (5,4) is empty. Safe, but no apple.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: that's reversing the current direction (current is RIGHT, so LEFT is reverse), which is not allowed. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo the best option is to continue moving RIGHT, which will take the head to the apple at (4,5). That way, the snake eats the apple, increases the score, and grows. Also, there's no collision because (4,5) is an apple, not a wall or body.\n\nLet me double-check the snake's body positions to ensure that moving RIGHT doesn't hit the body. The current body (S) positions are:\n\nRow 4: (4,3) = S\nRow 5: (5,2) = S, (5,3) = S\nRow 6: (6,2) = S\n\nSo the head is at (4,4). Next position (4,5) is A. So no collision with body. The walls are around the edges, so (4,5) is within the board (columns 0-7, so column 5 is valid). So moving RIGHT is safe and gets the apple. That's the best move.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#   SHA#\n#  SS  #\n#  S   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4) and is currently moving RIGHT. The next potential positions based on possible directions are:\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (4,5), which is an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body) and will allow the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score.\n- **UP**: Moves to (3,4), which is empty but no apple.\n- **DOWN**: Moves to (5,4), which is empty but no apple.\n- **LEFT**: Reverses the current direction (invalid per rules).\n\nMoving RIGHT is the optimal choice as it allows the snake to eat an apple without collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' walls. Let's list out each row to get a clear picture:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #   AA # (positions 3 and 4 are A)\nRow 2: # A    # (position 2 is A)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #   SSH# (positions 3,4,5 are S, S, H. So head is at (4,5) since rows are 0-based from top, columns 0-based from left)\nRow 5: #  SS  # (positions 2,3 are S)\nRow 6: #  S   # (position 2 is S)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right. Let's confirm the snake's body positions. The head is at (4,5). The body parts are the S's connected. Let's trace the body:\n\nFrom row 4: positions 3,4,5: so H is at (4,5), then the next S is at (4,4), then (4,3). Then row 5: positions 2,3 are S. So (5,3) and (5,2). Then row 6: position 2 is S. So (6,2). So the snake's body is: (4,5) H, (4,4) S, (4,3) S, (5,3) S, (5,2) S, (6,2) S. Let's check if that's correct. The order matters for movement. When the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So the body is a chain.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The next move direction can't be LEFT (since that's reversing). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since can't reverse).\n\nLet's think about the next position of the head if we choose each possible direction.\n\nFirst, the head is at (4,5) (row 4, column 5). The current direction is RIGHT, so if we keep moving RIGHT, the next head position would be (4,6). Let's check if that's a valid position.\n\nRow 4 is \"#   SSH#\". Columns 0-7. Column 5 is H, column 6 is the next. Let's check row 4, column 6: the row is \"#   SSH#\", which is columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: S, 5: S, 6: H, 7: #? Wait, wait, maybe I misread row 4. Let me re-examine row 4: \"#   SSH#\". Let's split into each character:\n\nRow 4: index 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is ' ', 4 is 'S', 5 is 'S', 6 is 'H', 7 is '#'. Oh! Oh right, I made a mistake earlier. So row 4 is \"#   SSH#\", which is:\n\nColumn 0: #\nColumn 1: ' '\nColumn 2: ' '\nColumn 3: ' '\nColumn 4: S\nColumn 5: S\nColumn 6: H\nColumn 7: #\n\nAh, that's different. So the head (H) is at (4,6), not (4,5). That's a critical error. Let's correct the positions.\n\nSo row 4: columns 4 is S, 5 is S, 6 is H. So H is (4,6). Then the body is S at (4,5), (4,4). Then row 5: \"#  SS  #\". Let's split row 5:\n\nRow 5: column 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: S, 4: S, 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So S at (5,3), (5,4). Then row 6: \"#  S   #\": column 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: S, 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So S at (6,2).\n\nSo the snake's body is:\n\nHead (H) at (4,6).\n\nBody segments (in order, since when moving, the next position of each body part is the previous position of the part in front):\n\nThe body is a chain. Let's list them in order from head to tail (since the head moves first, then each body part follows the previous part's position):\n\nHead: (4,6)\n\nNext body part (follows head): (4,5) (since head was here before moving right)\n\nNext: (4,4) (the S in row 4, column 4)\n\nThen: (5,4) (row 5, column 4: S)\n\nThen: (5,3) (row 5, column 3: S)\n\nThen: (6,2) (row 6, column 2: S)\n\nSo the snake's body positions are:\n\n(4,6) - H\n\n(4,5) - S\n\n(4,4) - S\n\n(5,4) - S\n\n(5,3) - S\n\n(6,2) - S\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because in the current board, the snake's body is arranged as follows:\n\nRow 4: ...SS H (columns 4,5,6)\n\nRow 5: ..SS (columns 3,4)\n\nRow 6: .S (column 2)\n\nSo the body is connected: H is at (4,6). The next S is (4,5), then (4,4). Then from (4,4), the next S is (5,4) (down from (4,4) to (5,4)), then (5,3) (left from (5,4) to (5,3)), then (6,2) (down from (5,3) to (6,2)). That's the snake's body structure.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So the snake is moving right. So the head is at (4,6). If we continue moving RIGHT, the next head position would be (4,7). But (4,7) is a wall (since row 4's column 7 is '#'), so that's a collision with the wall. That would end the game. So moving RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo we can't choose RIGHT, because that leads to a wall collision. So possible directions are UP, DOWN (since can't reverse direction, which would be LEFT). Because current direction is RIGHT, the reverse is LEFT, so we can't go LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (but RIGHT is into a wall). So only UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check each possible direction.\n\nOption 1: UP. Moving UP from (4,6). UP means row decreases by 1, column stays the same. So new head position is (3,6). Let's check what's in (3,6).\n\nRow 3 is \"#      #\". Columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (3,6) is a space. Is that position occupied by any part of the snake's body?\n\nThe snake's body positions are (4,6) (H), (4,5) (S), (4,4) (S), (5,4) (S), (5,3) (S), (6,2) (S). (3,6) is not in these positions, so no collision. So moving UP would be safe.\n\nOption 2: DOWN. Moving DOWN from (4,6). DOWN means row increases by 1, column stays the same. New head position is (5,6). Let's check (5,6).\n\nRow 5 is \"#  SS  #\". Columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: S, 4: S, 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (5,6) is a space. Check if (5,6) is part of the snake's body. The snake's body positions are (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,2). (5,6) is not in those, so no collision. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nNow, check if there's an apple in the new head position. Let's check the apples on the board.\n\nCurrent apples are in row 1: \"#   AA #\" (columns 3 and 4 are A). So (1,3) and (1,4) are apples.\n\nRow 2: \"# A    #\" (column 2 is A), so (2,2) is an apple.\n\nSo apples are at (1,3), (1,4), (2,2).\n\nIf moving UP: new head is (3,6). Is there an apple there? No, because (3,6) is empty.\n\nIf moving DOWN: new head is (5,6). Also empty.\n\nSo neither direction immediately eats an apple. But maybe we need to look for the next steps to find apples.\n\nBut the snake's goal is to eat as many apples as possible. Let's think about where the apples are and how the snake can reach them.\n\nThe apples are at (1,3), (1,4), (2,2). Let's note their positions.\n\nThe snake's current position is (4,6). Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf we move UP to (3,6), then next possible directions. Let's see:\n\nAfter moving UP, the new head is (3,6). The new direction could be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (but can't reverse from UP, which would be DOWN). Wait, no: the direction after moving is the direction the player input. So if we choose UP now, the direction becomes UP (since the snake moves in the direction given, unless it's reversing). So after moving UP, the current direction is UP, and the next move can't be DOWN.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose DOWN, direction becomes DOWN, next move can't be UP.\n\nLet's think about the snake's current body. The snake's length is 6 (head + 5 body segments). When it moves, the tail (the last S) will move only if it doesn't eat an apple. Since in this case, moving UP or DOWN doesn't eat an apple, the tail will move forward (the last segment is removed, and the head moves forward).\n\nWait, the example given in the problem: when the snake eats an apple, it grows. So when the head moves to an apple, the snake's length increases by 1 (so the tail doesn't move; the body adds a new segment). If the head doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves (the snake moves forward, same length).\n\nSo in this case, moving UP or DOWN would not eat an apple, so the snake's body would shift: the head moves to the new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail (the last S) is removed.\n\nSo, after moving UP (direction UP):\n\nNew head: (3,6)\n\nBody segments:\n\n(4,6) (old head) becomes S\n\n(4,5) becomes S\n\n(4,4) becomes S\n\n(5,4) becomes S\n\n(5,3) becomes S (since the tail was (6,2), which is removed. Wait, original body is H at (4,6), S at (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,2). So when moving, the new body is:\n\nnew head: (3,6)\n\nthen each S takes the position of the previous part. So:\n\nsegment 1: (4,6) (old head)\n\nsegment 2: (4,5) (old segment 1)\n\nsegment 3: (4,4) (old segment 2)\n\nsegment 4: (5,4) (old segment 3)\n\nsegment 5: (5,3) (old segment 4)\n\nThe old segment 5 (6,2) is removed (since no apple was eaten). So the new body after moving UP (without eating) would be:\n\nH at (3,6), S at (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, moving DOWN (direction DOWN):\n\nnew head: (5,6)\n\nbody segments:\n\n(4,6) (old head) → S\n\n(4,5) → S\n\n(4,4) → S\n\n(5,4) → S\n\n(5,3) → S\n\n(6,2) is removed.\n\nSo the new body would be H at (5,6), S at (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3).\n\nNow, which direction is better? Let's see the positions of the apples and possible paths.\n\nThe apples are at (1,3), (1,4), (2,2). Let's think about how the snake can reach them.\n\nThe snake is currently in the lower part of the board. The apples are in the upper part (rows 1 and 2). To reach them, the snake needs to move up.\n\nIf we choose UP now, the head is at (3,6). Then next possible directions (since direction is now UP) could be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't go DOWN). Let's see if moving UP again is possible. (3,6) → (2,6). Is (2,6) a wall? Row 2 is \"# A    #\". Column 6 is ' ' (since row 2: columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: A, 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #). So (2,6) is safe. Then next move could be UP to (1,6), which is row 1, column 6. Row 1 is \"#   AA #\", column 6 is ' ' (columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: A, 4: A, 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #). So (1,6) is safe. Then moving LEFT towards the apples at (1,3) and (1,4). That could be a path.\n\nAlternatively, if we move DOWN now, the head is at (5,6). Then next direction could be DOWN (row 6, column 6). Row 6 is \"#  S   #\", column 6 is ' ', so (6,6) is safe. Then next move DOWN to (7,6), which is a wall (row 7 is ########, column 6 is #). So can't go further down. Then possible directions would be LEFT, RIGHT, UP (since direction is DOWN, can't go UP). So moving LEFT from (6,6) to (6,5), which is safe, but that's moving away from the apples.\n\nSo moving UP seems better because it allows the snake to move towards the upper part where the apples are. Moving DOWN would take the snake towards the bottom wall, which limits movement options.\n\nAnother thing to check: when moving UP, the new head position (3,6) is not colliding with any body part. Correct.\n\nWhat about moving LEFT? Oh wait, the current direction is RIGHT, so the snake can't reverse direction. So LEFT is not allowed. So the options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. But RIGHT is into the wall (column 7 of row 4 is #), so RIGHT is invalid. So only UP or DOWN.\n\nBetween UP and DOWN, UP is better because it's moving towards the apples. So the best direction is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   AA #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#   SSH#\n#  SS  #\n#  S   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at (4,6) (row 4, column 6). The body segments are at (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), and (6,2).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT is invalid.\n- **Walls**: The board is surrounded by '#' walls. Moving RIGHT from (4,6) leads to (4,7), which is a wall (game over). Thus, RIGHT is invalid.\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,3), (1,4), and (2,2) (upper half of the board).\n- **Valid Moves**: Only UP and DOWN are possible.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (4,6) places the head at (3,6). This position is empty (no collision with walls or the snake's body). This direction moves the snake toward the upper half of the board, where apples are located, increasing the chance to reach apples in subsequent moves.\n   \n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (4,6) places the head at (5,6). This position is also empty, but it moves the snake toward the bottom wall (row 7), limiting future movement options and moving away from apples.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the better choice as it directs the snake toward the apples, maximizing the opportunity to eat them and grow.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #   AA # → positions (1,3), (1,4) are apples (A)\nRow 2: # A    # → position (2,2) is A\nRow 3: #     H# → the head (H) is at (3,5) (since rows are 0-indexed, and columns 0 to 7)\nRow 4: #   SSS# → body (S) at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\nRow 5: #  SS  # → body at (5,2), (5,3)\nRow 6: #      # → empty\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. The snake's head is at (3,5). Since the current direction is UP, the next move (without changing direction) would be to row 2, column 5 (since moving up decreases the row index). Let's check that position.\n\nRow 2 is \"# A    #\", so column 5 in row 2 is a space (since row 2 is [0]# [1]  [2]A [3]  [4]  [5]  [6]  [7]# → so (2,5) is empty. So if the snake continues UP, the head moves to (2,5), which is empty. Then, the body would follow. The snake's body is currently in (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,2), (5,3). Wait, the snake's length: let's count the S and H. The head is H (1), and S's are in row 4 (3 S's) and row 5 (2 S's). So total length is 1 (H) + 3 + 2 = 6? Because each S is part of the body. So when the snake moves, the head moves, and each body segment follows the previous one.\n\nBut first, we need to check possible directions. The current direction is UP. The snake can't reverse direction, so it can't go DOWN. So possible directions are UP (current), LEFT, RIGHT. Because reversing from UP would be DOWN, which is not allowed. So possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. UP: Moving to (2,5). What's there? Row 2, column 5 is empty (since row 2 is \"# A    #\", so positions are 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: A, 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (2,5) is ' '. So after moving, the head is at (2,5). The body would shift. The previous head was at (3,5), which becomes S. The next body parts would follow. So the new body would be (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,2), (5,3)? Wait, no. The snake's body is a sequence. Let's think about the snake's body segments in order. The head is H at (3,5). The body segments are the S's that follow. Let's reconstruct the snake's body path.\n\nLooking at row 4: #   SSS# → (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are S. So (4,5) is adjacent to the head (3,5) in the UP direction? Because the head is at (3,5), and (4,5) is directly below. So if the snake was moving UP, the previous position of the head would have been (4,5), then (3,5). So the body segments are (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2). Because the snake moves by adding a new head and removing the tail unless it eats an apple.\n\nWait, when the snake moves, each time it moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the body is a chain. Let's think about the current snake's body structure. Let's list the positions in order (from head to tail):\n\nHead: (3,5)\n\nThen, the next segment (since moving UP, the previous head position was (4,5)), so (4,5) is the next body segment.\n\nThen (4,4), then (4,3), then (5,3), then (5,2). Let's check:\n\nRow 4: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are S → yes, 4,5 is S (adjacent below head). Then 4,4 is next. Then 4,3. Then row 5: (5,3) is S, then (5,2) is S. So the body sequence is:\n\nHead: (3,5)\n\nBody segments: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2). So total length is 1 (head) + 5 (body) = 6.\n\nIf the snake moves UP (current direction), the new head position is (2,5). Then the body segments would be:\n\nNew head: (2,5)\n\nBody segments become: (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3). Because the tail (5,2) would be removed unless the snake eats an apple. But since (2,5) is empty (no apple), the snake doesn't grow, so the tail (5,2) is removed. So the new body would be (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3). Let's check if this new head (2,5) is valid. (2,5) is within the board (row 2 is between 0 and 7, column 5 is between 0 and 7). No wall there. And the new head (2,5) is not colliding with any body segment (the new body segments are (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3)). So (2,5) is safe. So moving UP is possible.\n\n2. LEFT: Direction is LEFT. The snake is currently moving UP. Can it turn LEFT? Yes, because LEFT is not the reverse direction (reverse of UP is DOWN). So allowed. Moving LEFT would mean the head moves to (3,4). Let's check (3,4). The current row 3 is \"#     H#\", which is [0]# [1]  [2]  [3]  [4]  [5]H [6]  [7]#. So (3,4) is a space. So new head is (3,4). Now, check for collision. The body segments (before moving) are (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2). The new head (3,4) is not in any of these positions. So that's safe. After moving LEFT, the new body would be (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3). Because the tail (5,2) is removed. So (3,4) is safe.\n\n3. RIGHT: Direction is RIGHT. The head would move to (3,6). Check row 3: \"#     H#\", so (3,6) is a space (since H is at (3,5), next is (3,6) which is ' '). So new head (3,6). Check collision. The body segments (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2) are all not (3,6). So (3,6) is safe.\n\nNow, the snake wants to eat apples. Let's check where the apples are. Current apples are:\n\nRow 1: (1,3), (1,4) → positions (1,3) and (1,4)\n\nRow 2: (2,2) → position (2,2)\n\nSo the apples are at (1,3), (1,4), (2,2).\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (2,5), that's not an apple.\n\nIf it moves LEFT to (3,4), (3,4) is empty.\n\nIf it moves RIGHT to (3,6), (3,6) is empty.\n\nHmm. Are there any apples in the possible next positions? Let's see. The next positions for each direction:\n\nUP → (2,5): no apple.\n\nLEFT → (3,4): no.\n\nRIGHT → (3,6): no.\n\nSo none of the immediate next moves have apples. So the snake needs to plan to reach the apples. Let's think about the snake's path.\n\nCurrent head at (3,5). The apples are at (1,3), (1,4), (2,2).\n\nLet's think about the snake's body. The body is in (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2). So the snake is coiled a bit in the lower part. The head is in row 3, column 5.\n\nIf the snake continues moving UP (to (2,5)), then next possible moves could be further UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see (2,5) is in row 2. From (2,5), possible directions (since current direction would then be UP). The apples are at (2,2), which is left and up. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT from current position (3,5) to (3,4). Then, next direction could be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since direction would be LEFT now). From (3,4), moving UP would take to (2,4). Let's check (2,4) in row 2: \"# A    #\", so (2,4) is ' ' (since (2,2) is A). (2,4) is empty.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (3,6), then next direction could be UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. From (3,6), moving UP to (2,6), which is row 2, column 6. Row 2 is \"# A    #\", so (2,6) is ' '.\n\nBut maybe the best approach is to avoid the body and walls. Let's check possible collisions in the next steps.\n\nCurrent body is in (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2). Let's see if any direction leads to collision with the body in the next move.\n\nIf moving UP to (2,5): (2,5) is empty, no collision.\n\nIf moving LEFT to (3,4): (3,4) is empty, no collision.\n\nIf moving RIGHT to (3,6): (3,6) is empty, no collision.\n\nSo all three directions are possible. Now, which direction would lead the snake towards the apples?\n\nThe apples are in row 1 and 2, left side. The head is at (3,5), which is right side. So to reach the apples, the snake might need to move left and up.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT now (direction LEFT), the head goes to (3,4). Then, in the next move, if it continues LEFT (direction LEFT), the head would go to (3,3). Let's check (3,3) in row 3: \"#     H#\" → (3,3) is ' ' (since H is at (3,5), positions 3,3 is ' '). (3,3) is safe. Then, next move LEFT again to (3,2). Then, (3,2) is ' ' (row 3: [0]# [1]  [2]  [3]  [4]  [5]H [6]  [7]# → (3,2) is ' '). Then, moving UP from (3,2) to (2,2), which is the apple at (2,2). That's a good path. So moving LEFT now could lead towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves UP to (2,5), then from there, moving LEFT to (2,4), then (2,3), then (2,2) (the apple). That's another path. Let's see:\n\nCurrent direction is UP. If we move UP, head is (2,5). Then, next possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't go DOWN). Let's say we then go LEFT to (2,4). Then, LEFT again to (2,3), then LEFT to (2,2) (apple). That's 3 moves to reach (2,2).\n\nIf we move LEFT now (current direction UP, turn LEFT), head (3,4). Then, direction is LEFT. Next move LEFT to (3,3), then LEFT to (3,2), then UP to (2,2). That's also 3 moves. Either path could work.\n\nBut we need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Let's check the body positions. The body is in (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2). So if the snake moves LEFT to (3,4), the next body segments would be (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3). So (3,4) is safe. Then moving LEFT to (3,3), the body would be (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3). (3,3) is safe. Then (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4). (3,2) is safe. Then moving UP to (2,2) (apple), which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP first: (2,5). Body becomes (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3). Then, moving LEFT to (2,4). Body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3). (2,4) is safe. Then LEFT to (2,3), body (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4). (2,3) is safe. Then LEFT to (2,2) (apple). That's also safe.\n\nSo both paths are possible. But which direction is better now?\n\nAnother thing to consider is the snake's current body positions. Let's check if any direction could lead to a collision in the next steps. For example, if the snake moves RIGHT, the head goes to (3,6). Then, next possible directions are UP, RIGHT, LEFT. If it goes RIGHT again, (3,7) is a wall (since row 3 is \"#     H#\", column 7 is '#'). So (3,7) is a wall. So moving RIGHT to (3,6) is okay, but moving further RIGHT would hit the wall. So moving RIGHT might not be the best option, as it's towards the wall.\n\nSo between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT, RIGHT is towards the wall, so less favorable. UP and LEFT are better. Between UP and LEFT, perhaps LEFT is better because it's moving towards the apples (which are on the left side of the board) rather than up (which is towards row 1, but the apples in row 1 are at (1,3) and (1,4), which are left of the current head position).\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,5) is in row 2, which has an apple at (2,2). So moving left from (2,5) would approach that apple.\n\nBut perhaps the best immediate direction is LEFT. Because moving LEFT now would start the snake moving towards the left side where the apples are, whereas moving UP would take it up but still on the right side. So the snake needs to navigate left to reach the apples.\n\nSo I think the best direction to choose is LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   AA #\n# A    #\n#     H#\n#   SSS#\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head is at (3,5) (row 3, column 5), moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid), leaving UP, LEFT, and RIGHT as valid options.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,3), (1,4), and (2,2) (row 1, columns 3-4; row 2, column 2).\n2. **Body Positions**: The snake’s body segments are at (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2).\n3. **Collision Checks**: None of the immediate next positions (UP to (2,5), LEFT to (3,4), RIGHT to (3,6)) collide with the body or walls.\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n- **UP**: Moving to (2,5) (row 2, column 5) is safe but empty (no apple). This moves the head upward but keeps it on the right side of the board, requiring additional leftward movement to reach apples.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (3,6) (row 3, column 6) is safe but empty. This moves the head toward the right wall (column 7 is a wall), limiting future movement options.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (3,4) (row 3, column 4) is safe and empty. This starts the snake moving left toward the apples (e.g., (2,2)) and avoids the wall, creating a path to reach apples in subsequent moves.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the best choice, as it directs the snake toward the left side of the board where apples are located, avoiding walls and setting up a path to eat apples in future moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls (marked with #). Let's list out each row to see where everything is:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #   AA # → So positions (1,3) and (1,4) are apples (A)\nRow 2: # A    # → Position (2,2) is an A\nRow 3: #    HS# → Let's see, columns are 0-7. So row 3, columns 4 is H (head), column 5 is S (body)\nRow 4: #   SSS# → Row 4, columns 3,4,5 are S (body)\nRow 5: #   S  # → Row 5, column 3 is S\nRow 6: #      # → Empty\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. Let's confirm the head's position. In row 3, the head is at (3,4) (since row 3 is \"#    HS#\" → positions 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: H, 5: S, 6: #). So H is at (3,4). The current direction is LEFT, so the next move (if direction doesn't change) would be to (3,3) because moving left decreases the column by 1.\n\nBut we need to decide the direction input. The snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is LEFT, the snake can't immediately turn RIGHT (since that's the opposite). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since continuing LEFT is allowed).\n\nLet's check possible moves:\n\nFirst, current head position is (3,4). Let's note the body positions to check for self-collision. The body is in row 3, column 5 (S), row 4 columns 3,4,5 (SSS), row 5 column 3 (S). So body positions are (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3).\n\nNow, let's consider each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT (current direction, allowed). Next head position: (3,3). Let's check if that's a wall or body. (3,3) is a space (since row 3 is \"#    HS#\" → columns 0-3 are #, space, space, space). So (3,3) is empty. What's there? Let's check the current board. Row 3 is \"#    HS#\", so column 3 is a space. So moving left to (3,3) is safe. What's in (3,3)? It's empty. So after moving, the snake's head is there, and the body follows. Since no apple is eaten, the length remains the same. The tail (the last part of the body) would move. But the current snake's body is: H at (3,4), then S at (3,5), then S at (4,5), S at (4,4), S at (4,3), S at (5,3). So the snake's body is a chain. When moving left, the new head is (3,3), then the next positions are (3,4) (old head), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), and the tail would be (5,3) moving out. So no collision here.\n\n2. UP: Let's check if possible. Current direction is LEFT, so turning UP is allowed (not opposite). The next head position would be (2,4) (since moving up from (3,4) → row decreases by 1). Let's check (2,4). Row 2 is \"# A    #\", columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: A, 3: space, 4: space, 5: space, 6: #. So (2,4) is a space. Is there a body there? The current body positions are (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3). (2,4) is not in those. So moving up to (2,4) is safe. What's in (2,4)? It's empty. So no apple eaten here.\n\n3. DOWN: Current direction is LEFT, so turning DOWN is allowed. Next head position would be (4,4) (row increases by 1 from (3,4)). Let's check (4,4). Row 4 is \"#   SSS#\", so columns 3,4,5 are S. So (4,4) is part of the body (since S is there). So moving down would make the head hit the body. That's a collision, game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\n4. RIGHT: Current direction is LEFT, so turning RIGHT is reversing direction, which is not allowed. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT, UP.\n\nNow, let's check if moving in these directions leads to apples. Let's see where the apples are. Apples are at (1,3), (1,4), (2,2).\n\nIf we move LEFT to (3,3): next position (3,3). What's around there? Let's see. The next move (epoch 15) would be in direction chosen. Let's think about future moves. But maybe we can check if moving LEFT now gets us closer to an apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,4). Let's see what's in (2,4) → empty. Then next move would depend on direction. If we move UP again, next head would be (1,4), which is an apple (since row 1, column 4 is A). Oh, that's a good point. Let's see:\n\nIf current direction is LEFT, but we choose UP. Then the next direction could be UP again (since it's allowed). Let's check:\n\nCurrent head is (3,4). Choosing UP → new head (2,4). Then, if next direction is UP again (assuming we can choose that), next head would be (1,4), which is an apple (A at row 1, column 4). That would be good, as eating the apple increases the score.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (3,3). Then, next direction could be UP. Let's see. From (3,3), moving UP would take us to (2,3). What's (2,3)? Row 2 is \"# A    #\", column 3 is space. Then moving up again to (1,3), which is an apple (A at row 1, column 3). So that's another apple.\n\nBut let's think about the immediate next move. Let's check the current positions again.\n\nCurrent head (3,4). Let's list all apple positions:\n\n- (1,3) → row 1, column 3.\n\n- (1,4) → row 1, column 4.\n\n- (2,2) → row 2, column 2.\n\nIf we move UP now to (2,4), then the next move (epoch 15) direction could be UP again (since direction can be changed as long as not reversed). So (2,4) → (1,4), which is an apple. That's a direct path to an apple. That's a good move.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (3,3), then next direction could be UP. (3,3) → (2,3) (next move), then (1,3) (apple). Also a path to an apple.\n\nBut let's check if moving UP now (epoch 14) would hit anything. The new head is (2,4). Let's confirm (2,4) is not a body part. Current body positions are (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3). (2,4) is not in those, so safe.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,3): (3,3) is not a body part (body is at (3,5), (4,3), etc.), so safe.\n\nSo which direction is better? Let's see. The current direction is LEFT. If we choose UP, then the next move (epoch 15) can be UP again, leading to (1,4) which is an apple. So that's a direct path. That's better because we can eat an apple in the next step.\n\nIf we choose LEFT, then the next move (epoch 15) direction could be UP. Let's see, (3,3) → (2,3) (moving UP). Then (2,3) is a space, then next move (epoch 16) could be UP again to (1,3) (apple). So that's two steps to the apple.\n\nBut moving UP now allows us to reach (1,4) in the next step (epoch 15). So that's faster. So choosing UP now would be better.\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any walls in the way? For moving UP from (3,4) to (2,4) to (1,4): (1,4) is within the board (row 1 is between 0 and 7, column 4 is 0-7). So no walls there.\n\nSo the best direction here is UP. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT. But DOWN leads to body collision (head (3,4) moving down to (4,4) which is S). So DOWN is invalid. So options are UP or LEFT.\n\nUP is safe, and leads to a path where next move can reach an apple. LEFT is safe but takes longer to reach an apple. So the answer should be UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   AA #\n# A    #\n#    HS#\n#   SSS#\n#   S  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and collision risks:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head ('H') is at (row 3, column 4).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT (snake is moving left).\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (1,3), (1,4), and (2,2).\n- **Body Positions**: Body segments ('S') are at (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and (5,3).\n- **Collision Rules**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., LEFT → RIGHT) and loses if it hits walls or itself.\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT (Current Direction)**:  \n   Moving left would take the head to (3,3). This position is empty (no walls or body segments), so it is safe. However, (3,3) does not contain an apple, and reaching the nearest apple (at (1,3)) would require additional moves.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Moving up would take the head to (2,4). This position is empty (no walls or body segments), so it is safe. From (2,4), the next move (if direction remains UP) would reach (1,4), which contains an apple. This path allows the snake to eat an apple in the next epoch.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Moving down would take the head to (4,4). This position is occupied by the snake's body (segment at (4,4)), causing an immediate collision. This direction is invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT**:  \n   Reversing direction (LEFT → RIGHT) is not allowed. This direction is invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe safest and most optimal direction is **UP**, as it avoids collisions and positions the snake to eat an apple in the next move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#   AA #\n# A  H #\n#    SS#\n#   SSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the current epoch is 15. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S', apples are 'A', and walls are '#'. \n\nFirst, let's locate the snake's head. Looking at the board, the third row (since the first row is ########) is \"# A  H #\". So row 2 (0-based index 2) has H at position (2,5) maybe? Let's check the rows:\n\nRow 0: ######## (indices 0-7)\nRow 1: #   AA # → positions 1-6: [1] is #, 2 is space, 3 is space, 4 is A, 5 is A, 6 is space, 7 is #. So positions (1,4) and (1,5) are apples.\nRow 2: # A  H # → positions 1: #, 2: A, 3: space, 4: space, 5: H, 6: space, 7: #. So H is at (2,5).\nRow 3: #    SS# → positions 1: #, 2: space, 3: space, 4: space, 5: S, 6: S, 7: #. So S at (3,5), (3,6).\nRow 4: #   SSS# → positions 1: #, 2: space, 3: space, 4: S, 5: S, 6: S, 7: #. So S at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\nRows 5 and 6 are #      #, so empty except for walls.\n\nSo the snake's head is at (2,5). The current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving upward. Let's think about the next move. The snake moves one square in the current direction (UP) unless we change direction. But the snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is UP, the possible directions we can choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't go DOWN because that's reversing).\n\nLet's check where the head would go next for each possible direction.\n\nCurrent head position: (2,5) (row 2, column 5). Let's index rows from top to bottom, 0-7. Columns 0-7 (each row has 8 characters).\n\nIf direction is UP (current direction), the next head position would be row 1, column 5. Let's check that cell. Row 1 is \"#   AA #\", which at column 5 is 'A'. So moving UP would take the head to (1,5), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple would grow the snake and increase the score. Also, need to check if that position is a wall or body. (1,5) is within the board (row 1 is not 0 or 7, column 5 is 1-6, so not a wall). The body is in rows 3 and 4, so (1,5) is not a body part. So moving UP would be safe and eat an apple.\n\nIf direction is LEFT, the next head position is (2,4). Let's check row 2, column 4. Row 2 is \"# A  H #\", so column 4 is a space (since H is at 5, so 4 is space). So (2,4) is empty. But we need to check if that's a body part. The body is in row 3 (5,6), row 4 (4,5,6). So (2,4) is not a body part, and not a wall. So moving LEFT would be safe, but there's no apple there.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT, the next head position is (2,6). Row 2, column 6 is a space (since row 2 is \"# A  H #\", which is 1: #, 2: A, 3: space, 4: space, 5: H, 6: space, 7: #). So (2,6) is space. Check body: no, so safe. But no apple here.\n\nIf direction is DOWN, that's reversing the current direction (current is UP), which is not allowed. So can't choose DOWN.\n\nSo the best option is to continue moving UP, which will take the head to (1,5) which is an apple. That's safe, and it's a good move to eat the apple. Let's confirm the next positions.\n\nCurrent snake's body is in row 3 (SS at 5,6) and row 4 (SSS at 4,5,6). The snake's length is 1 (head) + 5 (S's) = 6? Let's count S's: row 3 has 2 S's (5,6), row 4 has 3 S's (4,5,6). So total 5 S's. So the snake's length is 6 (head + 5 body). When moving, the body follows. So when the head moves up to (1,5), the body will shift. The previous head position (2,5) becomes a body part (S), and the rest of the body follows. So the new body would be (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). But since the snake ate an apple, it grows by 1, so the tail doesn't shrink. So the new body would have all previous body parts plus the old head. So that's safe.\n\nSo moving UP is the best choice here.\n\n\n########\n#   AA #\n# A  H #\n#    SS#\n#   SSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- The snake's head (H) is at row 2, column 5.\n- Current direction is UP (snake is moving upward).\n- Possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is invalid as it reverses the current direction).\n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to row 1, column 5. This cell contains an apple ('A').  \n   - Safety check: Row 1 is within the board (not a wall), and the cell is not occupied by the snake's body (body is in rows 3 and 4).  \n   - Outcome: Safe, eats the apple, increases score, and the snake grows.  \n\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to row 2, column 4. This cell is empty (no apple).  \n   - Safety check: Safe (no wall or body collision), but no apple is eaten.  \n\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to row 2, column 6. This cell is empty (no apple).  \n   - Safety check: Safe (no wall or body collision), but no apple is eaten.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is the best choice, as it allows the snake to safely eat an apple, grow, and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position and direction.\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the snake is moving upwards. The game board is 8x8 with walls around. Let me parse the board line by line:\n\nLine 0: ######## (top wall)\nLine 1: #   AH # (so positions 1,1: ' ', 1,2: ' ', 1,3: 'A', 1,4: 'H', 1,5: ' ' )\nLine 2: # A  S # (positions 2,1: ' ', 2,2: 'A', 2,3: ' ', 2,4: 'S', 2,5: ' ' )\nLine 3: #    SS# (positions 3,1: ' ', 3,2: ' ', 3,3: ' ', 3,4: 'S', 3,5: 'S' )\nLine 4: #  ASSS# (positions 4,1: ' ', 4,2: 'A', 4,3: 'S', 4,4: 'S', 4,5: 'S' )\nLine 5: #      # (positions 5,1-6: ' ')\nLine 6: #      # (positions 6,1-6: ' ')\nLine 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head is at (1,4) (since line 1 is row 1, columns 0 to 7). The body parts are S's. Let's list all the S positions:\n\n- Line 1 has H at (1,4)\n- Line 2 has S at (2,4)\n- Line 3 has S at (3,4) and (3,5)\n- Line 4 has S at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nSo the snake's body is a chain. The current direction is UP, so the next move would be the head moving up to (0,4). But wait, line 0 is all # (walls), so (0,4) is a wall. If the snake moves UP, it will hit the wall and the game ends. That's bad. So we can't choose UP.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is UP, the opposite is DOWN. So we can't go DOWN immediately. So possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nCurrent head position is (1,4). Moving LEFT would take it to (1,3). What's at (1,3)? The board line 1 is \"#   AH #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: '#'. So (1,3) is 'A' (an apple). That's good. If we move LEFT, the head goes to (1,3), which is an apple. Then the snake will eat it, grow longer. The new head is (1,3), and the body will follow. The previous positions (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) will become S's. The apple at (1,3) is eaten, so that position becomes H, and a new apple might be placed elsewhere (but the problem says the next state example, the eaten apple is replaced by S or H).\n\nWait, let's check if moving LEFT is possible. The direction is LEFT. Since current direction is UP, LEFT is a valid turn (not opposite). So allowed.\n\nWhat about moving RIGHT? The head is at (1,4). Moving RIGHT would take it to (1,5). Let's check (1,5). Line 1: \"#   AH #\", so column 5 is ' ' (since 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: '#'). So (1,5) is empty. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (1,5). But is there a body part there? Let's see. The current body S's are at (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So (1,5) is empty. So that's safe. But there's no apple there, so no score increase.\n\nSo options are LEFT (apple) or RIGHT (empty). Let's check if moving LEFT would cause a collision. The new head is (1,3), which is 'A' (apple). The body parts are the previous positions. Since the snake is moving, the body follows. The head moves to (1,3), and the body segments shift. So the previous head (1,4) becomes S, then (2,4) becomes S, etc. So (1,3) is new H, (1,4) becomes S, (2,4) stays S, (3,4) stays S, (3,5) stays S, (4,3) stays S, (4,4) stays S, (4,5) stays S. No collision here because (1,3) is not a body part. So moving LEFT is safe and gets an apple. That's better.\n\nSo the best direction is LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#   AH #\n# A  S #\n#    SS#\n#  ASSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at (row 1, column 4) (0-indexed).\n- Current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN.\n- Possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT (since UP is blocked by a wall, and DOWN is reversed).\n\n**UP Check**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 0, column 4), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. Invalid.\n\n**LEFT Check**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 1, column 3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake. The new head position (1,3) is not occupied by the snake's body (current body segments are at (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)), so no collision. Safe and beneficial.\n\n**RIGHT Check**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (row 1, column 5), which is empty (' '). No apple is eaten, and no collision occurs, but this does not improve the score. Less optimal than LEFT.\n\nThus, the best direction is LEFT to eat the apple safely.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' as walls. Let's list out each row to get a clear picture:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #   HSA# (so positions 1,2,3,4,5,6: index 1 is '#', 2 is ' ', 3 is ' ', 4 is 'H' (head), 5 is 'S' (body), 6 is 'A' (apple), 7 is '#')\nRow 2: # A  S # (positions: 1='#', 2=' ', 3='A', 4=' ', 5=' ', 6='S', 7='#')\nRow 3: #    SS# (positions: 1='#', 2=' ', 3=' ', 4=' ', 5='S', 6='S', 7='#')\nRow 4: #  ASSS# (positions: 1='#', 2=' ', 3=' ', 4='A', 5='S', 6='S', 7='#')\nRow 5: #      # (all spaces except edges)\nRow 6: #      # (same)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake's head is at (1,4) assuming rows are 0-7 and columns 0-7. Wait, let's index properly. Let's consider row 1 as the second row (since row 0 is the top). So rows are 0 (top) to 7 (bottom). Each row has columns 0 (left) to 7 (right). So for row 1 (index 1), the characters are at columns 0 to 7. So row 1: columns 0 is '#', column 1 is ' ', column 2 is ' ', column 3 is 'H' (since the string is \"#   HSA#\" which is 8 characters. Let's count: 0:'#', 1:' ', 2:' ', 3:'H', 4:'S', 5:'A', 6:'#'. Oh wait, wait. Let's parse each row correctly. Let's take row 1: \"#   HSA#\" — that's 8 characters. So indexes 0 to 7:\n\n0: '#'\n1: ' '\n2: ' '\n3: 'H'\n4: 'S'\n5: 'A'\n6: '#'\nWait, 0 to 7, so 8 characters. So row 1 is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: 'S', 5: 'A', 6: '#', 7: '#'? Wait no, the string is \"#   HSA#\" — that's 8 characters. Let's count:\n\nCharacter 0: '#'\nCharacter 1: ' '\nCharacter 2: ' '\nCharacter 3: ' '\nCharacter 4: 'H'\nCharacter 5: 'S'\nCharacter 6: 'A'\nCharacter 7: '#'\n\nAh, that's right. Because \"#   HSA#\" has 1 (0) #, then three spaces (1,2,3), then H (4), S (5), A (6), then # (7). So row 1 (second row from top) has H at (row 1, column 4).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So the snake is moving left. Let's confirm the direction: moving left means the next position of the head would be column 3 (since left is decreasing column index). So the head is at (row 1, column 4). Next position if moving left would be (row 1, column 3). Let's check what's there. In row 1, column 3 is ' ' (space). So if we continue moving LEFT, the head moves to (1,3), which is empty. Then the snake's body would follow. But we need to check possible collisions.\n\nBut the player can choose a new direction, but cannot reverse. The current direction is LEFT. So the snake can't reverse to RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. Because reversing (to RIGHT) is not allowed.\n\nLet's check the possible next moves:\n\n1. Continue LEFT (current direction). The head moves to (1,3). What's in (1,3)? In row 1, column 3 is ' ' (since row 1 is \"#   HSA#\" — columns 0-7: 0='#', 1=' ', 2=' ', 3=' ', 4='H', 5='S', 6='A', 7='#'). So (1,3) is a space. So that's safe. Then, the snake's body would shift. The previous head was (1,4), which becomes part of the body (since the snake moves, the body follows). The rest of the body segments would shift. Let's check the body positions. The current snake's body: H is at (1,4). Then S is at (1,5) (row 1, column 5). Then in row 2, column 6: (2,6) is 'S'. Row 3 has (3,5) and (3,6) as 'S's. Row 4 has (4,5), (4,6), (4,4) as 'S's (row 4 is \"#  ASSS#\" — columns 0='#', 1=' ', 2=' ', 3='A', 4='S', 5='S', 6='S', 7='#'). So (4,4) is S, (4,5) is S, (4,6) is S. So the body segments are:\n\nH: (1,4)\n\nThen S: (1,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 1: columns 4 is H, 5 is S → so (1,4)=H, (1,5)=S.\n\nRow 2: column 6 is S → (2,6)=S.\n\nRow 3: columns 5 and 6 are S → (3,5)=S, (3,6)=S.\n\nRow4: columns 4,5,6 are S → (4,4)=S, (4,5)=S, (4,6)=S.\n\nSo the snake's body is a sequence. Let's list the body segments in order (since the snake moves, the body follows the head). The head is first, then the next segment is where the head was, etc. So the current snake's positions (from head to tail) would be:\n\nHead: (1,4)\n\nThen next segment: (1,5) (since moving left, the previous position before the last move was (1,5) when the head was there, but now the head is at (1,4). Wait, maybe the snake's body is arranged such that each S is a part of the body. So the snake's length is 1 (head) plus the number of S's. Let's count S's:\n\nRow 1 has 1 S (column 5).\n\nRow 2 has 1 S (column 6).\n\nRow 3 has 2 S's (columns 5,6).\n\nRow 4 has 3 S's (columns 4,5,6). Total S's: 1+1+2+3=7. So total length is 1 (H) +7 (S) =8. So the snake is 8 units long.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the tail (last S) would move forward, but if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move (since the snake grows).\n\nNow, the possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, LEFT (since current direction is LEFT, can't go RIGHT).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible direction:\n\nOption 1: LEFT (current direction). Next head position is (1,3). Check if that's a wall or body. (1,3) is a space (from row 1: \"#   HSA#\" → column 3 is ' '). So safe. No collision. Then, the snake moves. The new head is (1,3). The old head (1,4) becomes S. The rest of the body shifts. The tail (which was at (4,6)) would move to (4,5), (4,5) to (4,4), (4,4) to (3,6), (3,6) to (3,5), (3,5) to (2,6), (2,6) to (1,5), (1,5) to (1,4). So the body would adjust. No apple here, so score doesn't increase.\n\nOption 2: UP. Current direction is LEFT. Turning UP is allowed (since UP is not the reverse of LEFT). So moving UP would change direction to UP, and the head moves to (0,4). Wait, row 0 is the top wall. (0,4) is part of the wall (row 0 is \"########\", all columns 0-7 are '#'). So (0,4) is a wall. So moving UP would cause a collision with the wall. Game over. So UP is invalid.\n\nOption 3: DOWN. Current direction is LEFT. Turning DOWN is allowed (not reverse). So direction becomes DOWN. The head moves from (1,4) down to (2,4). Let's check (2,4). Row 2 is \"# A  S #\". Let's parse row 2 (columns 0-7): 0='#', 1=' ', 2='A', 3=' ', 4=' ', 5=' ', 6='S', 7='#'. So column 4 of row 2 is ' ' (space). So (2,4) is a space. So that's safe. No collision. Then the snake moves. The new head is (2,4). The old head (1,4) becomes S. The body shifts as usual.\n\nOption 4: RIGHT. But current direction is LEFT. Reversing direction (LEFT → RIGHT) is not allowed. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo the possible valid directions are LEFT and DOWN. Let's check if any of these directions lead to apples.\n\nIf we choose LEFT: next head position (1,3). Is there an apple there? (1,3) is ' ', no.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: next head position (2,4). Let's check row 2, column 4: ' ' (as per row 2: \"# A  S #\", which is 0='#',1=' ',2='A',3=' ',4=' ',5=' ',6='S',7='#'). So (2,4) is space. So no apple.\n\nWait, but where are the apples? Let's check all A's on the board.\n\nRow 1, column 6: (1,6) is 'A' (from row 1: \"#   HSA#\" → column 6 is 'A').\n\nRow 2, column 2: (2,2) is 'A' (row 2: \"# A  S #\" → column 2 is 'A').\n\nRow 4, column 3: (4,3) is 'A' (row 4: \"#  ASSS#\" → column 3 is 'A').\n\nSo there are three apples at (1,6), (2,2), (4,3).\n\nThe snake's head is at (1,4). Let's see the positions:\n\nIf moving LEFT (to (1,3)), then next positions. Let's see possible future moves. Maybe moving towards an apple.\n\nAlternatively, if moving DOWN to (2,4), then next possible moves. Let's think about the snake's path. The current body is in positions (1,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). So if the snake moves DOWN to (2,4), then the next direction options would be DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (but can't reverse from DOWN, so can't go UP). But let's see if moving DOWN allows the snake to approach an apple.\n\nThe apple at (2,2) is in row 2, column 2. So if the snake is at (2,4), moving left (column 3, then 2) could reach that apple. But need to check the path.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now (to (1,3)), then next possible directions could be LEFT (again, to (1,2)), which is in row 1, column 2. Let's check (1,2): it's a space (row 1: \"#   HSA#\" → column 2 is ' '). Then (1,1) would be next (column 1), which is also space. Then (1,0) is a wall (column 0 is '#'), so can't go there.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,3), then next direction could be DOWN (from (1,3) moving down to (2,3)), which is in row 2, column 3 (row 2, column 3 is ' ' (row 2: \"# A  S #\", column 3 is ' '). Then from (2,3), moving left to (2,2), which is the apple (A at (2,2)). So that's a possible path. So moving LEFT now, then DOWN, then LEFT would reach that apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we move DOWN now to (2,4), then next direction could be LEFT (since current direction would be DOWN, can't reverse to UP). So from (2,4), moving LEFT to (2,3) (space), then LEFT to (2,2) (apple). That's a shorter path. Because moving DOWN to (2,4), then LEFT twice would reach (2,2) in two steps. Let's check:\n\nCurrent direction after moving DOWN is DOWN. So next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (2,4), then next move direction could be LEFT. Then head moves to (2,3) (safe). Then next move direction LEFT again (current direction is LEFT), moving to (2,2), which is the apple. So that would be two steps to reach the apple. That's better.\n\nBut let's check if there's any collision in that path. Let's think:\n\nCurrent body positions (excluding head) are (1,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n\nIf we move DOWN to (2,4), the new body positions would be:\n\nHead: (2,4)\n\nBody segments:\n\n(1,4) (old head), (1,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). Because the snake's length is 8, so when moving, the tail (4,6) would move to (4,5), (4,5) to (4,4), (4,4) to (3,6), (3,6) to (3,5), (3,5) to (2,6), (2,6) to (1,5), (1,5) to (1,4). So the new body after moving DOWN would be (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n\nThen, if next move is LEFT (direction LEFT from current direction DOWN, which is allowed), the head moves to (2,3). Check (2,3): row 2, column 3 is ' ' (safe). The body would then shift, with (2,4) becoming body, etc. Then next move LEFT again (direction LEFT), head moves to (2,2) which is the apple (A). So eating that apple would grow the snake, increase the score.\n\nSo moving DOWN now allows reaching an apple in two steps, whereas moving LEFT might take longer.\n\nAnother apple is at (4,3). Let's see. The snake's current position is (1,4). To reach (4,3), the snake would need to move down a few rows and left. But that's a longer path. The apple at (1,6) is in row 1, column 6. The head is at (1,4). To reach (1,6), the snake would have to move right, but current direction is LEFT, and reversing to RIGHT is not allowed. So can't go right immediately. So (1,6) is probably not reachable soon.\n\nSo the best option is to move DOWN now, then LEFT to reach the apple at (2,2). So the direction to choose now is DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   HSA#\n# A  S #\n#    SS#\n#  ASSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake is currently moving LEFT, with its head at (row 1, column 4). The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). We evaluate the valid options (LEFT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### 1. UP:  \nMoving UP would take the head to (row 0, column 4), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). This causes an immediate collision, ending the game. **UP is invalid.**\n\n### 2. LEFT (current direction):  \nMoving LEFT takes the head to (row 1, column 3), which is empty (safe). However, this position contains no apple, and the path to nearby apples (e.g., (2,2)) would require additional steps.\n\n### 3. DOWN:  \nMoving DOWN changes direction to DOWN (allowed, as it is not the reverse of LEFT). The head moves to (row 2, column 4), which is empty (safe). From here, the snake can then turn LEFT twice to reach the apple at (row 2, column 2) in subsequent moves. This path is shorter and safer compared to continuing LEFT.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nDOWN is the best choice, as it avoids walls\/self-collision and positions the snake to reach an apple quickly.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #   SSA# → So positions (1,3), (1,4) are 'S' (body), (1,5) is 'A' (apple)\nRow 2: # A HS # → (2,1) 'A', (2,3) 'H' (head), (2,4) 'S' (body)\nRow 3: #    SS# → (3,4), (3,5) 'S'\nRow 4: #  A SS# → (4,2) 'A', (4,4), (4,5) 'S'\nRow 5: #      # → empty\nRow 6: #      # → empty\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. The head is at (2,3) (since row 2, column 3 is 'H'). Let's confirm the coordinates: rows are 0 to 7, columns 0 to 7. So (row, column) for H is (2,3). \n\nThe snake's body parts are 'S's. Let's list their positions to track the snake's length and avoid collision. From the board:\n\nRow 1: (1,3), (1,4) → S, S\nRow 2: (2,4) → S\nRow 3: (3,4), (3,5) → S, S\nRow 4: (4,4), (4,5) → S, S\n\nSo the body positions are (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5). The head is at (2,3). The snake's current length is 1 (head) + 7 (body) = 8. \n\nNow, the snake is moving DOWN. The next head position if direction remains DOWN would be (3,3). Let's check that square. Row 3 is \"#    SS#\", so (3,3) is empty (since row 3, columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: '#'). So (3,3) is ' '.\n\nBut we can change direction, but can't reverse. Current direction is DOWN, so the snake can't reverse to UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n\nLet's list possible directions and their next head positions:\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN. Possible directions (can't reverse to UP). So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n- DOWN: next head is (2+1, 3) = (3,3). Check if that's safe. (3,3) is ' ', not a wall (since row 3 is from 0 to 7, columns 0 and 6 are walls. (3,3) is within 1-5 columns, so not a wall. Also, (3,3) is not a body part (the body positions listed earlier don't include (3,3)). So moving DOWN is safe here.\n\n- LEFT: direction would be LEFT. Since current direction is DOWN, turning LEFT is allowed (not reverse). The next head position would be (2, 3-1) = (2,2). Let's check (2,2). Row 2 is \"# A HS #\". Columns: 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: '#'. So (2,2) is ' ', which is empty. No collision. So moving LEFT is possible.\n\n- RIGHT: direction is RIGHT. Next head position (2, 3+1) = (2,4). But (2,4) is 'S' (body part). That's a collision! So moving RIGHT would cause the snake to hit itself. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are DOWN, LEFT. Let's check if any of these positions have apples.\n\nCurrent apples on the board:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1, column 5: 'A' (1,5)\nRow 2, column 1: 'A' (2,1)\nRow 4, column 2: 'A' (4,2)\n\nSo apples are at (1,5), (2,1), (4,2).\n\nCheck next positions:\n\n- DOWN: (3,3) → no apple here. So snake moves there, body follows. Since no apple, the snake's length remains (since eating an apple increases length). The tail would move (since when not eating, the snake moves forward, so the tail (last body part) is removed, and head moves. So the body would shift, but no growth.\n\n- LEFT: (2,2) → no apple here (since (2,1) is 'A', (2,2) is ' '). So moving LEFT also doesn't eat an apple.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let's recheck the positions.\n\nWait, the head is at (2,3). Let's confirm row 2: \"# A HS #\". Let's split into characters:\n\nRow 2: index 0 is '#', 1 is 'A', 2 is ' ', 3 is 'H', 4 is 'S', 5 is ' ', 6 is '#'. So positions (row 2, column 1) is 'A', (row 2, column 3) is 'H', (row 2, column 4) is 'S'.\n\nSo (2,2) is ' ', correct. So moving LEFT would take head to (2,2), which is empty.\n\nWhat about the next move's safety beyond the immediate step? Since the game is only up to 100 epochs, but we need to avoid collision now.\n\nSo the possible directions are DOWN (next head (3,3)), LEFT (next head (2,2)), and RIGHT is invalid (collision with body).\n\nWe need to choose the direction that's safe and preferably leads towards apples. Let's see where the apples are.\n\nApples at (1,5), (2,1), (4,2). Let's see the current head position (2,3).\n\nDistance to (2,1): left 2 steps (from column 3 to 1). So moving LEFT would get closer to (2,1) apple.\n\nDistance to (4,2): down 2 rows (from row 2 to 4) and left 1 column (from 3 to 2). So (4,2) is down and left.\n\nDistance to (1,5): up 1 row (row 2 to 1) and right 2 columns (3 to 5). So (1,5) is up and right.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. Let's see possible paths.\n\nIf we go DOWN, head moves to (3,3). Then, next possible directions. Let's check (3,3) in row 3: \"#    SS#\" → (3,0) '#', (3,1) ' ', (3,2) ' ', (3,3) ' ', (3,4) 'S', (3,5) 'S', (3,6) '#'. So (3,3) is safe. From (3,3), possible directions (since current direction would be DOWN, so next direction can't be UP. So directions could be LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. Let's see (3,3) adjacent squares:\n\n- DOWN: (4,3). Row 4 is \"#  A SS#\" → (4,0) '#', (4,1) ' ', (4,2) 'A', (4,3) ' ', (4,4) 'S', (4,5) 'S', (4,6) '#'. So (4,3) is ' ', safe.\n\n- LEFT: (3,2). Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (3,4) → 'S' (body). So can't go right.\n\nSo from (3,3), moving DOWN would take to (4,3), which is near (4,2) apple (column 2). So (4,3) is adjacent to (4,2) (left 1). So if next direction is LEFT from (4,3), head would go to (4,2), which is an apple. That would be good.\n\nAlternatively, if we go LEFT now (from (2,3) to (2,2)), then next head position (2,2). Let's check that square. (2,2) is ' ', safe. Then, possible directions (current direction would be LEFT, so can't reverse to RIGHT. So directions could be UP, DOWN, LEFT). Let's see:\n\nFrom (2,2), possible next moves:\n\n- UP: (1,2). Row 1 is \"#   SSA#\" → (1,0) '#', (1,1) ' ', (1,2) ' ', (1,3) 'S', (1,4) 'S', (1,5) 'A', (1,6) '#'. So (1,2) is ' ', safe. (1,2) is adjacent to (1,5) apple (right 3 columns). \n\n- DOWN: (3,2). Which is ' ', safe. (3,2) is adjacent to (4,2) apple (down 1 row). \n\n- LEFT: (2,1). Which is 'A'! Oh, (2,1) is an apple. So if after moving LEFT to (2,2), then moving LEFT again (since direction is LEFT), the next head position would be (2,1), which is an apple. That's a good move. Because moving LEFT now (to (2,2)), then next direction LEFT would take head to (2,1) (apple), which would be eaten, increasing the score and growing the snake.\n\nSo let's map this:\n\nCurrent head (2,3). Current direction is DOWN.\n\nIf we choose LEFT direction now:\n\n- Next head position: (2, 3-1) = (2,2). Check if (2,2) is safe. It's ' ', yes. No collision. \n\nAfter moving LEFT, the snake's new head is (2,2). The body parts would shift. The previous head (2,3) becomes part of the body. The tail (the last 'S' in the body) would be removed if no apple is eaten. Since (2,2) is not an apple, the snake's length remains the same. The body now includes (2,3), and the tail (which was (4,5) perhaps) is removed. But the exact body positions might change, but for the next step, the important thing is the next move.\n\nThen, in the next epoch (epoch 19), the direction could be LEFT again (since current direction would be LEFT, can't reverse to RIGHT). The next head position would be (2, 2-1) = (2,1), which is the apple at (2,1). That would be a good move because eating that apple would increase the score and the snake would grow.\n\nSo choosing LEFT now allows the snake to reach an apple in the next move. That's better than moving DOWN, which may take longer to reach an apple.\n\nSo the best direction to choose now is LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#   SSA#\n# A HS #\n#    SS#\n#  A SS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 2, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN (snake cannot reverse to UP).\n- **Possible Directions**: LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since reversing to UP is invalid).\n- **Collision Checks**:\n  - **RIGHT**: Next head position would be (2, 4), which is occupied by 'S' (snake's body). Collision occurs → invalid.\n  - **DOWN**: Next head position is (3, 3), which is empty (' '). No collision → safe.\n  - **LEFT**: Next head position is (2, 2), which is empty (' '). No collision → safe.\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1, 5), (2, 1), and (4, 2).\n\n### Strategy:\n- Moving RIGHT is invalid (collision with body).\n- Moving DOWN to (3, 3) is safe but does not lead directly to an apple.\n- Moving LEFT to (2, 2) is safe and positions the snake to reach the apple at (2, 1) in the next move (by continuing LEFT). This allows the snake to eat an apple and grow, which is optimal.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by analyzing the given game board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#'. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #   SSA# → So positions (1,3), (1,4) are 'S' (body), (1,5) is 'A' (apple)\nRow 2: # AHSS # → Let's check the columns. The row starts with '#', then space, 'A', 'H', 'S', 'S', space, '#'. So columns 1 is space, 2 is 'A', 3 is 'H' (head), 4 and 5 are 'S', 6 is space, 7 is '#'. So head is at (2,3).\nRow 3: #    SS# → Columns 4 and 5 are 'S' (body)\nRow 4: #  A  S# → Column 3 is 'A', column 6 is 'S' (body)\nRow 5: #      # → All spaces\nRow 6: #      # → All spaces\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. Let's confirm the snake's body positions. The head is at (2,3). Since direction is LEFT, the next move would be to (2,2), because moving left decreases the column index by 1.\n\nWait, let's track the snake's body. The snake's body parts are 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,3), (1,4)\nRow 2: (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3: (3,4), (3,5)\nRow 4: (4,6)\nSo the head is at (2,3). Let's think about the snake's body order. The snake's movement: when moving, the head moves to a new position, and each body part follows the previous one. So the current body positions are in the order of the snake's path.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So the head is moving left. The current head is at (2,3). Moving left would take it to (2,2). Let's check (2,2) on the board. Looking at row 2: \"# AHSS #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: 'H', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (2,2) is 'A' (apple). So if the snake moves LEFT, the head would go to (2,2), which is an apple. Eating that apple would make the snake grow. The new head position is (2,2), and the body would extend. The previous head (2,3) becomes 'S', and the rest of the body follows.\n\nBut we need to check if moving LEFT is possible. The snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is LEFT. The possible directions the player can input are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, but can't reverse. Reversing would be if the current direction is LEFT, the reverse is RIGHT. So the player can't choose RIGHT. So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nWait, the rules say: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So if current direction is LEFT, the snake can't turn to RIGHT. So possible directions to choose are LEFT (continue), UP, or DOWN.\n\nNow, the current head is at (2,3). Let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT: next position (2,2). That's an 'A' (apple). So eating it, score increases. The new head is (2,2). The body will follow. The previous positions (2,3) becomes 'S', then (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,6), (1,3), (1,4) — all the body parts shift. No collision here because (2,2) is not a wall (since row 2 is within 0-7, column 2 is 2, which is between 0 and 7, so not a wall. Also, (2,2) is 'A', not 'S', so no self-collision. So this is safe.\n\n2. UP: current direction is LEFT. Turning UP is allowed (not reverse). UP direction would mean the head moves to (1,3). Let's check (1,3). Looking at row 1: \"#   SSA#\", columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'A', 6: '#'. So (1,3) is 'S' (body part). So moving UP would make the head go into the body, causing a collision. Game over. So UP is invalid.\n\n3. DOWN: direction is DOWN. The head would move to (3,3). Let's check row 3: \"#    SS#\", columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: '#'. So (3,3) is a space (no 'S' or wall). So moving DOWN to (3,3) is possible. But is there a better option? Let's check if there's an apple in that direction. (3,3) is empty, so no apple. But moving LEFT gives an apple, which is better for score.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT. Because moving LEFT leads to eating an apple, increasing the score, and no collision. UP is collision with body. DOWN is safe but no apple. So the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   SSA#\n# AHSS #\n#    SS#\n#  A  S#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,3) (row 2, column 3), and it is currently moving LEFT. The possible directions to choose are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (since reversing direction to RIGHT is not allowed). \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (2,2), which is an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision) and would result in eating the apple, increasing the score.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (1,3), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'), causing a collision and ending the game.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (3,3), which is empty (no apple, no collision).  \n\nThe best choice is to move LEFT to eat the apple and avoid collision. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8 with walls as '#'. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A  SSA# → So positions (1,1)=A, (1,4)=S, (1,5)=S, (1,6)=A\nRow 2: # HSSS # → (2,1)=space, (2,2)=H (head), (2,3)=S, (2,4)=S, (2,5)=S, (2,6)=space\nRow 3: #    SS# → (3,1)=space, (3,2)=space, (3,3)=space, (3,4)=S, (3,5)=S, (3,6)=space\nRow 4: #  A  S# → (4,1)=space, (4,2)=space, (4,3)=A, (4,4)=space, (4,5)=S, (4,6)=space\nRow 5: #      # → all spaces except walls\nRow 6: #      # → all spaces except walls\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. The snake's head is at (2,2) (row 2, column 2). Since direction is LEFT, the next position the head would move to is (2,1), because moving left decreases the column index by 1. Let's check what's at (2,1). Looking at row 2: \"# HSSS #\", so (2,1) is a space. So if the snake continues moving LEFT, the head moves to (2,1). \n\nBut wait, we need to consider the snake's body. The body is made of 'S's. Let's list the positions of the snake's body segments. The head is H at (2,2). Then, the body segments are the S's connected. Let's track the snake's body:\n\nRow 2: (2,2)=H, (2,3)=S, (2,4)=S, (2,5)=S → these are consecutive, so the next part is (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). Then row 1 has (1,4)=S, (1,5)=S. Row 3 has (3,4)=S, (3,5)=S. Row 4 has (4,5)=S. So let's list all S positions:\n\nHead: (2,2)\nBody: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) → Let's check if that's connected. Let's see, from head (2,2), moving in current direction LEFT. The previous direction before current (LEFT) would determine the body's position. But maybe it's easier to list all S positions. So all S and H positions are:\n\n(2,2) H\n(2,3) S\n(2,4) S\n(2,5) S\n(1,4) S\n(1,5) S\n(3,4) S\n(3,5) S\n(4,5) S\n\nNow, the current direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction. So possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT (since reversing would be RIGHT, which is not allowed). Because the current direction is LEFT, the snake can't turn RIGHT (since that's a 180-degree turn, which is reversing). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nWe need to check each possible direction to see if moving in that direction would cause a collision (with walls or itself) and also if it can reach an apple.\n\nFirst, let's check the current direction (LEFT). The next head position would be (2,1). Let's check (2,1). The cell is a space (from row 2: \"# HSSS #\", so (2,0) is '#', (2,1) is ' ', (2,2) is H). So (2,1) is empty. So moving LEFT would take the head to (2,1). Then, the rest of the body moves. Since the snake's length is the number of S's plus H. Let's count: H is 1, S's are 8 (from the list above: 2,3; 2,4; 2,5; 1,4; 1,5; 3,4; 3,5; 4,5 → 8 S's). So length is 9. So when moving, the head moves to (2,1), and the tail (the last S) would move only if the snake doesn't eat an apple. Wait, the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since (2,1) is a space (no apple), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail (the last S) would be removed. The last S is (4,5), so after moving, that S would be removed. So the new body would be (2,2) (old head becomes S), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (3,5). The new head is (2,1). So moving LEFT is safe here.\n\nNext, check direction UP. Current head is (2,2). Moving UP would take it to (1,2). Let's check (1,2). Row 1 is \"#A  SSA#\". So (1,0) is '#', (1,1)=A, (1,2)= ' ', (1,3)= ' ', (1,4)=S, (1,5)=S, (1,6)=A. So (1,2) is a space. Is there any S in (1,2)? No. So moving UP to (1,2) is possible. Now, check if that's a wall: (1,2) is within the board (rows 1-6 are inside, columns 1-6). So no wall collision. Now, check if (1,2) is a body part. The current body parts are the S's listed earlier. (1,2) is not in the body positions, so no self-collision. So moving UP is safe.\n\nThen, check direction DOWN. Current head is (2,2). Moving DOWN would take it to (3,2). Let's check (3,2). Row 3 is \"#    SS#\". So (3,0)='#', (3,1)= ' ', (3,2)= ' ', (3,3)= ' ', (3,4)=S, (3,5)=S, (3,6)= ' '. So (3,2) is a space. Check if (3,2) is a body part. The body positions are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). (3,2) is not among them, so no collision. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nNow, the possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. We need to choose which one is best, preferably leading to an apple.\n\nLet's check where the apples are. The apples are 'A's on the board. Let's list their positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1)=A, (1,6)=A\nRow 4: (4,3)=A\n\nSo apples at (1,1), (1,6), (4,3).\n\nThe current head is at (2,2). Let's see which direction gets closer to an apple.\n\nIf moving LEFT: new head (2,1). (2,1) is adjacent to (1,1) (which is A). (2,1) is one cell down from (1,1). So from (2,1), the snake could move UP next to reach (1,1) (the apple). So moving LEFT now, then UP next would get the apple.\n\nIf moving UP: new head (1,2). (1,2) is adjacent to (1,1) (A) on the left. So from (1,2), moving LEFT would reach (1,1) (apple). That's a good path.\n\nIf moving DOWN: new head (3,2). The apple at (4,3) is down and right from (3,2). So (3,2) → (4,2) → (4,3) (apple). So moving DOWN then DOWN then RIGHT could reach that apple.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if any of the directions would immediately hit an apple. Let's check the next positions for each direction:\n\n- LEFT: (2,1) → no apple (since (1,1) is A, (2,1) is space)\n- UP: (1,2) → no apple (row 1, column 2 is space)\n- DOWN: (3,2) → no apple (row 3, column 2 is space)\n\nSo none of the next moves would eat an apple. So the next step is to choose a direction that leads towards an apple and avoids collision in the next steps.\n\nLet's think about the snake's body positions. The snake's body is in a somewhat complex shape. Let's consider possible paths.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. If we continue LEFT, head moves to (2,1). Then the next possible directions would be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again (can't go RIGHT). From (2,1), moving UP would go to (1,1), which is an apple. That's perfect. So moving LEFT now, then UP next would get the apple at (1,1). That's a good path.\n\nIf we choose UP now, head moves to (1,2). Then the next direction could be LEFT (since current direction would be UP, so can't go DOWN, but can go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP). From (1,2), moving LEFT (column 1) would reach (1,1), which is the apple. So that's also a good path. So moving UP now, then LEFT next would get the apple.\n\nIf we choose DOWN now, head moves to (3,2). Then, possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since current direction would be DOWN, can't go UP). From (3,2), moving DOWN to (4,2), then RIGHT to (4,3) (apple). That's another path, but perhaps longer.\n\nBut we need to check if any of these paths are blocked by the snake's body.\n\nLet's check moving LEFT first:\n\nCurrent head (2,2) → move LEFT to (2,1). Then next possible direction is UP to (1,1). (1,1) is A. Let's check if (1,1) is accessible. (1,1) is an apple. So moving LEFT then UP would get the apple. What's the body's position after moving LEFT once? The body after moving LEFT would be:\n\nOld head (2,2) becomes S. The body segments shift: (2,3) → (2,2), (2,4) → (2,3), (2,5) → (2,4), (1,4) → (2,5), (1,5) → (1,4), (3,4) → (1,5), (3,5) → (3,4), (4,5) → (3,5). Then the tail (4,5) is removed because no apple was eaten. So the new body positions after moving LEFT would be:\n\nHead: (2,1)\nBody: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nSo when moving UP from (2,1) to (1,1), is (1,1) in the body? The body positions are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (3,5). (1,1) is not among them, so safe.\n\nNow, moving UP now: head (2,2) → (1,2). The body after moving UP would be:\n\nOld head (2,2) becomes S. The body shifts: (2,3) → (2,2), (2,4) → (2,3), (2,5) → (2,4), (1,4) → (2,5), (1,5) → (1,4), (3,4) → (1,5), (3,5) → (3,4), (4,5) → (3,5). Tail (4,5) is removed. So new body positions:\n\nHead: (1,2)\nBody: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nThen, moving LEFT from (1,2) to (1,1). (1,1) is A. Check if (1,1) is in the body. The body is (2,2), (2,3), etc. So (1,1) is safe. So that's also a valid path.\n\nMoving DOWN: head (2,2) → (3,2). Body after moving DOWN:\n\nOld head (2,2) becomes S. Body shifts similarly. New body positions:\n\nHead: (3,2)\nBody: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nThen moving DOWN again to (4,2). Then moving RIGHT to (4,3) (apple). (4,3) is an apple, and (4,2) is space. So that's possible.\n\nNow, which direction is better? Let's see the current apples. The apple at (1,1) is the closest. Let's see the distance from the head (2,2) to (1,1): that's 1 up and 1 left (Manhattan distance 2). If we move LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (1,1) (distance 1). If we move UP to (1,2), then LEFT to (1,1) (distance 1). Either way, two steps to reach the apple.\n\nBut what about the snake's body blocking the path. Let's check for possible collisions in the next steps.\n\nIf we choose LEFT now, next step direction could be UP. Let's imagine that. After moving LEFT, the head is at (2,1). The body includes (2,2), (2,3), etc. So moving UP to (1,1) is safe.\n\nIf we choose UP now, then moving LEFT next, the head is at (1,2). The body includes (2,2), (2,3), etc. So moving LEFT to (1,1) is safe.\n\nEither direction (LEFT or UP) can reach the apple in two steps. What about the other direction, DOWN? The apple at (4,3) is further. Manhattan distance from (2,2) to (4,3) is (4-2)+(3-2)=2+1=3. So three steps. So the closer apples are (1,1) and (1,6). Let's check (1,6): (1,6) is A. The head is (2,2). Manhattan distance to (1,6) is (1-2)+(6-2) = 1 +4=5. So that's further.\n\nSo the best option is to go for the closest apple, (1,1). So the question is, which direction (LEFT or UP) is better.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the current direction. The snake is moving LEFT. If we choose to continue LEFT, the movement is straightforward. If we choose UP, that's a turn, but allowed (since current direction is LEFT, turning UP is allowed; can't reverse to RIGHT).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving UP now would allow the snake to reach the apple (1,1) in the next move. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head (2,2). If we move UP to (1,2), then the next direction can be LEFT (since current direction would be UP, and can't go DOWN, but can go LEFT). So from (1,2), moving LEFT to (1,1) (apple). That's two steps. Similarly, moving LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (1,1) is two steps.\n\nBut let's check if there's any immediate danger. For example, if the snake's body is blocking any direction.\n\nIn the current board, the snake's body is in positions that don't block the possible directions. So all three directions (LEFT, UP, DOWN) are safe.\n\nBut the question is, which direction to choose. Since the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, we should choose the direction that leads to the nearest apple.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is the nearest. Let's think about the path. If the snake moves UP now, then LEFT next, that's a more direct path. Let's see: (2,2) → UP to (1,2) → LEFT to (1,1) (apple). That's two moves. Alternatively, (2,2) → LEFT to (2,1) → UP to (1,1). Also two moves.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP is better because moving LEFT might take the snake towards the wall (column 0 is a wall). (2,1) is column 1. If the snake continues LEFT, next would be column 0 (wall), which is a collision. So after moving LEFT to (2,1), the next direction can't be LEFT again (since (2,0) is a wall). So after moving LEFT, the next direction must be UP or DOWN. So moving UP from (2,1) is necessary. Which is exactly the path to the apple.\n\nSo either direction (UP or LEFT) is acceptable, but perhaps moving UP is better because it's a more open area. Alternatively, let's check if the snake's body is in the way of any direction.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when the snake moves, the tail is removed only if it doesn't eat an apple. So in the current scenario, none of the next moves will eat an apple, so the tail (current (4,5)) will be removed. So after moving, the snake's length remains the same (since no apple eaten), and the tail is (3,5) instead of (4,5).\n\nBut perhaps the best choice here is to move UP. Because moving UP might give more space. Let's see:\n\nIf we move UP, the new head is (1,2). The body is now (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (3,5). The area around (1,2) is (1,1)=A (apple), (1,3)= ' ', (0,2) is a wall (row 0 is top wall). So from (1,2), the possible directions are LEFT (to (1,1), apple), RIGHT (to (1,3)), or UP (wall, so invalid). So moving LEFT from (1,2) would get the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we move LEFT, new head (2,1). The area around (2,1) is (1,1)=A (apple), (3,1)= ' ', (2,0)=wall. So possible directions are UP (to (1,1)), DOWN (to (3,1)), or LEFT (wall, invalid). So moving UP from (2,1) would get the apple.\n\nBoth paths are valid. So which direction to choose? The problem says to choose one of the directions. Since the current direction is LEFT, and the snake can't reverse, but can turn UP or DOWN.\n\nBut perhaps the best answer is UP. Because moving UP allows the snake to position itself to the left of the apple (1,1) in the next step. Alternatively, maybe LEFT is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a collision I'm missing. Let me double-check.\n\nCurrent head at (2,2). If direction is UP, new head is (1,2). Check (1,2): is that a body part? The body parts are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). (1,2) is not in there, so safe.\n\nIf direction is DOWN, new head (3,2). (3,2) is not a body part, safe.\n\nIf direction is LEFT, new head (2,1). (2,1) is not a body part, safe.\n\nSo all three directions are safe. So the choice is which direction leads to the apple fastest. Since both UP and LEFT can reach the apple in two steps, but perhaps the answer is UP. Or maybe the example given in the problem can help. In the example, when the direction was DOWN, the snake ate an apple. So perhaps the answer here is UP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple at (4,3) is another target. Let's see. The head is (2,2). To reach (4,3), the snake would need to move DOWN twice and RIGHT once. Let's see: (2,2) → DOWN to (3,2) → DOWN to (4,2) → RIGHT to (4,3). That's three steps. So that's possible, but longer.\n\nSo the best option is to go for the nearest apple, (1,1). So either UP or LEFT. But which is better?\n\nLet's think about the snake's current body. The body is in (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). So the snake is kind of forming a U-shape. The head is at (2,2), and the body extends to the right (2,3,4,5), then up (1,4,5) and down (3,4,5; 4,5). So the area to the left of the head (columns 0 and 1) is mostly empty, except for (1,1)=A. The area above the head (row 1) has (1,1)=A and (1,6)=A. The area below (row 3,4) has some S's but also space.\n\nIf we move UP, the snake's head is at (1,2), which is in row 1. That row has (1,1)=A (left) and (1,6)=A (right). So from (1,2), moving left gets the apple, which is better.\n\nIf we move LEFT, the head is at (2,1), which is in row 2. From there, moving up gets the apple at (1,1).\n\nBoth are good. But perhaps the answer is UP. Because moving UP might be a better direction to avoid the body in the future. Alternatively, the problem may expect the direction that allows the snake to reach the apple in the next move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if any direction would cause a collision in the next step. But all directions are safe.\n\nHmm. Since the problem says to choose one of the directions, and all are safe, perhaps the best answer is UP. Or maybe LEFT. But I need to decide.\n\nWait, let's think about the current direction. The snake is moving LEFT. The next move is direction input. The snake's movement is in the direction given. So if the current direction is LEFT, and we choose UP, the snake turns UP. The movement would be one square UP from the current head. So the head moves from (2,2) to (1,2). That's allowed.\n\nYes, I think UP is a good choice here.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A  SSA#\n# HSSS #\n#    SS#\n#  A  S#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,2) (row 2, column 2), moving LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n1. **LEFT**: The head moves to (2,1) (a space, no collision). This is safe but does not reach an apple immediately. From (2,1), the next move could be UP to reach the apple at (1,1) in the following step.  \n2. **UP**: The head moves to (1,2) (a space, no collision). This is safe. From (1,2), the next move could be LEFT to reach the apple at (1,1) directly in the following step.  \n3. **DOWN**: The head moves to (3,2) (a space, no collision). This is safe but leads away from the nearest apple (1,1) and requires more steps to reach the apple at (4,3).  \n\n### Best choice:\nThe nearest apples are at (1,1) and (1,6). Moving UP allows the snake to position itself to reach the closest apple (1,1) in the next step (by turning LEFT from (1,2) to (1,1)). This path is direct and avoids unnecessary detours.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #AH SSA# (positions 1-6: A, H, space, S, S, A)\nRow 2: # SSSS # (positions 1-6: space, S, S, S, S, space)\nRow 3: #    SS# (positions 1-6: space, space, space, space, S, S)\nRow 4: #  A   # (positions 1-6: space, space, A, space, space, space)\nRow 5: #      # (positions 1-6: all spaces)\nRow 6: #      # (positions 1-6: all spaces)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe snake's head is 'H' in row 1, column 1 (since row indices start at 0, and columns too). Let's confirm the position: row 1 (second row) has \"#AH SSA#\", so index 1 (since the first character is '#', which is column 0) is 'A' at column 1, then 'H' at column 2. Wait, let's index each row properly.\n\nLet's list each cell with coordinates (row, column):\n\nRow 0: columns 0-7 are all '#', so walls.\nRow 1:\n0: # (wall)\n1: A (apple)\n2: H (head)\n3:  (space)\n4: S (body)\n5: S (body)\n6: A (apple)\n7: # (wall)\nRow 2:\n0: # (wall)\n1:  (space)\n2: S (body)\n3: S (body)\n4: S (body)\n5: S (body)\n6:  (space)\n7: # (wall)\nRow 3:\n0: # (wall)\n1:  (space)\n2:  (space)\n3:  (space)\n4:  (space)\n5: S (body)\n6: S (body)\n7: # (wall)\nRow 4:\n0: # (wall)\n1:  (space)\n2:  (space)\n3: A (apple)\n4:  (space)\n5:  (space)\n6:  (space)\n7: # (wall)\nRow 5:\n0: # (wall)\n1:  (space)\n2:  (space)\n3:  (space)\n4:  (space)\n5:  (space)\n6:  (space)\n7: # (wall)\nRow 6:\n0: # (wall)\n1:  (space)\n2:  (space)\n3:  (space)\n4:  (space)\n5:  (space)\n6:  (space)\n7: # (wall)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at (1,2). The current direction is UP. The snake's movement direction is UP, so the next position the head would move to is (row-1, column) because moving UP decreases the row index. The current head is at row 1, column 2. Moving UP would take it to row 0, column 2. But row 0 is a wall (all '#'), so that's a collision with the wall. That's bad, so we can't keep moving UP. The snake can't reverse direction, so from UP, the snake can't go DOWN (since that's reverse). So possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check the possible directions. The snake's current direction is UP, so the possible new directions are LEFT, RIGHT (since UP is current, and you can't reverse to DOWN).\n\nFirst, let's check if moving LEFT is possible. Moving LEFT would mean the direction changes to LEFT. The head's next position would be (row, column-1). The current head is (1,2), so column-1 is 1. So next position (1,1). What's at (1,1)? Looking at row 1, column 1 is 'A' (apple). So if the snake moves LEFT, it would go to (1,1), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple increases the score and the snake grows. Also, (1,1) is not a wall, and not part of the snake's body (since the body parts are 'S's). Let's check the body positions:\n\nBody 'S's are in row 1, columns 4 and 5 (row 1: #AH SSA# → columns 4 and 5 are S). Then row 2 has S's in columns 2,3,4,5. Row 3 has S's in columns 5,6. So (1,1) is an apple, not a body part. So moving LEFT would be safe. The new head position is (1,1), which is an apple. Then the snake would grow, so the body would extend. The previous head (1,2) becomes a body part (S), and the new head is (1,1) (now H). The apple at (1,1) is eaten, so that cell becomes H, and a new apple would be generated (but the example shows that when you eat an apple, the next state has the head in the apple's position, and the previous head becomes S). So that's safe.\n\nNow check moving RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would change direction to RIGHT. The next head position is (1,3) (current head (1,2), column+1=3). What's at (1,3)? It's a space (row 1, column 3 is ' '). So that's a valid position. Is (1,3) part of the snake's body? Let's check: the body is S's. The S's in row 1 are columns 4 and 5, row 2 columns 2-5, row 3 columns 5-6. So (1,3) is a space, not a body part. So moving RIGHT would be safe. The head moves to (1,3), which is empty. The previous head (1,2) becomes S, and the rest of the body shifts.\n\nBut we need to check if moving LEFT or RIGHT leads to a better outcome, perhaps avoiding future collisions. Let's think about the snake's body positions. The current body is:\n\nRow 1, columns 4,5 (S,S)\nRow 2, columns 2,3,4,5 (S,S,S,S)\nRow 3, columns 5,6 (S,S)\n\nSo the body forms a sort of trail. The snake's length can be calculated by counting the S's and H. H is 1, S's are 2 (row1) +4 (row2)+2 (row3) = 8, so total length 9. So the snake is 9 units long.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (1,1): that's an apple, so we get a point. The next head is (1,1), which is safe. The next direction would be LEFT (since that's the direction we moved). Then, the next move would be LEFT again, which would take the head to (1,0), but (1,0) is a wall (column 0 is '#'). So that's a problem. Wait, (1,0) is a wall. So after moving LEFT once, if the next direction is LEFT again, the head would go to (1,0) which is a wall, causing a collision. But perhaps after moving LEFT, the next move could be adjusted. But in the current step, we need to choose the direction that's safe now.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (1,3), which is a space. Then the next possible directions would be RIGHT (current direction would be RIGHT), or UP (but wait, the current direction after moving RIGHT would be RIGHT, so the next move can't reverse direction. So from RIGHT, the snake can turn UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT, but can't go LEFT (reverse). Wait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, the example says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Oh, perhaps the reverse is when the new direction is the opposite of the current. So, for example, if current direction is UP, the snake can't turn to DOWN (reverse). If current direction is LEFT, can't turn to RIGHT, etc. So when the current direction is UP, the possible directions are UP (continue), LEFT, RIGHT. Because DOWN is reverse.\n\nSo in the current scenario, current direction is UP. So possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because DOWN is reverse. But moving UP now would take the head to (0,2), which is a wall (row 0, column 2 is '#'), so that's a collision. So UP is invalid. So the options are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nSo, moving LEFT: head goes to (1,1), which is an apple. That's good. No collision. The next direction would be LEFT (since we chose LEFT). Then, the next move (epoch 22) would be in direction LEFT. The head would be at (1,1), moving LEFT to (1,0), which is a wall. So that would be a collision. So that's a problem. But perhaps we can adjust direction in the next step, but the current step is epoch 21, and we need to choose the direction for this move. The game hasn't ended yet. So in this step, moving LEFT is safe (no collision now), and we get an apple.\n\nMoving RIGHT: head goes to (1,3). That's a space. No collision. Then, the next direction could be RIGHT, UP, or DOWN (since current direction would be RIGHT, so reverse is LEFT, which is not allowed). But moving RIGHT again would take the head to (1,4), which is S (row 1, column 4 is S). So (1,4) is part of the snake's body. So if the direction after moving RIGHT is RIGHT again, the next head position (1,4) would collide with the body. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT (current direction becomes RIGHT), the next possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Let's see:\n\nIf after moving RIGHT (epoch 21), the head is at (1,3). Then, in epoch 22, if direction is UP, the head would move to (0,3) (row 0 is wall), collision. If direction is DOWN, the head moves to (2,3). What's at (2,3)? Row 2, column 3 is S (row 2: # SSSS # → columns 2-5 are S, so column 3 is S). So (2,3) is S, collision. If direction is RIGHT, head moves to (1,4), which is S (row 1, column 4 is S). So collision. So moving RIGHT now would lead to a collision in the next step.\n\nHmm. So moving LEFT now would get an apple, but next step might hit a wall. But perhaps there's another way. Let's recheck the positions.\n\nCurrent head is (1,2). Current direction is UP.\n\nIf we move LEFT (direction LEFT), next head position (1,1) (which is A). That's safe. The body would shift: the previous head (1,2) becomes S, and the rest of the body follows. So the body after moving LEFT would have:\n\nNew head: (1,1) (H)\nBody segments: (1,2) (S), (1,4) (S), (1,5) (S), (2,2) (S), (2,3) (S), (2,4) (S), (2,5) (S), (3,5) (S), (3,6) (S) → because when the snake moves, the body follows. Wait, the snake's body is a sequence. The head moves, then each body part moves to the position of the previous part. So the original body is:\n\nAssuming the snake's body is in order: the head is (1,2). The next body part is (1,4) (since row 1 has H at 2, then space at 3, then S at 4). Then (1,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2?), wait, maybe I need to reconstruct the snake's body path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snake's body is a contiguous path. Let's try to trace the body:\n\nHead at (1,2). The body is S's. Let's see adjacent S's. Let's check the positions of S's:\n\nRow 1: columns 4,5 (S,S)\nRow 2: columns 2,3,4,5 (S,S,S,S)\nRow 3: columns 5,6 (S,S)\n\nSo, possible body path: Let's see. The head is (1,2). The next body part would be where? The snake moves in direction UP, so the previous position (before the last move) would be in the direction opposite to UP, which is DOWN. So the head was moving UP, so the previous head position was (2,2). Because moving UP from (2,2) to (1,2) (current head). So (2,2) is the next body part. Then (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (3,5), (3,6). Let's confirm:\n\nIf the snake was moving UP, the head was at (2,2) in the previous step. Then moved UP to (1,2) (current head). So (2,2) is now S (body). Then the body after that would be (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (3,5), (3,6). That makes sense because row 2 has S's in columns 2-5, which would be consecutive. So the body sequence is:\n\nHead (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (1,4) → (3,5) → (3,6).\n\nSo the length is 9 (head + 8 body parts).\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT (direction LEFT) now, the new head is (1,1). The body parts would shift: the previous head (1,2) becomes the first body part, followed by (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (3,5), (3,6). So the new body positions would be (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (3,5), (3,6). The new head is (1,1). Now, (1,1) is an apple, so the snake eats it, grows by one, so the body length increases by one. Wait, when the snake eats an apple, it grows in length, which means the tail doesn't move (the tail stays, and the body adds a new segment). So in normal movement, the snake moves forward, the head moves to a new position, and each body part follows the previous one, and the tail is removed. But when it eats an apple, the tail is not removed, so the length increases by one.\n\nSo, in the example given:\n\nOriginal board:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nDirection DOWN. The head was at (3,1) (row 3, column 1). Moving DOWN to (4,1). (4,1) is A. So the head moves there, eats the apple. The previous head (3,1) becomes S. The body was (2,1) (S). So the new body is (3,1) (S), (2,1) (S). The tail (if any) would not be removed. So the example's new board has:\n\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nWhich shows the head at (4,1) (H), the previous head (3,1) as S, and (2,1) as S, so the length increased by 1.\n\nSo, when the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't get cut; the body just adds the previous head position. So in our current case, moving LEFT to (1,1) (A), the head moves there. The previous head (1,2) becomes S. The rest of the body shifts as usual, but since it's an apple, the tail (the last S) remains. So the snake's length increases by 1.\n\nSo, moving LEFT is safe now. The next position is (1,1), which is an apple. No collision with walls or body.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1,3): that's a space. The head moves there. The previous head (1,2) becomes S. The body shifts, and the tail (the last S) is removed (since no apple was eaten). So the length remains the same. Then, the next direction could be... but let's see if (1,3) is safe. (1,3) is a space, not a wall, not a body part. So that's okay. But what's the next move? Let's say after moving RIGHT, the current direction is RIGHT. Then the next move could be RIGHT (direction RIGHT), which would take the head to (1,4). (1,4) is S (body part). So collision. If direction is UP, head moves to (0,3) (wall). If direction is DOWN, head moves to (2,3), which is S (body part). So all options for next move would cause collision. So moving RIGHT now would lead to a loss in the next step.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now: head at (1,1) (A), which is safe. The next direction could be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since current direction is LEFT, so reverse is RIGHT). Wait, after moving LEFT, the current direction is LEFT, so the next possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN (since RIGHT is reverse). Let's see. The head is at (1,1) (after moving LEFT). Next possible directions:\n\n- LEFT: move to (1,0) (wall, collision)\n- UP: move to (0,1) (wall, collision)\n- DOWN: move to (2,1). What's (2,1)? Row 2, column 1 is space (row 2: # SSSS # → column 1 is space). So (2,1) is a space. So if after moving LEFT (epoch 21), in epoch 22, the direction is DOWN, the head would move to (2,1), which is safe. That's a possible path. So after moving LEFT (epoch 21), the next direction could be DOWN (since current direction is LEFT, and DOWN is allowed). So (2,1) is safe, and then proceed.\n\nSo moving LEFT now allows eating an apple, and then in the next step, turning DOWN to avoid walls. That's a better option than moving RIGHT, which would lead to a collision in the next step.\n\nSo the best direction to choose is LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#AH SSA#\n# SSSS #\n#    SS#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (1, 2) (row 1, column 2). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. The next possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT (UP would collide with the top wall at row 0). \n\n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (1, 1), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake. After this move, the new head is at (1, 1), and the previous head (1, 2) becomes a body segment ('S'). \n\n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (1, 3), a space. However, the next move (if continuing RIGHT) would lead to (1, 4), which is a body segment ('S'), causing a collision. Other directions (UP or DOWN) from RIGHT would also hit walls or body segments, making this unsafe long-term.\n\nThus, moving LEFT is the optimal choice to eat an apple and avoid immediate collisions.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#HS SSA#\n# SSSS #\n#    SS#\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, and the current epoch is 22. The snake can't reverse direction, so from LEFT, it can't go RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT (but maybe not if that's a bad move).\n\nFirst, let's map out the snake's position. The head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. Let's list the coordinates. The board is 8x8, with row 0 being the top. Let's index rows from 0 to 7, columns 0 to 7.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #HS SSA# → positions 1 to 6 (since 0 and 7 are #). So positions:\n- (1,1): H (head)\n- (1,2): S\n- (1,3): (space)\n- (1,4): S\n- (1,5): S\n- (1,6): A (apple)\nRow 2: # SSSS # → positions 1-6:\n- (2,1): space\n- (2,2): S\n- (2,3): S\n- (2,4): S\n- (2,5): S\n- (2,6): space\nRow 3: #    SS# → positions 1-6:\n- (3,1): space\n- (3,2): space\n- (3,3): space\n- (3,4): S\n- (3,5): S\n- (3,6): space (since 7 is #)\nRow 4: #  A   # → (4,3) is A\nRow 5: #   A  # → (5,4) is A\nRow 6: #      # → all spaces except walls\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the snake's head is at (1,1). The body parts: let's track the order. Since the snake is moving LEFT (current direction), the next head position would be (1,0) if it continues LEFT, but (1,0) is a wall (since row 1, column 0 is #). So moving LEFT would hit the wall, which is a collision. That's bad. So the snake can't go LEFT.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT? Wait, the current direction is LEFT. The rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. Reversing direction would be if the current direction is LEFT, then RIGHT is the reverse. So the snake can't turn to RIGHT (since that's reversing). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT (but LEFT is into a wall). So the available directions are UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check where the head is. Current head position (1,1). Let's see possible next positions:\n\nIf direction is UP: head moves to (0,1). But row 0 is a wall (all #), so (0,1) is a wall. So moving UP would hit the wall. That's a collision, game over. So UP is invalid.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: head moves to (2,1). Let's check (2,1) in the current board. Row 2, column 1: the current row 2 is \"# SSSS #\", so column 1 is a space (since index 1 in row 2 is a space). So (2,1) is a space. Is that part of the snake's body? Let's check the body positions. The current body is:\n\nFrom row 1: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) (since row 1 has HS SSA → positions 1: H, 2: S, 3: space, 4:S,5:S,6:A). Then row 2 has SSSS at positions 2,3,4,5 (so (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)). Row 3 has SS at (3,4), (3,5). So (2,1) is a space, not part of the snake's body. So moving DOWN would take the head to (2,1), which is safe.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: Wait, the current direction is LEFT. Reversing direction (from LEFT to RIGHT) is not allowed. So can't choose RIGHT. So the only possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT. But LEFT and UP lead to walls, so the only safe direction is DOWN.\n\nWait, let's confirm:\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since you can't reverse to RIGHT). Let's check each:\n\n- LEFT: next head position (1,1) → moving left would be (1,0). Row 1, column 0 is a wall (since row 1 starts with #). So (1,0) is a wall. Collision. Game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n- UP: next head position (0,1). Row 0 is all #, so (0,1) is a wall. Collision. Game over. So UP is invalid.\n\n- DOWN: next head position (2,1). Check (2,1) in the current board. Row 2 is \"# SSSS #\", which is columns 0: #, 1: (space), 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 5:S, 6: (space), 7: #. So (2,1) is a space. So that's empty. So moving DOWN here is safe.\n\nAre there any apples in the next position? The current apples are at (1,6), (4,3), (5,4). The next head position if moving DOWN is (2,1), which is a space, not an apple. So the snake doesn't eat an apple, but just moves. The body will follow. Since the snake's length is the number of S and H. Let's count the current snake length: H (1) + S's. Let's count S's:\n\nRow 1: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) → 3 S's.\n\nRow 2: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) → 4 S's.\n\nRow 3: (3,4), (3,5) → 2 S's.\n\nTotal S's: 3 +4 +2=9. So total length is 1 (H) +9 (S) =10. So when moving, the tail (the last S) will move forward. So moving DOWN would be safe.\n\nTherefore, the only possible direction that doesn't cause collision is DOWN.\n\n\n########\n#HS SSA#\n# SSSS #\n#    SS#\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 1, column 1) (rows 0-7, columns 0-7).  \n2. **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (cannot turn to RIGHT).  \n3. **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or LEFT (RIGHT is invalid due to reversal rule).  \n\n### Evaluating Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (1, 0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall in all rows). Collision → Game Over.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0, 1), which is a wall (row 0 is all walls). Collision → Game Over.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (2, 1). Checking (2, 1) on the board: row 2, column 1 is empty (not a wall or snake body). This is a safe move.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only safe direction to avoid collision is DOWN.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS SSA#\n#HSSSS #\n#    S #\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, and the epoch is 23. The snake is moving down. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. The snake can't reverse direction, so since it's moving DOWN, the next direction can't be UP. The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n\nFirst, let's locate the head. Looking at the board, the second row (since the first is ########) is row 1 (if we start counting from 0). Let's list the rows:\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: #SS SSA#\nRow 2: #HSSSS #\nRow 3: #    S #\nRow 4: #  A   #\nRow 5: #   A  #\nRow 6: #      #\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo the head 'H' is in row 2. Let's check the position of 'H' in row 2. The row is \"#HSSSS #\", so columns (0-based) 0 is '#', column 1 is 'H', then columns 2-5 are 'S', column 6 is ' ', column 7 is '#'. So H is at (row=2, column=1).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So the next position the head would move to is row 3, column 1. Let's check that position. Row 3 is \"#    S #\". Column 1 of row 3 is ' ' (since row 3: index 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is ' ', 4 is ' ', 5 is 'S', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'). So (3,1) is empty. So if we continue moving DOWN, the head moves to (3,1). But we need to check if that's a safe move. Also, are there any apples in the possible directions?\n\nLet's list the positions of apples. Apples are 'A's. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 1: #SS SSA# → the 'A' is at column 6 (since after SS SSA, the last character before # is A). So row 1, column 6.\n\nRow 4: #  A   # → A is at column 3 (row 4, column 3).\n\nRow 5: #   A  # → A is at column 4 (row 5, column 4).\n\nSo apples are at (1,6), (4,3), (5,4).\n\nNow, the snake's body is made of 'S's. Let's map the snake's body positions. The head is at (2,1). The body is the 'S's connected to it. Let's track the snake's body.\n\nRow 2: \"#HSSSS #\" → H is at (2,1), then S at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). So that's 4 S's in row 2, columns 2-5.\n\nRow 1: \"#SS SSA#\" → S's here. Let's parse row 1: column 1 is 'S', column 2 is 'S', column 3 is ' ', column 4 is 'S', column 5 is 'S', column 6 is 'A'. So S's at (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5).\n\nRow 3: \"#    S #\" → S at (3,5).\n\nSo the snake's body positions (excluding head) are:\n\n(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,5).\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN. The next possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since can't go UP). Let's evaluate each possible direction:\n\n1. Continue moving DOWN: next head position is (3,1). Check if (3,1) is a wall or body. (3,1) is ' ', which is safe. No collision. Also, (3,1) is not an apple. So the snake moves here, the tail (the last body part) would move. But since the snake hasn't eaten an apple, the length remains the same. So the body would shift: the head moves to (3,1), and the last body part (probably (1,1) or (1,2), but need to track the order). But for collision, we just need to check the new head position.\n\n2. Move LEFT: direction LEFT. The snake's current direction is DOWN. Turning LEFT is allowed (since LEFT is not opposite of DOWN). The next head position would be (2,0). But (2,0) is a wall (since row 2 starts with '#', column 0 is '#'). So moving LEFT would hit the wall, game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n3. Move RIGHT: direction RIGHT. The next head position is (2,2). (2,2) is 'S' (body part). So moving RIGHT would cause the snake to collide with its own body. That's a game over. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo the only possible direction that doesn't cause immediate collision is DOWN. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head at (2,1). Moving DOWN (row increases by 1, column same) → (3,1). Check row 3, column 1: the row 3 is \"#    S #\", so column 1 is ' ', which is empty. So no collision. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nWhat about the apples? The apples are at (1,6), (4,3), (5,4). If the snake moves DOWN, next head is (3,1). Then, in the next steps, maybe the snake can reach those apples. But since we have to choose the next direction, the only safe option is DOWN. Because LEFT leads to wall, RIGHT leads to body, and UP is reverse (can't do that). So the correct direction is DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS SSA#\n#HSSSS #\n#    S #\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and collision risks:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at (row=2, column=1). The current direction is DOWN, so the snake is moving downward.\n2. **Forbidden Direction**: The snake cannot reverse direction, so UP is invalid.\n3. **Possible Directions**: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row=2, column=0), which is a wall ('#'). Collision with walls ends the game. **Invalid**.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row=2, column=2), which is a body segment ('S'). Collision with the body ends the game. **Invalid**.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (row=3, column=1), which is an empty space (' '). No collision with walls or the body. **Safe**.\n\nThe only safe direction that avoids immediate collision is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body segments are 'S', and apples are 'A'. The current direction is DOWN, and the epoch is 24 (so we have 76 more epochs left, but the game could end earlier if there's a collision).\n\nLet me sketch out the board row by row to visualize better:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SS SSA# → So positions (1,1) is S, (1,2) is S, (1,3) is space, (1,4) is S, (1,5) is S, (1,6) is A, (1,7) is #\nRow 2: #SSSSS # → (2,1) S, (2,2) S, (2,3) S, (2,4) S, (2,5) S, (2,6) space, (2,7) #\nRow 3: #H     # → (3,1) H, (3,2) space, (3,3) space, (3,4) space, (3,5) space, (3,6) space, (3,7) #\nRow 4: #  A   # → (4,1) space, (4,2) space, (4,3) A, (4,4) space, (4,5) space, (4,6) space, (4,7) #\nRow 5: #   A  # → (5,1) space, (5,2) space, (5,3) space, (5,4) A, (5,5) space, (5,6) space, (5,7) #\nRow 6: #      # → (6,1) space, (6,2) space, (6,3) space, (6,4) space, (6,5) space, (6,6) space, (6,7) #\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,1) (since rows are 0-indexed, row 3 is the fourth row). The current direction is DOWN, which means the snake is moving down. Let's confirm the direction: moving down from row 3 would take the head to row 4, same column (since direction is DOWN, so row increases by 1, column stays the same).\n\nFirst, we need to check the possible directions the snake can turn. The snake cannot reverse direction. Since current direction is DOWN, the snake can't turn UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since the player can choose to keep the direction, but the options are to input one of the four, but can't reverse). Wait, the problem says the player controls by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., current direction UP, can't turn to DOWN). So current direction is DOWN. So the forbidden direction is UP. So possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since the player can input any of the four except the reverse).\n\nSo the options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (since UP is reverse of DOWN and is invalid).\n\nNow, let's check where the head would move if we choose each direction.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,1) (row 3, column 1). Let's use (row, column) coordinates, with row 0 at the top.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. Let's compute next positions for each possible direction.\n\nOption 1: Continue DOWN (direction DOWN). Then the new head position would be (4,1). Let's check what's at (4,1). Looking at row 4: #  A   # → columns 0 is #, column 1 is space (since \"#  A   #\" → columns 1 and 2 are spaces, column 3 is A). So (4,1) is space. Then, the snake moves here. Since it's not an apple, the snake's body will follow. The previous head (3,1) becomes S, and the new head is (4,1). But we need to check if this new position is a wall or a body part. (4,1) is within the board (row 4 is between 0 and 7, column 1 is between 0 and 7, not a wall). The current body parts are in row 1 (columns 1,2,4,5), row 2 (columns 1-5). (4,1) is space, not a body part. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nOption 2: Turn LEFT. Direction LEFT. Since current direction is DOWN, turning LEFT is allowed (not reverse). The movement for LEFT direction is column decreases by 1, row stays same. So new head position would be (3,0). But (3,0) is a wall (since row 3 starts with '#'). So moving LEFT would hit the wall. That's a collision, game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nOption 3: Turn RIGHT. Direction RIGHT. Movement is column increases by 1. So new head position is (3,2). Check (3,2): in row 3, it's space. No collision with walls (since column 2 is within 0-7). Check if (3,2) is a body part. Looking at the current board, the body is in row 1 (columns 1,2,4,5), row 2 (columns 1-5). (3,2) is space, so safe. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nOption 4: Turn UP. Direction UP. That's reverse of current direction (DOWN), which is not allowed. So UP is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are DOWN, RIGHT. Let's check if any of these directions lead to eating an apple.\n\nCurrent apples are at:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1, column 6: A (position (1,6))\n\nRow 4, column 3: A (position (4,3))\n\nRow 5, column 4: A (position (5,4))\n\nIf we move DOWN (new head (4,1)), that's a space. No apple there.\n\nIf we move RIGHT (new head (3,2)), that's a space. No apple.\n\nWhat's the next step? The snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's think about the path to the apples.\n\nCurrent head is at (3,1). Let's see the positions of the apples:\n\nApple 1: (1,6) → top right area.\n\nApple 2: (4,3) → row 4, column 3 (down and right from current head).\n\nApple 3: (5,4) → row 5, column 4 (further down and right).\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. Let's see the possible paths.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN (to (4,1)), next possible directions. From (4,1), possible directions (since current direction would be DOWN now, so can't go UP). So possible directions: LEFT (column 0, wall), RIGHT (column 2), or DOWN (row 5, column 1). Let's see (4,1) is in row 4. The next position if moving DOWN again would be (5,1). (5,1) is space (row 5 is \"#   A  #\", column 1 is space). Then from (5,1), direction DOWN would go to (6,1), which is space. Then (7,1) is a wall (row 7 is all #). So that path would eventually hit the wall if not turned.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake turns RIGHT from (3,1) (current head) to (3,2), then direction is RIGHT. Then next move would be to (3,3) (since direction RIGHT), then (3,4), etc. Let's see:\n\nFrom (3,1) → RIGHT → (3,2) (safe). Then next direction can't be LEFT (reverse of RIGHT). So possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Let's see, moving RIGHT again to (3,3). (3,3) is space. Then (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) (row 3's row is \"#H     #\", so columns 1 is H, 2-6 are spaces). So moving right along row 3 could reach column 6 (3,6) which is space. Then, if direction is RIGHT again, (3,7) is a wall. So need to turn.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,2), direction DOWN would take to (4,2). (4,2) is space (row 4 is \"#  A   #\", column 2 is space). Then (4,3) is the apple at (4,3). Oh, right! (4,3) is an apple. So if the snake moves RIGHT to (3,2), then direction can be DOWN (since current direction would be RIGHT, so can't go LEFT). Then moving DOWN from (3,2) would take to (4,2), then next move direction DOWN again (if possible) to (5,2), but perhaps better to go towards the apple.\n\nWait, let's think step by step. Let's consider the next move. The current move is the direction we choose now. Let's first decide the immediate next move.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT, the head moves to (3,2). That's safe, no collision. Then, in the next epoch (epoch 25), the direction could be adjusted again. The apple at (4,3) is in row 4, column 3. From (3,2), moving DOWN would take the head to (4,2). Then from (4,2), moving RIGHT would take to (4,3), which is the apple. That would be a good path: RIGHT (now) → DOWN (next) → RIGHT (next) to eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose DOWN now, head moves to (4,1). Then, from (4,1), possible directions: RIGHT (to (4,2)), then RIGHT again to (4,3) (the apple). That's also a possible path. Let's see:\n\nCurrent move: DOWN → (4,1). Then next direction can be RIGHT (since current direction is DOWN, so can't go UP). So moving RIGHT from (4,1) would go to (4,2), then RIGHT again to (4,3) (apple). That's two moves to reach the apple. That's possible.\n\nWhich path is better? Let's check the body positions to avoid collision. The snake's body is in row 1 (columns 1,2,4,5), row 2 (columns 1-5). So the body is in the upper part. The head is in row 3, column 1. The body is above the head. So moving down or right would take the head away from the body, which is good (less chance of collision).\n\nIf we move RIGHT now (to (3,2)), the new head is (3,2). The body is in row 2, columns 1-5. So (3,2) is below row 2, column 2 (which is S). So (3,2) is safe. The next move could be DOWN to (4,2), then RIGHT to (4,3) (apple). That's safe.\n\nIf we move DOWN now (to (4,1)), the new head is (4,1). The body is in row 2, columns 1-5, row 1, etc. (4,1) is below row 3, so no body there. Then moving RIGHT to (4,2), then RIGHT to (4,3) (apple). That's also safe.\n\nSo both directions (DOWN and RIGHT) are safe, but which one leads to the apple faster? Let's count steps.\n\nApple at (4,3):\n\nFrom current head (3,1):\n\nIf move RIGHT → (3,2) (step 1), then DOWN → (4,2) (step 2), then RIGHT → (4,3) (step 3, eat apple). So 3 steps.\n\nIf move DOWN → (4,1) (step 1), then RIGHT → (4,2) (step 2), then RIGHT → (4,3) (step 3, eat apple). Also 3 steps.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,4). Let's see how to reach that. From (4,3) (after eating the first apple), moving DOWN to (5,3), then RIGHT to (5,4) (apple). That's two more steps. So that's possible.\n\nThe third apple is at (1,6). That's in row 1, column 6. The snake's body is in row 1, columns 1,2,4,5. So (1,6) is in row 1, column 6 (which is an A). To reach there, the snake would need to go up, but the body is in row 1 and 2, so moving up from lower rows might risk collision.\n\nBut the immediate priority is to reach the closest apples. The apples at (4,3) and (5,4) are below and to the right of the current head, so moving in that direction is better.\n\nNow, let's check if there's any possible collision if we choose either direction.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT now (direction RIGHT):\n\nNew head position is (3,2). The body is in row 2, columns 1-5. (3,2) is row 3, column 2. The body in row 2, column 2 is S. So (3,2) is directly below (2,2) (which is S). But since the snake moves one step at a time, the body segments follow. The current body in row 2, column 2 is part of the snake's body. When the snake moves, the tail (the last segment) may move if the snake doesn't eat an apple. Since the snake's length is currently: let's count the S's.\n\nRow 1 has 'SS SSA' → S's at (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) → 4 S's.\n\nRow 2 has 'SSSSS ' → S's at (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) → 5 S's.\n\nSo total body segments: 4 + 5 = 9. The head is 1, so total length is 10. Each time the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (last segment) is removed. So when moving, the new head is added, and the tail is removed (since length remains same). So the body is a sequence of positions. The snake's body is a path from the head (H) to the tail.\n\nAssuming the snake is moving in a certain direction, the body follows. Let's think about the snake's current path. The head is at (3,1). The body is in row 2, columns 1-5. So the snake's body probably goes up from (3,1) to (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), then to row 1, columns 5, 4, 2, 1. So the snake is coiled in the upper left area, with the head at (3,1) pointing down.\n\nIf the snake moves down to (4,1), then the new head is (4,1), and the tail (the last S) would be removed. Let's say the tail was at (1,1) (since row 1, column 1 is S). So when moving down, the body shifts: (3,1) becomes S, (2,1) becomes S (but maybe part of the body), etc. The key point is that moving down or right would take the head away from the body, so no collision.\n\nSo both directions (DOWN and RIGHT) are safe. But which is better? Let's check the next positions again.\n\nIf we choose DOWN, the next head is (4,1). Then, the next possible direction could be RIGHT to (4,2), then RIGHT to (4,3) (apple). That's a clear path.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT, the next head is (3,2). Then, the next direction could be DOWN to (4,2), then RIGHT to (4,3) (apple). Also clear.\n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN is better because the current direction is DOWN, so the snake is already moving that way, and changing direction to RIGHT might not be necessary. However, the problem allows any direction except reversing.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if there's any possible collision in the next steps. For example, if the snake moves RIGHT now, (3,2) is safe. Then, moving DOWN to (4,2) (row 4, column 2). (4,2) is space. Then moving RIGHT to (4,3) (apple). That's safe.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN now, (4,1) is safe. Then moving RIGHT to (4,2), then RIGHT to (4,3) (apple). Also safe.\n\nSo both options are valid. But the question is which direction to choose. Since the problem requires to output one of the directions, perhaps either is acceptable, but let's check if there's any other factor.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's body is in the upper rows (1 and 2). If the snake moves down, it's moving into more open space (rows 4,5,6 are mostly empty). That's safer to avoid self-collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving right would take the head into row 3, which is empty except for the head. Also safe.\n\nHmm. Since both directions are safe and lead towards apples, perhaps the best choice is to continue moving in the current direction (DOWN) unless there's a reason to turn. But let's confirm the next position if moving DOWN.\n\nCurrent head (3,1). Moving DOWN (direction DOWN) → (4,1). (4,1) is space. No collision. Then, the next move could be to the right towards the apple. That's a good path. So I think moving DOWN is a safe and logical choice here.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS SSA#\n#SSSSS #\n#H     #\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN, and the goal is to choose a safe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) that avoids collisions with walls or the snake's body while moving towards apples. \n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Reverses the current direction (DOWN → UP is invalid).  \n2. **LEFT**: New head position would be (3,0), which is a wall (row 3 starts with '#'). Collision, game over.  \n3. **RIGHT**: New head position is (3,2). This is a space (no wall or body collision). Safe but does not immediately reach an apple.  \n4. **DOWN**: New head position is (4,1). This is a space (no wall or body collision). Safe and keeps the snake moving into open space (rows 4–6 are mostly empty), avoiding the dense body segments in rows 1–2.  \n\n### Strategy:\nThe snake should prioritize safe movement towards apples. The closest apples are at (4,3) and (5,4) (row 4, column 3; row 5, column 4). Moving DOWN (current direction) keeps the snake in open space, allowing subsequent moves (e.g., RIGHT) to reach these apples. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body segments are 'S', apples are 'A', and empty spaces are ' '.\n\nLet me write down the board row by row to visualize it better:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SS SSA# (positions 1-6: S, S, space, S, S, A)\nRow 2: #SSSS  # (positions 1-6: S, S, S, S, space, space)\nRow 3: #S     # (position 1: S, rest spaces)\nRow 4: #H A   # (position 1: H, position 3: A)\nRow 5: #   A  # (position 4: A)\nRow 6: #      # (all spaces except walls)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. The snake's head is in row 4, column 1 (since row 4 is \"#H A   #\", so index 1 is H). Let's confirm the coordinates. Let's assume rows are 0-7 from top to bottom, and columns 0-7 from left to right. So row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom. Column 0 is left, column 7 is right.\n\nSo H is at (4,1) (row 4, column 1). The current direction is DOWN, which means the next move would be to row 5, column 1 (since moving down increases the row number by 1). Let's check where that position is. Row 5 is \"#   A  #\", so column 1 is a space (since row 5: positions 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is space, 3 is space, 4 is A, 5 is space, 6 is space, 7 is #). So the next position if moving DOWN would be (5,1). That's an empty space, so no collision there. But wait, let's check if moving DOWN is allowed. The snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is DOWN. The previous direction (since the snake was moving DOWN, the previous direction before that could have been any except UP, but since the current direction is DOWN, the allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. Because reversing would be moving UP, which is not allowed. So the player can choose to go DOWN (current direction), LEFT, or RIGHT. They can't go UP because that's reversing.\n\nNow, the snake's body: let's track the snake's body segments to avoid collision. The head is at (4,1). The body segments are 'S's. Let's list all the S positions:\n\nRow 1: columns 1,2 (wait row 1 is \"#SS SSA#\", so columns 1: S, 2: S, 3: space, 4: S, 5: S, 6: A. So S positions in row 1 are (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5).\n\nRow 2: \"#SSSS  #\", columns 1-4: S. So (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\n\nRow 3: \"#S     #\", column 1: S. So (3,1).\n\nSo the body segments are:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1).\n\nThe head is (4,1). The snake's length is 1 (head) plus the number of S's. Let's count S's: row 1 has 4 S's (positions 1,2,4,5), row 2 has 4 S's (1-4), row 3 has 1 S (1). So 4+4+1=9 S's. So total length is 10 (head + 9 body).\n\nNow, when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and the body follows. Each move, the tail (last body segment) is removed unless the snake eats an apple. Since the snake is moving, if the new head position is an apple, then the snake grows (so the tail isn't removed), otherwise, the tail is removed (so the body length remains the same).\n\nThe current apples are at (1,6), (4,3), (5,4). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 1: \"#SS SSA#\" → column 6 is A → (1,6).\n\nRow 4: \"#H A   #\" → column 3 is A → (4,3).\n\nRow 5: \"#   A  #\" → column 4 is A → (5,4).\n\nSo three apples.\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at (4,1). If we continue moving DOWN, the next head position is (5,1). Let's check that cell. (5,1) is a space (row 5: \"#   A  #\", so column 1 is ' '). So moving DOWN here would result in the head moving to (5,1). Then, the body segments shift: the previous head (4,1) becomes a body segment, and the tail (the last S) is removed. But since we didn't eat an apple, the tail is removed. Let's check the tail. The tail is the last S in the snake's body. The snake's body is a chain. Let's think about the snake's movement path. Since the current direction is DOWN, the snake was moving down, so the head was previously at (3,1) (since moving down from (3,1) to (4,1)). So (3,1) was the previous head position, which is now a body segment (S). Then the body segments before that would be (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,2), (1,1) — perhaps? Maybe the snake's body is arranged in a way that the segments follow the path. For example, if the snake was moving down, then the body would be in the positions it previously occupied. Let's reconstruct the snake's path.\n\nAssuming the snake's head is at (4,1), moving down. The previous position (epoch 24) would have been (3,1) (since moving down from (3,1) to (4,1) in epoch 25). So (3,1) is now part of the body (S). Before that (epoch 23), the head was at (2,1), moving down to (3,1). So (2,1) is now a body segment. Then epoch 22: head at (2,2), moving down to (2,1). Wait, that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the snake's body is in a different configuration. Let's look at the S positions again.\n\nRow 2 has \"SSSS  #\", so columns 1-4 are S. That's (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Row 1 has \"SS SSA#\", which is (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5). So perhaps the snake's body is arranged in a way that goes from (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (1,4) → (1,5) → ...? Not sure. Maybe the exact path isn't critical right now, but the key is to avoid moving into any S (body) or walls.\n\nThe walls are at the edges (rows 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7). So moving into row 7 (bottom wall) would be a collision. The head is in row 4, moving down. The next row would be 5 (safe), then 6 (safe), then 7 (wall, collision).\n\nNow, the possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. But the snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is DOWN, so reversing would be UP. So UP is not allowed. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible direction:\n\n1. DOWN: Next head position (5,1). Check if that's a wall or body. (5,1) is in row 5, column 1. Row 5 is \"#   A  #\", so column 1 is ' ' (empty). So no collision. The cell is empty, so the snake moves there. The body shifts, and the tail is removed. No apple eaten, so score remains same. This is a safe move.\n\n2. LEFT: Moving left from (4,1) would take the head to (4,0). But column 0 is a wall (since all rows start and end with #). So (4,0) is a wall. Collision! So moving LEFT would end the game. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n3. RIGHT: Moving right from (4,1) to (4,2). Let's check (4,2). Row 4 is \"#H A   #\", which is columns 0: #, 1: H, 2: space, 3: A, 4: space, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So (4,2) is a space (safe). So moving RIGHT is allowed. The new head would be (4,2). No collision with walls or body.\n\n4. UP: Reversing direction (current direction is DOWN, so UP is reverse). Not allowed. So UP is invalid.\n\nSo possible valid directions are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is better? Let's see the apples. The apples are at (1,6), (4,3), (5,4). The head is at (4,1). Let's see the positions:\n\nIf we move DOWN to (5,1), next possible moves. From (5,1), possible directions (since direction would be DOWN now, unless changed). The next position would be (6,1). Then (7,1) which is a wall. So moving down would eventually hit the wall if not changed.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (4,2), then the next possible directions (current direction would be RIGHT, since we changed direction from DOWN to RIGHT). Then, from (4,2), moving RIGHT again would go to (4,3), which is an apple! That's (4,3) which is an A. So if we move RIGHT now, then next move (epoch 26) could be RIGHT again, leading to (4,3), which is an apple. Eating that apple would increase the score by 1 and the snake would grow.\n\nLet's check that. Current head is (4,1). If we choose RIGHT, head moves to (4,2). That's a safe move (no collision). Then, in the next epoch (epoch 26), the direction could be RIGHT again (since current direction would be RIGHT, so possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (can't reverse to LEFT)). So moving RIGHT again from (4,2) would take us to (4,3), which is the apple. Then, the snake would eat the apple, grow, and the score increases. That's a good move.\n\nAlternatively, if we move DOWN to (5,1), then next direction could be RIGHT (since current direction is DOWN, next direction can be RIGHT). Then from (5,1), moving RIGHT would go to (5,2), then (5,3), then (5,4) which is the apple at (5,4). That's another apple. But (5,4) is in row 5, column 4, which is an A. So moving DOWN then RIGHT might also reach an apple, but perhaps moving RIGHT first gets to the apple in (4,3) faster.\n\nSo moving RIGHT now would allow the snake to reach (4,3) (apple) in the next move. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head (4,1). Move RIGHT → (4,2). Next direction (epoch 26) is RIGHT (since we moved RIGHT, so direction is now RIGHT). Then, moving RIGHT again → (4,3) which is A. That's an apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nIf we move DOWN now, head (5,1). Then next direction could be RIGHT, moving to (5,2), then (5,3), then (5,4) (apple). That's three steps. So moving RIGHT now is better because it can reach an apple in one more step (epoch 26).\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any body segments in the path of moving RIGHT? The new head position (4,2) is (row 4, column 2). Let's check if that's an S. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 4 is \"#H A   #\", so column 2 is space. So (4,2) is safe. No S there. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nWhat about after moving RIGHT, the body. The previous head (4,1) becomes a body segment (S). The tail (the last S) would be removed if no apple is eaten. So the body would adjust, but since (4,2) is safe, no collision.\n\nSo the best direction is RIGHT, because it allows the snake to move towards an apple (4,3) in the next step, which would be eaten, increasing the score. Moving DOWN is safe but doesn't immediately lead towards an apple as quickly. LEFT is invalid (wall), UP is invalid (reverse direction). So the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS SSA#\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#H A   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid). Possible valid directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (4,1) (head position) leads to (4,0), which is a wall (collision). Invalid.  \n- **UP**: Reverses the current direction (DOWN), which is not allowed. Invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down to (5,1) (row 5, column 1) is a safe empty space. No collision, but no apple nearby.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right to (4,2) (row 4, column 2) is a safe empty space. From (4,2), the next move (if direction remains RIGHT) would reach (4,3), which contains an apple ('A'). This allows the snake to eat an apple in the next epoch, increasing the score.  \n\nThe optimal choice is RIGHT, as it positions the snake to reach an apple in the next move. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #SS S A# → So positions (1,1)=S, (1,2)=S, (1,3)= (space), (1,4)=S, (1,5)=A\nRow 2: #SSSS  # → (2,1)=S, (2,2)=S, (2,3)=S, (2,4)=S, (2,5)= (space), (2,6)= (space)\nRow 3: #S     # → (3,1)=S, others are space\nRow 4: #SHA   # → (4,1)=S, (4,2)=H (head), (4,3)=A, (4,4)= (space), (4,5)= (space)\nRow 5: #   A  # → (5,3)=A\nRow 6: #      # → all spaces\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,2) (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top, columns 0-indexed from left). The current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is moving to the right. The snake can't reverse direction, so from RIGHT, it can't go LEFT. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since reversing to LEFT is not allowed).\n\nLet's check the next positions for each possible direction.\n\nCurrent head position is (4,2). Let's note the coordinates: rows 0 (top) to 7 (bottom), columns 0 (left) to 7 (right). So (row, column).\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT, so the next move in RIGHT direction would take the head to (4,3). Let's check what's there. Looking at row 4: \"#SHA   #\", so (4,3) is 'A' (apple). So if the snake moves RIGHT, it will eat the apple. That's good because it increases the score and the snake grows.\n\nBut wait, we need to check if moving in any direction would cause a collision. Let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. RIGHT: next head position (4,3). What's there? It's an 'A'. So eating the apple. The snake's body is currently in positions. Let's list all S and H positions to check for collisions.\n\nSnake's body positions (including H):\n\nFrom row 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,4)\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,2) (H)\nSo all S positions are (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (4,1). The head is (4,2).\n\nIf moving RIGHT to (4,3), that's an apple, so no collision. The new head is (4,3), and since the snake grows, the tail doesn't move. So that's safe.\n\n2. UP: direction is UP. The next head position would be (3,2). Let's check (3,2). The row 3 is \"#S     #\", which is (3,1)=S, (3,2) is a space. So (3,2) is empty. So moving UP would take the head to (3,2). Is that a collision? The snake's body is at (3,1), which is adjacent, but (3,2) is a space. So no collision. But we need to check if that's a valid move.\n\n3. DOWN: direction is DOWN. Next head position is (5,2). Let's check row 5: \"#   A  #\". So (5,2) is a space (since (5,3) is A). So (5,2) is empty. No collision here either.\n\n4. LEFT: can't do that because current direction is RIGHT, and reversing direction is not allowed. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples and avoid collision. Let's see where the apples are. Current apples are:\n\nRow 1, column 5 (1,5): A\nRow 4, column 3 (4,3): A (the one in the head's right)\nRow 5, column 3 (5,3): A\n\nIf we move RIGHT, we immediately eat the apple at (4,3). That's a good move. Let's check if moving RIGHT would cause any problem. The next head is (4,3). Since it's an apple, the snake grows. The new body would include the previous head (4,2) as S, and the rest of the body follows. So after moving RIGHT, the head is (4,3) (now H), the previous H (4,2) becomes S, and the rest of the body shifts. So no collision with the body because (4,3) was an apple, not part of the snake's body.\n\nWhat about other directions? If we move UP to (3,2), that's a space, but no apple. The snake doesn't grow, and we just move. Similarly, moving DOWN to (5,2) is a space, no apple. So the best move is to go RIGHT and eat the apple, increasing the score and growing the snake. That's the optimal choice here.\n\n\n########\n#SS S A#\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#SHA   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 4, column 2) (0-indexed).\n2. **Current Direction**: RIGHT (snake is moving right; cannot reverse to LEFT).\n3. **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT is invalid due to direction reversal rule).\n4. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,5), (4,3), and (5,3).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right takes the head to (4,3), which is an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake. No collision occurs here because (4,3) is not part of the snake's body (current snake body positions are (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (4,1)). This is safe and beneficial.\n- **UP**: Moving up takes the head to (3,2), which is empty (no apple). This does not grow the snake and provides no immediate benefit.\n- **DOWN**: Moving down takes the head to (5,2), which is empty (no apple). This also does not grow the snake.\n\nThe best choice is to move RIGHT to eat the apple at (4,3), maximizing score and growth.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by analyzing the game board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#'. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S', and apples are 'A'. The current direction is RIGHT, and the epoch is 27 (so we're well before the 100th epoch, so the game isn't ending due to that yet).\n\nFirst, let's map out the positions. Let's list each row from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7):\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SS S A# → positions 1-6 (since walls are at 0 and 7). Let's index columns 1-6:\n- Column 1: S\n- Column 2: S\n- Column 3: (space)\n- Column 4: S\n- Column 5: (space)\n- Column 6: A\nRow 2: #SSSS  # → columns 1-6:\n- 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 5: (space), 6: (space)\nRow 3: #S     # → column 1:S, others (2-6) space\nRow 4: #SSH   # → columns 1:S, 2:S, 3:H, 4: (space), 5: (space), 6: (space)\nRow 5: #   A  # → column 4:A (since columns 1-3 are space, 4:A, 5-6 space)\nRow 6: #     A# → column 6:A (columns 1-5 space, 6:A)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at row 4, column 3 (since row 4 is \"#SSH   #\", so column 3 is H). Let's confirm that. Let's index rows from top (0) to bottom (7), and columns left (0) to right (7). So row 4 is the fifth line (since 0-based). The string is \"#SSH   #\", which is 8 characters. So positions:\n\nRow 4: columns 0 is '#', 1 is 'S', 2 is 'S', 3 is 'H', 4 is ' ', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So H is at (4,3).\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving RIGHT, so the next head position would be (4,4) (since moving right increases column by 1). Let's check what's at (4,4). In row 4, column 4 is a space (since the string is \"#SSH   #\", so after H (column 3) comes column 4 as ' ', 5 as ' ', 6 as ' '). So (4,4) is empty. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,4). Now, need to check if that's a collision. The body parts are 'S's. Let's list all S positions.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: columns 1 (S), 2 (S), 4 (S)\nRow 2: columns 1,2,3,4 (all S)\nRow 3: column 1 (S)\nRow 4: columns 1 (S), 2 (S)\nSo S positions are:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,4),\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4),\n(3,1),\n(4,1), (4,2)\n\nThe head is at (4,3). The next position if moving RIGHT is (4,4). Let's check if (4,4) is a wall or S. The walls are at column 0 and 7, rows 0 and 7. (4,4) is within the board (rows 1-6, columns 1-6 are the play area). So (4,4) is not a wall. And (4,4) is not in the S positions listed above. So moving RIGHT is safe for this step. Now, does (4,4) have an apple? Let's check apples. The apples are 'A's.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1, column 6: A → (1,6)\nRow 5, column 4: A → (5,4)\nRow 6, column 6: A → (6,6)\n\n(4,4) is a space, no apple. So moving RIGHT would just move the head to (4,4), and the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is the number of S and H (since H is the head, and initial length 1). Let's count the S and H:\n\nH is 1. S count:\n\nRow 1: 3 S (columns 1,2,4)\nRow 2: 4 S (columns 1-4)\nRow 3: 1 S (column 1)\nRow 4: 2 S (columns 1,2)\nTotal S: 3+4+1+2=10. So total length is 11 (10 S + 1 H). When the snake moves, the tail (the last S) would move only if it doesn't eat an apple. Since moving RIGHT doesn't eat an apple, the tail will move (the snake's length remains the same, so the tail is removed from the end).\n\nNow, possible directions. The current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction. So the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since reversing would be LEFT, which is opposite of RIGHT, so not allowed). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nWe need to choose the direction that allows the snake to eat apples without colliding. Let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Current direction is RIGHT. Next position if moving RIGHT is (4,4). As above, safe. No apple here.\n\n2. Direction UP: moving UP from (4,3) would take the head to (3,3). Let's check (3,3). Row 3 is \"#S     #\". So columns 0: #, 1:S, 2: space, 3: space, 4: space, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So (3,3) is space. Is there any S there? The S positions in row 3 are only (3,1). So (3,3) is safe. Is there an apple there? No, apples are at (1,6), (5,4), (6,6). So (3,3) is safe. But moving UP would change direction from RIGHT to UP, which is allowed (not reversing).\n\n3. Direction DOWN: moving DOWN from (4,3) would take the head to (5,3). Let's check (5,3). Row 5 is \"#   A  #\". So columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4:A, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So (5,3) is space. Safe? Are there any S in (5,3)? Let's check S positions. The S positions are in rows 1-4. Row 5 has no S. So (5,3) is safe. No apple here. But (5,4) is an apple (A). So if the snake moves DOWN, next head is (5,3). Then, perhaps next move towards (5,4) (RIGHT) to eat the apple.\n\n4. Direction LEFT: Not allowed, since current direction is RIGHT. Reversing direction (LEFT is opposite of RIGHT) is not allowed. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nNow, the snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's see where the apples are. The apples are at (1,6), (5,4), (6,6).\n\nThe head is at (4,3). Let's see the positions:\n\n- (5,4) is an apple. That's in row 5, column 4. The head is at (4,3). To reach (5,4), possible path: move DOWN to (5,3), then RIGHT to (5,4). That would eat the apple. Let's check if that path is possible.\n\nIf current direction is RIGHT, and we choose to move DOWN (allowed, since not reversing), then the next head position is (5,3). Then, the next direction could be RIGHT (since current direction would be DOWN, so next directions can't be UP). Moving RIGHT from (5,3) would go to (5,4), which is the apple. That would be a good move. So perhaps moving DOWN now to set up for eating the apple at (5,4) next step.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (4,4). Then, possible next moves. (4,4) is space. Then, if direction is RIGHT again, (4,5) (space), then (4,6) (space). Then, maybe down towards row 5, column 6, which is (6,6) (another apple). But (6,6) is an apple. So (4,6) is row 4, column 6. Then moving down to (5,6), (6,6) would reach the apple. But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,6). That's in row 1, column 6. The head is at (4,3). To reach (1,6), the snake would need to move up, then right. But row 1 has S's. Let's check row 1: \"#SS S A#\". So row 1, columns 1:S, 2:S, 3: space, 4:S, 5: space, 6:A. So (1,6) is the apple. To get there from (4,3), the snake would have to move up to row 3, 2, 1. But row 2 has S's in columns 1-4. For example, row 2 is \"#SSSS  #\", so columns 1-4 are S. So (2,3) is S. So if the snake is moving up from (3,3) (row 3, column 3) to row 2, column 3, that's (2,3) which is S. So collision. So path to (1,6) might be blocked by S's in row 2.\n\nSo the apple at (5,4) seems more accessible. Let's check the path again. Current head (4,3). If we move DOWN to (5,3), then next direction can be RIGHT (since current direction would be DOWN, so next direction can't be UP). So moving RIGHT from (5,3) would take head to (5,4), which is the apple. That's a good move. So moving DOWN now would allow the snake to reach the apple in the next step.\n\nLet's confirm that (5,3) is safe. (5,3) is in row 5, column 3. The S positions are all in rows 1-4. So (5,3) is not an S. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nWhat if we move UP? Let's check. Moving UP from (4,3) to (3,3). Then, possible next directions. The current direction would be UP. So next directions can't be DOWN. Let's say next direction is RIGHT. Then, (3,4). Is (3,4) safe? Row 3 is \"#S     #\", so column 4 is space. Then, (3,4) is safe. Then, moving RIGHT again to (3,5), (3,6), etc. But that's not leading towards an apple quickly. The apples are at (5,4), (6,6), (1,6). So moving UP may not be as beneficial.\n\nMoving RIGHT now (current direction) would take head to (4,4). Then, next direction could be DOWN (since current direction is RIGHT, next directions can't be LEFT). So moving DOWN from (4,4) to (5,4) which is the apple. Oh, that's even better! Because (4,4) is the next position if moving RIGHT. Then, (4,4) is in row 4, column 4. Then, moving DOWN (from direction RIGHT, next direction can be DOWN) to (5,4), which is the apple. So that's a direct path.\n\nWait, let's recheck. If current direction is RIGHT, moving RIGHT takes head to (4,4). Then, next direction can be DOWN (since you can change direction to DOWN from RIGHT, as it's not reversing). Then, moving DOWN from (4,4) would go to (5,4), which is the apple. That's even better. Because (5,4) is an apple. So moving RIGHT now, then DOWN next step would eat the apple.\n\nSo (4,4) is (row 4, column 4). Then (5,4) is row 5, column 4. Which is the apple. So that's a possible path. Let's confirm (4,4) is safe. Yes, (4,4) is space. So moving RIGHT is safe, and then next step moving DOWN to (5,4) (apple) would be a good move.\n\nSo the current step, choosing to move RIGHT is safe and sets up for eating the apple next step. Let's check if (4,4) is safe. Yes. So moving RIGHT is the best option here.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS S A#\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#SSH   #\n#   A  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 4, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT (snake is moving right).\n- **Possible Directions**: Since the snake cannot reverse direction, valid directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (LEFT is invalid as it reverses RIGHT).\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,6), (5,4), and (6,6).\n- **Collision Check**: The snake loses if it hits walls (boundaries) or its own body ('S').\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **RIGHT (Current Direction)**:  \n   Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,4). This position is empty (no walls or 'S'), so it is safe. After moving, the snake can then pivot DOWN to (5,4) (an apple) in the next step, allowing it to eat the apple and grow.  \n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Moving UP would take the head to (3,3). This position is safe but does not lead directly toward an apple. It would require additional steps to reach an apple, making it less optimal.  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Moving DOWN would take the head to (5,3). This position is safe but does not immediately lead to an apple. The next move would need to be RIGHT to reach (5,4) (the apple), which is less direct than moving RIGHT first.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is the best choice. It keeps the snake safe, maintains progress, and sets up a direct path to the apple at (5,4) in the next step.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided. \n\nThe board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #SS   A# → So positions (1,1) and (1,2) are 'S' (body), then spaces, then an 'A' at (1,5)\nRow 2: #SSSS  # → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) are 'S'\nRow 3: #S     # → (3,1) is 'S'\nRow 4: #SSSH  # → (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) are 'S', (4,4) is 'H' (head)\nRow 5: #   A  # → (5,3) is 'A'\nRow 6: #     A# → (6,5) is 'A'\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the snake is moving right. The snake's head is at (4,4). Let's confirm the snake's body positions to check for possible collisions. \n\nThe snake's body is made of 'S's. Let's list all 'S' and 'H' positions:\n\nH is at (4,4). Then, the body segments (since the snake moves, the body follows the head's path). Let's track the body. The snake's body is in a sequence. Since the current direction is RIGHT, the head was moving right. Let's see the positions:\n\nRow 4: #SSSH  # → So (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) are 'S', then (4,4) is 'H'. So the next position the head would move to if direction remains RIGHT is (4,5). \n\nNow, the snake's body is a connected chain. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2)\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nSo the entire snake's body (excluding head) is at these positions. The head is at (4,4).\n\nNow, the snake is moving RIGHT. Let's check possible directions. The player can choose to change direction, but cannot reverse. The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake can't reverse to LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Continue RIGHT: The head moves to (4,5). Let's check what's there. The current row 4 is \"#SSSH  #\", so (4,5) is a space (since the row is \"#SSSH  #\", which is 8 characters. Let's count: index 0 is '#', 1 is 'S', 2 'S', 3 'S', 4 'H', 5 ' ', 6 ' ', 7 '#'. So (4,5) is a space. So moving right here would be safe. But is there any apple there? No, because row 4's (4,5) is space. The apples are at (1,5), (5,3), (6,5). So moving right would not eat an apple. The new head position is (4,5), and the body would shift. The tail (the last 'S') would move forward. Wait, but the snake's length: since the snake hasn't eaten an apple recently, its length is fixed. So when it moves, the head moves to new position, and the tail (the oldest part) is removed. Wait, no: the snake's length increases when it eats an apple. Otherwise, when moving, the head moves forward, and the tail is removed (so length remains same). So if the snake doesn't eat an apple, the body follows, with the tail being the last segment.\n\nBut first, need to check for collision when moving in each direction.\n\n2. Direction UP: The head is at (4,4). Moving UP would take it to (3,4). Let's check (3,4). Row 3 is \"#S     #\", so positions (3,0) is '#', (3,1) is 'S', (3,2-6) are spaces, (3,7) is '#'. So (3,4) is a space. So (3,4) is empty. So moving up would be to (3,4). Is that a collision? The body positions are the S's listed earlier. Let's check if (3,4) is any of the S positions. The S positions are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (3,4) is not among them, so safe.\n\n3. Direction DOWN: The head is at (4,4). Moving DOWN would take it to (5,4). Check row 5: \"#   A  #\". Let's parse row 5: (5,0) '#', (5,1) ' ', (5,2) ' ', (5,3) 'A', (5,4) ' ', (5,5) ' ', (5,6) ' ', (5,7) '#'. So (5,4) is a space. So (5,4) is empty. Check if (5,4) is in the body positions. The S positions don't include (5,4), so safe.\n\n4. Direction LEFT: Can't do that because current direction is RIGHT, and reversing direction is not allowed. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's check where the apples are. Apples at (1,5), (5,3), (6,5). Let's see the positions:\n\nCurrent head is (4,4). Let's think about the path to apples.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (4,5). Next move, if it continues RIGHT, it would go to (4,6), which is a space (row 4 is \"#SSSH  #\", (4,6) is ' '). Then (4,7) is a wall. So can't go further right. So (4,5) is safe.\n\nIf moving UP to (3,4). Then, next possible directions. Let's see. From (3,4), possible directions (since previous direction was UP, can't go DOWN). So next could be UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's see if there's a path to apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4). Then, from (5,4), possible directions (since previous direction is DOWN, can't go UP). So next directions could be DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. The apple at (5,3) is to the left of (5,4). So from (5,4), moving LEFT would take the head to (5,3), which is an apple. That would be good. Because if the snake moves DOWN now (current direction RIGHT, so moving DOWN is allowed), then the head moves to (5,4). Then, next move direction LEFT (since current direction would be DOWN, so can't go UP, but can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN). So from (5,4), moving LEFT would reach (5,3) (apple). That would eat the apple, increasing the score and the snake's length.\n\nSo let's map this out:\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. Let's choose DOWN as the next direction. The head moves from (4,4) to (5,4). Check if (5,4) is safe: yes, it's a space and not a body part. Then, after moving, the snake's body shifts. The new head is (5,4), and the tail (the last 'S') is removed. But since the snake didn't eat an apple, the length remains the same. Then, in the next epoch (epoch 29), the direction could be LEFT (since current direction would be DOWN, so reversing to UP is not allowed, but LEFT is allowed). Then, moving LEFT from (5,4) to (5,3), which is the apple. That would eat the apple, grow the snake, and increase the score.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose to move RIGHT now. The head moves to (4,5). Then, in the next step, direction could be DOWN (since current direction is RIGHT, so can't go LEFT, but can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT). From (4,5), moving DOWN to (5,5). Then, (5,5) is a space. Then, perhaps moving DOWN again to (6,5), which is an apple. (6,5) is the position of the apple in row 6: \"#     A#\" → (6,5) is 'A'. So (6,5) is the apple. So from (5,5), moving DOWN to (6,5) would reach the apple.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nOption 1: Move DOWN now (epoch 28). Then head is (5,4). Next epoch (29), direction LEFT to (5,3) (apple). Eat apple. Good.\n\nOption 2: Move RIGHT now (epoch 28). Head (4,5). Epoch 29, direction DOWN to (5,5). Epoch 30, direction DOWN to (6,5) (apple). Also good.\n\nWhich is better? Let's check if there's any immediate danger. Let's check the body positions again.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (5,4), is that position safe? (5,4) is (row 5, column 4). The body parts are all in rows 1-4, columns 1-4. So (5,4) is not a body part, so safe.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (4,5), (4,5) is (row 4, column 5). The body parts are in row 4, columns 1-3 (S's) and H at 4. So (4,5) is safe.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's body. Let's see the current body structure. The snake's body is in a sort of a U-shape. Let's see the path of the snake. The head is at (4,4). The body in row 4 is (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). Then row 3 has (3,1), row 2 has (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), row 1 has (1,2), (1,1). So the snake's body is a chain that goes from (4,4) (H) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (4,1) → (3,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (1,4)? Wait, row 1 is \"#SS   A#\" → (1,1), (1,2) are S. So (2,4) is S, then row 1's (1,2) is S, (1,1) is S. So the body is connected. So the snake's body is a long chain that starts at the head (4,4) and goes left along row 4 to (4,1), then down to (3,1), then down to (2,1), then right along row 2 to (2,4), then up to (1,4)? Wait, row 1's S's are at (1,1) and (1,2). So (2,4) is S, and (1,2) is S. So perhaps (2,4) connects to (1,2) via (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nThe key is that the body is a connected segment. So when moving, the new head position must not collide with any of the body positions (except when the snake grows, but in this case, if not eating an apple, the tail is removed, so the body shifts).\n\nNow, the apples are at (1,5), (5,3), (6,5). Let's think about the closest apple. The head is at (4,4). The distance to (5,3) is 1 down and 1 left (distance 2). To (6,5) is 2 down and 1 right (distance 3). To (1,5) is 3 up and 1 right (distance 4). So (5,3) is the closest.\n\nIf we move DOWN now (to (5,4)), then next move LEFT (to (5,3)), which is the apple. That's two steps. So that's better. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head (4,4). Move DOWN to (5,4) (epoch 28). Then, direction LEFT (since current direction after moving DOWN would be DOWN, so next direction can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN). Moving LEFT from (5,4) to (5,3) (apple) in epoch 29. That's a valid move. So that's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT (epoch 28) to (4,5). Then, direction DOWN (epoch 29) to (5,5). Then, direction DOWN (epoch 30) to (6,5) (apple). That's three steps, but it's also possible.\n\nBut (5,3) is closer, so moving towards that apple is better.\n\nAnother thing to check: Are there any possible collisions if we choose DOWN? Let's confirm (5,4) is not a body part. The body parts are all in rows 1-4. (5,4) is in row 5, which has no S's (row 5 is \"#   A  #\"). So (5,4) is safe.\n\nSo the best direction here would be DOWN, to approach the nearest apple at (5,3).\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS   A#\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#SSSH  #\n#   A  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head ('H') is at (4,4) (row 4, column 4). The body ('S') occupies positions in rows 1-4, columns 1-4 (no S in rows 5-6).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT (cannot reverse to LEFT).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,5), (5,3), and (6,5). The closest apple is at (5,3) (2 units away: 1 down, 1 left from the head).\n- **Possible Moves**: UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (LEFT is invalid as it reverses direction).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,5) (empty space). This avoids collision but does not reach an apple immediately. Further moves would be needed to reach the apple at (6,5), which is 3 units away.\n2. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,4) (empty space). This moves away from the nearest apple (5,3) and does not help in reaching apples quickly.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (5,4) (empty space, no collision). From (5,4), the next move can be LEFT to reach (5,3), which is the nearest apple. This path allows the snake to eat the apple in 2 steps (current move + next move).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is optimal as it positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (5,3) in the next move, maximizing the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by parsing the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SS   A# → positions (1,1) S, (1,2) S, (1,5) A\nRow 2: #SSSS  # → (2,1) S, (2,2) S, (2,3) S, (2,4) S\nRow 3: #S     # → (3,1) S\nRow 4: #SSSS  # → (4,1) S, (4,2) S, (4,3) S, (4,4) S\nRow 5: #  AH  # → (5,2) A, (5,3) H (head)\nRow 6: #     A# → (6,5) A\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at (5,3). The current direction is DOWN. Since the snake is moving DOWN, the next position the head would move to is (6,3) (since down from row 5 is row 6). Let's check what's in (6,3). The row 6 is \"#     A#\", so columns 0 is #, 1-4 are spaces, 5 is A, 6 is #. So (6,3) is a space (empty). \n\nNow, we need to consider possible directions. The current direction is DOWN. The snake can't reverse direction, so it can't go UP (since current is DOWN, reversing would be UP). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. Wait, no: the snake's movement direction can be changed to any direction except reversing. So if current direction is DOWN, the snake can turn LEFT, RIGHT, or continue moving DOWN. Because reversing would be moving UP (since DOWN's opposite is UP). So allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nWait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, the example given is UP to DOWN (opposite) and LEFT to RIGHT (opposite). So the snake can't turn to the opposite direction. So current direction is DOWN. The opposite direction is UP. So the snake can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since those are not the opposite). So the possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nNow, let's check where each direction would take the head next.\n\nCurrent head position is (5,3) (row 5, column 3). Let's confirm: row 5 is \"#  AH  #\", which is columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: A, 3: H, 4: space, 5: space, 6: #. So (row, column) is (5,3). \n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So moving DOWN would take the head to (6,3). Let's check (6,3): row 6 is \"#     A#\", which is columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: space, 5: A, 6: #. So (6,3) is a space (empty). That's safe, no collision with walls (since row 6 is within 0-7, columns 3 is 0-7) and no collision with body.\n\nIf we choose LEFT: direction LEFT would move the head to (5,2). Let's check (5,2). The row 5 is \"#  AH  #\", so column 2 is 'A' (apple). Oh! Because (5,2) is where the 'A' is. So moving LEFT would take the head to (5,2), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple would make the snake grow, and the score increases. Also, after eating, the apple is consumed, and the snake's body will extend. But we need to check if that move is possible. \n\nWait, when the snake moves LEFT from (5,3), the new head position is (5,2). Let's check if that's a valid position. The walls are only around the edges (row 0 and 7, column 0 and 6). So (5,2) is row 5 (valid), column 2 (valid, since 0-6 are columns, 6 is the wall). So (5,2) is inside the board. Now, is there any body part there? Let's check the current board. The body parts are in rows 1-4. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2)\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\nSo (5,2) is not an 'S' (since row 5's (5,2) is 'A'). So moving LEFT to (5,2) is safe. The snake would eat the apple, grow, and that's a good move.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: direction RIGHT would move the head to (5,4). Let's check (5,4). Row 5: \"#  AH  #\", column 4 is a space. So (5,4) is empty. No collision, but no apple.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: moving to (6,3), which is empty. No apple.\n\nSo the best move here is to go LEFT, because that's where the apple is. Let's confirm again. The head is at (5,3). Moving LEFT (column decreases by 1) would be (5,2), which is 'A'. So that's an apple. So choosing LEFT would allow the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score. Also, moving LEFT is allowed (since current direction is DOWN, and LEFT is not the opposite direction (opposite is UP), so allowed).\n\nTherefore, the best direction to choose is LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#SS   A#\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#SSSS  #\n#  AH  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game board, snake position, and movement constraints:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 5, column 3) (coordinates: row 5, column 3).\n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (cannot turn to UP).\n3. **Possible Directions**: Valid directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (non-reversing directions).\n4. **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (1,5), (5,2), and (6,5).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,3) would take the head to (5,2), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or snake body) and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing in length.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5,3) would take the head to (5,4), an empty space (no apple, no collision).\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5,3) would take the head to (6,3), an empty space (no apple, no collision).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move is LEFT, as it allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, maximizing score growth.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's parse each row from top to bottom:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SS   A# (positions 1-2 are 'S', then spaces, then 'A' at position 5)\nRow 2: #SSSS  # (positions 1-4 are 'S')\nRow 3: #S     # (position 1 is 'S')\nRow 4: #SSSS  # (positions 1-4 are 'S')\nRow 5: #  HS  # (positions 2 is 'H' (head), position 3 is 'S' (body))\nRow 6: # A   A# (position 1 is 'A', position 5 is 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at row 5, column 2 (since rows are 0-indexed, and columns are 0-indexed as well). Let's confirm the coordinates. Each row is surrounded by '#', so the actual play area is from row 1 to row 6 (since row 0 and 7 are walls), and columns 1 to 6.\n\nRow 5: #  HS  # → columns 1: ' ', 2: 'H', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: '#'. So H is at (5,2).\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left, which means each step, the head moves to the left (column decreases by 1). The snake cannot reverse direction, so if current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed).\n\nFirst, we need to check where the head will move if we choose each possible direction. Let's list the possible directions and their next positions:\n\nCurrent head position: (5,2). Current direction is LEFT. The snake's movement direction is determined by the input, but the snake can't reverse. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (since RIGHT is reverse of LEFT, which is not allowed).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT: Next head position would be (5, 2-1) = (5,1). Let's check what's at (5,1). Looking at row 5: #  HS  # → column 1 is ' ' (empty). So that's a valid position (not a wall or snake body). So moving left would take the head to (5,1), which is safe.\n\n2. UP: Moving up from (5,2) would take the head to (4,2). Let's check row 4: #SSSS  #. Columns 1-4 are 'S'. So (4,2) is part of the snake's body (since row 4, column 2 is 'S'). So moving up would cause a collision with the body → game over. So UP is invalid.\n\n3. DOWN: Moving down from (5,2) would take the head to (6,2). Let's check row 6: # A   A#. Column 2 is ' ' (since row 6 is # A   A# → columns 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'A'). So (6,2) is empty. So moving down is safe.\n\n4. RIGHT: Not allowed because current direction is LEFT, and reversing direction is prohibited. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT and DOWN. Now, we need to check if moving in those directions leads to eating an apple (which increases score and grows the snake) or if it's safe.\n\nLet's check LEFT direction: next head position (5,1). What's there? Row 5, column 1 is ' ' (empty). So no apple, snake moves there. The body would follow. Since the snake's length is determined by the number of 'S' and 'H' on the board. Let's count the snake's current length.\n\nCurrent snake body: Let's list all 'S' and 'H' positions.\n\nH is at (5,2). S positions:\n\nRow 1: columns 1 and 2 → (1,1), (1,2)\nRow 2: columns 1-4 → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: column 1 → (3,1)\nRow 4: columns 1-4 → (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\nRow 5: column 3 → (5,3)\nSo total S's: 2 (row1) +4 (row2)+1 (row3)+4 (row4)+1 (row5) = 12. So total length is 12 (S) +1 (H) = 13. So when moving, the tail (the last S) would be removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nIf moving LEFT to (5,1) (empty), then the snake moves: the head is now at (5,1), and the tail (the oldest part of the body) is removed. Let's see where the tail is. The snake's body is a sequence. Since the snake starts with length 1 (H), and grows by adding to the head when it eats apples. Wait, no: in snake games, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and the body follows. When it eats an apple, the tail doesn't move (so the length increases by 1). So the current body positions are the previous positions of the head. So the order of the body segments is from head to tail. Let's try to reconstruct the snake's path.\n\nThe current head is at (5,2). Let's see adjacent S's. The head's next position (if moving LEFT) would be (5,1). The body segment behind the head (the next part) is (5,3) (since H is at (5,2), and S is at (5,3) → so perhaps the direction before was RIGHT? Wait, but current direction is LEFT, so maybe the movement history is such that the snake was moving left, so the head was at (5,3) before, then moved left to (5,2), making (5,3) part of the body. Let's think:\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So the snake's movement direction is left. So the previous head position (epoch 29) would be (5,3), because moving left from (5,3) would take it to (5,2) (current head). So (5,3) is now part of the body (S). Then before that, the head was at (5,4), moving left to (5,3), etc. But perhaps this is getting too detailed. The key is, when moving, the new head is at the new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. The tail (last segment) is removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nSo, if the next move is LEFT to (5,1) (empty), then the new head is (5,1), and the body segments shift: (5,2) becomes S, (5,3) remains S, and the tail (the last S in the current body) is removed. So no apple eaten, score remains same.\n\nIf the direction is DOWN, next head position is (6,2). Let's check row 6, column 2. Row 6 is # A   A# → columns 1: A, 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: A. So (6,2) is ' ', so no apple. So moving down would take head to (6,2), which is safe. Then the body follows.\n\nAlternatively, are there any apples in the possible next positions? Let's check:\n\nCurrent apples are at positions where 'A' is. Let's list all 'A's on the board:\n\nRow 1, column 5 → (1,5)\nRow 6, column 1 → (6,1)\nRow 6, column 5 → (6,5)\n\nSo apples at (1,5), (6,1), (6,5).\n\nIf moving LEFT to (5,1): (5,1) is empty (no apple). Moving DOWN to (6,2): (6,2) is empty. So neither direction immediately leads to an apple. So the next priority is to avoid collision and choose a direction that allows the snake to reach apples in future moves.\n\nLet's look at the current position and possible paths. The head is at (5,2). Current direction is LEFT. Let's see the surrounding areas:\n\n- Left (column 1): (5,1) is empty. Beyond that, (5,0) is a wall (since columns 0 is the wall). So moving left from (5,1) would take to (5,0), which is a wall. So moving left once is safe, but moving left again would hit the wall. So after moving left once, the next direction (if possible) would have to be up or down, but need to check.\n\n- Down (row 6, column 2): (6,2) is empty. From there, moving down would be row 7 (wall), so can't. So moving down to (6,2) is safe. From (6,2), possible directions could be left (to (6,1), which is an apple), right (to (6,3)), or up (back to (5,2), but that's part of the body now if we moved down).\n\nWait, if we move down to (6,2), then the new head is (6,2). The previous head (5,2) becomes S. The body segments shift. So the body would now include (5,2), (5,3), etc. So (5,2) is now part of the body. So moving up from (6,2) would go to (5,2), which is now S → collision. So from (6,2), possible directions would be LEFT (to (6,1)), which is an apple. Let's see: (6,1) is A. So if after moving down to (6,2), the next direction could be LEFT (since current direction would be DOWN, so can't reverse to UP, but can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN). So moving LEFT from (6,2) would take to (6,1), which is an apple. That would be a good move because eating that apple would increase the score.\n\nSo the plan could be: move DOWN now (to (6,2)), then next move LEFT to (6,1) (apple), which is a safe path. Let's verify:\n\nCurrent move: direction DOWN. New head at (6,2). Check if (6,2) is safe. Yes, it's empty. Then, in the next epoch, the direction could be LEFT (since current direction would be DOWN, so LEFT is allowed). Then, moving LEFT from (6,2) to (6,1) (which is A). That would eat the apple, grow the snake, and increase the score.\n\nIf we instead move LEFT now (to (5,1)), then next possible directions. Current direction would be LEFT (since we moved left again). Next move could be LEFT (to (5,0) → wall, game over), UP (to (4,1) → check row 4: #SSSS  #. (4,1) is S (since row 4, column 1 is S). So moving UP from (5,1) would go to (4,1), which is S → collision. DOWN from (5,1) would go to (6,1) → which is A. Oh! Wait, (5,1) is row 5, column 1. Moving DOWN from (5,1) would be (6,1), which is an apple. Let's check:\n\nIf current move is LEFT (to (5,1)), then the next direction options would be UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since direction is now LEFT, can't reverse to RIGHT). So from (5,1), moving DOWN would be (6,1) → which is A. So that's an apple. So moving LEFT now, then DOWN next epoch would get the apple.\n\nSo which path is better? Let's map both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: Move DOWN now → (6,2). Next epoch, direction LEFT → (6,1) (A). That's 2 steps to get the apple.\n\nOption 2: Move LEFT now → (5,1). Next epoch, direction DOWN → (6,1) (A). That's 2 steps as well.\n\nBut let's check if moving LEFT now (to (5,1)) is safe. (5,1) is empty, yes. Then, moving DOWN from (5,1) to (6,1) (A). (6,1) is an apple, so that's safe (no collision). So that's a valid path.\n\nBut wait, when moving LEFT to (5,1), the new head is (5,1). What's the body's new positions? The previous head (5,2) becomes S, and the rest of the body shifts. So the body would now include (5,2), (5,3), and all the other S's. So when moving DOWN from (5,1) to (6,1), that's (6,1) which is A. So that's safe.\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any immediate collisions in either direction. For moving LEFT: (5,1) is safe. For moving DOWN: (6,2) is safe.\n\nWhich direction is better? Let's see if there are other apples. The other apples are at (1,5) and (6,5). Let's see if moving in either direction allows access to those.\n\nBut perhaps the most immediate apple is (6,1), which is reachable in two steps either way. So which direction is possible?\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's body. Let's check the current body positions to see if moving in a certain direction would block the snake.\n\nLooking at the current body:\n\nRow 1 has S at (1,1), (1,2)\nRow 2 has S at (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3 has S at (3,1)\nRow 4 has S at (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\nRow 5 has S at (5,3)\n\nSo the body is mostly on the left side of the board (columns 1-4). The right side (columns 5-6) has some space. The head is at (5,2), so moving left is towards column 1, which is part of the body's area, but (5,1) is empty. Moving down is towards row 6, which has apples at (6,1) and (6,5).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving DOWN is better because it's moving towards the row where there are two apples (row 6 has two A's). Let's confirm:\n\nIf we move DOWN to (6,2), then from there, possible directions:\n\n- LEFT: (6,1) (A) → good.\n- RIGHT: (6,3) → empty, then maybe towards (6,5) (A).\n- DOWN: (7,2) → wall (invalid).\n\nSo moving DOWN now gives access to both apples in row 6. Whereas moving LEFT now would lead to (5,1), then moving DOWN to (6,1) (A), which is one apple. Then, from (6,1), possible directions could be RIGHT (towards (6,5) A) or UP (but UP would go to (5,1), which is now part of the body if we moved there).\n\nHmm. But both options seem viable. However, the question is to choose the direction now. Let's make sure that neither direction leads to immediate collision.\n\nMoving UP is invalid (hits body). Moving RIGHT is invalid (reverse direction). So options are LEFT and DOWN.\n\nAnother check: when moving LEFT, the next position (5,1) is adjacent to row 4, column 1 (which is S). So (4,1) is S. If we move LEFT to (5,1), then moving UP next would be (4,1), which is S → collision. So from (5,1), moving UP is bad, but moving DOWN is good (to (6,1) A).\n\nMoving DOWN to (6,2), then moving LEFT to (6,1) (A) is safe. So both paths are safe. Which is better? Since the problem says to eat as many apples as possible, perhaps either direction is acceptable. But perhaps there's a better option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a collision I'm missing. Let's double-check the head's next positions.\n\nCurrent head (5,2). Moving LEFT: (5,1). Let's confirm row 5, column 1: row 5 is #  HS  #. So columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'H', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: '#'. So (5,1) is ' ', correct. No collision.\n\nMoving DOWN: (6,2). Row 6 is # A   A#. Columns 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: '#'. So (6,2) is ' ', correct. No collision.\n\nSo both directions are safe. Since the problem doesn't give more info, perhaps either is acceptable, but perhaps the best is to choose a direction that leads to an apple sooner. Let's see:\n\nIf we move DOWN now, next possible move to (6,1) (apple) in the next step (epoch 31). If we move LEFT now, next possible move to (6,1) (apple) in epoch 31 as well. So both take the same steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snake's body is arranged such that moving DOWN is less likely to collide in the future. For example, the left side (columns 1-4) has a lot of body segments, so moving towards the right (columns 5-6) might be better for future movement, but in this case, moving DOWN is towards row 6 which has apples on the left (6,1) and right (6,5). So moving DOWN might allow access to both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is DOWN. But I need to choose between LEFT and DOWN. Since the problem requires to pick one of the four directions, and the possible options are LEFT and DOWN.\n\nWait, the current direction is LEFT, so the snake can turn to UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. UP is invalid (body collision), so options are LEFT and DOWN.\n\nIf I were the snake player, I might choose DOWN to avoid the left side where there's more body, and head towards the row with more apples. So I think the best direction is DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#SS   A#\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#SSSS  #\n#  HS  #\n# A   A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). We need to check possible directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT) for safety and apple-eating potential.\n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n1. **UP**: The head (row 5, column 2) would move to row 4, column 2. Row 4 is `#SSSS  #`, so column 2 is part of the snake’s body (`S`). Collision occurs. **Invalid**.\n2. **LEFT**: The head moves to row 5, column 1 (empty space). No collision. Safe but no apple here.\n3. **DOWN**: The head moves to row 6, column 2 (empty space). No collision. Safe and allows access to apples in row 6 (e.g., (6,1) and (6,5)).\n\n### Strategy:\nMoving DOWN avoids the left side (which has dense body segments) and positions the snake to reach apples in row 6 (e.g., (6,1) in the next move). This direction is safer for future apple collection.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by analyzing the given board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. Let's list out each row to see where everything is:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #SS   A# → So positions (1,1)=S, (1,2)=S, then (1,5)=A\nRow 2: #SSS   # → (2,1)=S, (2,2)=S, (2,3)=S\nRow 3: #S     # → (3,1)=S\nRow 4: #SSSS  # → (4,1)=S, (4,2)=S, (4,3)=S, (4,4)=S\nRow 5: #  SS  # → (5,2)=S, (5,3)=S\nRow 6: # AH  A# → Let's check the positions here. The row starts with #, then space, then A, then space, H, space, A, #. So (6,1)= (space), (6,2)=A, (6,3)= (space), (6,4)=H (head), (6,5)= (space), (6,6)=A. So the head is at (6,4) (row 6, column 4).\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. Let's confirm the head's current position. Since the current direction is DOWN, the next move would be towards the row below. But let's check the current head position. In row 6, the head is at (6,4). If moving DOWN, the next position would be (7,4). But row 7 is the bottom wall (all #), so moving DOWN would cause a collision with the wall. That's bad because the game ends if the snake hits the wall. So moving DOWN is not an option.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is DOWN, so the opposite direction is UP. So the snake can't turn UP (since that's reversing). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (but DOWN leads to wall). So options are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check where the head would move if we choose LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nCurrent head position is (6,4). Let's note coordinates as (row, column), where rows are 0-7 (top to bottom), columns 0-7 (left to right). So (6,4) is row 6, column 4.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: the next position is (6,3). Let's check what's at (6,3). Looking at row 6: # AH  A#. So row 6's characters are: index 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: 'A', 7: '#'. So (6,3) is a space (empty). So moving LEFT would take the head to (6,3), which is empty. Then, since the snake is moving, the body parts would follow. The snake's body is the 'S's. Let's check if moving LEFT would cause a collision with the body.\n\nThe snake's body positions: Let's list all S positions.\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2)\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\nRow 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\nRow 5: (5,2), (5,3)\nSo all S positions are: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3).\n\nThe new head position if moving LEFT is (6,3). Is (6,3) in the body positions? Let's check. The body positions are all the S's listed above. (6,3) is not in any of those, so no collision. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: next position is (6,5). Let's check (6,5). Row 6: # AH  A#. So (6,5) is a space (since after H (position 4) is a space at 5, then A at 6). So (6,5) is empty. Then check if (6,5) is a body part. The body positions don't include (6,5), so moving RIGHT is also safe.\n\nNow, let's check for apples. The apples are 'A's. Let's find their positions.\n\nRow 1: (1,5) → A\nRow 6: (6,2) → A, (6,6) → A. Are there any others? Let's check all rows.\n\nRow 1: #SS   A# → (1,5) is A.\nRow 6: # AH  A# → (6,2) and (6,6) are A. So total three apples as per the problem statement.\n\nIf moving LEFT to (6,3): that's a space, no apple. So no growth, just movement. The snake's body would shift: the head moves to (6,3), and the tail (the last S) would be removed unless an apple is eaten. Since no apple is eaten, the tail is removed. So the new body positions would be the previous S's except the last one, and the new head is (6,3), and the next body part would be the old head (6,4) as S.\n\nIf moving RIGHT to (6,5): (6,5) is a space, so same as LEFT, no apple eaten.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another apple I missed. Let's check again. The current board:\n\nRow 1: #SS   A# → columns 0-7. Column 0 is #, 1: S, 2:S, 3: space, 4: space, 5:A, 6: space, 7: #. So (1,5) is A.\n\nRow 6: # AH  A# → column 0: #, 1: space, 2:A, 3: space, 4:H, 5: space, 6:A, 7: #. So (6,2) and (6,6) are A's. That's three apples.\n\nSo, moving LEFT or RIGHT: neither direction leads to an apple. So the choice is between LEFT and RIGHT, but need to avoid future collisions.\n\nBut let's check the current direction. The snake was moving DOWN, which is now impossible (next step is wall). So we have to choose between LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's think about the snake's body structure. The head is at (6,4). The body would be the previous positions. Since the snake is moving, the body segments follow the head. Let's reconstruct the snake's body path. The snake's body is made of S's. Let's see the S positions and how they connect. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2)\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\nRow 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\nRow 5: (5,2), (5,3)\nHead at (6,4)\n\nLet's try to find the order of the snake's body. The head is (6,4). The next segment (the part right behind the head) would be where the head was in the previous move. Since the current direction is DOWN, the head was moving down. So previous head position would be (5,4), but (5,4) is not an S. Let's check row 5: #  SS  # → (5,2)=S, (5,3)=S. So (5,4) is space. So perhaps the snake's movement history is such that the body is arranged in a way that requires tracking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the body segments are in a contiguous path. Let's try to find a path from the head (6,4) back through the S's. Let's see:\n\nHead (6,4). Let's look for adjacent S's (up, down, left, right). The head is at (6,4). Up is (5,4): which is space (row 5: #  SS  # → columns 0-7: 0=#, 1=space, 2=S, 3=S, 4=space, 5=space, 6=space, 7=#. So (5,4) is space. Left is (6,3): space. Right is (6,5): space. Down is (7,4): wall. So the head's previous position (since the direction was DOWN) would have been (5,4), but that's not S. So perhaps the head is part of a longer body that's connected in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the S's form the body, and the head is H. So the snake's body is all the S's plus the head. The length is 1 (head) plus number of S's. Let's count S's:\n\nRow 1: 2 S's → (1,1), (1,2)\nRow 2: 3 S's → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\nRow 3: 1 S → (3,1)\nRow 4: 4 S's → (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\nRow 5: 2 S's → (5,2), (5,3)\nTotal S's: 2+3+1+4+2=12. So the snake's length is 13 (12 S's + 1 H). So when moving, the snake's body will shift: the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail (last S) is removed unless an apple is eaten (which would keep the tail, increasing length).\n\nBut regardless of that, the immediate concern is the next move. Let's check possible directions again.\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN. Next move if direction is DOWN: (7,4) which is wall → collision. So invalid. So direction can't be DOWN. Can't reverse to UP (since current direction is DOWN, reversing is not allowed). So possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: new head position (6,3). Check if (6,3) is wall or body. (6,3) is space (row 6, column 3 is space), not a wall. The body S's are all in rows 1-5, columns 1-4. (6,3) is row 6, column 3. Let's check if (6,3) is an S. The S's in row 6: none. So (6,3) is safe. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: new head position (6,5). (6,5) is space (row 6, column 5 is space). Check if (6,5) is body. The S's are in rows 1-5, columns 1-4. (6,5) is row 6, column 5. No S there. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nNow, which direction is better? Let's look for apples. The apples are at (1,5), (6,2), (6,6). The head is at (6,4). If we move LEFT, the head goes to (6,3). Then next moves could go towards (6,2) which is an apple. Let's see: if next direction is LEFT again (since current direction would then be LEFT), moving to (6,2), which is an apple. That would be good. So moving LEFT now could set up to eat the apple at (6,2) next.\n\nIf we move RIGHT now, the head goes to (6,5). Then next move could be RIGHT again, leading to (6,6), which is an apple. That's also a good path.\n\nSo moving LEFT or RIGHT could lead to apples in the next steps. Let's check the positions.\n\nCurrent head: (6,4)\n\nIf move LEFT → (6,3). Then possible next direction (since current direction would be LEFT) can't reverse (so can't go RIGHT). So next possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT. But DOWN from (6,3) is (7,3) which is wall. So possible directions: UP or LEFT. If direction is LEFT again, head moves to (6,2) which is an apple. That would be good. So moving LEFT now allows us to reach (6,2) in the next step, which is an apple.\n\nIf move RIGHT → (6,5). Then current direction is RIGHT. Next directions can't reverse (so can't go LEFT). Possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. DOWN from (6,5) is (7,5) which is wall. So possible directions: UP or RIGHT. If direction is RIGHT again, head moves to (6,6) which is an apple. That's also good.\n\nSo both directions could lead to apples. Now, check if moving LEFT or RIGHT would cause any immediate or future collision.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (6,3): the new head is (6,3). The next body segment would be (6,4) (old head). The rest of the body shifts. Let's see if (6,3) is adjacent to any body parts that could cause collision in the next steps, but probably not.\n\nSimilarly for moving RIGHT to (6,5): new head (6,5), old head (6,4) becomes S.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's current body is in the left part of the board. The head is in row 6, column 4, which is the middle. Moving LEFT would take it towards column 3, 2 (where the apple is). Moving RIGHT towards column 5,6 (apple there).\n\nSo which is better? Let's check the positions of the apples. The apple at (6,2) is to the left of the head, and (6,6) is to the right. Both are one step away if we move in that direction twice.\n\nBut since the snake can't reverse direction, moving LEFT now (current direction is DOWN, so new direction is LEFT, which is allowed), then next move can be LEFT again (since direction is LEFT, can't reverse to RIGHT). So moving LEFT now, then LEFT again would reach (6,2), which is an apple. That would be a good move.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now, then RIGHT again would reach (6,6), also an apple.\n\nBut let's check if there are any obstacles in those paths. For moving LEFT to (6,3), then LEFT to (6,2): (6,2) is an apple. So that's safe. The (6,2) is not part of the body. The body S's are in rows 1-5, columns 1-4, so (6,2) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is in row 6, column 6, which is not part of the body. So moving RIGHT to (6,5), then RIGHT to (6,6) (apple) is also safe.\n\nSo both directions are possible. But perhaps the snake is currently in a position where moving LEFT would have more space. Let's check the area around.\n\nThe head is at (6,4). Moving LEFT to (6,3) → row 6, column 3. What's below (row 7, column 3) is wall. To the left (row 6, column 2) is apple. Up (row 5, column 3) is S (row 5 has (5,3) as S). So if we move LEFT to (6,3), then moving UP would take us to (5,3), which is S (body). That's a collision. So if after moving LEFT, the next direction is UP, that's bad. But if we continue LEFT, then it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5). Up is (5,5): row 5 is #  SS  # → (5,5) is space. So (5,5) is empty. So moving UP from (6,5) would be (5,5), which is safe.\n\nHmm. But the snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's see which apple is closer. The apple at (6,2) is two steps left (current head at 4, so 4→3→2). The apple at (6,6) is two steps right (4→5→6). Both are same distance.\n\nAnother thing: the current epoch is 31, and the game ends at epoch 100. So there's plenty of time. But we need to avoid walls and self-collision.\n\nSince moving DOWN is into the wall (invalid), and UP is reversing (not allowed), the only options are LEFT and RIGHT. Both are safe. So which one to choose? Maybe either is acceptable, but perhaps the example in the problem statement shows that when moving in a direction that leads to an apple, the snake grows. But in this case, moving LEFT or RIGHT now doesn't immediately eat an apple, but the next move could. So perhaps either direction is acceptable, but perhaps the best choice is to move towards the nearest apple. Since both apples are two steps away, maybe either is okay. \n\nBut perhaps there's another factor. Let's check the current body's position. The snake's body is mostly on the left side of the board (columns 1-4). The head is at (6,4). If we move LEFT to (6,3), the next move to (6,2) (apple) would be into column 2, which is where some of the body is (row 2 has (2,3), (2,2), etc.), but (6,2) is row 6, column 2, which is not part of the body. So it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5), then to (6,6) (apple) which is in column 6. That's on the right side, which is more open (since the body is on the left). So maybe moving RIGHT is better because there's more space on the right, reducing the chance of collision in the future.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT is better. But I think either direction is possible, but according to the problem, I need to choose one. Let's see if there's any other clue. Let's recheck the current board.\n\nIn row 1, there's an apple at (1,5). That's column 5, row 1. So if the snake can move up towards that apple, but that's further away. But the immediate apples are at (6,2) and (6,6).\n\nAnother thing: the snake's current direction is DOWN, and the next possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT. Since the snake was moving down, perhaps the body is behind it (above). So the head is at (6,4), moving down. The body would be in the positions above the head. Let's think about the movement history. If the snake was moving down, then the previous head positions would be (5,4), (4,4), etc. Looking at row 4: (4,4) is S. So (4,4) is part of the body, which suggests that the head was at (4,4) before moving down to (5,4), then (6,4). But (5,4) is not an S. Hmm, perhaps the snake's body is arranged in a more complex path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best move here is to choose LEFT. But I'm not sure. Let's make a decision. Since moving LEFT would allow the next move to reach (6,2) (apple), which is in the same row, and that's a valid move. So I think moving LEFT is a good choice.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS   A#\n#SSS   #\n#S     #\n#SSSS  #\n#  SS  #\n# AH  A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6,4) (row 6, column 4). The current direction is DOWN, but moving DOWN would lead to the bottom wall (row 7, column 4 is a wall), causing a collision. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). Thus, the valid directions are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of LEFT:\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (6,3) (row 6, column 3), which is empty (no wall or body collision). \n- The next move could then be LEFT again (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed), leading the head to (6,2), which is an apple ('A'). This would allow the snake to eat the apple, grow, and increase the score.\n\n### Analysis of RIGHT:\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (6,5) (row 6, column 5), which is also empty (no wall or body collision). \n- The next move could then be RIGHT again, leading the head to (6,6), which is another apple ('A'). This would also allow the snake to eat the apple, grow, and increase the score.\n\nBoth directions are safe, but moving LEFT positions the snake to reach the apple at (6,2) in the next step, which is a more immediate opportunity. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls (the '#' characters). Let's list out each row to get a clear picture:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SS   A# → So positions (1,1)=S, (1,2)=S, (1,5)=A\nRow 2: #SSS   # → (2,1)=S, (2,2)=S, (2,3)=S\nRow 3: #S    A# → (3,1)=S, (3,5)=A\nRow 4: #SSSS  # → (4,1)=S, (4,2)=S, (4,3)=S, (4,4)=S\nRow 5: #  SS  # → (5,2)=S, (5,3)=S\nRow 6: # HS  A# → (6,1)=H (head), (6,2)=S, (6,3)=S, (6,5)=A\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,1) (row 6, column 1). The current direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction, so from LEFT, it can't go RIGHT. Possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed). Wait, wait, the direction input is the direction the snake will move next. The current direction is LEFT, so the snake is moving left. The player can change direction, but can't reverse. So if current direction is LEFT, the next direction can be UP or DOWN (since turning RIGHT would be reversing, which is not allowed). Because moving LEFT, the next possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT? Wait, the problem says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Oh right, so reversing is when you go from UP to DOWN, or LEFT to RIGHT, etc. So if current direction is LEFT, the snake can choose to continue moving LEFT, or turn UP or DOWN, but not RIGHT (since that's the reverse direction of LEFT). So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nNow, the head is at (6,1). Let's see where the next move would take it based on each possible direction.\n\nCurrent position of head: (6,1). Let's note that rows are 0-7 (top to bottom), columns 0-7 (left to right). So (row, column). So (6,1) is row 6, column 1.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So moving LEFT would take the head to (6,0). But (6,0) is a wall (since row 6's first character is '#', which is the wall). So if the snake moves LEFT, it would hit the wall, and the game ends. So that's bad.\n\nSo direction LEFT is invalid (wall collision). So the possible directions now are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT? Wait no, the current direction is LEFT, so the snake can't reverse to RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (but LEFT is into wall). So LEFT is invalid, so options are UP and DOWN.\n\nLet's check moving UP: current head at (6,1). UP would mean moving to row 5, column 1. Let's check row 5: \"#  SS  #\". So row 5, column 1 is ' ' (empty). Because row 5 is index 5. Let's index columns 0-7:\n\nRow 5: index 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is 'S', 3 is 'S', 4 is ' ', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So (5,1) is ' ', which is empty. So moving UP to (5,1) is safe. Is there a body part there? No. So that's a possible move.\n\nThen, moving DOWN: current head (6,1). DOWN would take to row 7, column 1. Row 7 is ########, so (7,1) is '#', a wall. So moving DOWN would hit the wall, game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo the only possible directions that don't hit walls are UP. Let's confirm.\n\nWait, current direction is LEFT, next direction can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT (but not RIGHT). Let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT: next head position (6,0) → wall → game over. So invalid.\n2. RIGHT: reverse direction, not allowed. So invalid.\n3. UP: next head (5,1). Check if that's a wall or body. (5,1) is ' ' (from row 5: \"#  SS  #\", so positions 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: S, 3:S, etc.) So (5,1) is empty. No collision. So safe.\n4. DOWN: next head (7,1) → wall (row 7 is all #), collision. So invalid.\n\nSo the only possible direction that's allowed and safe is UP. Let's check if moving UP would hit any part of the snake's body. The snake's body is made of 'S's. Let's list all the 'S' positions:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2) → S\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) → S\nRow 3: (3,1) → S\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) → S\nRow 5: (5,2), (5,3) → S\nRow 6: (6,2), (6,3) → S (since row 6 is \"# HS  A#\", so (6,1)=H, (6,2)=S, (6,3)=S)\n\nSo the body positions are all those (row, column) with 'S'. The next head position when moving UP is (5,1). Is (5,1) in any of the S positions? Let's check. The S positions in row 5 are (5,2) and (5,3). So (5,1) is not an S. So no collision with self. So moving UP is safe.\n\nIs there an apple at (5,1)? Let's check. The apples are 'A's. Let's list apple positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,5) → A\nRow 3: (3,5) → A\nRow 6: (6,5) → A\n\n(5,1) is not an apple. So moving UP would not eat an apple, but the snake would move there. The snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is the number of 'S' plus 1 (the head). Let's count the current length. The head is H (1), and the number of S's: let's count.\n\nRow 1: 2 S's\nRow 2: 3 S's\nRow 3: 1 S\nRow 4:4 S's\nRow5:2 S's\nRow6:2 S's (since (6,2) and (6,3) are S)\nTotal S's: 2+3+1+4+2+2=14. So current length is 14 +1=15. So when moving, the tail (the last S) would move if the snake doesn't eat an apple. But since we're not eating an apple here, the snake moves forward, and the tail is removed (so the body length remains the same). But that's handled by the game mechanics. Our task is just to choose a direction that's safe (no collision with walls or self), and preferably eat an apple if possible.\n\nBut in this case, moving UP is the only safe direction. Let's confirm again. Any other possibilities?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the positions. Let's recheck the head position. The head is in row 6, which is \"# HS  A#\". Let's parse that row (row 6, indexes 0-7):\n\nindex 0: '#'\nindex 1: 'H' → head at (6,1)\nindex 2: 'S' → (6,2)\nindex 3: 'S' → (6,3)\nindex 4: ' '\nindex 5: 'A' → (6,5)\nindex 6: ' '\nindex 7: '#'\n\nYes, correct. So head is (6,1).\n\nMoving UP would be row 5, column 1. Let's check row 5: \"#  SS  #\"\n\nRow 5 indexes:\n\n0: '#'\n1: ' '\n2: 'S'\n3: 'S'\n4: ' '\n5: ' '\n6: ' '\n7: '#'\n\nSo (5,1) is ' ', which is safe. No S there, no wall. So UP is safe.\n\nOther directions:\n\nLEFT → (6,0) → wall → die.\n\nDOWN → (7,1) → wall → die.\n\nRIGHT → reverse direction (current direction is LEFT, so can't go RIGHT). So not allowed. Even if it was allowed, (6,1) moving RIGHT would go to (6,2), which is 'S' (body). So collision with self. So even if allowed, it's a collision.\n\nSo the only possible direction is UP.\n\n\n########\n#SS   A#\n#SSS   #\n#S    A#\n#SSSS  #\n#  SS  #\n# HS  A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 6, column 1).  \n2. **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid).  \n3. **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or LEFT (RIGHT is reversed and invalid).  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (6,1) leads to (6,0), which is a wall (`#`). Collision with the wall would end the game. **Invalid**.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (6,1) leads to (7,1), which is a wall (`#`). Collision with the wall would end the game. **Invalid**.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP from (6,1) leads to (5,1). Checking row 5 (`#  SS  #`), (5,1) is an empty space (` `) with no snake body (`S`) or wall. This is a safe move.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only valid and safe direction is UP.  \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let me start by visualizing the board. The board is 8x8 with walls (#######) around. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: #SS   A#\nRow 2: #SS    #\nRow 3: #S    A#\nRow 4: #SSSS  #\nRow 5: # HSS  #\nRow 6: # SS  A#\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo the snake's head is 'H' in row 5. Let's find the exact position. Row 5 is \"# HSS  #\". Let's index the columns from 0 to 7 (since it's 8 characters, including the # at start and end). The row starts with #, then space, then H, then S, S, then spaces, then #. So columns in row 5:\n\nColumn 0: #\nColumn 1: space\nColumn 2: H (head position)\nColumn 3: S\nColumn 4: S\nColumn 5: space\nColumn 6: space\nColumn 7: #\n\nSo head is at (row 5, column 2). The current direction is UP. So the snake is moving upward. Let's check where the next move would be if we continue UP. Moving UP from (5,2) would take the head to (4,2). Let's check what's in row 4, column 2. Row 4 is \"#SSSS  #\". Let's index row 4:\n\nColumn 0: #\nColumn 1: S\nColumn 2: S\nColumn 3: S\nColumn 4: S\nColumn 5: space\nColumn 6: space\nColumn 7: #\n\nSo (4,2) is 'S' (snake's body). If the snake moves UP here, the head would collide with its own body, which ends the game. That's bad. So we can't go UP.\n\nNext, the snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is UP, so reversing would be DOWN. So we can't choose DOWN. So possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check LEFT. Moving LEFT from (5,2) would take the head to (5,1). What's in (5,1)? Row 5 is \"# HSS  #\", column 1 is a space. So that's a valid square (not wall or body). Let's check if that's safe. The next position (5,1) is a space. Then, after moving, the snake's body would follow. Since the snake is moving LEFT, the new head is (5,1), and the body parts would shift. But we need to make sure that (5,1) isn't a body part. The current body parts: let's list all S positions.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: #SS   A# → columns 1 and 2 are S (positions (1,1), (1,2))\nRow 2: #SS    # → columns 1 and 2 are S (positions (2,1), (2,2))\nRow 3: #S    A# → column 1 is S (position (3,1))\nRow 4: #SSSS  # → columns 1-4 are S (positions (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4))\nRow 5: # HSS  # → columns 3 and 4 are S (positions (5,3), (5,4))\nRow 6: # SS  A# → columns 1 and 2 are S (positions (6,1), (6,2))\n\nSo the body positions are all these (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,3), (5,4), (6,1), (6,2). The head is at (5,2). So moving LEFT to (5,1). (5,1) is not in the body positions (since body in row 5 is columns 3 and 4). So (5,1) is safe. Now, is there an apple there? Let's check row 5, column 1. No, row 5 has H at column 2, and the rest are spaces. So moving LEFT would just move the head to (5,1), no apple eaten. The snake's length remains the same (since no apple), and the body shifts.\n\nNow check RIGHT direction. Moving RIGHT from (5,2) would take the head to (5,3). (5,3) is S (from row 5: \"# HSS  #\", column 3 is S). So that's the snake's body. So moving RIGHT would cause a collision with the body. That's a game over. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT (safe) or UP (collision), RIGHT (collision), DOWN (reverse direction, not allowed). So the only safe direction is LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS   A#\n#SS    #\n#S    A#\n#SSSS  #\n# HSS  #\n# SS  A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (row 5, column 2), and the current direction is UP. Moving UP would lead the head to (row 4, column 2), which is occupied by the snake's body (S), causing a collision. Reversing direction (DOWN) is not allowed. Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 5, column 3), which is also the snake's body (S), causing a collision. The only safe direction is LEFT, which moves the head to (row 5, column 1), a valid empty space with no collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. The apples are 'A'. The current direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 34, which is well before the 100th epoch, so the game isn't ending yet.\n\nFirst, let's map out the positions. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SS   A# → So positions (1,1)=S, (1,2)=S, then (1,5)=A\nRow 2: #S     # → (2,1)=S\nRow 3: #S    A# → (3,1)=S, (3,5)=A\nRow 4: #SSSS  # → (4,1)=S, (4,2)=S, (4,3)=S, (4,4)=S\nRow 5: #HSSS  # → (5,1)=H, (5,2)=S, (5,3)=S, (5,4)=S\nRow 6: # SS  A# → (6,2)=S, (6,5)=A\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at (5,1) (row 5, column 1, assuming rows start at 0). The current direction is LEFT, which means the snake is moving left. Wait, moving left would mean the next position for the head would be (5,0), but that's a wall (since column 0 is all '#'). Oh, that's a problem! Because if the snake continues moving LEFT, the next move would take it into the wall (since column 0 is a wall), which would end the game. So we can't keep moving LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction, so from LEFT, the snake can't go RIGHT (since that's the opposite). So possible directions are UP or DOWN.\n\nWait, the movement rules: the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. But moving LEFT now would hit the wall. Let's confirm the head's position. The head is in row 5, column 1 (since row 5 is #HSSS  # → positions 0 is '#', 1 is 'H', 2 is 'S', 3 is 'S', 4 is 'S', 5-7 are spaces). So column 1 is H. Moving LEFT (towards column 0) would take it to (5,0), which is a wall (row 5, column 0 is '#'), so that's a collision. So moving LEFT is invalid (game over). So the player must choose either UP or DOWN.\n\nNow, let's check possible moves. Let's consider the possible directions: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (but RIGHT is reverse of LEFT, which is not allowed). So the options are UP or DOWN.\n\nFirst, let's check UP. The current direction is LEFT, so turning UP is allowed. The head is at (5,1). Moving UP would take it to (4,1). Let's check what's in (4,1). Looking at row 4: #SSSS  #. So (4,1) is 'S' (since row 4, column 1 is S). So if the snake moves UP, the head would go to (4,1), which is part of its own body. That's a collision (snake collides with itself), which would end the game. So UP is invalid.\n\nNext, check DOWN. Current direction is LEFT, turning DOWN is allowed. The head is at (5,1). Moving DOWN would take it to (6,1). Let's check row 6: # SS  A#. So row 6, column 0 is '#', column 1 is ' ' (space), column 2 is 'S', column 3 is ' ', column 4 is ' ', column 5 is 'A', column 6 is ' ', column 7 is '#'. So (6,1) is a space (empty). So moving DOWN to (6,1) would be safe. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head at (5,1). Next position if moving DOWN is (6,1). What's there? (6,1) is ' ' (from row 6: # SS  A# → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'). So (6,1) is empty. So that's a valid move. Then, the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is the number of 'S' and 'H' on the board. Let's count the snake's length:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: SS → 2 S\nRow 2: S → 1 S\nRow 3: S → 1 S\nRow 4: SSSS → 4 S\nRow 5: HSSS → 1 H + 3 S = 4 (H is head, S is body)\nRow 6: S → 1 S\nTotal S: 2+1+1+4+3+1 = 12. H is 1, so total length 13.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body part follows the previous one. Since the snake is moving in a direction, the tail (the last part) would move forward only if the snake doesn't eat an apple. But in this case, the next position (6,1) is not an apple, so the tail would move (i.e., the snake's length remains the same).\n\nSo moving DOWN would be safe. Are there any apples in the direction that we can reach? Let's see the positions of apples. The apples are at (1,5), (3,5), (6,5). So (1,5), (3,5), (6,5).\n\nThe head is at (5,1). If we move DOWN to (6,1), then next possible moves. Let's see if moving DOWN leads towards any apples. The apple at (6,5) is in row 6, column 5. From (6,1), moving RIGHT would approach that apple. But first, the immediate next move must be safe.\n\nSo the only valid directions are UP (invalid, body collision), DOWN (valid, empty space), LEFT (invalid, wall). So the correct direction is DOWN.\n\n\n########\n#SS   A#\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#SSSS  #\n#HSSS  #\n# SS  A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5,1) (row 5, column 1). The current direction is LEFT. Moving LEFT would take the head to (5,0), which is a wall (game-ending collision). The snake cannot reverse direction, so RIGHT is invalid. \n\nChecking UP: Moving UP would take the head to (4,1), which is occupied by the snake's own body (S), causing a self-collision (game over). \n\nChecking DOWN: Moving DOWN takes the head to (6,1), which is an empty space (safe). This avoids collisions with walls or the snake's body. \n\nThus, the only safe direction is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls as '#' around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body segments are 'S', and apples are 'A'. The current direction is DOWN, and the epoch is 35, which is well before the 100th, so the game isn't ending yet.\n\nFirst, I need to map out the positions of the snake's head, body, and the apples. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #S    A# (columns 1: 'S', 5: 'A')\nRow 2: #S     # (column 1: 'S')\nRow 3: #S    A# (column 1: 'S', 5: 'A')\nRow 4: #SSSS  # (columns 1-4: 'S')\nRow 5: #SSSS  # (columns 1-4: 'S')\nRow 6: #HSS  A# (column 1: 'H', 2-3: 'S', 5: 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at row 6, column 1 (since rows are 0-indexed from top, so row 6 is the 7th line). The current direction is DOWN, which means the snake is moving downward. But wait, in grid terms, moving DOWN would mean increasing the row index. Since the head is in row 6, moving DOWN would take it to row 7, which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). Oh, that's a problem! Because if the snake continues moving DOWN, the next move would be into the wall, causing a collision and the game ends. So the current direction is DOWN, but that's leading towards a wall. So the player must change direction to avoid that.\n\nNow, the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is DOWN, so the opposite direction is UP. So the snake can't turn directly to UP (since that's reversing). The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (but DOWN is into the wall). Wait, the allowed directions are the current direction or the two perpendicular directions, but not the opposite. So current direction is DOWN, so possible next directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (but DOWN is bad here). So the player must choose between LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check where the head is and possible moves.\n\nCurrent head position: (row 6, column 1). Let's confirm coordinates. Let's index rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7). Columns from left (column 0) to right (column 7). So each cell is (row, column).\n\nRow 6: #HSS  A# → columns 0 is '#', column 1 is 'H', column 2 is 'S', column 3 is 'S', columns 4 is ' ', column 5 is 'A', columns 6 and 7 are '#'. So head is at (6,1).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So next position if moving DOWN would be (7,1), which is a wall (row 7, column 1 is '#'). So moving DOWN is invalid (game over). So we must change direction.\n\nPossible directions: since current direction is DOWN, the snake can't reverse to UP. So possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT. Let's check those.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: the snake would move to (6,0). But column 0 is a wall (since row 6 starts with '#'), so (6,0) is a wall. So moving LEFT would hit the wall. That's also game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: the snake would move to (6,2). What's in (6,2)? Looking at row 6: #HSS  A#. So column 2 is 'S' (body of the snake). So moving RIGHT would cause the head to collide with the body (since (6,2) is 'S'). That's a self-collision, which ends the game. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Are there any other options? Wait, the possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, but the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is DOWN. So reversing would be UP, which is not allowed. So allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (but all of those are bad).\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the head's position. Let me double-check. The row 6 is \"#HSS  A#\". Let's count the columns:\n\nColumns 0: '#'\n\nColumn 1: 'H'\n\nColumn 2: 'S'\n\nColumn 3: 'S'\n\nColumn 4: ' ' (space)\n\nColumn 5: 'A'\n\nColumn 6: ' ' (since the row ends with '#', so column 7 is '#'). Wait, the row is \"#HSS  A#\" which is 8 characters (since the board is 8x8). Let's count:\n\nCharacters in row 6: 0:'#',1:'H',2:'S',3:'S',4:' ',5:'A',6:' ',7:'#'? Wait, no. Let's check the exact string: \"#HSS  A#\" has length 8. Let's break it down:\n\nIndex 0: '#'\n\n1: 'H'\n\n2: 'S'\n\n3: 'S'\n\n4: ' '\n\n5: ' '\n\n6: 'A'\n\n7: '#'\n\nAh, that's probably the case. Because \"#HSS  A#\" would be 8 characters: 0=#, 1=H, 2=S, 3=S, 4= (space), 5= (space), 6=A, 7=#. Oh! I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's correct that. So row 6: \"#HSS  A#\" → columns 0: '#', 1:H, 2:S, 3:S, 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6:A, 7:'#'. That makes more sense. So the head is at (6,1).\n\nSo, possible moves:\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. Next position if moving DOWN: (7,1). Row 7 is \"########\", so (7,1) is '#', which is a wall. So moving DOWN is invalid.\n\nPossible directions (can't reverse to UP, so allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. But DOWN is invalid. So LEFT and RIGHT.)\n\nLEFT: (6,0) → column 0 is '#', wall. Invalid.\n\nRIGHT: (6,2) → column 2 is 'S' (body). So moving into body → collision. Invalid.\n\nWait, what about direction UP? Since current direction is DOWN, the snake can't reverse to UP. Because reversing direction is not allowed. The rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So, if current direction is DOWN, turning to UP is reversing. So that's not allowed. So UP is not a valid direction input.\n\nSo all possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) lead to collision. So the snake is in a dead end. But maybe I made a mistake in the head's position. Let's check again.\n\nLet's re-express the board row by row, correctly:\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7: all #)\nRow 1: #S    A# → columns 0=#, 1=S, 2= , 3= , 4= , 5=A, 6= , 7=#\nRow 2: #S     # → columns 0=#, 1=S, 2= , 3= , 4= , 5= , 6= , 7=#\nRow 3: #S    A# → columns 0=#, 1=S, 2= , 3= , 4= , 5=A, 6= , 7=#\nRow 4: #SSSS  # → columns 0=#, 1=S, 2=S, 3=S, 4=S, 5= , 6= , 7=#\nRow 5: #SSSS  # → columns 0=#, 1=S, 2=S, 3=S, 4=S, 5= , 6= , 7=#\nRow 6: #HSS  A# → columns 0=#, 1=H, 2=S, 3=S, 4= , 5= , 6=A, 7=#\nRow 7: ######## (columns 0-7: all #)\n\nSo the head (H) is at (6,1). Let's list the snake's body segments. The snake's body is S's. Let's track the snake's path. Since the snake starts with length 1 (H) and grows by eating apples. The current snake's body is a chain of S's leading from H. Let's see:\n\nRow 6, column 1: H (head)\nRow 6, column 2: S (body)\nRow 6, column 3: S (body)\nRow 5, column 4: S (since row 5 is #SSSS  # → columns 1-4 are S: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4))\nRow 4, column 4: S (row 4: #SSSS  # → columns 1-4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4))\nRow 3, column 1: S (row 3, column 1)\nRow 2, column 1: S (row 2, column 1)\nRow 1, column 1: S (row 1, column 1)\n\nSo the snake's body is a long chain. The head is at (6,1), moving down. The next position if moving down is (7,1), which is a wall. So that's a problem.\n\nPossible directions:\n\n- UP: current direction is DOWN, so reversing is not allowed. So can't choose UP.\n\n- LEFT: (6,0) is wall. Can't.\n\n- RIGHT: (6,2) is S (body). So collision.\n\nWait, but what's the next cell if direction is UP? If the player chooses UP, even though it's reversing, but according to the rules, can the snake reverse direction? The rules state: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So, if the current direction is DOWN, the snake can't turn to UP. So UP is not allowed. So the player can't input UP.\n\nSo all possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) are invalid. So the snake is going to collide no matter what. But perhaps I made a mistake. Let's check if there's any other possible direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current direction is DOWN, but the snake's movement is such that when moving, the body follows. Let's think about the snake's movement. When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So, for example, if the head moves right, the next body segment (current head position) becomes S, and so on.\n\nBut in the current scenario, the head is at (6,1). The body segments are (6,2), (6,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) — but perhaps the order is different. Maybe the snake's body is arranged in a way that the next position after the head is (6,2), then (6,3), then (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). Wait, perhaps I need to reconstruct the snake's path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snake is arranged vertically. Let's think: the head is at (6,1). The body in row 6 is (6,2), (6,3). Then row 5 has (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). Row 4 has (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Row 3 has (3,1). Row 2 has (2,1). Row 1 has (1,1). That's a possible path. So the snake is moving down, so the direction is down, so the head was previously moving down from row 5 to row 6. Let's confirm:\n\nIf the snake was moving down, the previous head position would be (5,1), and then moved to (6,1) (current head). Then the body segments would be (5,1) → now S, (6,2) is S (previous position of (6,1) before that?), etc. But perhaps this is overcomplicating.\n\nThe key point is that the head is at (6,1), moving down. The next move in direction DOWN would take it to (7,1) (wall). Direction LEFT would take to (6,0) (wall). Direction RIGHT to (6,2) (body). Direction UP is reversing (current direction is DOWN), which is not allowed. So all options lead to collision. But that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the head's position.\n\nWait, the row 6 is \"#HSS  A#\". Let's count the characters again. Let's index columns 0-7.\n\nRow 6: characters are: [0]'#', [1]'H', [2]'S', [3]'S', [4]' ', [5]' ', [6]'A', [7]'#'. So (6,1) is H, (6,2) S, (6,3) S, (6,6) A.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So next position of the head is (6+1, 1) = (7,1). Row 7 is \"########\", so (7,1) is '#', which is a wall. So moving down is invalid.\n\nIf the direction is UP, the next position is (5,1). What's (5,1)? Row 5 is \"#SSSS  #\", so (5,1) is 'S' (body). So moving up would hit the body. But is UP allowed? Current direction is DOWN, so turning to UP is reversing. So the player can't input UP. So even if (5,1) is S, the player can't choose UP.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: (6,0) is '#', wall. Invalid.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: (6,2) is 'S', body. Invalid.\n\nSo all possible directions lead to collision, meaning the snake will die no matter what. But perhaps I missed an apple's position. Let's check the apples.\n\nApples are in row 1, column 5 (A), row 3, column 5 (A), row 6, column 6 (A). So three apples.\n\nIs there a way to reach an apple without collision? Let's see.\n\nIf the head could move right, but (6,2) is S. What if after moving, the body moves? Let's think about the movement. When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So, if the head moves right to (6,2), which is currently S (body), but after moving, the body would shift. Let's simulate:\n\nCurrent positions:\n\nHead: (6,1)\n\nBody segments (in order, from head to tail): (6,2), (6,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) — perhaps. Let's say the body is [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) ]\n\nIf the head moves RIGHT to (6,2), then the new head is (6,2). The first body segment moves to (6,1) (old head position). The second body segment moves to (6,2) (old first body position) — but wait, no. The movement is that each body part follows the one in front. So the head moves to new position, then each body part takes the position of the previous part. So:\n\nOriginal positions: H at (6,1), body segments S1 at (6,2), S2 at (6,3), S3 at (5,4), S4 at (4,4), S5 at (3,1), S6 at (2,1), S7 at (1,1).\n\nIf direction is RIGHT, new head position is (6,2). Then S1 moves to (6,1) (old H), S2 moves to (6,2) (old S1), S3 moves to (6,3) (old S2), S4 moves to (5,4) (old S3), etc. But in this case, the new head position (6,2) was previously S1. So after moving, the head is at (6,2), and S1 is at (6,1). So the head's new position is (6,2), which was S1's old position. So the head is now where S1 was, but S1 has moved to (6,1). So there's no collision because the body has moved. Wait, but that's how the snake normally moves. The body follows the head, so the head moving into a body position would only cause a collision if that body position is not the immediate next segment (i.e., if the snake is long enough that the head hits a part of the body that's not the first segment).\n\nWait, no. The collision occurs if the head moves into any cell that is occupied by the body (any S) after the movement. Because the body segments are moving. Let's clarify:\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves first. Then each body segment moves into the position of the segment in front of it. So, for example, if the snake is H-S-S (head followed by two body segments), and moves right, the new positions are S-H-S. So the head moves into the first S's position, which then moves into the second S's position, and the tail is lost (if not growing). So in that case, no collision.\n\nBut if the snake is longer, and the head moves into a position that is occupied by a body segment that is not the immediate next one (i.e., the head would collide with a part of the body that's not the first segment), then collision occurs.\n\nSo let's model the current snake's body. Let's list the positions of the snake's segments in order (from head to tail):\n\nHead: (6,1)\n\nSegment 1 (next to head): (6,2)\n\nSegment 2: (6,3)\n\nSegment 3: (5,3) [since row 5 is #SSSS  #. Let's check row 5: columns 1-4 are S. So (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). If the snake is moving down, perhaps the body is arranged as (6,1) → (6,2) → (6,3) → (5,3) → (5,2) → (5,1) → (4,1) → (3,1) → (2,1) → (1,1). Let's think of the snake's path:\n\nAssuming the snake was moving down, the previous head position would have been (5,1). Then it moved down to (6,1). So the body segments would be:\n\nHead: (6,1)\n\nSegment 1: (5,1) (previous head position)\n\nSegment 2: (5,2)\n\nSegment 3: (5,3)\n\nSegment 4: (5,4)\n\nSegment 5: (4,4)\n\nSegment 6: (4,3)\n\nSegment 7: (4,2)\n\nSegment 8: (4,1)\n\nSegment 9: (3,1)\n\nSegment 10: (2,1)\n\nSegment 11: (1,1)\n\nBut this is just a guess. The actual body positions are all the S's on the board. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1)\n\nRow 2: (2,1)\n\nRow 3: (3,1)\n\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nRow 6: (6,2), (6,3)\n\nSo all S positions are:\n\n(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nThe head is at (6,1).\n\nSo when the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the new body positions are the previous positions of the segments in front of them, except the tail, which is removed unless the snake ate an apple (in which case the tail remains, increasing length).\n\nSo, if the head moves in direction RIGHT to (6,2):\n\nNew head position: (6,2)\n\nThe body segments will be:\n\nSegment 1: (6,1) (old head position)\n\nSegment 2: (6,2) (old segment 1 position, which was (6,2) before moving. Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal positions (head and body):\n\nH: (6,1)\n\nBody segments (in order, from head to tail):\n\nSeg1: (6,2)\n\nSeg2: (6,3)\n\nSeg3: (5,4)\n\nSeg4: (4,4)\n\nSeg5: (4,3)\n\nSeg6: (4,2)\n\nSeg7: (4,1)\n\nSeg8: (3,1)\n\nSeg9: (2,1)\n\nSeg10: (1,1)\n\nWhen the head moves RIGHT to (6,2), the new head is (6,2). Then, Seg1 moves to (6,1) (old head), Seg2 moves to (6,2) (old Seg1), Seg3 moves to (6,3) (old Seg2), Seg4 moves to (5,4) (old Seg3), etc.\n\nSo after moving RIGHT, the new positions would be:\n\nH: (6,2)\n\nSeg1: (6,1)\n\nSeg2: (6,2) → wait, no. Because Seg2 was at (6,3) and moves to the old position of Seg1, which was (6,2). So Seg2's new position is (6,2). But the head is now at (6,2), so the head and Seg2 would be in the same cell, causing a collision. Oh! Because Seg2 (old position (6,3)) moves to Seg1's old position (6,2), which is where the head just moved to. So the head and Seg2 would collide.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the body segments are ordered such that Seg1 is the first segment after the head, Seg2 is after Seg1, etc. So when the head moves, each segment follows the one in front. So:\n\nOriginal positions:\n\nH: (6,1)\n\nSeg1: (6,2) (next to head)\n\nSeg2: (6,3) (next to Seg1)\n\nSeg3: (5,3) (next to Seg2)\n\nSeg4: (5,2) (next to Seg3)\n\nSeg5: (5,1) (next to Seg4)\n\nSeg6: (4,1) (next to Seg5)\n\nSeg7: (3,1) (next to Seg6)\n\nSeg8: (2,1) (next to Seg7)\n\nSeg9: (1,1) (next to Seg8)\n\nIf the head moves RIGHT to (6,2), then:\n\nNew H: (6,2)\n\nSeg1 moves to (6,1) (old H)\n\nSeg2 moves to (6,2) (old Seg1)\n\nSeg3 moves to (6,3) (old Seg2)\n\nSeg4 moves to (5,3) (old Seg3)\n\nSeg5 moves to (5,2) (old Seg4)\n\nSeg6 moves to (5,1) (old Seg5)\n\nSeg7 moves to (4,1) (old Seg6)\n\nSeg8 moves to (3,1) (old Seg7)\n\nSeg9 moves to (2,1) (old Seg8)\n\nTail (Seg9's old position (1,1)) is removed unless the snake ate an apple.\n\nIn this scenario, the new head is at (6,2), and Seg2 is moving to (6,2), which would overlap with the head. Hence, collision.\n\nSo moving RIGHT leads to collision with body.\n\nMoving DOWN leads to wall collision.\n\nMoving LEFT leads to wall collision.\n\nMoving UP is reversing direction, which is not allowed. So all options are invalid. But that can't be right. The snake must have a way to move. Perhaps I made a mistake in the head's position.\n\nWait, let's recheck the game board again. The user provided the game board as:\n\n########\n#S    A#\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#SSSS  #\n#SSSS  #\n#HSS  A#\n########\n\nLet's count the rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7).\n\nRow 0: ######## (8 #)\nRow 1: #S    A# → 8 characters: # S   (space)   (space)   (space) A # → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2: , 3: , 4: , 5:A, 6: , 7: #\nRow 2: #S     # → # S (space) (space) (space) (space) (space) # → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2: , 3: , 4: , 5: , 6: , 7: #\nRow 3: #S    A# → # S (space) (space) (space) A (space) # → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2: , 3: , 4: , 5:A, 6: , 7: #\nRow 4: #SSSS  # → # S S S S (space) (space) # → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 5: , 6: , 7: #\nRow 5: #SSSS  # → same as row 4: columns 1-4: S\nRow 6: #HSS  A# → # H S S (space) (space) A # → columns 0: #, 1:H, 2:S, 3:S, 4: , 5: , 6:A, 7: #\nRow 7: ######## \n\nSo the head is at row 6, column 1 (6,1).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So the next move in direction DOWN would take the head to (7,1), which is a wall. So that's invalid.\n\nPossible directions:\n\n- UP: (5,1). What's at (5,1)? Row 5 is #SSSS  # → column 1 is S. So (5,1) is S. So moving UP would take the head to (5,1), which is a body segment. But can we move UP? Current direction is DOWN, so UP is reverse. The rules say the snake cannot reverse direction. So UP is not allowed. So even if (5,1) is S, the player can't choose UP.\n\n- LEFT: (6,0) is # → wall. Invalid.\n\n- RIGHT: (6,2) is S → body. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (6,2), which is a body segment. So collision.\n\nSo all possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) lead to collision, and UP is not allowed. So the snake has no valid moves. Therefore, no matter what direction the player chooses, the game ends. But the question is to choose a direction from LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. So perhaps the answer is that all directions are invalid, but the player must choose one. But according to the example, the direction is chosen even if it leads to collision. So the answer would be any of the directions, but perhaps the player should choose the one that allows the snake to survive, but in this case, there's none.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in the body positions. Let's think again. When the snake moves, the body follows. So if the head moves right to (6,2), which is currently S (body), but after moving, the body segments shift. Let's say the snake's body is arranged such that (6,2) is the segment immediately behind the head. So when the head moves right, the first body segment moves into the old head position (6,1), and the next segments follow. So the new head is (6,2), and the first body segment is (6,1), which was previously the head. So (6,2) was the first body segment, but after moving, the head is there, and the first body is at (6,1). So there's no collision because the body has moved.\n\nWait, this is the normal movement of the snake. For example, in the example given in the problem statement:\n\nOriginal board:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN.\n\nAfter moving DOWN, the head moves from (3,1) (assuming H is in row 3, column 1) to (4,1). The body (S in row 2, column 1) moves to (3,1), and the new body is added. The example shows that after moving down, the H is at (4,1), and S is in row 3, column 1, etc. So the body follows the head.\n\nSo in the example, the head moves into a new position, and the body segments follow. So if the head moves into a position that was the first body segment, that's okay, because the body segment moves to the old head position. So no collision.\n\nSo let's apply this to our current scenario.\n\nCurrent head position: (6,1)\n\nBody segments: The S's adjacent to H are (6,2) and (6,3). Let's assume the body is arranged as follows (from head to tail):\n\nHead: (6,1)\n\nSeg1: (6,2)\n\nSeg2: (6,3)\n\nSeg3: (5,3)\n\nSeg4: (5,2)\n\nSeg5: (5,1)\n\nSeg6: (4,1)\n\nSeg7: (3,1)\n\nSeg8: (2,1)\n\nSeg9: (1,1)\n\nSo when the head moves RIGHT to (6,2), the new head is (6,2). Seg1 moves to (6,1) (old head position). Seg2 moves to (6,2) (old Seg1 position). Seg3 moves to (6,3) (old Seg2 position). Seg4 moves to (5,3) (old Seg3 position). Etc.\n\nWait, but Seg2 moving to (6,2) (old Seg1 position) would mean Seg2 is now at (6,2), which is where the new head is. That would cause a collision between the head and Seg2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the body segments are ordered such that Seg1 is the segment immediately after the head, so when the head moves, Seg1 takes the old head position, and Seg2 takes Seg1's old position, etc. So in this case, if the head is at (6,1), Seg1 at (6,2), Seg2 at (5,2), Seg3 at (5,1), etc. Then moving right to (6,2) would have Seg1 move to (6,1), Seg2 move to (6,2), which would be the new head's position, causing collision.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snake's body is arranged in a way that moving right is possible. Let's think of the snake's movement.\n\nIf the current direction is DOWN, and the head is at (6,1), then the previous position of the head was (5,1) (since moving down from (5,1) to (6,1)). So the body segments are:\n\nHead: (6,1)\n\nSeg1: (5,1) (previous head position)\n\nSeg2: (5,2)\n\nSeg3: (5,3)\n\nSeg4: (5,4)\n\nSeg5: (4,4)\n\nSeg6: (4,3)\n\nSeg7: (4,2)\n\nSeg8: (4,1)\n\nSeg9: (3,1)\n\nSeg10: (2,1)\n\nSeg11: (1,1)\n\nSo when the head moves RIGHT to (6,2), the new head is (6,2). Seg1 moves to (6,1) (old head). Seg2 moves to (5,1) (old Seg1). Seg3 moves to (5,2) (old Seg2). Seg4 moves to (5,3) (old Seg3). Seg5 moves to (5,4) (old Seg4). Seg6 moves to (4,4) (old Seg5). Seg7 moves to (4,3) (old Seg6). Seg8 moves to (4,2) (old Seg7). Seg9 moves to (4,1) (old Seg8). Seg10 moves to (3,1) (old Seg9). Seg11 moves to (2,1) (old Seg10). The tail (old Seg11 position (1,1)) is removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nIn this scenario, the new head position (6,2) is empty (since previously, (6,2) was not part of the body). Wait, but according to the current board, row 6 has \"#HSS  A#\", so (6,2) is 'S'. So in the current state, (6,2) is a body segment (Seg1). So when the head moves to (6,2), which is Seg1's current position, but Seg1 is moving to (6,1) (old head position). So after the move, the head is at (6,2), and Seg1 is at (6,1). So (6,2) is now the head, and Seg1 is at (6,1). So there's no collision because Seg1 has moved. The body segment that was at (6,2) (Seg1) has moved to (6,1), so the head can occupy (6,2) without collision.\n\nAh! That's the key. The body segments move after the head. So the head moves into a position that was a body segment, but that body segment has moved to the previous head position. So no collision occurs.\n\nSo let's re-express:\n\nCurrent positions:\n\nHead (H) at (6,1).\n\nBody segments (S) at:\n\nSeg1: (6,2) (current position)\n\nSeg2: (6,3) (current position)\n\nSeg3: (5,4) (current position, from row 5: #SSSS  # → (5,4) is S)\n\nSeg4: (4,4) (row 4: #SSSS  # → (4,4) is S)\n\nSeg5: (3,1) (row 3: #S    A# → (3,1) is S)\n\nSeg6: (2,1) (row 2: #S     # → (2,1) is S)\n\nSeg7: (1,1) (row 1: #S    A# → (1,1) is S)\n\nWhen the head moves RIGHT to (6,2), the new head position is (6,2). Then, each body segment moves to the position of the segment in front of it:\n\nSeg1 moves from (6,2) to (6,1) (old head position).\n\nSeg2 moves from (6,3) to (6,2) (old Seg1 position).\n\nSeg3 moves from (5,4) to (6,3) (old Seg2 position)? No, that's not right. The movement is sequential. The head moves first, then Seg1 moves to where the head was, Seg2 moves to where Seg1 was, and so on. So:\n\nNew head: (6,2) (moved right from (6,1))\n\nSeg1: (6,1) (old head position)\n\nSeg2: (6,2) (old Seg1 position) → wait, no. Seg1 was at (6,2), so after moving to (6,1), Seg2 (which was at (6,3)) moves to (6,2), which is now the new head's position. That would cause a collision between the head and Seg2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the body segments are arranged in a way that (6,2) is not the immediate next segment. Let's consider that the snake is moving down, so the body is trailing behind. The head is at (6,1), which was previously at (5,1) (row 5, column 1). So Seg1 is at (5,1), Seg2 at (5,2), Seg3 at (5,3), Seg4 at (5,4), Seg5 at (4,4), Seg6 at (4,3), Seg7 at (4,2), Seg8 at (4,1), Seg9 at (3,1), Seg10 at (2,1), Seg11 at (1,1).\n\nIn this case, the current head is (6,1), Seg1 is (5,1), Seg2 is (5,2), etc. So the S's in row 6, columns 2 and 3 are not part of the snake's body. But according to the game board, row 6 has \"#HSS  A#\", so (6,2) and (6,3) are S's, which must be part of the body. So the snake's body includes those positions.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps the key is to look for apples and possible paths. The apples are at (1,5), (3,5), (6,6). The head is at (6,1). To reach (6,6), the head would need to move right several times. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head: (6,1). To reach (6,6), need to move right 5 times (columns 1→2→3→4→5→6). Let's check if those cells are available.\n\n(6,2): S (body)\n\n(6,3): S (body)\n\n(6,4): ' ' (empty)\n\n(6,5): ' ' (empty)\n\n(6,6): A (apple)\n\nSo if the snake can move right, then right again, etc., avoiding collision.\n\nBut first move right: (6,2). If that's possible (no collision), then next move right to (6,3), and so on.\n\nBut according to the movement rules, when the snake moves right, the body follows. So the first move right would take the head to (6,2), which is currently S (body). But after moving, the body segment that was at (6,2) moves to (6,1) (old head position). So the new head is at (6,2), and the body segment is now at (6,1). So (6,2) is now head, and (6,1) is body. No collision.\n\nThen, next move right (direction RIGHT again), head moves to (6,3), which was S (body). The body segment at (6,3) moves to (6,2) (old head position). So again, no collision.\n\nThen, next move right to (6,4), which is empty. No problem.\n\nThen to (6,5), empty.\n\nThen to (6,6), which is an apple. Eating it would increase the score and grow the snake.\n\nSo the first step is to move RIGHT, even though (6,2) is S, but after movement, the body shifts, so no collision.\n\nSo the correct direction to choose is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#S    A#\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#SSSS  #\n#SSSS  #\n#HSS  A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at row 6, column 1. The current direction is DOWN, but moving DOWN would take the head to row 7, column 1, which is a wall (game over). The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid). \n\nAnalyzing other options:\n- **LEFT**: Would move the head to row 6, column 0 (a wall, game over).\n- **RIGHT**: Moves the head to row 6, column 2. Initially, this cell is 'S' (body), but when the snake moves, the body segments shift: the head moves to (6,2), the first body segment moves to the old head position (6,1), and subsequent body segments follow. This avoids collision, as the body segment vacates (6,2) to follow the head.\n\nThus, moving RIGHT is the only viable direction to avoid immediate collision and potentially reach apples.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, let's start by understanding the current game board. The user provided the board, so I should repeat that first.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#  AA  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the current epoch is 1. The snake's head is 'H' at position (4, 3) if we count rows from top as 0. Let's confirm the positions. The rows are 0 to 7. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  AA  # → columns 2 and 3 are 'A's (since indexes start at 1 inside the walls)\nRow 2: #    A # → column 4 is 'A'\nRow 3: #      # → empty\nRow 4: #  H   # → column 3 is 'H'\nRows 5,6: #      # → empty\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo the head is at row 4, column 3. The current direction is UP, meaning the snake is moving upwards. Since the snake can't reverse direction, if current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because turning down would be reversing, which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's think about where the head will move next based on the direction chosen. The snake moves one square in the direction. Let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Current direction is UP. If we keep moving UP, the head will go to row 3, column 3 (since moving up from row 4, column 3 → row 3). Let's check what's there. Row 3 is \"#      #\", so column 3 is empty. So moving UP here would be safe. The snake's body isn't there yet because the snake is length 1 (only head). So no collision with self. Also, not hitting a wall. So moving UP would be possible. But is there an apple there? No, row 3, column 3 is empty. So no apple eaten, snake doesn't grow.\n\n2. Direction LEFT: moving left from (4,3) would go to (4,2). Let's check row 4: \"#  H   #\", so column 2 is empty (since H is at 3). So (4,2) is empty. So moving left is possible. No collision. No apple here.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT: moving right from (4,3) would go to (4,4). Check row 4: \"#  H   #\", so column 4 is empty. So (4,4) is empty. No apple, safe.\n\n4. Direction DOWN: current direction is UP, so can't reverse to DOWN. So this is invalid.\n\nNow, the snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's look for apples on the board. The apples are in row 1, columns 2 and 3 (positions (1,2) and (1,3)), and row 2, column 4 (position (2,4)).\n\nThe head is at (4,3). Let's see the path to the apples. If the snake continues moving UP, next step is (3,3). Then, if it continues UP again, next would be (2,3). Let's check row 2: \"#    A #\". So row 2, column 3 is empty (since A is at column 4). So (2,3) is empty. Then moving UP again would take it to (1,3). Row 1: \"#  AA  #\", column 3 is 'A' here. Oh, that's an apple! So if the snake keeps moving UP, in the next steps, it can reach that apple. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head at (4,3), direction UP.\n\nEpoch 1: current state. Then, when we choose direction (let's say we keep UP), the next move (epoch 2) would be to (3,3). No apple. Then in epoch 3, if direction is still UP, head moves to (2,3). No apple. Epoch 4: direction UP, head moves to (1,3). That's an apple! So eating that apple would increase the score. \n\nAlternatively, are there apples that are closer? Let's check other directions. For example, if we turn LEFT. From (4,3) moving left to (4,2). Then, where's the next apple? The apples are in row 1 (columns 2,3) and row 2 (column 4). So (4,2) is left, but that's not near any apple. If we turn RIGHT to (4,4), then next step could be moving UP towards row 3,4. Let's see, row 2, column 4 has an apple. So (4,4) → moving UP to (3,4) → then UP to (2,4) which is the apple. That's two steps. Let's count:\n\nCurrent head (4,3). If direction is RIGHT, move to (4,4) (epoch 2). Then, if direction is UP (since can't reverse from RIGHT, but current direction after moving RIGHT would be RIGHT, so next direction can be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (but not DOWN). Wait, the direction after each move is the direction you input. So when you choose direction RIGHT, the snake's new direction is RIGHT. Then, the next move would be in the RIGHT direction. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\"\n\nAh, right. So each time, the player provides a direction input. The snake can change direction, but cannot reverse. So current direction is UP. The possible directions the player can input are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because DOWN is reversing.\n\nSo, if the player inputs UP, the snake moves UP (new direction is UP). If the player inputs LEFT, the snake moves LEFT (new direction is LEFT). If the player inputs RIGHT, new direction is RIGHT.\n\nSo, the direction after the move is the direction input by the player. So the next move's possible directions depend on the current input.\n\nSo, for example, if in this step, we choose to move RIGHT, then the new direction is RIGHT. Then, next step, the possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN (since can't reverse LEFT). But that's maybe not important for this step. Let's focus on the immediate next move.\n\nOur goal is to eat apples. Let's check where the apples are. The apples are at:\n\n- (1,2) (row 1, column 2)\n- (1,3) (row 1, column 3)\n- (2,4) (row 2, column 4)\n\nThe head is at (4,3). Let's calculate the distance to each apple.\n\nDistance to (1,3): since moving up, each step up reduces row by 1. From row 4 to row 1 is 3 steps up. So (4,3) → (3,3) → (2,3) → (1,3). So 3 steps. That apple is in row 1, column 3.\n\nDistance to (1,2): (4,3) → (3,3) → (2,3) → (1,3) → (1,2) (left). That's 4 steps.\n\nDistance to (2,4): (4,3) → (4,4) (right) → (3,4) (up) → (2,4) (up). So 3 steps. So if we move right first, then up, that's 3 steps.\n\nSo the apples at (1,3) and (2,4) are both 3 steps away. Let's see which is more accessible.\n\nIf we keep moving UP, next step is (3,3). Then, next step, if we continue UP, (2,3). Then next step, (1,3) which is an apple. So that's 3 steps (epoch 1 → 2 → 3 → 4). So in epoch 4, the head would reach (1,3) and eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose to move RIGHT now (epoch 1's input), the head moves to (4,4). Then, in epoch 2, if we choose UP, the head moves to (3,4). Then epoch 3, choose UP again, head moves to (2,4) which is the apple. So that's 3 steps (epoch 1: RIGHT, epoch 2: UP, epoch 3: UP). So same number of steps.\n\nBut which path is safer? Let's check for collisions. Since the snake is length 1 (only head), there's no body to collide with. So as long as the head doesn't hit the walls, it's safe. The walls are the first and last rows (0 and 7) and first and last columns (0 and 7, since the board is 8x8, the inner grid is 6x6, from row 1 to 6 and column 1 to 6).\n\nSo (4,3) is in row 4 (which is 1-6) and column 3 (1-6). Moving up to (3,3) is safe. (3 is between 1-6). Then (2,3) is safe. (1,3) is row 1, column 3: row 1 is within 1-6, column 3 is within 1-6. So that's safe.\n\nIf we move right to (4,4): column 4 is within 1-6. Then up to (3,4), (2,4): all safe.\n\nSo both paths are safe. Now, which direction should we choose? Let's check if there's any immediate apple in the next move. The current head is at (4,3). The adjacent squares are:\n\nUP: (3,3) → empty.\n\nDOWN: (5,3) → empty (but can't move down because current direction is UP, reversing is not allowed).\n\nLEFT: (4,2) → empty.\n\nRIGHT: (4,4) → empty.\n\nNone of the adjacent squares have apples, so the snake won't eat an apple in the next move regardless of direction. So the next step's move won't get an apple. The question is which direction leads towards an apple.\n\nSince the current direction is UP, and moving UP leads towards the apple at (1,3), which is directly above. So continuing in the current direction (UP) seems logical. Because changing direction (LEFT or RIGHT) might take longer, but in this case, both paths take the same steps. However, perhaps moving UP is better because it's the current direction, and there's no obstacle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better path. Let's think again. The snake's length is 1, so when it moves, the body doesn't exist yet. So when the head moves, there's no body to track. So the next state after moving UP would have the head at (3,3), and since the snake didn't eat an apple, the length remains 1 (so no body). So the new board would have H at (3,3), and the previous H position (4,3) becomes empty (since no body yet).\n\nSo the best direction here is to continue moving UP towards the apple above. So the answer should be UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  AA  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at row 4, column 3 (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The goal is to move toward apples ('A') to increase the score. \n\nApples are located at:\n- Row 1, column 2\n- Row 1, column 3\n- Row 2, column 4\n\nMoving UP (current direction) will take the head to row 3, column 3 (empty, safe). Continuing UP in subsequent steps will lead the head to row 2, column 3 (empty, safe), then row 1, column 3 (which contains an apple). This path is straightforward and avoids walls or self-collision. \n\nOther directions (LEFT\/RIGHT) also lead to safe, empty squares but do not directly approach the nearest apple as efficiently as continuing UP. Since the snake starts moving UP and reversing (DOWN) is invalid, UP remains the optimal choice to reach the apple at row 1, column 3.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, let's start by understanding the current game board. The board is 8x8 with walls around the edges (marked with #). The snake's head is 'H', and there are apples 'A' on the board. The current direction is UP, and the epoch is 2.\n\nFirst, I'll repeat the current game board as instructed. Let's look at each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #  AA  # (so positions (1,2) and (1,3) are A)\nRow 2: #    A # (position (2,4) is A)\nRow 3: #  H   # (position (3,2) is H)\nRow 4: #      # (empty)\nRow 5: #      # (empty)\nRow 6: #      # (empty)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head is at (3,2). The current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving upward. Since the snake can't reverse direction, if the current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is the reverse of UP).\n\nWait, the rules say the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each possible direction to see if moving that way would cause a collision, and if it would eat an apple.\n\nFirst, let's find the current head position. The head is in row 3 (since rows are 0 to 7, top to bottom). So row 3, column 2 (columns 0 to 7, left to right). Let's confirm: row 3 is \"#  H   #\", so the H is at index 3 (row 3) and column 2 (since positions 0: #, 1: space, 2: H, 3: space, etc.). So (row, column) = (3,2).\n\nCurrent direction is UP. So if the snake continues moving UP, the next head position would be row 3 - 1 = row 2, column 2. Let's check row 2: \"#    A #\". The columns in row 2 are 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: A, 5: space, 6: #. So (2,2) is a space. So moving UP would take the head to (2,2), which is empty. No collision. But is there an apple there? No. The apples in row 2 are at (2,4). So moving UP would not eat an apple.\n\nNext, direction LEFT. The snake's head is at (3,2). Moving LEFT would take it to column 2-1=1. So (3,1). Let's check row 3: \"#  H   #\", which is columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: H, 3: space, 4: space, 5: space, 6: #. So (3,1) is a space. So moving LEFT would be to (3,1), which is empty. No collision. No apple there.\n\nDirection RIGHT. Head is at (3,2). Moving RIGHT would take it to column 2+1=3. So (3,3). Check row 3: \"#  H   #\", column 3 is a space. So (3,3) is empty. No collision. No apple.\n\nWait, but the snake's length is 1 (since it starts with length 1, and hasn't eaten any apples yet). So the body is just the head. So when moving, the head moves to a new position, and since the length is 1, the previous head position becomes empty. So no body parts to collide with yet.\n\nNow, let's check if any direction leads to a wall. The walls are the edges. The head is at (3,2). Let's see possible moves:\n\nUP: (2,2). Row 2 is within 1-6 (since rows 0 and 7 are walls). So (2,2) is safe.\n\nLEFT: (3,1). Column 1 is within 1-6 (columns 0 and 7 are walls). So (3,1) is safe.\n\nRIGHT: (3,3). Column 3 is within 1-6. Safe.\n\nDOWN: Current direction is UP, so can't go DOWN (reverse direction). So that's invalid.\n\nNow, the snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's look where the apples are. The apples are in row 1: (1,2) and (1,3), row 2: (2,4).\n\nSo let's think about the path to reach the apples. The head is at (3,2). Let's see the positions of the apples:\n\nApple 1: (1,2) (row 1, column 2)\nApple 2: (1,3) (row 1, column 3)\nApple 3: (2,4) (row 2, column 4)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. If the snake continues moving UP, next head is (2,2). Then, from (2,2), possible directions (can't reverse, which would be DOWN now if current direction is UP). So next possible directions from (2,2) (if moving UP again) would be (1,2), which is Apple 1. Oh! Because (2,2) moving UP would be row 1, column 2. That's the position of the first apple. So if the snake moves UP now (current direction is UP, so next direction can be UP), then in the next move (epoch 3), the head would be at (2,2). Then, if it continues UP (epoch 4), head moves to (1,2), which is an apple. Then it would eat that apple, grow, and score increases.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake changes direction to RIGHT now (current direction UP, next direction RIGHT is allowed). Then, moving RIGHT would take the head to (3,3). Then, from there, possible directions (can't reverse, which would be LEFT if current direction is RIGHT). So next possible directions: RIGHT, UP, DOWN. Let's see if (3,3) can reach apples. The apple at (2,4) is in row 2, column 4. So (3,3) moving UP would reach (2,3). Then moving RIGHT to (2,4), which is the apple. So that's another path.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would take to (3,1). From there, perhaps moving UP towards row 2, column 1, but there's no apple there.\n\nSo which direction is better? Let's think step by step.\n\nCurrent epoch is 2. The game ends after epoch 100, so we have time, but we need to eat apples asap.\n\nIf the snake moves UP now (current direction UP), next head position (epoch 3) is (2,2). Then, in epoch 3, the direction can still be UP (since the current direction would be UP again). Then, moving UP again (epoch 4), head is at (1,2), which is an apple. So that's two moves to reach an apple.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT now (direction RIGHT), head moves to (3,3) (epoch 3). Then, in epoch 3, the current direction is RIGHT, so next direction can't be LEFT. So possible directions: RIGHT, UP, DOWN. If it moves UP from (3,3) (epoch 3's direction is RIGHT, so can change to UP), then in epoch 4, head is at (2,3). Then, moving RIGHT (epoch 4's direction is UP, so can change to RIGHT) to (2,4), which is the apple (epoch 5). So that's three moves to reach that apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP first (epoch 2 direction UP) leads to (2,2) (epoch 3). Then, moving UP again (epoch 3 direction UP) to (1,2) (epoch 4) which is an apple. That's two moves. So that's faster.\n\nSo the best direction is to continue moving UP. Because that leads to the apple in (1,2) in two steps. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head (3,2). Move UP (direction UP) → (2,2) (epoch 3). Then, move UP again → (1,2) (epoch 4). (1,2) is an apple. So when the head moves into (1,2), it eats the apple. So the next state would have the head at (1,2), and the body would be (2,2) (since the snake grows by 1 when eating an apple). The score increases by 1.\n\nSo moving UP now is the best option. Let's check if there's any collision. Moving UP from (3,2) to (2,2): (2,2) is empty (row 2 is \"#    A #\", so column 2 is a space). So no collision. So it's safe.\n\nOther directions: moving LEFT or RIGHT would take the snake away from the nearest apple, so UP is better.\n\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 3, column 2).  \n2. **Current Direction**: UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid).  \n3. **Apples**: Located at (1,2), (1,3), and (2,4).  \n4. **Goal**: Move toward apples to maximize score while avoiding collisions.  \n\n### Possible Directions:\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (3,2) leads to (2,2) (empty, no collision). From (2,2), continuing UP would reach (1,2) (an apple in the next move). This path directly targets the nearest apple.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT to (3,1) (empty, no collision) but no apple nearby. This direction does not lead toward apples.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT to (3,3) (empty, no collision) but requires additional moves to reach the apple at (2,4).  \n\n### Best Choice:\nMoving UP is optimal as it directly approaches the nearest apple at (1,2) in the fewest steps, avoiding collisions and maximizing score potential.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. Let's start by understanding the current game state.\n\nFirst, let's look at the game board. The user provided the current board, so I should visualize it. The board is 8x8 with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  AA  # (so positions (1,2) and (1,3) are apples)\nRow 2: #  H A #. Let's parse this. The row starts with #, then two spaces, then H, then a space, then A, then #. So positions in row 2 (y=2, since rows are 0-7) are: (2,1)=space, (2,2)=H (head), (2,3)=space, (2,4)=A (apple). The rest are spaces or the wall.\nRows 3-6: all # at the ends, with spaces in between. So the snake's head is at (2,2) (assuming rows are y and columns x, with (0,0) being top-left, maybe? Or maybe (row, column) where row 0 is top, column 0 is left). Let's confirm: in row 2, the characters are #, space, space, H, space, A, space, #. Wait, no. Let's index each row's columns from 0 to 7. So row 2 is \"#  H A #\". Let's split into characters:\n\nIndex 0: '#'\nIndex 1: ' '\nIndex 2: ' '\nIndex 3: 'H' (head)\nIndex 4: ' '\nIndex 5: 'A' (apple)\nIndex 6: ' '\nIndex 7: '#'\n\nSo the head is at (row 2, column 3). The current direction is UP. Since the snake is moving UP, the next position the head would move to is row 2 - 1 = row 1, column 3. Because moving UP decreases the row number (assuming rows go top to bottom, so moving up is towards row 0).\n\nLet's check the next position if the snake continues UP. The next head position would be (row 1, column 3). Let's check what's there. Row 1 is \"#  AA  #\". Columns 0-7: 0='#', 1=' ', 2='A', 3='A', 4=' ', 5=' ', 6=' ', 7='#'. So (row 1, column 3) is 'A' (an apple). So if the snake moves UP, it will eat that apple. That's good because it increases the score and the snake grows.\n\nBut wait, the snake's current direction is UP. The player can choose to change direction, but can't reverse. Since current direction is UP, the snake can't go DOWN (reverse). So possible directions are UP (current), LEFT, RIGHT. Because reversing (to DOWN) is not allowed.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each.\n\nFirst, UP: next head position (1,3). What's there? As row 1 is \"#  AA  #\", column 3 is 'A' (apple). So eating that apple. Then the snake grows. The new head is at (1,3), and the old head (2,3) becomes part of the body (since the snake grows, the body will extend). That's a good move because it gets an apple.\n\nWhat if we choose LEFT? Current head is (2,3). Moving LEFT would take it to (2,2). What's there? In row 2, column 2 is ' ' (space). So no apple. The snake moves there, but since it's not an apple, the tail (since the snake's length is 1, moving to a new position would just have the head there, no body yet? Wait, the snake starts with length 1 (just the head). Each time it eats an apple, it grows. So current length is 1 (only head). So when moving, if it doesn't eat an apple, the head moves, and since the length is 1, there's no body. So after moving LEFT, the head is at (2,2), and the previous position (2,3) becomes empty. But that's a space, no collision. So that's safe, but no apple.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: head moves to (2,4). What's (2,4)? In row 2, column 4 is ' ' (since row 2 is \"#  H A #\": columns 0-7: 0='#', 1=' ', 2=' ', 3='H', 4=' ', 5='A', 6=' ', 7='#'. So (2,4) is a space. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,4), which is empty. No apple, so no growth. That's safe but no score.\n\nSo the best option is to move UP, which would eat the apple at (1,3). Because that's the only direction that gets an apple. Let's confirm the movement.\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving UP. The next position is (1,3), which is an 'A'. So the snake eats it. The new head is at (1,3). The previous head (2,3) becomes part of the body (since the snake's length increases by 1, from 1 to 2). So the body would be at (2,3) as 'S', and head at (1,3) as 'H'. The apple at (1,3) is consumed, so that position becomes 'H', and the other apples remain. Let's check the other apples: row 1 has (1,2) and (1,3) as 'A's. So (1,3) was an apple, which is now eaten. So row 1 would have (1,2) as 'A' and (1,3) as 'H'. The row 2's (2,5) is 'A' (since row 2 is \"#  H A #\": (2,5) is 'A'). So after moving UP, the new board would have:\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: #  A H # (since (1,2) is 'A', (1,3) is 'H')\nRow 2: #  S A # (since (2,3) was H, now S)\nRow 3: ... (unchanged)\nSo that's correct. No collision, and the snake grows. That's a safe and beneficial move.\n\nOther directions don't get an apple. So the best choice is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  AA  #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP, and the current epoch is 3. The snake can move in directions UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since reversing to DOWN is not allowed). \n\n- **Moving UP**: The head is at (row 2, column 3). Moving UP would take it to (row 1, column 3), which is an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, the snake grows in length, and this move is safe (no collision with walls or itself).\n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (row 2, column 2), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.\n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (row 2, column 4), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.\n\nThe optimal choice is to move UP to eat the apple and grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, let's start by understanding the current game board and the situation.\n\nThe game board is 8x8 with walls as #. Let me write down the current board:\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: #  HA  #\nRow 2: #  S A #\nRow 3: #      #\nRow 4: #   A  #\nRow 5: #      #\nRow 6: #      #\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo the snake's head is at (1,3) because row 1 (since rows are 0-indexed) has 'H' in position 3. Let's confirm: row 1 is \"#  HA  #\", which translates to positions 0: #, 1:  , 2:  , 3: H, 4: A, 5:  , 6:  , 7: #. So H is at (row 1, column 3). The body 'S' is in row 2, column 2: row 2 is \"#  S A #\", so positions 0: #, 1:  , 2: S, 3:  , 4: A, 5:  , 6:  , 7: #. So the body is at (2,2).\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. Since direction can't be reversed, the possible directions the player can choose are directions that are not the opposite of UP. The opposite of UP is DOWN, so the player can't choose DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe snake's next move depends on the current direction. Wait, no. The current direction is UP, but the player can input a new direction (as long as it's not the reverse). So the next movement direction is the direction the player chooses, as long as it's allowed.\n\nThe snake's movement: when the player inputs a direction, the snake changes direction (if allowed) and moves one square in that direction.\n\nFirst, let's track the snake's current position. The head is at (1,3). The body is at (2,2). Since the snake's length is 2 (H and S), right? Because when you start with length 1, each apple increases length by 1. Let's check how many apples have been eaten. The current epoch is 4. The game starts with 3 apples. Let's see: in the example given, when you eat an apple, the snake grows. The initial snake has length 1. So each apple eaten adds 1 to the length.\n\nBut let's see the current board. The snake has H and S, so length 2. So that means the snake has eaten 1 apple so far (since initial length 1, 1 apple eaten → length 2). So current score is 1.\n\nNow, the snake is moving in UP direction. But the player can change direction to UP (continue), LEFT, or RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse of UP and not allowed). Let's check where each direction would take the head next.\n\nCurrent head position is (1,3). Let's get the coordinates right. Let's index rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7). Columns from left (0) to right (7). So (row, column).\n\nCurrent head (H) is at row 1, column 3.\n\nIf the direction is UP (current direction), the next head position would be row 0, column 3. But row 0 is all # (walls). So moving UP would hit the wall. That's a collision, game over. So UP is a bad choice.\n\nIf the direction is LEFT: moving left from (1,3) would take the head to (1,2). Let's check that position. The current row 1 is \"#  HA  #\", so column 2 is a space (since positions 0: #, 1:  , 2:  , 3:H, 4:A, etc. So (1,2) is empty (a space). So that's a valid move. Then, the body would follow. The current body is at (2,2). When the snake moves, the head moves to (1,2), and the old head (1,3) becomes part of the body, and the body (2,2) would move to where? The snake's body segments follow the head. So the length is 2. So the new positions would be: head at (1,2), body at (1,3). Because when moving, each body part moves to the position of the previous part. So the old head (1,3) becomes the new body, and the old body (2,2) would no longer be part of the snake if the length is 2. Wait, let's think again. The snake's length is 2. So the head is at (1,3), and the body is at (2,2). When moving, the head moves to new position (let's say (1,2) for LEFT). Then the body's new position is the old head's position (1,3). So the new snake positions are (1,2) [head] and (1,3) [body]. Then, check if the new head position (1,2) is a wall or body. (1,2) is a space, so safe. Also, the body is (1,3), which is not colliding with the head. So that's okay.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: moving right from (1,3) would take the head to (1,4). Let's check (1,4). The current row 1 is \"#  HA  #\", so (1,4) is 'A' (an apple). So moving RIGHT would make the head go to (1,4), which is an apple. So the snake eats the apple, score increases by 1 (now 2), and the snake grows by 1 (length becomes 3). Then, the new head is (1,4), the old head (1,3) becomes body, and the old body (2,2) becomes another body part. So the snake's positions would be (1,4) [H], (1,3) [S], (2,2) [S]. Let's check if that's valid. The new head (1,4) is not a wall (row 1 is within 0-7, column 4 is 0-7, so not a wall). Also, the new head is not colliding with any body parts. The body parts are (1,3) and (2,2), which are different from (1,4). So that's safe. Also, the apple at (1,4) is eaten, so that square becomes part of the snake, and a new apple would be generated? Wait, the problem statement says \"the game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board.\" So when an apple is eaten, is a new one generated? The example shows that after eating an apple, the next state has the apple replaced. For example, in the example, the initial board has A's, after moving down (eating an apple), the new board has the H in a new position, and the A's are in other positions. So I think when an apple is eaten, a new apple is placed (but the problem says \"the game starts with 3 apples\" and \"each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one\". So maybe there are always 3 apples on the board. So when one is eaten, a new one is added. But the problem statement isn't explicit. However, in the current board, let's check how many apples are present. Current board:\n\nRow 1 has 'A' at (1,4).\n\nRow 2 has 'A' at (2,4).\n\nRow 4 has 'A' at (4,3).\n\nSo that's 3 apples. So if the snake moves RIGHT to (1,4), which is an apple, then that apple is eaten. Then, a new apple would be placed (so the total remains 3). But for the immediate next step, the important thing is that moving RIGHT would result in eating an apple, which is good for the score, and the snake grows.\n\nSo moving RIGHT would be better because it allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nNow, possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since current direction is UP, can't go DOWN).\n\nUP: next position (0,3) is a wall. So collision, game over. So UP is invalid.\n\nLEFT: next position (1,2). That's empty. The snake moves there, body follows. No collision. But no apple eaten.\n\nRIGHT: next position (1,4). That's an apple. Eat it, score increases, snake grows. The new head is (1,4). Check if that's a valid position (not a wall, not body). The new head (1,4) is not a wall. The body after moving would be (1,3) (old head) and (2,2) (old body). So (1,4) is not colliding with body. So that's safe.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT, as it allows the snake to eat an apple without collision.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  HA  #\n#  S A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 1, column 3). The current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 0, column 3), which is a wall. This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 1, column 2), an empty space. The snake moves safely but does not eat an apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (row 1, column 4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. The new head position (row 1, column 4) is not a wall or body segment, so no collision occurs.  \n\nMoving RIGHT is the optimal choice as it allows the snake to eat an apple safely. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, let's start by understanding the current game board. The user said to repeat the current game board first. Let me parse that.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  SH  # → So positions (1,2) is ' ', (1,3) is 'S', (1,4) is 'H', others are '#' or ' '.\nRow 2: #  S A # → (2,2) 'S', (2,4) 'A'\nRow 3: #    A # → (3,4) 'A'\nRow 4: #   A  # → (4,3) 'A'\nRows 5 and 6: #      # (empty except walls)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right. The snake's head is at (1,4) because row 1 (index 1) has 'SH' at positions 3 and 4. So head (H) is at (row 1, column 4). The body (S) is at (1,3). Since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move would be to the right if we don't change direction. Let's check where the head would go if moving RIGHT now.\n\nCurrent head position is (1,4). Moving RIGHT would take it to (1,5). Let's check that cell. Looking at row 1: \"#  SH  #\". The columns are 0 (wall), 1 (space), 2 (space), 3 (S), 4 (H), 5 (space), 6 (space), 7 (wall). So (1,5) is a space. That's safe. But wait, the snake's body is (1,3), so (1,5) is not a body part, and not a wall, so moving RIGHT is possible. But maybe there's an apple nearby we can reach.\n\nWait, the snake's length is 2 right now (head at (1,4), body at (1,3)). Because the initial length is 1, but if it's already has a body (S), that means it has eaten an apple before. Because each apple increases length by 1. So starting length 1, after eating 1 apple, length 2. So current length is 2.\n\nNow, current direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction. So if current direction is RIGHT, the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT. Because reversing would be LEFT, which is not allowed.\n\nLet's list possible directions:\n\nPossible directions: RIGHT (current, allowed), UP (allowed), DOWN (allowed). LEFT is reverse, not allowed.\n\nWe need to check each possible direction to see if moving there is safe (no collision with walls or self) and if it can eat an apple.\n\nFirst, check moving RIGHT (current direction). Next head position: (1,4) + RIGHT → (1,5). What's in (1,5)? From row 1: \"#  SH  #\", so column 5 is a space. So no collision. Then, the body would move. Since the snake's length is 2, the body (1,3) would move to where the head was, which is (1,4). So the new positions would be head (1,5), body (1,4). The old body (1,3) would be removed. So that's safe, but no apple eaten.\n\nNext, check moving UP. Current head is (1,4). Moving UP would take it to (0,4). But row 0 is all walls (########). So (0,4) is a wall. So moving UP would cause collision with wall. Game over. So UP is invalid.\n\nCheck moving DOWN. Current head (1,4) moving DOWN would go to (2,4). Let's check row 2: \"#  S A #\". Columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: S, 3: space, 4: A, 5: space, 6: #. So (2,4) is 'A' (an apple). So moving DOWN would take the head to (2,4), which is an apple. That's good. Then, the snake eats the apple, grows in length. So the new head is (2,4). The body would now include the previous head (1,4) as a new body part. Since the length was 2 (H at (1,4), S at (1,3)), after eating the apple, length becomes 3. So the new body parts would be (1,4) and (1,3). Let's confirm: when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So if the snake was moving RIGHT (current direction), but we change direction to DOWN, the movement is:\n\nOriginal positions: H at (1,4), S at (1,3).\n\nIf direction is DOWN, the head moves to (2,4). The body (1,3) moves to (1,4) (since the previous head was there). So the new body positions are (1,4) (new S) and (1,3) (old S). So the snake's body would be (1,3) → (1,4) → (2,4) (head). So the new board would have H at (2,4), S at (1,4) and (1,3). And the apple at (2,4) is eaten, so that cell becomes H, and a new apple would be generated (but the problem says there are 3 apples initially, but after eating one, maybe another is added? The example shows that after eating, the apple is gone. The example given: original has 3 apples, after moving down, one is eaten, and the new board shows two apples left. So the problem says \"the game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board.\" So when an apple is eaten, the count decreases by one, but perhaps a new one is added? The example shows that after eating, the apple is removed. Let's check the example:\n\nOriginal example board:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAfter moving DOWN, the new board is:\n\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nOriginal apples: 3 (positions (1,5), (4,1), (4,2)). After moving down, the head moves from (3,1) (row 3, column 1) to (4,1) (row 4, column 1), which was an apple. So the new head is at (4,1) (H), and the old head (3,1) becomes S. The apple at (4,1) is eaten, so the new apples are (1,5), (4,2). So the example shows that when an apple is eaten, it's removed (so 3 apples → 2). So in our current problem, the current board has 3 apples. Let's count:\n\nRow 1: no apples. Row 2: (2,4) is A. Row 3: (3,4) is A. Row 4: (4,3) is A. So 3 apples. So if we move DOWN to (2,4), which is an apple, then that apple is eaten. The score increases by 1, and the snake's length increases by 1 (from 2 to 3). So moving DOWN is safe (no collision with self or walls) and gets an apple. That's better than moving RIGHT which gives no apple.\n\nWhat about moving LEFT? Oh, the current direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction, so moving LEFT (opposite of RIGHT) is not allowed. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN. UP is invalid (wall), LEFT is invalid (reverse). So the options are RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nMoving DOWN leads to eating an apple. That's better. So the best direction is DOWN.\n\n\n########\n#  SH  #\n#  S A #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The head (H) is at (row 1, column 4). The body (S) is at (row 1, column 3). The snake’s current length is 2 (since it has one body segment).  \n2. **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).  \n3. **Possible Directions**: RIGHT, UP, DOWN (LEFT is reversed and invalid).  \n4. **Collision Checks**:  \n   - **UP**: Moving UP from (1,4) leads to (0,4), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). Collision → Game over.  \n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (1,4) leads to (1,5), which is empty (no wall or body). Safe but no apple.  \n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,4) leads to (2,4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake to length 3. No collision (no wall or self).  \n\nMoving DOWN is safe, allows the snake to eat an apple, and maximizes score. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, let's start by understanding the current game board. Let's repeat it as required.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#  SS  #\n#   HA #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, and the current epoch is 6. The snake is moving down right now. Let's recall the rules: the snake can't reverse direction. Since the current direction is DOWN, the snake can't immediately go UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since that's allowed). \n\nFirst, let's find the head's position. The head is 'H'. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  SS  # → positions (1,2) and (1,3) are 'S' (body)\nRow 2: #   HA # → Let's index rows from 0 to 7 (since it's 8x8). So row 2 is the third row. Let's check each column (columns 0-7, with 0 being leftmost, 7 rightmost). The row 2 is \"#   HA #\". Let's break it down:\n- column 0: '#'\n- column 1: ' '\n- column 2: ' '\n- column 3: ' '\n- column 4: 'H' (head)\n- column 5: 'A' (apple)\n- column 6: ' '\n- column 7: '#'\nSo head is at (2,4) (row 2, column 4).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, so the next position if moving DOWN would be row 3, column 4. Let's check row 3: #    A #. So row 3, column 4: let's see. Row 3 is \"#    A #\". Columns 0-7:\n0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nSo (3,4) is a space. So moving DOWN would take the head to (3,4). What's there? It's empty. So the snake would move there, and since it's not an apple, the body would follow. The body's current positions are (1,2) and (1,3). The head was at (2,4), moving to (3,4). The body would shift: the previous head (2,4) becomes part of the body, so the new body would be (1,2), (1,3), (2,4). The head is (3,4).\n\nBut wait, maybe there's an apple in that direction. Let's check the next positions. Let's also check the possible directions. The snake can't go UP (reverse of current direction DOWN). So possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. DOWN: Next head position is (3,4). What's at (3,4)? From row 3: \"#    A #\", so column 4 is ' ', so no apple. So the snake moves there. No apple eaten, body shifts. Safe? Let's check if (3,4) is a wall or body. The walls are around the edges (rows 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7). (3,4) is inside, so not a wall. The body is at (1,2), (1,3), (2,4) (after moving). So (3,4) is not a body part. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\n2. LEFT: Direction LEFT. The current direction is DOWN, so turning LEFT is allowed (not reverse). The head is at (2,4). Moving LEFT would take it to (2,3). Let's check (2,3). The row 2 is \"#   HA #\", column 3 is ' ' (since column 4 is H, column 3 is before that). So (2,3) is ' ' (empty). But wait, the body is at (1,2) and (1,3). So (2,3) is not part of the body. So moving LEFT to (2,3) is safe. Any apple there? No, (2,3) is ' '.\n\n3. RIGHT: Direction RIGHT. Head at (2,4), moving RIGHT to (2,5). What's (2,5)? Row 2 has \"#   HA #\", column 5 is 'A' (apple). Oh! That's an apple. So if the snake moves RIGHT, the head would go to (2,5), which is an apple. Then, the snake eats the apple, grows by one, score increases. The new head is (2,5), and the body would include the previous head (2,4) and the existing body (1,2), (1,3). So the new body would be (1,2), (1,3), (2,4), and head (2,5). Since the apple is eaten, that position becomes part of the snake, and a new apple would be placed? Wait, the problem statement says \"the next state of the board will be\" example shows that after eating, the apple is replaced by the snake. So in the example, when moving down, the head moves to where the apple was, and the apple is removed, and the body grows. So in the current scenario, moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,5), which is an apple. So that's a good move because it allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score. \n\nIs moving RIGHT allowed? The current direction is DOWN. Turning RIGHT is allowed (since you can't reverse direction, which would be UP here). So direction change from DOWN to RIGHT is allowed. \n\nLet's confirm the head's position and movement. The current head is at (2,4). Current direction is DOWN. If we choose RIGHT, the new direction is RIGHT, so the head moves to (2,4) + RIGHT (column +1) → (2,5). Which is an apple. So that's a valid move, and safe. No collision with walls (since (2,5) is column 5, which is within 1-6, so not a wall). And the body is at (1,2), (1,3). (2,5) is not part of the body, so no self-collision. So moving RIGHT would result in eating the apple. That's better than moving DOWN or LEFT, which don't eat an apple. \n\nSo the best move is to turn RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SS  #\n#   HA #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and game rules:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 2, column 4).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN (snake cannot reverse to UP).\n- **Apples**: There are apples at (row 2, column 5), (row 3, column 5), and (row 4, column 4).\n- **Body Positions**: The body 'S' is at (row 1, column 2) and (row 1, column 3).\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (row 3, column 4), which is empty (no apple). Safe but no score gain.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (row 2, column 3), which is empty (no apple). Safe but no score gain.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (row 2, column 5), which contains an apple ('A'). This would allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1. The move is safe (no collision with walls or self).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is the best choice as it allows the snake to eat an apple and gain a score point.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let me parse it row by row. The rows are:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #  SS  # (so positions (1,2) and (1,3) are 'S')\nRow 2: #   SH # (positions (2,3) is 'S', (2,4) is 'H' — head)\nRow 3: #    A # (position (3,4) is 'A')\nRow 4: #   A  # (position (4,3) is 'A')\nRow 5: # A    # (position (5,1) is 'A')\nRow 6: #      # (empty)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the epoch is 7 (so we're early in the game, not near the 100th yet). The snake's head is at (2,4) (since row 2 is the third row, assuming rows are 0-indexed). The body parts are at (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) — because in row 1, columns 2 and 3 are 'S', and row 2, column 3 is 'S'. So the snake's body is: let's list the coordinates. The head is H at (2,4). The body segments would be in the order of movement. Since the current direction is RIGHT, the previous direction was probably RIGHT, so the body is behind the head. Let's think about the snake's path. \n\nThe snake's movement direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction, so if current direction is RIGHT, the next direction can't be LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (but RIGHT is continuing the same direction). \n\nFirst, let's find the head's current position. Let's index rows from top to bottom (row 0 to 7) and columns from left to right (0 to 7). So each cell is (row, column).\n\nRow 2 is \"#   SH #\". Let's split that into characters. The first character is '#', then ' ', ' ', ' ', 'S', 'H', ' ', '#'. So columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: '#'. So the head (H) is at (2,4).\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So the next position the head would move to if direction remains RIGHT is (2,5). Let's check that cell. Row 2, column 5 is ' ' (from the row \"#   SH #\", which is column 5: ' '). So moving RIGHT would take H to (2,5), which is empty. But is there a body part there? Let's check the board. Row 2, column 5 is ' ', so no. The body parts are in row 1, columns 2 and 3 (so (1,2), (1,3)), and row 2, column 3 (so (2,3)). So (2,5) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (can't go LEFT). Let's check each possible direction's next head position.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since LEFT is the reverse direction, which is not allowed).\n\nIf direction is UP: the next head position is (2-1,4) = (1,4). Let's check row 1, which is \"#  SS  #\". The columns in row 1: 0:'#', 1:' ', 2:'S', 3:'S', 4:' ', 5:' ', 6:'#'. So (1,4) is ' ' (empty). So moving UP would take H to (1,4). Is that a body part? The body parts are (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). (1,4) is empty, so safe.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: next head position is (2+1,4) = (3,4). Let's check row 3: \"#    A #\". Columns: 0:'#', 1:' ', 2:' ', 3:' ', 4:'A', 5:' ', 6:'#'. So (3,4) is 'A' (an apple). Oh, that's an apple! So moving DOWN would make the snake eat the apple. That's good because it increases the score and the snake grows. Let's check if moving DOWN is allowed. The current direction is RIGHT; turning DOWN is allowed (since it's not the reverse direction, which would be LEFT). So direction can be changed to DOWN.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: next head position is (2,5), which is ' ', as checked earlier. No apple there. So moving RIGHT would not get an apple.\n\nSo the options are:\n\n- UP: moves to (1,4), safe, no apple.\n- DOWN: moves to (3,4), which has an apple. So eating it, score increases by 1, and the snake grows. That's better.\n- RIGHT: moves to (2,5), no apple.\n\nSo the best choice is to move DOWN, as that leads to eating an apple. Let's confirm the next position. Current head is (2,4). Moving DOWN (row+1) to (3,4), which is 'A'. So the snake will eat that apple, grow, and the new head is (3,4). The body will extend. The previous positions of the body will shift. Since the snake was moving RIGHT before, the body was (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), and the head (2,4). When moving DOWN, the new head is (3,4). The body segments would be (2,4) (old head), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,2). So the new body would have those positions. But in the next board, the old body parts (except the tail, if the snake grows) would remain. Since the snake ate an apple, it grows, so the tail doesn't disappear. So the body would now include all previous body parts plus the old head. So that's good.\n\nAlso, need to check for collisions. Moving DOWN to (3,4) is within the board (rows 0-7, columns 0-7). The walls are on the edges (row 0 and 7, columns 0 and 6). (3,4) is within the board, so no wall collision. The cell (3,4) is 'A', not a body part. So no self-collision. So moving DOWN is safe and gives an apple. That's the best move.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SS  #\n#   SH #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head ('H') is at (row 2, column 4), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). We evaluate the three valid directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):\n\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 1, column 4). This cell is empty (' '), so no collision occurs, but there is no apple here. This move does not increase the score.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 3, column 4). This cell contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length. The new head position (3,4) is within the board (no wall collision) and does not overlap with the snake's body (current body segments are at (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)), so no self-collision occurs. This is a safe and beneficial move.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 2, column 5). This cell is empty (' '), so no collision occurs, but there is no apple here. This move does not increase the score.\n\nAmong the options, moving DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple, which is the most advantageous action. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # ASS  # (so positions (1,1) is 'A', (1,2) 'S', (1,3) 'S', others are spaces)\nRow 2: #   SS # (positions (2,3) 'S', (2,4) 'S')\nRow 3: #    H # (position (3,4) is 'H' since after the spaces, the 'H' is there. Let's check: index starts at 0. So row 3 is \"#    H #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: '#', 7: '#'? Wait, no, each row is 8 characters. Let's parse each row correctly.\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7 are all '#')\nRow 1: # ASS  # → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'? Wait, wait, let's count. The string is \"# ASS  #\". Let's index each character:\n\nIndex 0: '#'\nIndex 1: ' '\nIndex 2: 'A'\nIndex 3: 'S'\nIndex 4: 'S'\nIndex 5: ' '\nIndex 6: ' '\nIndex 7: '#'\nSo row 1 is [0:'#', 1:' ', 2:'A', 3:'S', 4:'S', 5:' ', 6:' ', 7:'#']\n\nRow 2: #   SS # → \"#   SS #\". Let's index:\n0: '#', 1:' ', 2:' ', 3:' ', 4:'S', 5:'S', 6:' ', 7:'#'\n\nRow 3: #    H # → \"#    H #\". Indices:\n0: '#', 1:' ', 2:' ', 3:' ', 4:' ', 5:'H', 6:' ', 7:'#' → Wait, no. Let's check the characters. The string is \"#    H #\". Let's split: positions 0 is '#', then 1-4 are spaces (since \"    \" is four spaces), then position 5 is 'H', position 6 is ' ', position 7 is '#'. So row 3, column 5 is 'H'.\n\nRow 4: #   A  # → \"#   A  #\". Indices: 0:'#', 1:' ', 2:' ', 3:' ', 4:'A', 5:' ', 6:' ', 7:'#'\n\nRow 5: # A    # → \"# A    #\". Indices: 0:'#', 1:' ', 2:'A', 3:' ', 4:' ', 5:' ', 6:' ', 7:'#'\n\nRow 6: #      # → \"#      #\". All spaces between the '#'s.\n\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nNow, the snake's head is at row 3, column 5 (H's position). The current direction is DOWN. So the snake is moving down. Let's confirm the next position if it continues DOWN. The head is at (3,5), moving DOWN would take it to (4,5). Let's check row 4, column 5: row 4 is \"#   A  #\", which is column 5 is ' ' (since 0:'#', 1:' ', 2:' ', 3:' ', 4:'A', 5:' ', 6:' ', 7:'#'). So (4,5) is a space. So moving DOWN would take the head to (4,5), which is safe (not a wall, not a body part).\n\nBut we need to check possible directions. The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is DOWN. So the possible directions are UP (reverse, not allowed), LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. Wait, no. The rule says \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So, if current direction is DOWN, the reverse is UP. So the snake can't choose UP. So possible directions are DOWN (current), LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's list possible moves:\n\n1. Continue DOWN: next head position (4,5). Check if that's a wall or body. (4,5) is ' ' (from row 4: column 5 is ' '). So safe. Also, check if there's an apple there. (4,5) is ' ', so no apple. Then the snake moves: the body parts follow. The current snake's body: need to track the positions. Let's figure out the snake's body.\n\nThe snake starts with length 1 (head). Then each time it eats an apple, it grows. Let's track the body positions.\n\nCurrent head is 'H' at (3,5). The body is 'S's. Let's find all 'S's on the board.\n\nRow 1: columns 3 and 4 are 'S's → positions (1,3), (1,4)\nRow 2: columns 4 and 5 are 'S's → (2,4), (2,5)\nSo the snake's body is at (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5). The head is at (3,5). So the snake's length is 1 (head) + 4 (body) = 5. Which implies the snake has eaten 4 apples (since starting length 1, each apple adds 1, so 1 + 4 = 5).\n\nNow, the snake's movement: when moving, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So the body is a sequence. Let's reconstruct the snake's path. The direction was moving DOWN. Let's see how the body is arranged.\n\nThe head is at (3,5). The body segments are (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3). Because the snake moves in direction, the body follows. Let's check: if the snake was moving DOWN, the previous positions would be such that the next segment is the previous head position.\n\nFor example, if the head was at (2,5), moving DOWN to (3,5), then the body would have (2,5) as the next segment. Then if previous, the head was at (2,4), moving DOWN to (2,5), then (2,4) becomes a body part. So the body is ordered from head's previous positions.\n\nSo the snake's body segments in order (from head to tail) would be:\n\nHead: (3,5)\nBody1: (2,5) (the position the head was in before moving to (3,5))\nBody2: (2,4) (position before Body1)\nBody3: (1,4) (position before Body2)\nBody4: (1,3) (position before Body3)\n\nSo the snake's body is a sequence: (3,5) → (2,5) → (2,4) → (1,4) → (1,3). That makes sense given the positions of 'S's.\n\nNow, if the snake moves DOWN to (4,5), the new head is (4,5). The body segments will shift: Body1 becomes (3,5), Body2 becomes (2,5), Body3 becomes (2,4), Body4 becomes (1,4). The tail (1,3) would remain if the snake doesn't eat an apple. Wait, but when the snake doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward (i.e., the tail is removed, because the snake moves forward and doesn't grow). Because, in normal movement (without eating), the snake's length remains the same, so the head moves forward, and each body part follows, and the tail is removed. Only when eating an apple, the tail doesn't get removed (so the length increases by 1).\n\nSo, in this case, if the snake moves to (4,5) and doesn't eat an apple, the new body positions would be (3,5) (old head), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4). The tail (1,3) would be removed (since the snake length is 5, moving without eating, so the tail is removed to keep length 5). Wait, no. Let's clarify: the snake's length is 5 (head + 4 body segments). When moving, if it doesn't eat an apple, the length remains 5, so the head moves to new position, and the body segments shift, and the last segment (tail) is removed. So the new body would be the previous head, then Body1, Body2, Body3, and the new tail is Body4 (but wait, original body has 4 segments, so 1 head + 4 body = 5. After moving, new head is (4,5), body segments are (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4). So the tail is (1,4) now. The old tail (1,3) would become empty (since it's no longer part of the snake).\n\nBut in the game board, the 'S's are the body. So the new board after moving DOWN (without eating) would have 'H' at (4,5), 'S's at (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4). The (1,3) position would become a space.\n\nNow, possible directions to choose: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (since UP is reverse and not allowed).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\nOption 1: DOWN. Next head position (4,5). Check if (4,5) is safe. (4,5) is ' ' (from row 4: column 5 is ' '). So no collision. So this is a valid move.\n\nOption 2: LEFT. The direction would be LEFT. The snake's current direction is DOWN, so LEFT is allowed (not reverse). The head is at (3,5). Moving LEFT would take it to (3,4). Let's check (3,4). Row 3 is \"#    H #\", which is column 4: in row 3, the 'H' is at column 5, so column 4 is ' ' (since the row is \"#    H #\": positions 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'H', 6: ' ', 7: '#'). So (3,4) is ' '. Safe. Then, moving LEFT to (3,4). No apple there (since (3,4) is ' '). So the snake moves, and the body shifts.\n\nOption 3: RIGHT. Direction RIGHT. The head is at (3,5). Moving RIGHT would take it to (3,6). Check (3,6): row 3, column 6 is ' ' (since row 3 is \"#    H #\", column 6 is ' '). So (3,6) is ' ', safe. So that's a valid move.\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's check where the apples are.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1, column 2: 'A' (position (1,2))\nRow 4, column 4: 'A' (position (4,4))\nRow 5, column 2: 'A' (position (5,2))\n\nSo apples at (1,2), (4,4), (5,2).\n\nWe need to find a direction that leads the snake towards an apple, avoiding collision.\n\nCurrent head is at (3,5). Let's see the positions of apples:\n\n(1,2) is top-left area.\n\n(4,4) is in row 4, column 4.\n\n(5,2) is row 5, column 2.\n\nLet's check possible moves and their next positions:\n\nIf direction is DOWN: head moves to (4,5). Then, next step, the snake's direction could be adjusted. But let's see if (4,5) is near any apples. (4,5) is adjacent to (4,4) (left) which has an apple. So if the snake moves DOWN to (4,5), then next move could be LEFT to (4,4) to eat the apple.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: head moves to (3,4). Then, (3,4) is adjacent to (4,4) (down). So if the snake moves LEFT to (3,4), then next move could be DOWN to (4,4) (the apple's position).\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: head moves to (3,6). (3,6) is a space. Then, possible next moves would be towards other apples, but (3,6) is near the right wall (column 7 is a wall). So moving right may not be helpful.\n\nLet's evaluate the current possible moves for the best path to an apple.\n\nFirst, the apple at (4,4) is in row 4, column 4. Let's see the distance from the current head (3,5) to (4,4). That's one step down and one step left. If the snake moves DOWN to (4,5), then LEFT to (4,4) (the apple's position), that's two steps. Alternatively, if the snake moves LEFT to (3,4), then DOWN to (4,4) (the apple's position), that's two steps as well.\n\nBut let's check the next positions for each option.\n\nOption 1: Move DOWN to (4,5). Next possible directions (since current direction would then be DOWN, so can't reverse to UP). So possible directions would be DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFrom (4,5), moving LEFT would take to (4,4), which is the apple. That's a good move. So moving DOWN now allows the snake to reach the apple in the next step.\n\nOption 2: Move LEFT to (3,4). Then current direction is LEFT. Next possible directions (can't reverse to RIGHT). So directions LEFT, UP, DOWN. Moving DOWN from (3,4) would take to (4,4) (the apple). That's also possible.\n\nOption 3: Move RIGHT to (3,6). Then current direction is RIGHT. Next moves could be RIGHT (but column 7 is a wall, so (3,7) is a wall, can't move there). So moving RIGHT would lead towards the wall, which is dangerous.\n\nNow, check if any of the moves would cause collision. All three options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are currently safe. So which one is better?\n\nThe apple at (4,4) is the closest. Let's see which direction gets us there first.\n\nIf we choose DOWN, next head is (4,5). Then next move LEFT to (4,4) (apple). That would be eating the apple, increasing the score.\n\nIf we choose LEFT, next head is (3,4). Then next move DOWN to (4,4) (apple). Also eating the apple.\n\nSo both options can reach the apple in two steps. But we need to check if the path is clear.\n\nLet's check the path for moving DOWN first:\n\nCurrent head (3,5) → DOWN to (4,5). The body would shift. The new body positions would be (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4). The tail (1,3) is now a space.\n\nThen, from (4,5), moving LEFT to (4,4). (4,4) is the apple. So the snake would eat it, grow, and the new head is (4,4). The body would be (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4). The length increases by 1, so the tail (1,4) remains (since the snake grows, so the tail isn't removed). So that's safe.\n\nFor moving LEFT first:\n\nCurrent head (3,5) → LEFT to (3,4). Body positions would be (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4). Tail (1,3) is space.\n\nThen, from (3,4), moving DOWN to (4,4). (4,4) is the apple. So snake eats it, head moves there, body becomes (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4). That's also safe.\n\nSo both paths are possible. But which direction is better now? Let's see if there are any other apples that are closer.\n\nThe other apples are at (1,2) and (5,2). (5,2) is in row 5, column 2. The current head is at (3,5). The distance to (5,2) is 2 rows down and 3 columns left. That's further.\n\n(1,2) is 2 rows up and 3 columns left. Also further.\n\nSo the closest apple is (4,4).\n\nNow, check if moving DOWN now would block any path. Let's see the body positions.\n\nIf we move DOWN, the new head is (4,5). The body is (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4). Are there any collisions possible in the next step? For example, moving LEFT to (4,4) (apple) is safe, as (4,4) is not part of the body.\n\nIf we move LEFT, the new head is (3,4). The body is (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4). Then moving DOWN to (4,4) (apple) is also safe.\n\nSo both options are safe. Which one to choose?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better direction. Let's check the current body positions. The snake's body is at (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5) (head). So the body is in the upper middle area.\n\nIf we move DOWN, the snake is moving towards row 4, which is where the apple (4,4) is. That's a good direction.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT would take the head to (3,4), which is adjacent to (4,4) (down). So that's also good.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the current direction is DOWN. If we continue moving DOWN, the next position is (4,5). Let's check (4,5) in the current board. The row 4 is \"#   A  #\", which is (4,4) is 'A', (4,5) is ' '.\n\nYes, (4,5) is safe.\n\nSo, the best move here is to continue moving DOWN, as it's the current direction and leads towards the apple in the next step. Alternatively, moving LEFT could also work, but perhaps moving DOWN is better as it's the current direction and avoids any possible confusion.\n\nWait, but let's make sure that moving DOWN doesn't lead to a wall. The board's bottom wall is row 7. Current head is row 3. Moving DOWN to row 4, 5, 6 are safe (rows 4,5,6 are within 0-7, walls are 0 and 7). So row 4 is safe.\n\nThus, the best direction is DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# ASS  #\n#   SS #\n#    H #\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3,5) (row 3, column 5) and is currently moving DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid), leaving possible directions: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n- **DOWN**: The head moves to (4,5). This position is empty (no wall or body collision). From (4,5), the next move LEFT would reach the apple at (4,4), allowing the snake to eat it in the following step.  \n- **LEFT**: The head moves to (3,4). This position is empty. From (3,4), the next move DOWN would reach the apple at (4,4), also a valid path to the apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: The head moves to (3,6). This position is empty, but (3,6) is near the right wall (column 7 is a wall), and there are no nearby apples, making this direction less optimal.  \n\n### Best Choice:\nThe closest apple is at (4,4). Moving DOWN keeps the snake aligned with the current direction and positions it to reach the apple in the next step (by moving LEFT from (4,5) to (4,4)). This path avoids walls and body collisions.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # A S  # (so positions (1,1) is 'A', (1,2) is 'S', others are empty)\nRow 2: #   SS # (positions (2,3) and (2,4) are 'S')\nRow 3: #    S # (position (3,4) is 'S')\nRow 4: #   AH # (positions (4,3) is 'A', (4,4) is 'H' (head))\nRow 5: # A    # (position (5,1) is 'A')\nRow 6: #      # (empty)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. The snake's head is at (4,4) (row 4, column 4). Let's confirm the snake's body positions. The body is 'S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1, column 2: (1,2)\nRow 2, columns 3 and 4: (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3, column 4: (3,4)\nSo the snake's body is from (1,2) to (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), and the head is at (4,4). Let's track the snake's path. Since the current direction is DOWN, the head was moving down. Let's see the previous positions. When the snake moves, the head moves in the direction, and the body follows. Since the snake's length is the number of S's plus 1 (head). Let's count S's: row1 has 1, row2 has 2, row3 has 1. Total S's: 1+2+1=4. So the snake length is 5 (head + 4 body segments). So the body segments are in order: the head is (4,4), then the next segment (the one that was head before moving down) would be (3,4) (since moving down from (3,4) to (4,4) would make (3,4) the new body). Then before that, the head was at (2,4), moving down to (3,4), so (2,4) is another body segment. Then (2,3), (1,2) as earlier segments. So the body is (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,2).\n\nNow, the snake is currently moving DOWN. The next move direction can't be reversed. Since current direction is DOWN, the opposite is UP. So the snake can't turn UP. Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since the player can choose to keep direction, I think, as long as it's not reversing).\n\nThe head is at (4,4). Let's see where each direction would take the head next:\n\n- Current direction is DOWN. So if we choose DOWN again, the next head position is (5,4). Let's check if that's a valid position.\n\nRow 5 is \"# A    #\", so columns 0 is '#', 1 is 'A', 2-5 are empty (since row 5 is \"# A    #\", which is 8 characters. Let's index columns 0-7. So row 5, column 0: '#', column 1: 'A', columns 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (5,4) is empty (a space). So moving DOWN to (5,4) would be okay. No collision with body or walls.\n\n- If direction is LEFT: head moves to (4,3). Let's check (4,3). The current row 4 is \"#   AH #\". Columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (4,3) is 'A' (an apple). So moving LEFT would take the head to (4,3), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple increases the score and the snake grows. But we need to check if (4,3) is part of the snake's body. The body segments are (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,2). (4,3) is not in those positions, so no collision. So moving LEFT would eat the apple. Then the snake's length increases by 1. The new head is (4,3), and the body would include the previous head (4,4) as a new S, and the rest of the body follows.\n\n- Direction RIGHT: head moves to (4,5). Check (4,5). Row 4, column 5 is ' ' (empty). Is (4,5) part of the body? The body is (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,2). No. So moving RIGHT is possible. No collision.\n\n- Direction UP: current direction is DOWN, so reversing direction (UP) is not allowed. So UP is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. Now, which is best? Let's check the apples. The current apples are:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1, column 1: (1,1) 'A'\n\nRow 4, column 3: (4,3) 'A' (the one at (4,3) is where LEFT would take us)\n\nRow 5, column 1: (5,1) 'A'\n\nSo there are 3 apples. If we move LEFT, we eat the apple at (4,3), which is immediately beneficial. That's a good move. Let's check if moving LEFT is possible. The head is at (4,4). Moving LEFT (column 4-1=3) to (4,3) which is 'A'. So yes. After eating, the snake's length increases. The next head would be (4,3), and the previous head (4,4) becomes a body segment. Then the rest of the body follows. The new body would be (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,2). So the snake's body is safe.\n\nWhat about other directions? If we move DOWN to (5,4), that's empty. No apple. Then the next move would have to find apples. The apple at (5,1) is in row 5, column 1. So the snake is at (5,4), direction could be LEFT to go towards (5,1), but that's a possible path. But eating the apple now (LEFT) is better because it's immediate.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (4,5), that's empty. Then next move, perhaps direction DOWN again to (5,5), but no apple there. So not as good as eating the apple now.\n\nSo the best move is LEFT, which allows the snake to eat the apple immediately, increasing the score and length. No collision issues.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A S  #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#   AH #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at (4,4) (row 4, column 4). The snake's body segments are at (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), and (1,2). The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid). \n\nPossible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left takes the head to (4,3), which is an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or body) and will increase the score by 1.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right takes the head to (4,5), an empty space (no apple).  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down takes the head to (5,4), an empty space (no apple).  \n\nEating the apple immediately (LEFT) is optimal to maximize the score. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided. \n\nThe board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # A S  # → So positions (1,1) is 'A' (apple), (1,2) is 'S' (body)\nRow 2: #   SS # → (2,3) 'S', (2,4) 'S'\nRow 3: #    S # → (3,4) 'S'\nRow 4: #   HS # → (4,3) 'H' (head), (4,4) 'S' (body)\nRow 5: # A    # → (5,1) 'A'\nRow 6: #   A  # → (6,3) 'A'\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. Let's find the head position. The head 'H' is at (4,3) (row 4, column 3, assuming rows are 0-7 and columns 0-7). \n\nWhen the snake moves in the current direction (LEFT), the next position of the head would be (4, 3-1) = (4,2). Let's check what's there. Looking at row 4: #   HS #. The characters are [ '#', ' ', ' ', 'H', 'S', ' ', '#', '#' ]? Wait, maybe I should index each cell properly. Let's list each cell's coordinates (row, column) from 0,0 (top-left) to 7,7 (bottom-right).\n\nRow 0: columns 0-7 are all '#'\nRow 1: columns 0='#', 1='A', 2='S', 3=' ', 4=' ', 5='#', 6='#', 7='#'? Wait, maybe each row is 8 characters. Let's check the given board again. The user provided:\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n# A S  #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#   HS #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nEach row is 8 characters. Let's list each row's columns (0-7):\n\nRow 0: 0: '#', 1:'#', 2:'#', 3:'#', 4:'#', 5:'#', 6:'#', 7:'#'\nRow 1: 0:'#', 1:'A', 2:'S', 3:' ', 4:' ', 5:' ', 6:'#', 7:'#'? Wait, no, the user's input for row 1 is \"# A S  #\", which is 8 characters. Let's count: \"#\", \" \", \"A\", \" \", \"S\", \" \", \" \", \"#\" → that's 8? Let's check:\n\nRow 1: \"# A S  #\" → breaking it down:\nIndices 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'? Wait, no. Let's count the characters. The string \"# A S  #\" has 8 characters. Let's see:\n\nCharacter positions (0-based) for each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (8 '#')\nRow 1: # A S  # → characters: [0]'#', [1]' ', [2]'A', [3]' ', [4]'S', [5]' ', [6]' ', [7]'#'\nRow 2: #   SS # → [0]'#', [1]' ', [2]' ', [3]' ', [4]'S', [5]'S', [6]' ', [7]'#'\nRow 3: #    S # → [0]'#', [1]' ', [2]' ', [3]' ', [4]'S', [5]' ', [6]' ', [7]'#'\nRow 4: #   HS # → [0]'#', [1]' ', [2]' ', [3]'H', [4]'S', [5]' ', [6]' ', [7]'#'\nRow 5: # A    # → [0]'#', [1]' ', [2]'A', [3]' ', [4]' ', [5]' ', [6]' ', [7]'#'\nRow 6: #   A  # → [0]'#', [1]' ', [2]' ', [3]'A', [4]' ', [5]' ', [6]' ', [7]'#'\nRow 7: ######## (8 '#')\n\nSo the head 'H' is at (row 4, column 3). Current direction is LEFT. Moving LEFT means the head would move to (4, 2) (since left is column-1). Let's check (4,2): row 4, column 2 is ' ' (space). So that's empty. But wait, what's the snake's body? The body is 'S's. Let's list all the 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1, column 4: 'S' → (1,4)\nRow 2, column 4: 'S' → (2,4)\nRow 2, column 5: 'S' → (2,5)\nRow 3, column 4: 'S' → (3,4)\nRow 4, column 4: 'S' → (4,4)\n\nSo the snake's body is at (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (4,4). The head is at (4,3). The snake's length is 1 (head) plus 5 'S's → total length 6? Because the snake starts with length 1 (head), and each 'S' is part of the body. So current length is 6.\n\nNow, when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body part follows the previous part's position. But since the direction is LEFT, the next head position is (4,2). Let's check if that's a wall or body. (4,2) is a space, so no collision. So moving LEFT would be possible. But maybe there's a better direction. Let's check possible directions. The current direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing would be RIGHT, which is opposite of LEFT, so can't turn RIGHT). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible direction:\n\n1. Continue moving LEFT (current direction). New head position: (4,2). What's there? It's a space (from row 4, column 2). So no collision. The snake moves here. Then, the body parts would shift. The previous head (4,3) becomes 'S', and the rest of the body follows. So the new body positions would be (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (1,4). So the snake is safe here. But is there an apple here? (4,2) is a space, so no apple. So no score increase.\n\n2. Turn UP. The current direction is LEFT. Turning UP is allowed (since UP is not the reverse direction; reverse of LEFT is RIGHT). So moving UP would change direction to UP. The head's current position is (4,3). Moving UP would take it to (3,3). Let's check (3,3). Row 3: #    S # → columns 0-7. So row 3, column 3 is ' ' (since row 3 is [ '#', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'S', ' ', ' ', '#' ]). So (3,3) is a space. No collision. Any apple there? Let's check the apples. Apples are at (1,2), (5,2), (6,3). (3,3) is not an apple. So moving UP would be safe, but no apple eaten.\n\n3. Turn DOWN. Current direction is LEFT. Turning DOWN is allowed. Moving DOWN from (4,3) would take the head to (5,3). Let's check (5,3). Row 5: # A    # → [ '#', ' ', 'A', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '#' ] → column 3 is ' ' (since row 5, column 3 is index 3, which is ' '). So (5,3) is a space. No collision. Any apple there? (5,3) is not an apple. The apples are at (1,2) (row 1, column 2), (5,2) (row 5, column 2), (6,3) (row 6, column 3). So (5,3) is safe, no apple.\n\nWait, but let's check all possible directions again. Are there any apples in the possible next positions?\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT to (4,2), that's a space. UP to (3,3), space. DOWN to (5,3), space. What about if the snake turns LEFT (current direction), then next move, but perhaps there's a better path towards apples.\n\nLet's list all apple positions:\n\n- (1,2) → row 1, column 2 (A)\n- (5,2) → row 5, column 2 (A)\n- (6,3) → row 6, column 3 (A)\n\nThe head is at (4,3). Let's see the distance to each apple.\n\nApple at (6,3): row 6, column 3. The head is at (4,3). To reach this apple, the snake would need to move DOWN twice (from (4,3) → (5,3) → (6,3)). (6,3) is an apple. So if the snake moves DOWN, then next direction could be DOWN again (if possible), and reach (5,3), then (6,3) which is an apple.\n\nApple at (5,2): row 5, column 2. Head is at (4,3). To reach (5,2), the snake would need to move DOWN (to (5,3)) then LEFT (to (5,2)). (5,2) is an apple. So if the snake moves DOWN first, then LEFT, it can reach that apple.\n\nApple at (1,2): row 1, column 2. Head is at (4,3). To reach (1,2), the snake would need to move UP three times (4→3→2→1 in row) and LEFT once (3→2 in column). But the path may have body parts. Let's check if there's a body in the way.\n\nCurrent body positions are (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (4,4). So moving up from (4,3) to (3,3): that's safe. Then (2,3), (1,3). Are those positions occupied by body? Let's check (2,3): row 2 is #   SS # → column 3 is ' ', so (2,3) is empty. (1,3): row 1 is # A S  # → column 3 is ' ', so (1,3) is empty. So the path to (1,2) (row 1, column 2) would be (4,3) → (3,3) → (2,3) → (1,3) → (1,2). That's possible. But that's a longer path.\n\nThe closest apple is (6,3). Let's see:\n\nCurrent head (4,3). Moving DOWN to (5,3) (safe, as (5,3) is empty). Then moving DOWN again (direction DOWN) to (6,3), which is the apple. So if the snake moves DOWN now (changing direction from LEFT to DOWN), then next move (epoch 11) would be (5,3), then epoch 12, moving DOWN to (6,3), which is the apple. That's two moves to reach the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake continues moving LEFT (current direction) to (4,2). Then next direction could be DOWN (since current direction would be LEFT, then can turn DOWN). Then from (4,2) move DOWN to (5,2), which is the apple at (5,2). Oh! (5,2) is an apple. Let's check (5,2). Row 5, column 2: yes, (5,2) is 'A' (from row 5: # A    # → column 2 is 'A'). So (5,2) is an apple. So if the snake moves LEFT to (4,2), then direction can be DOWN (since current direction is LEFT, next direction can be DOWN, which is allowed). Then moving DOWN from (4,2) to (5,2) would reach the apple. That's two moves as well.\n\nSo let's think: moving LEFT first to (4,2) (epoch 10's move), then next direction DOWN to (5,2) (epoch 11's move), which is an apple. So that's a good path.\n\nBut wait, when the snake moves LEFT (epoch 10), the new head is (4,2). Then, the body shifts. The previous head (4,3) becomes 'S', and the rest of the body follows. So the body would now be (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (1,4). So (4,2) is the new head, and (4,3) is now body. So in epoch 11, if the direction is DOWN, the head moves to (5,2). Let's check (5,2): that's 'A', so eating it. Then the snake grows, so the body would include (4,2) (previous head) as part of the body, and the new head is (5,2). That's a good move.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake turns DOWN now (epoch 10's direction), moving to (5,3). Then in epoch 11, direction could be LEFT (since current direction is DOWN, next direction can be LEFT, which is allowed). Then from (5,3) move LEFT to (5,2) (the apple). That's also two moves. So either path could reach the apple in two steps.\n\nBut what about the current possible directions. The question is, what direction should the snake choose now (epoch 10) to maximize the chance of eating an apple without collision.\n\nLet's check for each possible direction (LEFT, UP, DOWN) whether moving in that direction would cause a collision.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. Possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN (can't go RIGHT).\n\n1. LEFT: new head (4,2). Check if (4,2) is a wall or body. (4,2) is row 4, column 2: from row 4 \"#   HS #\", column 2 is ' ' (since columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'). So (4,2) is empty. No collision. Safe.\n\n2. UP: new head (3,3). Check (3,3): row 3 is \"#    S #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (3,3) is ' ', safe.\n\n3. DOWN: new head (5,3). Check (5,3): row 5 is \"# A    #\", columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (5,3) is ' ', safe.\n\nAll three directions are safe. Now, which direction leads towards an apple?\n\nThe apples are at (1,2), (5,2), (6,3). Let's see the positions:\n\n- (5,2) is in row 5, column 2. To get there from (4,3), moving LEFT to (4,2) (column 2), then DOWN to (5,2). So that's a direct path.\n\n- (6,3) is in row 6, column 3. To get there from (4,3), moving DOWN to (5,3), then DOWN to (6,3). That's also a direct path.\n\nSo, if the snake moves LEFT now, it's moving towards column 2, which is where (5,2) is. If it moves DOWN, it's moving towards row 5, 6, where (5,3) and (6,3) are.\n\nWhich is better? Let's check if there's any body in the path for these directions.\n\nIf moving LEFT to (4,2), then next direction DOWN to (5,2). (5,2) is an apple, so that's good. The path from (4,2) to (5,2) is down, which is allowed (current direction would be LEFT, then can turn DOWN).\n\nIf moving DOWN to (5,3), then next direction LEFT to (5,2) (apple). (5,2) is an apple, so that's also good.\n\nBut let's see if there's any immediate apple in the next move. For example, if moving in a direction that would reach an apple in the current move. But none of the possible next positions (LEFT: (4,2); UP: (3,3); DOWN: (5,3)) have apples. So the snake needs to plan two moves ahead.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's body positions. Let's check if any of the possible next moves could lead to a collision in the next steps.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves UP to (3,3), then where would that lead. (3,3) is empty, but the next moves would depend on direction. But perhaps that's not the best path since the apples are in other areas.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN, which is better? Let's think.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT (current direction), then next direction can be DOWN. That would take it to (5,2), an apple. That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now, then LEFT to (5,2) (apple). Either way, the snake can reach (5,2) in two moves.\n\nBut let's check the body positions again. The current body is (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (4,4). So the snake's body is along column 4 in rows 1-4, and row 2, column 5. So the area around column 4 is occupied by the body. So moving towards column 2 (LEFT) would keep the snake away from its own body, which is a good thing.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (5,3), then the next move LEFT to (5,2) (apple) is safe, as (5,2) is an apple and (5,3) is empty.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT is better because (4,2) is empty, and then moving down to (5,2) (apple) is a direct path. Let's confirm the positions again.\n\nHead is at (4,3). Moving LEFT (current direction) → (4,2). Then, direction DOWN → (5,2). (5,2) is 'A' (apple). So that's a valid path. So moving LEFT now would allow the snake to reach an apple in the next move.\n\nSo the best direction here is LEFT. Wait, but the current direction is already LEFT, so moving LEFT is allowed (since you can continue in the same direction). So the snake can just keep moving LEFT, then turn DOWN to get the apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snake can turn DOWN now, but that's also allowed.\n\nBut the question is, which direction should be chosen now (epoch 10) to maximize the score. Since all directions are safe, but moving LEFT allows the snake to get closer to (5,2) apple, which is in column 2, same as moving LEFT. So I think moving LEFT is the best option here.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# A S  #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#   HS #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at (row 4, column 3), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Possible directions to consider are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n1. **LEFT (current direction)**: The head moves to (4, 2), which is empty (no wall or body collision). This positions the snake closer to the apple at (5, 2) (row 5, column 2). From (4, 2), the snake can later move DOWN to reach the apple.  \n2. **UP**: The head moves to (3, 3), which is empty. However, this direction does not directly approach any apple and moves away from the nearest apples.  \n3. **DOWN**: The head moves to (5, 3), which is empty. While this direction is safe, it does not immediately position the snake closer to an apple compared to moving LEFT.  \n\nMoving LEFT keeps the snake on a path toward the apple at (5, 2) and avoids collision. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#  HSS #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, and the current epoch is 11. The snake can't reverse direction, so since it's moving LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (but moving LEFT again would continue in the same direction). \n\nFirst, I need to find the snake's head position. The head is 'H'. Looking at the board, the 5th row (since rows are 0-indexed or 1-indexed? Let's check. The first line is row 0, then row 1, etc. Let's list them:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # A    # → positions (1,1) is A, others are spaces except walls at (1,0) and (1,7)\nRow 2: #   SS # → positions (2,3) S, (2,4) S\nRow 3: #    S # → position (3,4) S\nRow 4: #  HSS # → positions (4,2) H, (4,3) S, (4,4) S\nRow 5: # A    # → position (5,1) A\nRow 6: #   A  # → position (6,3) A\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at row 4, column 2 (assuming rows start at 0, columns 0-7). Let's confirm: row 4 is \"#  HSS #\". The characters are: index 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is 'H', 3 is 'S', 4 is 'S', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So yes, (4,2) is H.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So if the snake continues moving LEFT, the next head position would be (4,1). Let's check that cell. Row 4, column 1: in row 4, it's ' ' (since the row is \"#  HSS #\", positions 0 is #, 1 is ' ', 2 is H, 3 is S, etc. So (4,1) is ' '.\n\nBut what's around the head? Let's think about possible moves. The snake can't reverse direction, so can't go RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Continue LEFT (current direction):\nNext head position: (4,1). What's there? Let's check row 4, column 1. The current row 4 is \"#  HSS #\", so column 1 is ' '. So that's a valid move (not a wall, not a body part). Then, after moving LEFT, the head moves to (4,1), and the body follows. Since the snake's length is... let's count the body segments. The snake's body is S's. Let's list all S and H positions:\n\nH is at (4,2). Then S's are:\n\nRow 2: (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: (3,4)\nRow 4: (4,3), (4,4)\nSo total S's: 5 (positions (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4)) plus H is 1, so total length is 6. So when moving, the tail (the last S) will move only if the snake doesn't eat an apple. Since (4,1) is a space, not an apple, the snake's length remains the same, so the tail (the last S) will be removed. Let's see where the tail is. The snake's body is a sequence. Since the snake is moving LEFT, the head is (4,2), and the body is behind. The body segments are (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3). So the tail is (2,3). So when moving LEFT, the new head is (4,1), then the body becomes (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4). The tail (2,3) is removed. So the new position after moving LEFT would be (4,1) as H, followed by S's in (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4). The cell (2,3) becomes empty.\n\nBut is there any apple in (4,1)? Let's check the current board. The apples are in row 1 (1,1), row 5 (5,1), row 6 (6,3). So (4,1) is not an apple. So no apple eaten here. That's a safe move but no score gain.\n\n2. Direction UP: Moving UP from (4,2) would take the head to (3,2). Let's check (3,2). The current row 3 is \"#    S #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (3,2) is ' ' (empty). So that's a valid move. No collision with walls (since row 3 is within 0-7) and no collision with body. The body parts are at (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4). (3,2) is not among these. So moving UP is possible. Check if (3,2) is an apple: no, apples are at (1,1), (5,1), (6,3). So moving UP here is safe but no apple.\n\n3. Direction DOWN: Moving DOWN from (4,2) would take the head to (5,2). Let's check (5,2). The current row 5 is \"# A    #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (5,2) is ' ' (empty). No collision. But (5,2) is not an apple. The apple in row 5 is at (5,1). So moving DOWN to (5,2) is safe but no apple.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if any of these directions lead to apples. Let's see where the apples are: (1,1), (5,1), (6,3).\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,2). Let's see the positions of the apples:\n\n- (1,1): row 1, column 1. That's up and to the left from the head.\n- (5,1): row 5, column 1. That's down and to the left from the head (current position is row 4, column 2; 5 is down, 1 is left of 2).\n- (6,3): row 6, column 3. That's down and to the right from the head (row 4 to 6 is down 2, column 2 to 3 is right 1).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, so moving LEFT (to (4,1)) is possible. Let's check (4,1). What's in (4,1)? As before, it's empty, but (5,1) is an apple (row 5, column 1). If the snake is moving LEFT, then after moving to (4,1), next step (epoch 12) if it continues LEFT, it would go to (4,0), which is a wall (since column 0 is a wall). Oh, right! Because the board's edges are walls. So (4,0) is a wall. So if the snake moves LEFT to (4,1) in epoch 11, then in epoch 12, if direction is LEFT again, it would hit the wall (column 0). So that's a problem. So moving LEFT now might lead to a wall collision next step.\n\nAlternatively, after moving LEFT to (4,1), maybe the snake can turn UP or DOWN. Let's see. Let's think about the possible next moves.\n\nBut perhaps there's a closer apple. Let's see, (5,1) is an apple. The head is at (4,2). To reach (5,1), the snake would need to move DOWN (from (4,2) to (5,2)), then LEFT (to (5,1)), which is an apple. Let's check that path.\n\nIf current direction is LEFT, the snake can't reverse to RIGHT, but can turn UP or DOWN. So, if the snake turns DOWN now (epoch 11), moving to (5,2). Then, in the next epoch (12), the direction could be LEFT (since current direction would be DOWN, so next direction can't be UP, but can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN). If direction is LEFT in epoch 12, the head moves from (5,2) to (5,1), which is the apple. That would be good. So that's a possible path.\n\nLet's check (5,1): it's an apple. So if the snake can reach (5,1) in the next move, that's a point.\n\nSo current head (4,2). If direction is DOWN (epoch 11), new head is (5,2). Then, in epoch 12, direction LEFT: new head (5,1), which is an apple. That would be safe. Let's confirm:\n\nEpoch 11: direction DOWN → head moves to (5,2). Check (5,2) is empty (yes, row 5 is \"# A    #\", column 2 is ' '). So that's safe. The body would shift: the new body would be (4,2) (old head), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3) (since the length is 6, so after moving, the tail (2,3) is removed? Wait, no: the snake's length is 6 (H + 5 S's). When moving, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail is removed. So the new body after moving DOWN would be H at (5,2), followed by S's at (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4). The tail (2,3) is removed. So the new body positions are (5,2) H, (4,2) S, (4,3) S, (4,4) S, (3,4) S, (2,4) S. Then, in epoch 12, direction LEFT: head moves to (5,1). Check (5,1) is 'A' (apple). So eating that apple would increase the score, and the snake grows by 1. So the tail isn't removed in that case. That's a good move.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake continues moving LEFT (epoch 11) to (4,1). Then in epoch 12, direction could be DOWN. Let's see: (4,1) → (5,1) (apple). Because (4,1) moving DOWN would be (5,1). (5,1) is an apple. So that's even better. Let's check that path.\n\nCurrent head (4,2). Current direction is LEFT. So if direction is LEFT (epoch 11), head moves to (4,1). (4,1) is ' ' (safe). Then, in epoch 12, direction can be DOWN (since current direction would be LEFT, so can't go RIGHT, but can go UP, DOWN, LEFT). So direction DOWN: head moves from (4,1) to (5,1). (5,1) is 'A' (apple). So that's even better. That's a two-step path to the apple.\n\nSo, in epoch 11, moving LEFT to (4,1) (safe), then epoch 12 moving DOWN to (5,1) (apple). That's possible. So moving LEFT now allows reaching the apple in the next step.\n\nBut what's (4,1) in the current board? Let's confirm. The current row 4 is \"#  HSS #\", which is:\n\nColumns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'H', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\n\nSo (4,1) is ' ', which is safe. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nAnother option: moving UP. Let's check (3,2). If the snake moves UP to (3,2), then what's next? The apples are (1,1), (5,1), (6,3). (3,2) is in row 3, column 2. From there, moving LEFT would go to (3,1), which is ' ' (row 3 is \"#    S #\", column 1 is ' '). Then (3,1) → moving LEFT again to (3,0) (wall, which is bad). So maybe not as good.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,2) as discussed. But the apple at (5,1) is to the left of (5,2). So moving DOWN then LEFT would get the apple.\n\nBut the apple at (5,1) is directly below and to the left of the current head. Current head (4,2). (5,1) is row 5, column 1. So the movement from (4,2) to (5,1) would require moving DOWN and LEFT. But since the snake can only change direction once per step, it can't move diagonally. So it has to go in one direction per step.\n\nSo the best path is to first move LEFT (epoch 11) to (4,1), then move DOWN (epoch 12) to (5,1) (apple). That's two steps.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT (epoch 11) to (4,1), then LEFT again (epoch 12) to (4,0) (wall → game over). So the snake must not continue LEFT after that. So the player needs to turn DOWN in epoch 12.\n\nBut the question is, what direction should be chosen in epoch 11 (current epoch) to maximize the chance of eating apples and surviving.\n\nThe possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's check for collisions in each possible direction.\n\nCurrent head (4,2). Directions:\n\n- LEFT → (4,1): safe (no wall, no body). Body parts are (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3). (4,1) is not among these. So safe.\n- UP → (3,2): check body. Body parts are (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4). (3,2) is not a body part. Safe.\n- DOWN → (5,2): check body. Body parts are the same as above. (5,2) is not a body part. Safe.\n\nSo all three directions are safe. Now, which direction leads towards an apple?\n\nThe apples are at (1,1), (5,1), (6,3).\n\nThe closest apple is (5,1). Let's calculate the distance from the head (4,2) to each apple:\n\n- (1,1): row difference 3 (4-1=3), column difference 1 (2-1=1). Total steps (if moving optimally) 3+1=4 steps.\n- (5,1): row difference 1 (5-4=1), column difference 1 (2-1=1). Total steps 2 steps (e.g., LEFT then DOWN, or DOWN then LEFT).\n- (6,3): row difference 2 (6-4=2), column difference 1 (3-2=1). Total steps 3 steps.\n\nSo (5,1) is the closest. So the snake should aim for (5,1).\n\nTo reach (5,1) from (4,2):\n\nPossible paths:\n\n1. Move LEFT to (4,1) (epoch 11), then move DOWN to (5,1) (epoch 12). That's 2 steps. (5,1) is an apple, so eating it in epoch 12.\n\n2. Move DOWN to (5,2) (epoch 11), then move LEFT to (5,1) (epoch 12). Also 2 steps.\n\nEither path works. Let's see which is better.\n\nIf in epoch 11, direction is LEFT:\n\n- New head (4,1). Check if (4,1) is safe. Yes.\n\nThen in epoch 12, direction is DOWN. New head (5,1), which is an apple. So that's good.\n\nIf in epoch 11, direction is DOWN:\n\n- New head (5,2). Check if (5,2) is safe. Yes.\n\nThen in epoch 12, direction is LEFT. New head (5,1), which is an apple. Also good.\n\nSo both directions (LEFT and DOWN in epoch 11) can lead to eating the apple in epoch 12. Which one is better? Let's check if there are any obstacles in the way.\n\nFor path 1 (LEFT then DOWN):\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (4,1), the next move DOWN to (5,1) is possible. (5,1) is an apple. No body parts in (5,1) (current board shows (5,1) is A). So that's safe.\n\nFor path 2 (DOWN then LEFT):\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (5,2), next move LEFT to (5,1) is possible. (5,1) is an apple. Also safe.\n\nSo which direction to choose in epoch 11? Since the current direction is LEFT, and the snake can continue moving LEFT (which is allowed), perhaps moving LEFT is better as it's the current direction, but the snake can change direction. However, the problem is to choose the best direction now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving LEFT now is better because (4,1) is adjacent to (5,1) (the apple) in the next step. Let's confirm.\n\nIf we move LEFT in epoch 11, head is (4,1). Then, moving DOWN in epoch 12, head is (5,1) (apple). That's correct.\n\nIf we move DOWN in epoch 11, head is (5,2). Then moving LEFT in epoch 12, head is (5,1) (apple). Also correct.\n\nSo both options are possible. Are there any other factors? Let's check the snake's body positions to avoid future collisions.\n\nCurrent body positions (excluding H):\n\n(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT to (4,1), the new body positions would be (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4). The tail (2,3) is removed. So the body is now along (4,2) → (4,3) → (4,4) → (3,4) → (2,4). So the body is in the right part of the board.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (5,2), the new body positions would be (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4). The tail (2,3) is removed. Same as above.\n\nSo the body structure is similar in both cases.\n\nAnother thing to consider: after eating the apple, the snake's length increases. So in epoch 12, if the head moves to (5,1) (apple), the snake's length becomes 7. The tail would not be removed. So the body would include the previous positions.\n\nBut perhaps the main consideration is to reach the apple as soon as possible. Both paths take two steps, so either direction (LEFT or DOWN) in epoch 11 is acceptable. But perhaps the best choice is to move LEFT, as the current direction is LEFT, and moving in the same direction is allowed and may be more straightforward. Alternatively, moving DOWN might be better if there's a risk in moving LEFT. Let's check (4,1) again. (4,1) is in row 4, column 1. The walls are at column 0, so (4,0) is a wall. So if the snake moves LEFT again in epoch 12, it would hit the wall, but the player can choose to turn DOWN instead. So as long as the player turns DOWN in epoch 12, it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN in epoch 11, then LEFT in epoch 12, also safe.\n\nHmm. But the question is to choose the direction for epoch 11. Since both options are safe and lead to the apple in the next step, but perhaps moving LEFT is better because it's the current direction and the snake can continue moving in that direction if needed, but I think either direction is possible. However, perhaps there's another apple that's closer. Let's check the apple at (6,3). The head is (4,2). To reach (6,3), the snake would need to move DOWN twice (to row 5, then row 6) and RIGHT once (to column 3). That's three steps. So (5,1) is better.\n\nAnother check: are there any body parts in the path of the possible moves. For example, if moving UP to (3,2), then what's around (3,2)? The body has (3,4) (S), so (3,2) is safe. But (3,2) is empty, so no problem.\n\nBut since the closest apple is (5,1), the best strategy is to move towards it. So between moving LEFT or DOWN in epoch 11, both lead towards (5,1). Which is better?\n\nLet me think again. The head is at (4,2). (5,1) is down one, left one. So to get there, the snake can either go left first (to (4,1)), then down (to (5,1)), or down first (to (5,2)), then left (to (5,1)). Both are two steps. Since the current direction is LEFT, moving LEFT now (epoch 11) is allowed (since it's not reversing). Then, in epoch 12, direction can be DOWN (allowed, since current direction would be LEFT, so can't go RIGHT, but can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT). So moving LEFT now, then DOWN next step. That's feasible.\n\nSo the best direction for epoch 11 is LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#  HSS #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4,2) (row 4, column 2), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). The possible directions to choose are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n### Analysis of possible moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (4,2) leads to (4,1). This cell is empty (no wall or body collision). This move keeps the snake on a path toward the apple at (5,1) (row 5, column 1), which is the closest apple. From (4,1), the snake can then move DOWN in the next epoch to reach (5,1) (the apple).  \n2. **UP**: Moving UP from (4,2) leads to (3,2). This cell is empty, but it does not directly approach any apple. The closest apple (5,1) would require more steps to reach from (3,2).  \n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (4,2) leads to (5,2). This cell is empty, but it also requires an additional LEFT move to reach the apple at (5,1), similar to the LEFT path but with one extra step in the opposite direction initially.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT in the current epoch (11) is optimal. It keeps the snake on a direct path toward the nearest apple at (5,1), allowing the snake to reach and eat the apple in the next epoch (12) by moving DOWN. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n# HSSS #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 12. The snake is moving left, so its head (H) is at some position. Let's map the coordinates. Let's assume the top-left corner is (0,0), rows are y-coordinates, columns are x-coordinates. The board is 8x8, with walls (#######) on the edges. So row 0 and row 7 are all walls. The inner rows are 1 to 6.\n\nLooking at row 4 (since rows are 0-based, the 5th line is row 4), which is \"# HSSS #\". Let's break that down. The row starts with #, then space, H, S, S, S, space, #. So positions (4,1) is space, (4,2) is H (head), (4,3) is S, (4,4) is S, (4,5) is S, (4,6) is space, (4,7) is #. So the head (H) is at (y=4, x=2). The body segments (S) are at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nLooking at row 3: \"#    S #\". That's row 3, which is the 4th line. Breaking it down: #, space, space, space, space, S, space, #. So (3,5) is S.\n\nRow 2: \"#    S #\". So (2,5) is S.\n\nSo the snake's body is a chain. Let's track the snake's body segments in order. The head is at (4,2). The next segment is (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So the snake's length is 6 (head + 5 S's). Because the snake starts with length 1, each apple eaten adds 1, so the snake has eaten 5 apples so far.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left, so the next head position would be (4,1) if moving left. Let's check if that's a valid move.\n\nFirst, check for walls. The walls are at x=0 and x=7 (since each row starts and ends with #). The head is at (4,2), moving left to (4,1). x=1 is within 1-6 (since x=0 is wall), so that's not a wall collision. Now check for self-collision. The current body positions are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). (4,1) is a space (from row 4: \"# HSSS #\", so (4,1) is space). So moving left to (4,1) is safe.\n\nBut wait, are there any apples in the path? Let's check the current positions of apples. The apples (A) are in row 1: \"# A    #\", so (1,1) is A. Row 5: \"# A    #\", (5,1) is A. Row 6: \"#   A  #\", (6,3) is A. So (4,1) is a space, not an apple. So moving left would not eat an apple. The snake would move, with the head at (4,1), and the body segments shifting: the previous head (4,2) becomes S, (4,3) stays S, etc. The tail (which was (2,5)) would move if the snake doesn't grow. Since the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail would remove the last segment. Wait, no: the snake's length is 6. When moving, if it doesn't eat an apple, the snake moves forward, adding a new head and removing the tail. So the new head is (4,1), then the body becomes (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). The previous tail at (2,5) is removed.\n\nBut maybe there's a better direction. The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is LEFT, so the snake can't go RIGHT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (continue current direction).\n\nLet's check possible directions:\n\n1. LEFT (current direction): next head (4,1). Check for collision: (4,1) is space. Safe. No apple here. So snake moves, tail (2,5) is removed. New body positions: (4,1) H, (4,2) S, (4,3) S, (4,4) S, (4,5) S, (3,5) S. The tail (2,5) is gone.\n\n2. UP: can the snake turn UP? The current direction is LEFT, so turning UP is allowed (not reversing). UP direction would mean the head moves from (4,2) to (3,2). Let's check (3,2). Row 3 is \"#    S #\", which is (3,0) #, (3,1) space, (3,2) space, (3,3) space, (3,4) space, (3,5) S, (3,6) space, (3,7) #. So (3,2) is space. Check if that's a body part. Current body is (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). (3,2) is not a body part. So safe. Is there an apple at (3,2)? No. The apples are at (1,1), (5,1), (6,3). So moving UP would take the head to (3,2). No apple, so snake moves, tail (2,5) is removed.\n\n3. DOWN: can the snake turn DOWN? Current direction is LEFT, so DOWN is allowed (not reversing). DOWN direction: head moves from (4,2) to (5,2). Check (5,2). Row 5 is \"# A    #\": (5,0) #, (5,1) A, (5,2) space, (5,3) space, (5,4) space, (5,5) space, (5,6) space, (5,7) #. So (5,2) is space. Check for body collision. Body parts are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). (5,2) is not a body part. So safe. No apple here.\n\n4. RIGHT: cannot turn RIGHT because current direction is LEFT (reverse direction). So invalid.\n\nSo all possible directions (LEFT, UP, DOWN) are safe. Now, which direction leads to an apple next?\n\nWe need to look for apples. The apples are at (1,1), (5,1), (6,3). Let's see the positions:\n\n- (1,1): top middle-left.\n- (5,1): row 5, column 1 (so y=5, x=1).\n- (6,3): row 6, column 3 (y=6, x=3).\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,2). Let's think about the path to the apples.\n\nIf the snake continues moving LEFT (to (4,1)), next step, direction can be adjusted. (4,1) is (y=4, x=1). From there, possible directions (since current direction would be LEFT, can't go RIGHT). Maybe UP or DOWN. (4,1) is adjacent to (3,1) (UP) and (5,1) (DOWN). (5,1) is an apple! Oh, (5,1) is A. So if the snake moves LEFT to (4,1), then next move could be DOWN to (5,1), which is an apple. That would be good. Because (5,1) is A. So moving LEFT now would position the head to (4,1), then next move DOWN to (5,1) (apple), which would grow the snake and increase the score.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves DOWN now to (5,2), then from there, moving LEFT to (5,1) (which is A) in the next step. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head (4,2). If direction is DOWN, next head (5,2). Then, next direction could be LEFT (since current direction would be DOWN, can't go UP). So moving LEFT from (5,2) to (5,1), which is A. That's also possible. So moving DOWN now, then LEFT next step would reach the apple.\n\nBut which path is shorter? Let's see. The apple at (5,1) is in row 5, column 1. From current head (4,2):\n\nIf move LEFT to (4,1), then DOWN to (5,1): that's two steps. The apple is in (5,1), which is directly below (4,1).\n\nIf move DOWN to (5,2), then LEFT to (5,1): that's also two steps. So both paths take two steps.\n\nAnother apple is at (6,3). (6,3) is in row 6, column 3. Current head (4,2). To reach (6,3), the snake would need to move DOWN twice (to (5,2), (6,2)) then RIGHT to (6,3). That's three steps. So (6,3) is a bit further.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is in row 1, column 1. That's up and left from current head. The snake is at (4,2). To get there, it would need to move UP three times (to (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)) then LEFT to (1,1). That's four steps, which is longer.\n\nSo the closest apples are (5,1) and (6,3) perhaps. Let's recheck the apple positions.\n\nWait, row 5 is \"# A    #\". So (5,1) is A. Row 6 is \"#   A  #\". Let's parse row 6: the row starts with #, then space, space, space, A, space, space, #. So (6,4) is A? Wait, let's check again. The row is \"#   A  #\". Let's count the positions (columns 0 to 7):\n\nColumn 0: #\nColumn 1: space\nColumn 2: space\nColumn 3: space\nColumn 4: A\nColumn 5: space\nColumn 6: space\nColumn 7: #\nSo (6,4) is A, not (6,3). Oh, that's a mistake earlier. So the apples are:\n\nRow 1 (second line): \"# A    #\": (1,1) is A (columns 0 is #, 1 is A, 2-6 are spaces, 7 is #).\n\nRow 5 (sixth line): \"# A    #\": (5,1) is A.\n\nRow 6 (seventh line): \"#   A  #\": (6,4) is A (columns 0: #, 1-3: spaces, 4: A, 5-6: spaces, 7: #).\n\nSo apple positions are (1,1), (5,1), (6,4).\n\nSo (5,1) is in row 5, column 1. (6,4) is row 6, column 4.\n\nCurrent head is (4,2). Let's see directions again.\n\nIf moving LEFT to (4,1):\n\nNext position (4,1). From there, possible directions (since current direction would be LEFT, so can't go RIGHT). So possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nIf direction from (4,1) is DOWN, then head moves to (5,1) which is A. That's perfect. So moving LEFT now allows the next move to reach the apple in (5,1) in the next step.\n\nIf we move LEFT now, then next step (epoch 13) direction is DOWN (from (4,1) to (5,1)), which is an apple. That would be good.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT now, the new head is (4,1), which is safe (no collision). Then, in the next move, direction DOWN would take it to (5,1) (apple), which is a valid move (since current direction would be LEFT, turning DOWN is allowed). So that's a good path.\n\nOther options: moving UP. If the snake moves UP now (from (4,2) to (3,2)), then next positions. (3,2) is space. Then possible directions (current direction is UP, so can't go DOWN). Possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, UP. But the snake can't reverse direction. So from (3,2), moving LEFT would go to (3,1), which is space. Then from (3,1), moving DOWN to (4,1), then (5,1) (apple). That's longer. So moving UP might not be as efficient.\n\nMoving DOWN now (from (4,2) to (5,2)): (5,2) is space. Then next direction could be LEFT (since current direction would be DOWN, can't go UP). So from (5,2) moving LEFT to (5,1) (apple). That's also two steps. So that's another path.\n\nSo between moving LEFT and moving DOWN, both can reach the (5,1) apple in two steps. Which is better?\n\nBut let's check if moving LEFT now would cause any issues. The snake's body after moving LEFT would be:\n\nHead at (4,1). The body segments would be (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). The tail was (2,5), which is removed. So the new body is (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). Are there any collisions possible in the next steps? Probably not.\n\nIf moving DOWN now (to (5,2)), the new body would be (4,2) becomes S, (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) (since the tail was (2,5), and since the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail is removed. Wait, no. The snake's length is 6 (head + 5 S). When moving, if it doesn't eat an apple, the snake moves by adding a new head and removing the last tail segment. So the current body is [H at (4,2), S at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]. So when moving, the new head is (new position), and the tail (2,5) is removed. So after moving, the body becomes [new head, (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)].\n\nSo, moving LEFT: new head (4,1), body segments (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5).\n\nMoving DOWN: new head (5,2), body segments (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5).\n\nSo both options are safe.\n\nNow, which direction should be chosen? The goal is to eat as many apples as possible. The (5,1) apple is the closest. So moving LEFT now allows the next step to reach (5,1) via DOWN. Alternatively, moving DOWN now allows next step to reach (5,1) via LEFT.\n\nBut let's check the direction constraints. After moving LEFT, the current direction becomes LEFT, so the next direction can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT (can't reverse to RIGHT). So from (4,1), moving DOWN is allowed (since current direction is LEFT, turning DOWN is allowed).\n\nAfter moving DOWN, the current direction becomes DOWN, so next direction can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (can't reverse to UP). So from (5,2), moving LEFT is allowed (since current direction is DOWN, turning LEFT is allowed).\n\nSo both paths are possible. Which one is better?\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's body positions. Let's see the current body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). If the snake moves LEFT, the new body is (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). So the tail is now (3,5). If the snake moves DOWN, the new body is (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). Same as moving LEFT? No, because the new head is (5,2), so the body would be (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). The tail is (3,5) in both cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving LEFT is better because (5,1) is directly below (4,1), so the next move is straightforward. Let's imagine the next step.\n\nIf we choose LEFT now, the next head is (4,1). Then, the player can input DOWN, moving to (5,1) (apple). That would eat the apple, grow the snake, and increase the score.\n\nIf we choose DOWN now, the next head is (5,2). Then, input LEFT to move to (5,1) (apple). Also eats the apple.\n\nSo both directions (LEFT and DOWN) are valid and lead to an apple in the next step. Are there any other factors? Let's check if there are any potential collisions in the next steps.\n\nFor example, if moving LEFT now, then next step moving DOWN to (5,1): (5,1) is an apple. The new head is (5,1), and since it's an apple, the snake grows. So the body would be (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). The tail (3,5) is not removed because the snake ate an apple (length increases by 1). So the new length is 7.\n\nIf moving DOWN now, then next step moving LEFT to (5,1): same result. The snake eats the apple, grows.\n\nBut perhaps the current direction is LEFT, and the snake is moving left. The snake's body is to the right of the head. So the snake is moving left, with the body following to the right. So moving left continues the current path, which might be more natural. Alternatively, moving down could lead to other apples.\n\nAnother apple is at (6,4). Let's see the position (6,4). From (5,1) (after eating the apple), the snake's head is at (5,1). Then, to reach (6,4), the snake could move RIGHT (if direction allows). But after eating the apple, the direction would be DOWN (if the previous move was DOWN from (4,1) to (5,1)), so the current direction would be DOWN, so can't reverse to UP. Alternatively, direction could be RIGHT if possible.\n\nBut perhaps the immediate next apple is (5,1), and either direction (LEFT or DOWN) can reach it. So which direction to choose? Since the problem requires to choose one of the directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN), and RIGHT is invalid (reverse), UP and DOWN and LEFT are possible.\n\nThe question is to choose the best direction. Since moving LEFT is the current direction, and it's allowed, and moving LEFT leads to a position from which the next move can reach an apple, perhaps LEFT is the best choice. Alternatively, moving DOWN also works.\n\nWait, let's check the current board again. The snake's body in row 2 and 3: (2,5) and (3,5) are S. The head is at (4,2), with body to the right (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), then up to (3,5), (2,5). So the snake is shaped like a horizontal line from (4,2) to (4,5), then up to (3,5), (2,5). So the snake's body is to the right and up.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT (current direction), it's moving away from its body, which is safer. Moving UP would take it into row 3, which has (3,5) as S, but (3,2) is empty. Moving DOWN takes it to row 5, which is empty except for (5,1) A. So all directions are safe.\n\nIn the absence of immediate danger, the best strategy is to move towards the nearest apple. The nearest apple is (5,1). So moving LEFT now allows the next step to reach (5,1) via DOWN. So the answer would be LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n# HSSS #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT  \nCurrent epoch: 12  \n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's position, possible moves, and apple locations. The snake's head (H) is at (4,2) (row 4, column 2). The body segments (S) are at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), and (2,5). Apples (A) are at (1,1), (5,1), and (6,4).  \n\n### Possible Moves (Cannot reverse direction, so RIGHT is invalid):  \n1. **LEFT (Current Direction):** The head moves to (4,1). This position is empty (no wall or self-collision). From (4,1), the next move can be DOWN to (5,1), which contains an apple. This path safely leads to an apple in the next step.  \n2. **UP:** The head moves to (3,2). This position is empty, but it is farther from the nearest apple (5,1) compared to moving LEFT.  \n3. **DOWN:** The head moves to (5,2). This position is empty, but reaching the nearest apple (5,1) from (5,2) requires an additional LEFT move, which is equivalent in steps to the LEFT path but less direct.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving LEFT maintains the current direction, avoids collisions, and positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (5,1) in the next step.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # A    # (so position (1,1) is A, others in this row are spaces except the walls)\nRow 2: #      # (all spaces except walls)\nRow 3: #    S # (so (3,4) is S)\nRow 4: #HSSSS # (So positions here: (4,1) is H (head), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are S (body segments). Because the snake's head is H, and the body follows. Since the current direction is LEFT, the snake is moving left, which means the next position for the head would be to the left (column decreases by 1).\n\nRow 5: # A    # (so (5,1) is A)\nRow 6: #   A  # (so (6,3) is A)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nFirst, let's confirm the snake's body positions. The head is at (4,1). Then the body segments are S's. The snake's length is 5 (H plus 4 S's). Since the current direction is LEFT, the previous movement was left. So the head was moving left, and the body follows. Let's reconstruct the snake's path. When moving left, each body part takes the position of the previous part. So the head (H) is at (4,1), next body segment (S) is at (4,2) (since before the last move, the head was at (4,2), then moved left to (4,1), so (4,2) becomes the next body part). Then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are the rest of the body. So the snake's body is in positions (4,1) [H], (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nNow, the current direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction. So if current direction is LEFT, the possible directions to turn are UP or DOWN. Because reversing would be RIGHT, which is not allowed. So the possible next directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT (since the snake can keep moving in the same direction unless it's a reverse). Wait, the problem says \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So if the current direction is LEFT, the next direction can be LEFT (continue), UP, or DOWN. Because turning to RIGHT is a reverse, which is not allowed. So possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nNow, we need to check where the head would move if we choose each possible direction, and see if that leads to a collision (with walls or self), or if it's an apple.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,1) (row 4, column 1). Let's index rows from 0 (top) to 7 (bottom), columns from 0 (left) to 7 (right).\n\nSo (row, column):\n\nRow 0: columns 0-7 are all #\nRow 1: columns 0 and 7 are #, column 1 is A, others (2-6) are space\nRow 2: columns 0 and 7 are #, 1-6 are space\nRow 3: columns 0 and 7 are #, column 4 is S, others (1-3,5-6) are space\nRow 4: columns 0 and 7 are #, column 1 is H, columns 2-5 are S, column 6 is space\nRow 5: columns 0 and 7 are #, column 1 is A, others (2-6) are space\nRow 6: columns 0 and 7 are #, column 3 is A, others (1-2,4-6) are space\nRow 7: columns 0-7 are #\n\nSo head is at (4,1). Let's check possible directions:\n\n1. LEFT direction: moving left would take the head to (4,0). But column 0 is a wall (since all edges are #). So moving left here would hit the wall. That's a collision, game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n2. UP direction: moving up. The head's current position is (4,1). Moving up would take it to (3,1). Let's check what's at (3,1). Row 3, column 1. Looking at row 3: \"#    S #\", which is columns 0: #, 1: (space), 2: (space), 3: (space), 4: S, 5: (space), 6: (space), 7: #. So (3,1) is a space. So moving up to (3,1). Now, check if that position is part of the snake's body. The snake's body is at (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (3,1) is not in those positions, so no collision. So moving UP is safe. Also, is there an apple at (3,1)? Let's check. Row 3, column 1: no, that's a space. So the snake would move there, the body would follow. The new head is (3,1), the old head (4,1) becomes S, and the last body segment (4,5) would be removed only if the snake didn't eat an apple. Wait, no. When the snake moves, if it eats an apple (head moves to A), then the snake grows, so the tail doesn't get removed. Otherwise, the tail is removed (since the length remains the same). Current snake length is 5 (H + 4 S). So if it moves to a space (not A), the tail (the last S) is removed. Let's confirm: the example given in the problem says when the snake moves to an apple, it grows. So when moving to A, the length increases by 1 (so tail is not removed). Otherwise, the tail is removed (so length remains same). So in this case, moving UP to (3,1) (a space), the snake's body would shift: new head (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). The previous tail was (4,5), which would be removed (so the new body ends at (4,4)). So the new body positions would be (3,1) [H], (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) [S's]. That's okay, no collision.\n\n3. DOWN direction: moving down. The head is at (4,1). Moving down would take it to (5,1). Let's check (5,1). Row 5 is \"# A    #\", so column 1 is A. Oh! So (5,1) is an apple. So if the snake moves DOWN, the head moves to (5,1), which is an A. Then, the snake eats the apple, score increases by 1, and the snake grows in length. So the body would not lose the tail. The new head is (5,1). The old head (4,1) becomes S, and the body segments shift. The previous body was (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So after moving down, the new body would be (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Because the snake grows, the tail (4,5) is not removed. So the new snake would have length 6 (H at (5,1), followed by 5 S's). Also, we need to check if (5,1) is a collision. Since it's an apple (not a wall or body part), it's safe. So moving DOWN would result in eating an apple, which is good.\n\nNow, let's check if moving DOWN would cause a collision. The new head position (5,1) is an A, so no collision. The body is (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So (5,1) is not part of the body, so no self-collision. So moving DOWN is safe and rewards with an apple.\n\nWhat about other directions? Let's recap:\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. But LEFT leads to wall (column 0), which is a loss. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo between UP and DOWN. Moving DOWN leads to eating an apple, which is better. So the best direction is DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#HSSSS #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state and possible moves:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (4,1) (row 4, column 1). The body ('S') occupies (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). The current direction is LEFT.\n\n2. **Movement Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT → RIGHT is invalid). Valid directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\n3. **Checking Each Direction**:\n   - **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (4,0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n   - **UP**: Moving up takes the head to (3,1). This position is empty (no wall, no body, no apple). The snake would move safely but not eat an apple. **Safe but no reward**.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving down takes the head to (5,1), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, grows the snake, and avoids collision (no wall or body in this position). **Safe and rewarding**.\n\nThe best move is DOWN, as it allows the snake to eat an apple without collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#SSSSS #\n#HA    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, and the current epoch is 14. The snake's head is 'H', body segments are 'S'. Let's map out the positions. The board is 8x8, with walls ('#') around the edges.\n\nLet's list the rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7):\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # A    # → positions (1,1) is 'A', others are empty except walls.\nRow 2: #      # → all empty except walls.\nRow 3: #      # → same as row 2.\nRow 4: #SSSSS # → columns 1 to 5 are 'S' (since 1-based or 0-based? Let's assume rows and columns are 0-based. So row 4, columns 1-5 are 'S's. So (4,1)=S, (4,2)=S, (4,3)=S, (4,4)=S, (4,5)=S.\nRow 5: #HA    # → (5,1)=H (head), (5,2)=A (apple), others in row 5 are empty except walls.\nRow 6: #   A  # → (6,3)=A (apple), others empty except walls.\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN. The snake moves one square per step in the current direction. The snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is DOWN, the previous direction was not UP (since reversing is not allowed). The next direction can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT, but not the reverse. Wait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, the example says if current direction is UP, you can't turn to DOWN. So if current direction is DOWN, you can't turn to UP. Because reversing would be changing from DOWN to UP (since moving down, then up would reverse the direction). So allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since that's the current direction). Because the player can choose to keep moving in the same direction or turn left\/right, but not reverse.\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,1). Current direction is DOWN, so the next position if moving DOWN would be (6,1). Let's check that position.\n\nRow 6 is #   A  #. So (6,0) is '#', (6,1) is ' ' (empty), (6,2) is ' ', (6,3) is 'A', (6,4) is ' ', (6,5) is ' ', (6,6) is ' ', (6,7) is '#'. So (6,1) is empty. So if the snake moves DOWN to (6,1), what happens? The snake's body will follow. Let's think about the snake's body. The current snake's body is in row 4, columns 1-5 (SSSSS). The head is in row 5, column 1 (H). So the snake's body is a line. Let's reconstruct the snake's path. The head is at (5,1). The body segments are behind it. Since the snake was moving DOWN, the previous position of the head must have been (4,1), which is now part of the body (S). Then the next body segments are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So the snake's body is a horizontal line in row 4, from (4,1) to (4,5), and the head is at (5,1), moving down. So the snake's length is 1 (head) + 5 (body) = 6? Because when the snake moves, the body follows. Each move, the head moves forward, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the current body is 5 S's, meaning the snake has a length of 6 (since head + 5 body segments).\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN (current direction), the new head position is (6,1). The rest of the body will shift. The previous head position (5,1) becomes a body segment (S), and each body segment in (4,1), (4,2), etc., shifts. So the new body would be (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) → but wait, the length is 6, so the body after moving would have 5 segments. Let's think: when the snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each body part moves to the position of the previous part. So original positions (from head to tail):\n\nHead: (5,1)\n\nBody 1: (4,1) (since moving down, previous head position)\n\nBody 2: (4,2)\n\nBody 3: (4,3)\n\nBody 4: (4,4)\n\nBody 5: (4,5)\n\nSo when moving down, the new head is (6,1). The new body 1 is (5,1), body 2 is (4,1), body 3 is (4,2), body 4 is (4,3), body 5 is (4,4). The tail (originally (4,5)) would be removed, unless the snake ate an apple. Because when the snake eats an apple, it grows, so the tail doesn't move (so the length increases by 1). So if the head moves to a square with an apple, the snake's length increases by 1, and the tail doesn't drop. Otherwise, the tail drops, keeping the length the same.\n\nSo in the current scenario, the next move: if the head moves to (6,1), which is empty (no apple), then the snake's length remains 6. The tail (originally (4,5)) would be removed (so that square becomes empty). So the new body would be (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), and the new head (6,1). The square (4,5) becomes empty.\n\nBut let's check possible apples. The apples are at (1,1), (5,2), (6,3). So the current head is at (5,1). The square to the right (5,2) is an apple (A). So if the snake turns RIGHT (direction RIGHT), the head would move to (5,2), which is an apple. That's a good move because eating the apple would increase the score and the snake grows. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake can turn to LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. Turning to UP is not allowed (reverse direction). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nIf the direction is RIGHT, then the head moves from (5,1) to (5,2). (5,2) is an apple (A). So eating that apple. Then the snake's length increases by 1, so the tail (4,5) remains. The new head is (5,2), which was an apple. The body segments would be:\n\nOriginal positions:\n\nHead: (5,1)\n\nBody 1: (4,1)\n\nBody 2: (4,2)\n\nBody 3: (4,3)\n\nBody 4: (4,4)\n\nBody 5: (4,5)\n\nAfter moving RIGHT (to (5,2)), since it's an apple, the tail (4,5) stays. So the new body segments are:\n\nHead: (5,2)\n\nBody 1: (5,1) (previous head position)\n\nBody 2: (4,1)\n\nBody 3: (4,2)\n\nBody 4: (4,3)\n\nBody 5: (4,4)\n\nBody 6: (4,5) (since we ate an apple, length increases by 1)\n\nSo the new board would have the head at (5,2), body segments at (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). The square (5,2) was 'A' and becomes 'H'. The square (5,1) becomes 'S'. The apple at (5,2) is eaten, so a new apple would be generated? Wait, the problem says \"the game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board.\" So when the snake eats an apple, does a new one spawn? The example shows that after eating an apple, the next state has another apple. Let's check the example given:\n\nOriginal example board:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAfter moving DOWN, the new board is:\n\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nIn the original, there were 3 apples (positions (1,5), (4,1), (4,2)). After moving down, the head (H) was at (3,1) moving down to (4,1) which is an apple. The new head is (4,1) (now H), and the previous head (3,1) becomes S. The apples left are (1,5), (4,2), and a new one at (1,3). So it seems that when an apple is eaten, a new one is placed. So the number of apples remains 3. So in our current scenario, if we eat the apple at (5,2), that apple is removed, and a new one is placed elsewhere. But the problem says \"the game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.\" So perhaps the number of apples remains 3. So after eating, a new apple is generated. But the exact position isn't specified here.\n\nBut back to the movement. Let's check possible directions:\n\nOption 1: Continue DOWN. New head position (6,1). Is that safe? Let's check for collisions. The new head (6,1) is in row 6, column 1. The walls are at column 0 and 7, row 0 and 7. So (6,1) is within the board (row 6 is valid, column 1 is valid, not a wall). Now, check if the new head position collides with the body. The body segments are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,1). The new head is (6,1). None of the body segments are at (6,1), so no collision. So moving DOWN is safe. But (6,1) is empty, so no apple eaten.\n\nOption 2: Turn LEFT. Current direction is DOWN. Turning LEFT would mean the snake's direction becomes LEFT. So the head moves from (5,1) to (5,0). But (5,0) is a wall (since the first character in row 5 is '#'). So moving LEFT would hit the wall, causing a collision. Game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nOption 3: Turn RIGHT. Direction becomes RIGHT. Head moves from (5,1) to (5,2). (5,2) is an apple (A). So the snake eats the apple. Check if (5,2) is a wall or body. (5,2) is not a wall (row 5, column 2 is within the board, since row 5's structure is #HA    #, so columns 0 is #, 1 is H, 2 is A, 3-6 are spaces, 7 is #). So (5,2) is valid. Check collision with body. The body is (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,1). (5,2) is not in the body positions, so no collision. So moving RIGHT is safe and will eat an apple. That's good because it increases the score and the snake grows.\n\nOption 4: Turn UP. But current direction is DOWN. Turning UP is reversing direction, which is not allowed. So UP is invalid.\n\nSo the possible directions are DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is invalid (wall), UP is invalid (reverse). So between DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nMoving RIGHT would eat the apple at (5,2). That's better than moving DOWN (which doesn't eat anything). So the best choice is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#SSSSS #\n#HA    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state:\n- **Snake Position**: Head ('H') is at (row 5, column 1). The body ('S') spans row 4, columns 1-5.\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot turn UP).\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 1, column 1), (row 5, column 2), and (row 6, column 3).\n- **Valid Moves**: Since the current direction is DOWN, allowed directions are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (UP is invalid as it reverses direction).\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 5, column 0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (row 6, column 1), an empty space. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow. **Safe but no score gain**.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (row 5, column 2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. The new head position (row 5, column 2) is not a wall or body segment, so no collision occurs. **Safe and beneficial**.\n\nThe best move is to turn RIGHT, as it allows the snake to eat an apple and grow without collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # A  A # (so positions (1,1) and (1,4) are apples)\nRow 2: #      # (empty)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #SSSSS # (so positions (4,1) to (4,5) are 'S' (body))\nRow 5: #SH    # (here, (5,1) is 'S' (body), (5,2) is 'H' (head))\nRow 6: #   A  # (position (6,3) is 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right. The snake's head is at (5,2) (row 5, column 2, since rows are 0-7 and columns 0-7). Let's confirm the snake's body positions. The head is at (5,2). The body in row 5 is (5,1) as 'S'. Then row 4 has 'SSSSS' from column 1 to 5. So the snake's body is a vertical line? Let's track the snake's path. The head is at (5,2). The body behind it is (5,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Wait, row 4 is #SSSSS#, so columns 1-5 are S. So (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Then row 5 has #SH    #, which is (5,1) S and (5,2) H. So the snake's body is: (4,5) → (4,4) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (4,1) → (5,1) → (5,2) H. So the snake is moving in the RIGHT direction. So the next move direction can't be LEFT (since you can't reverse direction; current is RIGHT, so can't go LEFT). Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n\nLet's check the next position if we move RIGHT. The head is at (5,2). Moving RIGHT would take it to (5,3). Let's check what's there. The current row 5 is #SH    #. So (5,3) is empty (since columns 0 is #, 1 is S, 2 is H, 3-6 are spaces, 7 is #). So (5,3) is empty. No collision with walls (since column 3 is within 1-6, walls are at 0 and 7). Also, check if (5,3) is part of the snake's body. The snake's body is (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). So (5,3) is not part of the body. So moving RIGHT is safe. But is there an apple there? Let's check the apples. Apples are at (1,1), (1,4), (6,3). (5,3) is empty, so no apple. So the snake would move to (5,3), and the body would shift. The tail (the end of the body) is (4,5). Since no apple is eaten, the tail would move, so (4,5) would become empty, and the new head is (5,3), and the body follows. So new positions would be (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2) as S, and (5,3) as H.\n\nWhat if we turn UP? Current direction is RIGHT, so turning UP is allowed (not reversing). The head is at (5,2). Moving UP would take it to (4,2). Let's check (4,2). The current row 4 is #SSSSS#, so (4,2) is part of the body (since row 4 has S from column 1-5). So (4,2) is S. That's a self-collision. So moving UP would cause the snake to hit itself. That's bad. So UP is invalid.\n\nWhat about DOWN? Current direction is RIGHT, so turning DOWN is allowed. The head is at (5,2). Moving DOWN would take it to (6,2). Let's check row 6: #   A  #. Columns 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is space, 3 is A, 4 is space, 5 is space, 6 is space, 7 is #. So (6,2) is empty. No wall collision (column 2 is between 1-6). Check body: the body is (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). (6,2) is not part of the body, so safe. Is there an apple at (6,2)? No, the apple in row 6 is at (6,3). So moving DOWN would take the head to (6,2), which is safe. No apple eaten here.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about apples. The apples are at (1,1), (1,4), (6,3). The snake's head is at (5,2). Let's see possible moves towards apples.\n\nIf the snake continues RIGHT (current direction), next position (5,3). Then next move could be RIGHT again to (5,4). Let's check (5,4) in row 5: #SH    #. So (5,4) is space. Then after that, (5,5), (5,6) (but row 5's columns 5 and 6 are space). Then perhaps towards (1,4) apple (row 1, column 4). But that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,2), then maybe RIGHT to (6,3), which is an apple. That's a good target. Let's see: current head (5,2). If we move DOWN to (6,2) (direction DOWN). Then next possible direction (since current direction would be DOWN), next move could be RIGHT (since can't reverse, so can't go UP). Then from (6,2) moving RIGHT to (6,3), which is the apple. That would be a good move. So if we choose DOWN now, then next move can be RIGHT to get the apple. But need to check if that's possible.\n\nBut first, let's check if moving DOWN is possible. The head at (5,2) moving DOWN to (6,2) is safe. So that's a valid direction.\n\nWhat about moving RIGHT? The next position (5,3) is safe, but no apple. Then, if we continue moving RIGHT, next position (5,4). Then (5,5), (5,6). But (5,6) is column 6, row 5. The row 5 is #SH    #, columns 0 is #, 1 S, 2 H, 3-6 spaces. So (5,6) is space. Then (5,7) is wall (column 7), so can't go there. So moving RIGHT would take the snake towards the right, but there's an apple at (1,4) (row 1, column 4). To reach that, the snake would need to go up, but maybe there's a body in the way.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,3) is in row 6, column 3. The head is at (5,2). If we go DOWN to (6,2), then RIGHT to (6,3) (which is the apple), that's two steps. That's a good path. So the first step (current move) would be DOWN. Then next move RIGHT to get the apple.\n\nSo the possible directions are RIGHT, DOWN. UP is invalid (collision). LEFT is invalid (reverse direction).\n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. Let's see which is better. If we choose RIGHT, the snake moves to (5,3). Then next direction could be DOWN (since current direction would be RIGHT, so can turn DOWN). Then from (5,3) moving DOWN to (6,3), which is the apple. Oh, that's even better. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head (5,2). Current direction RIGHT. If we keep direction RIGHT, move to (5,3). Then, next move direction could be DOWN (since current direction is RIGHT, so allowed). Then from (5,3) moving DOWN to (6,3) (the apple's position). So that would get the apple in the next step.\n\nWait, (5,3) moving DOWN is (6,3). (6,3) is the apple. So that's a better path. So moving RIGHT now, then next move DOWN to get the apple. Let's confirm.\n\nCurrent head (5,2). Move RIGHT to (5,3) (safe, no collision). Then, next direction can be DOWN (since current direction is RIGHT, can turn to DOWN). Then, moving DOWN from (5,3) to (6,3), which is the apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if we move DOWN now (head to (6,2)), then next direction could be RIGHT (since current direction would be DOWN, so can turn RIGHT). Then from (6,2) moving RIGHT to (6,3) (apple). That's also two steps. Either way, the apple at (6,3) can be reached in two steps.\n\nBut what about the current possible moves. The question is, which direction should we choose now (epoch 15) to avoid collision and get apples.\n\nAnother thing to check: the snake's body. Let's list all the body positions. The head is at (5,2). The body is:\n\n- The immediate body behind the head is (5,1) (since row 5 is #SH..., so (5,1) is S, (5,2) H). Then, the body continues into row 4. Row 4 is #SSSSS#, so (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are S. So the snake's body is a sequence: (4,5) → (4,4) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (4,1) → (5,1) → (5,2) H. So the snake's length is 7 (since there are 6 S and 1 H, total 7 segments).\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (5,3), then the new head is (5,3). The body segments shift: the tail (4,5) would be removed (since no apple is eaten), so the new body positions would be (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2). Then the head is (5,3). That's safe.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (6,2), the new head is (6,2). The body shifts: tail (4,5) is removed, new body positions are (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2). Then head is (6,2). That's also safe.\n\nSo both directions are safe. But which one leads to getting an apple faster.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is in row 6, column 3. Let's see the distance. From (5,2) (current head), moving RIGHT to (5,3) (distance 1 from (6,3): (5,3) to (6,3) is down one step). From (5,3), moving down to (6,3) (apple). So that's two steps (current move RIGHT, next move DOWN).\n\nIf we move DOWN to (6,2) now, then next move RIGHT to (6,3) (apple). That's also two steps (current move DOWN, next move RIGHT).\n\nEither path works. But perhaps moving RIGHT is better because it's the current direction, and changing direction might not be necessary. But the problem is to choose the best direction. Are there any other factors?\n\nLet's check for possible collisions in the next steps. For example, if we move RIGHT now to (5,3), then the next direction could be DOWN. The next position (6,3) is the apple. So that's good. So that's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, if we move DOWN to (6,2), then next move RIGHT to (6,3) (apple). Also good.\n\nBut perhaps there's another apple. The other apples are at (1,1) and (1,4). Let's see. The apple at (1,4) is in row 1, column 4. The snake's current position is in row 5, column 2. To reach (1,4), the snake would need to move up, but the body is in row 4, columns 1-5. So row 4, column 4 is S. So if the snake is moving up from row 5, column 4 (after moving right a few times), row 4, column 4 is S. So collision. So that apple may be harder to reach.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is row 1, column 1. That's in the upper left. The snake's body is in row 4, columns 1-5, and row 5, column 1. So row 5, column 1 is S, row 4, column 1 is S, etc. So moving left from current position (5,2) to (5,1) is S (body), which is collision, so can't go left. So that apple is probably not accessible soon.\n\nSo the closest apple is (6,3). So the best path is to move towards that. Between moving RIGHT then DOWN, or DOWN then RIGHT. Both are possible.\n\nBut the question is, which direction should we choose now. Since the current direction is RIGHT, and we can continue moving RIGHT (since it's allowed), and that's a safe move, and then next step can go down to get the apple. So perhaps moving RIGHT is the better choice here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving DOWN is better. Let's check the positions again. If we move RIGHT, the head goes to (5,3). The body is now (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2). So (5,3) is safe. Then, next move direction can be DOWN. (5,3) → (6,3) (apple). That's good.\n\nIf we move DOWN now, head is (6,2). Then next direction RIGHT: (6,2) → (6,3) (apple). That's also good.\n\nSo both directions are valid. But perhaps the problem expects us to choose the direction that leads to the apple in the next step. Since moving RIGHT now allows the next step to reach the apple, and moving DOWN also allows that, but perhaps there's no better option.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's any other possible collision. For example, if we move RIGHT, the next position is (5,3). Are there any body parts there? The body parts after moving would be (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2). So (5,3) is not a body part, so safe.\n\nIf we move DOWN, (6,2) is not a body part (body parts are (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2)), so (6,2) is safe.\n\nSo both directions are safe. The question is, which direction is better. Since the problem is to eat as many apples as possible, either direction is acceptable. But perhaps the answer is RIGHT, since the current direction is RIGHT, and changing direction may not be needed. Alternatively, maybe DOWN is better. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better path. Let's check the snake's body structure. The snake's body is in row 4 (columns 1-5) and row 5 (column 1). So the snake is shaped like a \"corner\": from (4,5) down to (4,1), then right to (5,1), then right to (5,2) (head). So the snake is moving right, and its body is to the left and up.\n\nIf the snake continues moving right (current direction), it will move into (5,3), (5,4), etc. There's no immediate danger. Moving down would take it into row 6, which is currently empty except for the apple at (6,3).\n\nIn the example given in the problem statement, when the snake moves and eats an apple, the body grows (so the tail doesn't disappear). So when the head moves into an apple, the tail remains, and the body length increases by 1.\n\nIn our current scenario, the next apple is at (6,3). So whichever direction we choose now, if the next move is towards that apple, we can eat it. So perhaps either direction is acceptable. But the problem requires us to choose one of the four directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN), and LEFT is invalid (reverse), UP is invalid (body collision). So the options are RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nSince the current direction is RIGHT, and the snake can continue moving in that direction without collision, and that's a valid choice, perhaps the answer is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#SSSSS #\n#SH    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (5, 2) (row 5, column 2). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). \n\n### Analysis of possible moves:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (5, 2) would take the head to (4, 2). However, row 4 has 'SSSSS', meaning (4, 2) is part of the snake's body. This would cause a self-collision. **UP is invalid**.\n   \n2. **LEFT**: Reversing direction (current direction is RIGHT) is not allowed. **LEFT is invalid**.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5, 2) takes the head to (5, 3). This position is empty (no walls or snake body). The snake can safely move here. After moving, the tail (previously at (4, 5)) will shift, and the body updates to (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2) (all safe). No apple is eaten here, but this direction keeps the snake moving away from its body and toward the apple at (6, 3) (reachable in the next move by turning DOWN).\n\n4. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5, 2) takes the head to (6, 2). This position is empty (no walls or snake body). The snake can safely move here. After moving, the tail (previously at (4, 5)) shifts, and the body updates to (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2) (all safe). No apple is eaten here, but this direction also allows reaching the apple at (6, 3) in the next move by turning RIGHT.\n\n### Best choice:\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN are safe, but continuing in the current direction (RIGHT) avoids unnecessary turns and keeps the snake on a path toward the apple at (6, 3) (reachable in the next move by turning DOWN). \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#SSSS  #\n#SSH   #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT, and the current epoch is 16. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. Let's locate the head first. Looking at the board, the 5th row (since rows are 0-indexed or 1-indexed? Let's check the example given. The example has 8 lines, so rows 0 to 7. Let's count:\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: # A  A #\nRow 2: #      #\nRow 3: #      #\nRow 4: #SSSS  #\nRow 5: #SSH   #\nRow 6: #   A  #\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo row 5 (the sixth line) has \"SSH   \", so columns 2 is S, column 3 is S, column 4 is H. So the head (H) is at position (5,4) (row 5, column 4). The current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is moving towards the right (higher column numbers). \n\nNow, let's track the snake's body to understand its length and path. Let's look at row 4: \"#SSSS  #\". That's columns 1-4: S, S, S, S. Then row 5 has \"SSH   \", which is columns 1: S, column 2: S, column 3: S, column 4: H. So the body is connected. Let's reconstruct the snake's path. The head is at (5,4). The previous position (since direction is RIGHT, the head moved from (5,3) to (5,4) in the last step). (5,3) is S, which is part of the body. Then (5,2) is S, (5,1) is S. Then row 4, column 4 is S (row 4, column 4). So (4,4) is S. Then (4,3) is S, (4,2) is S, (4,1) is S. So the snake's body is:\n\nHead at (5,4). Then the body goes left along row 5 to (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). Then down to row 4, column 1, 2, 3, 4. So the snake's body is a line going from (4,1) to (4,4) (row 4, columns 1-4), then up to row 5, columns 1-3, then the head at (5,4). So the snake's length: let's count the number of S and H. H is 1, S's: row 5 has 3 S (columns 1-3), row 4 has 4 S (columns 1-4). Total S: 3 +4 =7, plus H (1) makes length 8.\n\nNow, the snake is moving RIGHT. The next move would be in the current direction (RIGHT) unless we change direction. But the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is RIGHT, so possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT. Can't go LEFT (reverse of RIGHT).\n\nWe need to choose a direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) but can't reverse. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check where the head would move next for each possible direction:\n\nCurrent head position: (5,4). \n\nIf direction is RIGHT: next position is (5,5). Let's check what's there. The row 5 is \"#SSH   #\", so column 5 is ' ' (empty). So (5,5) is empty. Is there a wall? The walls are the borders, so columns 0 and 7 are walls. So (5,5) is safe (column 5 is within 1-6, since the board is 8x8, columns 0-7, with 0 and 7 being walls). So (5,5) is safe.\n\nIf direction is UP: moving up from row 5 to row 4. The next position is (4,4). What's in row 4, column 4? The row 4 is \"#SSSS  #\", so column 4 is S (body part). So moving UP would take the head to (4,4), which is part of the snake's body. That's a collision, game over. So UP is invalid.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: moving down from row 5 to row 6. Next position is (6,4). Let's check row 6: \"#   A  #\". Columns 0 is #, 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is ' ', 4 is 'A', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is #. So (6,4) is an apple (A). So moving DOWN would take the head to (6,4), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple increases the score and the snake grows.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: reverse of RIGHT, which is not allowed. So can't choose LEFT.\n\nSo possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN. But UP leads to collision (body), so invalid. So options are RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nLet's evaluate RIGHT: next position (5,5) is empty. The snake moves there. Since it's empty, the tail (the end of the snake) would move. The snake's length is 8. When moving, the head moves to new position, and if no apple is eaten, the tail (last segment) is removed. So after moving RIGHT to (5,5), the new head is (5,5). The body would be the previous positions except the tail. The current body is (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4). The tail is the last part. Wait, the snake's movement: when moving, the head moves forward, and each body segment follows the previous one. So the tail is the last segment. Let's track the order. The head is at (5,4), then the next segment is (5,3), then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So the tail is (4,4). When moving right to (5,5), the new head is (5,5). The body segments become (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). So the tail (4,4) is removed, and the new body is these positions. So (5,5) is safe, but no apple.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: head moves to (6,4), which is an apple (A). Eating the apple increases the score by 1. The snake grows, so the tail is not removed. So the new head is (6,4), and the body includes all previous segments. The body would now be (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Because when you eat an apple, the snake's length increases by 1, so the tail doesn't move. So the new body would have all the previous segments plus the new head. Wait, no: when the snake moves, normally, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the one in front. If it eats an apple, the tail stays (so the length increases by 1). So the movement for eating an apple: the head moves to (6,4) (the apple's position), and the body segments are (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So the new snake would have the head at (6,4), followed by (5,4), then (5,3), etc. So the body is now longer by 1. That's a good move because it gains a point and the snake grows, which is better.\n\nNow, are there any other considerations? Let's check if moving DOWN would cause a collision. The new head position is (6,4), which is an apple, not a wall (row 6 is within 0-7, column 4 is within 1-6, so no wall collision). Also, (6,4) is not part of the current body. The current body is in rows 4 and 5, columns 1-4, and row 5 column 3. So (6,4) is not part of the body. So moving DOWN is safe and allows eating the apple.\n\nSo the best direction is DOWN.\n\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#SSSS  #\n#SSH   #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at row 5, column 4 (coordinates (5,4)). The body 'S' extends left along row 5 (columns 1-3) and down to row 4 (columns 1-4).\n\n2. **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Direction**:\n   - **UP**: Moving to (4,4) (row 4, column 4). This square is occupied by the snake's body ('S'), causing a collision. Invalid.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moving to (5,5) (row 5, column 5). This square is empty. Safe but no apple.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving to (6,4) (row 6, column 4). This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows without losing the tail. Safe and beneficial.\n\nDOWN is the best choice as it allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and avoid collisions.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, let's look at the current game board and the current direction. The current direction is DOWN, and the epoch is 17, which is way before 100, so the game isn't ending yet.\n\nFirst, let's parse the game board. The board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # A  A # → So positions (1,1) is A, (1,4) is A (since indexes start at 0, columns 1 and 4 in row 1)\nRow 2: #      # → empty, columns 1-6 are empty\nRow 3: #      # → same, empty\nRow 4: #SSS   # → columns 1,2,3 are S (since row 4, columns 1: S, 2:S, 3:S)\nRow 5: #SSS   # → columns 1,2,3 are S (row 5, columns 1:S, 2:S, 3:S)\nRow 6: #  HA  # → columns 2 is H (head), column 3 is A (apple), and column 4 is A (apple)? Wait, let's check. Row 6: characters are #, space, space, H, A, space, space, #. Wait, let's index each position (row, column) from 0. So row 6 has columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. Oh right, so H is at (6,3), and there's an A at (6,4). Also, in row 1, A's are at (1,1) and (1,4). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 1: columns 0: #, 1: A, 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: A, 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (1,1) and (1,4) are apples.\n\nThe snake's body is made of 'S's. Let's find all the S positions. Looking at row 4: #SSS   # → columns 1,2,3 are S. So (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Row 5: #SSS   # → (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). So the body is these positions. The head is H at (6,3).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake is moving DOWN. So the next position the head will move to is (6+1, 3) → (7,3). But row 7 is the bottom wall (row 0 and 7 are walls). So (7,3) is a wall. If the snake moves DOWN, it will hit the wall and the game ends. So moving DOWN is bad.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is DOWN, the reverse is UP. So the snake can't turn UP directly. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (but that's a wall). Wait, the rules say: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, no. The example says: reverse direction is like UP to DOWN or LEFT to RIGHT. So if current direction is DOWN, the reverse is UP. So the snake can't turn UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or keep moving DOWN (but that's a wall).\n\nSo the snake's current head is at (6,3). Let's list possible next moves:\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The next possible directions the player can input are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since UP is reverse and not allowed). Let's check each:\n\n1. DOWN: Next head position is (7,3). Row 7 is all '#', so (7,3) is a wall. Collision with wall → game ends. So bad.\n\n2. LEFT: Direction is LEFT. The head would move to (6, 3-1) = (6,2). What's at (6,2)? The current row 6 is #  HA  # → column 2 is ' ' (space). So (6,2) is empty. Now, check if that position is part of the snake's body. The snake's body is the S's. The S positions are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). (6,2) is not in those positions. So moving LEFT is safe. The new head would be (6,2). Then, the body would follow. Since the snake's length is the number of S's plus 1 (the head). Let's count the S's: row 4 has 3 S's, row 5 has 3 S's. So 6 S's. So the snake's length is 6 + 1 = 7. When moving, the tail (the last S) would be removed unless an apple is eaten. Wait, the example shows that when the snake eats an apple, it grows. So normally, when moving, the head moves, and the tail (the last segment) is removed. But if the head moves into an apple, then the tail isn't removed, so the snake grows by 1.\n\nIn this case, if the direction is LEFT, the new head is (6,2), which is empty. So the snake moves: the new head is (6,2), and the tail (the last S) is removed. Let's see the current body: the S's are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). The snake's body is a sequence. Since the snake is moving DOWN, the direction of the body segments would be such that the head is at (6,3), then the next segment (the first S) would be where the head was before moving. Let's think: the snake's movement. The head moves first, then each body segment follows the previous one. So, the current head is at (6,3). Before the current move (epoch 17), the head was at (5,3), and then moved down to (6,3) in the previous step. Because current direction is DOWN, so the previous position of the head would be (5,3). Then the body segments follow. So the S's are the previous positions of the head and body. Let's reconstruct the snake's body path.\n\nAssuming that the snake was moving down, let's track the positions:\n\nCurrent head at (6,3). Previous position (epoch 16) would have been (5,3). Then, before that (epoch 15), (4,3). Epoch 14: (3,3), epoch 13: (2,3), epoch 12: (1,3), etc. But the S's are in row 4 and 5, columns 1-3. Hmm, maybe the snake is coiled. Let's count the number of S's. There are 6 S's (row 4: 3, row 5:3). So the snake's body is 6 segments. The head is 1, so total length 7.\n\nWhen moving, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So, if the head moves LEFT to (6,2), then the next segment (the one that was at (6,3)) becomes S, then the next segment moves to where the previous S was, etc. The tail (the last S) would be removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nBut in this case, moving LEFT to (6,2) is safe (no collision with body or wall).\n\n3. RIGHT: Direction is RIGHT. The head would move to (6, 3+1) = (6,4). What's at (6,4)? Looking at row 6: #  HA  # → column 4 is 'A'. Oh! There's an apple there. So if the snake moves RIGHT, the head moves to (6,4), which is an apple. So the snake eats the apple, score increases by 1, and the snake grows by 1 (so the tail isn't removed). Now, check if (6,4) is a valid position. The walls are at column 0 and 7, row 0 and 7. (6,4) is within the board (row 6 is between 1-6, column 4 between 1-6). So no wall collision. Now, check if (6,4) is part of the snake's body. The current body S's are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). (6,4) is not in these positions. So moving RIGHT would result in eating the apple, which is good. That's a better option than moving LEFT (since eating apple increases score and length).\n\nSo possible directions:\n\n- DOWN: wall collision → game over. Bad.\n\n- LEFT: safe, no apple.\n\n- RIGHT: safe, eat apple. So that's the best option.\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The player can choose to turn RIGHT (since it's not the reverse direction; reverse of DOWN is UP). So turning RIGHT is allowed. So the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS   #\n#  HA  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Current Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (6,3) (row 6, column 3). The body ('S') occupies positions (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). The current direction is DOWN.\n\n2. **Possible Moves**: The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is the reverse of DOWN, so UP is invalid). Valid directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Direction**:\n   - **DOWN**: The head would move to (7,3), which is a wall (row 7 is a wall). Colliding with the wall ends the game. This is invalid.\n   - **LEFT**: The head would move to (6,2), an empty space. No collision with walls or the snake's body. This is safe but does not eat an apple.\n   - **RIGHT**: The head would move to (6,4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. (6,4) is within the board and not part of the snake's body, so no collision. This is safe and beneficial.\n\nThe best move is to turn RIGHT to eat the apple and avoid game-ending collisions.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#'. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # A  A # → So positions (1,1) is A, (1,4) is A (since indexes start at 0, right? Let's confirm: columns 0 is #, 1 is A, 2 is space, 3 is space, 4 is A, 5 is space, 6 is #)\nRow 2: #      # → all spaces except walls\nRow 3: #     A# → columns 0 is #, 1-4 spaces, 5 is A, 6 is #\nRow 4: #SSS   # → columns 1-3 are S (since (4,1)=S, (4,2)=S, (4,3)=S)\nRow 5: #SSS   # → (5,1)=S, (5,2)=S, (5,3)=S\nRow 6: #  SH  # → columns 2 is space, 3 is S, 4 is H, 5 is space → (6,3)=S, (6,4)=H\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake's head is at (6,4). Since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move without changing direction would be to (6,5). Let's check if that's possible.\n\nFirst, the snake's body: let's list all the S positions. From row 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3); row 5: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3); row 6: (6,3). So the body is a contiguous block from (4,1) to (5,3), and (6,3). The head is at (6,4). So the snake's body positions are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3). The head is (6,4). \n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The next head position if moving RIGHT is (6,5). Let's check if that's a wall or body. (6,5) is in row 6, column 5. The row 6 is \"#  SH  #\", so column 5 is a space. So (6,5) is empty. So moving RIGHT is possible here. But are there any apples there? Let's check apples on the board. The apples are in row 1: (1,1), (1,4); row 3: (3,5). So (6,5) is not an apple. So moving RIGHT would just move the head there, and the body would shift. The snake's length is the number of S plus 1 (the head). Let's count S: row 4 has 3 S, row 5 has 3 S, row 6 has 1 S → 3+3+1=7 S, so length 8. When moving, the tail (the last S) would be removed unless an apple is eaten. Since moving RIGHT doesn't hit an apple, the tail (probably the first S in the sequence) would be removed. But maybe the body's order is important. Let's think about the snake's movement: the head moves forward, each body segment follows the previous one. So the body is a sequence from head to tail. Let's figure out the snake's body path.\n\nThe head is at (6,4). The previous position (since direction is RIGHT, the head came from the left). So the body segment adjacent to the head would be (6,3) (which is S). Then the next body segment would be (5,3) (row 5, column 3), then (5,2), (5,1), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). Let me see: the direction was RIGHT, so the head was moving right. So the head was at (6,3) before, then moved to (6,4). Wait, no. Current direction is RIGHT, so the snake is moving right. So the head is at (6,4), and the body is behind it. So the body segments are in the path leading up to the head. Let's reconstruct the snake's path. The snake's head is (6,4), moving RIGHT. The body is (6,3), then (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). Wait, maybe that's the order. Because if the snake is moving right, the head is the front. So the body segments follow. So the body is in the order: (6,3) (adjacent to head), then (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). So when the snake moves right, the head goes to (6,5), and each body segment moves to the position of the previous one. The tail (the last segment, which is (4,1)) would be removed if no apple is eaten. So after moving right, the new head is (6,5), the body segments become (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,3), (4,2). The tail (4,1) is removed.\n\nNow, what other directions can we choose? The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake can't reverse to LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since reversing is not allowed). So the possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Let's check each.\n\nOption 1: RIGHT. Next head position (6,5). Check if that's a wall or body. (6,5) is in row 6, column 5. The row 6 is \"#  SH  #\", columns 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is space, 3 is S, 4 is H, 5 is space, 6 is #. So (6,5) is space. So no collision. So that's safe.\n\nOption 2: UP. Current direction is RIGHT. Turning UP is allowed (since it's not reversing). The next head position would be (5,4). Let's check (5,4). The row 5 is \"#SSS   #\". So row 5, column 4 is space (since columns 1-3 are S, 4-6 are space). So (5,4) is space. No collision with body? Let's check if (5,4) is a body part. The current body parts are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3). So (5,4) is not a body part. So moving UP to (5,4) is safe. Any apple there? Let's check apples. Apples are at (1,1), (1,4), (3,5). (5,4) is not an apple. So moving UP would be safe but no apple eaten.\n\nOption 3: DOWN. Current direction is RIGHT. Turning DOWN is allowed. Next head position is (7,4). But row 7 is the bottom wall (########). So (7,4) is a wall. So moving DOWN would hit the wall, causing a collision. So that's invalid. So DOWN is not possible.\n\nSo possible directions are RIGHT and UP. Let's check if moving RIGHT leads to any future issues. Let's see the next position (6,5). Then, what's around there. The next move after that, if direction remains RIGHT, head would go to (6,6), which is a wall (since row 6, column 6 is #). So that's a problem. So moving RIGHT now would lead to (6,5), then next move RIGHT would hit the wall. But maybe we can change direction then. But let's think about apples. Are there apples that we can reach?\n\nCurrent apples are at (1,1), (1,4), (3,5). Let's see where the snake is. The head is at (6,4). The apple at (3,5) is in row 3, column 5. To reach that, the snake would need to move up. Let's see the path. If current direction is RIGHT, moving RIGHT takes us to (6,5). Then, maybe turn UP. Let's check (6,5) → (5,5) if direction is UP. (5,5) is in row 5, which is \"#SSS   #\", so column 5 is space. So (5,5) is safe. Then (4,5), (3,5) which is the apple. So (3,5) is the apple. So if the snake moves RIGHT, then UP, then UP, then UP, it can reach (3,5) and eat that apple.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake turns UP now, moving to (5,4). Then, perhaps moving UP again to (4,4). (4,4) is in row 4, which is \"#SSS   #\", so column 4 is space. Then (3,4), (3,5) (apple). So that's another path. Let's check (5,4) → (4,4) → (3,4) → (3,5). That's 3 moves. So either path could reach the apple at (3,5).\n\nBut let's check the current positions. The snake's body is in (4,1-3), (5,1-3), (6,3). So the area around the head (6,4) is:\n\nUp: (5,4) (space)\nRight: (6,5) (space)\nDown: (7,4) (wall)\nLeft: (6,3) (body, since (6,3) is S). So moving LEFT is not allowed (current direction is RIGHT, reversing, and also (6,3) is body, so collision).\n\nSo the options are UP or RIGHT. Let's see which direction is better. Let's check if moving UP now would lead to a possible collision. After moving UP to (5,4), the new body would be (6,4) (old head), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) (since length is 8, when no apple is eaten, the tail (4,1) is removed). Wait, no. When the snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each body segment follows the previous one, so the tail (last segment) is removed unless an apple is eaten. So current snake has 7 body segments (S) and 1 head (H), total length 8. So when moving, if no apple is eaten, the length remains 8. So the new body would consist of the old head (6,4) and the first 6 body segments (since 7 body segments + head = 8; moving, new head is (5,4), then body is (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,3), (4,2) (since 7 body segments). The tail (4,1) is removed. So (5,4) is safe.\n\nIf moving RIGHT to (6,5), the new body would be (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,3), (4,2), and the tail (4,1) is removed. So (6,5) is safe.\n\nNow, the apple at (3,5) is a good target. Let's see the path from (6,4) to (3,5). The current head is (6,4). (3,5) is 3 rows up (6→5→4→3) and 1 column right (4→5). So moving up three times and right once. But the snake's current direction is RIGHT. So perhaps moving RIGHT first to (6,5) (column 5), then up. (6,5) → (5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5). That's three moves up. Let's check those positions:\n\n(5,5) is in row 5, column 5. Row 5 is \"#SSS   #\", so columns 4-6 are spaces. So (5,5) is space. (4,5) in row 4, column 5: row 4 is \"#SSS   #\", columns 4-6 are spaces. (3,5) is the apple. So that's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first to (5,4), then right to (5,5), then up to (4,5), then up to (3,5). That's also possible.\n\nBut the key is to avoid collisions. Let's check if moving RIGHT now is safe. (6,5) is safe. Then, next move could be UP. Let's see if (6,5) → (5,5) is safe. (5,5) is space, and not part of the current body. So that's okay.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's body is in the lower left area (rows 4-6, columns 1-3). The head is at (6,4). So the area to the right (columns 5-6) and up (rows 5-3) are mostly empty. So moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\nSo the best direction here is to continue moving RIGHT, as it's safe and allows the snake to move towards the apple at (3,5) in the next steps. So the answer is RIGHT.\n\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#SSS   #\n#SSS   #\n#  SH  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\n- **Snake Head (H)**: Position (6,4) (row 6, column 4).\n- **Snake Body (S)**: Positions (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3).\n- **Apples (A)**: Positions (1,1), (1,4), (3,5).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT.\n- **Collision Rules**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., RIGHT → LEFT is invalid) and loses if it hits walls (`#`) or its own body.\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **RIGHT**: The snake moves to (6,5) (row 6, column 5).  \n   - (6,5) is a space (no wall or body collision).  \n   - Safe move; no apple here, but allows progression toward the apple at (3,5) in future steps.  \n\n2. **UP**: The snake moves to (5,4) (row 5, column 4).  \n   - (5,4) is a space (no collision).  \n   - Safe but does not directly progress toward the nearest apple (3,5).  \n\n3. **DOWN**: The snake moves to (7,4) (row 7, column 4).  \n   - (7,4) is a wall (`#`), causing an immediate collision. **Invalid**.  \n\n4. **LEFT**: Reverses the current direction (RIGHT → LEFT), which is invalid. **Invalid**.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is safe, avoids collisions, and positions the snake to approach the apple at (3,5) in subsequent moves. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # A  A # (so positions (1,1) is A, (1,4) is A)\nRow 2: #      # (empty)\nRow 3: #     A# (position (3,5) is A)\nRow 4: #SS    # (positions (4,1) and (4,2) are S)\nRow 5: #SSS   # (positions (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) are S)\nRow 6: #  SSH # (positions (6,3) is S, (6,4) is S, (6,5) is H)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at (6,5). The current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is moving to the right. Let's confirm the direction: moving RIGHT would take the head from (6,5) to (6,6). Let's check what's at (6,6). The row 6 is \"#  SSH #\", which is 8 characters. Let's index each position from 0 to 7 (since 8 columns). Let's list row 6:\n\nRow 6: index 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is 'S', 4 is 'S', 5 is 'H', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'\n\nSo (6,5) is H. Moving RIGHT (same row, column +1) would take it to (6,6), which is a space. That's safe. But wait, what's the snake's body? Let's list all the 'S' positions:\n\nRow 4: columns 1 and 2 → (4,1), (4,2)\nRow 5: columns 1,2,3 → (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\nRow 6: columns 3,4 → (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo the body segments are at (4,1), (4,2), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4). The head is at (6,5). The snake's current direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction. So possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since current is RIGHT, can't go LEFT).\n\nWait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, wait, the example says reversing direction is not allowed. So if current direction is RIGHT, the snake can't go LEFT (since that's reverse). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, the snake's next move: depending on the direction chosen, the head moves to a new position. Let's check each possible direction:\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse).\n\nLet's check each possible direction's next head position:\n\n1. RIGHT: next head is (6,6). Check if that's a wall or body. (6,6) is ' ' (from row 6: \"#  SSH #\", so column 6 is ' '). So safe. Is there an apple there? Let's check the board. Looking at row 6, column 6 is ' ', so no apple. So moving RIGHT here, the head moves to (6,6). The snake's body will follow. Since it's not eating an apple, the tail (the last segment) would move forward. Let's see the current body segments. The snake's body is a chain. The head is (6,5). The next segment is (6,4), then (6,3), then (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,2), (4,1). Wait, maybe I need to reconstruct the snake's body in order. Because in snake games, the body follows the head in a chain. Let's think: the snake's head is at (6,5). The body segments are the S's. Let's list all S and H positions and see the order.\n\nThe S's and H are:\n\n(6,5) H (head)\n(6,4) S (next)\n(6,3) S\n(5,3) S\n(5,2) S\n(5,1) S\n(4,2) S\n(4,1) S\n\nSo the snake's body is: H at (6,5) → (6,4) → (6,3) → (5,3) → (5,2) → (5,1) → (4,2) → (4,1). So the length is 8 (since 1 head + 7 S's). When moving, if the snake doesn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment, (4,1)) will be removed, and each segment moves to the position of the previous one. If it does eat an apple, the tail stays, and the snake grows.\n\nSo for each direction:\n\nCase 1: Move RIGHT → new head (6,6). Check collision: (6,6) is ' ', no body (since body is at (6,4), (6,3), etc.), no wall (row 6, column 6 is within 0-7, walls are at 0 and 7). So safe. No apple here, so tail (4,1) is removed. New body positions would be: (6,5) (old head becomes S), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,2). The new head is (6,6).\n\nCase 2: Move UP. Current direction is RIGHT, moving UP is allowed (not reverse). Moving UP would take the head from (6,5) to (5,5). Let's check (5,5). Row 5 is \"#SSS   #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (5,5) is ' ', no body. So (5,5) is safe. Any apple there? Looking at the board, row 5 has no A's. So moving UP here, head to (5,5), safe.\n\nCase 3: Move DOWN. Current direction is RIGHT, moving DOWN is allowed. The head is at (6,5). Moving DOWN would take it to (7,5). But row 7 is a wall (########). So (7,5) is a wall. Collision with wall, game over. So moving DOWN is invalid, would end the game. So that's bad.\n\nCase 4: Move LEFT. Current direction is RIGHT, moving LEFT is reverse direction, which is not allowed. So that's invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are RIGHT, UP. Now, need to check if moving RIGHT or UP leads to any apples, and avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's check the positions of apples. The current apples are in row 1 (columns 1 and 4), row 3 (column 5). Let's list all A positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,4) → positions (1,1) and (1,4)\nRow 3: (3,5) → position (3,5)\n\nSo apples at (1,1), (1,4), (3,5).\n\nNow, where are the possible next positions for the head in the next move (epoch 20) if we choose RIGHT or UP:\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: new head (6,6). Is there an apple there? (6,6) is ' ', so no. So snake moves, no apple eaten. Then, in the next epoch (epoch 20), the snake's head is (6,6). The body is now (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,2).\n\nIf we choose UP: new head (5,5). Check if (5,5) has an apple. (5,5) is ' ', no. So snake moves, no apple eaten.\n\nBut perhaps we should look further ahead. Let's think about the next possible moves to reach apples.\n\nThe snake's current head is (6,5). Let's think about the path to the apples.\n\nThe closest apples are (3,5) (row 3, column 5). Let's see: (3,5) is in row 3, column 5. The current head is (6,5). So to reach (3,5), the snake would need to move UP three times (from row 6 to row 5, then 4, then 3). Let's check the path.\n\nIf current direction is RIGHT, but if we turn UP, then we can start moving upwards. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head (6,5). If we move UP (direction UP), head goes to (5,5). Then, next direction could be UP again (since current direction is UP, can't go DOWN). Then, head moves to (4,5). Let's check (4,5): row 4 is \"#SS    #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1:S, 2:S, 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (4,5) is ' ', safe. Then, moving UP again (direction UP) to (3,5), which is the apple at (3,5). That would be good. So if we choose UP now, then next direction UP, then next direction UP, we can reach the apple at (3,5).\n\nAlternatively, if we move RIGHT now, head to (6,6). Then, next direction could be UP (since current direction would be RIGHT again? Wait, no. The direction the player inputs each epoch. So each epoch, the player chooses a direction (as long as it's not reverse of current direction).\n\nWait, current direction is RIGHT. So if in epoch 19, the player chooses UP, then the new direction becomes UP (since that's the direction input). Then, in epoch 20, the current direction is UP, so the snake moves in UP direction, and the player can choose directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) but not DOWN (reverse).\n\nSo if we choose UP in epoch 19, the next direction (epoch 20) is UP, moving to (5,5). Then in epoch 20, the player can choose UP again (direction UP) to move to (4,5). Then in epoch 21, direction UP again to (3,5), which has the apple. That's a good path.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT in epoch 19, the snake moves to (6,6). Then, in epoch 20, the current direction is RIGHT (since the input was RIGHT), so the player can choose directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). If the player wants to go up, they can choose UP in epoch 20, changing direction to UP, then move to (5,6). Let's check (5,6): row 5 is \"#SSS   #\", column 6 is ' ', safe. Then in epoch 21, direction UP again, moving to (4,6), which is ' ', then (3,6), which is row 3: \"#     A#\", column 6 is '#', which is a wall. Oh, (3,6) is column 6, row 3. The row 3 is \"#     A#\", which is 8 characters. So columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: '#'. So (3,6) is a wall, which is bad. So moving RIGHT first might lead to a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, if after moving RIGHT to (6,6), the player could choose LEFT (but no, because current direction would be RIGHT, so next direction can't be LEFT. So directions allowed would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT. So if in epoch 20, direction is UP, head moves to (5,6), which is safe, then epoch 21 direction UP to (4,6), safe, epoch 22 direction UP to (3,6) (wall, bad). So that path is not good.\n\nSo moving UP now (epoch 19) allows the snake to move towards the apple at (3,5) in the next steps. Let's check the path again:\n\nEpoch 19: direction UP → head (5,5). Body follows, tail (4,1) is removed. So new body is (6,5) (old head), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,2). So the snake's body is now from (5,5) (head) → (6,5) → (6,4) → (6,3) → (5,3) → (5,2) → (5,1) → (4,2).\n\nEpoch 20: direction UP (since current direction is now UP). Head moves to (4,5). Check (4,5): row 4 is \"#SS    #\", column 5 is ' ', safe. Body follows, tail (4,2) is removed. So new body is (5,5) (old head), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1).\n\nEpoch 21: direction UP again. Head moves to (3,5). Which is the apple at (3,5). So the snake eats the apple, grows by 1 (so tail doesn't get removed), score increases by 1. That's a good outcome.\n\nSo choosing UP now allows the snake to reach the apple in (3,5) in 3 steps. That's a good plan.\n\nWhat about the other apples? The apples at (1,1) and (1,4) are in row 1, which is higher up. To reach those, the snake would need to move up more, but (3,5) is closer. So (3,5) is the nearest apple.\n\nNow, let's check if moving UP now is possible (no collision). When moving UP from (6,5) to (5,5), (5,5) is ' ', no body. The body segments are (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,2), (4,1). (5,5) is not among them, so safe. So moving UP is safe.\n\nMoving RIGHT is also safe, but moving UP is better because it's a path towards an apple. So the best direction is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#SS    #\n#SSS   #\n#  SSH #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6,5) (row 6, column 5). The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,5), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'), causing a collision. This is invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6,6), which is empty (safe) but has no apple. This avoids collision but does not lead toward the nearest apple.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (5,5), which is empty (safe). This direction aligns the snake to move toward the nearest apple at (3,5) (row 3, column 5). Subsequent UP moves can reach this apple in 3 steps, allowing the snake to eat it and grow.  \n\nThe optimal choice is UP, as it directs the snake toward the nearest apple while avoiding collisions.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position and direction. \n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake can't reverse direction, so the snake can't go DOWN now. The possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's start by analyzing the game board.\n\nFirst, let's map out the board. The board is 8x8, with '#' as walls. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # A  A # (positions (1,1)=A, (1,4)=A)\nRow 2: #      # (empty)\nRow 3: #     A# (position (3,5)=A)\nRow 4: #S     # (position (4,1)=S)\nRow 5: #SSS H # (positions (5,1)=S, (5,2)=S, (5,3)=S, (5,5)=H)\nRow 6: #  SSS # (positions (6,2)=S, (6,3)=S, (6,4)=S)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at (5,5). Let's confirm the coordinates: rows are 0-7, columns 0-7 (since each row is 8 characters). So (row, column) for H is (5,5).\n\nThe current direction is UP, so the snake is moving up. Let's see where the head would go next if we continue UP. Moving UP from (5,5) would take it to (4,5). Let's check what's there. Row 4 is \"#S     #\", so column 5 is empty (since row 4 has S at column 1, others are spaces). So (4,5) is a space. That's safe. But are there any apples there? Let's check. The apples are at (1,1), (1,4), (3,5). (4,5) is empty, so no apple. So moving UP would just move the head to (4,5), and the body would follow. The snake's body is S's. Let's track the body segments. The snake's body is a chain. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\nRow 4: (4,1)\nRow 6: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\nSo the body is S's in those positions. The head is at (5,5). The snake's length is 1 (head) plus the number of S's. Let's count the S's: 5,1;5,2;5,3;4,1;6,2;6,3;6,4. That's 7 S's. So total length is 8 (since H is 1, S's 7). \n\nNow, possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Can't go DOWN (reverse of UP). Let's check each direction.\n\nFirst, if we choose UP: the next head position is (4,5). Check if that's a wall or body. (4,5) is row 4, column 5. Row 4 is \"#S     #\", which is columns 0: #, 1:S, 2: , 3: , 4: , 5: , 6: , 7: #. So (4,5) is a space. No collision. Safe. Then, after moving, the head is at (4,5), and the body moves. The previous head (5,5) becomes S. The next body segments would follow. But we need to check if there's an apple here. (4,5) is not an apple, so the snake doesn't grow. \n\nIf we choose LEFT: direction is LEFT. The head is at (5,5). Moving LEFT would take it to (5,4). Let's check (5,4). Row 5 is \"#SSS H #\", which is columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4: (space), 5:H, 6: (space), 7: #. So (5,4) is a space. Safe. Is there an apple there? The apples are at (1,1), (1,4), (3,5). (5,4) is not an apple. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: direction is RIGHT. The head is at (5,5). Moving RIGHT would take it to (5,6). Check (5,6). Row 5: \"#SSS H #\", so column 6 is a space (since 5,5 is H, 5,6 is next). (5,6) is a space. Check walls: column 7 is #, so (5,6) is within the board (columns 0-7). So (5,6) is safe. No apple there. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nBut we need to see which direction leads to an apple. Let's look for apples. The apples are at (1,1), (1,4), (3,5). Let's see the positions of the apples and the snake's path.\n\nThe current head is at (5,5). The direction is UP. Let's see where the snake can reach apples.\n\nThe apple at (3,5) is in row 3, column 5. If the snake continues moving UP, from (5,5) to (4,5) (next step), then next step (3,5) (since direction is UP). So if we keep moving UP, the next two steps would be (4,5) then (3,5), which is the apple. So if we choose UP, then in the next move (epoch 21), the head is at (4,5). Then, in epoch 22, if direction remains UP, the head moves to (3,5), which is the apple. So eating that apple would increase the score.\n\nAlternatively, if we change direction now. Let's see: if the current direction is UP, and we choose UP again, the next position is (4,5). Then, if we continue UP, (3,5) (apple). So that's a good path.\n\nOther apples: (1,1) is in row 1, column 1. The snake's current position is (5,5). To reach (1,1), the snake would need to move left and up a lot, but there's a lot of body in row 5,4 (S at 5,1,5,2,5,3), row 4,1 (S), row 6,2-4 (S). So moving left from (5,5) to (5,4) is safe, but further left to (5,3) is S (since row 5,3 is S). So if we go left from (5,5) to (5,4), then next direction can't be right (reverse). So next direction could be up, down, or left. But (5,3) is S, so moving left again would hit the body. So left direction might not be good.\n\nThe apple at (1,4) is row 1, column 4. To reach that, the snake would need to move up. From (5,5) up to (4,5), (3,5) (apple), then (2,5), (1,5), then left to (1,4). But (1,4) is an apple. But (3,5) is an apple that's closer. So (3,5) is the nearest apple.\n\nSo the best direction is to keep moving UP towards that apple. Because if we go UP, next step (4,5), then next step (3,5) (apple), which would be eaten. So the direction should be UP.\n\nLet's confirm possible collisions. If we choose UP, the next head position is (4,5). Check if (4,5) is a body part. The body parts are (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,5) is not among them. So safe. So moving UP is safe and leads towards the apple. So the answer is UP.\n\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#SSS H #\n#  SSS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game board, snake position, and possible moves. The snake's head (H) is at (row 5, column 5), and the current direction is UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN). The snake’s body (S) occupies positions: (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). Apples (A) are at (1,1), (1,4), and (3,5).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (5,5) takes the head to (4,5). This position is empty (no walls or body collisions). Continuing UP from (4,5) would next reach (3,5), which contains an apple. This path safely leads toward an apple.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,5) takes the head to (5,4). This position is empty, but further left would risk collision with the snake’s body (e.g., (5,3) is S). No immediate apple in this direction.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5,5) takes the head to (5,6). This position is empty, but no apples are nearby, and this direction does not lead toward the closest apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe safest and most optimal direction is UP, as it leads the snake directly toward the nearest apple at (3,5) without risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#'. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # A  A # (positions 1,2 and 1,5 are apples)\nRow 2: #      # (empty)\nRow 3: #     A# (position 3,5 is an apple)\nRow 4: #    H # (head 'H' at position 4,4)\nRow 5: #SSS S # (body 'S's at positions 5,1; 5,2; 5,3; 5,5)\nRow 6: #  SSS # (body 'S's at positions 6,2; 6,3; 6,4)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. The snake's head is at (4,4) (assuming rows are 0-7, columns 0-7, with row 0 top). Since current direction is UP, the next move would be to row 3, column 4 (since moving up decreases the row number). Let's check where that position is.\n\nRow 3 is \"#     A#\". So row 3, column 4 is a space (empty). Let's confirm: row 3, columns 0 is '#', 1-4 are spaces, column 5 is 'A', column 6 is '#'. So (3,4) is empty. So if we keep moving UP, the head moves to (3,4). Now, we need to check if that's a valid move (no collision with walls or self).\n\nWait, the walls are around the edges. The head is at (4,4). Moving up to (3,4): row 3 is within 0-7 (since rows 0 and 7 are walls, but row 3 is not a wall). So no wall collision. Now, check if (3,4) is part of the snake's body. Let's list all the 'S' positions.\n\nRow 5: positions 1,2,3,5 (columns 1,2,3,5)\nRow 6: positions 2,3,4 (columns 2,3,4)\nSo (3,4) is not in any of these rows (rows 5 and 6). So (3,4) is safe. So moving UP would be possible. But maybe there's a better direction.\n\nWait, but the player can choose to change direction, as long as it's not reversing. The current direction is UP. The snake can't reverse to DOWN. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or keep UP.\n\nLet's check possible directions:\n\nCurrent direction is UP. Possible next directions are UP (same), LEFT, RIGHT. Can't go DOWN (reverse).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. UP: Next head position is (3,4). What's there? As above, (3,4) is empty. So the snake moves up. The body will follow. Since the snake's length: let's count the 'S's and 'H' to find the current length. H is 1, S's: row 5 has 4 S's (columns 1,2,3,5), row 6 has 3 S's (columns 2,3,4). So total S's: 4+3=7. So current length is 1 (H) +7 (S) =8. When moving, the tail (last S) would be removed unless an apple is eaten. Since (3,4) is not an apple, the snake moves, and the tail (the last S) is removed. So the new body would be the previous positions except the last.\n\nBut maybe there's an apple nearby. Let's see the apples. Apples are at row 1, columns 2 and 5; row 3, column 5.\n\nThe head is at (4,4). Let's see adjacent positions:\n\nUP: (3,4) → empty.\nLEFT: (4,3). Let's check row 4: \"#    H #\". Columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: '#'. So (4,3) is empty. So moving LEFT would take the head to (4,3). Is that safe? Check if (4,3) is a body part. The body is in row 5 (columns 1,2,3,5) and row 6 (columns 2,3,4). So (4,3) is not in any of those, so safe.\n\nRIGHT: (4,5). Let's check row 4, column 5. Row 4 is \"#    H #\", column 5 is ' ' (since H is at 4,4). So (4,5) is empty. So moving RIGHT would take head to (4,5). Check if that's a body part. (4,5) is not in row 5 or 6's S positions. So safe.\n\nDOWN: Not allowed (reverse of UP).\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's see where the apples are. The apples are at (1,2), (1,5), (3,5).\n\nThe head is at (4,4). Let's see the distance to apples. Let's think about the next moves. If we move UP to (3,4), the next position is (3,4). Then, from there, possible directions. The apple at (3,5) is to the right (column 5). So if the head is at (3,4), moving RIGHT would take it to (3,5), which is an apple. That's a good path. So moving UP now would allow reaching that apple next step.\n\nAlternatively, if we move RIGHT now (from (4,4) to (4,5)), then the head is at (4,5). Then, next possible directions (current direction would be RIGHT). The apple at (3,5) is up from (4,5). So moving UP from (4,5) would reach (3,5) (apple). That's also a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,3). Then, the next direction could be UP, but (3,3) would be the next position, which is empty, and perhaps not near any apples.\n\nSo which direction is better? Let's check the current positions. Let's map all positions:\n\nSnake's body positions (S):\n\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,5)\n\nRow 6: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo the body is mostly in rows 5 and 6, columns 1-4 and 5. The head is at (4,4). The snake's body is behind it (since it's moving UP, the body would be in the direction it came from). Let's think about the snake's path. Since the current direction is UP, the previous move was from (5,4) to (4,4). Wait, maybe. Because when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and the body follows. So the previous position of the head would be where the next part of the body is. Let's see: the head is at (4,4). The body in row 5: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,5). Row 6 has (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). Maybe the snake's body is arranged in a way that the next segment after the head is (5,4) (if the snake was moving up from (5,4) to (4,4)), but (5,4) is not an S in row 5. Row 5 is \"#SSS S #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: '#'. So (5,4) is empty. So perhaps the snake's body is in a different configuration. Maybe the snake's body is not directly behind the head. For example, the head is at (4,4), and the body is in row 5 and 6, perhaps the snake has been moving in a different path before.\n\nIn any case, the main thing is to avoid collision. Let's check the possible next moves:\n\nOption 1: UP → (3,4). Is (3,4) safe? Yes, as it's not a wall (row 3 is within 0-7, column 4 is within 0-6, since walls are at 0 and 6). So (3,4) is inside the board. And (3,4) is not an S. So safe.\n\nOption 2: LEFT → (4,3). Check if (4,3) is S. The S's are in row 5 (columns 1-3,5) and row 6 (columns 2-4). (4,3) is row 4, column 3. No S there. Safe.\n\nOption 3: RIGHT → (4,5). Check (4,5). Row 4, column 5. The S's in row 5, column 5 is (5,5), but (4,5) is row 4, which is empty. So (4,5) is safe.\n\nNow, which of these directions leads towards an apple?\n\nThe apple at (3,5) is in row 3, column 5. Let's see the positions:\n\nIf we move UP to (3,4), then the next move (if direction is RIGHT) would take us to (3,5), which is the apple. That's a good move. Because then we can eat that apple next step.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (4,5), then next move UP would take us to (3,5), which is the apple. That's also a good path.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,3) would take us away from the apples (since apples are at (1,2), (1,5), (3,5)). So (4,3) is further from those apples.\n\nSo between UP and RIGHT, which is better? Let's see if moving UP now would cause any collision in the next steps. Let's imagine moving UP to (3,4). Then, the next direction could be RIGHT (since current direction would be UP, next direction can be RIGHT, UP, or LEFT, but not DOWN). So moving RIGHT from (3,4) would reach (3,5) (apple). That's good.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (4,5). Then, next direction can be UP (since current direction would be RIGHT, can't go LEFT). So moving UP from (4,5) would reach (3,5) (apple). That's also good.\n\nBut let's check if moving UP now is possible. The current direction is UP, so moving UP is allowed. Let's confirm that (3,4) is not a body part. The body parts are in rows 5 and 6. So (3,4) is row 3, which is not in 5 or 6. So no collision. So moving UP is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (4,5) is also safe. So which direction is better? Let's check if there are any obstacles. Let's look at the body positions again. Suppose the snake moves UP to (3,4). Then, the new body positions would be the previous positions except the tail. The current body is 7 S's. The length is 8 (H +7 S). When moving without eating an apple, the snake's length remains the same, so the tail (last S) is removed. So the new body would be the previous positions except the last one. But since I don't know the exact order of the body segments, perhaps it's not critical here. The main thing is that the next position is safe.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the wall. If the snake moves UP, row 3 is safe. If it moves RIGHT, column 5 is okay (since the right wall is column 6, so column 5 is safe).\n\nSo both UP and RIGHT are possible. But let's see which one gets us to the apple faster. If we move UP to (3,4), then next move RIGHT to (3,5) (apple). That's two steps. If we move RIGHT to (4,5), next move UP to (3,5) (apple). Also two steps. So same number of steps.\n\nBut perhaps there's another factor. Let's check if moving UP would lead to a position where the next move is blocked. For example, after moving UP to (3,4), the next direction could be RIGHT. (3,4) to (3,5) is the apple, which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (4,5), then UP to (3,5) (apple). That's also safe.\n\nHmm. So which direction to choose? The problem says the snake starts moving in UP direction. The current direction is UP. The player can choose to continue in UP, or turn LEFT\/RIGHT (but not reverse).\n\nIn the example given, when the direction was DOWN, the head moved down and ate an apple. So perhaps the best choice here is to move towards the nearest apple. The apple at (3,5) is the closest. Let's calculate the distance from the head (4,4) to (3,5): it's 1 step up and 1 step right (Manhattan distance 2). So moving UP then RIGHT, or RIGHT then UP, both take two steps.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,5) is in row 1, column 5. Distance from (4,4) is 3 up and 1 right (Manhattan 4). The apple at (1,2) is row 1, column 2: distance 3 up and 2 left (Manhattan 5). So (3,5) is the closest.\n\nSo the best path is to reach (3,5) asap. So either direction UP or RIGHT could work. Let's see which direction allows that.\n\nIf current direction is UP, and we choose to go UP, then next position is (3,4). Then, we can turn RIGHT (since direction was UP, can turn RIGHT) to (3,5) (apple). That's good.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT now, then the new direction is RIGHT. Then, next move can be UP (since can't reverse to LEFT). So from (4,5), moving UP to (3,5) (apple). That's also good.\n\nBut let's check if moving RIGHT now would cause any collision. The head is at (4,4). Moving RIGHT to (4,5). Is (4,5) part of the body? The body in row 5, column 5 is (5,5), which is row 5, column 5. (4,5) is row 4, column 5, which is empty, so safe.\n\nSo both directions are safe. But which is better? Maybe the problem expects us to choose the direction that allows eating the apple in the next step. Let's see:\n\nIf we move UP now, then the next position is (3,4). Then, the next move direction could be RIGHT, leading to (3,5) (apple). So that's two steps.\n\nIf we move RIGHT now, the next position is (4,5). Then, next move direction UP leads to (3,5) (apple). Also two steps.\n\nSo either direction is acceptable. But perhaps the current direction is UP, so continuing UP is better. Let's confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a collision risk if we choose a different direction. Let's check the body positions again. The body is in row 5 (columns 1,2,3,5) and row 6 (columns 2,3,4). Let's imagine the snake's body structure. Maybe the snake is moving upwards, so the body is behind. For example, the head is at (4,4), the next segment could be (5,4), but (5,4) is empty. So perhaps the snake has a more complex path.\n\nIn any case, both directions (UP and RIGHT) are safe. But the question is which direction to choose. Since the current direction is UP, and the apple at (3,5) is to the right of the UP direction, perhaps turning RIGHT now would allow reaching the apple faster. Wait, no. Because moving UP first brings us closer to row 3, where the apple is. Let's think in terms of coordinates:\n\nHead at (4,4). Apple at (3,5). So (3,5) is (row-1, column+1) from head. So moving UP (row-1) then RIGHT (column+1) would reach it. Alternatively, moving RIGHT (column+1) then UP (row-1).\n\nEither way, two steps. So both directions are possible. But perhaps the best answer here is to choose UP, as the current direction is UP, and changing direction might not be necessary. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better option.\n\nWait, let's check the current game board again. The snake's body in row 5 is \"#SSS S #\", which is columns 1,2,3,5. Row 6 is \"#  SSS #\", columns 2,3,4. So the body is in a sort of L-shape. The head is at (4,4). If the snake moves UP to (3,4), then the new body positions would be the previous head (4,4) becomes S, and the tail (the last S) is removed. The tail is probably the last S in the sequence. For example, if the body was (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,5) — but I'm not sure. However, regardless of the tail, moving UP to (3,4) is safe.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the game ends after epoch 100, but current epoch is 21, so there's plenty of time. So the priority is to eat apples. The closest apple is (3,5). So moving towards that.\n\nSo, if I choose UP, the next position is (3,4). Then, the next move can be RIGHT to (3,5) (apple). That would be a good move. So the answer is UP.\n\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#    H #\n#SSS S #\n#  SSS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Game Board Overview:\n- **Walls**: Edge rows (0 and 7) and columns (0 and 6) are walls (`#`).\n- **Snake Head (H)**: Positioned at (4, 4) (row 4, column 4).\n- **Snake Body (S)**: Located in row 5 (columns 1, 2, 3, 5) and row 6 (columns 2, 3, 4).\n- **Apples (A)**: At (1, 2), (1, 5), and (3, 5).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake is moving upward).\n- **Collision Rules**: The snake loses if it hits walls or its own body.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Possible Directions**: Since the current direction is UP, the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Valid directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n2. **Apple Proximity**: The closest apple is at (3, 5) (row 3, column 5), with a Manhattan distance of 2 from the head (4, 4).\n3. **Safety Checks**:\n   - **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (3, 4). This position is within the board (not a wall) and not occupied by the snake’s body (body segments are in rows 5 and 6). Safe.\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (4, 3). This position is empty and not part of the body. Safe but moves away from the nearest apple.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (4, 5). This position is empty and not part of the body. Safe but requires an additional upward move to reach the nearest apple.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nMoving UP to (3, 4) keeps the snake aligned with the nearest apple at (3, 5). From (3, 4), the snake can then turn RIGHT to reach (3, 5) (the apple) in the next move. This path prioritizes eating the closest apple while avoiding collisions.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#    HA#\n#    S #\n# SS S #\n#  SSS #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the current epoch is 22. The snake can't reverse direction, so since it's moving UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. The possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse).\n\nFirst, let's locate the snake's head (H). Looking at the board, the 4th row (since rows are 0-indexed or 1-indexed? Let's check. The first line is ########, which is the top. Let's list rows from top to bottom as rows 0 to 7. So row 0 is ########, row 1 is # A  A #, row 2 is #      #, row 3 is #    HA#, row 4 is #    S #, row 5 is # SS S #, row 6 is #  SSS #, row 7 is ########.\n\nSo the head H is in row 3. Let's find the coordinates. Each row is 8 characters (since it's 8x8). Let's index columns 0 to 7.\n\nRow 3: \"#    HA#\" → characters are: 0:'#', 1:' ', 2:' ', 3:' ', 4:'H', 5:'A', 6:'#', 7: (wait, no, 8 columns. Let's count each character:\n\nRow 3: index 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is ' ', 4 is 'H', 5 is 'A', 6 is '#', 7? Wait, 8x8 board. Each row has 8 characters. Let's see: \"#    HA#\" → let's count the characters: 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: 'A', 6: '#', 7: '#'? Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let's check the example given in the problem. The example's board is:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nWhich is 8 rows, each 8 characters. So each row is 8 characters. So row 3 in the example is \"#H     #\", which is 8 characters: 0:'#', 1:'H', 2:' ', 3:' ', 4:' ', 5:' ', 6:' ', 7:'#'.\n\nSo applying that, let's parse the current game board's rows properly.\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7: all '#')\nRow 1: # A  A # → columns 0:'#', 1:' ', 2:'A', 3:' ', 4:' ', 5:'A', 6:' ', 7:'#'\nRow 2: #      # → columns 0:'#', 1-6:' ', 7:'#'\nRow 3: #    HA# → columns 0:'#', 1:' ', 2:' ', 3:' ', 4:'H', 5:'A', 6:' ', 7:'#'? Wait, maybe I need to count correctly. Let's split each row into 8 characters:\n\nRow 3: \"#    HA#\" → let's see: 0 is '#', then four spaces (columns 1-4?), then H at 4, A at 5, then '#' at 6? Wait, 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'? Because 8 characters. So 0,7 are '#', 1-6 are the inner.\n\nSo the head (H) is at row 3, column 4.\n\nCurrent direction is UP. So the snake is moving UP. When it moves, the head will go to row 2 (since UP decreases the row number). Let's check where that is. The current head is at (row 3, column 4). Moving UP would take it to (row 2, column 4). Let's check what's there. Row 2 is \"#      #\", which is all spaces except the walls. So (row 2, column 4) is a space. So if the snake continues moving UP, the new head position is (2,4). Then, the body parts will follow. Since the snake's length is more than 1, the body is made of 'S's. Let's check the current body positions.\n\nCurrent body positions (S's):\n\nRow 4: #    S # → column 4 is 'S' → (4,4)\nRow 5: # SS S # → let's parse. Columns 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 4: 'S' → (5,1), (5,2), (5,4)\nRow 6: #  SSS # → columns 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S' → (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo the snake's body is in positions (4,4), (5,1), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). The head is at (3,4). So the snake's current path is: head (3,4) → next body part (4,4) → then (5,4) → (5,2), (5,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). Wait, perhaps the body is a chain. The snake moves by adding a new head and removing the tail (unless it eats an apple). Since the snake's current direction is UP, the previous direction (before moving) was such that the body follows. Let's think: when the snake moves, the head moves in the current direction, and each body segment follows the one in front. So the body's positions are the previous positions of the head and body segments.\n\nBut perhaps for collision detection, we just need to check if the new head position (after moving) is a wall (row 0 or 7, column 0 or 7) or a body part (any S).\n\nSo if the snake continues moving UP (current direction is UP), the new head position is (2,4). Let's check if that's a wall: row 2 is between 0 and 7, column 4 is between 0 and 7 (since columns 0 and 7 are walls). So (2,4) is within the board. Is (2,4) a body part? The body parts are (4,4), (5,1), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (2,4) is not among them, so no collision. So moving UP is safe.\n\nWhat if we turn LEFT? The current direction is UP. Turning LEFT would mean the new direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction, so LEFT is allowed (since UP's reverse is DOWN). So direction LEFT is possible.\n\nIf direction is LEFT, the head moves to (3,3) (since LEFT decreases column by 1). Let's check (3,3): in row 3, column 3. Row 3 is \"#    HA#\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (3,3) is a space. No collision with walls. Is (3,3) a body part? Current body parts are (4,4), (5,1), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (3,3) is not in that list. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: current direction is UP, so RIGHT is allowed (not reverse). The head would move to (3,5). Let's check (3,5). Row 3, column 5 is 'A' (from row 3: \"#    HA#\" → column 5 is 'A'). So moving RIGHT would take the head to (3,5), which is an apple. Eating the apple would make the snake grow. So the snake would grow, and the apple would be replaced (but the problem states that when the snake eats an apple, the next state's board has the head there, and the body grows. Let's confirm: in the example given, when the snake moves DOWN and eats an apple, the head moves to the apple's position, and the body increases by one (so the previous head becomes a body part). So in the example, original head is in row 3 (H), moving DOWN to row 4 (which has A). The new head is at row 4 (H), and the previous head position (row 3) becomes S.\n\nSo if the snake moves RIGHT (direction RIGHT), the head is moving from (3,4) to (3,5). That's an apple (A). So eating the apple. Then, the snake's length increases by 1, so the body will include the previous head position (3,4) as S, and the new head is at (3,5). The apple at (3,5) is consumed, so that square becomes H. Are there other apples? The current board has A's in row 1, columns 2 and 5 (row 1: # A  A # → columns 2 and 5). So after eating the A at (3,5), that's one apple eaten. The score increases by 1.\n\nBut what about collision? (3,5) is an apple, not a body part. So moving RIGHT is safe. The new head is at (3,5), which is within the board (row 3, column 5: columns 0 and 7 are walls, so 5 is okay). So no collision.\n\nSo possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each.\n\nOption 1: UP. New head at (2,4). Safe, no apple here (row 2, column 4 is space). So snake moves, no growth. The body will shift: the previous head (3,4) becomes S, and the tail (the last S) is removed (since no apple eaten). Let's see current body. The snake's body is S's. The length of the snake: head (H) + number of S's. Let's count S's: row 4 has 1 S, row 5 has 3 S's (columns 1,2,4), row 6 has 3 S's (columns 2,3,4). So 1+3+3=7 S's. So total length is 8 (since H is 1, plus 7 S's). So when moving without eating, the snake moves: new head (2,4), then the body follows. The tail (the last S) would be removed. Let's say the tail is at (6,4) (since row 6, column 4 is S). So after moving UP, the new body would be (3,4) (previous H), (4,4), (5,4), (5,2), (5,1), (6,2), (6,3). The tail (6,4) is removed. So (2,4) is H, (3,4) is S, etc. So no problem. But no apple eaten.\n\nOption 2: LEFT. New head at (3,3). That's a space. So snake moves, no apple. The body shifts, tail is removed. Safe, but no score.\n\nOption 3: RIGHT. New head at (3,5) (A). Eat apple, score increases. The snake grows by 1, so the tail is not removed. The new body will include all previous S's plus the previous head (3,4) as S. So the new body positions would be (3,4) (now S), (4,4), (5,4), (5,2), (5,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). The new head is (3,5) as H. The apple at (3,5) is consumed, so that square is now H. Are there any other apples? The current board has A's in row 1, columns 2 and 5. So (1,2) and (1,5) are A's. So after eating (3,5), there are two apples left.\n\nSo moving RIGHT would allow the snake to eat an apple, which is good. Now, check if moving RIGHT would cause a collision. The new head is (3,5). Are there any S's there? The current S's are (4,4), (5,1), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (3,5) is not among them, so no collision. The walls are at columns 0 and 7, rows 0 and 7. (3,5) is within the board, so no wall collision. So moving RIGHT is safe and gains a point.\n\nIs there any reason not to move RIGHT? Let's check if after moving RIGHT, the next move would be possible. The new direction would be RIGHT. The snake's new head is at (3,5). The next move (epoch 23) would be in direction RIGHT (unless changed). Let's see where that would take it. Next move direction could be UP, DOWN (can't reverse RIGHT, which is reverse of LEFT), or RIGHT (current direction). Wait, the direction after moving RIGHT would be RIGHT (since the player can choose direction, but can't reverse. So after moving RIGHT, the current direction becomes RIGHT, so the next direction can't be LEFT. But that's future. For now, moving RIGHT is safe and gives a point.\n\nOther options: moving UP or LEFT don't give apples, so RIGHT is better. Therefore, the best direction is RIGHT.\n\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#    HA#\n#    S #\n# SS S #\n#  SSS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 3, column 4).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Apples**: There are apples at (row 1, column 2), (row 1, column 5), and (row 3, column 5).\n- **Body Segments (S)**: Located at (4,4), (5,1), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). No immediate collision risk with these positions.\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: The head would move to (row 2, column 4), which is empty (no apple). Safe but no score gain.\n2. **LEFT**: The head would move to (row 3, column 3), which is empty (no apple). Safe but no score gain.\n3. **RIGHT**: The head would move to (row 3, column 5), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. The new head position (3,5) is within bounds and not occupied by the snake’s body, so no collision.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score, with no risk of collision. This is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # A  A # (so positions (1,1) is A, (1,4) is A)\nRow 2: # A    # (position (2,1) is A)\nRow 3: #    SH# (positions (3,4) is S, (3,5) is H)\nRow 4: #    S # (position (4,4) is S)\nRow 5: # SS S # (positions (5,1) S, (5,2) S, (5,4) S)\nRow 6: #  SSS # (positions (6,2) S, (6,3) S, (6,4) S)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head is at (3,5) (row 3, column 5, assuming rows are 0-based from top to bottom and columns 0-based from left to right). The current direction is RIGHT. Since the snake is moving RIGHT, normally, the next position the head would move to is (3,6). Let's check if that's a valid move.\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction, so the possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since reversing would be LEFT, which is not allowed).\n\nFirst, let's check the next positions for each possible direction:\n\nCurrent head position: (3,5).\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So the snake's body is behind it. Let's track the snake's body to know where it's moving. The head is at (3,5). The next part of the body (since length is more than 1) would be where the head was in the previous step. Let's see the body positions:\n\nRow 3: (3,4) is S (so that's the next segment after the head)\nRow 4: (4,4) is S\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,2), (5,4) are S\nRow 6: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) are S\n\nSo the snake's body is in a sort of path. Let's list all S and H positions (since H is the head):\n\nH: (3,5)\nS: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,2), (5,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) ?\n\nWait, row 5: # SS S #. Let's break down row 5 (index 5). The row is \"# SS S #\". So columns 0 is #, 1 is S, 2 is S, 3 is space, 4 is S, 5 is space, 6 is #. So positions (5,1), (5,2), (5,4) are S.\n\nRow 6: #  SSS #. Columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: S, 3: S, 4: S, 5: space, 6: #. So (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) are S.\n\nRow 4: #    S #. Columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: S, 5: space, 6: #. So (4,4) is S.\n\nRow 3: #    SH#. Columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: S, 5: H, 6: #. So (3,4) is S, (3,5) is H.\n\nSo the snake's body segments (excluding head) are: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1). Let's confirm the order. The snake moves in direction RIGHT, so the head is at (3,5). The previous position of the head was (3,4) (since moving RIGHT from (3,4) to (3,5)), so (3,4) is the first body segment. Then, before that, the head was at (4,4), moving up? Because (3,4) is above (4,4). So (4,4) is the next segment. Then (5,4), (6,4) (moving down). Then (6,3) (left), (6,2) (left), (5,2) (up), (5,1) (left). So the snake's body is arranged in that path.\n\nNow, the possible directions the player can choose are UP, DOWN, LEFT (but wait, the current direction is RIGHT. The rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. So reversing from RIGHT would be LEFT. So the player cannot choose LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since RIGHT is the current direction, which is allowed to continue).\n\nSo possible directions to choose: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each direction:\n\n1. Direction RIGHT: Next head position is (3,6). Let's check if that's a wall or body. The row 3 is \"#    SH#\", so column 6 is # (since row 3's last character is #). So (3,6) is a wall. So moving RIGHT would cause collision with the wall. Game over. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\n2. Direction UP: The next head position would be (2,5). Let's check (2,5). Row 2 is \"# A    #\". Let's parse row 2: columns 0: #, 1: A, 2: space, 3: space, 4: space, 5: space, 6: #. So (2,5) is a space. Is there a body there? Current body positions are (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1). (2,5) is not in these positions. So moving UP to (2,5) is safe. Also, check if there's an apple there. (2,5) is a space, no apple. So after moving UP, the head is at (2,5). The body segments would shift: the old head (3,5) becomes S, and the last segment (5,1) would be removed (since the snake didn't eat an apple). Wait, but when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (last segment) is removed. So the new body would be (3,5) (old head), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2). Because the tail (5,1) is removed.\n\n3. Direction DOWN: Next head position is (4,5). Let's check (4,5). Row 4 is \"#    S #\". Columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: S, 5: space, 6: #. So (4,5) is a space. Is there a body there? The current body positions are the S's listed before, none at (4,5). So (4,5) is safe. Check for apple: no, (4,5) is space. So moving DOWN to (4,5) is safe.\n\nNow, we need to check if moving UP or DOWN leads to possible apples. Let's look at the positions of the apples. The apples are at:\n\nRow 1: (1,1) and (1,4)\nRow 2: (2,1)\n\nSo apples are at (1,1), (1,4), (2,1). The current head is at (3,5). Let's see which direction can lead towards the apples.\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (2,5), then next possible moves (since direction would now be UP, and can't reverse to DOWN). From (2,5), possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since current direction is UP, can't reverse to DOWN). Let's see if moving UP again would take it to (1,5). (1,5) is row 1, column 5. Row 1 is \"# A  A #\", so (1,5) is a space. Then (0,5) is a wall (row 0 is all #). So moving up from (1,5) would hit a wall. Alternatively, from (2,5), moving LEFT would take to (2,4), then (2,3), etc. Maybe towards (2,1) apple.\n\nIf moving DOWN to (4,5), then next direction could be DOWN (to (5,5)), but row 5 is \"# SS S #\", (5,5) is a space. Then (6,5) is a space (row 6: \"#  SSS #\"), (6,5) is space. (7,5) is a wall. So moving down from (4,5) would eventually hit the bottom wall.\n\nAlternatively, after moving UP to (2,5), maybe turn LEFT to (2,4), then (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) which is an apple. That's a path. Let's check if that path is possible.\n\nCurrent head after moving UP: (2,5). Direction is UP. Next move could be LEFT (since can't reverse to DOWN). So direction LEFT. Then the head moves to (2,4). Is that safe? (2,4) is a space (row 2: \"# A    #\", column 4 is space). Then direction LEFT again (current direction is LEFT, can't reverse to RIGHT). Head moves to (2,3), then (2,2), (2,1) (which is an apple). That's a good path. So moving UP now allows the snake to reach (2,1) apple in a few steps.\n\nIf moving DOWN to (4,5), then direction could be LEFT (since current direction is DOWN, can't reverse to UP). So next direction LEFT would take to (4,4), but (4,4) is a current body segment (since in row 4, (4,4) is S). Oh wait! (4,4) is part of the snake's body. So if the snake moves DOWN to (4,5), then the next move direction LEFT would take the head to (4,4), which is a body segment. That's a collision. So that's bad.\n\nWait, let's confirm: when moving DOWN, the head is at (4,5). The body segments would be (3,5) (old head), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2). Because the tail (5,1) is removed. So (4,4) is still part of the body. So if the snake moves DOWN to (4,5), then the next move in direction LEFT would take head to (4,4), which is S (body), collision.\n\nAlternatively, after moving DOWN to (4,5), direction could be RIGHT. But (4,6) is a wall (row 4 ends with # at column 6). So RIGHT is invalid. Direction DOWN again would take to (5,5). (5,5) is space. Then direction DOWN to (6,5), then (7,5) which is a wall. So that's not helpful.\n\nSo moving UP seems better. Let's check again:\n\nCurrent possible directions:\n\n- RIGHT: leads to wall (invalid)\n- UP: (2,5) is safe, no collision, no apple. Then next moves can head towards (2,1) apple.\n- DOWN: (4,5) is safe, but next moves might hit body or walls.\n\nAlternatively, are there any other apples in the current positions that the snake can reach quickly? The apples are at (1,1), (1,4), (2,1). The head is at (3,5). The closest apple is (2,1) (distance 4 steps left and 1 up). (1,4) is (1,4) which is row 1, column 4. From (3,5) to (1,4): need to move up twice (to row 1) and left once (to column 4). That's 3 steps. Let's see.\n\nIf the snake moves UP first, to (2,5). Then direction LEFT (current direction is UP, can't reverse to DOWN, so possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT). So moving LEFT to (2,4), then LEFT to (2,3), then LEFT to (2,2), then LEFT to (2,1) (apple). That's 4 steps. That's possible.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake first moves UP to (2,5), then UP again to (1,5). Then LEFT to (1,4), which is an apple. That's 3 steps. Let's check that path.\n\nMoving UP from (3,5) to (2,5) (step 1). Then direction UP again (since current direction is UP, allowed) to (1,5) (step 2). (1,5) is space. Then direction LEFT (current direction is UP, so possible to turn LEFT) to (1,4) (step 3), which is an apple. That's a valid path. Because (1,4) is an apple. So moving UP now, then UP, then LEFT would reach the apple (1,4) in 3 steps.\n\nYes, (1,4) is an apple. So (1,4) is in row 1, column 4. Let's confirm the row 1: \"# A  A #\". So columns 1: A, 4: A. So (1,4) is A.\n\nSo moving UP first step (current move), then next step UP (to (1,5)), then LEFT (to (1,4)), which is an apple. That's a good plan.\n\nSo the first move (current epoch) should be UP, which is safe. Because moving RIGHT is into a wall (game over), moving DOWN may not lead to apples as quickly and could hit body. So the best direction is UP.\n\n\n########\n# A  A #\n# A    #\n#    SH#\n#    S #\n# SS S #\n#  SSS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: (3,5) (row 3, column 5).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since LEFT is a reversal of RIGHT).\n- **Walls**: The board is enclosed by '#' (edges are walls).\n- **Apples**: Positions (1,1), (1,4), (2,1).\n- **Snake Body**: Segments at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1).\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **RIGHT**: Next head position would be (3,6), which is a wall (row 3 ends with '#'). Collision → Game Over. **Invalid**.\n2. **DOWN**: Next head position is (4,5). This is a safe empty space, but subsequent moves risk collision with the snake’s body (e.g., moving LEFT from (4,5) would reach (4,4), a body segment). **Suboptimal**.\n3. **UP**: Next head position is (2,5). This is a safe empty space. From (2,5), the snake can move UP to (1,5) (safe), then LEFT to (1,4) (an apple), allowing the snake to eat an apple and grow. **Optimal**.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, let's start by understanding the current game board. Let me repeat the board as per the instructions.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n# A  A #\n# A   H#\n#    SS#\n#    S #\n#  S S #\n#  SSS #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the epoch is 24. The snake is moving up. Let's break down the positions.\n\nFirst, the snake's head is 'H'. Let's find its position. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow 1 (second line, since the first is ########): # A  A # → row 1 (index 1 if 0-based)\nRow 2: # A   H# → row 2. The H is in this row. Let's find the column. The row is \"# A   H#\". Let's index the columns from 0 (leftmost) to 7 (rightmost, since it's 8x8). The row is characters: 0: #, 1: space, 2: A, 3: space, 4: space, 5: space, 6: H, 7: #. So H is at (row 2, column 6).\n\nCurrent direction is UP. So the snake is moving up. The next position the head would move to is (row 2 - 1, column 6) → (row 1, column 6). Let's check that position. Row 1 is \"# A  A #\". Let's index that row: 0: #, 1: space, 2: A, 3: space, 4: space, 5: A, 6: space, 7: #. So (row 1, column 6) is a space. So if the snake continues moving UP, the head moves there. But we need to check if that's a valid move (no collision with walls or itself).\n\nBut wait, the snake's body is 'S's. Let's map all the S positions. Let's list all the S positions:\n\nRow 3: #    SS# → columns 4 and 5 (since the row is \"#    SS#\" → 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: S, 5: S, 6: space, 7: # → (3,4), (3,5)\nRow 4: #    S # → columns 4: S → (4,4)\nRow 5: #  S S # → columns 2: S, 4: S → (5,2), (5,4)\nRow 6: #  SSS # → columns 2,3,4: S → (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo the snake's body is at these positions. The head is at (2,6). Current direction is UP. Next head position if moving UP is (1,6). Let's check if that's a wall. The walls are the # around the edges. Row 0 is all #, row 7 is all #. Columns 0 and 7 are # in all rows. (1,6) is column 6, row 1. The row 1 is \"# A  A #\", which at column 6 is a space (since the characters are [0]#, [1] , [2]A, [3] , [4] , [5]A, [6] , [7]#). So (1,6) is a space. No collision with body here, because the body S's are in rows 3,4,5,6, columns 2-5. So (1,6) is safe.\n\nBut maybe there's an apple in that position? Let's check. The apples are 'A's. In row 1, the A's are at (1,2) and (1,5). So (1,6) is not an apple. So moving UP would just move the head to (1,6), and the body would follow. The snake's length would remain the same (since no apple eaten).\n\nBut what are the other possible directions? The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is UP. So the snake can't go DOWN (reverse). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.\n\nLet's check each possible direction.\n\nOption 1: UP. Next head position (1,6). Check if that's a wall or body. As above, it's safe. No apple here. So snake moves there.\n\nOption 2: LEFT. The direction would be LEFT. The next head position would be (2,6-1) = (2,5). Let's check (2,5). The row 2 is \"# A   H#\". The H is at (2,6). So row 2 is [0]#, [1] , [2]A, [3] , [4] , [5] , [6]H, [7]#. So (2,5) is a space. Is that a body part? The body S's are in rows 3-6, columns 2-5. So (2,5) is not a body part. So moving LEFT is possible.\n\nCheck if (2,5) has an apple. No, row 2's A is at (2,2). So (2,5) is space. So moving LEFT would take the head to (2,5). Safe.\n\nOption 3: RIGHT. Direction RIGHT. Next head position (2,6+1) = (2,7). Column 7 is a wall (since all rows have # at column 7). So (2,7) is a wall. Collision. So RIGHT is invalid. The snake would die if moving RIGHT. So RIGHT is not allowed.\n\nOption 4: DOWN. Reverse direction (current is UP, so DOWN is reverse). Not allowed. So direction can't be DOWN.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, LEFT.\n\nNow, which is better? Let's look for apples. The apples are at positions:\n\nRow 1 (second line): # A  A # → (1,2), (1,5)\nRow 2: # A   H# → (2,2)\nSo three apples: (1,2), (1,5), (2,2).\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,6). Let's see the positions of the apples and the possible paths.\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (1,6). Then next possible moves. From (1,6), possible directions (can't reverse, so if current direction is UP, next direction can't be DOWN). So possible directions would be UP (row 0, which is a wall), LEFT (row 1, column 5: which is an apple (1,5)!), RIGHT (column 7, wall), or continue UP (row 0, wall). So moving UP to (1,6), next direction could be LEFT. (1,6) moving LEFT would go to (1,5), which is an apple. That's good. Because if the head moves to (1,5), it eats the apple, grows, and score increases.\n\nSo moving UP now, then LEFT next epoch would get the apple at (1,5).\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves LEFT now to (2,5). Then next possible directions. Current direction would be LEFT. So can't reverse to RIGHT. So next direction options: LEFT (column 4), UP (row 1, column 5), DOWN (row 3, column 5). Let's see (2,5) is the new head. What's around (2,5):\n\nRow 2, column 5 is now the head. Next possible moves. Let's check if (2,5) is adjacent to any apples. The apples are (2,2), (1,2), (1,5). (2,5) is (row 2, column 5). The apple at (1,5) is row 1, column 5. So if direction is UP from (2,5), then head moves to (1,5) (which is an apple). That's a good move. So if the snake moves LEFT to (2,5) now, then next epoch can move UP to (1,5) and eat the apple.\n\nSo both UP and LEFT could lead to getting the apple at (1,5) in the next step. But let's check if moving UP now is possible. Let's confirm the next positions.\n\nCurrent head (2,6). Direction UP: next head (1,6). Then, the body would shift. The current body is a chain. The snake's body is S's, and the movement is such that each body part follows the previous one. Since the snake's length is the number of S's plus 1 (the head). Let's count the S's. Let's see:\n\nRow 3 has two S's: (3,4), (3,5)\nRow 4 has one S: (4,4)\nRow 5 has two S's: (5,2), (5,4)\nRow 6 has three S's: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\nTotal S's: 2+1+2+3=8. So the snake's length is 8+1=9. So when moving, the head moves to (1,6), and each body part moves to the position of the previous part. So the last body part (the tail) would move forward, but since the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail is removed (if not growing). Wait, no. In snake games, when you move, the head moves forward, and each body segment follows the one in front. If you eat an apple, the tail doesn't get removed (so length increases by 1). Otherwise, the tail is removed (so length stays the same). So in this case, since moving UP doesn't eat an apple, the tail will move, and the snake's body will shift.\n\nBut regardless, the key is to avoid collision. Let's make sure that moving UP or LEFT doesn't cause the head to hit the body in the next steps.\n\nIf moving UP to (1,6):\n\nCheck (1,6) for body. The current body is in rows 3-6, columns 2-5, so (1,6) is safe.\n\nIf moving LEFT to (2,5):\n\nCheck (2,5) for body. The current body S's are in rows 3-6, columns 2-5. (2,5) is row 2, column 5. Are there any S's there? No. So (2,5) is safe.\n\nSo both directions are safe. Now, which direction allows the snake to reach an apple faster?\n\nThe apple at (1,5) is in row 1, column 5. Let's see the distance.\n\nFrom current head (2,6):\n\nIf moving UP to (1,6), then moving LEFT to (1,5) → that's one move (epoch 25: UP, epoch 26: LEFT). So in epoch 26, the head would be at (1,5), which is an apple. So that's two steps.\n\nIf moving LEFT to (2,5) now (epoch 25: LEFT), then moving UP to (1,5) (epoch 26: UP). That's also two steps, but the apple is eaten in epoch 26 either way.\n\nAlternatively, is there another apple closer? The apple at (2,2) is in row 2, column 2. The head is at (2,6). The distance is 4 columns to the left. That's further. The apple at (1,2) is row 1, column 2. Also further.\n\nSo the closest apples are (1,5) and (2,2)\/(1,2). So (1,5) is the closest.\n\nSo either direction (UP then LEFT, or LEFT then UP) can reach (1,5) in two steps. But we need to choose the direction for epoch 25.\n\nAnother thing to consider: after moving UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. After moving LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT.\n\nIf we move UP now (epoch 25 direction UP), then in epoch 26, the direction could be LEFT (since current direction would be UP, and LEFT is allowed). Then head moves to (1,5) (apple), which is good.\n\nIf we move LEFT now (epoch 25 direction LEFT), then in epoch 26, the direction could be UP (since current direction would be LEFT, and UP is allowed). Then head moves to (1,5) (apple), which is also good.\n\nSo both options are possible. But are there any other factors? Let's check the body positions to see if any direction could lead to a collision in the next steps.\n\nFor example, if moving LEFT to (2,5), then next move UP to (1,5). Let's check (1,5). The row 1 is \"# A  A #\", which has an A at (1,5). So (1,5) is an apple. So moving there would eat it, the snake grows, and the score increases. That's good.\n\nIf moving UP to (1,6), then next move LEFT to (1,5). (1,5) is an apple. Same result.\n\nSo both directions are valid. But perhaps there's a better option. Let's see if there's any immediate danger. For example, if the snake moves UP, (1,6) is a safe position, and the body is not in that area. If it moves LEFT, (2,5) is also safe.\n\nIs there a direction that allows more flexibility? Let's see the current body. The snake's body is in the lower part of the board (rows 3-6). The head is in row 2, column 6, which is upper right. Moving UP takes it to row 1, column 6 (upper right), while moving LEFT takes it to row 2, column 5 (middle right). Both are in the right part of the board, away from the body, which is in the left and middle lower areas. So no immediate collision risk.\n\nSo perhaps either direction is acceptable, but the problem requires choosing one. Since the question is to pick the best direction, perhaps either UP or LEFT is correct, but let's check if there's any other apple that can be reached faster.\n\nAnother apple is at (2,2) (row 2, column 2). The head is at (2,6). To reach (2,2), the snake would need to move left four times. That's longer. The apple at (1,2) (row 1, column 2) would require moving up then left, which is even further.\n\nSo the best option is to go for the closest apple at (1,5). Both UP then LEFT or LEFT then UP can reach it. Let's see which direction is possible.\n\nCurrent direction is UP. If we choose UP, then the next direction can be LEFT. If we choose LEFT, then next direction can be UP. Both are allowed.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP now is better. Because moving UP would take the head to (1,6), which is adjacent to (1,5) (the apple). So in the next step, moving LEFT would reach the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now takes the head to (2,5), which is adjacent to (1,5) (the apple), so moving UP next step would reach it.\n\nEither way, it's two steps. Since the problem is to choose the direction for epoch 25, and both are safe, perhaps either is acceptable. But maybe the optimal choice is to move UP, as the current direction is UP, and changing direction to LEFT might not be necessary. But I think either is correct, but perhaps the best answer is UP, since it's the current direction and moving in that direction is allowed and safe.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A  A #\n# A   H#\n#    SS#\n#    S #\n#  S S #\n#  SSS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (row 2, column 6) and is currently moving UP. The goal is to choose a safe direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) that avoids collisions with walls or the snake's body ('S') and ideally leads toward apples ('A').\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: The next head position would be (row 1, column 6). Checking this position:\n   - It is not a wall (row 1, column 6 is a space).\n   - It is not part of the snake's body (the body occupies rows 3-6, columns 2-5).\n   - No apple is present here, but this position is adjacent to the apple at (row 1, column 5). Moving UP now allows the snake to then move LEFT in the next epoch to reach the apple at (row 1, column 5).\n\n2. **LEFT**: The next head position would be (row 2, column 5). Checking this position:\n   - It is not a wall (row 2, column 5 is a space).\n   - It is not part of the snake's body.\n   - No apple is present here, but this position is adjacent to the apple at (row 1, column 5). Moving LEFT now allows the snake to then move UP in the next epoch to reach the apple at (row 1, column 5).\n\n3. **RIGHT**: The next head position would be (row 2, column 7), which is a wall (column 7 is a wall in all rows). This would cause a collision, so RIGHT is invalid.\n\n4. **DOWN**: Reversing the current direction (UP → DOWN) is not allowed, so DOWN is invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe. However, moving UP maintains the current direction and positions the head closer to the apple at (row 1, column 5), making it a straightforward path to the apple in the next epoch.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by parsing the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # A  AH#\nRow 2: # A   S#\nRow 3: #    SS#\nRow 4: #    S #\nRow 5: #    S #\nRow 6: #  SSS #\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo, the snake's head is 'H'. Let's find where 'H' is. Looking at row 1 (second row), the characters are '# A  AH#'. Let's index from 0. The row is:\n\n0: #, 1: space, 2: A, 3: space, 4: space, 5: A, 6: H, 7: #\n\nSo H is at (row 1, column 6). Because rows are 0-based from top. So row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom. So H's position is (1,6). \n\nThe current direction is UP. Since the snake is moving UP, the next move (if we don't change direction) would be to move to (0,6), but row 0 is a wall (all #), so that's a collision. Oh wait, the current direction is UP, so moving up from (1,6) would be row 0, column 6. Row 0 is ########, so that's a wall. So if we keep moving UP, the snake will hit the wall and the game ends. So we can't go UP.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is UP, so reversing would be DOWN. But can we turn to LEFT or RIGHT? Let's check the possible directions. The allowed directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, but cannot reverse. Since current direction is UP, the reverse is DOWN, so we can't go DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. But moving UP is into a wall, which is bad. So options are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check the possible next positions for each direction.\n\nCurrent head position: (1,6). Let's note the body positions. The body is 'S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,5) is A, (1,6) is H. Row 2: # A   S#. Let's index row 2 (third row) as:\n\n0: #, 1: space, 2: A, 3: space, 4: space, 5: space, 6: S, 7: #. So (2,6) is S.\n\nRow 3: #    SS#. So row 3, columns 5 and 6 are S. (3,5) and (3,6) are S.\n\nRow 4: #    S #. So (4,5) is S.\n\nRow 5: #    S #. So (5,5) is S.\n\nRow 6: #  SSS #. Let's index row 6: 0: #, 1: space, 2: S, 3: S, 4: S, 5: space, 6: #. So (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) are S.\n\nSo the snake's body is a chain. Let's try to map the snake's body segments. Since the snake moves in UP direction, the head is (1,6). The next body part (since it's moving up) would be the previous position of the head. Let's think about the snake's path.\n\nCurrent direction is UP. So the previous move was moving up. Let's track the body:\n\nHead is at (1,6). The next body part (S) should be where the head was before the last move. Let's see. The current direction is UP, so the head moved up from (2,6) to (1,6). Because moving up from (2,6) would reach (1,6). So (2,6) is the first body segment (S). Then the next S would be (3,6), since the snake was moving up, so (3,6) is next. Then (4,6)? Wait, let's check row 3: #    SS#. So (3,5) and (3,6) are S. Oh, maybe the snake's body is a bit more complex. Let's list all S positions:\n\nS positions:\n\nRow 2: (2,6)\n\nRow 3: (3,5), (3,6)\n\nRow 4: (4,5)\n\nRow 5: (5,5)\n\nRow 6: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo perhaps the snake's body is not a straight line. Let's see. The head is at (1,6). The next body part (S) would be (2,6), as that's the immediate next in the direction of movement. Then (3,6) (row 3, column 6), which is S. Then (3,5) (row 3, column 5) is S. Then (4,5) (row 4, column 5), (5,5) (row 5, column 5), (6,5) but row 6 has S at 2,3,4. So maybe the snake is turning. Hmm, perhaps the body is a chain. Let's not get too bogged down, but need to check possible next moves.\n\nNow, possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, UP (but UP is into wall), DOWN (reverse, not allowed). So options are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check moving LEFT: direction LEFT. So the head would move from (1,6) to (1,5). What's at (1,5)? Looking at row 1: # A  AH#. So row 1's columns are 0: #, 1: space, 2: A, 3: space, 4: space, 5: A, 6: H, 7: #. So (1,5) is A. Oh, that's an apple! So if we move LEFT, the head goes to (1,5), which is an apple. Then, the snake eats the apple, grows in length, and the apple is replaced (but the example shows that when the snake eats an apple, the head moves there, and the body increases. So the new head is (1,5), and the previous head (1,6) becomes S. Then the rest of the body follows. Let's confirm.\n\nIn the example given:\n\nOriginal board (example):\n\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN. So moving down from H's position (row 3, column 1) to row 4, column 1 (since row 3 is #H     #, so H is (3,1). Moving down (row 4) would be (4,1). Row 4 is #AA    #, so (4,1) is A. So after moving down, H moves to (4,1), which is A. The previous H position (3,1) becomes S. The S in row 2 (2,1) would move to (3,1), and the rest follows. The new board shows row 4 as #HA    # (H at 4,1, A at 4,2). The row 3 becomes #S     # (S at 3,1), row 2 remains #S     #. So when you eat an apple, the head moves to the apple's position, the previous head becomes S, and the body extends (since the snake grows). So the length increases by 1.\n\nIn our current case, moving LEFT from (1,6) to (1,5) which is A. So that's a good move. The head would be at (1,5), which is an apple. So the snake eats it, score increases by 1, and the snake grows. The previous head (1,6) becomes S, and the rest of the body follows. Since it's an apple, no collision. That's safe.\n\nWhat about moving RIGHT? The head is at (1,6). Moving RIGHT would take it to (1,7). But row 1, column 7 is # (the wall). So (1,7) is a wall. That's a collision, game over. So moving RIGHT is bad.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN? Oh, current direction is UP, so reversing to DOWN is not allowed. So the snake can't turn directly from UP to DOWN. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo the only valid directions are LEFT and RIGHT (since UP is into wall, and DOWN is reverse). But RIGHT is into a wall, so only LEFT is possible. So moving LEFT would be the correct direction.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A  AH#\n# A   S#\n#    SS#\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#  SSS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1, 6). The current direction is UP. Moving UP would take the head to (0, 6), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'), causing a collision. Reversing direction to DOWN is not allowed. \n\nNext, consider moving RIGHT: the head would move to (1, 7), which is a wall (row 1, column 7 is '#'), also causing a collision. \n\nMoving LEFT: the head would move to (1, 5), which is an apple ('A'). Eating this apple is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body) and increases the score. \n\nThus, the only valid and safe direction is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # A AHS# (positions 1-5: ' ', 'A', ' ', 'A', 'H', 'S')\nRow 2: # A   S# (positions 1-5: ' ', 'A', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'S')\nRow 3: #    SS# (positions 1-5: ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'S', 'S')\nRow 4: #    S # (positions 1-5: ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'S', ' ')\nRow 5: #    S # (positions 1-5: ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'S', ' ')\nRow 6: #  SSS # (positions 1-5: ' ', ' ', 'S', 'S', 'S', ' ')\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the snake's head is at position (1,4) because row 1 (second row, 0-indexed) has 'H' at column 4. Let's confirm: rows are 0-7, columns 0-7. Each row is 8 characters. For row 1 (index 1), the characters are [0]# [1] [2]A [3] [4]A [5]H [6]S [7]#. Wait, maybe I need to index each row properly. Let's list each row's columns (0-7):\n\nRow 0: 0-7 are all #.\nRow 1: 0=#, 1= (space), 2=A, 3= (space), 4=H, 5=S, 6= (space), 7=#. Wait, the row is \"# A AHS#\" which is 8 characters. Let's split:\n\nRow 1: index 0: #, 1: (space), 2: A, 3: (space), 4: H, 5: S, 6: (space), 7: #. Oh wait, the original row is \"# A AHS#\". Let's count the characters: \"#\", \" \", \"A\", \" \", \"A\", \"H\", \"S\", \"#\". So indexes 0 to 7: 0=#, 1= , 2=A, 3= , 4=A, 5=H, 6=S, 7=#. Oh, that's right. So row 1 is positions 0-7: #, , A, , A, H, S, #.\n\nSo head 'H' is at (row=1, column=5). Because row 1, column 5 is H.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. So when it moves, the head will go to column 5-1=4 (since LEFT decreases the column index). Let's check where that is. The next position if moving LEFT would be (row=1, column=4). What's in that cell? Looking at row 1, column 4: it's 'A' (from row 1: # A AHS# → positions 0-7: #, (1)= , (2)=A, (3)= , (4)=A, (5)=H, (6)=S, (7)=#. So column 4 in row 1 is 'A'. Oh, that's an apple! So if the snake moves LEFT, the head will go to (1,4), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple increases the score and the snake grows.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that moving LEFT is allowed. The current direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction. So possible directions are the ones not opposite to current direction. The opposite of LEFT is RIGHT. So the possible directions the player can choose are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since current direction is LEFT, you can't go RIGHT). So the player can choose to continue moving LEFT, or turn UP or DOWN. But since the snake is moving in direction LEFT, the next movement is in the direction chosen (but the direction can only be changed to non-opposite).\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So the direction input can be any of the four, except the direct reverse. Since current direction is LEFT, the reverse is RIGHT. So the player can input UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since RIGHT is reverse, not allowed). So possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, let's think about the next position if we choose LEFT. The head is at (1,5). Moving LEFT would take it to (1,4). That cell is 'A' (apple). So the snake eats the apple. Then, the snake's length increases. The body parts will follow. The previous head position (1,5) becomes part of the body (so 'S'), and the new head is (1,4). Let's check if there's a collision. The new head (1,4) is an apple, so no collision with self or wall. The walls are the edges, so row 0 and 7, column 0 and 7 are walls. (1,4) is within the board (row 1 is between 0 and 7, column 4 is between 0 and 7), so no wall collision. Also, (1,4) is an apple, not a body part. So moving LEFT is safe and will eat an apple. That's good.\n\nWhat if we choose UP? Current head is (1,5). Moving UP would take it to (0,5). But row 0 is a wall (all #). So that's a collision with the wall. The game would end. So UP is invalid.\n\nWhat about DOWN? Current head is (1,5). Moving DOWN would take it to (2,5). Let's check (2,5) in row 2. Row 2 is \"# A   S#\". So columns 0-7: 0=#, 1= , 2=A, 3= , 4= , 5=S, 6= , 7=#. So (2,5) is 'S' (body part). So moving DOWN would cause the head to hit the snake's own body. That's a collision, game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo the only possible safe direction is LEFT. Because moving LEFT leads to an apple, no collision, and continues the game. Choosing UP would hit the wall, choosing DOWN would hit the body, so LEFT is the only option.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A AHS#\n# A   S#\n#    SS#\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#  SSS #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the snake's current state:\n- The snake's head 'H' is at (row 1, column 5) (0-indexed).\n- Current direction is LEFT, so the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. Possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n- Moving UP would take the head to (row 0, column 5), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'), causing a wall collision (game over).\n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 2, column 5), which is 'S' (snake's body), causing a self-collision (game over).\n- Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 1, column 4), which is 'A' (an apple). This is safe (no collision with walls or self) and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's state.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. The current direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 27. The snake can't reverse direction, so from LEFT, it can't go RIGHT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.\n\nFirst, let's parse the current board:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # A HSS# (columns 1: A, 2:H, 3:S, 4:S, 5: #)\nRow 2: # A   S# (columns 1:A, 5:S)\nRow 3: #    SS# (columns 4:S, 5:S)\nRow 4: #    S # (column 4:S)\nRow 5: #    S # (column 4:S)\nRow 6: #A SSS # (column 1:A, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the snake's head is at row 1, column 2 (since row 1 is \"# A HSS#\", positions are 0-based). Let's confirm positions:\n\nRow 1: index 0 is '#', 1 is 'A', 2 is 'H', 3 is 'S', 4 is 'S', 5 is '#'. So H is (1,2).\n\nThe body segments (S) are:\n\n- (1,3), (1,4) (from row 1: HSS)\n- (2,5) (row 2: \" A   S#\" → column 5 is S)\n- (3,4), (3,5) (row 3: \"    SS#\" → columns 4 and 5)\n- (4,4) (row 4: \"    S #\" → column 4)\n- (5,4) (row 5: \"    S #\" → column 4)\n- (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) (row 6: \"#A SSS #\" → columns 2,3,4)\n\nSo the snake's body is a long chain. Let's list all S positions (excluding H):\n\n(1,3), (1,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The next move direction can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT (can't go RIGHT, as that's reverse). Let's check where the head would go for each possible direction.\n\nCurrent head position: (1,2). Let's note rows are 0-7, columns 0-7 (since 8x8). So (row, column) = (1,2).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n1. LEFT: direction LEFT → column decreases by 1. New head position: (1,2-1) = (1,1). What's there? Row 1, column 1 is 'A' (from row 1: \"# A HSS#\", column 1 is A). So moving LEFT would take the head to an apple. Eating the apple would make the snake grow. The new head is (1,1), and the body would extend. Also, no collision here because (1,1) is A, not S or wall. So that's safe, and gives a point.\n\n2. UP: direction UP → row decreases by 1. New head position: (1-1,2) = (0,2). But row 0 is all walls (row 0: ########), so (0,2) is '#'. That's a wall collision. Game over. So UP is invalid.\n\n3. DOWN: direction DOWN → row increases by 1. New head position: (1+1,2) = (2,2). Let's check row 2: \"# A   S#\". Columns are 0:'#', 1:'A', 2:' ', 3:' ', 4:' ', 5:'S'. So (2,2) is empty space (no S, no wall, no A). So moving DOWN would take the head to (2,2). Now check if that's a body part. The body positions listed earlier don't include (2,2), so it's safe. No collision. But there's no apple here, so the snake just moves, body follows.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT (safe, eat apple), DOWN (safe, no apple), UP (wall, game over). So the best choice is LEFT, since it's safe and gives a point. Also, the snake can't reverse direction (LEFT to RIGHT is reverse, but that's not an option here). So the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A HSS#\n# A   S#\n#    SS#\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#A SSS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state and possible moves. The snake's head is at position (row 1, column 2), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). We evaluate the three valid directions: LEFT, UP, and DOWN.\n\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 1, column 1). Checking this position, row 1, column 1 contains an apple ('A'). This move is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body) and would result in eating the apple, increasing the score by 1.\n\n2. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 0, column 2). Row 0 is a wall ('#'), so this would cause a wall collision, ending the game. This direction is invalid.\n\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 2, column 2). This position is empty (no walls, apples, or snake body segments), so it is safe. However, there is no apple here, so the snake would not gain a point.\n\nThe best choice is LEFT, as it safely eats an apple and avoids collision. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S', and apples are 'A'. The current direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 28. The snake can't reverse direction, so from LEFT, the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT (but can't go RIGHT). \n\nFirst, let's map out the positions. Let's index the rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7), and columns from left (column 0) to right (column 7).\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # AHSSS# → columns 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: 'H', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'\nRow 2: # A   S# → columns 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: 'S', 7: '#'\nRow 3: #    SS# → columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S'? Wait, original row 3 is \"#    SS#\" → columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: '#', so 4 and 5 are 'S'\nRow 4: #    S # → columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 5: #    S # → columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 6: #A  SS # → columns 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at row 1, column 3 (since row 1 is \"# AHSSS#\", so column 3 is H). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 1: columns 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is 'A', 3 is 'H', 4 is 'S', 5 is 'S', 6 is 'S', 7 is '#'. So H is at (1,3).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So the next move, if direction remains LEFT, the head would move to (1, 2) (since LEFT is column -1). Let's check what's at (1,2). The current cell (1,2) is 'A' (apple). So if we move LEFT, the head would go to (1,2), which is an apple. Then the snake would eat it, grow longer, and the score increases. \n\nBut we need to check if moving LEFT is possible. The snake can't reverse direction, but LEFT is the current direction, so continuing LEFT is allowed. Also, (1,2) is within the board (since row 1 is between 0 and 7, column 2 is between 0 and 7). So walls are only on the edges (columns 0 and 7, rows 0 and 7). So (1,2) is inside, not a wall.\n\nWhat about collisions? The current body parts are S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: columns 4,5,6 → (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\nRow 2: column 6 → (2,6)\nRow 3: columns 4,5 → (3,4), (3,5)\nRow 4: column 4 → (4,4)\nRow 5: column 4 → (5,4)\nRow 6: columns 4,5 → (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo the head is at (1,3). If moving LEFT to (1,2), which is 'A' (no S there), so no collision. So that's safe. So moving LEFT would eat the apple, which is good.\n\nWhat if we choose UP? Current direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction (so can't go RIGHT), but UP is allowed. Let's check where UP would take the head. UP is row -1. Current head is at (1,3). UP would take it to (0,3). But row 0 is all walls (since row 0 is \"########\"), so (0,3) is a wall. That would cause a collision, game over. So UP is invalid.\n\nWhat about DOWN? DOWN is row +1. Head is at (1,3). DOWN would take to (2,3). Let's check (2,3). Row 2 is \"# A   S#\", columns 1 is ' ', 2 is 'A', 3 is ' ', 4 is ' ', 5 is ' ', 6 is 'S'. So (2,3) is ' ' (empty). So moving DOWN to (2,3). Now, we need to check if that cell is a body part. The current body positions are all the S's listed earlier. (2,3) is not an S, so safe. But there's no apple there. So the snake would move, no apple eaten. The snake's length would stay the same (since no apple eaten, the tail would move forward, so the body would shift). But the goal is to eat apples. So moving DOWN would not get an apple now.\n\nWhat about RIGHT? Current direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction, so RIGHT is a 180-degree turn, which is not allowed. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. But UP leads to a wall (game over), RIGHT is invalid. So options are LEFT and DOWN.\n\nLEFT leads to (1,2), which is an apple. That's a good move. So the best choice is LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# AHSSS#\n# A   S#\n#    SS#\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#A  SS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (row 1, column 3).\n- Current direction: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot turn RIGHT).\n- Possible directions to consider: LEFT, UP, DOWN (RIGHT is invalid as it reverses the current direction).\n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 1, column 2). This cell contains an 'A' (apple). Eating the apple is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body) and increases the score. This is a valid and beneficial move.\n2. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 0, column 3). Row 0 is a wall (all '#' in row 0), so this would cause a wall collision and end the game. Invalid.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 2, column 3). This cell is empty (' '), with no apple. While safe, it does not contribute to growing the snake or increasing the score. Less optimal than LEFT.\n\nThe best move is to continue moving LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n# HSSSS#\n# A   S#\n# A  SS#\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#A  SS #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, and the current epoch is 29. The snake's head is 'H', body segments are 'S'. The snake is moving LEFT. Since the direction can't be reversed, the snake can't go RIGHT immediately because current direction is LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT (since reversing is not allowed, so LEFT is allowed as it's the current direction).\n\nFirst, let's find the position of the head. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # HSSSS# → The head is at (1,1) (assuming rows are 0-based, columns 0-based). Let's confirm positions:\n\nRow 1 (index 1) has characters: index 0 is '#', index 1 is 'H', then 2,3,4,5 are 'S', index 6 is '#', index 7 is '#'. So head is at (1,1).\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. So moving LEFT would take the head to (1,0), which is a wall (since row 1, column 0 is '#'). So moving LEFT would cause a wall collision, which ends the game. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo the snake can't go LEFT. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Wait, wait, the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. Current direction is LEFT. Reversing direction would be RIGHT (since LEFT and RIGHT are opposites). So the snake can't turn RIGHT, because that's reversing. So possible directions are UP or DOWN. Because the current direction is LEFT, the allowed directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. But moving LEFT is into a wall, which is bad. So options are UP or DOWN.\n\nNow, let's check where the head would move if direction is UP. The head is at (1,1). Moving UP would take it to (0,1). But row 0 is all '#', so (0,1) is a wall. So UP direction would also hit a wall. That's a collision, game over. So UP is invalid.\n\nNext, direction DOWN. Head is at (1,1). Moving DOWN would take it to (2,1). Let's check row 2: # A   S#. So row 2, column 1 is 'A' (since row 2 is \"# A   S#\" → positions 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: '#', 7: '#')? Wait, let me parse each row properly.\n\nRow 1: \"# HSSSS#\" → indexes 0-7: 0='#', 1='H', 2='S', 3='S', 4='S', 5='S', 6='#', 7='#'\n\nRow 2: \"# A   S#\" → 0='#', 1=' ', 2='A', 3=' ', 4=' ', 5='S', 6='#', 7='#'\n\nRow 3: \"# A  SS#\" → 0='#', 1=' ', 2='A', 3=' ', 4='S', 5='S', 6='#', 7='#'\n\nRow 4: \"#    S #\" → 0='#', 1=' ', 2=' ', 3=' ', 4='S', 5=' ', 6='#', 7='#'\n\nRow 5: \"#    S #\" → 0='#', 1=' ', 2=' ', 3=' ', 4='S', 5=' ', 6='#', 7='#'\n\nRow 6: \"#A  SS #\" → 0='#', 1='A', 2=' ', 3=' ', 4='S', 5='S', 6='#', 7='#'\n\nSo head position (row 1, column 1). Let's check possible moves:\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So possible directions (can't reverse to RIGHT). So possible next directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n- LEFT: (1,0) → wall → die.\n- UP: (0,1) → wall → die.\n- DOWN: (2,1) → let's check (row 2, column 1). Row 2's index 1 is ' ' (space). So that's a valid cell. Now, we need to check if that cell is part of the snake's body. The body segments are all 'S's. Let's list all the S positions:\n\nRow 1, columns 2-5: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nRow 2, column 5: (2,5)\n\nRow 3, columns 4-5: (3,4), (3,5)\n\nRow 4, column 4: (4,4)\n\nRow 5, column 4: (5,4)\n\nRow 6, columns 4-5: (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo (2,1) is (row 2, column 1) → that's a ' ' (empty), not part of the body. So moving DOWN would be safe. Then, after moving, the head would be at (2,1). Now, check if that cell has an apple. Let's check row 2, column 1: it's a space, no. The apples are in row 2, column 2 (A), row 3, column 2 (A), row 6, column 1 (A). So (2,1) is not an apple, so the snake doesn't grow. The body will shift: the tail (the last S) would be removed. Wait, but when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward. So the new head is (2,1), and the body follows. The previous head (1,1) becomes S, and the tail (which is the last S) is removed. Let's see the current body:\n\nThe snake's body is a sequence. The head is at (1,1). The body segments are in order. Since the snake is moving LEFT, the body would be trailing to the right. So the body segments are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) — but maybe I need to reconstruct the snake's path.\n\nAlternatively, the snake's length can be determined by the number of S and H. Let's count: H is 1, S's:\n\nRow 1: 4 S's (columns 2-5)\nRow 2: 1 S (column 5)\nRow 3: 2 S's (columns 4-5)\nRow 4: 1 S (column 4)\nRow 5: 1 S (column 4)\nRow 6: 2 S's (columns 4-5)\nTotal S's: 4+1+2+1+1+2=11. So total length is 1 (H) + 11 (S) = 12. So when moving, if no apple is eaten, the tail (the last S) is removed, so the length remains 12.\n\nSo if direction is DOWN, the head moves to (2,1). The next positions of the body would be: previous head (1,1) becomes S, then the rest of the body follows. The tail (the last S) would be removed. Let's check if (2,1) is safe. Since it's not a wall and not part of the body, it's safe. So moving DOWN is a valid option.\n\nWhat about direction RIGHT? Wait, the current direction is LEFT, so reversing to RIGHT is not allowed. Because the rule says \"the snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly)\". So RIGHT is a reverse of LEFT, so it's not allowed. So direction RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo the only possible valid direction is DOWN. Because UP and LEFT would hit walls, RIGHT is reversed direction (invalid). So the answer should be DOWN.\n\n\n########\n# HSSSS#\n# A   S#\n# A  SS#\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#A  SS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 1, column 1) (0-indexed).  \n2. **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so RIGHT is invalid.  \n3. **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed).  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1,1) leads to (1,0), which is a wall (`#`). Collision with the wall ends the game. **Invalid**.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP from (1,1) leads to (0,1), which is a wall (`#`). Collision with the wall ends the game. **Invalid**.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,1) leads to (2,1). Checking (2,1) on the board: it is an empty space (` `) and not part of the snake’s body (all 'S' positions are elsewhere). This move is safe and does not cause collision. **Valid**.  \n\nThus, the only safe direction is DOWN.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as per the problem statement.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# HA  S#\n# A  SS#\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#A  SS #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, and the current epoch is 30. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. The snake can't reverse direction, so since it's currently moving DOWN, the next direction can't be UP. The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since reversing to UP is not allowed).\n\nFirst, I need to find the position of the head 'H'. Let's look at each row:\n\nRow 1 (0-based index 1): # SSSSS# → no H here.\nRow 2 (index 2): # HA  S# → H is here. Let's check the columns. The row is \"# H A  S#\", so the H is at position (2, 1) (row 2, column 1, assuming rows start at 0 and columns start at 0). Wait, let's count the columns properly. Let's index rows from 0 to 7 (since it's 8x8). The first row (index 0) is ######## (columns 0-7). Then row 1 (index 1): # SSSSS# → columns 0 is '#', column 1 is 'S', columns 2-5 are 'S's, column 6 is 'S', column 7 is '#'. So row 1: columns 1-6 are SSSSS.\n\nRow 2 (index 2): # HA  S# → columns 0: '#', column 1: 'H', column 2: 'A', columns 3-4: ' ', column 5: 'S', column 6: ' ', column 7: '#'? Wait, let's parse each character in row 2. The row is \"# H A  S#\" (assuming the input is as given). Let's list each column (0-7):\n\nRow 2 (index 2):\ncolumns 0: '#'\ncolumn 1: 'H'\ncolumn 2: 'A'\ncolumn 3: ' ' (space)\ncolumn 4: ' ' (space)\ncolumn 5: 'S'\ncolumn 6: ' ' (space)\ncolumn 7: '#'\n\nWait, perhaps I should write each row as a string and index them. Let's list all rows properly:\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7: all '#')\nRow 1: # SSSSS# → columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'? Wait, the original input says \"Game board:\" followed by the board. Let's take the exact rows:\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: # SSSSS#\nRow 2: # HA  S#\nRow 3: # A  SS#\nRow 4: #    S #\nRow 5: #    S #\nRow 6: #A  SS #\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo, each row is 8 characters long. Let's index each cell as (row, column), where row and column start at 0.\n\nRow 0: (0,0)-(0,7) are all '#'\nRow 1: (1,0)='#', (1,1)=' ', (1,2)='S', (1,3)='S', (1,4)='S', (1,5)='S', (1,6)='S', (1,7)='#'? Wait, no. Let's check the exact string. The second row (row 1) is \"# SSSSS#\". Let's split into each character:\n\nRow 1: [ '#', ' ', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S', '#' ] → columns 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2-5 are 'S's, 6 is 'S', 7 is '#'. So (1,2) to (1,6) are 'S's.\n\nRow 2: \"# HA  S#\" → characters are [ '#', ' ', 'H', 'A', ' ', ' ', 'S', '#' ] → Wait, no. Let's check again. The row is \"# HA  S#\". Let's count each character:\n\nIndex 0: '#'\nIndex 1: ' ' (space)\nIndex 2: 'H' (head)\nIndex 3: 'A' (apple)\nIndex 4: ' ' (space)\nIndex 5: ' ' (space)\nIndex 6: 'S' (body)\nIndex 7: '#'\n\nSo (2,2) is 'H' (head position). That makes sense. Because the snake is moving down, and the current direction is DOWN, the next move would be to the cell below the head (row 3, column 2).\n\nLet's confirm the head's position. Let's check all rows for 'H'. The only 'H' is in row 2. So row 2, column 2 is 'H' (since the row is \"# HA  S#\" → breaking it down: characters are [ '#', ' ', 'H', 'A', ' ', ' ', 'S', '#' ] → so (2,2) is 'H'.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So the next cell the head would move to is (3, 2) (row 3, column 2). Let's check what's in (3,2). Row 3 is \"# A  SS#\". Let's split row 3:\n\nRow 3: [ '#', ' ', 'A', ' ', ' ', 'S', 'S', '#' ] → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'\n\nSo (3,2) is 'A' (an apple). If the snake moves DOWN (current direction), it will move to (3,2), which is an apple. Eating the apple would make the snake grow. The snake's length increases, so the body will extend. The new head would be at (3,2), and the previous head (2,2) becomes part of the body.\n\nBut wait, what about the other possible directions? The snake can choose to turn LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. Since the current direction is DOWN, it can't go UP. Let's check possible directions:\n\n1. DOWN: next position (3,2). What's there? 'A' (apple). So eating the apple. No collision (since (3,2) is an apple, not a wall or body). So this is safe.\n\n2. LEFT: direction LEFT. The next position would be (2,1) (since current head is (2,2), moving left is column 1). Let's check (2,1): in row 2, column 1 is ' ' (space), as per row 2's breakdown [ '#', ' ', 'H', 'A', ... ] → (2,1) is ' '. So moving left would take the head to (2,1). Is that a valid cell? (2,1) is within the board (rows 0-7, columns 0-7; row 2, column 1 is within 1-6, since walls are at 0 and 7). So no wall collision. Is (2,1) part of the snake's body? Let's check if (2,1) is 'S'. The snake's body is 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: # SSSSS# → (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) are 'S's.\n\nRow 2: # HA  S# → (2,6) is 'S'.\n\nRow 3: # A  SS# → (3,5), (3,6) are 'S's.\n\nRow 4: #    S # → (4,5) is 'S'.\n\nRow 5: #    S # → (5,5) is 'S'.\n\nRow 6: #A  SS # → (6,4), (6,5) are 'S's.\n\nSo (2,1) is ' ' (not S), so moving left to (2,1) is safe.\n\n3. RIGHT: direction RIGHT. Next position is (2,3) (current head (2,2), right is column 3). (2,3) is 'A' (from row 2's breakdown: (2,3) is 'A'). So moving right would take the head to (2,3), which is an apple. That's also safe (no collision). So (2,3) is 'A', so eating that apple.\n\nNow, the problem is to choose the best direction. The snake's goal is to eat as many apples as possible. Let's check the positions of all apples. The current apples are 'A's on the board. Let's list all 'A's:\n\nRow 2, column 3: (2,3) → 'A'.\n\nRow 3, column 2: (3,2) → 'A'.\n\nRow 6, column 1: (6,1) → 'A' (row 6 is \"#A  SS #\", which is [ '#', 'A', ' ', ' ', 'S', 'S', ' ', '#' ] → (6,1) is 'A').\n\nSo there are three apples.\n\nCurrent head is at (2,2). Let's check the possible moves:\n\n- Moving DOWN (current direction) to (3,2): that's an apple. So that's good. After moving down, the new head is (3,2) (apple), so the snake grows. The body would now include the previous head (2,2) as 'S', and the rest of the body follows.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,1): that's a space. No apple, so no growth. But safe.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,3): that's an apple. So that's also good.\n\nSo moving RIGHT or DOWN would let the snake eat an apple. Which is better? Let's check if there's any collision risk in the next steps.\n\nIf we move RIGHT (to (2,3)):\n\nNext head position is (2,3) (which is 'A'). After eating, the snake's head is there, and the body would have (2,2) as 'S'. Then, the next direction can't be LEFT (since the new direction would be RIGHT, so reversing would be LEFT, which is not allowed). So next possible directions would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nBut what's the position after moving RIGHT. Let's see the next possible moves. But perhaps more importantly, moving RIGHT is possible, and that's an apple.\n\nIf we move DOWN (to (3,2)):\n\nThat's an apple. Then the next direction could be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. The next position would be (4,2). Let's check (4,2): row 4 is \"#    S #\", which is [ '#', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'S', ' ', '#' ] → (4,2) is ' ' (space). So moving down again would be safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT (to (2,3)): the next direction (if we choose RIGHT again) would take us to (2,4), which is a space. But (2,4) is ' ' (from row 2: (2,4) is ' '). So that's safe.\n\nBut perhaps the best immediate choice is to eat an apple. Both RIGHT and DOWN directions lead to apples. Which one is better? Let's check if there's any body in the way.\n\nIf we move RIGHT (to (2,3)), is there any body in (2,3)? No, it's an apple, so that's safe.\n\nIf we move DOWN (to (3,2)), that's an apple, and (3,2) is not part of the body.\n\nSo both directions are safe and lead to eating an apple. But the problem is to choose one. Let's see if there's any other factors, like the snake's body positions to avoid future collisions.\n\nLooking at the current body positions. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) → SSSSS.\n\nRow 2: (2,6) → S.\n\nRow 3: (3,5), (3,6) → SS.\n\nRow 4: (4,5) → S.\n\nRow 5: (5,5) → S.\n\nRow 6: (6,4), (6,5) → SS.\n\nSo the body is mostly along the right side (columns 5-6 in rows 1-6, and some in row 1 columns 2-5).\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT (to (2,3)), the next position is (2,3) (apple). Then, the next possible directions (since direction would now be RIGHT) could be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Let's say the next move is RIGHT again: (2,4), which is space. Then (2,5): which in row 2, column 5 is ' ' (since row 2 is \"# HA  S#\" → column 5 is ' '). So (2,5) is safe. Then (2,6) is 'S' (body), so can't go there. So if the snake moves right, it has space to move.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN (to (3,2)), the next position (3,2) is apple. Then, moving down again would take to (4,2), which is space, then (5,2) (row 5: \"#    S #\" → column 2 is ' '), (6,2) (row 6: \"#A  SS #\" → column 2 is ' '). So that's a path downwards with space.\n\nBut both options are valid. Since the current direction is DOWN, and moving DOWN is allowed (no reversal), and moving DOWN leads to an apple, that's a good choice. Alternatively, moving RIGHT (which is a turn from DOWN) is allowed (since you can turn left or right, just not reverse).\n\nBut the problem is to choose the best direction. Since both directions lead to apples, perhaps either is acceptable. However, perhaps moving DOWN is better because it's the current direction, and the next cell (3,2) is an apple. Let's confirm the positions again.\n\nCurrent head at (2,2). Moving DOWN (current direction) → (3,2). (3,2) is 'A' (from row 3: \"# A  SS#\" → column 2 is 'A'). So yes, that's correct. So moving DOWN would result in eating the apple. That's a valid and safe move. So the answer would be DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# HA  S#\n# A  SS#\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#A  SS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is located at row 2, column 2 (0-based index). The current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP. The possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\nAnalyzing the next positions for each possible direction:\n- **DOWN**: The next position is (3, 2). Checking row 3 (\"# A  SS#\"), column 2 is 'A' (an apple). Moving DOWN here is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body) and will allow the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score.\n- **LEFT**: The next position is (2, 1). This cell is empty (' '), so no apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.\n- **RIGHT**: The next position is (2, 3). This cell is 'A' (an apple), so eating it is possible, but moving RIGHT requires a turn from the current direction (DOWN), which is allowed. However, moving DOWN (current direction) directly leads to an apple without needing to change direction.\n\nSince moving DOWN (current direction) safely leads to an apple, it is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S', and apples are 'A'. The current direction is DOWN, and the epoch is 31, which is well before the 100th epoch, so the game isn't ending yet.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the snake's head. Let's parse the board row by row. The rows are:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# → positions (1,1) to (1,6) are ' ', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S'\nRow 2: # SA  S# → (2,1) 'S', (2,2) 'A', (2,3) ' ', (2,4) ' ', (2,5) 'S'\nRow 3: # H  SS# → (3,1) 'H', (3,2) ' ', (3,3) ' ', (3,4) 'S', (3,5) 'S'\nRow 4: #    S # → (4,1) ' ', (4,2) ' ', (4,3) ' ', (4,4) 'S', (4,5) ' '\nRow 5: #    SA# → (5,1) ' ', (5,2) ' ', (5,3) ' ', (5,4) 'S', (5,5) 'A'\nRow 6: #A  SS # → (6,1) 'A', (6,2) ' ', (6,3) ' ', (6,4) 'S', (6,5) 'S'\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at position (3,1) (row 3, column 1; assuming rows are 0-indexed from top to bottom, columns 0-indexed from left to right). The current direction is DOWN, so the snake is moving down. Let's confirm the direction: moving DOWN from (3,1) would take the head to (4,1) next.\n\nNow, the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is DOWN, so the snake can't go UP (since that's the opposite). The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n\nWe need to check where the next position would be for each possible direction and see if it's safe (no collision with walls or own body) and if there's an apple to eat.\n\nLet's list possible directions:\n\n1. Current direction is DOWN. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (can't go UP, which is opposite).\n\nFirst, let's check each possible next move:\n\nCase 1: Direction DOWN. Next head position is (4,1). Let's check what's at (4,1). Looking at row 4: #    S # → columns 0 is '#', column 1 is ' ', column 2 ' ', column 3 ' ', column 4 'S', column 5 ' ', column 6 '#'. So (4,1) is ' ' (empty). So that's safe. The body will follow. But no apple here.\n\nCase 2: Direction LEFT. Next head position is (3,0). But column 0 is a wall ('#'), since all rows start and end with '#'. So (3,0) is a wall. Collision! So LEFT is invalid.\n\nCase 3: Direction RIGHT. Next head position is (3,2). Let's check (3,2) in row 3: # H  SS# → after H (column 1), column 2 is ' ', column 3 is ' ', then S at 4 and 5. So (3,2) is ' ' (empty). Safe. No apple here.\n\nCase 4: Direction UP (invalid, since current direction is DOWN, can't reverse). So UP is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's check if any of the possible directions lead to an apple. The apples are at:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 2, column 2: 'A' (position (2,2))\nRow 5, column 5: 'A' (position (5,5))\nRow 6, column 1: 'A' (position (6,1))\n\nSo current head is at (3,1). Let's see possible next positions and if they have apples.\n\nFor direction DOWN: (4,1) → ' ' (no apple)\nDirection RIGHT: (3,2) → ' ' (no apple)\nDirection LEFT: (3,0) → wall (invalid)\nSo none of the immediate next moves have apples. So the priority is to avoid collision and choose a direction that allows the snake to move towards apples without hitting itself or walls.\n\nNow, let's check the snake's body positions to avoid collision. The body is 'S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) → columns 1-5 in row 1.\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,5) → column 1 and 5.\nRow 3: (3,4), (3,5) → columns 4 and 5.\nRow 4: (4,4) → column 4.\nRow 5: (4,4) → wait, row 5 is #    SA# → (5,4) is 'S', (5,5) 'A'.\nRow 6: (6,4), (6,5) → columns 4 and 5.\n\nSo S positions are:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5),\n(2,1), (2,5),\n(3,4), (3,5),\n(4,4),\n(5,4),\n(6,4), (6,5)\n\nNow, the current head is at (3,1). The snake's movement: when moving, the head moves to the new position, and the body follows (each body segment moves to the position of the previous one). So, after moving, the new head is the new position, and the tail (the last S) might be removed unless the snake ate an apple (which increases length, so tail stays). Since in this case, none of the next positions have apples, the tail will move (so the last S is removed).\n\nBut for collision detection, the next head position must not be a wall or any S (except possibly the tail, which would be moving away if no apple is eaten).\n\nLet's check each possible direction again:\n\nDirection DOWN: next head (4,1). Check if (4,1) is a wall or S. (4,1) is ' ' (from row 4: #    S # → columns 1 is ' '). So safe.\n\nDirection RIGHT: next head (3,2). (3,2) is ' ' (from row 3: # H  SS# → H is at 1, so 2 is ' '). Safe.\n\nDirection LEFT: (3,0) is wall. Not allowed.\n\nSo both DOWN and RIGHT are possible. Now, which is better? Let's think about the snake's path and possible future moves. The snake is currently moving DOWN. Let's see where moving DOWN would take it next. If we go DOWN to (4,1), then next possible directions (since current direction would then be DOWN) could be DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n(4,1) is in row 4, column 1. Let's check the adjacent cells from (4,1):\n\nDown would be (5,1). Let's check (5,1) in row 5: #    SA# → column 1 is ' ', so safe.\n\nRight would be (4,2), which is ' ' (row 4: #    S # → column 2 is ' ').\n\nLeft would be (4,0), which is a wall (column 0 is '#').\n\nIf we go RIGHT from current head (3,1) to (3,2), then the new direction is RIGHT (since the direction input is RIGHT). Then next move's possible directions would be RIGHT, UP, DOWN (can't go LEFT, which is opposite of RIGHT).\n\nBut we need to check if moving RIGHT now would lead to a position that's safe. (3,2) is safe. Then, the next possible moves from (3,2) would be in direction RIGHT (to (3,3)), UP (to (2,2)), or DOWN (to (4,2)).\n\nLooking at (2,2): that's an apple! (Row 2, column 2 is 'A'). So if after moving RIGHT to (3,2), the next direction could be UP to (2,2), which has an apple. That's a good path.\n\nWait, let's map this out. Current head (3,1), direction DOWN. If we choose RIGHT now, the head moves to (3,2), direction becomes RIGHT (since that's the input direction). Then, the next move's possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN (can't go LEFT). If the next move is UP (from (3,2)), the head would go to (2,2), which is the apple 'A'. That would be a good move, as eating the apple would increase the score and the snake would grow.\n\nAlternatively, if we go DOWN to (4,1) now, then the direction remains DOWN (if we input DOWN again). Then, the next head position would be (5,1). From (5,1), possible directions are DOWN (to (6,1), which is an 'A'!), RIGHT (to (5,2)), or LEFT (wall). So (6,1) is an apple. Let's check:\n\nCurrent head (3,1) → move DOWN to (4,1) (direction DOWN). Then, next move could be DOWN again to (5,1), then again DOWN to (6,1), which is 'A'. So that's another path to an apple.\n\nSo there are two possible paths to apples. Let's check the steps:\n\nPath 1: RIGHT now → (3,2) → then UP to (2,2) (apple).\n\nPath 2: DOWN now → (4,1) → DOWN to (5,1) → DOWN to (6,1) (apple).\n\nLet's check if these paths are possible (no collisions).\n\nPath 1:\n\nCurrent head (3,1) → move RIGHT to (3,2). Check (3,2) is ' ', safe.\n\nThen, direction is RIGHT. Next move, if we choose UP (since direction can be changed to UP, as current direction is RIGHT; can't reverse to LEFT). So moving UP from (3,2) would take head to (2,2). What's (2,2)? It's 'A' (apple). So that's good. The position (2,2) is empty except for the apple, so no collision. So that's safe.\n\nPath 2:\n\nCurrent head (3,1) → move DOWN to (4,1). (4,1) is ' ', safe.\n\nThen, direction is DOWN. Next move, move DOWN to (5,1). (5,1) is ' ', safe.\n\nThen, move DOWN to (6,1). (6,1) is 'A' (apple). Safe, as (6,1) is not a wall and not a body part. The S's in row 6 are at (6,4) and (6,5), so (6,1) is 'A', so no collision.\n\nSo both paths are possible. Now, which is better? Let's check the current positions.\n\nIf we go RIGHT now, then (3,2) is safe. Then, moving UP to (2,2) (apple) would be a shorter path (2 moves to apple). Whereas moving DOWN would take 3 moves (current move DOWN, next DOWN, next DOWN) to reach (6,1) apple.\n\nSo the RIGHT direction now allows reaching an apple in the next move (if we choose UP next). So perhaps choosing RIGHT now is better.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if there's any immediate danger. Let's see the snake's body. The body is in various positions, but the head is at (3,1), which is in the lower part of the snake's body. The snake's body seems to be forming a sort of loop or a line. Let's make sure that moving in either direction doesn't lead to a collision with the body in the next steps.\n\nFor direction RIGHT (next head at (3,2)): (3,2) is empty, so no collision. The body parts are at (3,4), (3,5), so (3,2) is safe.\n\nFor direction DOWN (next head at (4,1)): (4,1) is empty. The body parts in row 4 are at (4,4), so (4,1) is safe.\n\nSo both directions are safe. Now, which direction allows the snake to reach an apple sooner?\n\nThe apple at (2,2) is in row 2, column 2. If we go RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (2,2) (next move) would reach the apple. That's 2 steps (current move RIGHT, next move UP).\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is in row 6, column 1. If we go DOWN three times (current move DOWN to (4,1), next move DOWN to (5,1), next move DOWN to (6,1)), that's 3 steps. So the apple at (2,2) is closer.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT now would allow the snake to get to an apple faster.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's current direction is DOWN, and if we choose RIGHT, the direction changes to RIGHT, which is allowed (since it's not the reverse direction). So that's a valid move.\n\nSo the best direction here is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SA  S#\n# H  SS#\n#    S #\n#    SA#\n#A  SS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current position, possible moves, and apple locations:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (3,1) (row 3, column 1).  \n2. **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid).  \n3. **Possible Directions**: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: Next position would be (3,0), which is a wall ('#'). Collision. Invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Next position is (4,1). This cell is empty (' '), so safe but no apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: Next position is (3,2). This cell is empty (' '), so safe.  \n\n### Apple Locations:\nApples are at (2,2), (5,5), and (6,1).  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nMoving RIGHT to (3,2) positions the snake to reach the nearest apple at (2,2) in the next move (by turning UP). This path is shorter (2 steps to apple) compared to moving DOWN (3 steps to apple at (6,1)).  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). The snake's head is 'H', body parts are 'S', apples are 'A'. The current direction is RIGHT, and the epoch is 32 (so we have 68 more epochs before the game ends). The snake can't reverse direction, so from RIGHT, it can't go LEFT. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n\nFirst, let's map out the current positions. Let's index the rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7), and columns 0 (left) to 7 (right).\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# → columns 1-5 are S, column 6 is S, column 7 is #. So positions (1,1) to (1,6) are S.\nRow 2: # SA  S# → columns 1: S, 2: A, 3: space, 4: space, 5: S, 6: #. So (2,1)=S, (2,2)=A, (2,5)=S.\nRow 3: # SH SS# → columns 1: S, 2: H (head), 3: S, 4: S, 5: S, 6: #. So (3,1)=S, (3,2)=H, (3,3)=S, (3,4)=S, (3,5)=S.\nRow 4: #    S # → columns 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: S, 5: space, 6: #. So (4,4)=S.\nRow 5: #    SA# → columns 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: S, 5: A, 6: #. So (4,4)=S (from row 4), (5,4)=S, (5,5)=A.\nRow 6: #A   S # → columns 1: A, 2: space, 3: space, 4: S, 5: space, 6: #. So (6,1)=A, (6,4)=S.\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the head (H) is at position (3,2). The current direction is RIGHT, so the next move would be to (3,3) if we keep moving RIGHT. Let's check where that is. The current cell to the right of H (3,2) is (3,3), which is S (snake's body). Oh, that's a problem! If the snake moves RIGHT, the head would go into (3,3), which is part of the body. That's a collision, so the game would end. So moving RIGHT is definitely bad.\n\nSo the possible directions are UP or DOWN (since can't reverse to LEFT). Let's check those.\n\nFirst, direction UP: moving from (3,2) up would be (2,2). Let's check what's there. Row 2, column 2 is A (apple). Oh, that's good. So if we move UP, the head goes to (2,2) which is an apple. Then, the snake would eat the apple, grow, and the apple is replaced (but the example shows that after eating, the new head is there and the body follows). Let's confirm. The current head is (3,2). Moving UP to (2,2) which is A. So the snake's head moves there, eats the apple, grows. The body parts would shift: the previous head (3,2) becomes S, and the new head is (2,2). So that's safe. No collision with walls (since row 2 is within 1-6, column 2 is 1-6). No collision with body, because (2,2) is A, not S. So UP is a valid direction.\n\nNow direction DOWN: moving from (3,2) down to (4,2). Let's check (4,2). Row 4, column 2 is a space (since row 4 is \"#    S #\", so columns 1-3 are spaces, 4 is S). So (4,2) is empty. So moving DOWN would take the head to (4,2), which is safe (no collision). But there's no apple there, so the snake doesn't grow, but the game continues. However, we need to check if moving DOWN leads to any potential issues. Let's see the snake's body. The current body is in various positions. The head's current position is (3,2). The body parts are (3,1), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) (from row 3), (1,1-6), (2,1), (2,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4). So (4,2) is empty, so moving there is safe. But the question is, which direction gives a better chance to eat apples and avoid collision.\n\nWe need to check the positions of the apples. The apples are at (2,2), (5,5), (6,1). Let's list them:\n\n- (2,2) → current position if moving UP.\n- (5,5) → in row 5, column 5.\n- (6,1) → row 6, column 1.\n\nIf we move UP, we eat the apple at (2,2), which is good. That increases the score and the snake grows. That's better than moving DOWN, which doesn't get an apple. Also, moving RIGHT is a collision, so that's invalid. So the best option is UP.\n\nWait, but let's confirm the movement again. The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake can turn UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (but RIGHT is into the body). So possible directions are UP or DOWN.\n\nMoving UP: (3,2) → (2,2) (A). That's safe. So that's a valid move. So the answer should be UP.\n\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SA  S#\n# SH SS#\n#    S #\n#    SA#\n#A   S #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 3, column 2).  \n2. **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT is invalid.  \n3. **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (but RIGHT leads to collision).  \n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 3, column 3), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a self-collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (row 2, column 2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is safe (no collision with walls or body), increases the score by 1, and allows the snake to grow. **Valid and beneficial**.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (row 4, column 2), which is empty. This avoids collision but does not eat an apple. While valid, it is less optimal than UP.  \n\nThe best move is to go UP, as it safely eats an apple and avoids immediate collision.  \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S', apples are 'A'. The current direction is UP, and the epoch is 33, so we have 67 epochs left before the game ends.\n\nFirst, let's parse the board row by row. The rows are:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# (columns 1-6: positions 1 has ' ', 2-6: 'SSSSS')\nRow 2: # SH  S# (columns 1-6: 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'H', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: 'S')\nRow 3: # SS SS# (columns 1-6: 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: 'S')\nRow 4: #    S # (columns 1-6: 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ')\nRow 5: #  A SA# (columns 1-6: 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: 'A')\nRow 6: #A   S # (columns 1-6: 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at row 2, column 3 (since rows are 0-indexed, and columns 1-6 are the play area). Let's confirm that. Row 2 is \"# SH  S#\", so the characters are: index 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'H', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: 'S', 7: '#'. So H is at (row 2, column 3).\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving UP, so the next position the head will move to is (row 2 - 1, column 3) = (row 1, column 3). Let's check what's in row 1, column 3. Row 1 is \"# SSSSS#\", so columns 1-6 are ' ', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S'. So row 1, column 3 (since columns are 0-based, the positions in the row are 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'). So row 1, column 3 is 'S' (the snake's body). If the snake moves UP, the head will collide with its own body, which ends the game. So moving UP is bad.\n\nSo the snake can't go UP (current direction), but wait, the player can change direction as long as it's not reversing. The current direction is UP, so the snake can't reverse to DOWN. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP (but UP leads to collision). So we need to check possible directions.\n\nLet's list possible directions:\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake can turn to LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP. It cannot turn to DOWN (reverse).\n\nSo possible directions to choose: LEFT, RIGHT, UP. But we need to check where each direction leads.\n\nFirst, current head position is (row 2, column 3). Let's note the coordinates as (r, c), where r is row (0-7), c is column (0-7). The head is at (2,3).\n\nPossible next positions based on direction:\n\n- UP: (2-1, 3) = (1,3). As before, (1,3) is 'S' (body). Collision, game over. So UP is invalid.\n\n- DOWN: (2+1, 3) = (3,3). But direction is current UP, so can't reverse to DOWN. So direction DOWN is not allowed.\n\n- LEFT: (2, 3-1) = (2,2). What's at (2,2)? Row 2 is \"# SH  S#\", so column 2 is 'S' (since row 2's characters are 0:'#', 1:' ', 2:'S', 3:'H', 4:' ', 5:' ', 6:'S', 7:'#'). So (2,2) is 'S' (body). If the snake turns LEFT, the head moves to (2,2), which is body. Collision. So LEFT is bad.\n\n- RIGHT: (2, 3+1) = (2,4). Let's check (2,4). Row 2's column 4 is ' ' (since row 2 is \"# SH  S#\", column 4 is the 5th character, which is ' '). So (2,4) is empty. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,4), which is safe. Then, the snake's body would follow. Since the snake is moving, each body part moves to the position of the previous part.\n\nNow, after moving RIGHT, we need to check if there's an apple in that position. (2,4) is ' ', so no apple. So the snake's length remains the same, and the body shifts. The new head is (2,4), and the rest of the body follows.\n\nBut wait, what about other possible directions? Let's confirm again.\n\nCurrent head position: (2,3). Let's confirm all four directions:\n\nUP: (1,3) → 'S' (body) → collision.\n\nDOWN: (3,3) → check row 3: \"# SS SS#\". Columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'. So (3,3) is 'S' (body). So even if we could go DOWN (which we can't, because current direction is UP, so reversing is not allowed), moving DOWN would hit body.\n\nLEFT: (2,2) → 'S' (body) → collision.\n\nRIGHT: (2,4) → ' ' → safe.\n\nSo the only possible direction that doesn't cause collision is RIGHT. Because all other directions (UP, LEFT) lead to body collision, and DOWN is reverse direction (not allowed).\n\nTherefore, the correct direction to choose is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SH  S#\n# SS SS#\n#    S #\n#  A SA#\n#A   S #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at (row 2, column 3). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. We need to check possible directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) to avoid collision.\n\n- **UP**: Next position (row 1, column 3) is 'S' (snake's body), causing collision. Invalid.\n- **LEFT**: Next position (row 2, column 2) is 'S' (snake's body), causing collision. Invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Next position (row 2, column 4) is empty (' '), safe to move. No collision.\n\nThe only valid direction is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided. \n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#'. The snake's head is 'H', body segments are 'S', and apples are 'A'. The current direction is RIGHT, and the epoch is 34, so there's still time left before the 100th epoch.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the snake's head. Let's parse the board row by row. The rows are:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# → Let's index from 0, so positions 1-6. So row 1, columns 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'\nRow 2: # SSH S# → columns 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: 'S', 7: '#'\nAh, here's the head! So H is at row 2, column 4 (since rows are 0-7, columns 0-7; the first character in each row is column 0, which is a '#'). So H is (2,4). \n\nRow 3: # SS SS# → columns 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'\nRow 4: #    S # → columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 5: #  A SA# → columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: 'A', 7: '#'\nRow 6: #A     # → columns 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So the snake is moving right. Let's confirm the direction rules: the snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is RIGHT, the next direction can't be LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (but moving in the same direction is allowed).\n\nFirst, we need to check where the head would move if we choose each possible direction, and see if that leads to a collision (with walls or itself), and if it eats an apple.\n\nLet's list possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse, not allowed).\n\nCurrent head position: (2,4) (row 2, column 4). Let's note that in grid terms, rows increase downward, columns increase rightward.\n\nPossible next positions based on direction:\n\n1. UP: moving up would take the head to (1,4) (since row 2-1=1, column 4). Let's check what's at (1,4). Looking at row 1: \"# SSSSS#\" → columns 1-6. Column 4 (since 0 is '#') would be column 4 in row 1. Let's index the row 1 as [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] 'S', [3] 'S', [4] 'S', [5] 'S', [6] 'S', [7] '#'. So row 1, column 4 is 'S' (since [4] is 'S'). So if we move UP, the head would hit a body segment (S), which is a collision. So UP is invalid.\n\n2. DOWN: moving down would take the head to (3,4) (row 2+1=3, column 4). Check row 3: \"# SS SS#\" → columns 1-6. Row 3, column 4: let's index row 3 as [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] 'S', [3] 'S', [4] ' ', [5] 'S', [6] 'S', [7] '#'. So column 4 is ' ' (empty). So (3,4) is empty. That's safe. Now, check if that position has an apple. The cell (3,4) is ' ', so no apple. So moving DOWN would be safe, no collision, no apple eaten.\n\n3. RIGHT: moving right would take the head to (2,5) (row 2, column 4+1=5). Check row 2: \"# SSH S#\" → [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] 'S', [3] 'S', [4] 'H', [5] ' ', [6] 'S', [7] '#'. So column 5 in row 2 is ' ' (since [5] is ' '). So (2,5) is empty. Safe. No apple here. So moving RIGHT would be safe, no collision, no apple.\n\nNow, let's check if there are apples nearby that the snake can reach. Let's list the positions of apples. From the board:\n\nRow 5: \"#  A SA#\" → columns 3 is 'A' (row 5, column 3), column 6 is 'A' (row5, column6).\n\nRow 6: \"#A     #\" → column 1 is 'A' (row6, column1).\n\nSo apples at (5,3), (5,6), (6,1).\n\nNow, the snake's current head is at (2,4). Let's see the possible paths to these apples.\n\nFirst, check the current direction is RIGHT. The snake's body is S's. Let's try to map the snake's body to understand its structure.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: columns 2-6 are SSSSS → (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) are S.\n\nRow 2: columns 2,3,6 are S (since row 2 is \"# SSH S#\", so (2,2), (2,3), (2,6) are S; (2,4) is H.\n\nRow 3: columns 2,3,5,6 are S → (3,2), (3,3), (3,5), (3,6) are S.\n\nRow 4: column 5 is S → (4,5) is S.\n\nRow 5: column 5 is S → (5,5) is S.\n\nSo the snake's body segments are:\n\n(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6),\n\n(2,2), (2,3), (2,6),\n\n(3,2), (3,3), (3,5), (3,6),\n\n(4,5),\n\n(5,5).\n\nThe head is (2,4). The snake's length is 1 (head) plus the number of S's. Let's count S's:\n\nRow 1 has 5 S's (cols 2-6).\n\nRow 2 has 3 S's (cols 2,3,6).\n\nRow 3 has 4 S's (cols 2,3,5,6).\n\nRow 4 has 1 S (col5).\n\nRow5 has 1 S (col5).\n\nTotal S's: 5+3+4+1+1=14. So the snake's length is 14+1=15.\n\nNow, the snake's movement: when moving, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. But since the current direction is RIGHT, and we need to choose the next direction, the key is where the head moves next.\n\nLet's think about possible directions again.\n\nUP: (1,4) is S → collision. So invalid.\n\nDOWN: (3,4) is empty. So the head moves there. Then the body follows. The new head is (3,4), and the previous head (2,4) becomes S, and the rest of the body shifts. So after moving DOWN, the new positions would have (3,4) as H, (2,4) as S, and the rest of the body segments moving.\n\nRIGHT: (2,5) is empty. So head moves to (2,5), (2,4) becomes S, etc.\n\nNow, let's check for possible collisions in the next steps. For example, if we go DOWN, then next possible directions. But perhaps we need to check if moving in a direction leads to a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for apples. The closest apple might be (5,3), (5,6), (6,1). Let's see the positions.\n\nCurrent head (2,4). Let's check (5,3): row 5, column 3. To reach there, the snake would need to move down a few rows. Let's see the path.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN now (current direction is RIGHT, so next direction can be DOWN). Then the head is at (3,4). Then, perhaps next direction could be DOWN again (since current direction would then be DOWN, can't reverse to UP). Let's see:\n\nFrom (3,4), moving DOWN would take to (4,4). Check row 4: \"#    S #\" → column 4 is ' ' (since row 4 is [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] ' ', [3] ' ', [4] ' ', [5] 'S', [6] ' ', [7] '#'). So (4,4) is ' ', safe.\n\nThen (4,4) → moving DOWN to (5,4). Check row 5: \"#  A SA#\" → column 4 is ' ' (row 5 columns: [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] ' ', [3] 'A', [4] ' ', [5] 'S', [6] 'A', [7] '#'). So (5,4) is ' ', safe. Then, moving LEFT (since direction would be DOWN, next direction could be LEFT). From (5,4), moving LEFT to (5,3) which is 'A' (apple). That's a good path. So moving DOWN now could lead to reaching (5,3) apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we move RIGHT now, head to (2,5). Then, possible directions could be DOWN. Let's see (2,5) is the new head. Then, moving DOWN to (3,5). Check row 3, column 5 is 'S' (row 3: \"# SS SS#\", column 5 is 'S' → (3,5) is S. So that's a collision. So moving RIGHT then DOWN would hit the body. So that's bad.\n\nSo moving RIGHT now: new head (2,5). Next possible directions: RIGHT (since current direction would be RIGHT, can't go LEFT). So moving RIGHT again to (2,6). Check row 2, column 6: 'S' (from row 2 \"# SSH S#\", column 6 is 'S'). So (2,6) is S → collision. So moving RIGHT now would lead to (2,5), then if we go RIGHT again, we hit S. Alternatively, moving UP from (2,5) (current direction is RIGHT, so next direction could be UP). Let's check (2,5) moving UP to (1,5). Row 1, column 5 is 'S' (row 1: \"# SSSSS#\", column 5 is 'S') → collision. So moving RIGHT now leads to possible collisions in next steps.\n\nSo moving DOWN now is safer. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head (2,4). Direction DOWN: new head (3,4). What's (3,4)? It's ' ' (from row 3: \"# SS SS#\", column 4 is ' '). So safe. No collision, no apple. Then, in the next step, the direction could be DOWN again (since current direction would be DOWN). Let's check (3,4) moving DOWN to (4,4) (row 4, column 4: ' '). Safe. Then (4,4) moving DOWN to (5,4) (row 5, column 4: ' '). Then (5,4) moving LEFT to (5,3) (which is 'A'). So that's an apple. So this path could get an apple.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,6): (5,6) is 'A'. Let's see if the snake can reach that. Current head (2,4). To get to (5,6), need to move right and down. Let's see. If we go RIGHT, head (2,5). Then RIGHT again (but (2,6) is S → collision). So that's not possible. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (3,4), then RIGHT to (3,5). (3,5) is 'S' (row 3, column 5: 'S') → collision. So that's not possible. So (5,6) is surrounded by S. So maybe that's not reachable.\n\nThe apple at (6,1): (6,1) is 'A'. To reach that, the snake would need to move left and down a lot. But the current head is at (2,4). Moving left from (2,4) would be direction LEFT, which is reverse of current direction (RIGHT), so not allowed. So can't go left now. So perhaps (6,1) is not reachable quickly.\n\nSo the best option is to move DOWN now, which is safe, and allows the snake to proceed towards the apple at (5,3). \n\nOther options: moving RIGHT is possible but may lead to collision in next steps. UP is invalid (collision). So the best direction is DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSH S#\n# SS SS#\n#    S #\n#  A SA#\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and collision risks:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 2, column 4).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT (snake cannot reverse to LEFT).\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 5, column 3), (row 5, column 6), and (row 6, column 1).\n- **Collision Rules**: The game ends if the head hits walls, itself, or exceeds 100 epochs.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: Moving up would take the head to (row 1, column 4), which is occupied by a body segment 'S' → **Collision (invalid)**.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (row 2, column 5), which is empty (' '). However, subsequent moves right would hit a body segment at (row 2, column 6) → **Risky long-term**.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving down takes the head to (row 3, column 4), which is empty (' '). This path avoids collisions and allows the snake to navigate toward the apple at (row 5, column 3) in future steps.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is the safest and most strategic choice, avoiding immediate collisions and enabling progress toward an apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSS S#\n# SSHSS#\n#    S #\n#  A  A#\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, and the current epoch is 35. The snake is moving down, and we need to choose the next direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) without reversing. Since the current direction is DOWN, reversing would be UP, so we can't choose UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n\nFirst, let's locate the snake's head. The head is 'H'. Looking at the board, the third row (since rows are 0-based or 1-based? Let's check the example. In the example, the first line is ########, which is the top wall. So rows are from top to bottom. Let's index rows 0 to 7 (since 8x8).\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# → columns 1-6: S S S S S\nRow 2: # SSS S# → columns 1-6: S S S  S (maybe column 4 is empty? Let's see: positions 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4: (space), 5:S)\nRow 3: # SSHSS# → columns 1-6: S S H S S → So H is at row 3, column 3 (since 0-based, columns 1 is index 1, so row 3, column 3 is H)\nRow 4: #    S # → columns 1-6: (space, space, space, S, space) → column 4 has S\nRow 5: #  A  A# → columns 2 and 5 are A (positions 2 and 5)\nRow 6: #A     # → column 1 is A\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo head position is (row 3, column 3). The current direction is DOWN, so the next position if moving DOWN would be row 4, column 3. Let's check what's there. Row 4 is \"#    S #\". Let's split row 4: index 0 is '#', then columns 1-6. So row 4, column 3 (since 0-based, row 3's H is (3,3)): row 4, column 3 is the 4th character (since 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: '#'). Wait, let's count:\n\nRow 4: \"#    S #\" → characters are [0]'#', [1]' ', [2]' ', [3]' ', [4]'S', [5]' ', [6]'#'. So (row 4, column 3) is ' ' (space). Because column 3 is index 3, which is a space. So if moving DOWN, the new head position is (4,3). Is that safe? Let's check if that's a wall or body.\n\nThe new head position (4,3) is a space, so no collision. Then, the snake moves. But we need to check if there's an apple there. The apple positions are in row 5 (columns 2 and 5) and row 6 (column 1). So (4,3) is not an apple, so the snake doesn't grow. The body would follow: since the snake's length is the number of 'S' and 'H'. Let's count the current snake body.\n\nRow 1: 5 S's (columns 1-5: SSSSS)\nRow 2: SSS S → columns 1-3 (S S S), column 5 (S) → 4 S's\nRow 3: SSHSS → columns 1-2 (S S), H, columns 4-5 (S S) → 4 S's (excluding H)\nRow 4: S → column 4 (S)\nTotal S's: 5 + 4 +4 +1 = 14. H is 1, so total length is 15. So when moving, the tail (last S) would be removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nBut the main thing is to avoid collision. Let's check possible directions:\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (can't go UP, which is reverse).\n\nOption 1: Continue DOWN. Next head position (4,3). Check if that's a wall or body. (4,3) is a space. So safe.\n\nOption 2: Turn LEFT. Direction LEFT. The head (3,3) would move to (3,2). Let's check (3,2) → row 3 is \"# SSHSS#\". Columns 1-6: [1]S, [2]S, [3]H, [4]S, [5]S. So (3,2) is 'S' (since column 2 is S). That's the snake's body. So moving LEFT would cause collision with self. So invalid.\n\nOption 3: Turn RIGHT. Direction RIGHT. Head (3,3) moves to (3,4). Check (3,4) → row 3, column 4. Row 3 is \"# SSHSS#\", so column 4 is S. So (3,4) is 'S' → collision with body. So invalid.\n\nSo the only possible direction is DOWN. Because LEFT and RIGHT would hit the body, and UP is reverse (not allowed). So the snake must continue moving DOWN. Let's confirm:\n\nIf direction is DOWN, new head is (4,3) (row 4, column 3). The current row 4 has \"#    S #\". So (4,3) is ' ', which is safe. So the snake moves there. The tail (the end of the snake) would move. The snake's body is a chain, so the movement would shift each part. Since no apple is eaten, the tail (the last S) is removed. But the main thing is that the move is safe. So the correct direction is DOWN.\n\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSS S#\n# SSHSS#\n#    S #\n#  A  A#\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at row 3, column 3 (0-based indexing).\n- Current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP.\n- Possible directions: DOWN (continue), LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of directions:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (3, 2). Checking row 3 (\"# SSHSS#\"), column 2 is 'S' (snake's body). Collision with self → invalid.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3, 4). Checking row 3, column 4 is 'S' (snake's body). Collision with self → invalid.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (4, 3). Row 4 (\"#    S #\") has a space (' ') at column 3, which is safe (no wall or body collision). This direction is valid.\n\nThus, the only safe direction is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to look at the current game board and the current direction. The snake is currently moving DOWN, and the epoch is 36, which is well before 100, so the game isn't ending yet. \n\nLet me start by visualizing the game board. The board is 8x8, with walls as '#'. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSSS#\nRow 2: # SSS S#\nRow 3: # SSSSS#\nRow 4: #   H  # (here, the head 'H' is in row 4, probably column 4 since it's \"  H  \" which is positions 2,3,4,5 maybe. Let's check: \"  H  \" would be positions 2 (space), 3 (space), 4 (H), 5 (space), 6 (space). So row 4, column 4 is H.\nRow 5: #  A  A# (apples here. Let's see positions: \"  A  A\" so columns 2 and 5 have A)\nRow 6: #A     # (apple in column 1)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake can't reverse direction, so if moving DOWN, the next direction can't be UP. Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (but since the direction is already DOWN, maybe the player can choose to keep moving DOWN or turn LEFT\/RIGHT, as long as not reversing).\n\nThe snake's body is made of 'S's. Let's map the snake's body. The head is at (4,4) (row 4, column 4, assuming rows are 0-7 and columns 0-7). Now, the body parts are in rows 1-3. Let's list the positions of 'S's:\n\nRow 1: columns 1-5 (since \"# SSSSS#\" → columns 1 is S, 2 S, 3 S, 4 S, 5 S)\nRow 2: \"# SSS S#\" → columns 1,2,3 (SSS), then column 5 (S)\nRow 3: \"# SSSSS#\" → columns 1-5 (SSSSS)\n\nSo the body is in those positions. Now, the snake's movement: when moving, the head moves to the next square in the direction, and the body follows. If the head moves into an apple, the snake grows (so the tail doesn't move, adding a new segment). Otherwise, the tail moves forward (so the body shifts).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So the next head position would be row 5, column 4 (since moving down from row 4, column 4). Let's check row 5: \"#  A  A#\" → row 5, column 4 is a space (since \"  A  A\" is columns 2 (A), 5 (A), so columns 1 is space, 2 A, 3 space, 4 space, 5 A, 6 space). So row 5, column 4 is a space. So if the snake continues moving DOWN, the head would go to (5,4). Is that safe? Let's check if that square is a wall or body. The walls are only on the edges (rows 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7). (5,4) is within the board (rows 1-6, columns 1-6). Now, is (5,4) part of the snake's body? The body is in rows 1-3. So (5,4) is empty. So moving DOWN here would be safe. But is there an apple there? No, because row 5 has apples at columns 2 and 5. So (5,4) is empty. So moving DOWN would not eat an apple.\n\nAlternatively, the snake could turn LEFT or RIGHT. Let's check possible directions. Since current direction is DOWN, the snake can't reverse to UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\nLet's check LEFT: moving LEFT from (4,4) would take the head to (4,3). What's in (4,3)? The current row 4 is \"#   H  #\", which is \"  H  \" → positions 2 (space), 3 (space), 4 (H), 5 (space), 6 (space). So (4,3) is a space. Is that part of the body? Let's check. The body is in rows 1-3. (4,3) is row 4, column 3, which is not part of the S's in rows 1-3. So (4,3) is safe. But moving LEFT would change direction from DOWN to LEFT. Then, the next move direction would be LEFT. But need to check if (4,3) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT: from (4,4) to (4,5). (4,5) is a space (row 4 is \"  H  \", so column 5 is space). Safe? Yes.\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's look for apples. Apples are at row 5, columns 2 and 5; row 6, column 1.\n\nThe head is at (4,4). Let's see the positions of apples:\n\n- (5,2): row 5, column 2 (A)\n- (5,5): row 5, column 5 (A)\n- (6,1): row 6, column 1 (A)\n\nSo, possible paths to reach these apples. Let's think about the current direction (DOWN). If we move DOWN to (5,4), then next possible moves. From (5,4), possible directions (since current direction would be DOWN, unless we turn). From (5,4), moving DOWN again would take us to (6,4). What's in row 6? \"#A     #\" → row 6, column 1 is A, columns 2-6 are spaces. So (6,4) is a space. Then, from (6,4), moving DOWN would hit row 7 (wall), which is bad. So that's not good.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,4), turning LEFT would go to (5,3), then (5,2) which is an apple. That's a possible path. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head (4,4) → move DOWN to (5,4). Then next move LEFT to (5,3). Then LEFT to (5,2) (apple). That would be two moves to reach the apple at (5,2).\n\nAlternatively, if the snake turns LEFT now (from current position (4,4)), moving LEFT to (4,3). Then, direction is LEFT. Next move could be LEFT again (to (4,2)), then DOWN (since can't reverse LEFT to RIGHT). Let's see (4,2) is a space. Then, moving DOWN from (4,2) would go to (5,2), which is an apple. That's two moves as well: LEFT (4,3), then DOWN (5,2). That's possible. But wait, can the snake turn direction? Let's clarify the movement rules: the player provides direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse direction. So, if current direction is DOWN, the next direction can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. So, if we choose LEFT now, the snake will move LEFT (from (4,4) to (4,3)), then the next direction can be LEFT, UP, or DOWN (since current direction is now LEFT; can't reverse to RIGHT). But the goal is to reach apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (4,4) to (4,5). Then, direction is RIGHT. Then, moving DOWN from (4,5) would go to (5,5), which is an apple. That's two moves: RIGHT (4,5), then DOWN (5,5). That's a good path. Let's check that:\n\nCurrent head (4,4). If direction is RIGHT, move to (4,5). That's safe (no collision). Then, next direction can be RIGHT, UP, or DOWN (since current direction is RIGHT, can't reverse to LEFT). If we then choose DOWN, the head moves from (4,5) to (5,5), which is an apple. Eating that apple would increase the score and grow the snake.\n\nSo moving RIGHT now would lead to the apple at (5,5) in the next move. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent position (4,4), direction is DOWN. If we choose RIGHT as the next direction, the snake moves RIGHT to (4,5). Check (4,5): is it a body part? The body is in rows 1-3, so (4,5) is a space. Safe. Then, next epoch, the direction could be DOWN again (since the current direction would be RIGHT, but the player can choose to move DOWN (since RIGHT can turn to DOWN, as they are not reverse). Wait, the movement direction is controlled by the player's input each time. The snake's movement direction is the direction input given. So each step, the player chooses a direction (as long as it's not reversing the previous direction). So the current direction is DOWN. The next direction can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since UP is reverse). So if the player chooses RIGHT now, the snake moves RIGHT. Then, the next direction (epoch 37's direction) would be whatever the player chooses next, but that's beyond the current decision. The current decision is to pick the direction for the next move (epoch 36's move, leading to epoch 37's state).\n\nSo, in the current step, the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. Let's check each:\n\n1. DOWN: head moves to (5,4). That's a space, no apple. Safe. But no score increase.\n\n2. LEFT: head moves to (4,3). Space, safe. No apple.\n\n3. RIGHT: head moves to (4,5). Space, safe. No apple.\n\nBut wait, in row 5, column 5 is an apple. So (5,5) is A. If the snake is at (4,5) (after moving RIGHT), then moving DOWN (next direction) would take it to (5,5), which is the apple. So if the player chooses RIGHT now, the next move (epoch 37) could be DOWN to get the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if the player chooses DOWN now, moving to (5,4), then next direction could be RIGHT to (5,5), which is the apple. Let's check:\n\nIf current direction is DOWN, move to (5,4). Then, next direction could be RIGHT (since current direction is DOWN, next direction can't be UP). So from (5,4), moving RIGHT to (5,5), which is the apple. That's also possible.\n\nSo which is better? Both paths can reach the apple in two steps. But we need to make sure that the path is safe (no collision with body or walls).\n\nLet's check the body positions again. The snake's body is in rows 1-3. Let's list all the S positions:\n\nRow 1 (index 1): columns 1,2,3,4,5 (since \"# SSSSS#\" → columns 1-5 are S)\nRow 2 (index 2): columns 1,2,3 (SSS) and column 5 (S) → so (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5)\nRow 3 (index 3): columns 1-5 (SSSSS) → (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nSo the body is in those positions. The head is at (4,4). So the snake's body is below the head (rows 1-3 are above row 4). So the snake is arranged such that the head is in row 4, and the body is in rows 1-3. So the snake is probably moving downward, with the body trailing above.\n\nNow, when the snake moves, the body segments follow. So the current snake's length is the number of S's plus the H. Let's count the S's:\n\nRow 1: 5 S's\nRow 2: 4 S's (columns 1,2,3,5)\nRow 3: 5 S's\nTotal S's: 5+4+5=14. So the snake's length is 14 (body) + 1 (head) = 15. So when the snake moves, each step (without eating) the tail (the last S) would be removed, and the head moves. But when it eats an apple, the tail stays, and the head moves, increasing length by 1.\n\nBut for collision detection, we need to check if the new head position is in the body (any S) or a wall.\n\nSo, for the current possible moves:\n\n- Moving DOWN: new head (5,4). Check if (5,4) is S or wall. (5,4) is row 5, column 4. The S's are in rows 1-3, so (5,4) is safe. No collision.\n\n- Moving LEFT: new head (4,3). (4,3) is row 4, column 3. The S's are in rows 1-3, so (4,3) is safe. No collision.\n\n- Moving RIGHT: new head (4,5). (4,5) is row 4, column 5. The S's are in rows 1-3. (4,5) is safe. No collision.\n\nSo all three directions are safe. Now, the next step is to choose the direction that leads towards an apple.\n\nThe apples are at (5,2), (5,5), (6,1).\n\nThe head is at (4,4). Let's calculate the distance to each apple.\n\nApple at (5,2): row 5, column 2. Distance from (4,4): down 1, left 2. So two moves (down then left, or left then down).\n\nApple at (5,5): row5, column5. Distance from (4,4): down 1, right 1. So two moves (down then right, or right then down).\n\nApple at (6,1): row6, column1. Distance from (4,4): down 2, left 3. That's further.\n\nThe closest apples are (5,5) and (5,2). Between these, (5,5) is closer in terms of steps. Let's see:\n\nIf we move RIGHT now (to (4,5)), then next move DOWN (to (5,5)) would reach the apple. That's two steps.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN (to (5,4)), then RIGHT (to (5,5)) is also two steps.\n\nWhich path is better? Let's check if there are any obstacles. The body is in rows 1-3, so the area below row 4 (rows 5,6) is mostly empty except for the apples. So both paths are clear.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT now would be better. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head (4,4). Move RIGHT → (4,5). Then, next move DOWN → (5,5) (apple). That's safe. (5,5) is an apple, so eating it would grow the snake.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN → (5,4). Then, move RIGHT → (5,5). Also safe.\n\nBut which direction should we choose now? The question is to pick the direction for the current move (epoch 36). Since the current direction is DOWN, and the player can choose to go RIGHT (which is allowed, as it's not reversing).\n\nSo the best choice is to move RIGHT, to position (4,5), then next move DOWN to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN then RIGHT. But in the current step, which direction gets us closer?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT is better because (4,5) is adjacent to (5,5) (the apple). So moving RIGHT now allows the next move to be DOWN to reach the apple. So the answer would be RIGHT.\n\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSS S#\n# SSSSS#\n#   H  #\n#  A  A#\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game board, snake position, and apple locations. The snake's head ('H') is at row 4, column 4. The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse to UP. The goal is to move toward apples ('A') while avoiding self-collision or walls.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Snake Position**: The snake's body ('S') occupies rows 1-3 (columns 1-5, with some gaps in row 2). The head is in row 4, column 4, with no body segments in rows 4-6, so the area below the head is mostly clear.\n2. **Apple Locations**: Apples are at (5,2), (5,5), and (6,1) (row, column). The closest apples are (5,5) (row 5, column 5) and (5,2) (row 5, column 2).\n3. **Possible Moves**: From the head (4,4), valid directions (not reversing DOWN) are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (5,4). This is safe (no collision), but (5,4) is empty (no apple). From (5,4), the next move could be RIGHT to reach (5,5) (apple) in the following step.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (4,3). This is safe but (4,3) is empty. From (4,3), the next move could be DOWN to reach (5,3), then LEFT to (5,2) (apple), but this is a longer path.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,5). This is safe (no collision), and (4,5) is empty. From (4,5), the next move DOWN would directly reach (5,5) (apple), which is the closest apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (5,5) in the next step, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided. \n\nThe board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' as walls. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# → So positions (1,1) to (1,5) are S (since index starts at 0, columns 1-5 are S)\nRow 2: # SSS S# → Columns 1-3 are S, then column 5 is S (so (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5))\nRow 3: # SSS S# → Same as row 2? Columns 1-3 and 5: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,5)\nRow 4: #   SH # → Let's see. Columns 3 and 4: (4,3) is S, (4,4) is H (head). Because it's \"  SH \" → positions 2 is space, 3 is S, 4 is H, 5 is space. So (4,3) is S, (4,4) is H.\nRow 5: #  A  A# → Columns 2 and 5 are A. So (5,2) and (5,5)\nRow 6: #A     # → Column 1 is A. (6,1)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right. The head (H) is at (4,4). If the snake continues moving RIGHT, the next position would be (4,5). Let's check what's there. Looking at row 4: \"#   SH #\", which is columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: S, 4: H, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So (4,5) is a space. But wait, the snake's body: let's check if (4,5) is part of the snake's body. Let's list all the S positions.\n\nFrom row 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5)\nRow 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,5)\nRow 4: (4,3) → S\nSo (4,5) is a space, not part of the body. So moving RIGHT would take H to (4,5). Is that safe? Let's check walls. The walls are at column 0 and 7 (all rows), and rows 0 and 7. (4,5) is column 5, row 4. Column 5 is within 0-7 (since 7 is the wall). So not hitting a wall. So moving RIGHT is possible.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's an apple in that direction? Let's check where the apples are. Apples are in row 5, columns 2 and 5 (positions (5,2), (5,5)), and row 6, column 1 (6,1). So (4,5) is not an apple. So moving RIGHT would just move the head there, and the body would follow. The snake's length is the number of S and H. Let's count the S and H. \n\nRow 1: 5 S → 5\nRow 2: 4 S (columns 1-3 and 5) → 4\nRow 3: 4 S → 4\nRow 4: 1 S (column 3) and 1 H → 1 S. So total S: 5+4+4+1 = 14. H is 1, so total length 15. When moving, the head moves, and the tail (the last S) would be removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nBut the current direction is RIGHT, and the snake can't reverse direction. So possible directions the player can choose are LEFT, UP, DOWN, but not the opposite of current direction. The current direction is RIGHT; the opposite is LEFT. Wait, no. Wait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, example: if current direction is UP, can't turn to DOWN. If current is LEFT, can't turn to RIGHT. So current direction is RIGHT, so the opposite direction is LEFT. So the snake cannot turn to LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n\nSo possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse of RIGHT, which is not allowed).\n\nNow, the head is at (4,4). Let's check the possible next positions for each direction:\n\n- RIGHT: (4,5). As before, which is a space (no collision, no apple). Safe.\n\n- UP: direction is UP. So moving from (4,4) up to (3,4). Let's check what's at (3,4). Row 3 is \"# SSS S#\", so columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4: space, 5:S, 6: space, 7: #. So (3,4) is space. So moving UP to (3,4). Is that part of the snake's body? Let's check the S positions. From row 3, S are at (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,5). (3,4) is space, so safe.\n\n- DOWN: direction is DOWN. So moving from (4,4) down to (5,4). Row 5 is \"#  A  A#\", columns 0: #, 1: space, 2:A, 3: space, 4: space, 5:A, 6: space, 7: #. So (5,4) is space. Safe.\n\nBut wait, the snake's body is all the S's. Let's confirm all positions:\n\nRow 1 (y=1): x=1,2,3,4,5 → (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nRow 2 (y=2): x=1,2,3,5 → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5)\n\nRow 3 (y=3): x=1,2,3,5 → (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,5)\n\nRow 4 (y=4): x=3 → (4,3)\n\nSo all S positions are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3). The H is at (4,4).\n\nSo (3,4) (UP) is (y=3, x=4) → not in S positions. Safe.\n\n(5,4) (DOWN) is (y=5, x=4) → not in S positions. Safe.\n\n(4,5) (RIGHT) → (y=4, x=5) → not in S positions. Safe.\n\nSo all three directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are possible. Now, the goal is to eat apples. Let's check where the apples are. Apples are at (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). Let's see which direction can reach an apple next.\n\nCurrent head is (4,4). Let's see:\n\nIf moving RIGHT to (4,5). Then, next move (epoch 38) the direction could be... but perhaps we need to think about the immediate next step. Let's check if (4,5) is an apple. No, (4,5) is space. So moving RIGHT now doesn't eat an apple.\n\nIf moving UP to (3,4). (3,4) is space. Not an apple.\n\nIf moving DOWN to (5,4). (5,4) is space. Not an apple. So none of these immediate moves eat an apple.\n\nBut maybe after that, the next moves. Let's think about the path to the apples.\n\nThe apples are at (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). Let's see the positions:\n\nApple 1: (5,2) → row 5, column 2.\n\nApple 2: (5,5) → row 5, column 5.\n\nApple 3: (6,1) → row 6, column 1.\n\nCurrent head is (4,4). Let's see distances.\n\nTo (5,2): from (4,4) → need to move down once (to 5,4), then left twice (5,3, 5,2). So if direction is DOWN now, then next possible directions (since current direction would be DOWN, next can't be UP). So after moving DOWN to (5,4), next direction could be LEFT (since current direction is DOWN, opposite is UP, so allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN). Moving LEFT from (5,4) to (5,3), then LEFT again to (5,2) which is the apple. So that's a path.\n\nTo (5,5): (4,4) → move RIGHT to (4,5), then DOWN to (5,5). (5,5) is an apple. Let's check: (4,4) → RIGHT to (4,5). Then next direction would be DOWN (since current direction is RIGHT, can't go LEFT). So from (4,5), moving DOWN to (5,5) which is an apple. That's two steps. So if we go RIGHT now, then next direction DOWN, then we can eat that apple.\n\nApple (6,1): (4,4) → need to move down two rows (to 6,4), then left three columns (6,3, 6,2, 6,1). That's longer. Probably not the best path.\n\nSo (5,5) is an apple. Let's check if moving RIGHT now allows us to reach (5,5) next step. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head (4,4). Direction RIGHT → next head (4,5). Then, if we choose direction DOWN (since current direction is RIGHT, next direction can be DOWN, which is allowed). Then from (4,5) moving DOWN to (5,5), which is an apple. That would be epoch 38 (current epoch 37) → moving RIGHT (epoch 37's move) → head at (4,5) (epoch 38). Then, epoch 38's move direction is DOWN, leading to (5,5) (epoch 39), which is an apple. So that's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now (epoch 37's direction) would take head to (5,4). Then, next direction could be RIGHT to (5,5) (apple). Let's see:\n\nEpoch 37: direction DOWN → head (5,4). Then, epoch 38's direction could be RIGHT (since current direction is DOWN, can't go UP; allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN). So moving RIGHT from (5,4) to (5,5), which is the apple. That's also a path. So both directions (RIGHT and DOWN) can lead to eating the apple at (5,5) in two steps.\n\nWhat about moving UP? Let's see. Moving UP to (3,4). Then, next direction could be... let's say RIGHT to (3,5). (3,5) is S (from row 3: \"# SSS S#\" → column 5 is S). Oh! (3,5) is part of the snake's body. So if we move UP to (3,4), then next direction RIGHT would take us to (3,5), which is S. That's a collision. So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,4), then direction DOWN. Then from (3,4) moving DOWN to (4,4), which was the previous head position (now S, since the snake moves and the body follows). Because when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and the tail (the last S) is removed. So after moving UP to (3,4), the body would shift. Let's think about how the snake's body updates. \n\nThe snake's body is a sequence. The head is H, followed by S's. Each move, the head moves in the direction, and each S follows the previous part. So the body segments move into the position of the segment in front of them. So, for example, if the snake is H -> S1 -> S2 -> S3, moving right would make H go to new position, S1 to H's old position, S2 to S1's old, etc., and the tail (S3) is removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nIn the current setup, the snake's body is a chain. Let's try to model the snake's body as a list of coordinates, with the head first.\n\nCurrent head is at (4,4). Let's figure out the body segments. The body (S's) are connected. Let's see:\n\nLooking at row 4: (4,3) is S. So that's the first body segment after the head. Then, where is the next S? Let's look for adjacent S's.\n\n(4,3) is S. Let's check adjacent positions (up, down, left, right) for S.\n\n(4,3) → up is (3,3) (row 3, column 3) → which is S (row 3: \"# SSS S#\" → column 3 is S). So (3,3) is S. Then, (3,3) up is (2,3) (row 2, column 3) → S (row 2: \"# SSS S#\" → column 3 is S). Then (2,3) up is (1,3) (row 1, column 3) → S (row 1: \"# SSSSS#\" → column 3 is S). Then (1,3) left is (1,2) (row 1, column 2) → S. Then (1,2) left is (1,1) (row 1, column 1) → S. Then (1,1) right is (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) → row 1 has S from 1-5. So (1,4) and (1,5) are S. (1,5) → down to (2,5) (row 2, column 5) → S (row 2: \"# SSS S#\" → column 5 is S). (2,5) down to (3,5) (row 3, column 5) → S (row 3: \"# SSS S#\" → column 5 is S).\n\nSo the snake's body is a chain. Let's list the segments in order (head first, then body):\n\nHead: (4,4)\nBody 1: (4,3)\nBody 2: (3,3)\nBody 3: (2,3)\nBody 4: (1,3)\nBody 5: (1,4)\nBody 6: (1,5)\nBody 7: (2,5)\nBody 8: (3,5)\nBody 9: (1,2)\nBody 10: (1,1)\nBody 11: (2,1)\nBody 12: (3,1)\nBody 13: (2,2)\nBody 14: (3,2)\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model the snake's body as a linked list. Alternatively, since the snake is moving right, the direction is right, so the body should be trailing behind. Let's think: when the snake moves right, the head is moving right, so the previous positions would be to the left of the head. So the body segments are to the left of the head, then possibly other parts.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check for possible collisions. For example, if the snake turns UP, what's the next position. (4,4) moving UP to (3,4). Let's check (3,4) for S: no, (3,4) is space. So that's safe. Then, after moving UP, the new head is (3,4), and the body segments shift. The previous head (4,4) becomes S, and the tail (the last S) is removed (unless an apple is eaten).\n\nBut perhaps the key is to avoid collisions. Let's check all possible directions:\n\n1. RIGHT: (4,5). Safe (no S, no wall). Next possible moves could lead to apple (5,5) in next step.\n\n2. UP: (3,4). Safe. But next move, if direction is RIGHT, (3,5) is S (row 3, column 5 is S). So that would collide. So UP might lead to a collision if we turn right.\n\n3. DOWN: (5,4). Safe. Then, moving RIGHT to (5,5) (apple) is possible.\n\nSo which direction is better? Let's see. The apple at (5,5) is in row 5, column 5. Current head is (4,4). If we move RIGHT to (4,5), then moving DOWN to (5,5) (apple) in the next step. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4), then RIGHT to (5,5) (apple) in the next step. Both paths are possible.\n\nBut need to check if the path is clear. Let's check (4,5) → moving RIGHT. (4,5) is space. Then, moving DOWN from (4,5) to (5,5) (apple). (5,5) is an apple, so that's good. That would be a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4). (5,4) is space, then moving RIGHT to (5,5) (apple). Also valid.\n\nWhich direction is better? Let's see. Are there any obstacles in the way?\n\nFor RIGHT then DOWN:\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. After moving RIGHT (epoch 37), the new direction can be DOWN (since current direction is RIGHT, can't go LEFT, but UP, DOWN, RIGHT are allowed). So direction DOWN in epoch 38, moving from (4,5) to (5,5) (apple). That's safe. (5,5) is not part of the body. Because the body segments are:\n\nAfter moving RIGHT, the head is (4,5). The previous head (4,4) becomes S, and the tail (the last S) is removed. Let's say the tail was at (1,1) (assuming the snake's body is a chain). When the snake moves, the tail (last S) is removed. So the new body would include (4,4) as S, and the rest of the body shifts. So (5,5) is not part of the body. So that's safe.\n\nFor DOWN then RIGHT:\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. If we choose DOWN, the new direction is DOWN (epoch 37). The head moves to (5,4). Then, in epoch 38, direction can be RIGHT (since current direction is DOWN, can't go UP, but LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN are allowed). So moving RIGHT from (5,4) to (5,5) (apple). That's also safe. (5,5) is not part of the body.\n\nSo both directions (RIGHT and DOWN) can lead to eating an apple. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, check if there's any immediate danger. For example, if the snake continues moving RIGHT, are there any walls or body parts ahead? (4,5) is safe, (4,6) would be next, but that's row 4, column 6. Row 4 is \"#   SH #\", column 6 is space, so (4,6) is space. But maybe not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if any direction leads to a dead end. For example, moving UP could lead into the body. Let's say after moving UP to (3,4), the next direction could be LEFT. (3,4) moving LEFT to (3,3), which is S (body). That's a collision. So UP might not be the best choice.\n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. Which is better? Let's see the apple positions again. (5,5) is in row 5, column 5. If we go RIGHT then DOWN, that's two steps. If we go DOWN then RIGHT, also two steps. Both are possible. But perhaps the direction that allows the snake to have more space. Let's check the area around.\n\nThe snake's body is mostly on the left and upper part of the board. The lower part (rows 5 and 6) have apples and more space. So moving DOWN might lead the snake into more open area, which is better for avoiding collisions in the future. Alternatively, moving RIGHT might also be okay.\n\nBut the question is, which direction should be chosen now. Since the current direction is RIGHT, and the snake can continue moving RIGHT, which is allowed. Let's think about the example given. In the example, when moving in a direction that leads to an apple, the snake grows. So the best choice is to move towards the nearest apple. The apple at (5,5) is the closest. So either direction that leads towards it is good.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the positions again. If we move RIGHT now (epoch 37), the head is at (4,5). Then, in epoch 38, moving DOWN to (5,5) (apple). That's correct. So that's a valid path. So choosing RIGHT now.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSS S#\n# SSS S#\n#   SH #\n#  A  A#\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4), and it is currently moving RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the allowed directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (LEFT is the reverse of RIGHT and is invalid). \n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,5). This position is empty (no wall or snake body collision). From (4,5), the snake can then move DOWN to (5,5) in the next step, which is an apple ('A'). This path leads to eating an apple.\n   \n2. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,4). This position is empty, but (3,5) (a potential next move to the RIGHT) is part of the snake's body (S), risking a collision. This direction is less favorable.\n   \n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (5,4). This position is empty, and from (5,4), the snake can move RIGHT to (5,5) (an apple) in the next step. However, this path is slightly longer than moving RIGHT first.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to reach the apple at (5,5) in the fewest steps (two moves: RIGHT then DOWN). This direction avoids immediate collisions and directly targets an apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls as '#'. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # SSSSS#\nRow 2: # SSS S#\nRow 3: # SSS  #\nRow 4: #   SSH#\nRow 5: #  A  A#\nRow 6: #A     #\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the epoch is 38, which is well before 100, so the game isn't ending yet.\n\nFirst, let's locate the snake's head. The head is 'H'. Looking at row 4: \"#   SSH#\", so positions are 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: S, 5: S, 6: H, 7: #. So the head (H) is at (4,6) (row 4, column 6). \n\nThe snake's body is 'S' in the board. Let's track the snake's body to understand its current path. The snake is moving RIGHT, so the next move direction can't be LEFT (since reversing is not allowed). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n\nNow, check where the head would move next in each possible direction:\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The next position if moving RIGHT would be (4,7), but row 4, column 7 is a wall ('#'). So moving RIGHT would cause a wall collision. That's bad. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nSo the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (but wait, can we go LEFT? Because current direction is RIGHT, reversing direction (LEFT) is not allowed. Oh right! The rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. So from RIGHT, the snake can't go LEFT. So possible directions are UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\nOption 1: UP. The head is at (4,6). Moving UP would take it to (3,6). Let's check what's at (3,6). Row 3 is \"# SSS  #\". So columns 0-7: 0 is #, 1 is S, 2 is S, 3 is S, 4 is space, 5 is space, 6 is space, 7 is #. So (3,6) is a space. That's safe. Now, is there an apple there? No, apples are in row 5 and 6. So moving UP would take the head to (3,6), which is empty. The snake would move, and since there's no apple, the tail (the end of the snake) would move forward, so the body would shift.\n\nOption 2: DOWN. The head is at (4,6). Moving DOWN would take it to (5,6). Let's check row 5: \"#  A  A#\". Columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: A, 4: space, 5: space, 6: A, 7: #. So (5,6) is an apple ('A'). Oh, that's good! If the snake moves DOWN, it will eat the apple. Then the snake grows by one, so the tail doesn't shrink. Let's confirm: moving DOWN to (5,6) which is an apple. That's a valid move.\n\nNow, check if moving DOWN would cause a collision. The new head position (5,6) is an apple, not a body part. So no collision. The body is 'S's, and (5,6) is A, so safe.\n\nSo moving DOWN would allow the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score. That's better than moving UP which doesn't get an apple.\n\nWhat about possible collisions after moving? Let's see. After moving DOWN, the head is at (5,6). The next step, the direction could be adjusted, but for this move, we just need to ensure this move is safe.\n\nIs there any other reason not to move DOWN? Let's check if (5,6) is part of the snake's body. The current snake's body is in rows 1-4. Row 5 has apples, so (5,6) is A, not S. So safe.\n\nSo the best direction here is DOWN, as it allows the snake to eat an apple, which is beneficial.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSS S#\n# SSS  #\n#   SSH#\n#  A  A#\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is located at row 4, column 6. The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The next possible directions are UP or DOWN. \n\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,7), which is a wall, causing a collision (invalid).  \n- Moving UP would take the head to (3,6), which is empty (no apple, safe but no score gain).  \n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (5,6), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or body) and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# → So positions (1,1) to (1,5) are S (body segments)\nRow 2: # SSS S# → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) are S; (2,5) is S\nRow 3: # SSS  # → (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are S\nRow 4: #  ASSS# → (4,2) and (4,3) are A (apple), (4,4), (4,5) are S\nRow 5: #  A  H# → (5,2) is A, (5,5) is H (head)\nRow 6: #A     # → (6,1) is A\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. Let's confirm the head's position. The head (H) is at (5,5). Since the current direction is DOWN, the next position the head would move to is (6,5) (since moving down from row 5 to row 6, same column 5). Let's check what's at (6,5). Looking at row 6: #A     #. The columns are 0 to 7 (since it's 8 characters). So row 6, column 0 is #, column 1 is A, columns 2-6 are spaces, column 7 is #. So (6,5) is a space (empty). \n\nBut wait, the snake's body is made of S. We need to check if moving to (6,5) would hit the body. Let's list all the S positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5)\nRow 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\nRow 4: (4,4), (4,5)\nRow 5: The head is at (5,5), so the body here would be previous positions. Wait, the snake's body is S, so H is the head, and S are the body segments. So H is (5,5). Let's list all S positions:\n\nFrom row 1: columns 1-5 (so (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5))\nRow 2: columns 1-3 and 5 → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5)\nRow 3: columns 1-3 → (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\nRow 4: columns 4-5 → (4,4), (4,5)\nRow 5: No S except H. So H is (5,5).\n\nSo the next position if moving DOWN is (6,5). Let's check (6,5): row 6, column 5. The row 6 is \"#A     #\", so columns are 0: #, 1: A, 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (6,5) is a space. So that's safe. But are there any apples there? No. So moving down would not eat an apple, but just move the head to (6,5). The body would follow, but since the snake's length depends on how many apples eaten. The initial length is 1, and each apple increases it by 1. Let's see the current number of apples. The board has A's at (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). So 4 apples. So the snake's length is 1 (initial) + 4 (apples eaten) = 5? Or wait, the initial snake starts with length 1. Each apple eaten increases length by 1. So if there are 3 apples at the start, and the snake has eaten some, the current length would be 1 + number of apples eaten. Let's count the current A's on the board. Let's check each row:\n\nRow 1: # SSSSS# → no A.\nRow 2: # SSS S# → no A.\nRow 3: # SSS  # → no A.\nRow 4: #  ASSS# → A at (4,2) and (4,3)\nRow 5: #  A  H# → A at (5,2)\nRow 6: #A     # → A at (6,1)\nSo there are 4 apples on the board. Since the game starts with 3 apples, the snake must have eaten (initial 3 + new apples generated? Or maybe apples are not regenerated unless eaten. The problem statement says: \"the game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board.\" So perhaps when an apple is eaten, a new one is generated? The example given shows that after eating an apple, the next state has two A's. The initial example had three A's (the example's board has A's in row 1 (column 5), row 4 (columns 4 and 5?), and row 4 (A in row 4 column 0? Let me check the example again. The example's board was:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSo row 1 (second row) has A at (1,5), row 4 has AA (columns 1 and 2), so 3 A's. After moving down, the next state is:\n\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSo row 1 has A's at (1,3) and (1,5), row 4 has H and A. So 3 A's again. So perhaps when an apple is eaten, a new one is placed. So the number of apples remains 3? But the problem statement says: \"the game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.\" So perhaps apples are not replenished, so the total apples available are 3. But in the example, the initial board has 3 A's (row 1: A, row 4: AA → 1+2=3), and after eating one (H moves to A), the next state has 2 A's (row 1: 2 A's, row 4: 1 A → 2+1=3? The example next state's row 1 is #  A  A# → that's two A's (columns 3 and 5), row 4 is #HA    # → H at (4,1), A at (4,2). So 2 (row1) +1 (row4) = 3. Oh, right. So after eating one, a new one is generated. So the number of apples remains 3. So in the current problem, how many apples are on the board? Let's recount:\n\nCurrent board:\n\nRow 4: #  ASSS# → columns 2 and 3 → A's. So (4,2), (4,3) → 2 A's.\nRow 5: #  A  H# → column 2 → (5,2) → 1 A.\nRow 6: #A     # → column 1 → (6,1) → 1 A.\nTotal of 4 A's. Hmm, maybe the example's initial count was 3, and after eating, 3 again, but perhaps in the current problem, the count is 4. Maybe apples can be more than 3 if not all have been eaten. The problem statement says \"the game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board.\" So maybe new apples are not generated. So the current apples are 3. Let's not get stuck on that. Let's focus on the movement.\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN. The snake can't reverse direction, so if current direction is DOWN, the next direction can't be UP. Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nThe head is at (5,5). Let's note the coordinates: rows are 0 (top) to 7 (bottom). Columns 0 (left) to 7 (right). So (row, column).\n\nCurrent head position: (5,5). Moving DOWN would take it to (6,5). Let's check (6,5): as per row 6: \"#A     #\", so (6,5) is a space (no wall, no body). So moving down is possible.\n\nIf we choose to turn LEFT, the direction would be LEFT. The snake can't reverse, so current direction is DOWN, so possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. Turning LEFT is allowed. So the new direction would be LEFT. The head would move to (5,4). Let's check (5,4): row 5 is \"#  A  H#\", which is columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: A, 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: H, 6: ' ', 7: #. So (5,4) is a space. Is that position part of the body? Let's check S positions. The S's are in rows 1,2,3,4. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1 (row=1): columns 1-5 → (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\nRow 2 (row=2): columns 1-3, 5 → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5)\nRow 3 (row=3): columns 1-3 → (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\nRow 4 (row=4): columns 4-5 → (4,4), (4,5)\nSo (5,4) is not an S. So moving LEFT to (5,4) is safe.\n\nIf we turn RIGHT, direction becomes RIGHT. The head would move to (5,6). Check (5,6): row 5, column 6 is ' ' (since row 5 is \"#  A  H#\", column 6 is ' ' (since H is at column 5, column 6 is next). So (5,6) is a space. Check if it's a body part. No S there, so safe.\n\nIf we continue moving DOWN, head goes to (6,5). Let's check if that's a body part. The S positions are up to row 4. Row 6's S positions? No. So (6,5) is safe.\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's check where the apples are. The A's are at:\n\n(4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). Let's see the head's current position (5,5). What directions would lead to an apple in the next move?\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT (direction LEFT), head moves to (5,4). No apple there.\n\nIf moves RIGHT (direction RIGHT), head moves to (5,6). No apple.\n\nIf moves DOWN (direction DOWN), head moves to (6,5). No apple.\n\nWhat about possible next moves beyond the immediate step? Maybe plan a path towards the apples.\n\nThe closest apples are at (5,2) (same row as head, two columns to the left). The head is at (5,5). To reach (5,2), the snake would need to move left multiple times. Let's see if the path is clear.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, so the snake is moving down. If we turn left, direction becomes LEFT. Then next move is (5,4). Then, if we keep moving left, next (5,3), then (5,2) which is an apple. That's a good target. Let's check if the path from (5,5) to (5,2) is clear.\n\nCurrent head at (5,5). Let's check (5,4): empty. (5,3): row 5, column 3 is ' ' (row 5: \"#  A  H#\" → columns 0-7: 0=#,1= ,2=A,3= ,4= ,5=H,6= ,7=#). So (5,3) is empty. (5,2) is A. So if the snake can move left three times, it can reach that apple. But need to check for body collisions.\n\nBut what's the snake's body structure? Let's think about the snake's body. Since the snake is moving down, the body segments are trailing behind. The head is at (5,5). The previous position (before moving down) would have been (4,5) (since direction was down). Because when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and the body follows. So the body segments are the previous positions of the head. Let's reconstruct the snake's body.\n\nThe snake's length is 1 (initial) plus the number of apples eaten. Let's see how many apples are on the board. The problem says the game starts with 3 apples. The current board has 4 A's (row4: 2, row5:1, row6:1). If the snake has eaten some apples, then the initial 3 apples minus eaten apples plus new apples (if any) would be current count. But perhaps the snake's length is determined by the number of apples eaten. Let's assume the snake has eaten, say, 5 apples (so length 6), but perhaps that's not necessary. Let's instead look at the S positions. The S's are the body. Let's count the number of S's on the board. Let's go row by row:\n\nRow 1: # SSSSS# → 5 S's (columns 1-5)\nRow 2: # SSS S# → 4 S's (columns 1-3, 5)\nRow 3: # SSS  # → 3 S's (columns 1-3)\nRow4: #  ASSS# → 2 S's (columns 4-5)\nTotal S's: 5+4+3+2=14. So the snake's length is 14 (body) + 1 (head) = 15? That can't be right. Because initial length is 1, each apple adds 1. So 15 would mean 14 apples eaten. But the example shows that when the snake eats an apple, the body grows. For example, in the example, the initial snake has H and S (so length 2), and after eating an apple, the body grows (so length 3). So perhaps S's are the body segments, and the head is H, so the total length is (number of S) + 1. So in the example's initial board:\n\nExample initial board:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe S is in row 2, column 1. So 1 S, H in row 3, column 1. So length 2. After moving down (H moves to row 4, column 1), the next board has S in row 3, column 1 and row 2, column 1. So 2 S's, H in row 4, column 1. So length 3. Which matches eating an apple (score increases by 1, length increases by 1). So yes, the length is (number of S) + 1, and each apple eaten adds 1 to length (so adds one S to the body). So in the current problem, the number of S's is 5 (row1) +4 (row2) +3 (row3) +2 (row4) =14. So length is 15, which implies 14 apples eaten (since initial length 1, 1+14=15). That's a lot, but possible if the game is at epoch 39.\n\nNow, the snake's body is in a certain arrangement. Let's try to find the path of the body. The head is at (5,5). The previous position (since direction is DOWN) would be (4,5), which is S (row4, column5 is S). Then the position before that would be (3,5), but row3 has no S in column5. Row3 is # SSS  # → columns 1-3 are S. So (3,5) is empty. Hmm. Maybe the body is arranged in a way that the segments are not all in a straight line. Let's try to trace the body. Let's list all S positions and see if they form a continuous path.\n\nRow 4 has S at (4,4), (4,5). So (4,5) is adjacent to (5,5) (head), which is down. So (4,5) is the first body segment (just behind the head). Then (4,4) is next. So (4,4) is to the left of (4,5). Then, where is the next segment? Let's check row 3. Row 3 has S at (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (4,4) is (row4, column4). What's adjacent to (4,4)? Up would be (3,4) (row3, column4), which is empty. Left is (4,3) (row4, column3) which is A. Right is (4,5) (already part of the body). Down is (5,4) (row5, column4), which is empty. So (4,4) is connected to (4,5), which is connected to (5,5) (head). Then, where else are the S's?\n\nRow 2 has S at (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5). (2,5) is S. What's adjacent to (2,5)? Up is (1,5) (row1, column5) which is S. Down is (3,5) (row3, column5) which is empty. Left is (2,4) (row2, column4) which is empty. Right is (2,6) (row2, column6) which is empty. So (2,5) is connected to (1,5). (1,5) is S, row1, column5. (1,5) is adjacent to (1,4), which is S. (1,4) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) (all S in row1). (1,1) is adjacent to (2,1) (row2, column1) which is S. (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) (row2, columns 1-3 S). (2,3) is adjacent to (3,3) (row3, column3) which is S. (3,3) → (3,2) → (3,1) (row3, columns 1-3 S). So that's a separate part of the body. So the body has two parts: one is the head's trail (head at (5,5) → (4,5) → (4,4)), and another part that's a loop or a separate chain. But perhaps the snake has looped around, which is dangerous because if the head moves into any S, it's a collision.\n\nThe key is to avoid moving into any S or walls. Let's get back to possible directions. The current direction is DOWN, so possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (can't go UP). Let's evaluate each option:\n\nOption 1: Continue DOWN. Next head position is (6,5). Check if (6,5) is safe. (6,5) is in row6, column5. Row6 is \"#A     #\", so column5 is ' ', no wall. Are there any S's in (6,5)? The S's are in rows 1-4, so (6,5) is safe. Moving here would not eat an apple. Then, the next move (epoch 40) would depend on direction again.\n\nOption 2: Turn LEFT. New direction is LEFT. Next head position is (5,4). (5,4) is ' ', safe. Then, if we continue LEFT, next position (5,3), then (5,2) which is A. Eating that apple would be good. Let's check (5,2): that's an apple. So moving LEFT now, then LEFT again, then LEFT again would reach the apple. But need to check if (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) are safe. (5,4) is safe, (5,3) is safe (no S), (5,2) is A (so eating it would be good). Let's confirm (5,2) is A. Row5: \"#  A  H#\", so column2 is A. Correct. So (5,2) is an apple. So if the snake can move left three times, it can eat that apple. Let's check if the path from (5,5) to (5,2) is blocked by the body.\n\nThe head is at (5,5). (5,4) is empty. (5,3) is empty. (5,2) is A. So no S's in that path. So moving left is a good option.\n\nOption 3: Turn RIGHT. New direction is RIGHT. Next head position is (5,6). (5,6) is ' ', safe. Then, moving RIGHT again would take to (5,7), which is a wall (row5, column7 is #). So that's a collision. So moving RIGHT once is safe, but moving further right would hit a wall. So that's risky. Also, there's no apple in that direction.\n\nSo the best option is to turn LEFT. Because that direction leads towards an apple (the one at (5,2)), and the path is clear. Moving down doesn't lead to an apple, and moving right leads towards a wall. So the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSS S#\n# SSS  #\n#  ASSS#\n#  A  H#\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 5, column 5).\n- **Current Direction**: The snake is moving DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the next direction must be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (UP is invalid).\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (row 4, column 2), (row 4, column 3), (row 5, column 2), and (row 6, column 1).\n- **Body Segments ('S')**: The body occupies positions in rows 1-4 (detailed in the board parsing).\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 6, column 5). This position is empty (no wall or body), but there is no apple here. This avoids collision but does not contribute to scoring.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 5, column 6). This position is empty, but the next move RIGHT would reach (row 5, column 7), which is a wall (collision). No apples are in this direction.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 5, column 4). This position is empty (no wall or body). Continuing LEFT would lead to (row 5, column 3) (empty) and then (row 5, column 2) (an apple). This path is clear of obstacles and directly targets an apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to approach and eventually eat the apple at (row 5, column 2) in subsequent moves, maximizing score growth. Other directions either avoid apples or risk collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSS  #\n# SSS  #\n#  ASSS#\n#  A HS#\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 40 (so 60 more epochs left). The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. The apples are 'A'. The snake can't reverse direction, so since current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since LEFT is the current direction, but can it keep moving left? Let's check where the head is.\n\nLooking at the board, let's map the coordinates. Let's assume rows are numbered from top to bottom, 0 to 7, and columns 0 to 7 (since it's 8x8). The top row is row 0, bottom row 7. Each row's characters are columns 0 (left) to 7 (right).\n\nLet's find the head 'H'. Let's look at each row:\n\nRow 5 (since the rows are listed as 0 to 7, the 6th line is row 5): \"#  A HS#\". Let's parse that. The row is: #, space, space, A, space, H, S, #. So columns 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is space, 3 is A, 4 is space, 5 is H, 6 is S, 7 is #. So the head (H) is at (5,5) (row 5, column 5).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, so moving left would take the head to (5,4). Let's check what's at (5,4). Looking at row 5: \"#  A HS#\" → column 4 is a space. So moving left to (5,4) would be a space. That's safe. But wait, what's the snake's body? The body is 'S' cells. Let's check if (5,4) is part of the body. Let's check the board:\n\nRow 5: \"#  A HS#\" → columns 5 is H, 6 is S. So (5,6) is S.\n\nRow 4: \"#  ASSS#\" → columns 2 is space, 3 is A, 4 is S, 5 is S, 6 is S, 7 is #. So (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) are S.\n\nRow 3: \"# SSS  #\" → columns 1 is S, 2 is S, 3 is S, 4 is space, 5 is space, 6 is space, 7 is #. So (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are S.\n\nRow 2: \"# SSS  #\" → same as row 3, (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) are S.\n\nRow 1: \"# SSSSS#\" → columns 1 is S, 2 is S, 3 is S, 4 is S, 5 is S, 6 is space, 7 is #. So (1,1) to (1,5) are S.\n\nRow 6: \"#A     #\" → columns 1 is A, 2-6 are spaces, 7 is #. So (6,1) is A.\n\nSo, the head is at (5,5). Moving LEFT (current direction) would take it to (5,4). Let's check (5,4) in the current board. The row 5 is \"#  A HS#\", so column 4 is a space. So (5,4) is empty (not a wall, not body). So that's safe. Then, after moving, the head would be at (5,4), and the body would follow. Since the snake is moving, the tail (the last S) would move if no apple is eaten. But wait, are there any apples in (5,4)? Let's check (5,4) again. The current cell (5,4) is a space. So no apple there. So moving left would just move the head to (5,4), and the tail would remove the last S (since the snake's length remains the same unless it eats an apple).\n\nAlternatively, what if we change direction to UP or DOWN? The snake can't go RIGHT (reverse of LEFT). Let's check possible directions:\n\nPossible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT (since current is LEFT, can't go RIGHT).\n\nLet's check moving UP from (5,5). Moving UP would take the head to (4,5). Let's check (4,5) in the board. Row 4 is \"#  ASSS#\". Columns 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is space, 3 is A, 4 is S, 5 is S, 6 is S, 7 is #. So (4,5) is S (body). Oh, that's a collision with itself! So moving UP would cause the snake to hit its own body. So UP is invalid.\n\nMoving DOWN: from (5,5), moving DOWN would take the head to (6,5). Let's check row 6: \"#A     #\". Columns 0 is #, 1 is A, 2 is space, 3 is space, 4 is space, 5 is space, 6 is space, 7 is #. So (6,5) is a space. That's safe. So moving DOWN would take the head to (6,5), which is empty. Then, the tail would move (since no apple eaten here).\n\nBut what about apples? Let's check if there's an apple in the next positions. Let's list all apples. Current apples are:\n\nRow 5: (5,3) is A (row 5, column 3: \"#  A HS#\" → column 3 is A).\n\nRow 4: (4,3) is A (\"#  ASSS#\" → column 3 is A).\n\nRow 6: (6,1) is A (\"#A     #\" → column 1 is A).\n\nSo apples at (4,3), (5,3), (6,1).\n\nIf moving LEFT to (5,4): (5,4) is empty. So no apple eaten. The next position would be (5,4), which is safe.\n\nIf moving DOWN to (6,5): (6,5) is empty. No apple there. So safe.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT is the current direction, and the next cell (5,4) is safe. But let's check the snake's body structure. The snake's body is a chain. The head is at (5,5), then the next part is (5,6) (since row 5 has \"HS\", so H at 5, S at 6). Then, where's the rest of the body? Let's trace the S's:\n\nLooking at row 5: (5,6) is S.\n\nRow 4: (4,6) is S (from \"#  ASSS#\" → column 6 is S).\n\nRow 4, column 5 is S (row 4, column 5 is S).\n\nRow 4, column 4 is S (row 4, column 4 is S).\n\nRow 3: (3,3) is S (from \"# SSS  #\"), (3,2), (3,1).\n\nRow 2: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1).\n\nRow 1: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).\n\nSo the snake's body is a long chain. The head is at (5,5), then (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). That's a long snake.\n\nSo, when moving LEFT to (5,4), which is a space. So the head moves there, and the body follows. The tail (the last S) would be removed. The last S is probably at (1,1), because that's the end of the S's in row 1. So after moving, the new head is (5,4), and the body parts shift: (5,5) becomes S, (5,6) stays S, (4,6) stays S, etc., and (1,1) becomes a space.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,5) (row 6, column 5). That's a space, so head moves there. Then (5,5) becomes S, (5,6) stays S, etc. Tail (1,1) becomes space.\n\nBut what about other possible collisions. Let's check moving LEFT: (5,4) is safe, no body, no wall.\n\nMoving DOWN: (6,5) is safe. No body (since row 6, column 5 is space). So both LEFT and DOWN are possible. But what about the next steps? The snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's see where the apples are. The closest apples are at (5,3) (row 5, column 3) and (4,3) (row 4, column 3), and (6,1) (row 6, column 1).\n\nIf the snake is moving LEFT, next step (5,4). Then, if it continues LEFT, next would be (5,3), which is an apple! Oh, right. Because (5,3) is A. So moving LEFT now would take the head to (5,4) (safe), and then if the next direction is LEFT again, the head would move to (5,3), which is an apple. Eating that apple would make the snake grow. That's a good plan.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT now (current direction), then next epoch, it can move LEFT again (since direction can be same) to reach (5,3), which is an apple. So that's a path to eat an apple.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN now, then (6,5) is a space. Then, next possible directions could be DOWN (but row 7 is the bottom wall, so (7,5) is a wall. So moving DOWN again would hit the wall. So moving DOWN now would lead to possible wall collision next step. Because row 6 is row 6 (0-based), row 7 is the bottom wall. So (6,5) moving DOWN would go to (7,5), which is a wall. So that's a bad move. So direction DOWN now would be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now (to (6,5)), then next direction could be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. Let's see: (6,5) moving LEFT would go to (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) which is an apple. So (6,1) is an apple. So moving DOWN, then LEFT, then LEFT, then LEFT, then LEFT would reach (6,1). But that's 4 steps. But in the current step, moving LEFT is better because the apple at (5,3) is only two steps away (current head at (5,5), moving LEFT to (5,4) (step 1), then LEFT to (5,3) (step 2) which is apple).\n\nSo moving LEFT now is better because it's a direct path to an apple. Also, moving UP is invalid (hits body), moving RIGHT is invalid (reverse direction). So the only valid directions are LEFT and DOWN. Between them, LEFT is better because it can reach an apple in the next step. So the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSS  #\n# SSS  #\n#  ASSS#\n#  A HS#\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake's head is at (row 5, column 5). The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). We need to check possible directions: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (5,5) leads to (4,5). Row 4, column 5 is 'S' (snake's body), causing a self-collision. UP is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5,5) leads to (6,5). Row 6, column 5 is empty (safe), but moving DOWN further would risk hitting the bottom wall (row 7 is a wall).  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,5) leads to (5,4), which is empty (safe). Continuing LEFT in the next epoch would reach (5,3), an apple ('A'), allowing the snake to grow and increase the score.  \n\nLEFT is the safest and most optimal direction to reach an apple quickly. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSS # (so positions (1,1) is ' ', (1,2) 'S', (1,3) 'S', (1,4) 'S', (1,5) 'S', (1,6) ' ')\nRow 2: # SSS  # (positions (2,1) ' ', (2,2) 'S', (2,3) 'S', (2,4) 'S', (2,5) ' ', (2,6) ' ')\nRow 3: # SSS  # (positions (3,1) ' ', (3,2) 'S', (3,3) 'S', (3,4) 'S', (3,5) ' ', (3,6) ' ')\nRow 4: #  ASSS# (positions (4,1) ' ', (4,2) ' ', (4,3) 'A', (4,4) 'S', (4,5) 'S', (4,6) 'S')\nRow 5: #  AHSS# (positions (5,1) ' ', (5,2) ' ', (5,3) 'A', (5,4) 'H', (5,5) 'S', (5,6) 'S')\nRow 6: #A     # (positions (6,1) 'A', (6,2) ' ', (6,3) ' ', (6,4) ' ', (6,5) ' ', (6,6) ' ')\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at (5,4). The current direction is LEFT. Since the snake can't reverse direction, if the current direction is LEFT, the snake can't immediately turn RIGHT. The possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since LEFT is current direction, but maybe it can continue moving left, but let's check where that leads).\n\nFirst, let's track the snake's body. The body is 'S's. Let's list all the 'S' positions and 'H' (head) position.\n\nH is at (5,4). Let's see the adjacent S's to determine the direction the snake is moving. Since the current direction is LEFT, the snake was moving left, so the next position would be (5,3). Let's confirm the body's positions. The snake's body is a sequence. Let's see:\n\nLooking at row 5: #  AHSS#. So (5,4) is H, (5,5) S, (5,6) S. Then row 4: #  ASSS#. (4,4) S, (4,5) S, (4,6) S. Row 3: # SSS  #. (3,2) S, (3,3) S, (3,4) S. Row 2: # SSS  #. (2,2) S, (2,3) S, (2,4) S. Row 1: # SSSS #. (1,2) S, (1,3) S, (1,4) S, (1,5) S.\n\nWait, perhaps the snake's body is connected. Let's think about the snake's movement. The head is at (5,4), moving LEFT. So the previous position of the head would have been (5,5) (since moving left from (5,5) would take it to (5,4)). Then the body segments follow. So (5,5) is S (since the head was there before moving left), (5,6) is S (the next body part). Then, where else? Let's see:\n\nIf the head is moving left, the body behind it would be in the direction opposite to movement. So, the head (H) is at (5,4). The next segment (body) is at (5,5) (since moving left, the previous head position is (5,5)), then (5,6), then (4,6) (since the snake might have turned up\/down before). Let's check row 4: (4,6) is S. Then (4,5) S, (4,4) S. Then (3,4) S (row 3), (3,3) S, (3,2) S. (2,4) S (row 2), (2,3) S, (2,2) S. (1,5) S (row 1), (1,4) S, (1,3) S, (1,2) S. That seems to form a connected body.\n\nNow, the snake's next move: the head will move in the direction chosen (must be LEFT, UP, or DOWN, since current direction is LEFT, can't go RIGHT). Let's check each possible direction.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nFirst, moving LEFT: new head position is (5,3). Let's check what's there. In row 5, the position (5,3) is 'A' (from row 5: #  AHSS#. So positions (5,1) ' ', (5,2) ' ', (5,3) 'A', (5,4) 'H', (5,5) 'S', (5,6) 'S'). So (5,3) is an apple. If the snake moves LEFT into (5,3), it will eat the apple. Then the snake grows by 1, so the body doesn't lose the tail (since when you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake's length increases). So moving LEFT here would be good because it eats an apple. Also, check if (5,3) is a wall or body. (5,3) is within the board (rows 0-7, columns 0-7, assuming rows are 0-7 and columns 0-7, with (row, column). The walls are at column 0 and 7, row 0 and 7. (5,3) is row 5, column 3. Columns 0 is wall, 7 is wall. So (5,3) is safe (not a wall). Also, check if (5,3) is a body part. The current body parts are all the 'S's. (5,3) is 'A', so no collision. So moving LEFT here is safe and will eat an apple. That's a good move.\n\nNext, check moving UP. If the direction is UP, the new head position is (4,4). Let's check (4,4). Row 4: #  ASSS#. So (4,4) is 'S' (since (4,4) is part of the 'SSS' in row 4, column 4). So (4,4) is a body segment. So moving UP would cause the head to collide with the body, which ends the game. So UP is invalid.\n\nNext, check moving DOWN. Direction DOWN: new head position is (6,4). Let's check (6,4). Row 6: #A     #. So (6,1) is 'A', (6,2)-(6,6) are spaces. So (6,4) is a space. Is (6,4) a wall? No, row 6 is within 0-7, column 4 is 0-7. So (6,4) is safe. But is there a body part there? The current body parts are all the 'S's. (6,4) is a space, so no collision. So moving DOWN is possible, but does it eat an apple? (6,4) is a space, so no. So moving DOWN would just move the head to (6,4), and the tail would move (since the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail is removed). But moving LEFT gives an apple, which is better. So moving LEFT is better.\n\nSo the best direction is LEFT. Let's confirm again. Current direction is LEFT. The next head position when moving LEFT is (5,3), which is an 'A' (apple). So the snake eats it, grows, and the score increases. No collision. So the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSS #\n# SSS  #\n# SSS  #\n#  ASSS#\n#  AHSS#\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5,4) (row 5, column 4), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). We need to evaluate possible directions (LEFT, UP, DOWN) for safety and apple consumption.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (5,3). Checking (5,3) on the board: it is an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or body collision), and eating the apple increases the score.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (4,4). Checking (4,4) on the board: it is a body segment ('S'). This causes a self-collision, ending the game.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (6,4). This is a safe empty space (' '), but no apple is present here.  \n\nThe best choice is to move LEFT, as it safely eats an apple and avoids collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' as walls. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # SSSS # → So columns 1-5 are part of the snake's body, with 'S's. The structure here is from column 1 to 5: positions (1,1) to (1,5) are 'S'.\nRow 2: # SSS  # → Columns 1-3: (2,1) to (2,3) are 'S'.\nRow 3: #ASSS  # → Column 1 is 'A' (apple), then columns 2-4 are 'S's. So (3,1) is 'A', (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) are 'S'.\nRow 4: #  ASSS# → Columns 2-4 are 'A's, then columns 5-7 (since row 4 is \"#  ASSS#\", so columns 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: 'A', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: 'S'). So (4,3), (4,4) are 'A's, (4,5), (4,6), (4,7) are 'S's.\nRow 5: #  HSSS# → Columns 2: ' ', 3: 'H' (head), 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: 'S'. So the head 'H' is at (5,3). The current direction is LEFT, which means the snake is moving left (so the next position the head would go is (5,2) if direction is LEFT).\nRow 6: #A     # → Column 1 is 'A' (apple), others are spaces. So (6,1) is 'A'.\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nNow, the snake's body is made up of 'S's. The head is 'H' at (5,3). The current direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction, so from LEFT, it can't go RIGHT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (since reversing is not allowed, LEFT to RIGHT is reverse, so RIGHT is invalid). Wait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So if current direction is LEFT, the snake can turn to UP or DOWN, but not RIGHT (since LEFT and RIGHT are opposites). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.\n\nThe next step is to check where the head would move in each possible direction and see if it's safe (no collision with walls or itself), and if it's an apple.\n\nFirst, let's note the head's current position: (row 5, column 3). Let's use (row, column) where rows are 0-7 and columns 0-7 (since the board is 8x8). Wait, the rows are 0 (top) to 7 (bottom). Let's adjust the coordinates correctly. Let's index rows from top (0) to bottom (7), and columns from left (0) to right (7). So for each row, the first character is column 0 (the left wall), and the last is column 7 (the right wall).\n\nRow 0: ######## → columns 0-7 are '#'\nRow 1: # SSSS # → columns 0 is '#', column 1 is ' ', 2 is 'S', 3 is 'S', 4 is 'S', 5 is 'S', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'\nWait, let's parse each row properly, character by character. Let's take row 1: \"# SSSS #\". So the characters are: [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] 'S', [3] 'S', [4] 'S', [5] 'S', [6] ' ', [7] '#'\n\nRow 2: \"# SSS  #\" → [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] 'S', [3] 'S', [4] 'S', [5] ' ', [6] ' ', [7] '#'\n\nRow 3: \"#ASSS  #\" → [0] '#', [1] 'A', [2] 'S', [3] 'S', [4] 'S', [5] ' ', [6] ' ', [7] '#'\n\nRow 4: \"#  ASSS#\" → [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] ' ', [3] 'A', [4] 'A', [5] 'S', [6] 'S', [7] '#'\n\nRow 5: \"#  HSSS#\" → [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] ' ', [3] 'H', [4] 'S', [5] 'S', [6] 'S', [7] '#'\n\nRow 6: \"#A     #\" → [0] '#', [1] 'A', [2] ' ', [3] ' ', [4] ' ', [5] ' ', [6] ' ', [7] '#'\n\nSo the head 'H' is at (row 5, column 3).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So when moving LEFT, the head would move to (row 5, column 2). Let's check that position. Column 2 in row 5 is ' ' (from row 5: \"#  HSSS#\", so column 2 is ' '). So moving LEFT would take the head to (5,2), which is a space. Is there a body part there? Let's check all 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1: columns 2,3,4,5 → (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\nRow 2: columns 2,3,4 → (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: columns 2,3,4 → (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\nRow 4: columns 5,6,7 → (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\nRow 5: columns 4,5,6,7 → (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\nSo (5,2) is not an 'S', so safe. Also, (5,2) is within the board (row 5 is between 0 and 7, column 2 is between 0 and 7, and column 2 is not a wall (walls are columns 0 and 7 in all rows). So moving LEFT is possible, but what's there? It's a space. So no apple, so the snake would move there, and the tail would move (since length is fixed unless it eats an apple). But the current length is the number of 'S's plus 1 (the head). Let's count the 'S's:\n\nRow 1: 4 S's\nRow 2: 3 S's\nRow 3: 3 S's\nRow 4: 3 S's\nRow 5: 4 S's\nTotal S's: 4+3+3+3+4 = 17. So the snake's length is 17 + 1 (head) = 18. So when moving, the tail (the last 'S') would be removed unless the head eats an apple. But since moving LEFT to (5,2) is a space, no apple, so the tail would move.\n\nNow, possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (since current direction is LEFT, can't go RIGHT).\n\nLet's check UP direction. UP means the head moves from (5,3) to (4,3). What's at (4,3)? Looking at row 4: \"#  ASSS#\", column 3 is 'A' (apple). So moving UP would take the head to (4,3), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple would increase the score and the snake would grow (so the tail doesn't get removed). Now, check if (4,3) is a body part. The 'S's are in (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), so (4,3) is 'A' (not 'S'), so safe. Also, (4,3) is within the board (row 4 is valid, column 3 is between 0 and 7, not a wall). So moving UP would eat the apple. That's a good move.\n\nCheck DOWN direction: the head would move from (5,3) to (6,3). What's at (6,3)? Row 6 is \"#A     #\", so column 3 is ' ' (space). Is that a body part? The 'S's are in other rows, (6,3) is not an 'S', so safe. But there's no apple there, so moving DOWN would just move to a space.\n\nCheck LEFT direction again: (5,2) is ' ', no apple, so no growth.\n\nSo the best option is to move UP, which allows the snake to eat an apple. Let's confirm if moving UP is allowed. The current direction is LEFT. The allowed directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since can't reverse to RIGHT). So UP is allowed (not the opposite direction). So moving UP is a valid direction. So the answer should be UP.\n\n\n########\n# SSSS #\n# SSS  #\n#ASSS  #\n#  ASSS#\n#  HSSS#\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 5, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so RIGHT is invalid. Possible directions: UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.\n- **Collision Check**: Need to avoid walls (boundary '#') and self ('S').\n- **Apple Check**: Eating 'A' increases score and snake length.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**: The head would move to (5, 2). This position is empty (' '), no collision, but no apple. The snake does not grow.\n2. **DOWN**: The head would move to (6, 3). This position is empty (' '), no collision, but no apple. The snake does not grow.\n3. **UP**: The head would move to (4, 3). This position contains an apple ('A'). No collision (no 'S' or wall here). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake.\n\n**Best Move**: UP, as it allows the snake to eat an apple safely.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n# SSSS #\n# SSS  #\n#ASSS  #\n#  HSSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#A    A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the current epoch is 43. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. The apples are 'A'. The snake can't reverse direction, so since it's moving UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. The possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse).\n\nFirst, let's locate the head. Looking at the board, the head 'H' is in row 4 (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top). Let's check each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSS # → columns 1-5: S S S S (since # at 0 and 7)\nRow 2: # SSS  # → columns 1-3: S S S\nRow 3: #ASSS  # → column 1 is A, 2-4: S S S\nRow 4: #  HSSS# → columns 2 is H, 3-5: S S S (since 0 and 7 are #)\nRow 5: #  SSSS# → columns 2-5: S S S S\nRow 6: #A    A# → column 1 is A, column 6 is A (columns 0 and 7 are #)\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo the head (H) is at position (row 4, column 2). The current direction is UP, which means the next move would be to row 3, column 2 if we continue UP. Let's check where that position is.\n\nRow 3 is \"#ASSS  #\". Column 2 in row 3 is 'S' (since row 3: index 0 is #, 1 is A, 2 is S, 3 is S, 4 is S, 5 is space, 6 is space, 7 is #). So if the snake moves UP (current direction), the head would go to (3,2), which is a 'S' (body). That's a self-collision, which would end the game. So moving UP is bad.\n\nSo the snake can't go UP (since next position is body). So we need to choose between LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse of UP, which is not allowed). Let's check possible directions:\n\nPossible directions: LEFT, RIGHT (since UP leads to collision, DOWN is reverse).\n\nCheck LEFT direction: Moving LEFT would mean the head (row 4, column 2) moves to (4,1). Let's check (4,1). The row 4 is \"#  HSSS#\", which is columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: H, 3:S, 4:S, 5:S, 6: #. So (4,1) is a space (empty). So moving LEFT would take the head to (4,1). Is that safe?\n\nThen check if that position is a wall or body. (4,1) is in row 4, column 1. The cell is a space, so not a wall (walls are #). Is there a body part there? Looking at the current board, row 4 has \"#  HSSS#\" → column 1 is space. So moving LEFT to (4,1) is safe.\n\nCheck RIGHT direction: Moving RIGHT from (4,2) would go to (4,3). The current (4,3) is 'S' (since row 4 is \"#  HSSS#\", column 3 is S). So moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,3), which is a body part. That's a collision, so RIGHT is bad.\n\nSo the only possible directions are LEFT. Because UP leads to collision, RIGHT leads to collision, DOWN is reverse (invalid). So the next direction should be LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSS #\n# SSS  #\n#ASSS  #\n#  HSSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#A    A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at (row 4, column 2) and is currently moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Let's analyze possible moves:\n\n- **UP**: The next position would be (row 3, column 2), which is occupied by the snake's body (S). This causes a self-collision, ending the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: The next position would be (row 4, column 3), which is occupied by the snake's body (S). This also causes a self-collision.  \n- **LEFT**: The next position is (row 4, column 1), which is empty (no wall or body). This is a safe move.  \n\nThus, the only valid and safe direction is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's state. Let's start by visualizing the board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' as walls. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # SSS  # (so positions 1,2,3 are S)\nRow 2: # SSS  # (positions 1,2,3 are S)\nRow 3: #ASSS  # (position 1 is A, positions 2,3,4 are S)\nRow 4: # HSSSS# (position 1 is H, positions 2,3,4,5 are S)\nRow 5: #  SSSS# (positions 3,4,5,6 are S)\nRow 6: #A    A# (position 1 is A, position 6 is A)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe snake's head is 'H' at row 4, column 1 (since rows are 0-7 and columns 0-7, with the first # being column 0). The current direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. Let's check where the head would move next if direction remains LEFT. Moving left from (4,1) would take it to (4,0), which is a wall (since column 0 is part of the #). That's a collision with the wall, so the game would end. So we can't keep moving LEFT.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is LEFT, so reversing would be RIGHT. So the snake can't turn RIGHT (since that's the opposite of LEFT). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. But LEFT is bad (wall), so options are UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check the positions. The head is at (4,1). Let's list the possible next positions for each direction:\n\n- LEFT: (4,0) → wall → lose.\n- RIGHT: (4,2) → current direction is LEFT, can't reverse. So invalid direction.\n- UP: (3,1). Let's check what's at (3,1). Looking at row 3: #ASSS  #. So row 3, column 1 is 'A' (apple). Oh, that's an apple! So if the snake moves UP, the head goes to (3,1), which is an apple. Then, the snake would eat it, grow, and the score increases. Also, need to check if (3,1) is part of the snake's body. Let's see the current snake body. The snake's body is all the 'S's. Let's map the S positions:\n\nRow 1: columns 1,2,3 → (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\nRow 2: columns 1,2,3 → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\nRow 3: columns 2,3,4 → (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\nRow 4: columns 2,3,4,5 → (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\nRow 5: columns 3,4,5,6 → (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\nHead is at (4,1). So the body is all the S's, which are the positions above. The position (3,1) is A, not S. So moving UP to (3,1) is safe (no collision with self). So that's a good move. The snake would eat the apple here.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN? The head is at (4,1). Moving DOWN would take it to (5,1). Let's check (5,1). Row 5 is #  SSSS#. So columns 0 is #, 1 is space (since the row is \"#  SSSS#\", so columns 0 is #, 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is S, 4 S, 5 S, 6 S, 7 #). So (5,1) is empty (a space). But we need to check if that's part of the snake's body. The snake's body in row 5 is columns 3-6 (positions (5,3)-(5,6)). So (5,1) is not part of the body, so moving DOWN to (5,1) is safe. But there's no apple there. So moving DOWN would just move the snake, no apple eaten.\n\nSo the options are UP (eat apple, safe) or DOWN (no apple, safe). Since the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, choosing UP would be better. Also, we need to make sure that after moving UP, the next direction can be adjusted, but since the current epoch is 44 (well before 100), we can proceed.\n\nSo the best direction is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSS  #\n# SSS  #\n#ASSS  #\n# HSSSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#A    A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,1) (row 4, column 1), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Moving LEFT would take the head to (4,0), which is a wall (collision, game over). \n\nPossible valid directions are UP or DOWN:\n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (3,1). Checking row 3: \"#ASSS  #\", column 1 is 'A' (an apple). This position is not part of the snake's body (current body segments are all 'S' positions, which do not include (3,1)). Eating the apple is safe and increases the score.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (5,1). Row 5 is \"#  SSSS#\", column 1 is empty (no apple) and not part of the snake's body (body segments in row 5 start at column 3). This move is safe but does not eat an apple.\n\nTo maximize apples eaten, the optimal direction is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#SH   A#\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, let's look at the current game board. The board is 8x8 with walls around. The snake's head is 'H' at position (4,2) if we count rows from top as 0. The current direction is UP, and the epoch is 1, so the game is just starting.\n\nFirst, let's list out the positions. The board is:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #A     # → So positions (1,1) is A, others are empty except walls.\nRow 2: #     A# → (2,6) is A.\nRow 3: #      # → all empty.\nRow 4: #  H   # → (4,3) is H (since row 4, columns 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 space, 3 H, 4 space, 5 space, 6 space, 7 #). Wait, maybe I should index rows starting from 0. Let's correct that. Let's index rows 0-7 (top to bottom). So:\n\nRow 0: ######## (row 0)\nRow 1: #A     # → columns 0 is #, 1 is A, 2-6 are spaces, 7 is #. So (1,1) is A.\nRow 2: #     A# → (2,6) is A (row 2, column 6).\nRow 3: #      # → all spaces except walls.\nRow 4: #  H   # → (4,3) is H (row 4, column 3).\nRow 5: #A     # → (5,1) is A.\nRow 6: #      # → all spaces.\nRow 7: ######## (row 7)\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The snake moves one square at a time in the current direction. But the player can change direction, as long as it's not the reverse. Since current direction is UP, the reverse is DOWN, so the possible directions the player can choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't go DOWN directly).\n\nWait, the rules say: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So current direction is UP, so the next direction can't be DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWe need to choose a direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) but DOWN is invalid (reverse). So possible options are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, the snake's head is at (4,3). Let's see where moving in each possible direction would take it.\n\nCurrent direction is UP. If we choose to continue moving UP (direction UP), the next position of the head would be row 3, column 3 (since moving up decreases the row index by 1). Let's check that cell. Row 3, column 3 is part of row 3, which is \"#      #\", so (3,3) is a space. So moving UP would take the head to (3,3). Since that's empty, no collision, no apple. The snake would move there, and since no apple, the body doesn't grow (since the snake starts with length 1, moving without eating would just move the head, and the body (if any) follows. But initial length is 1, so after moving, the head is at (3,3), and there's no body. So that's safe.\n\nIf we choose LEFT: direction LEFT. Moving left from (4,3) would take the head to (4,2). Let's check (4,2). The row 4 is \"#  H   #\", so (4,2) is a space (since H is at 3). So (4,2) is empty. No collision, no apple. So safe.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: direction RIGHT. Moving right from (4,3) is (4,4). (4,4) is a space. So that's safe.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: direction DOWN. But that's reverse of current direction (UP), which is not allowed. So can't choose DOWN.\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's check where the apples are. Apples are at (1,1), (2,6), (5,1).\n\nThe snake's current head is at (4,3). Let's see which direction would get it closer to an apple.\n\nIf moving UP (to 3,3), next position. Then, the next move (epoch 2) would be in whatever direction we choose then. But maybe we can plan a path to reach an apple.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the positions of apples:\n\nApple at (1,1) (row 1, column 1). That's top-left area.\n\nApple at (2,6) (row 2, column 6). Top-right.\n\nApple at (5,1) (row 5, column 1). Middle-left.\n\nThe snake is at (4,3). Let's see distances. The apple at (5,1) is row 5, column 1. From (4,3), moving down (but current direction is UP, so can't go down now. But maybe after moving up, can change direction.\n\nAlternatively, moving left from (4,3) to (4,2), then maybe left again (if possible) towards (5,1) (which is row 5, column 1). Let's see: (4,3) → LEFT to (4,2) → LEFT to (4,1). Then, if direction is LEFT again, (4,0) is a wall (since column 0 is #), so can't. So perhaps move down (but current direction is UP, so next direction can't be DOWN. So maybe after moving LEFT once, next direction could be DOWN (since previous direction was LEFT, so reverse would be RIGHT, so DOWN is allowed).\n\nAlternatively, let's check if any of the possible next moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) would land on an apple.\n\nCurrent head position (4,3). Next positions:\n\nUP: (3,3) → is there an apple? The apples are at (1,1), (2,6), (5,1). (3,3) is empty. So no.\n\nLEFT: (4,2) → empty.\n\nRIGHT: (4,4) → empty.\n\nSo none of the immediate next moves would eat an apple. So we need to choose a direction that allows the snake to reach an apple in the next steps, avoiding walls and self-collision.\n\nLet's think about the apple at (5,1). That's in row 5, column 1. The snake is in row 4, column 3. To get to (5,1), the snake would need to move down (to row 5) and left (to column 1). But current direction is UP, so moving down is not allowed next step. So perhaps first move left a few times, then down.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,1) is in row 1, column 1. To reach there, the snake would need to move up (since current direction is UP), then left.\n\nThe apple at (2,6) is in row 2, column 6. To reach there, the snake would need to move up (to row 3, then 2), then right.\n\nLet's evaluate possible paths.\n\nOption 1: Continue moving UP. Next position (3,3). Then, possible directions: current direction would be UP, so next direction can't be DOWN. So possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. From (3,3), moving UP would go to (2,3). Then, (2,3) is in row 2, which is \"#     A#\". (2,3) is a space, safe. Then, perhaps move right towards (2,6) (the apple there). From (2,3), moving right would take to (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) which is the apple. That's 3 steps. So if we go UP, then UP, then RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, we can reach that apple.\n\nOption 2: Move LEFT. Next position (4,2). Then, direction could be LEFT again (since previous direction was LEFT, reverse is RIGHT, so allowed). So (4,2) → LEFT to (4,1). (4,1) is in row 4, which is \"#  H   #\". So (4,1) is a space. Then, direction could be DOWN (since previous direction was LEFT, reverse is RIGHT, so DOWN is allowed). From (4,1), moving DOWN to (5,1) which is the apple. That's two steps: LEFT, then DOWN. So that's a shorter path. Let's check:\n\nCurrent head (4,3). If we choose LEFT, next head is (4,2) (epoch 2). Then, in epoch 2, the current direction would be LEFT (since we changed direction to LEFT). So in epoch 2, the possible directions can't be RIGHT (reverse of LEFT). So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. If in epoch 2, we choose DOWN (since direction is LEFT, reverse is RIGHT, so DOWN is allowed). Then, the head moves from (4,2) down to (5,2). Wait, no. Wait, the direction in epoch 2 would be whatever we choose. Let's clarify:\n\nIn epoch 1, current direction is UP. We choose direction LEFT. So the snake moves LEFT (from (4,3) to (4,2)). Now, the new current direction is LEFT (since that's the direction we input). So in epoch 2, the possible directions can't be RIGHT (reverse of LEFT). So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nIf in epoch 2, we choose DOWN (allowed, since not reverse), then the head moves from (4,2) down to (5,2). Then, in epoch 3, direction could be DOWN again (current direction is DOWN, so reverse is UP). So from (5,2), moving DOWN to (6,2). Not helpful. Alternatively, from (4,2), moving LEFT again to (4,1). Then, (4,1) is a space. Then, direction is LEFT, so next possible directions are LEFT (can't, since (4,0) is a wall), UP, or DOWN. If we go DOWN from (4,1), then (5,1) is the apple. So:\n\nEpoch 1: choose LEFT → head at (4,2), direction LEFT.\n\nEpoch 2: choose LEFT → head at (4,1), direction LEFT.\n\nEpoch 3: choose DOWN → head moves from (4,1) down to (5,1) → which is the apple. So that's 3 steps. But that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, in epoch 1, choose LEFT, then in epoch 2, choose DOWN. Let's see:\n\nEpoch 1: direction LEFT → head (4,2), direction LEFT.\n\nEpoch 2: direction DOWN → head moves from (4,2) down to (5,2). Now, (5,2) is in row 5: \"#A     #\". So (5,2) is a space. Then, in epoch 3, direction could be LEFT (since current direction is DOWN, reverse is UP). So moving LEFT from (5,2) to (5,1) → which is the apple. That's 3 steps as well.\n\nHmm, but maybe the apple at (5,1) is closer. Let's check the positions. The apple at (5,1) is in row 5, column 1. The snake is at (4,3). The distance in rows is 1 (down), columns 2 (left). So if the snake can move left twice and down once, it can reach there.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards the apple at (2,6). Let's see: (4,3) → UP to (3,3) (epoch 1). Then, UP to (2,3) (epoch 2). Then, RIGHT to (2,4) (epoch 3), RIGHT to (2,5) (epoch4), RIGHT to (2,6) (epoch5). That's 5 steps. So longer than the path to (5,1).\n\nThe third apple is (1,1). That's even higher up. So (4,3) → UP to (3,3) → UP (2,3) → UP (1,3) → LEFT (1,2) → LEFT (1,1). That's 5 steps as well.\n\nSo the closest apple is (5,1), which can be reached in 3 steps if we move left and then down.\n\nSo the best first move would be to go LEFT, to start moving towards (5,1). Because moving LEFT now (epoch 1) would take us to (4,2), which is a safe position, and then we can proceed towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we move RIGHT, then we're moving away from the apples. So RIGHT is probably not good.\n\nSo the optimal first move is LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's current position, available apples, and movement constraints. The snake's head ('H') is at row 4, column 3 (0-indexed). The current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apples Position**: Apples are at (1,1), (2,6), and (5,1). The closest apple is (5,1) (row 5, column 1), which is 1 row down and 2 columns left from the snake's current position.\n2. **Movement Options**:\n   - **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,3), a safe but empty cell. This moves the snake away from the nearest apple (5,1).\n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,4), a safe but empty cell. This moves the snake away from all apples.\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (4,2), a safe cell. This positions the snake closer to the nearest apple (5,1) and allows subsequent moves (e.g., LEFT again to (4,1), then DOWN to (5,1)) to reach the apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is optimal as it positions the snake to approach the nearest apple (5,1) in subsequent steps, maximizing the chance to eat an apple and grow.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#'. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A     # (so position (1,1) is A)\nRow 2: #     A# (position (2,6) is A)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: # H    # (so the head H is at (4,2))\nRow 5: #A     # (position (5,1) is A)\nRow 6: #      # (empty)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. Since the snake can't reverse direction, if the current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since LEFT is the current direction, it's allowed to continue).\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,2). Let's confirm the coordinates. Rows are 0-7 (top to bottom), columns 0-7 (left to right). So each row is a string, index 0 is the first character. So for row 4: \"# H    #\", the characters are [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] 'H', [3] ' ', [4] ' ', [5] ' ', [6] ' ', [7] '#'. So H is at (row 4, column 2). \n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So the next position if moving LEFT would be (4, 1). Let's check that position. What's at (4,1)? In row 4, column 1 is a space ' ', so that's empty. But if we move LEFT, the new head is (4,1), and since the snake's length is 1 (since it's the start, unless it has eaten apples already). Wait, the problem says the snake starts with length 1 (just the head). The current epoch is 2. Let's see, epoch 1 would be the first move. But maybe the initial state is epoch 0? The example given starts with a direction and then after moving, the next state. So the current state here is after epoch 2. So the snake's length is 1 unless it has eaten apples. Let's check if the snake has eaten any apples so far.\n\nLooking at the initial positions: The snake's head was at (4,2) in the current board. Let's think about previous moves. The snake starts moving UP. Let's retrace. Let's see, the initial position before any moves (epoch 0) would have the head somewhere, but in the current board, the head is at (4,2). Current direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction. So previous direction before LEFT must have been a direction that's not RIGHT. Let's not get stuck on that. Let's focus on the current state.\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,2). The current direction is LEFT, so moving left would take it to (4,1). Let's check that cell. In row 4, column 1 is ' ', so not a wall, not a body part (since the snake is length 1, no body). So that's safe. But are there apples nearby? Let's check the apples on the board.\n\nApples are at (1,1), (2,6), (5,1). So (1,1) is row 1, column 1. (5,1) is row 5, column 1. The head is at (4,2). If we move LEFT to (4,1), that's adjacent to (5,1) (row 5, column 1) which is an apple. So (4,1) is (row 4, column 1), (5,1) is row 5, column 1: that's directly below (4,1). So if the snake moves LEFT to (4,1), then next possible moves could be towards (5,1) (DOWN) to eat that apple.\n\nAlternatively, let's check other possible directions. The snake can choose UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since current direction is LEFT, can't go RIGHT).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. Possible next directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n1. LEFT: Next head position is (4,1). What's there? In row 4, column 1: the cell is ' ' (from the current board: \"# H    #\" → positions 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is 'H', etc.). So moving LEFT to (4,1) is safe (no wall, no body). The snake's length is 1, so no body to collide with. So that's a valid move. After moving, the new head is (4,1), and since there's no apple there (the apples are at (1,1), (2,6), (5,1)), so no apple eaten. The score remains the same. The next direction could be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again (since can't reverse).\n\n2. UP: Current head is (4,2). Moving UP would take it to (3,2). Let's check (3,2). The row 3 is \"#      #\", so column 2 is ' ', so safe. No apple there. So moving UP is safe. Then the new direction would be UP. Next possible directions could be LEFT, RIGHT (but can't reverse from UP, so can't go DOWN). Wait, the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if the current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. But here, the current direction is LEFT, and we're considering changing direction to UP. Since UP is not the reverse of LEFT (reverse of LEFT is RIGHT), so that's allowed. So changing direction to UP is allowed. The new head position is (3,2). No apple there. So safe.\n\n3. DOWN: Current head is (4,2). Moving DOWN would take it to (5,2). Let's check row 5: \"#A     #\". So column 2 in row 5 is ' ' (since row 5 is \"#A     #\": positions 0 is '#', 1 is 'A', 2 is ' ', 3 is ' ', etc.). So (5,2) is ' ', safe. No apple there. So moving DOWN is safe. Then new direction is DOWN. Next possible directions can't be UP (reverse).\n\nNow, the goal is to eat as many apples as possible. Let's see where the apples are. The apples are at (1,1), (2,6), (5,1). The head is at (4,2). Let's see the distances.\n\nApple at (5,1): row 5, column 1. The head is at (4,2). So to reach (5,1), the snake would need to move DOWN (from (4,2) to (5,2)), then LEFT (to (5,1)). Alternatively, move LEFT first to (4,1), then DOWN to (5,1). Let's see.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT (current direction), head goes to (4,1). Then the next move could be DOWN, which would take it to (5,1), which is an apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT now would set up the next move to eat the apple at (5,1).\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN now, head goes to (5,2). Then moving LEFT would take it to (5,1) (the apple), which is also possible. So either LEFT then DOWN, or DOWN then LEFT could reach the apple.\n\nBut let's check if moving LEFT now is better. Let's think about possible collisions. The snake is length 1, so no body, so any move that's not into a wall is safe. The walls are the edges (row 0 and 7, column 0 and 7). So the head's current position is (4,2). Moving LEFT to (4,1): column 1 is within 0-7 (columns 0 is wall, 1 is safe). So (4,1) is safe.\n\nIf we move LEFT, then next possible direction could be DOWN. Let's say we move LEFT now (epoch 2), then in epoch 3, the direction is DOWN. The head would move from (4,1) to (5,1), which is the apple. Then the snake eats the apple, grows, score increases. That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now (epoch 2), then LEFT (epoch 3) to (5,1) (apple). That's also possible. Let's check:\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. If we choose DOWN as the next direction, is that allowed? Yes, because the current direction is LEFT, and DOWN is not the reverse (reverse of LEFT is RIGHT). So direction change to DOWN is allowed.\n\nSo, moving DOWN now: head moves from (4,2) to (5,2). Then, next direction could be LEFT (since current direction would be DOWN, and LEFT is allowed, not reverse). Then, moving LEFT from (5,2) to (5,1) (apple). That's also a valid path.\n\nWhich path is better? Let's see the positions. The apple at (5,1) is in row 5, column 1. So if we move DOWN first, the head is at (5,2), then LEFT to (5,1). That's one move. If we move LEFT first, head at (4,1), then DOWN to (5,1). Also one move. Both options take two moves (epoch 2 and 3) to reach the apple. But perhaps the immediate next move (epoch 3) can reach the apple.\n\nBut let's check if there are other apples. The other apples are at (1,1) and (2,6). (1,1) is in row 1, column 1. That's top-left area. (2,6) is row 2, column 6 (right side). The snake is currently in row 4, column 2, so (5,1) is the closest apple. So the best strategy is to go for the nearest apple.\n\nSo between moving LEFT or DOWN to reach (5,1), which is better? Let's check possible obstacles. Since the snake is length 1, no body, so no collision possible except walls.\n\nIf we move LEFT (current direction) to (4,1), then next direction DOWN to (5,1) (apple). That's safe. So moving LEFT now allows us to reach the apple in the next step.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,2), then LEFT to (5,1). Also safe.\n\nBut let's check the current direction. The current direction is LEFT. If we continue moving LEFT, that's allowed. So the question is, which direction choice now will lead to eating the apple in the next step.\n\nLet's see:\n\nIf we choose LEFT now:\n\n- New head position: (4,1).\n\nEpoch 3: direction can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT. If we choose DOWN, then head moves to (5,1), which is the apple. That's good.\n\nIf we choose DOWN now:\n\n- New head position: (5,2).\n\nEpoch 3: direction can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since current direction is DOWN, can't go UP). Choosing LEFT would move to (5,1), the apple. That's also good.\n\nSo both options are possible. But perhaps one of them is more optimal. Let's check if there's any danger in either path. Since the snake is length 1, there's no body, so no self-collision. So both paths are safe.\n\nBut perhaps the apple at (5,1) is in row 5, column 1. So (5,1) is in row 5, which is the same row as the apple in row 5. So moving LEFT from (5,2) to (5,1) would get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN from (4,1) to (5,1) would get it.\n\nWhich direction should we choose now? Let's think about the current direction. The snake is moving LEFT. If we keep moving LEFT, the next position is (4,1). Then, moving DOWN would be a valid direction. Alternatively, changing direction to DOWN now would take us to (5,2).\n\nBut perhaps the best choice is to move DOWN now. Let's check the head's position. (4,2) moving DOWN is (5,2). The cell (5,2) is safe. Then, moving LEFT from there would reach (5,1) (apple). That's one move. So in epoch 3, if direction is LEFT, then head moves to (5,1), which is the apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now (epoch 2) to (4,1), then in epoch 3, direction DOWN to (5,1) (apple). That's also good.\n\nBut which direction is possible. Since the current direction is LEFT, the player can choose to continue LEFT, or change to UP or DOWN.\n\nAnother thing to consider: Are there any walls in the way? The walls are on the edges (columns 0 and 7, rows 0 and 7). So (4,1) is column 1 (safe, not wall). (5,2) is row 5 (safe, row 7 is the bottom wall). So no walls in the way.\n\nHmm. Maybe either direction is acceptable, but perhaps the best choice is to move DOWN. Let's think again. Let's list the positions:\n\nCurrent head: (4,2) (row 4, column 2).\n\nApples at (1,1), (2,6), (5,1).\n\nThe closest apple in terms of steps is (5,1). Let's calculate the Manhattan distance from head to each apple:\n\nTo (5,1): |4-5| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nTo (1,1): |4-1| + |2-1| = 3 +1=4.\n\nTo (2,6): |4-2| + |2-6|=2 +4=6. So (5,1) is closest.\n\nSo we need to reach (5,1) in as few steps as possible.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (5,1): possible moves. One path is DOWN then LEFT (two steps: (4,2) → (5,2) → (5,1)). Another path is LEFT then DOWN (two steps: (4,2) → (4,1) → (5,1)). Both are two steps.\n\nSo either path is fine. So which direction should we choose now?\n\nIf the current direction is LEFT, and we choose to move LEFT, then next direction can be DOWN. If we choose to move DOWN now, next direction can be LEFT.\n\nBut perhaps the snake should choose the direction that allows it to reach the apple without hitting walls. Since both paths are safe, maybe either is okay. But perhaps the best answer is to move DOWN. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT now is better. Let's see the apple at (5,1) is in row 5, column 1. The cell (4,1) (after moving LEFT) is directly above (5,1). So moving DOWN from (4,1) would reach (5,1) in the next step, which is an apple. So that's a direct path. So moving LEFT now would set up the next move to eat the apple.\n\nYes, that's a good plan. So the direction to choose now is LEFT. Because moving LEFT takes the head to (4,1), and then the next move (epoch 3) can be DOWN to (5,1), which is the apple. That way, in epoch 3, the snake can eat the apple, increasing the score.\n\nAlternatively, if we move DOWN now, the head goes to (5,2), then moving LEFT to (5,1) (apple) in epoch 3. Either way, the apple is eaten in epoch 3. So both directions are possible, but perhaps the question is which is the correct answer. Since the problem says to choose the best direction, but perhaps there's only one correct answer. Let's check the example given.\n\nIn the example, when the direction is DOWN, the head moves and eats an apple. The example's initial head position was in row 3 (assuming 0-based), and moving DOWN to row 4 where there's an apple. So the example shows that moving towards an apple is the right choice.\n\nIn our current case, the apple at (5,1) is in row 5, column 1. The head is at (4,2). So to reach (5,1), the snake can move LEFT to (4,1), then DOWN to (5,1). So moving LEFT now would be the first step towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,2), then LEFT to (5,1). Both are correct. But perhaps the answer is LEFT, as the current direction is LEFT, and continuing in that direction may be allowed. Alternatively, maybe the answer is DOWN. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the snake's current direction is LEFT. So the next move direction can be LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Let's confirm the possible directions again. The snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. So allowed directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT, the head moves to (4,1). What's in (4,1)? The current board's row 4 is \"# H    #\", which is index 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'H', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (4,1) is ' ', safe.\n\nIf the snake moves UP, head moves to (3,2). Row 3 is \"#      #\", so (3,2) is ' ', safe.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN, head moves to (5,2). Row 5 is \"#A     #\", so (5,2) is ' ', safe.\n\nSo all three directions are safe. Now, which one leads to the apple soonest.\n\nThe apple at (5,1) is in row 5, column 1. Let's see the positions:\n\n- If we move LEFT to (4,1), then moving DOWN (next direction) takes us to (5,1) (apple). That's one move away.\n\n- If we move DOWN to (5,2), then moving LEFT (next direction) takes us to (5,1) (apple). Also one move away.\n\n- If we move UP to (3,2), then we're moving away from the apple (5,1), which is in a lower row. So moving UP is not optimal.\n\nSo the best options are LEFT or DOWN.\n\nBut perhaps the answer is DOWN. Let's think: (4,2) moving DOWN to (5,2). Then, the next move LEFT to (5,1) (apple). So in that case, the next move (epoch 3) would be LEFT. Since the current direction after moving DOWN would be DOWN, so the next direction can't be UP. So direction LEFT is allowed. So that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT (current direction) to (4,1), then next direction DOWN (allowed, since current direction would be LEFT, so next direction can be DOWN). Then head moves to (5,1) (apple).\n\nEither direction is valid, but perhaps the intended answer is to move DOWN. Alternatively, perhaps moving LEFT is better.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the positions of the other apples. The apple at (1,1) is in row 1, column 1. If the snake moves LEFT to (4,1), then UP to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) could reach that apple. But (5,1) is closer. So the priority is (5,1).\n\nHmm. I think either direction is acceptable, but perhaps the answer is LEFT. Because the current direction is LEFT, and moving LEFT is allowed. But I'm not sure. Let's try to make a decision. Since the snake's current direction is LEFT, and moving LEFT is possible, and that leads towards the apple at (5,1) (since (4,1) is one step away from (5,1) down), I think the best choice is to move LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# H    #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4, 2) (row 4, column 2) and is currently moving LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nKey observations:\n- Apples are located at (1, 1), (2, 6), and (5, 1). The closest apple is at (5, 1) (Manhattan distance of 2 from the head).\n- Moving LEFT (current direction) takes the head to (4, 1), which is safe (no wall or self-collision). From (4, 1), the next move DOWN would reach (5, 1) (the apple), allowing the snake to eat it in the next epoch.\n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (5, 2), and a subsequent LEFT move would also reach (5, 1). However, moving LEFT first aligns with the current direction and positions the snake to directly approach the nearest apple in the next step.\n\nThus, the optimal direction is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8 with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A     # → So positions (1,1) is 'A' (since rows are 0-indexed, columns too)\nRow 2: #     A# → (2,6) is 'A'\nRow 3: #      # → empty\nRow 4: #H     # → (4,1) is 'H' (head)\nRow 5: #A     # → (5,1) is 'A'\nRow 6: #      # → empty\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. Since the snake can't reverse direction, the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing LEFT would be RIGHT, which is not allowed). Wait, wait. The rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So current direction is LEFT. Reversing would be RIGHT, which is not allowed. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (since LEFT is the current direction, can keep moving left). So the next direction can be LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\nNow, the snake's head is at (4,1). Let's note the coordinates. Let's assume rows are 0 (top) to 7 (bottom), columns 0 (left) to 7 (right). So the head is in row 4, column 1.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So if the snake continues moving LEFT, the next position would be (4,0). But column 0 is a wall (since the first character of each row is '#'). So moving LEFT would cause a collision with the wall, which ends the game. That's bad. So we can't choose LEFT.\n\nSo possible directions are UP or DOWN. Let's check those.\n\nIf direction is UP: the snake's head would move from (4,1) up to (3,1). Let's check what's there. Row 3 is \"#      #\", so (3,1) is empty (since row 3, column 1 is the second character, which is a space). So moving UP would take the head to (3,1). Since that's empty, no collision. The snake's body (since current length is 1, there's no body yet) so no self-collision. So that's safe.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: head moves from (4,1) down to (5,1). Let's check (5,1). Row 5 is \"#A     #\", so column 1 is 'A'. Oh, there's an apple there! So moving DOWN would make the snake eat the apple. That's good because it increases the score and the snake grows. So the next head position is (5,1), which is an apple. So that's a valid move.\n\nNow, need to check if moving DOWN is allowed. Since current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. DOWN is allowed. So moving DOWN is possible.\n\nLet's confirm the positions again. Head is at (4,1). Current direction LEFT. Next possible directions: UP (from (4,1) to (3,1)), DOWN (from (4,1) to (5,1)), or LEFT (from (4,1) to (4,0) which is a wall). So LEFT is invalid. So options are UP or DOWN.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: head moves to (5,1), which is an 'A'. So the snake eats the apple. The snake's length increases by 1. The apple at (5,1) is removed, and a new apple might be placed (but the example shows that after eating, the apple is replaced. The example's initial board had A's, and after moving down, the head is at the A's position, and the previous head becomes S. So in this case, moving down to (5,1) (which is A) would result in the head moving there, the previous head (4,1) becomes part of the body (S). So the new board would have H at (5,1), S at (4,1), and the A at (5,1) is gone. Then, since the snake grows, the length is now 2. Also, the score increases by 1.\n\nIs there any collision in moving DOWN? (5,1) is an apple, not a wall or body. So no collision. So that's a safe move.\n\nIf we choose UP: head moves to (3,1). That's empty. No apple, so the snake doesn't grow. The previous head (4,1) becomes S (since the snake moves, the body follows). So the snake's length remains 1? Wait, no. The snake starts with length 1. When it moves, the head moves, and if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (which is the previous head) is removed. Wait, in snake games, when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, it moves forward, so the head moves to a new position, and the tail (last body part) is removed. But in this problem, the initial length is 1 (only head). So when moving, if no apple is eaten, the snake's length remains 1. So the previous head position (4,1) would no longer be part of the snake. Because when the snake moves, the body parts follow. But since the snake's length is 1, there are no body parts. So moving to (3,1) would have the head at (3,1), and the previous position (4,1) is now empty. Because the snake's length is 1. So in that case, the snake remains length 1.\n\nSo moving UP is safe but doesn't get an apple. Moving DOWN gets an apple and grows the snake, which is better. So the best choice is DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#H     #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4,1) (row 4, column 1) and is currently moving LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible next directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (4,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall). This causes a collision, ending the game. This is invalid.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,1), which is empty (no apple, no collision). The snake remains length 1, and no score is gained.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (5,1), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, grows the snake's length, and avoids collision (no wall or self-collision).  \n\nThe best move is DOWN, as it safely eats an apple and grows the snake.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as requested.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#S     #\n#H    A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, and the current epoch is 4. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S'. The snake starts moving in UP direction, but now it's moving DOWN. The snake can't reverse direction, so from DOWN, the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since reversing would be UP, which is not allowed). Wait, the rules say the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is DOWN, the next direction can't be UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\nLet's find the positions of H, S, and A. Let's index the rows from top to bottom as 0 to 7. Columns 0 to 7.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all #)\nRow 1: #A     # → positions (1,1) is A\nRow 2: #     A# → (2,6) is A\nRow 3: #      # → empty\nRow 4: #S     # → (4,1) is S (body)\nRow 5: #H    A# → (5,1) is H (head), (5,6) is A\nRow 6: #      # → empty\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo the snake's head is at (5,1). The body (S) is at (4,1). Since the current direction is DOWN, the previous movement was from (4,1) to (5,1), making the body at (4,1). Because when the snake moves, the head moves in the direction, and the body follows. Since the snake's length is 2 (H and S), moving down would make the head go to (6,1), and the body would be at (5,1) (the previous head position). But let's confirm: initial length 1 (only H), then when it eats an apple, length increases. So if the current body is S, that means the snake has length 2. So the snake's segments are H at (5,1), S at (4,1). The direction is DOWN, so next move, the head would move to (6,1). Let's check possible directions.\n\nPossible directions to choose: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (since UP is reverse). Let's check each option for collision and apple.\n\nCurrent head position: (5,1). Let's list possible next positions:\n\n- If direction is DOWN: next head position is (6,1). Let's check what's there. Row 6 is \"#      #\", so (6,1) is empty (since row 6, column 1 is a space). So the snake moves to (6,1). The body would then move to (5,1) (previous head), and the old body (4,1) would be removed? Wait, no. The snake's length is 2 (H and S). When moving, the head moves, and each body segment follows the previous one. So when moving, the new head is (6,1), the new body is (5,1) (the old head). The old body (4,1) would no longer be part of the snake. So the new board would have H at (6,1), S at (5,1), and (4,1) becomes empty. Then check if (6,1) is an apple. Row 6, column 1 is a space, so no apple. So no growth, score remains same.\n\n- If direction is LEFT: next head position is (5,0). But column 0 is a wall (since row 5 is \"#H    A#\", so column 0 is #). So (5,0) is a wall. Collision with wall, game ends. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n- If direction is RIGHT: next head position is (5,2). Let's check (5,2) in row 5: \"#H    A#\" → positions: (5,0) is #, (5,1) is H, (5,2) is space, (5,3) is space, (5,4) is space, (5,5) is space, (5,6) is A, (5,7) is #. So (5,2) is a space. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (5,2). Then the body would move to (5,1). The old body (4,1) would be empty. Now, (5,2) is empty, so no apple. So snake moves there, no collision, continues.\n\n- What about direction UP? Wait, current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so UP is not allowed. So UP is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's check if moving in these directions leads to apples.\n\nLooking for apples. The apples are at (1,1), (2,6), (5,6). Let's see where the snake can reach those.\n\nCurrent head is at (5,1). The snake is moving DOWN. Let's think about the next steps. Let's check possible moves:\n\nIf we go DOWN to (6,1). Then next possible directions (since direction would now be DOWN). Next move could be DOWN again (to 7,1, which is a wall, since row 7 is all #), so that's bad. Or LEFT\/RIGHT. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, if we go RIGHT to (5,2). Then direction becomes RIGHT (since the new direction is what we choose). Then next moves could be RIGHT, UP, or DOWN (since can't reverse to LEFT). Let's see.\n\nThe apple at (5,6) is in row 5, column 6. The head is at (5,1). To reach (5,6), moving RIGHT multiple times. So if we go RIGHT now, that's a step towards that apple.\n\nIf we go DOWN now, head is at (6,1). Then from there, moving RIGHT would take to (6,2), (6,3), etc. But (5,6) is in row 5, so maybe not as direct.\n\nAnother apple is at (1,1). That's in row 1, column 1. The head is in row 5, column 1. So if the snake moves UP (but current direction is DOWN, can't reverse to UP immediately). So to reach (1,1), the snake would have to go up, but that's only possible if the direction changes to UP, which can't happen from DOWN. So maybe (1,1) is not reachable quickly.\n\nThe apple at (2,6) is in row 2, column 6. To reach there, the snake would need to go right and up.\n\nBut the immediate next step: let's check if moving RIGHT now would lead to any collision. (5,2) is safe. Moving DOWN to (6,1) is also safe.\n\nWhich direction is better? Let's check if moving RIGHT allows the snake to reach an apple sooner. The apple at (5,6) is in the same row (row 5). So moving RIGHT from (5,1) towards (5,6) would get the snake closer. The next positions in row 5 would be (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). So if the snake continues moving RIGHT, it can reach (5,6) in 4 steps (from (5,1) to (5,6) is 5 columns apart, but current position is (5,1), so (5,2) is first step, then (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). So 5 steps. If we go RIGHT now, that's the first step towards that apple.\n\nIf we go DOWN, the head is at (6,1). Then to get to (5,6), the snake would need to go up (but direction is now DOWN, so next direction could be RIGHT, then up perhaps). Maybe that's longer.\n\nAnother thing: check if moving in any direction would cause collision with the body. The current body is at (4,1). So the next positions for the head are (6,1) (DOWN), (5,2) (RIGHT), (5,0) (LEFT, which is wall). The body is at (4,1). So (6,1) is not the body. (5,2) is not the body. So no collision.\n\nSo between DOWN and RIGHT. Which is better? Let's see. The apple at (5,6) is in the same row. So moving RIGHT is better to approach that apple. So choosing RIGHT would be better. Let's confirm.\n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#S     #\n#H    A#\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and collision risks:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head ('H') is at (row 5, column 1). Body ('S') is at (row 4, column 1).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 1, column 1), (row 2, column 6), and (row 5, column 6).\n- **Walls**: The board is bordered by '#' (columns 0 and 7, rows 0 and 7).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: Next head position would be (row 5, column 0), which is a wall. Collision → Game ends. **Invalid**.\n2. **RIGHT**: Next head position is (row 5, column 2) (empty space). No collision. This moves the snake toward the apple at (row 5, column 6) (same row, 4 steps away). **Safe and strategic**.\n3. **DOWN**: Next head position is (row 6, column 1) (empty space). No collision, but this moves the snake away from the nearest apple (row 5, column 6). **Safe but less optimal**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT avoids collision, progresses toward the apple at (row 5, column 6), and is the best choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' walls. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A     # (so columns 1 is A, others are empty except walls)\nRow 2: #     A# (column 6 is A)\nRow 3: #      # (all empty)\nRow 4: #      # (all empty)\nRow 5: #SH   A# (so columns 1 is S, 2 is H, and column 6 is A)\nRow 6: #      # (all empty)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the current epoch is 5. The snake's head is at row 5, column 2 (since row 5 is #SH   A#, so index 1 is S (body), index 2 is H (head)). The body (S) is at row 5, column 1. So the snake is currently moving RIGHT, which means the next move would be to row 5, column 3 (since moving right increases the column index by 1).\n\nWait, the snake's movement: when moving, the head moves in the direction, and the body follows. Since the snake's length is 2 (H and S), when it moves, the head goes to the new position, and the previous head becomes the body, and the tail (the S) would stay unless the snake grows. But if the head moves into an apple, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't disappear. Otherwise, the tail moves forward (i.e., the body shifts).\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction, so it can't go LEFT (since current is RIGHT, reversing would be LEFT). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since the player can choose to change direction as long as it's not reversing).\n\nLet's check where the head is now. Head (H) is at (5,2). The body (S) is at (5,1). The snake is moving RIGHT, so if we keep direction RIGHT, the next head position would be (5,3). Let's check what's there. Looking at row 5: #SH   A#. So columns 0 is #, 1 is S, 2 is H, 3 is (space), 4 is (space), 5 is (space), 6 is A, 7 is #. So (5,3) is empty. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (5,3). Then, the body would move to (5,2) (since the head was there before). The tail (original S at (5,1)) would be removed unless the snake grows. But since (5,3) is empty, no apple eaten, so the snake's length remains 2. The new body positions would be (5,2) (old head) and (5,1) (old body) would be removed. Wait, no: when the snake moves, each part follows the one in front. For a snake of length 2, the head moves to new position, the previous head becomes the body, and the previous body (tail) is removed. So after moving RIGHT, the new positions would be head at (5,3), body at (5,2), and the old body at (5,1) is no longer part of the snake. So the snake's body would now be (5,2) and head at (5,3). \n\nNow, possible directions: the player can choose to change direction to UP, DOWN, or keep RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse). Let's check the possible next positions for each direction.\n\nIf we choose UP: the direction changes to UP. The head is at (5,2). Moving UP would take it to (4,2). Let's check (4,2): row 4 is #      #, so (4,2) is empty. So that's safe. Then, the body would move to (5,2), and the old body (5,1) is removed. No collision, and no apple.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: direction changes to DOWN. Head moves to (6,2). Row 6 is #      #, so (6,2) is empty. Safe.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: head moves to (5,3), as before. Safe.\n\nNow, let's check for apples. The current apples are at (1,1), (2,6), (5,6). The head's current position is (5,2). The next possible positions:\n\n- RIGHT: (5,3) → no apple.\n- UP: (4,2) → no apple.\n- DOWN: (6,2) → no apple.\n\nSo none of the immediate next moves will eat an apple. So we need to look ahead to avoid collisions and plan the path to apples.\n\nThe snake's current path: moving RIGHT. Let's think about the possible future moves. The apple at (5,6) is in row 5, column 6. The head is at (5,2). If the snake continues moving RIGHT, in a few steps, it can reach (5,6). Let's see: from (5,2), moving RIGHT steps: (5,3) → (5,4) → (5,5) → (5,6). That's 4 steps. So if the snake continues RIGHT, in 4 moves, it will reach the apple at (5,6). But we need to make sure that the path is clear and there's no collision.\n\nWhat's the current body? The body is at (5,1). When the snake moves RIGHT, the body moves to (5,2), then next move, the body would be at (5,3), etc. So as the snake moves right, the body follows. Let's simulate a few steps:\n\nCurrent state (epoch 5):\nHead: (5,2), Body: (5,1), Direction: RIGHT.\n\nEpoch 6 (after moving RIGHT):\nHead: (5,3), Body: (5,2), Direction: RIGHT (if we keep direction).\n\nEpoch 7: move RIGHT again → Head (5,4), Body (5,3).\n\nEpoch 8: move RIGHT → Head (5,5), Body (5,4).\n\nEpoch 9: move RIGHT → Head (5,6). Oh! (5,6) is the apple (A). So at epoch 9, the head would reach (5,6), eat the apple, grow. So that's a good path.\n\nBut what if we change direction now? For example, if we go UP, then the snake's path might take it away from the apple. Let's see:\n\nIf we choose UP at epoch 5, direction becomes UP.\n\nEpoch 6: Head (4,2), Body (5,2).\n\nEpoch 7: possible directions (can't reverse UP to DOWN). So can go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. If we go UP again, head (3,2), Body (4,2).\n\nThat's moving up, which might not lead towards the apples. The apples are at (1,1), (2,6), (5,6). The (5,6) is the closest. So continuing RIGHT seems better.\n\nWhat about possible collisions? Let's check the walls. The snake is in row 5, column 2. Moving RIGHT: columns go up to 6 (since column 7 is a wall). So (5,6) is the apple, then (5,7) is a wall. So after eating (5,6), the next move RIGHT would hit the wall (column 7), which is bad. So after eating that apple, we need to turn. But that's future steps. For now, at epoch 5, the best move is to continue RIGHT to approach the apple at (5,6).\n\nAnother apple is at (2,6). That's in row 2, column 6. To reach there, the snake would have to move up from row 5 to row 2. But that's 3 rows up, and then right. But (5,6) is closer.\n\nSo the optimal direction now is to continue moving RIGHT, as it's the current direction (allowed) and leads towards the nearest apple.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#SH   A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5, 2) (row 5, column 2), and its body (S) is at (5, 1). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. The goal is to move toward apples while avoiding walls and self-collision. \n\nThe apples are located at (1, 1), (2, 6), and (5, 6). The closest apple is at (5, 6) in the same row (row 5) as the snake's head. Continuing to move RIGHT will guide the head toward this apple. \n\n- Moving RIGHT: The head will move to (5, 3), which is empty. This direction keeps the snake on a path toward the apple at (5, 6) without immediate risk of collision. \n- Alternatives (UP or DOWN) would move the snake away from the nearest apple, delaying apple consumption. \n\nThus, the best choice is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' walls. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A     # (so positions (1,1) is A, others are empty)\nRow 2: #     A# (positions (2,6) is A)\nRow 3: #      # (all empty)\nRow 4: #      # (all empty)\nRow 5: # SH  A# (Let's check positions here. The row is \"# SH  A#\", so indexes 1 to 6. Let's index from 1 (since row 0 is the top wall). So position (5,1) is '#', then (5,2) is ' ', (5,3) is 'S' (body), (5,4) is 'H' (head), (5,5) is ' ', (5,6) is 'A' (apple). Wait, let's check again. The row is \"# SH  A#\". So the characters are: index 0: '#', index 1: ' ', index 2: 'S', index 3: 'H', index 4: ' ', index 5: ' ', index 6: 'A', index 7: '#'. Oh right, because the row is 8 characters. So row 5 (since rows start at 0) is \"# SH  A#\", which breaks down as:\n\nRow 5:\n0: '#'\n1: ' ' (column 1)\n2: 'S' (column 2)\n3: 'H' (column 3)\n4: ' ' (column 4)\n5: ' ' (column 5)\n6: 'A' (column 6)\n7: '#'\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at position (5,3) (row 5, column 3). The body (S) is at (5,2). The current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is moving to the right (towards higher column numbers). \n\nThe snake's movement: when it moves, the head moves one square in the current direction, and if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (the last part of the body) is removed. If it eats an apple, the body grows (so the tail isn't removed, making the snake longer).\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction. So possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since reversing would be LEFT, which is opposite of RIGHT, so not allowed).\n\nLet's see where the head is moving if we keep the current direction (RIGHT). The head is at (5,3). Moving RIGHT would take it to (5,4). Let's check what's there. In row 5, column 4 is ' ' (empty). So if we move RIGHT, the new head position is (5,4). Then, since there's no apple there, the body would move: the previous head (5,3) becomes S, and the previous S (5,2) would be removed (since the snake didn't eat an apple). So the new body would be (5,3) as S, and head at (5,4). But is there any danger here? Let's check for collisions. The new head (5,4) is within the walls (columns 1-6, since walls are at 0 and 7). So no wall collision. Also, the body is at (5,3), which is the previous head, so no self-collision.\n\nBut maybe there's an apple nearby. Let's check the positions of apples. The apples are in row 1, column 1 (A), row 2, column 6 (A), and row 5, column 6 (A). The head is at (5,3). Let's see possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. Possible directions to turn are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (can't go LEFT). Let's evaluate each option:\n\nOption 1: Continue RIGHT. Next head position is (5,4). Empty. Safe. Then, next move could be towards (5,5), then (5,6) which has an apple. If we go RIGHT three times, we can reach the apple at (5,6). That's a good path.\n\nOption 2: Turn UP. Current head is (5,3). Moving UP would take it to (4,3). Let's check row 4: \"#      #\", which is all empty. So (4,3) is empty. Safe. Then, the body would move: previous head (5,3) becomes S, previous S (5,2) is removed. New body at (5,3). No collision. Then, next direction could be UP again, moving to (3,3), etc. But are there apples in that direction? The apples are at (1,1), (2,6), (5,6). So maybe not the closest.\n\nOption 3: Turn DOWN. Head (5,3) moving DOWN would go to (6,3). Row 6 is \"#      #\", so (6,3) is empty. Safe. Then body moves as before. Then, next move could be DOWN again to (7,3), but row 7 is the bottom wall (row 7 is \"########\"), so (7,3) is a wall. So moving DOWN once is safe, but moving again would hit the wall. So that's a risk.\n\nThe closest apple is at (5,6), which is to the RIGHT of the current head. The head is at (5,3), so moving RIGHT would get closer to (5,6). Let's calculate the steps:\n\nCurrent head (5,3). Direction RIGHT. Next positions:\n\nMove 1 (current epoch 6, next epoch 7): head (5,4) (empty). Body (5,3) becomes S, previous S (5,2) is removed.\n\nMove 2 (epoch 8): direction RIGHT again. Head (5,5) (empty). Body (5,4) becomes S, previous S (5,3) is removed.\n\nMove 3 (epoch 9): direction RIGHT. Head (5,6) (apple). Then, the snake eats the apple, grows. So the body would not lose the tail. So the body would be (5,5) (new S from previous head), (5,4) (previous S), and the head at (5,6). Score increases by 1. That's good.\n\nIf we turn RIGHT now (current direction is RIGHT, so we can keep moving RIGHT), we can reach the apple in 3 steps. So the best direction is to continue moving RIGHT. Because any other direction (UP or DOWN) would take us away from the nearest apple, and might lead to collisions or longer paths. So the optimal direction here is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n# SH  A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5,3) (row 5, column 3), with a body segment (S) at (5,2). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The goal is to move toward apples safely. \n\nApples are located at (1,1), (2,6), and (5,6). The closest apple to the head is at (5,6), which is to the right of the head. Continuing to move RIGHT will guide the head toward this apple. \n\n- Moving RIGHT next will take the head to (5,4) (empty, safe). \n- Subsequent RIGHT moves will lead to (5,5) (empty, safe) and then (5,6) (apple), where the snake will eat the apple, grow, and increase the score. \n\nOther directions (UP or DOWN) would move the head away from the nearest apple and offer no immediate advantage. Thus, the best choice is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A     # → So column 1 has an 'A' (apple) at position (1,1) [assuming rows are 0-7 from top to bottom, columns 0-7 left to right]\nRow 2: #     A# → An 'A' at (2,6)\nRow 3: #      # → empty\nRow 4: #      # → empty\nRow 5: #  SH A# → Let's check each column here. The row is \"#  SH A#\", so columns 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is 'S' (snake body), 4 is 'H' (head), 5 is ' ', 6 is 'A' (apple), 7 is '#'. So head is at (5,4), body at (5,3).\nRow 6: #      # → empty\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right. The snake's head is at (5,4). When moving RIGHT, the next position would be (5,5). Let's check what's there. In row 5, column 5 is ' ' (empty), according to the current board. So if the snake moves RIGHT, the head moves to (5,5). Then, since the snake is moving, the body would follow. Since the current length is 2 (H and S), the body (S) was at (5,3). When moving, the new body positions would be the previous positions of the head and the old body. Wait, the snake's movement: when moving, the head moves to the new direction, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So original positions are H at (5,4), S at (5,3). If moving RIGHT, the new head is (5,5). The body's new position is where the head was: (5,4). So the new positions would be H at (5,5), S at (5,4). Then, check if that new head position is a wall, body, or apple. (5,5) is empty, so no collision. So that's safe.\n\nBut maybe there's an apple nearby. Let's check the apples. The current apples are at (1,1), (2,6), (5,6). The head is at (5,4). If moving RIGHT to (5,5), that's not an apple. The next apple to the right of the head is at (5,6). So if the snake continues RIGHT, next move (epoch 8) would take it to (5,5), then if direction remains RIGHT, epoch 9 would be (5,6), which is an apple. Eating that would increase the score and the snake would grow. But wait, the current epoch is 7, so after this move, it's epoch 8. Let's see if moving RIGHT is possible, but are there other directions that might lead to apples faster or avoid danger?\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction. So the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT. Because reversing would be LEFT (since current is RIGHT, left is opposite, which is not allowed). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. RIGHT (current direction). Next head position (5,5). Check for collision: (5,5) is empty. The body was at (5,3), after moving, the body moves to (5,4). So the new positions are H at (5,5), S at (5,4). No collision with walls (since row 5 is between 0 and 7, column 5 is between 0 and 7, so within the board). So this is safe.\n\n2. UP: Moving up from (5,4) would take the head to (4,4). Let's check (4,4). The row 4 is \"#      #\", so (4,4) is empty. The body (5,3) would move to (5,4) (the previous head position). So new positions: H at (4,4), S at (5,4). Check if (4,4) is a wall? No. Check if (4,4) is body? The body is at (5,4), so (4,4) is safe. So moving UP is allowed. Are there any apples in that direction? Let's see, apples are at (1,1), (2,6), (5,6). (4,4) is empty, so no apple eaten here.\n\n3. DOWN: Moving down from (5,4) would take the head to (6,4). Row 6 is \"#      #\", so (6,4) is empty. The body (5,3) moves to (5,4). So new positions: H at (6,4), S at (5,4). Check collision: (6,4) is within the board (row 6 is valid). So safe. No apple here either.\n\nNow, which direction leads to an apple? The closest apple is at (5,6) (same row as the head, two steps to the right). If we continue moving RIGHT, next step (epoch 8) head is at (5,5), then in epoch 9, moving RIGHT again, head would be at (5,6), which is the apple. That would be good. So moving RIGHT now allows us to reach that apple in the next move.\n\nWhat if we turn UP or DOWN? Let's see. If we turn UP now (epoch 7), head goes to (4,4). Then in epoch 8, the direction could be adjusted. But the snake's direction can be changed each epoch, as long as it's not reversing. For example, after moving UP, the next direction could be RIGHT again (since UP to RIGHT is allowed, not reversing). But perhaps the optimal path is to go towards the apple in (5,6) by continuing RIGHT.\n\nAlso, need to check if any direction would cause collision. Let's confirm all possibilities:\n\n- RIGHT: (5,5) is safe. No walls, no body. So okay.\n- UP: (4,4) is safe.\n- DOWN: (6,4) is safe.\n\nSo all three directions are possible. But the best choice is to go towards the apple. The apple at (5,6) is in the same row as the head, so moving RIGHT will get us closer. So the best direction is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SH A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5,4) (row 5, column 4) and the body is at (5,3). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5,5). This position is empty (no walls or body), so it is safe. Continuing RIGHT in subsequent moves would allow the snake to reach the apple at (5,6) in the next step, which is the closest apple.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (4,4), which is empty but not near any apples.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (6,4), which is empty but also not near any apples.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to continue moving RIGHT to approach the nearby apple at (5,6). \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SHA#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT, and the current epoch is 8. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. Let's find the positions of H and S.\n\nLooking at the 5th row (since rows are 0-indexed from top, I think, but let's count properly. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (walls)\nRow 1: #A     # (so positions 1,1 is A, rest spaces)\nRow 2: #     A# (position 2,6 is A)\nRow 3: #      #\nRow 4: #      #\nRow 5: #   SHA# (so positions 5,3 is S, 5,4 is H, 5,5 is A)\nRow 6: #      #\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at row 5, column 4 (assuming columns are 0-based from left). The body (S) is at row 5, column 3. The current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is moving to the right (increasing column index). \n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is RIGHT, the snake can't turn LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (but moving in the same direction is allowed).\n\nNow, let's think about the next move. The snake moves one square in the direction chosen. Let's check where the head will go next based on each possible direction.\n\nCurrent head position: (5,4). Let's note the coordinates as (row, column).\n\nIf direction is RIGHT (current direction), next head position is (5,5). What's at (5,5)? Looking at row 5: #   SHA# → positions 5,5 is A (apple). So moving RIGHT would take the head to the apple. Eating the apple would make the snake grow. The snake's length is currently 2 (since there's S and H, so length 2). When it eats the apple, the length becomes 3. The new head is at (5,5), and the body parts would follow. The previous head (5,4) becomes part of the body, and the previous body (5,3) would stay as part of the body. So after moving RIGHT, the new positions would be: the new head is (5,5) (A is eaten), the body is (5,4) (H becomes S), and (5,3) (S remains). Also, a new apple would spawn, but the example shows that the existing apples not eaten stay. Let's check the example given. In the example, when moving DOWN, the apple was eaten, and the new board had the other apples still present. So in the current scenario, if we move RIGHT to (5,5) which is A, we eat that apple. Then, the new head is (5,5), the previous H (5,4) becomes S, and the previous S (5,3) remains as S. So the snake's body would be (5,3), (5,4), and head at (5,5). That's safe, no collision with walls or itself.\n\nWhat if we choose UP? Let's see. Current head is (5,4). Moving UP would take it to (4,4). Let's check (4,4): row 4 is #      #, so (4,4) is a space. So next head is (4,4). The body would follow. The previous H (5,4) becomes S, and the previous S (5,3) would move to where? Wait, the snake's movement: when the snake moves, each body part follows the previous one. So the head moves first, then each S takes the position of the previous S. So the current snake is [S at (5,3), H at (5,4)] (since S is the body, H is the head; the order is S (body) followed by H (head), so the snake's segments are (5,3) → (5,4)). When moving, the head moves to new position, then each body part moves to the position of the previous segment. So if the head moves to (4,4), the body (5,4) (previous head) becomes the new body part, and (5,3) (previous body) moves to (5,4) only if the snake's length increases. Wait, no. The snake's length increases when it eats an apple. Otherwise, the length remains the same. So when it doesn't eat an apple, the snake moves forward, and the tail (the last body part) is removed. Because the snake moves one square, and the length stays the same. Let me think. For example, a snake of length 2 (S and H) moving right. The head moves to new position, the body (S) moves to the previous head position, and the tail (if any) is removed. But in this case, the snake's length is 2 (S and H), so moving without eating an apple: the new head is new position, the body is the previous head position, and the tail (the original S) is removed? Wait, no. Let's take the example given in the problem statement. The initial example's board is:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So the head is at row 3 (assuming rows 0-7), column 1 (since the row is #H     #, so H is at (3,1)). The body is S at row 2, column 1 (row 2: #S     #). So the snake is S (2,1) → H (3,1). Direction is DOWN. So moving down: head moves to (4,1). Since (4,1) is A (apple), the snake eats it. So the length increases by 1. So the new snake would be S (2,1) → S (3,1) → H (4,1). So the body parts are the previous positions. So when the snake eats an apple, the tail (the last segment) is not removed. When it doesn't eat, the tail is removed, keeping the length the same.\n\nSo, in our current scenario, the snake's length is 2 (S and H). So, if the next move does not eat an apple, the snake moves: head goes to new position, body (S) moves to previous head position, and the tail (the original S) is removed? Wait, no. Let's think again. For a snake of length 2 (segments: S1, H), when moving, the new head is H_new. Then S1 moves to H's old position. So the new snake is S1 (old H position), H (new position). The length remains 2. Because the snake moves forward, and the tail (the original S1's position) is vacated. So, the snake's body is the previous positions of the head, up to length-1.\n\nIn the current problem, the snake's body is S at (5,3), and H at (5,4). So the snake's segments are [ (5,3), (5,4) ]. Length is 2.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT (current direction), the new head is (5,5). What's (5,5)? It's A. So eating the apple. Then, the snake's length increases by 1 (now 3). So the new segments are [ (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ]. Because when you eat an apple, you don't remove the tail. So the body parts are all previous positions. So S remains at (5,3), then (5,4) becomes S, and (5,5) is H. So in the new board, the positions would be S at (5,3), S at (5,4), H at (5,5). And the A at (5,5) is eaten, so that square becomes H, and another apple may spawn (but the problem statement says \"the next state of board will be\" as in the example, which shows that the other apples remain. The example's initial board has A's in (1,5), (4,1), (4,2). After moving down, the new board has A's at (1,3), (4,2), (4,1) → perhaps the eaten apple is replaced? The example's initial board after moving down has:\n\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nOriginal example's initial board had row 1: #     A# (so A at 1,5). Row 3: #H     # (H at 3,1). Row 4: #AA    # (A at 4,1 and 4,2). After moving down (direction DOWN), the head moves to 4,1 (which is A). So the new head is at 4,1 (H), the previous H (3,1) becomes S, and the previous S (2,1) becomes S. So the snake's segments are (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). So the row 4 now has HA (H at 4,1, A at 4,2). Row 3: #S     # (S at 3,1). Row 2: #S     # (S at 2,1). Row 1: #  A  A# (A's at 1,3 and 1,5 perhaps). So the A at (4,1) was eaten, and perhaps a new A is placed at (1,3). So the apples not eaten remain, and the eaten one is replaced. But the problem statement says \"the game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board\". So after eating an apple, a new one is added to keep the total apples at 3? The example initial board has 3 apples (row 1 A, row 4 two A's → 3 apples). After eating one, the new board has 3 apples again (row 1 two A's, row 4 one A). So yes, each time an apple is eaten, a new one is spawned. But for the current problem, perhaps the exact placement of new apples isn't critical for the immediate decision. \n\nBack to current problem. Let's check possible directions:\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (can't go LEFT, which is reverse).\n\nOption 1: RIGHT. New head position (5,5). What's there? The current row 5 is #   SHA# → positions 5,5 is A. So moving RIGHT would eat the apple. That's good. Then, the snake grows. The new head is (5,5), previous H (5,4) becomes S, previous S (5,3) remains S. So the new snake segments are (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). Are there any collisions? The new head is (5,5), which is within the board (columns 0-7, rows 0-7). The walls are the first and last rows and columns (0 and 7). So (5,5) is safe (row 5 is between 0 and 7, column 5 is between 0 and 7). No collision with walls. Also, the new head's position (5,5) is not part of the body (the body is at (5,3) and (5,4)), so no self-collision. So this move is safe and gains a point.\n\nOption 2: UP. New head position (4,4). Let's check (4,4). Row 4 is #      #, so (4,4) is empty. So the snake moves up. The new head is (4,4). The body segments would be (5,4) (previous H) and (5,3) (previous S). But since we didn't eat an apple, the length remains 2, so the tail (the previous S) is removed? Wait, no. The length is 2. So when moving, the snake's body is the previous positions. Let's clarify: the snake's movement when not eating an apple. For a snake of length L, each move, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. The tail (the last segment) is removed, so the length remains L. So in our case, current length is 2. The segments are [S (5,3), H (5,4)]. When moving UP, the head moves to (4,4). Then, the body (H's previous position, (5,4)) becomes the new S. The previous S (5,3) is the tail and is removed. So the new snake segments are [ (5,4), (4,4) ]. So the new positions are S at (5,4), H at (4,4). Let's check for collisions. The new head (4,4) is in row 4, column 4. Is that a wall? No, walls are rows 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7. So (4,4) is safe. The body is (5,4), which is not overlapping with the head, so no self-collision. So moving UP is safe but doesn't eat an apple.\n\nOption 3: DOWN. New head position (6,4). Let's check (6,4). Row 6 is #      #, so (6,4) is empty. So the snake moves down. The new head is (6,4). The body segments would be (5,4) (previous H) and (5,3) (previous S). But since no apple is eaten, the tail (5,3) is removed. So the new snake segments are [ (5,4), (6,4) ]. Check for collision: (6,4) is in row 6, column 4. Rows 0-7, columns 0-7. So (6,4) is within the board (not a wall). No collision with body (since body is (5,4), head is (6,4)). So moving DOWN is safe but no apple.\n\nOption 4: LEFT. But current direction is RIGHT. Reversing direction (LEFT) is not allowed. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo the best option is to move RIGHT, which allows the snake to eat the apple (A at (5,5)), increasing the score and growing the snake. This move is safe, as there's no collision with walls or the snake's own body.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SHA#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5,4) (row 5, column 4), with a body segment (S) at (5,3). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). \n\n### Analysis of possible moves:\n- **RIGHT (current direction)**: The head moves to (5,5), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. The new head position (5,5) is within the board (no wall collision) and does not overlap with the snake's body (current body segments are at (5,3) and (5,4)). This move is safe and beneficial.\n- **UP**: The head moves to (4,4), an empty space. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow. This move is safe but does not improve the score.\n- **DOWN**: The head moves to (6,4), an empty space. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow. This move is safe but does not improve the score.\n- **LEFT**: Reverses the current direction (RIGHT → LEFT), which is invalid per the rules.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and safely avoid collisions. This is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, let's start by understanding the current game board. Let's repeat the board as given:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   SSH#\n#      #\n########\n\nSo the board is 8x8. The snake's head is 'H' and the body is 'S'. Let's find the positions. Looking at the 5th row (since rows are 0-indexed from top, maybe?), let's check each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #A     # → positions (1,1) is A, others empty except walls.\nRow 2: #     A# → (2,6) is A.\nRow 3: #      # → empty.\nRow 4: # A    # → (4,2) is A.\nRow 5: #   SSH# → Let's break this down. The row is \"#   SSH#\". So positions (5,1) is ' ', (5,2) ' ', (5,3) 'S', (5,4) 'S', (5,5) 'H', (5,6) is '#'. So the head is at (5,5). The body is at (5,4) and (5,3). So the snake's current direction is RIGHT. Since the current direction is RIGHT, the snake is moving right. Let's confirm: the head is at (5,5). The body is to the left (since direction is RIGHT, the next move would be to the right of the head). So the previous positions would be: the head was at (5,5), the body at (5,4) and (5,3). So when moving RIGHT, the next head position would be (5,6). Wait, but (5,6) is a wall (since the row is \"#   SSH#\", so index 6 is the right wall). Oh right! Because each row starts and ends with '#', so for row 5, the columns are 0 to 7. Let's index rows from top (0) to bottom (7). So row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom. Each row has columns 0 (left wall) to 7 (right wall).\n\nSo let's map the coordinates properly. For row 5 (the 6th line in the input), the string is \"#   SSH#\". Let's index each character:\n\nColumn 0: '#' (left wall)\nColumn 1: ' ' (empty)\nColumn 2: ' ' (empty)\nColumn 3: 'S' (body)\nColumn 4: 'S' (body)\nColumn 5: 'H' (head)\nColumn 6: '#' (right wall)\nColumn 7: '#' (right wall? Wait, no. Wait, each row has 8 characters. Let me check the input again. The input's game board lines each have 8 characters. For example, the first line is \"########\" (8 #s). So each row is 8 columns (0-7).\n\nSo row 5 (0-based index 5) is \"#   SSH#\". Let's count the characters:\n\n0: '#'\n1: ' '\n2: ' '\n3: 'S'\n4: 'S'\n5: 'H'\n6: '#'\n7: '#'? No, that's 8 characters. Wait, let's list them:\n\nRow 5: \"#   SSH#\" → Let's count:\n\nCharacter 0: '#'\n\nCharacter 1: ' '\n\nCharacter 2: ' '\n\nCharacter 3: 'S'\n\nCharacter 4: 'S'\n\nCharacter 5: 'H'\n\nCharacter 6: '#'\n\nCharacter 7: '#'? Because 0-7 is 8 characters. So the head is at (row 5, column 5). The body is at (5,4) and (5,3). The current direction is RIGHT. So the next move would be to the right of the head. The head is at (5,5), moving RIGHT → next position would be (5,6). But (5,6) is a wall (since column 6 in row 5 is '#'). Oh, right! So moving RIGHT would cause a collision with the wall. That's bad, the game would end. So we can't choose RIGHT.\n\nThe snake cannot reverse direction. The current direction is RIGHT, so the opposite direction is LEFT. So the snake can't reverse to LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. But RIGHT is a wall. So the options are UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check possible moves:\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT. Possible next directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT. But RIGHT is a wall, so that's invalid. So we need to choose between UP and DOWN.\n\nFirst, let's check where the head is: (5,5). Let's see possible next positions:\n\nIf direction is UP: the head moves up to row 4, column 5. Let's check row 4. Row 4 is \"# A    #\". Let's map row 4 (row index 4):\n\nColumn 0: '#'\n\nColumn 1: ' '\n\nColumn 2: 'A' (apple)\n\nColumn 3: ' '\n\nColumn 4: ' '\n\nColumn 5: ' '\n\nColumn 6: '#'\n\nColumn 7: '#'\n\nSo (4,5) is ' ' (empty). So moving UP, the head would go to (4,5). Now, check if that position is a wall (no, it's empty) or a body part (the body is at (5,4) and (5,3), so (4,5) is not a body part). So moving UP is safe.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: the head moves down to row 6, column 5. Let's check row 6. Row 6 is \"#      #\". So columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: '#', 7: '#'. So (6,5) is ' ', which is empty. So moving DOWN is also safe.\n\nNow, check if there's an apple in any of the possible next positions.\n\nMoving UP: next position is (4,5). In row 4, column 5 is ' ' (no apple). So no apple eaten here.\n\nMoving DOWN: next position is (6,5). That's ' ', no apple.\n\nBut wait, let's check other apples. The current apples are in the board. Let's list all apples:\n\nRow 1, column 1: 'A' (row 1, col 1)\n\nRow 2, column 6: 'A' (row 2, col 6)\n\nRow 4, column 2: 'A' (row 4, col 2)\n\nSo those are the three apples. So moving UP or DOWN now doesn't get an apple. But perhaps we need to plan for the next steps. Let's think about the snake's body. The snake's current body is (5,4) and (5,3). The length is 3 (head + 2 body parts). So when moving, the tail (the last body part) would move if no apple is eaten. Because when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward (so the body follows the head, and the tail is removed). If it eats an apple, the tail stays, so the snake grows.\n\nBut in this case, the next move (UP or DOWN) doesn't hit an apple, so the tail (5,3) would be removed, and the body would shift. Let's see:\n\nCurrent snake positions (from head to tail):\n\nHead: (5,5)\n\nBody1: (5,4)\n\nBody2: (5,3)\n\nIf direction is UP, next head is (4,5). Then the new body positions would be (5,5) (old head) and (5,4) (old body1). The tail (5,3) is removed. So new body is (5,5) and (5,4). The new snake positions are (4,5) [head], (5,5) [body], (5,4) [body].\n\nIf direction is DOWN, next head is (6,5). Then body positions are (5,5) (old head) and (5,4) (old body1). Tail (5,3) removed. So new body is (5,5) and (5,4).\n\nNow, let's check if any of these directions lead to possible future apples. Let's think about the next moves.\n\nIf we go UP: head at (4,5). Next possible directions (since current direction would be UP). Then possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (can't reverse to DOWN). Let's see:\n\nFrom (4,5), moving UP again would go to (3,5). That's empty. Moving LEFT would be (4,4). Empty. Moving RIGHT would be (4,6). Let's check row 4, column 6: row 4 is \"# A    #\", column 6 is '#', which is a wall. So moving RIGHT from (4,5) (after moving UP) would hit a wall. So that's bad.\n\nIf we go DOWN: head at (6,5). Next direction would be DOWN. Possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (can't reverse to UP). Let's check (6,5) moving DOWN would go to (7,5). Row 7 is \"########\", so (7,5) is a wall. So that's bad. Moving LEFT from (6,5) would be (6,4). Empty. Moving RIGHT would be (6,6). Row 6, column 6 is '#', wall. So moving RIGHT is bad.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the closest apple. The apples are at (1,1), (2,6), (4,2). Let's calculate the distance from the head (5,5) to each apple.\n\nApple at (1,1): distance is (5-1) rows up, (5-1) columns left → 4 + 4 = 8 steps.\n\nApple at (2,6): (5-2)=3 rows up, (6-5)=1 column right → 3 + 1=4 steps.\n\nApple at (4,2): (5-4)=1 row up, (5-2)=3 columns left → 1 +3=4 steps.\n\nSo the closest apples are (2,6) and (4,2), each 4 steps away.\n\nLet's think about how to reach (4,2). The head is at (5,5). To reach (4,2), the snake would need to move up (to (4,5)), then left (to (4,4)), then left (to (4,3)), then left (to (4,2)). That's 4 steps. But the snake's current direction is RIGHT, so first move must be UP or DOWN (since RIGHT is a wall). Let's say we choose UP. Then the next direction could be LEFT (since after moving UP, the current direction is UP, and the next direction can be LEFT (allowed, since it's not the reverse of UP (which is DOWN)). So moving UP, then LEFT, then LEFT, then LEFT. Let's check if those paths are clear.\n\nFirst move: UP → (4,5). Safe.\n\nSecond move: LEFT → (4,4). Is (4,4) empty? Yes (row 4 is \"# A    #\", columns 0-7: 0='#',1=' ',2='A',3=' ',4=' ',5=' ',6='#',7='#'. So (4,4) is ' '). So moving LEFT from (4,5) to (4,4) is safe.\n\nThird move: LEFT → (4,3). Also ' '.\n\nFourth move: LEFT → (4,2). That's the apple! So that's a possible path.\n\nBut if we move DOWN first, let's see. Moving DOWN takes us to (6,5). Then, to reach (4,2), we need to move up, but the direction after moving DOWN would be DOWN, so next direction can't be UP (reverse). So we can't reverse. So moving DOWN first would require more steps, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,6). The head is at (5,5). To reach (2,6), need to move up (5→4→3→2 rows), and right (5→6). Let's see.\n\nFirst, current direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT. So first move must be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (but RIGHT is wall). So first move is UP. Then, after moving UP to (4,5), the direction is UP. Then, can we turn RIGHT? Because direction is UP, turning RIGHT is allowed (not reverse). So moving UP to (4,5), then RIGHT to (4,6). But (4,6) is a wall (row 4, column 6 is '#'). So that's bad. So that path is blocked.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,5), moving UP to (4,5), then UP again to (3,5), then UP to (2,5). Then RIGHT to (2,6). Let's check (2,6) is the apple. So (2,6) is 'A' (row 2: \"#     A#\" → column 6 is 'A'). So (2,5) is (row 2, column 5) → row 2 is \"#     A#\", columns 0-7: 0='#',1=' ',2=' ',3=' ',4=' ',5=' ',6='A',7='#'. So (2,5) is ' ', (2,6) is 'A'. So path:\n\nMove UP (5→4), UP (4→3), UP (3→2), then RIGHT (2,5→2,6). That's 4 steps. Let's check if those steps are possible.\n\nFirst move: UP → (4,5) (safe).\n\nSecond move: UP → (3,5) (row 3 is \"#      #\", (3,5) is ' ' → safe).\n\nThird move: UP → (2,5) (row 2, (2,5) is ' ' → safe).\n\nFourth move: RIGHT → (2,6) (apple, which is good). So that's another path.\n\nSo both apples (4,2) and (2,6) are reachable in 4 steps. Which path is better?\n\nBut first, we need to choose the next direction. The current direction is RIGHT, and we can't go LEFT (reverse). So possible next directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. But RIGHT is a wall, so options are UP or DOWN.\n\nIf we choose UP, the snake moves to (4,5). That's safe, and allows us to proceed towards either apple. If we choose DOWN, the snake moves to (6,5). Let's see what's around (6,5). The row 6 is \"#      #\", so (6,5) is empty. Then, moving down again would hit row 7, which is a wall. So moving DOWN may not be as good as UP, since moving UP allows the snake to approach the apples in the upper part of the board.\n\nSo the best choice is to move UP. Because moving UP allows the snake to start moving towards the apples, whereas moving DOWN might lead into a dead end (since the bottom is a wall). Therefore, the next direction should be UP.\n\n\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   SSH#\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position & Direction**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 5, column 5). The body ('S') is at (5,4) and (5,3). The current direction is RIGHT.\n\n2. **Collision Checks**:\n   - **RIGHT**: The head would move to (5,6), which is a wall (row 5 ends with '#'). This causes a collision, so RIGHT is invalid.\n   - **LEFT**: Reversing direction (current direction is RIGHT) is not allowed. LEFT is invalid.\n   - **UP**: The head moves to (4,5). Row 4, column 5 is empty (no wall or body collision). Safe.\n   - **DOWN**: The head moves to (6,5). Row 6, column 5 is empty (no wall or body collision). Safe.\n\n3. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,1), (2,6), and (4,2). The closest apples are (2,6) and (4,2), each 4 steps from the head.\n\n4. **Path Analysis**:\n   - **UP** allows the snake to move toward the upper half of the board, where apples are located. From (4,5), the snake can later turn LEFT to reach (4,2) or continue UP to reach (2,6).\n   - **DOWN** moves the snake toward the bottom wall (row 7), limiting future movement options and making it harder to reach apples.\n\nThus, the safest and most strategic direction is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). Let's list out each row to get the positions:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #A     # → positions 1,1 is 'A'; others are empty except walls at 0 and 7.\nRow 2: #     A# → position 2,6 is 'A'\nRow 3: #      # → all empty except walls.\nRow 4: # A   H# → position 4,2 is 'A'; position 4,6 is 'H' (snake head)\nRow 5: #    SS# → positions 5,4 and 5,5 are 'S' (snake body)\nRow 6: #      # → empty except walls.\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. Let's confirm the snake's body positions. The head is at (4,6) (row 4, column 6, assuming rows are 0-7 top to bottom). The body is in row 5, columns 4 and 5. Since the current direction is UP, the next move would be towards row 3 (since UP means moving to a lower row number, assuming row 0 is top).\n\nWait, in grid terms, usually, moving UP would decrease the row index. So if the head is at row 4, column 6, moving UP would take it to row 3, column 6. Let's check that position. Row 3 is \"#      #\", so column 6 is empty (since row 3, column 0 is '#', column 7 is '#', so columns 1-6 are empty). So row 3, column 6 is empty. That's a valid move. But wait, we need to check if there's a body part there. The body is in row 5, columns 4 and 5. So row 3, column 6 is empty. So moving UP would take the head to (3,6). \n\nBut wait, the snake's body positions. The current body is at (5,4) and (5,5). The head is at (4,6). The snake's length is 1 (head) plus 2 body parts, so total length 3. So the snake's body is behind the head. Since the direction is UP, the previous movement was from row 5 to row 4 (since moving up). Let's reconstruct the snake's path. Let's think: the head is at (4,6). The body is in row 5. So the body segments are (5,5) and (5,4). That suggests that the snake was moving up, so the head moved from (5,6) to (4,6) in the previous step. Then the next body segment would be (5,6) (now part of the body, but in the current board, row 5, column 6 is '#'? Wait, row 5 is \"#    SS#\", so columns 0 is '#', columns 1-3 are empty, columns 4 and 5 are 'S', column 6 is '#'. Oh, row 5's structure is: index 0 is '#', 1-3 are ' ', 4 is 'S', 5 is 'S', 6 is '#', 7 is '#'? Wait, let's parse each row properly.\n\nLet's index each row from 0 (top) to 7 (bottom). Each row has 8 characters (columns 0 to 7).\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7: all '#')\nRow 1: #A     # → columns 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2-6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 2: #     A# → columns 0: '#', 1-5: ' ', 6: 'A', 7: '#'\nRow 3: #      # → columns 0: '#', 1-6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 4: # A   H# → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: 'H', 7: '#'\nRow 5: #    SS# → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: '#', 7: '#'\nRow 6: #      # → columns 0: '#', 1-6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 7: ######## (columns 0-7: '#')\n\nSo the head 'H' is at row 4, column 6 (row 4, column 6). The body 'S's are at row 5, column 4 and row 5, column 5. \n\nCurrent direction is UP. So the next move direction can't be DOWN (since you can't reverse direction). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since current direction is UP, reverse is DOWN, so allowed directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\nWe need to choose a direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN) but DOWN is invalid (reverse of UP). So possible options are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's analyze each possible direction:\n\n1. Moving UP (current direction): The head would move to row 3, column 6. Let's check that cell. Row 3, column 6 is ' ' (empty). So that's a valid move. The new head position is (3,6). Then, since the snake moves, the body will follow. The previous head position (4,6) becomes part of the body, and the last body segment (row 5, column 4) would be removed if no apple is eaten. But wait, in the current board, is there an apple at (3,6)? Let's check. Row 3, column 6 is ' ' (no apple). So no apple eaten. So the snake's length remains the same. The new body would be (4,6) (old head), (5,5), (5,4). So the new board would have H at (3,6), S at (4,6), (5,5), (5,4). But wait, the current body is two 'S's. The snake's length is 1 (head) + 2 (body) = 3. When moving without eating, the snake moves forward, so the head moves, and each body segment follows the previous one, so the tail (last S) is removed. So the new body after moving would be (4,6) (old head) and (5,5) (old body), since the tail (5,4) is removed. So the new body is two 'S's again. \n\n2. Moving LEFT: Direction LEFT. The snake is currently moving UP. Can it turn LEFT? Yes, because LEFT is not the reverse (reverse of UP is DOWN). So direction LEFT is allowed. Moving LEFT would mean the head moves from (4,6) to (4,5). Let's check (4,5). In row 4, column 5 is ' ' (since row 4 is \"# A   H#\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: 'H', 7: '#'). So column 5 in row 4 is ' '. So (4,5) is empty. Is there a body part there? The current body is (5,4) and (5,5). So (4,5) is empty. So moving LEFT is possible. After moving LEFT, the head is at (4,5). Check if that's an apple. No, (4,5) is ' ', so no apple. The body would then be (4,6) (old head), (5,5), (5,4) → but since no apple eaten, the tail (5,4) is removed, so new body is (4,6) and (5,5). \n\n3. Moving RIGHT: Direction RIGHT. The head is at (4,6). Moving RIGHT would take it to (4,7). But (4,7) is a wall ('#'), so that's a collision. So moving RIGHT is invalid (game over). So RIGHT is not allowed.\n\n4. Moving DOWN: Reverse of UP, which is not allowed. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, LEFT. Now, which is better? Let's look for apples. The current apples are at (1,1), (2,6), (4,2). \n\nCurrent head is at (4,6). Let's see where apples are:\n\n- (1,1) is top-left area.\n- (2,6) is row 2, column 6. That's in row 2, column 6. If the snake moves UP, next head position is (3,6). Then moving UP again would go to (2,6), which is an apple. So moving UP now could lead to eating that apple next step. Let's check:\n\nIf current move is UP → head at (3,6). Next direction could still be UP (since current direction would be UP), so next move to (2,6), which has an 'A'. Eating that apple would increase the score, and the snake would grow. So that's a good path.\n\nIf we move LEFT now, the head is at (4,5). Then, what's next? The direction could be LEFT again (moving to (4,4)), but (4,4) is empty. Or maybe other directions. Let's see. The apple at (4,2) is in row 4, column 2. So (4,5) → (4,4) → (4,3) → (4,2) would reach that apple. But that's three steps. But moving UP first to (3,6) then (2,6) (apple) is better, as that's two steps (current epoch 10, so 100 epochs left, but better to eat apples quickly).\n\nAnother apple is (1,1). That's in row 1, column 1. To reach there, the snake would need to move up a lot. But (2,6) is closer. So moving UP towards (2,6) seems better.\n\nAlso, check for possible collisions. If moving UP, (3,6) is safe. Then next step to (2,6) (apple) is safe. So that's a valid path.\n\nMoving LEFT would take the head to (4,5). Let's check if that's near any body parts. The current body is (5,4) and (5,5). So (4,5) is adjacent to (5,5) (the body part in row 5, column 5). But (4,5) is above (5,5), which is okay as long as it's not the same cell. Since (4,5) is empty, it's safe.\n\nSo the best option is to continue moving UP towards the apple at (2,6). So the direction should be UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# A   H#\n#    SS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake's head is at row 4, column 6. The body segments are at row 5, columns 4 and 5. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to row 4, column 7, which is a wall (collision). Invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to row 4, column 5 (empty, no collision). This is valid but does not lead directly to an apple.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to row 3, column 6 (empty, no collision). This direction positions the snake to reach the apple at row 2, column 6 in the next move (since continuing UP from row 3, column 6 would reach row 2, column 6, which has an apple).  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move UP to approach the nearest apple at row 2, column 6. \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8 with walls as '#'. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #A     # (so column 1 is 'A', others are empty except the walls at 0 and 7)\nRow 2: #     A# (column 6 is 'A')\nRow 3: #     H# (column 6 is 'H'—the head of the snake)\nRow 4: # A   S# (column 2 is 'A', column 5 is 'S'—body segment)\nRow 5: #     S# (column 5 is 'S'—another body segment)\nRow 6: #      # (empty except walls)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. Let's find the head's position. The head 'H' is in row 3, column 6 (since rows are 0-7, and row 3 is the fourth line). Let's confirm: row 3 is \"#     H#\", so positions 0 is '#', 1-5 are spaces, 6 is 'H', 7 is '#'. So H is at (3,6).\n\nCurrent direction is UP, so the next move (if direction remains UP) would take the head to row 2, column 6. Let's check what's there. Row 2 is \"#     A#\", so column 6 is 'A' (since row 2 has 'A' in column 6). So if the snake moves UP, it would go to (2,6), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple would increase the score and the snake grows. But wait, we need to check if moving UP is possible. The snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is UP, so possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (since reversing would be DOWN, which is not allowed). So allowed directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So, if current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's check the next positions for each possible direction.\n\nFirst, current direction is UP. Let's check the next position if direction is UP: (3-1,6) = (2,6). What's there? Row 2, column 6 is 'A' (since row 2 is \"#     A#\", so column 6 is A). So moving UP would eat the apple. That's good. Also, we need to check if that position is a wall or body. The walls are at the edges. (2,6) is within the board (rows 0-7, columns 0-7, so 2 is between 1 and 6, 6 is within 1-6). So not a wall. The body segments are at row 4, column 5 (S) and row 5, column 5 (S). So (2,6) is not a body. So moving UP would be safe, and eat an apple. That's a good move.\n\nWhat if we choose LEFT? The direction would be LEFT. The head is at (3,6). Moving LEFT would take it to (3,5). Let's check (3,5). Row 3 is \"#     H#\", which is positions 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: H, 7: #. So (3,5) is empty. So moving LEFT would be to (3,5). Then, the snake's body would follow. But since the current direction was UP, changing to LEFT is allowed (not reversing). But is (3,5) a safe position? Let's check for body. The body is at (4,5) and (5,5). So (3,5) is not a body. So that's safe, but no apple there. So score doesn't increase.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: The head is at (3,6). Moving RIGHT would take it to (3,7), which is a wall (since row 3 ends with #). So that's a collision. So moving RIGHT is invalid; the game would end. So RIGHT is not allowed.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: That's reversing (current direction is UP, so DOWN is reverse). So direction can't be DOWN. So that's invalid.\n\nSo the possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. But RIGHT is a wall, so invalid. So options are UP or LEFT.\n\nMoving UP: next position (2,6) is an apple. Safe, and gains a point. That's the best option.\n\nSo the answer should be UP.\n\n\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#     H#\n# A   S#\n#     S#\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 3, column 6).\n2. **Current Direction**: UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid).\n3. **Possible Directions**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is reversed and invalid).\n\n### Evaluation of Each Direction:\n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (row 2, column 6). Checking row 2: \"#     A#\" confirms column 6 is an apple ('A'). This position is safe (not a wall or snake body). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 3, column 5). This position is empty (no apple, no collision), but does not improve the score.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (row 3, column 7), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision and ends the game.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is the safest and most beneficial direction, as it allows the snake to eat an apple and avoid collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's list out each row to visualize it better:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A     # (so positions (1,1) is A, others in row 1 are empty except the walls)\nRow 2: #     H# (so the head H is at (2,6) since rows are 0-7, columns 0-7. Let's confirm: row 2, column 6 is H. Because the row is \"#     H#\", which is 8 characters. The positions are 0 to 7. So index 0 is '#', then 1-5 are spaces, 6 is H, 7 is '#'. So H is at (2,6).\nRow 3: #     S# (S at (3,6))\nRow 4: # A   S# (A at (4,2), S at (4,6))\nRow 5: #     S# (S at (5,6))\nRow 6: #   A  # (A at (6,3))\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. Let's track the snake's body. The head is H at (2,6). The body S's are in the rows below. Let's see:\n\n- H is at (2,6) (row 2, column 6)\n- Next S is row 3, column 6 → (3,6)\n- Then row 4, column 6 → (4,6)\n- Then row 5, column 6 → (5,6)\nSo the snake's body is a vertical line going down from (2,6) to (5,6). So the snake's length is 4 (H + 3 S's). Because the snake starts with length 1, each apple eaten increases length by 1, so 3 apples eaten (since 1+3=4).\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP. The next move would be to (2-1,6) → (1,6), because moving up decreases the row index. Let's check that position.\n\nRow 1 is \"#A     #\". Column 6 in row 1: let's count the characters. Row 1: positions 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (1,6) is a space. So if the snake moves UP (current direction), the new head position would be (1,6). Let's check if that's safe.\n\nIs (1,6) a wall? No, walls are at columns 0 and 7, rows 0 and 7. So (1,6) is within the board. Is (1,6) part of the snake's body? The current body is at (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). (1,6) is not part of the body, so no collision. So moving UP is possible.\n\nBut maybe there's a better direction. Let's consider possible directions. The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is UP, so reversing would be DOWN. So the possible directions the player can choose are UP (current direction, allowed), LEFT, RIGHT (since turning from UP to LEFT or RIGHT is allowed; reversing is only if the new direction is opposite). So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. UP: Next head position (1,6). What's there? It's a space (no apple). So the snake moves up, the tail (current last S) would move. Since it's not eating an apple, the length remains the same. The body would shift: new head at (1,6), then (2,6) becomes S, (3,6) becomes S, (4,6) becomes S, (5,6) is removed (since length is 4, so after moving, the new body is (1,6) [H], (2,6) [S], (3,6) [S], (4,6) [S]. So (5,6) is no longer part of the snake. That's safe.\n\n2. LEFT: Direction is LEFT. So the head moves to (2,6-1) = (2,5). Check (2,5): row 2 is \"#     H#\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: 'H', 7: '#'. So (2,5) is a space. Safe? Check if (2,5) is part of the body. The body is (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). (2,5) is not, so safe. So moving LEFT would take the head to (2,5). Then the body shifts. No apple here, so length remains.\n\n3. RIGHT: Direction is RIGHT. The head would move to (2,6+1) = (2,7). (2,7) is a wall (since column 7 is the right wall). So that's a collision. The game would end. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo RIGHT is not allowed (hits the wall). So possible directions are UP and LEFT.\n\nNow, let's check if there are apples nearby. The apples are at (1,1), (4,2), (6,3). Let's see:\n\nCurrent head is at (2,6). Let's see where the apples are. (1,1) is top-left, (4,2) is middle-left, (6,3) is lower-middle.\n\nIf moving UP to (1,6), the next position is (1,6). Are there any apples there? No. The next possible moves after that would depend on where the snake is. But maybe moving LEFT could get closer to an apple. Let's see:\n\nIf we move LEFT to (2,5). Then next possible directions. Let's think about the path. The snake's body is in column 6, rows 2-5. So moving LEFT would take the head to (2,5). Then, perhaps next move could be LEFT again to (2,4), then (2,3), etc. Let's see if there's a path to an apple.\n\nThe apple at (4,2) is in row 4, column 2. To reach that, the snake would need to move left from (2,6) to (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), then down maybe. But that's a bit far. The apple at (6,3) is in row 6, column 3. To reach that, the snake could go down (but current direction is UP, so after moving LEFT, the next direction could be DOWN if possible. But the snake can't reverse direction. So if the current direction after moving LEFT is LEFT, then the next direction can't be RIGHT (reverse). Let's think step by step.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (1,6) would take the head to row 1. The apple at (1,1) is in row 1, column 1. So from (1,6), moving LEFT each step: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). That's an apple. So moving UP first, then LEFT would reach that apple. Let's check if that path is possible.\n\nCurrent direction after moving UP would still be UP (since the player's input is the direction; if the player chooses UP, then the next direction is UP. So when the snake moves UP, the direction remains UP unless the player changes it. Wait, the problem says the player controls the direction by providing inputs. So each move, the player chooses the direction (which can't be the reverse of current direction). So the current direction is UP. The player can choose to continue moving UP, or turn LEFT or RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse, which is not allowed).\n\nIf the player chooses UP, the next head is (1,6), direction remains UP (if the player again chooses UP next time, but the player can change direction as long as it's not reverse). But for this move, the direction input is what the player gives. So the next direction after this move would be whatever the player inputs now.\n\nSo, in this case, the possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. But RIGHT is invalid (wall). So options are UP and LEFT.\n\nIf we choose UP, the next head is (1,6). Is that safe? Yes. Then, the next move could be LEFT (since current direction would be UP, so next direction can be LEFT, which is allowed). Then the head moves to (1,5), then (1,4), etc., towards (1,1) which is an apple. That's a good path.\n\nIf we choose LEFT, the head moves to (2,5). Then, the next possible direction could be UP (since current direction would be LEFT, so reverse is RIGHT, so allowed directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN). So moving UP from (2,5) would take the head to (1,5). Then, moving LEFT to (1,4), etc. Also possible.\n\nBut which direction is better? Let's check if there's any immediate danger. The snake's body is at (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). So if the snake moves UP, the new body positions would be (2,6) (new S), (3,6) (S), (4,6) (S), and (5,6) is no longer part of the snake (since the length is 4). So after moving UP, the snake's body is (1,6) [H], (2,6) [S], (3,6) [S], (4,6) [S]. That's safe.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT, the new head is (2,5). The body would shift: (2,6) becomes S, (3,6) becomes S, (4,6) becomes S, (5,6) is removed. So the new body is (2,5) [H], (2,6) [S], (3,6) [S], (4,6) [S]. That's also safe.\n\nNow, let's check if any of the possible moves would lead to an apple in the next step.\n\nIf moving UP to (1,6), that's a space. No apple. So the snake doesn't eat anything, length remains 4.\n\nIf moving LEFT to (2,5), that's a space. No apple. So same.\n\nSo neither direction leads to an apple in the immediate next step. Then, perhaps we need to choose a direction that allows the snake to reach an apple in the following steps without colliding.\n\nThe apples are at (1,1), (4,2), (6,3). Let's see which is closest.\n\nThe head is at (2,6). The distance to (1,1) is (2-1) rows up and (6-1) columns left → 1 + 5 = 6 steps.\n\nDistance to (4,2): (4-2) rows down, (6-2) columns left → 2 +4=6 steps.\n\nDistance to (6,3): (6-2) rows down, (6-3) columns left → 4 +3=7 steps. So (1,1) and (4,2) are 6 steps away.\n\nIf we move UP, then next step could be moving LEFT towards (1,1). That path is possible as there are no obstacles (since the snake's body is in column 6, rows 2-4, so the left side (columns 0-5) in rows 1-2 is empty). So moving UP then LEFT would be a clear path.\n\nIf we move LEFT, then the head is at (2,5). Then, moving UP to (1,5), then LEFT to (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). That's also a path to (1,1). Alternatively, moving DOWN from (2,5) to (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) which is the apple at (4,2). That's another path.\n\nSo both directions could lead to apples, but which is safer? Let's check possible collisions.\n\nIf moving UP, the next position is (1,6). The snake's body is now (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So if the snake continues moving LEFT, it's moving into empty space. No collision.\n\nIf moving LEFT to (2,5), the body is (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So moving further LEFT to (2,4), (2,3), etc. would also be safe.\n\nBut perhaps the best choice is to move UP, since the current direction is UP, and moving in the same direction is straightforward. Also, moving UP doesn't bring the snake closer to the body. Let's confirm that.\n\nCurrent body is (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). When moving UP to (1,6), the new body positions are (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So (2,6) is now part of the body, but (1,6) is the new head, which is not part of the body. So no collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (2,5): the new body is (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). The head is (2,5), which is adjacent to (2,6) (the first body part), but not overlapping, so safe.\n\nSince both directions are safe, but the problem requires choosing one. Let's see if there's any other factor. The problem states that the game ends after the 100th epoch, but current epoch is 12, so there's plenty of time. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible.\n\nIn the example given, when the snake moves into an apple, it grows. So the priority is to reach apples. Let's see which direction leads to an apple sooner.\n\nIf we move UP, then the next possible moves towards (1,1) would be LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT (from (1,6) to (1,1) is 5 steps left). So 5 moves.\n\nIf we move LEFT, then from (2,5), moving UP to (1,5), then LEFT 4 times to (1,1) (steps: (1,5) → (1,4) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1): 4 moves. So total steps from current position: 1 (LEFT) + 1 (UP) +4 (LEFT) = 6 steps. Whereas moving UP first, then 5 LEFT steps: 1 (UP) +5 (LEFT) = 6 steps. Same number.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT then DOWN towards (4,2). From (2,5), moving DOWN to (3,5), (4,5), then LEFT to (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). That's 3 steps (DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT). Let's count: (2,5) → (3,5) (DOWN) → (4,5) (DOWN) → (4,4) (LEFT) → (4,3) (LEFT) → (4,2) (LEFT). That's 5 steps from (2,5). So total steps from current position: 1 (LEFT) +5 steps = 6 steps. Same as before.\n\nSo both paths take similar steps. Since both directions are safe, perhaps the best choice is to continue moving UP, as reversing direction isn't needed and it's the current direction. Alternatively, maybe moving LEFT could avoid potential future collisions, but in this case, there's no immediate threat.\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any positions that the snake could collide with if it moves in a certain direction. For example, moving UP to (1,6) is safe. Moving LEFT to (2,5) is also safe.\n\nSo, considering all, either direction is possible. But the problem might expect the answer that avoids walls and self-collision, and since RIGHT is invalid, the options are UP and LEFT. Since the current direction is UP, and moving UP is allowed, and there's no danger, perhaps UP is the answer.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     H#\n#     S#\n# A   S#\n#     S#\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (2, 6) (row 2, column 6), moving in the UP direction. The snake's body (S) is vertically aligned below the head at (3, 6), (4, 6), and (5, 6), giving it a length of 4. The apples (A) are located at (1, 1), (4, 2), and (6, 3).\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would shift the head to (1, 6). This position is within the board (not a wall) and does not collide with the snake's body (which occupies (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)). The move is safe.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would shift the head to (2, 5). This position is within the board and does not collide with the snake's body. The move is safe.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would shift the head to (2, 7), which is a wall (column 7 is the right edge). This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n4. **DOWN**: Reversing direction (current direction is UP) is not allowed. **Invalid**.\n\n### Decision:\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe. Since the snake is already moving UP and no immediate threat exists, continuing in the current direction (UP) avoids unnecessary turns and maintains a straightforward path toward potential apples (e.g., the apple at (1, 1) in row 1).\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' as walls. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A    H# (so positions 1,1 is A; 1,5 is H (head))\nRow 2: #     S# (position 2,5 is S)\nRow 3: #     S# (position 3,5 is S)\nRow 4: # A   S# (position 4,2 is A; 4,5 is S)\nRow 5: #      # (no characters except walls)\nRow 6: #   A  # (position 6,3 is A)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head is at (1,5) (since row 1, column 5). The body segments are at (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So the snake's body is a vertical line going down from the head. Because the current direction is UP, the snake is moving upward. Let's confirm the movement: if the snake moves UP, the next position of the head would be (0,5). But row 0 is the top wall (all '#'), so moving UP would cause a collision with the wall. That's bad because the game ends if it hits the wall. So we can't go UP.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is UP, reversing would be DOWN. But can we turn to LEFT or RIGHT? Let's check the possible directions. The allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, but can't reverse. So from UP, reversing is DOWN, which is not allowed. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP. But UP is a wall, so UP is invalid. So options are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's check where the head would move if we choose LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nCurrent head position is (1,5) (row 1, column 5, assuming columns are 0-based). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 1: indexes 0-7. The row is \"#A    H#\". So positions:\n0: #\n1: A\n2: (space)\n3: (space)\n4: (space)\n5: H\n6: (space)\n7: #\n\nSo head is at (row=1, column=5). Let's use (row, column) coordinates where row 0 is top, column 0 is left.\n\nCurrent direction is UP, so moving UP would take head to (0,5). But row 0 is all '#', so that's a wall collision. So UP is invalid.\n\nPossible directions to turn: LEFT (column decreases by 1) or RIGHT (column increases by 1), or DOWN (but that's reverse, which is not allowed). Because the current direction is UP, the previous direction was UP (since it's moving in that direction), so the snake can't reverse to DOWN. So the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. But UP is invalid, so only LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check LEFT first. If direction is LEFT, the head moves to (1,4). What's at (1,4)? Let's check row 1: \"#A    H#\" — columns 0 to 7. Column 4 is a space (since H is at 5). So (1,4) is empty. Is that part of the snake's body? The body is at (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So (1,4) is safe.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT, the head moves to (1,6). Let's check row 1, column 6: the row is \"#A    H#\", so column 6 is a space (since H is at 5, column 6 is next, and the end is column 7 which is #). So (1,6) is empty. Also safe.\n\nNow, check if there's an apple in either direction. Let's look for apples. The apples are at:\n\nRow 1, column 1: A (from row 1: #A    H# → column 1 is A)\nRow 4, column 2: A (row 4: # A   S# → column 2 is A)\nRow 6, column 3: A (row 6: #   A  # → column 3 is A)\n\nSo moving LEFT (to 1,4) — is there an apple there? No. Moving RIGHT (to 1,6) — no apple there. So neither direction immediately leads to an apple. But we need to think about the snake's body and future moves. Let's think about the snake's body positions. The body is (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So the snake is currently in a vertical line going down from the head. The length of the snake is 4 (head + 3 body segments). When the snake moves, the body follows. So if the head moves LEFT to (1,4), the next body segments will be (1,5) (old head), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So the new body positions would be (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). Are any of these positions overlapping with the new head? No, because the head is at (1,4).\n\nIf the head moves RIGHT to (1,6), the body becomes (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). The new head is (1,6), which is safe.\n\nNow, check if moving LEFT or RIGHT would lead to possible collisions in the next steps. Let's see the current positions. Let's list all snake positions:\n\nHead: (1,5)\nBody 1: (2,5)\nBody 2: (3,5)\nBody 3: (4,5)\n\nIf direction is LEFT, next head position is (1,4). Then, the body will shift: each body part takes the position of the previous one. So new body positions are (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So the snake's new positions are (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). That's a horizontal move left, then the body follows. All positions are safe (no walls, no self-collision).\n\nIf direction is RIGHT, next head is (1,6). New body positions: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So snake positions are (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). Also safe.\n\nNow, which direction is better? Let's check the positions of the apples. The apples are at (1,1), (4,2), (6,3). Let's think about the snake's path. The current head is at (1,5). If we go LEFT, the head is at (1,4). Then possible next moves. If the snake continues moving LEFT, next head would be (1,3). Then (1,2), which is (1,2) — in row 1, column 2 is a space. Then (1,1), which is an apple! Oh, right! The apple is at (1,1). So moving LEFT would allow the snake to approach that apple. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head (1,5) → move LEFT to (1,4) (epoch 13). Then, next epoch (14), if direction remains LEFT (since you can keep moving in the same direction unless you turn), head moves to (1,3). Then epoch 15, LEFT to (1,2). Epoch 16, LEFT to (1,1) — which is the apple. So that's a good path. Eating that apple would increase the score and the snake would grow.\n\nIf we go RIGHT, the head moves to (1,6). Then next moves could be RIGHT again, but (1,7) is a wall (column 7 is #). So moving RIGHT again would hit the wall. So after moving RIGHT once, the next direction can't be RIGHT again (since (1,7) is a wall). So possible directions from (1,6) would be UP (wall), DOWN, LEFT. UP is wall, so options are DOWN or LEFT.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (1,6), then next direction could be DOWN. Let's see where that leads. Head would move to (2,6). Check row 2: \"#     S#\" → column 6 is a space (since S is at 5). So (2,6) is safe. Then, next moves could be DOWN again to (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). Row 6: \"#   A  #\" → column 6 is a space. Then (7,6) is a wall (row 7 is bottom wall). So moving down from (6,6) would hit the wall. Alternatively, moving towards the apple at (6,3) would require moving left from (6,6) to (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) — which is the apple. But that's a longer path.\n\nComparing the two options, moving LEFT allows the snake to reach the apple at (1,1) in 3 moves (epochs 14,15,16), whereas moving RIGHT would take longer to reach any apple. Also, moving LEFT avoids the wall (since moving up is a wall, and moving left is safe). So the best direction is LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A    H#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n# A   S#\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1,5) (row 1, column 5). The current direction is UP, but moving UP would collide with the top wall (row 0), so UP is invalid. The snake cannot reverse direction to DOWN (since reversing from UP to DOWN is not allowed). Thus, the valid directions are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n- **LEFT direction**: The head would move to (1,4) (row 1, column 4), which is empty and safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body). This direction allows the snake to approach the apple at (1,1) (row 1, column 1) in subsequent moves (e.g., next moves LEFT to (1,3), (1,2), then (1,1) to eat the apple).\n- **RIGHT direction**: The head would move to (1,6) (row 1, column 6), which is also empty and safe. However, moving RIGHT further would quickly approach the right wall (column 7), limiting future movement options, and the nearest apple (at (1,1), (4,2), or (6,3)) is farther away compared to the apple reachable via LEFT.\n\nChoosing LEFT is optimal as it safely navigates toward an apple and avoids wall collisions.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #A   HS# → So positions (1,1) is A, (1,4) is H (head), (1,5) is S (body)\nRow 2: #     S# → (2,5) is S\nRow 3: #     S# → (3,5) is S\nRow 4: # A    # → (4,2) is A\nRow 5: #      # → empty\nRow 6: #   A  # → (6,3) is A\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, and the snake is moving left. The snake's head is at (1,4) (since rows are 0-indexed, and columns are 0-indexed). Let's confirm the snake's body positions. The head is H at (1,4). The next body part S is at (1,5) (to the right of the head, which makes sense if the snake was moving left before, because when moving left, the head moves left, and the body follows. So the previous positions would be: the head was at (1,5), then moved left to (1,4), so the body is now at (1,5). Then, row 2 has S at (2,5), row 3 has S at (3,5). So the snake's body is a vertical line down from (1,5) to (3,5). So the snake's path is (1,4) [head] → (1,5) → (2,5) → (3,5). So the length is 4 (head plus 3 bodies).\n\nNow, the snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is LEFT, so the snake can't turn RIGHT (since that's the opposite). The possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed).\n\nLet's think about where the head will move next. If the direction is LEFT, the head moves to (1,3). Let's check if that's a valid position (not a wall, not a body part). (1,3) is in row 1, column 3. Looking at row 1: #A   HS# → columns 0 is #, 1 is A, 2 is space, 3 is space, 4 is H, 5 is S, 6 is #. So (1,3) is a space (empty). So moving LEFT here would take the head to (1,3). Then, the body would follow: the previous head position (1,4) becomes S, and the body parts shift. The apple positions are at (1,1), (4,2), (6,3). \n\nIf we choose UP, the direction. The current direction is LEFT, so turning UP is allowed (not opposite). The head would move up from (1,4) to (0,4). But row 0 is all walls (########), so (0,4) is a wall. That's a collision, game over. So UP is invalid.\n\nIf we choose DOWN, the direction. The head moves down from (1,4) to (2,4). Let's check (2,4). Row 2 is #     S# → columns 0 is #, 1-4 are spaces, 5 is S. So (2,4) is a space (safe). So moving DOWN would take the head to (2,4). Then check if that's a body part. The current body parts are (1,5), (2,5), (3,5). (2,4) is not a body part, so that's safe.\n\nIf we choose LEFT, the head moves to (1,3). Let's check (1,3) is empty (no body, no wall). So that's safe. Now, is there an apple in (1,3)? No. The apples are at (1,1), (4,2), (6,3). So moving LEFT doesn't eat an apple. \n\nWhat about moving DOWN? The head moves to (2,4). Is there an apple there? No. So no score gain. \n\nWhat about the next possible moves? Let's think about the snake's path. The snake's body is at (1,5), (2,5), (3,5). So if the snake continues moving LEFT, next positions would be (1,3), then maybe (1,2), which is (1,2) → row 1, column 2. Let's check (1,2): row 1 is #A   HS# → column 2 is space. So (1,2) is safe. Then (1,1) is an apple. Oh, (1,1) is A. So if the snake keeps moving LEFT, after moving to (1,3), next move (epoch 15 direction LEFT) would take it to (1,2), then (1,1) (epoch 16), which is an apple. That's a good path.\n\nBut if the snake turns DOWN now (epoch 14 direction DOWN), the head moves to (2,4). Then the next direction options would be LEFT, RIGHT (no, can't reverse), UP (current direction would be DOWN, so can't reverse to UP), or DOWN again. Let's see where that leads. (2,4) → next move DOWN to (3,4). (3,4) is in row 3, which is #     S# → column 4 is space. Then (3,4) is safe. Then (4,4) → row 4 is # A    # → column 4 is space. Then (5,4), (6,4). (6,3) is an apple. So (6,4) is adjacent to (6,3). If the snake moves LEFT from (6,4) to (6,3), it can eat that apple. But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now (epoch 14 direction LEFT) would take the head to (1,3). Then, the next direction (epoch 15) can still be LEFT (since current direction is LEFT), moving to (1,2), then (1,1) (apple). That's an apple in two moves. That's better.\n\nSo the possible directions are LEFT, DOWN. UP is invalid (wall). Let's check if moving LEFT is possible. Current direction is LEFT, so moving LEFT is allowed (no reversal). The next position (1,3) is safe (no wall, no body). So that's valid.\n\nSo the best direction here would be LEFT, to head towards the apple at (1,1).\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A   HS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n# A    #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1,4) (row 1, column 4), with its body (S) trailing to the right and down: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. \n\nPossible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since RIGHT is the opposite of the current direction and is invalid). \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0,4), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. Invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (2,4). This position is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe but does not reach an apple immediately.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (1,3). This position is empty (no wall or body), and continuing LEFT in subsequent moves would lead the head toward the apple at (1,1) (row 1, column 1). This path allows the snake to reach an apple in the near future.  \n\nThe safest and most optimal choice is to continue moving LEFT, as it avoids immediate danger and leads toward an apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#A  HSS#\n#     S#\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. Let's break down the snake's position. The head is 'H', and the body parts are 'S'. Let's find the positions of H and S.\n\nLooking at the board row by row (rows are 0 to 7, top to bottom, columns 0 to 7, left to right):\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #A  HSS# → columns 1: A, 4: H, 5:S, 6:S. So row 1, columns 1 (A), 4 (H), 5 (S), 6 (S)\nRow 2: #     S# → column 6: S. So row 2, column 6: S\nRow 3: #      # → no snake here\nRow 4: # A    # → column 2: A\nRow 5: #      # → no snake\nRow 6: #   A  # → column 3: A\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at row 1, column 4. The body (S) is at row 1, column 5; row 1, column 6; and row 2, column 6. Let's list the snake's segments in order (since the snake moves, the head is the front, followed by body parts in the direction of movement). Since the current direction is LEFT, the snake is moving left. So the next position the head would move to is (row 1, column 3), because moving left decreases the column by 1.\n\nNow, let's check possible directions. The player can choose LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN, but cannot reverse direction. The current direction is LEFT. Reversing would be RIGHT (since LEFT's opposite is RIGHT). So the snake can't turn RIGHT. So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nWe need to check which of these directions would not cause a collision (with walls or itself) and preferably lead to eating an apple.\n\nFirst, let's see what happens if we continue moving LEFT (current direction). The head is at (1,4). Moving LEFT would take it to (1,3). Let's check that cell. In row 1, column 3: looking at row 1: \"#A  HSS#\", which is columns 0: #, 1:A, 2: (space), 3: (space), 4:H, 5:S, 6:S, 7:#. So (1,3) is a space. So no collision here. Also, is there an apple there? No. So the snake would move to (1,3), and the body would follow. The tail (the last S) would move, so the body would shift. The snake's length is 4 (H plus 3 S's), so when moving, the head moves to (1,3), and the body segments follow: (1,4) becomes S, (1,5) becomes S, (1,6) becomes S, and the previous tail (row 2, column 6) would be removed (since the snake didn't eat an apple). So that's safe.\n\nNext, check UP direction. Current head is (1,4). Moving UP would take it to row 0, column 4. But row 0 is all walls (########), so (0,4) is a wall. Collision! So UP is invalid.\n\nNext, check DOWN direction. Moving DOWN from (1,4) would take the head to (2,4). Let's check (2,4). Row 2 is \"#     S#\", which is columns 0: #, 1: (space), 2: (space), 3: (space), 4: (space), 5: (space), 6:S, 7:#. So (2,4) is a space. No collision with walls. Now check if that cell has a body part. The current body parts are (1,5), (1,6), (2,6). (2,4) is not a body part, so moving DOWN to (2,4) is safe. Are there any apples there? Let's check the board. The apples are at row 1, column 1 (A), row 4, column 2 (A), row 6, column 3 (A). (2,4) has no apple. So moving DOWN is safe but doesn't eat an apple.\n\nNow, let's see if there's a direction that leads to an apple. Let's check the positions of the apples.\n\nApple positions:\n- (1,1) (row 1, column 1)\n- (4,2) (row 4, column 2)\n- (6,3) (row 6, column 3)\n\nCurrent head position (1,4). Let's see possible paths.\n\nIf moving LEFT (to 1,3), next positions. Then, perhaps next moves. Let's think about the snake's path. The snake is moving left, and after moving left, the head is at (1,3). The body is (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) (since the snake length is 4, when moving, the tail (2,6) would be removed unless an apple is eaten).\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,4) would allow the snake to move towards the apple at (4,2) or (6,3). Let's see. The snake's current direction is LEFT, but if we turn DOWN, the next direction could be adjusted.\n\nWait, the problem is that we need to choose the direction for the next move (epoch 15). The snake moves one square in the direction chosen, provided it's not a reverse. The goal is to eat apples and avoid collision.\n\nAnother thing: the snake's body positions. Let's list all the snake's segments (head first, then body in order of movement). Since direction is LEFT, the head is at (1,4), and the body follows. So the body segments are (1,5), (1,6), (2,6). Because when moving left, the head was previously at (1,5), then (1,6), then (2,6) (since the snake was moving left, each movement would shift the body). Wait, maybe I need to reconstruct the snake's path. Let's think:\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT, which means the previous move was also LEFT (since direction can't reverse). So the head was at (1,5) in the previous step, moved left to (1,4). Then the body segments would be (1,5) (now S), (1,6) (previous S), and (2,6) (the one before that). So the snake's body is (1,5), (1,6), (2,6). So the snake's length is 4 (H + 3 S's). So when moving, the new head position is (1,3) (if direction is LEFT), and the body becomes (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), and the tail (2,6) is removed (since no apple is eaten). So the new body positions would be (1,4), (1,5), (1,6).\n\nNow, let's check if moving LEFT (current direction) is safe. The new head is (1,3), which is empty (no wall, no body). So that's safe.\n\nMoving UP is into a wall, which is bad. So UP is invalid.\n\nMoving DOWN: head to (2,4). (2,4) is empty. No collision. So that's safe.\n\nNow, are there any apples in the next positions of these directions? Let's check:\n\nIf direction is LEFT, new head (1,3) → no apple.\n\nIf direction is DOWN, new head (2,4) → no apple.\n\nWhat about other directions? The possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN (since RIGHT is reverse). UP is invalid. So options are LEFT and DOWN.\n\nWhich is better? Let's think about future moves. Let's see where the apples are. The apples are at (1,1), (4,2), (6,3). The snake is at row 1, column 4. If it continues moving left, it can reach (1,3), then (1,2), then (1,1) (which is an apple). Let's check that path.\n\nCurrent head (1,4). Move LEFT → (1,3). Then next move, direction could still be LEFT (since not reversing). Then (1,2). Then (1,1), which is the apple. So if we keep moving left, we can reach that apple in 3 steps (current epoch 15, next epochs 16, 17, 18). Let's check if that path is possible.\n\nAfter moving LEFT (epoch 15 → 16), head is (1,3). Body is (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). Then, in epoch 16, direction LEFT again (possible), head moves to (1,2). Body becomes (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). Then epoch 17, direction LEFT again, head moves to (1,1), which is the apple. Eating that apple would grow the snake. So that's a good path.\n\nIf we choose DOWN now, the head moves to (2,4). Then, what's next? The direction could be adjusted. For example, from DOWN, next direction could be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (but can't reverse to UP). Let's see. Suppose after moving DOWN to (2,4), next direction could be LEFT (since current direction would be DOWN, so next direction can't be UP). So moving LEFT from (2,4) would take to (2,3). Then maybe towards (4,2) apple. But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now allows the snake to approach the apple at (1,1) directly, which is in the same row. So moving LEFT seems better because it's a straight path to an apple.\n\nAnother thing to check: when moving LEFT, are there any body parts in the path? The current body is (1,5), (1,6), (2,6). The next positions when moving left are (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). None of these are body parts, so no collision.\n\nSo the best direction is LEFT, as it leads towards an apple in the next few steps and is safe.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A  HSS#\n#     S#\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at row 1, column 4. The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. We need to choose a direction from LEFT, UP, or DOWN that avoids collisions and ideally leads to an apple.\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (1,4) would take the head to row 0, column 4, which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). This causes a collision, so UP is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,4) takes the head to (2,4), which is empty (no wall or body). This is safe but does not reach an apple immediately.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1,4) takes the head to (1,3), which is empty (no wall or body). This is safe. Continuing LEFT in subsequent moves would lead the head to (1,2) and then (1,1), where there is an apple. This path avoids collisions and directly approaches an apple.  \n\nThus, the safest and most optimal direction is LEFT.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's situation.\n\nThe game board is 8x8 with walls around. Let me parse the current board row by row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A HSSS#. Let's break this down. The characters here are: #, A, space, H, S, S, S, #. So positions (1,1) is A, (1,3) is H (head), (1,4) S, (1,5) S, (1,6) S.\nRow 2: #      # (all spaces except walls)\nRow 3: #      # (all spaces)\nRow 4: # A    #. So (4,2) is A.\nRow 5: #      # (all spaces)\nRow 6: #   A  #. So (6,3) is A.\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. The head is at (1,3). Moving left would take it to (1,2). Let's check what's there. In row 1, the positions are [0]# [1]A [2] (space) [3]H [4]S [5]S [6]S [7]#. So (1,2) is a space. So if we continue moving LEFT, the head goes to (1,2). Then, the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's current body is SSS, which is (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). When moving left, the head moves to (1,2), the next segment (originally at (1,3)) moves to (1,4) (since the previous head was at (1,3), now it's a body part), and so on. Wait, no. The snake's movement: when moving, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows the previous one's position. So the current snake's body is H at (1,3), followed by S at (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So the length is 4 (head + 3 body segments). When moving left, the head moves to (1,2). Then the next segment (the old head) moves to (1,3), then (1,4) moves to (1,5), (1,5) to (1,6), and (1,6) would move to (1,7) but that's a wall? Wait, no. Wait, the snake's body is H at (1,3), S at (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So the body is in positions (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So when moving left, the head moves to (1,2). Then the body segments shift: the first S (at 1,4) moves to where the head was (1,3), the next S (1,5) moves to (1,4), the last S (1,6) moves to (1,5). So the new body positions would be (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). So the new snake would be H at (1,2), S at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). That's valid because (1,2) is a space, not a wall or body. So moving LEFT is possible.\n\nBut the question is, what direction should we choose. The options are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is LEFT, so reversing would be RIGHT. So we can't choose RIGHT. So possible directions are LEFT (current), UP, or DOWN.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT (current direction). As above, moving left to (1,2). That's a space. No collision. The new position is safe. No apple there (since (1,2) is space, (1,1) is A). So no apple eaten here. The snake moves, but no growth. The epoch is 16, so 84 left, but we need to think about survival and getting apples.\n\n2. UP: Current head is at (1,3). Moving UP would take it to (0,3), which is a wall (row 0 is ########). So moving UP would hit the wall. Game over. So UP is invalid.\n\n3. DOWN: Head at (1,3). Moving DOWN would take it to (2,3). Let's check (2,3). Row 2 is #      #, so (2,3) is space. The snake's body is at (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So (2,3) is not part of the body. So moving DOWN is possible. Let's see if that's a good move. The next position is (2,3). Then, the body segments shift: the first S (1,4) moves to (1,3), (1,5) to (1,4), (1,6) to (1,5). So the new snake would be H at (2,3), S at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). That's safe.\n\nAre there apples in the possible paths? Let's look for apples. The apples are at (1,1), (4,2), (6,3). The current head is at (1,3). If we go LEFT, next position is (1,2). The apple at (1,1) is to the left of that. If we continue moving left, next time (epoch 17) the head would be at (1,1), which is the apple. So if we choose LEFT now, then in the next move, we can eat that apple. But need to check if that's possible. Let's think: current direction is LEFT. If we choose LEFT again (since current direction is LEFT, we can keep moving LEFT). Then epoch 16, direction LEFT: head moves to (1,2). Epoch 17, if direction is still LEFT, head moves to (1,1), which is A. Then we eat the apple, grow, and score increases. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose DOWN now (epoch 16), then head moves to (2,3). Then in epoch 17, what's the direction? We can choose directions again, but can't reverse. If current direction after moving DOWN is DOWN, then possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (since can't reverse to UP). Let's see if moving DOWN leads us towards other apples. The apple at (4,2) is in row 4, column 2. The apple at (6,3) is row 6, column 3. If we go down, we might approach those. But perhaps the immediate apple at (1,1) is easier to reach by continuing LEFT.\n\nSo, the possible moves are LEFT (safe, leads towards apple) or DOWN (safe, but not immediately towards an apple). UP is invalid (wall). RIGHT is reversing, which is not allowed.\n\nSo the best choice is to continue moving LEFT, so that in the next step, we can reach the apple at (1,1). Therefore, the direction to choose now is LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A HSSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. The snake's head is at position (1,3) (row 1, column 3). The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid), and moving UP would take the head to (0,3), which is a wall (game over). Moving DOWN would take the head to (2,3), a safe space but not immediately towards an apple. Continuing LEFT moves the head to (1,2), a safe space, and positions the snake to reach the apple at (1,1) in the next move. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#'. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #AHSSS # → So positions (1,1) is 'A', (1,2) is 'H' (head), (1,3) 'S', (1,4) 'S', (1,5) 'S', and (1,6) is space.\nRow 2: #      # → all spaces except the walls.\nRow 3: #      # → same.\nRow 4: # A    # → (4,2) is 'A'.\nRow 5: #      # → spaces.\nRow 6: #   A  # → (6,3) is 'A'.\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. Let's confirm the snake's body positions. The head is at (1,2) because the row is \"#AHSSS #\". Let's index rows from top (0) to bottom (7), and columns from left (0) to right (7). So row 1, column 1 is 'A', column 2 is 'H' (head), then columns 3,4,5 are 'S's. So the snake's body is H at (1,2), then S at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). Since the snake's length is 4 (head + 3 bodies), because starting length is 1, each apple increases length by 1. So if the snake has 3 S's, that means it has eaten 3 apples. Wait, the initial length is 1 (just H). Each apple eaten adds 1, so if there are 3 S's, the total length is 1 (H) + 3 (S) = 4, so 3 apples eaten. The initial apples were 3, so maybe there are 0 left? Wait, the current board shows apples in row 1 (A at (1,1)), row 4 (A at (4,2)), row 6 (A at (6,3)). So three apples currently on the board. So the snake's length is 4 (H + 3 S), which would mean 3 apples eaten (since starting length 1, 3 apples → 1+3=4). That makes sense.\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. So the next move, if direction remains LEFT, the head would move to (1,1), which is an 'A'. Let's check if that's a valid move. The current head is at (1,2). Moving LEFT would take it to (1,1). Let's check if that's a wall or body. (1,1) is an apple. So if the snake moves LEFT, it would eat the apple, increase the score, and grow. The new head would be at (1,1), and the body would follow. The previous head (1,2) becomes S, and the body parts shift. So after moving LEFT, the snake's new positions would be: head at (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) as S's (since it grows by 1 when eating an apple). So the body length increases by 1.\n\nBut wait, the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is LEFT. So possible directions the player can input are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing would be RIGHT, which is opposite of LEFT). Because the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So from LEFT, the allowed directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. Can't go RIGHT.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's evaluate each option.\n\nFirst, what happens if we choose LEFT:\n\nCurrent head is (1,2). Moving LEFT to (1,1). That's an apple. So the snake eats it. The new head is (1,1). The body segments will be the previous positions. Since the snake grows, the tail doesn't move (since normally, when moving, the tail moves forward, but when eating an apple, the tail stays, increasing length by 1). So the new body would be (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and the new head (1,1). So the snake's length becomes 5 (H + 4 S's). Now, check for collision: (1,1) is not a wall (since walls are on the edges, row 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7). So (1,1) is within the board. No collision with itself, because the new head is at (1,1), and the body is at (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). So that's safe. So moving LEFT is safe and gains an apple.\n\nOption 2: UP. Current direction is LEFT. Can we turn UP? Yes, because UP is not the reverse (reverse is RIGHT). So moving UP would change direction to UP. The head is at (1,2). Moving UP would take it to (0,2). But row 0 is the top wall (all #). So (0,2) is a wall. Collision with wall → game ends. So UP is invalid, leads to loss.\n\nOption 3: DOWN. Current direction is LEFT. Turning DOWN is allowed. The head is at (1,2). Moving DOWN would take it to (2,2). Let's check (2,2). That's a space (row 2 is \"#      #\", so column 2 is space). So (2,2) is empty. Now, check if that's a collision with the body. The current body is at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). So (2,2) is not part of the body. So moving DOWN is safe. But there's no apple there, so no score increase. The snake moves, the tail (1,5) would move to (1,4), (1,4) to (1,3), (1,3) to (1,2), and the head to (2,2). So the new snake positions would be: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). The tail (1,5) would be removed (since no apple eaten, so length remains 4). So the body would be (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and head (2,2). No collision.\n\nSo the options are:\n\n- LEFT: eat apple (good), safe.\n\n- UP: hit wall (game over).\n\n- DOWN: safe, no apple.\n\nSo the best choice is LEFT. Because moving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score, and it's safe. Other options either lead to death (UP) or no gain (DOWN).\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#AHSSS #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. The possible directions to choose are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed). \n\n- **LEFT**: The snake's head (at (1,2)) moves to (1,1), which is an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is safe (no collision with walls or itself) and increases the score. The snake will grow by one segment.  \n- **UP**: The head would move to (0,2), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **DOWN**: The head moves to (2,2), a safe empty space, but no apple is eaten, so no score gain.  \n\nThe best choice is to move LEFT to eat the apple and safely grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. The board is 8x8, surrounded by walls (the #). The snake's head is H, and the body is S. The current direction is LEFT, and we're at epoch 18. The game ends at epoch 100, so there's plenty of time left, but we need to avoid collisions and eat apples.\n\nFirst, let's parse the current game board. Let's write out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #HSSSS # (so columns 1 to 6: H at (1,1), then S at (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). Column 6 is a space.)\nRow 2: #      # (columns 1-6 are spaces)\nRow 3: #      # (same)\nRow 4: # A A  # (columns 2 and 4 are A's)\nRow 5: #      # (spaces)\nRow 6: #   A  # (column 4 is A)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. So the head is at (1,1) (row 1, column 1). Since direction is LEFT, the next move would be to (1,0), but that's a wall (column 0 is part of the wall). Oh wait, columns are 0-7, right? Let's check: row 1 is \"#HSSSS #\", so the characters are index 0: #, 1:H, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 5:S, 6: space, 7: #. So the head is at (row=1, column=1). Moving LEFT from here would take the head to column 0, which is a wall (since the first character of each row is #). So moving LEFT now would cause a collision with the wall, which ends the game. So we can't choose LEFT.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is LEFT, so reversing would be RIGHT. So we can't turn RIGHT (since reversing direction is not allowed). Wait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So if current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT (but LEFT is into a wall, which is bad).\n\nSo possible directions are UP, DOWN, or maybe RIGHT is invalid. Let's confirm: current direction is LEFT. Reversing would be RIGHT. So allowed directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (but LEFT is wall). So the possible directions to choose are UP or DOWN.\n\nNow, where is the snake's body? The body is in row 1, columns 2,3,4,5 (since row 1 is #HSSSS #, so columns 1 is H, 2-5 are S). So the body segments are at (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5).\n\nIf we choose UP: the head is at (1,1). Moving UP would take it to (0,1). But row 0 is all # (the top wall). So (0,1) is a wall. So moving UP would also hit the wall. That's a collision. So UP is invalid.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: the head (1,1) moves down to (2,1). Let's check if that's a valid position. (2,1) is in row 2, column 1. The row 2 is \"#      #\", so column 1 is a space. So that's empty. So that's safe. Now, we need to check if (2,1) is part of the snake's body. The body is in row 1, columns 2-5, and (2,1) is not part of that. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nWhat about apples? Let's see where the apples are. The apples are in row 4, columns 2 and 4 (since row 4 is \"# A A  #\"), and row 6, column 4 (\"#   A  #\"). So apples at (4,2), (4,4), (6,4).\n\nIf we move DOWN, the new head position is (2,1). That's not an apple, so the snake doesn't grow. The body would follow: since the snake's length is 5 (H + 4 S's), when it moves, the tail (the last S) would be removed unless it eats an apple. Wait, the snake starts with length 1 (H), and each apple increases length by 1. The current snake has H followed by 4 S's, so length 5. So that means it has eaten 4 apples (since starting length 1, 4 apples would make length 5).\n\nSo moving DOWN: the head moves to (2,1). The body segments shift: the next positions would be the previous head (1,1) becomes S, then (1,2) becomes S, etc., and the tail (1,5) would be removed (since no apple was eaten). So the new body would be (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and the new head at (2,1). So the new board's row 1 would have \"# SSSS #\", row 2 would have \"#H     #\", etc.\n\nIs there any other possible direction? The only possible directions are UP (wall), LEFT (wall), RIGHT (reverse, invalid), so only DOWN is possible. Because if we choose RIGHT, that's reversing direction (current is LEFT, right is reverse), which is not allowed. So the only valid direction is DOWN.\n\nSo the answer should be DOWN.\n\n\n########\n#HSSSS #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current state:\n\n1. **Current Position and Direction**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 1, column 1). The current direction is LEFT. Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 1, column 0), which is a wall (edge of the board), causing a collision. Thus, LEFT is invalid.\n\n2. **Reversing Direction**: The snake cannot reverse direction. Since the current direction is LEFT, reversing to RIGHT is prohibited.\n\n3. **Other Directions**:\n   - **UP**: Moving UP from (row 1, column 1) leads to (row 0, column 1), which is a wall (top edge). This causes a collision, so UP is invalid.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (row 1, column 1) leads to (row 2, column 1). This position is empty (no wall or snake body), making it safe.\n\nThus, the only valid direction to avoid collision and continue the game is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls as '#'. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SSSS  # (so columns 1-4 are 'S', columns 5-6 are spaces, column 7 is wall)\nRow 2: #H     # (column 1 is 'H', the rest columns 2-6 are spaces, column 7 wall)\nRow 3: #      # (all spaces except walls)\nRow 4: # A A  # (columns 2 and 4 are 'A', others spaces except walls)\nRow 5: #      # (all spaces)\nRow 6: #   A  # (column 4 is 'A', spaces elsewhere)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN. The snake starts with length 1, but now there are 'SSSS' in row 1, and 'H' in row 2. Let's figure out the snake's body positions. Since the snake moves in the direction it's facing, the body segments follow the head. The current direction is DOWN, so the head is moving down. Let's track the snake's body:\n\nThe head (H) is at row 2, column 1 (assuming rows are 0-7 from top to bottom, columns 0-7 left to right). The body segments (S) are in row 1, columns 1-4. So the snake's body is:\n\n- Head: (2,1)\n- Body 1: (1,1)\n- Body 2: (1,2)\n- Body 3: (1,3)\n- Body 4: (1,4)\n\nBecause when moving, each body segment follows the previous one. Since the current direction is DOWN, the next move would be the head moving down to (3,1). Then the body segments would shift: (2,1) becomes S, (1,1) becomes S, (1,2) becomes S, (1,3) becomes S, and (1,4) would maybe stay S? Wait, no. Let's think: when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position. Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the length of the snake is 5 (H + 4 S's). So the current positions are:\n\nHead at (2,1). Then the body is (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). Because when the snake moves, each part follows. Let's confirm. Suppose the snake was moving up before. Because current direction is DOWN. Let's think about how the snake got here.\n\nIf the current direction is DOWN, the previous direction could not be UP (since you can't reverse). So the snake was moving, say, right, then turned down. But perhaps that's not necessary. Let's focus on the next move.\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The possible directions the player can input are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. But the snake cannot reverse direction. So since current direction is DOWN, the player can't input UP (since that's reversing). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nNow, the snake's head is at (2,1). The next move direction options are:\n\n- DOWN: head moves to (3,1)\n- LEFT: head moves to (2,0). But (2,0) is a wall (since row 2 starts with '#', which is column 0). So moving LEFT would hit the wall, causing collision. That's a loss. So LEFT is invalid.\n- RIGHT: head moves to (2,2)\n- UP: can't do that because current direction is DOWN, reversing is not allowed. So UP is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are DOWN or RIGHT. Let's check each.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN: head goes to (3,1). What's in (3,1)? The row 3 is \"#      #\", so (3,1) is a space. Then, the body segments would shift. The previous head position (2,1) becomes S. The body segments (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) would shift: (1,1) moves to (2,1), (1,2) moves to (1,1), (1,3) moves to (1,2), (1,4) moves to (1,3). So the new body positions would be (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). The tail (1,4) would be removed? Wait, no. The snake's length is 5 (H + 4 S's). When moving without eating an apple, the snake's length remains the same. So the head moves to new position, and the tail (last S) is removed. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal positions (length 5):\n\nH at (2,1)\n\nBody: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) (so 4 S's, total length 5)\n\nWhen moving down to (3,1), the new head is (3,1). The next body segment is (2,1) (old head), then (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). The old tail (1,4) is no longer part of the body. So the new body would be S's at (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). So the new board row 1 would be \"#SSS  #\" (since (1,4) is no longer S), row 2 would have S at (2,1), row 3 has H at (3,1). That's safe, no collision.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT: head moves to (2,2). What's there? (2,2) is a space (row 2 is \"#H     #\", so column 2 is space). Then, the body would shift. New head at (2,2). Body segments: (2,1) (old head), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). The tail (1,4) is removed. So row 1 becomes \"#SSS  #\", row 2 becomes \"# SH   #\". That's also safe.\n\nBut we need to check if there's an apple in the next position. Let's check the current positions of apples. The apples are in row 4 (columns 2 and 4), row 6 (column 4). Let's list all 'A's:\n\nRow 4: \"# A A  #\" → columns 2 and 4 (so (4,2) and (4,4))\n\nRow 6: \"#   A  #\" → column 4 (so (6,4))\n\nSo the current head is at (2,1). Next positions:\n\n- If moving DOWN: (3,1) → no apple.\n\n- If moving RIGHT: (2,2) → no apple.\n\nBut the snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's see where the apples are and how to reach them.\n\nThe snake is at (2,1). Let's think about possible paths to apples. The apples are at (4,2), (4,4), (6,4).\n\nIf the snake moves down, then the head is at (3,1). Next possible directions (since direction would now be DOWN, so next possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN). From (3,1), moving down again would take it to (4,1). Then (4,1) is a space (row 4 is \"# A A  #\", column 1 is space). Then, moving right from (4,1) to (4,2) would reach the apple at (4,2). That's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now (from (2,1) to (2,2)), then direction would be RIGHT (since current direction was DOWN, and we turned right, which is allowed). Then, moving right again to (2,3), (2,4), etc. But (2,4) is a space, row 2 is \"#H     #\", so columns 2-6 are spaces. So that's possible, but perhaps not leading to apples quickly.\n\nAnother option: moving down, then down again to (4,1), then right to (4,2) (apple). Let's check if that path is possible.\n\nCurrent head (2,1) → move DOWN to (3,1) (epoch 20). Then, next direction can be DOWN (current direction would be DOWN now, so allowed). Move to (4,1) (epoch 21). Then, direction can be RIGHT (since current direction is DOWN, turning right is allowed). Move to (4,2) (epoch 22). That's the apple at (4,2). Eating it would increase the score, and the snake would grow. That's a good plan.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT now (to (2,2)), then next direction could be RIGHT again (since direction would be RIGHT now, as previous was DOWN). Then, moving right to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) (but (2,6) is a wall, so can't go there). Then maybe down. But that path might not reach apples as quickly.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves down now, then down again, then right, it can reach the apple in (4,2) in 3 moves. That seems better.\n\nSo the best direction now is to continue moving DOWN. Because moving LEFT would hit the wall (invalid), moving UP is reversing (invalid), moving RIGHT is possible but maybe not the best path. So the correct direction is DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#H     #\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (row 2, column 1). Body segments (S) are in row 1, columns 1-4 (length 5).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN (snake cannot reverse to UP).\n- **Valid Moves**: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (UP is invalid due to reversal rule).\n- **Apple Positions**: (row 4, column 2), (row 4, column 4), and (row 6, column 4).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Would move head to (row 2, column 0), which is a wall. Collision → game over. Invalid.\n2. **UP**: Reverses direction (current direction is DOWN). Invalid.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moves head to (row 2, column 2). Safe (no collision), but this position has no apple. This path may not lead to apples quickly.\n4. **DOWN**: Moves head to (row 3, column 1). Safe (no collision). This direction aligns with a path toward the nearest apple at (row 4, column 2):\n   - After moving DOWN, the snake can continue moving DOWN to (row 4, column 1) (next epoch), then RIGHT to (row 4, column 2) (subsequent epoch) to eat the apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is the safest and most strategic choice, as it avoids immediate collision and positions the snake to reach an apple in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as required. The board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SSS   # (so positions (1,1) to (1,3) are 'S', then spaces)\nRow 2: #S     # (position (2,1) is 'S')\nRow 3: #H     # (position (3,1) is 'H' which is the head)\nRow 4: # A A  # (apples at (4,2) and (4,4))\nRow 5: #      # (all spaces)\nRow 6: #   A  # (apple at (6,4))\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. The snake's body is made of 'S's. Let's map the snake's body positions. The head is at (3,1). The body is in row 2, column 1 (since row 2 is #S     #, so (2,1) is S). Then row 1 has #SSS   #, so (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are S. So the snake's body positions (from head to tail) would be:\n\nHead: (3,1)\nThen next part: (2,1) (since moving up from head would be previous position, but current direction is DOWN, so the previous direction was probably UP? Wait, the snake moves one square at a time. Let's think about the movement. The snake's body follows the head. So when the head moves, each body part moves to the position of the previous part.\n\nThe snake's current body is: the head is at (3,1). The body is in (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). Because row 1 has three S's. So the snake's length is 5 (head + 4 body segments). Because row 1 has SSS (3), row 2 has S (1), row 3 has H (1), total 3+1+1=5? Let's count: H is 1, S's are 4 (row 2 has 1, row 1 has 3), so total length 5.\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. So the next move will be the head moving down one square. The next head position would be (4,1) (since current head is (3,1), moving down (row increases by 1, column same). Let's check where (4,1) is. Looking at row 4: # A A  #. So (4,1) is a space (since the row is # [space] A [space] A [space][space], so columns 0 is #, column 1 is space, column 2 is A, column 3 is space, column 4 is A, etc. So (4,1) is a space. So moving down would take the head to (4,1), which is safe (no collision with walls or self).\n\nBut maybe there's a better direction. The player can choose direction, but can't reverse. Current direction is DOWN. So the snake can't reverse to UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. Because reversing (UP) is not allowed.\n\nLet's check possible directions:\n\n1. Continue DOWN: head moves to (4,1). Then the body follows. The new head is (4,1), the previous head (3,1) becomes S, then (2,1) becomes S, (1,1) becomes S, (1,2) becomes S, and the tail (1,3) remains S? Wait, when the snake moves, the tail only moves if the snake doesn't eat an apple. Since in the example given, when the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move (so the snake grows). So when the snake moves and doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward (i.e., the last body segment is removed). When it eats an apple, the tail stays, so the snake's length increases.\n\nSo in the current state, if the snake moves DOWN to (4,1), which is a space (no apple), then the tail (1,3) would be removed. Let's confirm. The snake's current body positions (from head to tail) are:\n\nHead: (3,1)\nBody1: (2,1) (previous head position)\nBody2: (1,1) (previous Body1)\nBody3: (1,2) (previous Body2)\nBody4: (1,3) (previous Body3) [tail]\n\nWhen moving down to (4,1), the new head is (4,1). The new body positions would be:\n\nBody1: (3,1) (old head)\nBody2: (2,1) (old Body1)\nBody3: (1,1) (old Body2)\nBody4: (1,2) (old Body3)\nTail: (1,3) would be removed (since no apple eaten), so the new tail is (1,2)? Wait, maybe I should think of the snake as a list. Let's model the snake's positions as a list where the first element is the head.\n\nCurrent snake positions (assuming the snake's movement history): Let's think. The snake was moving in direction, and each step the head moves, body follows. Let's assume that the snake's current positions are in order [H, S, S, S, S], but perhaps the order is head followed by the body segments in the direction of the tail.\n\nAlternatively, the snake's body is a sequence. For example, if the snake was moving up, then the head was at (3,1), then the previous position (4,1) would be next, but that's not the case here. Let's see the current positions:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 3 (index 3) has H at (3,1).\n\nRow 2 (index 2) has S at (2,1).\n\nRow 1 (index 1) has S at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nSo the snake's body is arranged as follows:\n\nHead at (3,1). Then, moving up (since (2,1) is S), then (1,1) is S, then (1,2) S, then (1,3) S. So the snake's path is: (3,1) → (2,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3). So the direction the snake is moving is DOWN (current direction), so the next head position would be (4,1) (since moving down from (3,1) is row+1, column same).\n\nNow, the possible directions the player can choose are: since current direction is DOWN, the player can't reverse to UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\nLet's evaluate each option.\n\nOption 1: DOWN (continue current direction). Next head position is (4,1). Check (4,1) on the board. Row 4 is \"# A A  #\". Columns 0 is #, 1 is space (since index 1), 2 is A, 3 is space, 4 is A, 5 is space, 6 is space, 7 is #. So (4,1) is a space. No apple here, so the snake moves here. The new body positions would be: the old head (3,1) becomes S, (2,1) becomes S, (1,1) becomes S, (1,2) becomes S, and the tail (1,3) is removed (since no apple eaten, length remains same). So the new board after moving DOWN would have head at (4,1), body at (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). Then, the tail (1,3) is gone. This is safe, no collision.\n\nOption 2: LEFT. Current direction is DOWN, so turning LEFT is allowed (not reversing). Moving LEFT would mean the head moves to (3,0). But (3,0) is a wall (since the first column is #). So moving LEFT would cause a wall collision. Game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nOption 3: RIGHT. Turning RIGHT from DOWN is allowed. The head would move to (3,2). Let's check (3,2) on the board. Row 3 is \"#H     #\", so (3,1) is H, (3,2) is space. So (3,2) is a space. No collision here. Then, the new head is (3,2). The body follows: the old head (3,1) becomes S, (2,1) becomes S, (1,1) becomes S, (1,2) becomes S, and the tail (1,3) is removed (since no apple eaten). So this is safe.\n\nWait, but after moving RIGHT, the direction becomes RIGHT. Let's confirm: when you change direction, the snake's next move is in the new direction. So if current direction is DOWN, and you input RIGHT, the next movement is to the right (column increases by 1). The head is at (3,1), moving right to (3,2). That's valid.\n\nNow, what about apples? The apples are at (4,2), (4,4), (6,4). Let's see if moving in any direction can reach an apple.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (4,1), then the next move (epoch 21) would have the head at (4,1). Then, the next possible moves. Let's think about possible future moves. The apple at (4,2) is to the right of (4,1). So if after moving down, the snake is at (4,1), direction is DOWN. Then, next move could be RIGHT (since direction is DOWN, can turn right), moving to (4,2) which is an apple. That would be good. So eating that apple would increase the score.\n\nAlternatively, if we move RIGHT now (epoch 20), head goes to (3,2). Then, direction is RIGHT. Next move (epoch 21) would be to (3,3). Then, perhaps moving down towards the apples in row 4.\n\nBut let's check if moving RIGHT now is safe. The current body is (3,1) (head), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). If the head moves to (3,2), the new body positions would be (3,1) (old head), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). The tail (1,3) is removed. So (3,2) is a new position, no collision with body. So that's safe.\n\nBut let's check if moving DOWN now (epoch 20) to (4,1) is safe, and then in epoch 21, can we reach an apple.\n\nIn epoch 20, moving DOWN: head at (4,1). Then, in epoch 21, possible directions (current direction is now DOWN). The player can choose directions (can't reverse to UP). So possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nAt (4,1), moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,2), which is an apple. That's perfect. So if we move DOWN now, then in the next step, we can move RIGHT to eat the apple at (4,2). That would be a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now (epoch 20) to (3,2), then in epoch 21, direction is RIGHT. The head would move to (3,3). Then, perhaps moving down towards (4,3), then (4,4) (which is an apple). But (4,4) is an apple. Let's see:\n\nIf in epoch 20, direction is RIGHT, head moves to (3,2). Then epoch 21: direction is RIGHT, head moves to (3,3). Then epoch 22: direction could be DOWN (from RIGHT, can turn down), head moves to (4,3). Then epoch 23: direction is DOWN, head moves to (5,3). Then epoch 24: direction is DOWN, head moves to (6,3). Then epoch 25: direction is RIGHT to (6,4), which is an apple. That's a longer path, but maybe possible.\n\nBut the apple at (4,2) is closer. So moving DOWN now (epoch 20) to (4,1), then RIGHT (epoch 21) to (4,2) (apple) is better. So the best move now is to continue moving DOWN, then next step RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\nSo the current direction is DOWN. The possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. LEFT is invalid (wall). So options are DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nMoving DOWN now (epoch 20) to (4,1) is safe. Then, in the next step (epoch 21), the direction would be DOWN, and we can choose to turn RIGHT to (4,2) (apple). So that's a better path.\n\nTherefore, the best direction to choose now is DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSS   #\n#S     #\n#H     #\n# A A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,1) (row 3, column 1) and is currently moving DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). The possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (3,0), which is a wall. This causes an immediate collision and game over.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3,2), a safe empty space. However, this does not immediately approach an apple.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (4,1), a safe empty space. From (4,1), the next move can be RIGHT to reach the apple at (4,2) (row 4, column 2), allowing the snake to eat the apple and grow.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to continue moving DOWN to position (4,1), setting up the next move to collect an apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#SS    #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, and the current epoch is 21. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S', apples are 'A', and walls are '#'. The snake starts moving in the direction it's facing, which is DOWN here. The snake can't reverse direction, so from DOWN, it can't go UP. The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since reversing is not allowed).\n\nFirst, let's find the position of the snake's head. Looking at the board, the 4th row (since rows are 0-indexed or 1-indexed? Let's check: the first line is row 0, so rows 0 to 7. The 4th row (index 4) is \"#HA A  #\". So the 'H' is in row 4, column 1 (since columns are 0-indexed, the characters are: 0:'#', 1:'H', 2:'A', 3:' ', 4:'A', 5:' ', 6:' ', 7:'#'). So head is at (4,1).\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, so the next move without changing direction would be to row 5, column 1. Let's check what's there. The 5th row is \"#      #\", so row 5, column 1 is a space ' '. So moving DOWN would take the head to (5,1). Since that's empty, the snake moves there. The body would follow: the previous head position (4,1) becomes 'S', and the new head is (5,1). But wait, the snake's body is the existing 'S's. Let's track the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board, the 'S's are in row 1: \"#SS    #\" (columns 1 and 2), row 2: \"#S     #\" (column 1), row 3: \"#S     #\" (column 1). So the snake's body is a vertical line going up from row 4 (H at (4,1)) up to row 1. So the snake's segments are:\n\nHead at (4,1)\nThen (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) — because row 1 has \"SS\" which is (1,1) and (1,2). So the snake's body is a chain from (4,1) up to (1,2). So the body is in positions (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2).\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN (current direction), the new head would be (5,1). Let's check if that's a wall or body. The walls are the borders, so row 5 is within 0-7, column 1 is within 0-7 (since columns 0 and 7 are walls). So (5,1) is not a wall. Is it part of the body? The body is (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). So (5,1) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe. Then, after moving, the previous head (4,1) becomes 'S', and the new head is (5,1). The body segments shift: the last segment (1,2) would be removed if the snake doesn't eat an apple. Wait, no. The snake's length increases when it eats an apple. Since the current length is 1 (head) plus the number of 'S's. Let's count the 'S's: row 1 has two 'S's (columns 1 and 2), row 2 has one 'S' (column 1), row 3 has one 'S' (column 1). So total 'S's: 2+1+1=4. So the snake's current length is 1 (head) +4 (body) =5. So when moving, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (last body segment) will be removed. So the body is a queue: new head, then previous head becomes body, and the last body segment is removed.\n\nNow, let's check possible directions. The current direction is DOWN. The snake can't reverse, so can't go UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n1. DOWN: Move to (5,1). Check if that's an apple. The 5th row is \"#      #\", so (5,1) is ' ', no apple. So no growth. The snake moves, new head (5,1), previous head (4,1) becomes 'S', and the tail (the last 'S') is removed. The current body's tail is (1,2), since the body is (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1 is head). Wait, maybe the body is ordered from head to tail. Let's think: the head is (4,1). The next segment is (3,1) (since row 3 has 'S' in column 1), then (2,1) (row 2), then (1,1) (row 1), then (1,2) (row 1, column 2). So the body segments are (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). So the tail is (1,2). So when moving, if not eating an apple, the tail (1,2) would be removed (turned into empty space). So after moving DOWN, the new body would be (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). The new head is (5,1). The tail (1,2) becomes ' '.\n\n2. LEFT: Direction LEFT would mean moving the head to (4,0). But column 0 is a wall ('#'), so that's a collision. The game would end. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n3. RIGHT: Direction RIGHT would move the head to (4,2). Let's check (4,2) on the board. The 4th row is \"#HA A  #\", so column 2 is 'A'. Oh, that's an apple! So moving RIGHT would make the head go to (4,2), which is an apple. So the snake eats the apple, grows in length (so the tail isn't removed), and the score increases by 1. Let's confirm: current head is (4,1). Moving RIGHT (column increases by 1) to (4,2). That's an 'A'. So that's valid. Then, the new head is (4,2), which is now 'H', the previous head (4,1) becomes 'S'. Since the snake ate an apple, the tail (1,2) remains. So the body now includes all previous segments plus the new 'S' at (4,1). So the snake's length increases by 1. Also, no collision here because (4,2) is not a wall (column 2 is within 1-6, since walls are 0 and 7) and not part of the body. The body is (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). (4,2) is not in those positions, so safe.\n\nSo moving RIGHT would eat an apple, which is good. Moving DOWN is safe but doesn't get an apple. Moving LEFT is a wall collision, which ends the game. So the best choice is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS    #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4,1) (row 4, column 1), moving in the current direction \"DOWN\". The snake cannot reverse direction (so \"UP\" is invalid). The possible directions to choose are \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", or \"DOWN\".\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (4,0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. Invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (5,1). This square is empty (' '), so the snake moves safely but does not eat an apple. No score increase, and the tail (last body segment) would shrink.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (4,2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, the snake grows in length (no tail shrinkage), and no collision occurs (the square is not a wall or part of the snake's body).\n\nThe optimal choice is to move RIGHT to eat the apple and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let's list out each row to get the positions right:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SS    # (so positions (1,1) and (1,2) are 'S' (body), rest empty except walls)\nRow 2: #S     # (position (2,1) is 'S')\nRow 3: #S     # (position (3,1) is 'S')\nRow 4: #SH A  # (position (4,1) is 'S', (4,2) is 'H' (head), (4,4) is 'A' (apple))\nRow 5: #      # (all empty except walls)\nRow 6: #A  A  # (positions (6,1) and (6,4) are 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction, so if it's moving RIGHT, it can't immediately go LEFT. The possible directions to choose from are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse of RIGHT and not allowed).\n\nFirst, let's find the head's current position. The head 'H' is in row 4, column 2 (assuming rows are 0-7 and columns 0-7, with (row, column) notation). So (4,2). Since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move would be to (4,3) if we continue RIGHT. Let's check what's there. Looking at row 4: #SH A  #. The columns are 0: #, 1:S, 2:H, 3: (space), 4:A, 5: (space), 6: (space), 7:#. So (4,3) is empty (a space). So moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,3). That's safe, no collision with walls or self.\n\nWhat about other directions? Let's check UP. Current direction is RIGHT. The snake can turn UP. The head is at (4,2). Moving UP would take it to (3,2). Let's check (3,2). Row 3 is #S     #. Columns 0: #, 1:S, 2: (space), 3: (space), 4: (space), 5: (space), 6: (space), 7:#. So (3,2) is empty. So moving UP is possible. No collision there.\n\nMoving DOWN: head is (4,2). DOWN would be (5,2). Row 5 is #      #, so (5,2) is empty. That's safe too.\n\nNow, let's check the apples. The apples are at (4,4), (6,1), (6,4). The snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's see where each direction leads.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. If we go RIGHT, next head position is (4,3). Then, the next move after that (if we keep going RIGHT) would be (4,4), which is an apple. That's good. So moving RIGHT now would allow the snake to reach the apple at (4,4) in the next step.\n\nIf we go UP now, head moves to (3,2). Then, possible next directions. Let's see if that path leads to apples. The apple at (4,4) is to the right of the current head. If we go UP, maybe we can turn right again. But maybe that's a longer path.\n\nIf we go DOWN, head moves to (5,2). Then, perhaps moving towards the apples in row 6 (positions (6,1) and (6,4)). But (6,1) is an apple, but (5,2) down to (6,2) would be next. (6,1) is to the left of (6,2). So maybe that's a possible path, but maybe not as immediate as the apple at (4,4).\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's body. Let's map the body positions. The snake's body is 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2)\nRow 2: (2,1)\nRow 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1)\nSo the body is a vertical line along column 1, from row 1 to row 4, and then in row 1, columns 1 and 2. So the body's positions are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). The head is at (4,2). So the snake's body is like a line going down column 1, then turns right to (1,2), and the head is at (4,2). So the snake's current shape is like a vertical line (column 1, rows 1-4) with a horizontal part in row 1 (columns 1-2), and the head at (4,2).\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (4,3), that's safe. The next position (4,3) is empty, so no collision. Then, if the next move is RIGHT again (since direction can be maintained), the head would go to (4,4), which is an apple. Eating that apple would make the snake grow. That's a good move.\n\nIf the snake turns UP now (direction UP), the head moves to (3,2). Let's check if (3,2) is part of the body. The body positions are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). (3,2) is not in the body, so it's safe. Then, the next direction could be RIGHT again (since you can't reverse from UP to DOWN, but can go RIGHT). Then, moving RIGHT from (3,2) would take to (3,3), then (3,4), etc. Maybe that's a path, but the apple at (4,4) is closer if we continue RIGHT.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (5,2), that's safe. Then, the next direction could be RIGHT, leading towards (5,3), (5,4), etc. But (5,4) is empty (row 5 is all spaces). The apple at (4,4) is in row 4, column 4. So if the snake is in row 5, column 2, moving up to row 4, column 2 (but that's where the head was before moving down, but the body would have moved). Wait, after moving, the snake's body shifts. Let's think about how the snake moves. The snake's body follows the head. Each move, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So, when the head moves, the body follows. So, for example, if the head is at (4,2) and moves RIGHT to (4,3), then the body segments would shift: the 'S' at (4,1) would move to (4,2) (since the head was there), the 'S' at (3,1) would move to (4,1), and so on. So the body is a trail following the head.\n\nSo, if the snake moves RIGHT, the new head is (4,3). The body segments would be:\n\nPrevious head was (4,2) → becomes 'S' (since the head has moved). The previous body at (4,1) → moves to (4,2). The body at (3,1) → moves to (4,1). The body at (2,1) → moves to (3,1). The body at (1,1) → moves to (2,1). The body at (1,2) → moves to (1,1). Wait, but the original body in row 1 is (1,1) and (1,2). So the snake's length is 5 (since there are 5 'S's plus the 'H' → length 6? Let's count: 'H' is 1, 'S's are 5. So length 6. When the snake moves, the body follows. So the movement would be:\n\nOriginal positions (head H at (4,2), body S at (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)). So the order of the snake is H at (4,2), then S at (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). So when moving RIGHT, the new head is (4,3). The next segment (the old head) becomes S at (4,2). Then the next segments are (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). The last segment (originally at (1,2)) would move to (1,1), but (1,1) is already occupied by the previous segment. Wait, maybe I need to think of the snake as a list of coordinates, with the head first. Let's list the snake's coordinates in order (head first):\n\nHead: (4,2)\nBody segments in order: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)\n\nSo when the snake moves RIGHT, the new head is (4,3). The body segments shift: each segment takes the position of the previous one. So new body segments are (4,2) (old head), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). The last segment (originally (1,2)) would be removed if the snake doesn't grow. Wait, but the snake only grows when it eats an apple. Since moving RIGHT now (to (4,3)) doesn't eat an apple (the apple is at (4,4)), the snake's length remains the same. So the tail (the last segment) would move forward, and the tail end would be removed. So the new body after moving RIGHT would be:\n\nHead: (4,3)\nBody: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1)\n\nThe old tail (1,2) is no longer part of the snake, so that position becomes empty. So the board after moving RIGHT would have (1,2) as empty, and (4,3) as H, (4,2) as S, etc.\n\nNow, the next move (epoch 23) would be in direction RIGHT again (if we choose to continue). Then the head would move to (4,4), which is an apple. Eating that apple would make the snake grow. So the snake's length increases by 1, so the tail (which was (1,1) in the previous step) would not be removed. So after eating the apple, the new head is (4,4), and the body segments would be (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). So that's a good move.\n\nIf the snake turns UP now, moving to (3,2), let's see. The new head is (3,2). The body segments would shift: (4,2) (old head), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). The tail (1,2) is removed. Then, in the next step, possible directions could be RIGHT (since current direction would be UP, and you can turn RIGHT (allowed, since not reversing)). So moving RIGHT from (3,2) would take to (3,3). Then (3,4) which is empty. Then (3,5), etc. But the apple at (4,4) is in row 4, so maybe the snake would have to go down again. That might take longer.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (5,2), the new head is (5,2). The body segments would be (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). The tail (1,2) is removed. Then, next possible direction could be RIGHT, moving to (5,3), (5,4), etc. But (5,4) is empty, and the apple at (4,4) is in row 4, so moving up from (5,4) to (4,4) would be possible. But that's two steps away, whereas moving RIGHT now and then RIGHT again would reach the apple in the next step (epoch 23).\n\nSo the best move is to continue moving RIGHT, which will allow the snake to reach the apple at (4,4) in the next move. That way, the snake can eat the apple, increase the score, and grow longer. Also, moving RIGHT now is safe (no collision with walls or body), so it's a valid direction.\n\n\n########\n#SS    #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SH A  #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (4,2) (row 4, column 2). The body ('S') occupies positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (4,4), (6,1), (6,4).\n- **Goal**: Move safely toward apples to maximize score.\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **RIGHT**:  \n   Moving RIGHT from (4,2) takes the head to (4,3), which is empty (no collision with walls or self). This is safe. The next move (if continuing RIGHT) would reach (4,4), where an apple is located. Eating this apple would grow the snake and increase the score. This path directly targets the nearest apple.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Moving UP from (4,2) takes the head to (3,2), which is empty. However, this moves the snake away from the nearest apple at (4,4), requiring additional steps to reorient toward it.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Moving DOWN from (4,2) takes the head to (5,2), which is empty. This also moves the snake away from the nearest apple at (4,4), delaying apple consumption.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is optimal as it safely directs the snake toward the nearest apple at (4,4) in the next move, maximizing score potential.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8 with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's body is 'S', the head is 'H', and apples are 'A'. The current direction is RIGHT, and the epoch is 23. \n\nLet me map out the board row by row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #S     # → So positions (1,1) is S, others are empty except walls at 0 and 7.\nRow 2: #S     # → (2,1) is S\nRow 3: #S     # → (3,1) is S\nRow 4: #SSHA  # → Let's break this down. The row starts with #, then positions (4,1)=S, (4,2)=S, (4,3)=H, (4,4)=A. So row 4 columns 1-4 are S, S, H, A.\nRow 5: #      # → Empty except walls.\nRow 6: #A  A  # → (6,1)=A, (6,4)=A.\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at position (4,3). The current direction is RIGHT, which means the next move would be to the right (column increases by 1). Let's check where the head would move if we continue RIGHT. The current head is at (4,3), moving RIGHT would take it to (4,4), which is an 'A' (apple). So if we go RIGHT, the snake will eat the apple. That's good because it increases the score and the snake grows. \n\nBut wait, we need to check if there are any collisions. If we move RIGHT, the new head position is (4,4), which is an apple. The snake's body is currently: let's list all the S and H positions. The H is at (4,3). The S's are at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2). So the body is a vertical line along column 1 from row 1 to 3, then in row 4, columns 1 and 2. So the body is like a vertical line down column 1, then turns right into row 4, columns 1 and 2, then the head at (4,3).\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (4,4), which is the apple. Since the snake is moving into an apple, it will grow. The snake's length increases by 1. The previous tail (the last S) would not be removed because when the snake eats an apple, it doesn't lose the tail. So the new body would include all existing S's plus the previous head position (4,3) becomes S, and the new head is (4,4). Let's confirm: when the snake moves, normally, the head moves forward, and the tail (last segment) is removed. But when it eats an apple, the tail isn't removed, so the length increases by 1. \n\nNow, what directions are possible? The current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since reversing would be LEFT, which is opposite of RIGHT, so that's not allowed). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. RIGHT: New head position (4,4). That's an apple. So eating it. No collision here because (4,4) is not a wall (walls are at column 0 and 7 in each row) and not a body part. The body parts are at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) (since H is at (4,3) before moving). The new head is (4,4), which is not in the body positions. So this is safe. The snake will grow, score increases by 1.\n\n2. UP: Current direction is RIGHT. Turning UP is allowed (not reversing). The head is at (4,3). Moving UP would take it to (3,3). Let's check (3,3) on the board. Row 3 is \"#S     #\", so (3,1) is S, (3,3) is empty (since the row is # S followed by 5 spaces and #). So (3,3) is empty. Are there any body parts there? The body parts are (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (3,3) is not in these positions. So moving UP to (3,3) is safe. But there's no apple there, so the snake would move, the tail (the last S) would be removed. The tail is currently the first S in the body. Let's see, the snake's body is a sequence. The head is (4,3), then the body segments are (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). So the tail is (1,1). If moving UP, the new head is (3,3), and the tail (1,1) is removed. So the new body would be (4,3) (old head), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So the new positions would be (3,3)=H, (4,3)=S, (4,2)=S, (4,1)=S, (3,1)=S, (2,1)=S. No collision here, but no apple eaten.\n\n3. DOWN: Current direction RIGHT. Turning DOWN is allowed. Head at (4,3) moving DOWN to (5,3). Check (5,3) on the board. Row 5 is \"#      #\", so (5,3) is empty. Body parts are as before, so (5,3) is safe. No apple here. So moving DOWN would just move the snake, no apple, tail (1,1) is removed.\n\nThe best option is to move RIGHT, because that's where the apple is. Eating the apple increases the score and the snake grows. There's no collision risk here. So the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\n########\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SSHA  #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (4,3) (row 4, column 3).\n- Current direction is RIGHT, so the snake is moving rightward.\n- Possible directions (cannot reverse): UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n- The cell to the RIGHT of the head is (4,4), which contains an apple ('A').\n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n1. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (4,4), which is an apple. Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. The new head position (4,4) is not a wall or part of the snake's body (current body segments are at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)), so no collision occurs. This is safe and beneficial.\n2. **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (3,3). This cell is empty (no apple) and not a collision, but provides no score gain.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (5,3). This cell is empty (no apple) and not a collision, but provides no score gain.\n\nThe best choice is to move RIGHT to eat the apple and grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #S     #\nRow 2: #S   A #\nRow 3: #S     #\nRow 4: #SSSH  #\nRow 5: #      #\nRow 6: #A  A  #\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head is at position H. Let's find the coordinates. Rows are 0 to 7, columns 0 to 7 (since each row has 8 characters, 0-based). Let's check row 4: \"#SSSH  #\". The characters here are: index 0 is '#', 1 is 'S', 2 is 'S', 3 is 'S', 4 is 'H', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So H is at (4,4). \n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right. The next move, if we keep direction RIGHT, the head would move to (4,5). Let's check what's there. Row 4, column 5 is ' ' (empty). So moving right would take H to (4,5). But we need to check if that's a valid move (no collision with walls or self).\n\nThe walls are the borders, so columns 0 and 7 in each row are walls. The head is at (4,4), moving right to (4,5). Column 5 is within 1-6 (since 0 and 7 are walls), so no wall collision. Now check if (4,5) is part of the snake's body. The snake's body is represented by 'S'. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1: column 1: (1,1)\nRow 2: column 1: (2,1)\nRow 3: column 1: (3,1)\nRow 4: columns 1,2,3: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\nSo (4,5) is empty, so moving right is safe.\n\nBut maybe there's a better direction. The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (but can't reverse, so LEFT is reverse? Wait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So current direction is RIGHT. Reversing would be LEFT. So the snake can't turn LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since continuing same direction is allowed).\n\nSo possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Continue RIGHT: Next head position (4,5). Is that a valid move? As above, yes. Then, after moving, the snake's body will shift. Since the current length is the number of 'S's plus 1 (H). Let's count S:\n\nRow 1: 1 S (1,1)\nRow 2: 1 S (2,1)\nRow 3: 1 S (3,1)\nRow 4: 3 S's (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\nTotal S's: 1+1+1+3 = 6. So snake length is 6 (body) + 1 (head) = 7. When moving, the tail (the last S) would be removed unless an apple is eaten. Let's check if (4,5) has an apple. No, row 4, column 5 is ' ', so no apple. So after moving right, the head is at (4,5), and the tail (the last S) is removed. The snake's body would now be (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) (since the head was at (4,4), now moves to (4,5), so the body follows: the previous positions shift. Wait, in snake movement, each part follows the one in front. So when the head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the current body segments are:\n\nThe head is at (4,4). The body is a sequence leading up to the tail. Let's think of the snake's body as a list, with head first. So the order would be H at (4,4), then S's in the order they follow. The S's are connected, so the snake's body path must be contiguous. Let's reconstruct the snake's path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 4 has #SSSH  #. So from left to right: (4,1)=S, (4,2)=S, (4,3)=S, (4,4)=H. So the head is at (4,4), and the body segments immediately before it are (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). Then, row 3 has #S     #, so (3,1)=S. Row 2 has #S   A #, (2,1)=S. Row 1 has #S     #, (1,1)=S. So the snake's body is a vertical line from (1,1) down to (4,1), then right to (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) (head). So the snake's path is:\n\nHead (H) at (4,4) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (4,1) → (3,1) → (2,1) → (1,1) (tail). So the snake's length is 7 (head + 6 body segments).\n\nSo when moving, the head moves in the direction, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if the head moves right to (4,5), then the next segment (the one behind the head) moves to (4,4), then (4,3) moves to (4,2), etc. The tail (1,1) would move to... Wait, no. When the snake moves without eating an apple, the tail is removed. So the new body after moving would be:\n\nNew head: (4,5)\nBody segments: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\nTail: (1,1) is removed. Because the snake's length remains the same unless it eats an apple.\n\nSo moving right would take the head to (4,5), which is safe. But are there apples nearby that we can reach?\n\nLooking for apples (A) on the board:\n\nRow 2, column 4: (2,4) → \"#S   A #\" → positions 0 is '#', 1 is 'S', 2 is ' ', 3 is ' ', 4 is 'A', 5 is ' ', 6 is '#'. So (2,4) is A.\n\nRow 6: \"#A  A  #\" → positions 1 is 'A', 4 is 'A'. So (6,1) and (6,4) are A.\n\nSo apples at (2,4), (6,1), (6,4).\n\nCurrent head is at (4,4). Let's see possible directions and if they can reach apples.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. If we go RIGHT, head to (4,5). Next possible moves from there. But perhaps other directions can get to apples faster.\n\nOption 2: Direction UP. The current direction is RIGHT, so turning UP is allowed (not reversing). The head is at (4,4). Moving UP would take it to (3,4). Let's check (3,4): row 3 is \"#S     #\". So (3,0) is '#', (3,1) is 'S', (3,2-6) are spaces. So (3,4) is ' ', which is empty. So moving UP to (3,4) is safe. Then, check if (3,4) has an apple. No. Then, after moving, the body would adjust. The new head is (3,4), previous head (4,4) becomes body, then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), and tail (1,1) is removed.\n\nOption 3: Direction DOWN. Current direction is RIGHT, so turning DOWN is allowed. Head at (4,4) moving DOWN would go to (5,4). Check (5,4): row 5 is \"#      #\", which is all spaces except the walls. So (5,4) is ' ', safe. Then, no apple there.\n\nNow, which direction can lead the snake towards an apple? Let's see the positions of apples:\n\nApple at (2,4) is above the current head (4,4). The head is at (4,4), (2,4) is two rows up (row 2). So if the snake moves UP, then perhaps can reach that apple.\n\nIf the snake is currently moving RIGHT, and turns UP, next position (3,4). Then, if direction remains UP, next move to (2,4) which is the apple. That would be good. Because (2,4) is an A. So moving UP now, then next move UP again would reach the apple. Let's check:\n\nCurrent head (4,4). If direction is UP, next head (3,4). Then, next move (if direction remains UP) would be (2,4), which is the apple. So that's two moves. That's a good path.\n\nIf we continue moving RIGHT, the head goes to (4,5). Then, possible directions from there. But (4,5) is empty. Then, maybe move UP, but not sure.\n\nAnother apple is at (6,1) and (6,4). (6,4) is in row 6, column 4. The head is at (4,4). So (6,4) is two rows down. If the snake moves DOWN, then next position (5,4), then (6,4) (apple). That's also two moves. Let's check:\n\nCurrent head (4,4). Direction DOWN: next head (5,4). Then direction DOWN again: next head (6,4), which is an apple. That's another possible path.\n\nSo which apple is easier to reach? Let's check the paths.\n\nFirst, the apple at (2,4):\n\nCurrent head (4,4) → move UP to (3,4) (safe, no collision). Then, move UP again to (2,4) (apple). So in two moves, the snake can eat that apple.\n\nApple at (6,4):\n\nCurrent head (4,4) → move DOWN to (5,4) (safe). Then move DOWN to (6,4) (apple). Also two moves.\n\nWhich path is safer? Let's check possible collisions.\n\nFor the UP path:\n\nAfter moving UP to (3,4), the snake's body would be (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). The next move UP to (2,4) would check if (2,4) is part of the body. (2,4) is the apple, so not part of the body. So that's safe.\n\nFor the DOWN path:\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (5,4), the snake's body would be (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). Then moving DOWN to (6,4) (apple). (6,4) is empty (since row 6 is \"#A  A  #\", column 4 is 'A'). So that's safe.\n\nAnother apple is at (6,1). (6,1) is in row 6, column 1. The current snake's body has (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). So (6,1) is two rows below (4,1). But the head is at (4,4). To reach (6,1), the snake would have to move left and down, but that might take longer and could risk collision.\n\nSo between (2,4) and (6,4), which is better. Let's see the current direction. The snake is moving RIGHT. If we choose UP, the next direction can be UP again (since it's allowed, not reversing). Similarly for DOWN.\n\nBut what about the current body positions. Let's make sure that when moving UP or DOWN, the new positions don't collide with the body.\n\nIf we move UP to (3,4), the new head is (3,4). The body segments are (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So (3,4) is not part of the body, so safe.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (5,4), the new head is (5,4). The body segments are (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). (5,4) is not part of the body, safe.\n\nSo both directions are possible. But which one is better? Let's check if there's any immediate danger. The game is at epoch 24, which is well before 100, so no need to worry about the game ending soon. The snake's goal is to eat as many apples as possible.\n\nAnother thing: when the snake moves, if it's possible to hit itself in the next moves, but in this case, moving UP or DOWN seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the snake's current body structure. The snake's body is along column 1 from row 1 to 4, then right along row 4 to column 4 (head). So the body is like a vertical line (column 1) from (1,1) to (4,1), then a horizontal line (row4) from (4,1) to (4,4). So the snake is shaped like an \"L\" with the vertical part on the left and horizontal part on the bottom.\n\nIf the snake moves UP (to (3,4)), then next move UP to (2,4), which is the apple. Eating that apple would make the snake grow. So the snake's length increases by 1, so the tail isn't removed. So after eating (2,4), the snake's body would have all previous segments plus the new head. So that's a good move.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4), then to (6,4) (apple), which is also good.\n\nWhich of these apples is more accessible? Let's check the positions. (2,4) is in row 2, which is above row 4, and (6,4) is in row 6, which is below. The path to (2,4) would require moving up twice, and (6,4) down twice. Both are possible.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP is better. Let's see the current direction is RIGHT. If we turn UP, the next direction can be UP again, which is allowed. So that's a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if moving RIGHT is a bad idea. If we move RIGHT to (4,5), then next possible directions could be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again. But (4,5) is empty. The next move could be towards (2,4) or (6,4), but it's a bit more steps. So perhaps moving towards the apple now is better.\n\nSo between UP and DOWN, which is better? Let's check if there's any obstacle. For example, after moving UP to (3,4), the next move to (2,4) (apple) is safe. For DOWN, moving to (5,4) then (6,4) (apple) is also safe.\n\nAnother point: the snake's body is along column 1. So if the snake moves UP, the new positions (3,4) and (2,4) are far from the body (which is at column 1). So no collision risk. Similarly, moving DOWN to (5,4) and (6,4) are also far from the body (column 1). So both paths are safe.\n\nIn that case, either direction (UP or DOWN) could be good. But perhaps the apple at (2,4) is closer in terms of current direction. Let's think again. The current head is at (4,4). The apple at (2,4) is two steps up (row 4 → row3 → row2). The apple at (6,4) is two steps down (row4 → row5 → row6). Both are same distance.\n\nBut maybe the snake's current movement is RIGHT. If we turn UP, that's a 90-degree turn. If we turn DOWN, also 90 degrees. Both are allowed.\n\nIn the absence of any better options, perhaps choosing UP would be better. Let's confirm.\n\nSo the answer could be UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#S     #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#SSSH  #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n1. **RIGHT**: The head would move to (4,5). This cell is empty (no wall or self-collision), but there is no apple here. The snake would not grow, and the tail would shrink by one segment. This move avoids immediate danger but does not target an apple.\n\n2. **UP**: The head would move to (3,4). This cell is empty (no collision). From (3,4), the next move (if direction remains UP) would reach (2,4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple would grow the snake and increase the score. This path is safe and directly targets an apple.\n\n3. **DOWN**: The head would move to (5,4). This cell is empty (no collision). From (5,4), the next move (if direction remains DOWN) would reach (6,4), which contains an apple ('A'). This path is also safe and targets an apple but requires moving away from the snake’s current body.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nBoth UP and DOWN can reach apples in two moves, but UP targets the closer apple (2,4) and aligns with a straightforward vertical path. Moving UP is safe and directly progresses toward an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#S   A #\n#S  H  #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the current epoch is 25. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. The snake can't reverse direction, so since it's moving UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is the reverse of UP, which is not allowed).\n\nFirst, let's locate the head. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 2 (since the first row is 0?), let's index rows from 0 to 7. Let's check each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #      # → positions 1-6 are empty (assuming # is at 0 and 7)\nRow 2: #S   A # → positions 1 is S, 5 is A\nRow 3: #S  H  # → positions 1 is S, 4 is H\nRow 4: #SSSS  # → positions 1-4 are S\nRow 5: #      # → empty\nRow 6: #A  A  # → positions 1 and 4 are A\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the head (H) is at row 3, column 4 (assuming rows are 0-based, columns 0-based). Let's confirm: row 3 is \"#S  H  #\", so the characters are [0]#, [1]S, [2] (space), [3] (space), [4]H, [5] (space), [6] (space), [7]#. So H is at (row=3, col=4).\n\nCurrent direction is UP. When the snake moves UP, the head moves to row 2, column 4. Let's check that position. Row 2 is \"#S   A #\", which is [0]#, [1]S, [2] (space), [3] (space), [4] (space), [5]A, [6] (space), [7]#. So row 2, column 4 is a space (empty). So moving UP would take H to (2,4). What's there? Just empty space. So after moving UP, the head is at (2,4), and the body would shift. Since the snake's length is the number of S's plus H. Let's count the S's: row 2 has 1 S (col 1), row 3 has 1 S (col 1), row 4 has 4 S's (cols 1-4). So total S's: 1+1+4=6. H is 1, so current length is 7. When moving, the tail (the last S) would be removed unless an apple is eaten. Since moving UP to (2,4) which is empty, the tail (last S) would be removed. Let's see the tail: the snake's body is a sequence. Since the snake is moving UP, the body is behind the head. The head is at (3,4). The next part of the body is probably (4,4), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). Because row 4 has SSSS (cols 1-4), row 3 has S (col 1), row 2 has S (col 1). So the body segments are (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So when moving UP, the head goes to (2,4), and the new body would be (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). The tail (previously (2,1)) would be removed, becoming empty. So no collision here, but no apple eaten either.\n\nNow, what if the direction is LEFT? The snake is currently moving UP. Turning LEFT is allowed (since LEFT is not the reverse of UP; reverse of UP is DOWN). So moving LEFT would mean the head moves to (3,3). Let's check (3,3): row 3 is \"#S  H  #\", so column 3 is a space (since H is at 4). So (3,3) is empty. So moving LEFT would take H to (3,3). The body would shift, tail removed. No collision, no apple.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: the head moves to (3,5). Let's check row 3, column 5. Row 3 is \"#S  H  #\", so column 5 is a space. So (3,5) is empty. Moving RIGHT here would take H to (3,5), which is safe. No collision, no apple.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's an apple in the path. Let's check all apples. The apples are 'A's. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 2, column 5: A (row 2: #S   A # → column 5 is A)\nRow 6, column 1: A (row 6: #A  A  # → column 1)\nRow 6, column 4: A (row 6, column 4)\n\nSo current apples are at (2,5), (6,1), (6,4).\n\nIf the snake moves UP, the new head position is (2,4). Is there an apple there? (2,4) is a space (row 2: \"#S   A #\", column 4 is space, column 5 is A). So no apple. So moving UP, no apple eaten.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT: (3,5). Let's check (3,5): row 3, column 5 is space. No apple.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT: (3,3) → space. No apple.\n\nWait, maybe the next move after changing direction can reach an apple. Let's think about possible future moves, but the question is to choose the direction for the current move. The goal is to eat apples. Let's see where the apples are. The closest apple is (2,5). Let's see the head's position (3,4). To reach (2,5), the head would need to move UP then RIGHT, or RIGHT then UP. Since current direction is UP, moving UP first would take it to (2,4). Then, from (2,4), possible directions (can't go DOWN, since previous direction is UP). So next direction could be RIGHT (to (2,5)), which is an apple. So if we move UP now, next move could be RIGHT to get the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we turn RIGHT now (direction RIGHT), then the head moves to (3,5). Then next move direction could be UP (since current direction would be RIGHT, can't go LEFT). From (3,5), moving UP would take to (2,5), which is the apple. That's a better path. Let's check:\n\nCurrent head (3,4). Current direction is UP. If we choose direction RIGHT (allowed, since not reverse), then the head moves to (3,5) (row 3, column 5). That's a valid move (no collision). Then, next direction would be RIGHT's possible directions (can't go LEFT). So next move could be UP (since moving RIGHT, next direction can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT). If we move UP from (3,5), we reach (2,5), which is the apple. Then, eating the apple would grow the snake.\n\nSo choosing RIGHT now would allow the next move to reach the apple at (2,5). That's better than moving UP, which would take us to (2,4), then need to move RIGHT to (2,5) (which is the apple) in the next step. Either way, but perhaps moving RIGHT now is better. Let's confirm the possible moves.\n\nAnother apple is at (6,1) and (6,4). Those are in row 6, which is lower. Since the snake is in row 3, moving down might not be good (current direction is UP, moving down is reverse, which is not allowed). So the snake can't go down now. So the possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check for collisions. If the snake moves UP to (2,4), is there any body there? The body parts are (3,4) (old head), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). (2,4) is not a body part, so safe.\n\nIf moving LEFT to (3,3): check if (3,3) is a body part. The body parts are (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). (3,3) is not in the body, so safe.\n\nIf moving RIGHT to (3,5): (3,5) is not a body part, so safe.\n\nSo all three directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe. Now, which direction leads to an apple soonest.\n\nThe apple at (2,5) is the closest. Let's see the distance from current head (3,4) to (2,5): that's 1 up and 1 right. So if we first move RIGHT (to (3,5)), then move UP (to (2,5)), which is the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, move UP (to (2,4)), then move RIGHT (to (2,5)): also two moves. So either path.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT now is better because (3,5) is a safe position, and then next move can get the apple. Let's confirm.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if any direction would lead to immediate collision. All three directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe. So the best choice is to head towards the nearest apple. The nearest apples are (2,5), (6,1), (6,4). (2,5) is closest. So the direction that gets us towards (2,5) is RIGHT (since (3,4) → (3,5) is right, then up to (2,5)). So choosing RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#S   A #\n#S  H  #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 3, column 4). The current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **Moving UP**: The head would move to (row 2, column 4), which is empty. No apple is eaten here, and the snake continues safely but gains no score.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (row 3, column 3), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake remains safe but gains no score.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (row 3, column 5), which is empty. From here, the next move (e.g., UP) can reach the apple at (row 2, column 5), allowing the snake to eat the apple and grow. This direction positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (at (2,5)) in the next step.  \n\nAmong the options, moving RIGHT is optimal as it aligns the snake toward the closest apple, maximizing the chance to increase the score. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is 8x8 with walls around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so columns 1-6 are empty)\nRow 2: #    A # (column 4 has an A)\nRow 3: #S  SH # (columns 1: S, 4: S, 5: H. Wait, let's index columns from 1 to 6 since 0 and 7 are walls. So row 3: columns 1 is S, 4 is S, 5 is H. So positions (3,1), (3,4), (3,5) are S and H.\nRow 4: #SSSS  # (columns 1-4 are S: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4))\nRow 5: #      # (empty)\nRow 6: #A  A  # (columns 1: A, 4: A)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at (3,5) (row 3, column 5). The current direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction, so if current direction is RIGHT, the next direction can't be LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since reversing is not allowed, LEFT is invalid).\n\nNow, let's think about the snake's body positions. The body (S) positions are:\n\nFrom row 3: (3,1), (3,4)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\nSo the body is in a line. Let's list all S positions:\n\n(3,1), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nThe head is at (3,5). The snake is moving RIGHT. So if it continues RIGHT, where would the head go? The next position would be (3,6) (since column 5 +1 is 6). Let's check (3,6). The current row 3 is \"#S  SH #\", so column 6 is a space (since row 3 is \"#S  SH #\", the characters are [0]#, [1]S, [2] , [3] , [4]S, [5]H, [6] , [7]#). So (3,6) is empty. So moving RIGHT would take H to (3,6). Then, since the snake moves, the body parts follow. But wait, when the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous one. So if the snake is length N, the new positions are: new head, then previous head, then previous second, etc., and the tail (last segment) is removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nBut first, need to check if moving in the given direction would cause collision. Let's check possible directions:\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. Possible next directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (can't go LEFT).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Direction RIGHT: The head moves to (3,6). Is that a wall? Column 6 in row 3 is within 1-6 (since walls are 0 and 7), so no wall. Is there a body part there? The body parts are (3,1), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (3,6) is empty. So no collision. Then, after moving, the snake's new head is (3,6). The body would shift. The previous head was (3,5), so that becomes S. Then the rest of the body follows. The tail (the last S) would be removed unless an apple is eaten. Let's check if (3,6) is an apple. Current row 3 has \"SH \" in columns 5 and 6. So (3,6) is a space, no apple. So snake doesn't grow, tail is removed. So that's safe.\n\n2. Direction UP: The head is at (3,5). Moving UP would take it to (2,5). Let's check (2,5). Row 2 is \"#    A #\", columns 1-6: columns 4 is A (since \"#    A #\" is [0]#, [1] , [2] , [3] , [4]A, [5] , [6] , [7]#). So (2,5) is a space (column 5 in row 2 is ' '). So no wall. Check body parts: (2,5) is not in the body positions. So moving UP to (2,5) is safe.\n\n3. Direction DOWN: The head is at (3,5). Moving DOWN would take it to (4,5). Let's check (4,5). Row 4 is \"#SSSS  #\", columns 1-4 are S, columns 5 and 6 are spaces. So (4,5) is a space. So no wall. Check body parts: (4,5) is not in the body positions. So moving DOWN to (4,5) is safe.\n\nNow, we need to check if any of these directions lead to apples. Let's see where the apples are. The apples (A) are in row 2, column 4; row 6, column 1; row 6, column 4.\n\nSo positions of A: (2,4), (6,1), (6,4).\n\nIf the snake moves in a direction that takes the head to an A, it eats the apple, grows, and score increases.\n\nLet's check possible next positions for each direction:\n\n- RIGHT: (3,6) → no A.\n- UP: (2,5) → no A. (2,4) is A, but (2,5) is next to it.\n- DOWN: (4,5) → no A.\n\nWhat about the current movement. Let's think about the snake's path. The snake is moving RIGHT. The head is at (3,5). The body in row 4 is (4,1-4). The body in row 3 is (3,1) and (3,4). So the snake's body is a bit spread out.\n\nAre there any immediate dangers? For example, if the snake turns UP, then next move, where would it go? Let's see. Suppose we choose UP. Then head is at (2,5). Next direction could be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since current direction would be UP, can't go DOWN). But maybe that's not necessary now. The current epoch is 26, which is way before 100, so the game isn't ending soon.\n\nThe goal is to eat apples. So we need to see which direction can lead the snake towards the apples.\n\nThe apples are at (2,4), (6,1), (6,4). Let's see where the head is: (3,5). Let's calculate the distance to each apple.\n\nApple (2,4): row 2, column 4. The head is at (3,5). The distance is (3-2) rows down, (5-4) columns left. So moving UP (to row 2) and LEFT (to column 4) would reach there. But current direction is RIGHT, so can't go LEFT immediately. So if the snake goes UP, then maybe next direction LEFT (since after moving UP, direction is UP, then can turn LEFT (allowed, since UP and LEFT are not opposite)). Let's see.\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (2,5), next direction could be LEFT. Then head would move to (2,4), which is the apple. That would be good. So moving UP now could set up to eat that apple next move.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake continues RIGHT, next position (3,6). Then, direction could be DOWN (since current direction is RIGHT, next can be DOWN). Then head moves to (4,6). Then perhaps towards the apples in row 6.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,5). Then next direction could be DOWN again, moving to (5,5), then (6,5). The apples in row 6 are at (6,1) and (6,4). So (6,5) is a space, but (6,4) is an apple. So from (5,5), moving LEFT to (5,4), then (6,4) (apple).\n\nBut perhaps the closest apple is (2,4). Let's see. If the snake moves UP now, then next direction LEFT. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nCurrent direction after moving UP would be UP. So next possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't go DOWN). So if after moving UP, the direction is UP, then next move could be LEFT (allowed). Let's check the next position after moving UP:\n\nHead at (2,5). If next direction is LEFT, head moves to (2,4), which is the apple. That's perfect. So that's a two-step plan: move UP now, then LEFT next time to eat the apple.\n\nSo moving UP now would be a good choice. Let's check if moving UP is possible (no collision). The head is at (3,5). Moving UP to (2,5). Is (2,5) a wall? No, row 2's column 5 is ' ' (row 2 is \"#    A #\", so columns 1-6: 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' '). So (2,5) is safe, no body part there. So moving UP is safe and sets up to get the apple next move.\n\nOther options: moving RIGHT. Then head is (3,6). Next direction could be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. If direction is UP, head (2,6). Then maybe towards row 2, but (2,4) is the apple. Not sure. Alternatively, moving DOWN. Then head (4,5). Then moving DOWN again to (5,5), then (6,5). Then moving LEFT to (6,4) (apple). That's also possible but takes more steps.\n\nSo the best immediate direction is UP, to get closer to the apple at (2,4). So the answer should be UP.\n\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#S  SH #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head (H) is at (row 3, column 5).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT (snake cannot reverse to LEFT).\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 2, column 4), (row 6, column 1), and (row 6, column 4).\n- **Body Positions**: S occupies (3,1), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\n### Possible Directions (Cannot Reverse to LEFT):\n1. **RIGHT**: Head moves to (3,6). This cell is empty (no apple, no collision). Safe but does not approach an apple.\n2. **UP**: Head moves to (2,5). This cell is empty (no collision). From (2,5), the next move could be LEFT (allowed, as UP and LEFT are not opposite), leading to (2,4) (the apple at row 2, column 4). This sets up a direct path to eat an apple in the next step.\n3. **DOWN**: Head moves to (4,5). This cell is empty (no collision). However, reaching the nearest apple (row 6, column 4) from (4,5) would require more steps compared to the UP path.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is optimal because it positions the snake to reach the apple at (2,4) in the next move, maximizing the chance to eat an apple and grow.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's state.\n\nLet's start by looking at the game board provided. The board is 8x8, with walls as '#'. The snake's head is 'H', body parts are 'S', and apples are 'A'. The current direction is UP, and the epoch is 27, so there's still a lot of epochs left before the 100th.\n\nFirst, I need to map out the positions of each element. Let's list the rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7):\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #      # (columns 1-6 are empty)\nRow 2: #A   H # → Let's index columns 1-6. Column 1 is A, column 5 is H. So positions (2,1) is A, (2,5) is H.\nRow 3: #S  SS # → Let's check columns. Column 1: S, column 4: S, column 5: S. So (3,1), (3,4), (3,5) are S.\nRow 4: #SSSS  # → Columns 1-4 are S. So (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) are S.\nRow 5: #      # (columns 1-6 empty)\nRow 6: #A  A  # → Columns 1 and 4 are A. So (6,1) and (6,4) are A.\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,5) (row 2, column 5). The current direction is UP. Since the snake can't reverse direction, if it's moving UP, the previous direction was not DOWN. The next move direction can be UP (continue), LEFT, or RIGHT (since turning to DOWN would be reversing, which is not allowed).\n\nLet's figure out the snake's body positions to check for possible collisions. The head is at (2,5). The body parts are in row 3: (3,1), (3,4), (3,5); row 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Let's list all body positions (excluding the head):\n\nBody positions: (3,1), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). The head is (2,5). So the snake's length is 1 (head) + 7 (body) = 8. So the snake is 8 units long.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible directions the snake can move. The current direction is UP. So possible next directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because turning DOWN would be the opposite direction (since moving UP, previous direction was UP, so turning DOWN is reverse, which is invalid).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. UP: Moving UP from (2,5) would take the head to (1,5). Let's check if (1,5) is a wall or body. Row 1, column 5: row 1 is \"#      #\", so column 5 is empty (since columns 1-6 are all empty). So (1,5) is safe (not a wall, not a body part). So moving UP would be possible. Then, the new head is (1,5). The body would follow. Since the snake is moving, the tail (the last part) would only stay if the snake ate an apple. Since (1,5) is empty (no apple), the snake's length remains the same, so the tail (which is the last part of the body) would move. Wait, the snake's body is a sequence. The head moves, and each body part follows the previous part. So when moving, the new head is (1,5), and each body part moves to the position of the previous part. The tail (the last body part) would be removed unless the snake ate an apple.\n\nBut first, check if (1,5) is an apple. The apples are at (2,1), (6,1), (6,4). (1,5) is empty, so no apple. So moving UP here would be safe, but no apple eaten.\n\n2. LEFT: Moving LEFT from (2,5) would take the head to (2,4). Let's check (2,4). The current row 2 is \"#A   H #\", which is columns 0: #, 1: A, 2: (space), 3: (space), 4: (space), 5: H, 6: #. So column 4 in row 2 is a space. So (2,4) is empty. Now, check if (2,4) is a body part. The body parts are (3,1), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (2,4) is not in that list, so safe. So moving LEFT would be possible. The new head is (2,4). Check if (2,4) is an apple. No, because apples are at (2,1), (6,1), (6,4). So no apple here.\n\n3. RIGHT: Moving RIGHT from (2,5) would take the head to (2,6). But row 2, column 6 is a wall (since row 2 is \"#A   H #\", which is 8 characters: columns 0 to 7. Column 0: #, 1: A, 2: (space), 3: (space), 4: (space), 5: H, 6: #, 7: #? Wait, wait, each row is 8 characters. Let me recount:\n\nRow 2: \"#A   H #\" → Let's count the characters. The first character is # (column 0), then A (column 1), then three spaces (columns 2,3,4), then H (column 5), then a space (column 6?), wait no. Wait, 8 characters per row. Let's list row 2 as indexes 0-7:\n\nRow 2: [0]# [1]A [2] [3] [4] [5]H [6] [7]#? No, wait, 8 characters. Let's count:\n\n\"#A   H #\" → that's 1 (for #) + 1 (A) + 3 (spaces) + 1 (H) + 1 (space) + 1 (#) → 1+1+3+1+1+1=8? Let's check: \"#A   H #\" is 8 characters. So indexes 0-7:\n\n0: #\n1: A\n2: (space)\n3: (space)\n4: (space)\n5: H\n6: (space)\n7: #\n\nSo moving RIGHT from (2,5) (column 5) would go to column 6. (2,6) is a space (not a wall). So (2,6) is (row 2, column 6). Check if that's a body part. The body parts are (3,1), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (2,6) is not in that list, so safe. So moving RIGHT is possible. (2,6) is empty, so no apple.\n\nWait, but wait, the snake's body is in row 3 and 4. Let's confirm all body positions again.\n\nRow 3: \"#S  SS #\" → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2: (space), 3: (space), 4:S, 5:S, 6: (space), 7: #. So (3,1), (3,4), (3,5) are S.\n\nRow 4: \"#SSSS  #\" → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 5: (space), 6: (space), 7: #. So (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) are S.\n\nSo body positions are (3,1), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). The head is (2,5).\n\nNow, possible directions:\n\nUP: (1,5). Check if (1,5) is a wall? Row 1 is \"#      #\", which is columns 0: #, 1-6: spaces, 7: #. So (1,5) is a space (safe). No apple. So moving UP is safe, but no apple.\n\nLEFT: (2,4). Check (2,4). Row 2, column 4 is a space (since row 2 is \"#A   H #\", columns 2-4 are spaces). (2,4) is not a body part (body parts are in rows 3 and 4). So safe. No apple.\n\nRIGHT: (2,6). (2,6) is a space (row 2, column 6). Not a body part. Safe. No apple.\n\nBut wait, are there any apples that the snake can reach? The apples are at (2,1), (6,1), (6,4).\n\nLet's think about the snake's path. The snake is currently at (2,5), moving UP. The snake's body is in row 3 and 4, so the snake's body is below the head. The snake's length is 8, so the tail is probably at (4,4) (the last S in row 4). Let's imagine the snake's body as a chain. The head is (2,5), then the next body part would be where the head was previously. Since the current direction is UP, the previous move was UP. So before the current position, the head was at (3,5), which is now a body part (since row 3, column 5 is S). Then the next part would be (4,5), but (4,5) is a space. Wait, maybe the snake's body is arranged such that each part follows the previous. Let's reconstruct the snake's path.\n\nCurrent head is (2,5). The direction is UP, so the previous position of the head was (3,5) (since moving UP from (3,5) to (2,5)). So (3,5) is now a body part (S). Then, before that, the head was at (4,5), but (4,5) is a space in row 4 (row 4 is \"#SSSS  #\", column 5 is space). So perhaps the snake's body is:\n\nHead (H) at (2,5)\n\nBody segments: (3,5) [since that's where the head was before moving up], then (3,4), (3,1), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). Wait, maybe the body is a continuous chain. Let's see:\n\nRow 3 has S at (3,1), (3,4), (3,5). Row 4 has S at (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nIf the snake is moving up, the head is (2,5). The body behind the head is (3,5) (since that's the previous head position). Then (3,4) (the next part), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). That makes a continuous path: (2,5) → (3,5) → (3,4) → (4,4) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (4,1) → (3,1). That's 8 parts (head + 7 body parts), which matches the length. So the body is arranged in that chain.\n\nSo the snake's body is: (2,5) [H], (3,5) [S], (3,4) [S], (4,4) [S], (4,3) [S], (4,2) [S], (4,1) [S], (3,1) [S]. So the tail is at (3,1).\n\nNow, when the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body part follows the previous one. The tail (3,1) would only stay if the snake eats an apple. Otherwise, the tail moves forward (i.e., the tail is removed, as the snake doesn't grow).\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's see where the apples are. Apples are at (2,1), (6,1), (6,4).\n\nLet's check the positions:\n\nApple at (2,1): row 2, column 1. The head is at (2,5). To reach (2,1), the snake would need to move left multiple times. Let's see the path from (2,5) to (2,1). The current row 2, columns 1-5: (2,1) is A, (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) are spaces. So if the snake moves left, left, left, left from (2,5), it would reach (2,1). But need to check if the path is clear of body parts.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves LEFT to (2,4). Then next move LEFT to (2,3). Then LEFT to (2,2). Then LEFT to (2,1). (2,1) is the apple. So that's a possible path. Let's check if those positions are safe.\n\n(2,4): safe (no body). (2,3): safe. (2,2): safe. (2,1): apple. So moving left four times would reach the apple.\n\nBut what's the immediate next move? The current direction is UP, so the next direction can be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see which direction gets the snake closer to an apple.\n\nThe apples are at (2,1), (6,1), (6,4). Let's calculate the distance from the head (2,5) to each apple.\n\nApple (2,1): same row (row 2), columns 5 to 1: distance 4 (columns difference 4). So moving left would reduce this distance.\n\nApple (6,1): row 6, column 1. Head is (2,5). So row difference is 4 (down), column difference 4 (left). Distance is 8 (Manhattan distance).\n\nApple (6,4): row 6, column 4. Head is (2,5). Row difference 4 (down), column difference 1 (left). Manhattan distance 5.\n\nSo the closest apple is (2,1) at distance 4. So moving left would be the way to go.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT now (from (2,5) to (2,4)), then the next direction could be LEFT again (since the current direction would then be LEFT, and can't reverse to RIGHT). Then next move LEFT to (2,3), then LEFT to (2,2), then LEFT to (2,1) (the apple). That would allow the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score.\n\nBut we need to check if moving LEFT now is possible. Let's confirm (2,4) is safe. (2,4) is a space, and not part of the body. So yes, moving LEFT is safe.\n\nWhat if the snake moves UP? Then it would go to (1,5). Then next direction could be UP (but row 0 is a wall, so (0,5) is a wall, which would be a collision. So moving UP again next time would hit the wall. So that's dangerous. So moving UP might not be a good idea.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, to (2,6), which is a space. Then next direction could be RIGHT again, but (2,7) is a wall (row 2, column 7 is #). So moving RIGHT again would hit the wall, which is bad. So moving RIGHT is not helpful.\n\nSo the best direction is LEFT, to start moving towards the closest apple at (2,1).\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#A   H #\n#S  SS #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 2, column 5), moving in the UP direction. The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible next directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving to (row 1, column 5) (empty space, no collision). No apple here.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving to (row 2, column 4) (empty space, no collision). No apple here, but this direction brings the snake closer to the nearest apple at (row 2, column 1).  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (row 2, column 6) (empty space, no collision). No apple here, and further from apples.  \n\nThe closest apple is at (row 2, column 1). Moving LEFT starts the snake toward this apple, which is the optimal path to maximize score. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so positions (1,1) to (1,6) are empty)\nRow 2: #A  HS # (columns 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: 'S', 6: ' '; so (2,1)=A, (2,4)=H (head), (2,5)=S (body))\nRow 3: #   SS # (columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' '; (3,4)=S, (3,5)=S)\nRow 4: #SSSS  # (columns 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' '; (4,1) to (4,4) are S)\nRow 5: #      # (all empty between 1-6)\nRow 6: #A  A  # (columns 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' '; (6,1)=A, (6,4)=A)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. The head (H) is at (2,4) (row 2, column 4). Since direction is LEFT, the next move would be to (2,3) if we don't change direction. But we can choose to change direction to UP, DOWN, or keep LEFT (since reversing is not allowed; current is LEFT, so can't go RIGHT).\n\nFirst, let's check the current position of the snake's body to avoid collision. The body (S) positions are:\n\nFrom row 2, column 5: (2,5)\nRow 3, columns 4 and 5: (3,4), (3,5)\nRow 4, columns 1-4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSo the snake's body is in those positions. The head is at (2,4). Let's think about possible directions:\n\nPossible directions are LEFT (current), UP, DOWN (can't go RIGHT because that's reversing direction).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT (current direction): The head moves from (2,4) to (2,3). What's at (2,3)? Looking at row 2: \"#A  HS #\", so column 3 is ' ' (empty). So the new head position is (2,3). Then, the body segments will follow. Since the snake's length depends on how many apples it's eaten. Let's see: initial length is 1. Each apple eaten increases length by 1. The current snake's body has several S's. Let's count the current body length. The head is H, then the body S's. Let's count the S's:\n\nRow 2, column 5: 1 S\nRow 3, columns 4 and 5: 2 S's (total 3)\nRow4, columns 1-4: 4 S's (total 7). So total body length is 7, so the snake's total length is 8 (head + 7 body). That means the snake has eaten 7 apples (since initial length is 1, each apple adds 1, so 1 + 7 apples = 8 length).\n\nSo when moving, the snake's body will shift. The new head is (2,3). The previous head (2,4) becomes S. Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous one. The tail (the last S) will be removed unless the snake just ate an apple (which would keep the tail). But in this case, if the head moves to (2,3), which is empty (no apple), then the tail (the last S) is removed. Let's check if (2,3) is an apple. Row 2, column 3 is ' ', so no apple. So the tail (the last S) would be removed. Let's find the tail. The snake's body is a chain. Let's trace the snake's path. The head is at (2,4). The next body segment is (2,5) (since direction was LEFT, the previous move would have the head moving left, so the body follows. Let's reconstruct the snake's path.\n\nAssuming the snake's movement history: since current direction is LEFT, the previous move was LEFT. Let's see:\n\nIf the head was at (2,5) moving LEFT, then it would move to (2,4) (current head position). Then the body would be (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). Because each move, the body follows. So the body segments are in order: (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). So the tail is at (4,1). When moving LEFT to (2,3), the new body would be (2,4) (old head), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). The tail (4,1) is removed. So the new positions would be:\n\nHead: (2,3)\nBody: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nNow, check for collision. The new head (2,3) is in row 2, column 3. The walls are at columns 0 and 7 (since the grid is 0-7). So (2,3) is within the board (columns 1-6 are inside). So no wall collision. Now check if (2,3) is part of the body. The body positions after moving would be (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). So (2,3) is not in the body, so no collision. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\n2. UP direction: Current direction is LEFT. Turning UP is allowed (not reversing). The head is at (2,4). Moving UP would take it to (1,4). Let's check (1,4): row 1 is \"#      #\", so column 4 is ' ', empty. So new head is (1,4). Check for collision: (1,4) is within the board (row 1 is between 0 and 7, row 0 is a wall, row 1 is safe). Check if (1,4) is body. The current body positions (before moving) are (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). So (1,4) is not in the body. After moving, the body would shift: old head (2,4) becomes S, then (2,5), (3,5), etc. The new body positions would be (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). The new head (1,4) is not in the body. So moving UP is safe.\n\n3. DOWN direction: Current direction is LEFT. Turning DOWN is allowed. The head (2,4) moving DOWN would go to (3,4). Let's check (3,4). Looking at row 3: \"#   SS #\", column 4 is 'S'. Oh, (3,4) is part of the current body. So if the head moves down to (3,4), that's a collision with the body. So moving DOWN would cause the game to end. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT and UP. Now, we need to choose which direction to take to eat apples and avoid future collisions. Let's check where the apples are. Apples are at (2,1), (6,1), (6,4).\n\nCurrent head is at (2,4). Let's see the positions:\n\nIf moving LEFT to (2,3), next step possible moves. Let's think about the path. The snake is moving left. From (2,3), next move could be LEFT again (to (2,2)), which is empty. (2,2) is in row 2, column 2: row 2 is \"#A  HS #\", column 2 is ' ' (since row 2: columns 0 is '#', 1 is 'A', 2 is ' ', 3 is ' ', 4 is 'H', 5 is 'S', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'). So (2,2) is empty. Then (2,1) is 'A' (apple). So if the snake continues moving left, next step (2,2) then (2,1), which is an apple. That would be good. So moving LEFT now would allow the snake to reach (2,1) in two steps (current move to (2,3), then next move to (2,2), then (2,1) which is an apple).\n\nIf moving UP to (1,4), then the next direction options would be UP, LEFT, or DOWN (since current direction would be UP, can't reverse to DOWN). Let's see where (1,4) is. Then, moving UP again would take to (0,4), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). So that's bad. So if direction is UP, next move can't be UP. So possible directions after UP would be LEFT (current direction after first move is UP, so next directions can be UP (invalid, wall), LEFT, or DOWN (but DOWN would be reversing if current is UP? Wait, the direction after moving UP would be UP, so the next direction can't be DOWN (reverse). So next possible directions are UP (invalid, wall), LEFT, or RIGHT (reverse of UP? No, reverse is only when the direction is opposite. UP's reverse is DOWN, LEFT's reverse is RIGHT. So if current direction is UP, next direction can't be DOWN. So after moving UP to (1,4), possible directions are UP (wall), LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT from (1,4) would take to (1,3). Then (1,3) is empty, then (1,2), (1,1), which is (1,1) in row 1: \"#      #\", so (1,1) is empty, (1,0) is wall. So that path doesn't lead to apples quickly. The apples are at (2,1), (6,1), (6,4). So moving UP might not lead to an apple soon.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now allows the snake to approach (2,1) which is an apple. That's a good target. So the best choice is to continue moving LEFT, as it leads towards an apple and avoids collision.\n\nSo the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#      #\n#A  HS #\n#   SS #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (2,4). Body (S) segments are at (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT (snake is moving left).\n- **Apples**: Located at (2,1), (6,1), (6,4).\n- **Collision Rules**: The snake loses if it hits walls (edge '#') or its own body (S).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT (Current Direction)**:  \n   The head moves from (2,4) to (2,3).  \n   - (2,3) is empty (no collision with walls or body).  \n   - After moving, the new head is (2,3), and the body shifts (old head (2,4) becomes S, tail (4,1) is removed).  \n   - This path leads toward (2,1) (an apple) in subsequent moves, making it a safe and beneficial direction.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   The head moves from (2,4) to (1,4).  \n   - (1,4) is empty (no collision).  \n   - However, moving UP leads to open space with no immediate apples, and further UP would hit the top wall (row 0), limiting future options.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   The head moves from (2,4) to (3,4).  \n   - (3,4) is occupied by the snake’s body (S), causing an immediate collision. This direction is invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is safe, avoids collisions, and positions the snake to reach an apple (2,1) in subsequent moves. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#A HSS #\n#   SS #\n# SSS  #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 29. The snake's head is 'H', and the body parts are 'S'. The snake is moving LEFT, which means the next move would be to the left of the current head position. Let's find where the head is right now.\n\nLooking at the second row (since rows are 0-based, maybe?), let's list the rows:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #      # (so columns 1-6 are empty)\nRow 2: #A HSS # → Let's parse this. Columns 0 is '#', column 1 is 'A', column 2 is ' ', column 3 is 'H', column 4 is 'S', column 5 is 'S', column 6 is ' ', column 7 is '#'\nSo H is at (2,3) (row 2, column 3)\nRow 3: #   SS # → columns 0 is '#', 1-3 are ' ', 4 and 5 are 'S', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'\nRow 4: # SSS  # → column 1 is 'S', 2 is 'S', 3 is 'S', 4-6 are ' ', 0 and 7 are '#'\nRow 5: #      # → empty\nRow 6: #A  A  # → column 1 is 'A', 4 is 'A', others are ' ' or '#'\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. So the next position the head would move to is (2,3-1) = (2,2) (since moving left decreases the column index by 1). Let's check what's in (2,2). Looking at row 2, column 2: it's a space ' ', so that's safe. But wait, maybe I should check if that's a body part or a wall. (2,2) is within the board (columns 0-7, rows 0-7). The walls are only on the edges (row 0 and 7, column 0 and 7). So (2,2) is not a wall. Now, is there a body part there? The current body parts are S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 2: columns 4,5 → (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3: columns 4,5 → (3,4), (3,5)\nRow 4: columns 1,2,3 → (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nSo (2,2) is empty. So if we move LEFT, the head goes to (2,2). Then, since the snake moves, the body follows. The current length of the snake: let's count the S's and H. H is 1, S's: row 2 has 2, row 3 has 2, row 4 has 3. Total S's: 2+2+3=7. So total length is 1 (H) +7 (S) =8. So when moving, the tail (the last S) will move forward. But if the snake doesn't eat an apple, the tail is removed. Wait, the example given earlier: when the snake moves, if it eats an apple, it grows (so tail stays), else the tail moves (so the tail is removed, and the new head is added). So in the example, moving down (original head at row 3, column 3), moving down to row 4, column 3 (which was A), so they ate the apple. Then the new head is there, and the body parts follow, so the previous positions are filled with S, and the tail (the last part) is not removed. So the length increases by 1.\n\nIn our current case, moving LEFT to (2,2). What's in (2,2)? It's a space. So no apple eaten. So the snake's head moves to (2,2), and the tail (the last S) is removed. Let's see the current body. The snake's body is a sequence. The head is at (2,3), then the next part is (2,4), then (2,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) — because the body is connected. Let's think about the snake's body path. The snake is moving LEFT, so the direction is LEFT. The previous movement must have been such that the body follows. So the head is (2,3), moving left. The body segments are in the direction the head was moving before. So the body after H is (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). So the tail is at (4,1). So when moving left, the new head is (2,2), and the tail (4,1) is removed. So the new body positions would be (2,3) (now S), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,3), (4,2). So the new body is those positions, and the new head is (2,2). So that's safe.\n\nBut the player can choose to change direction, but cannot reverse. The current direction is LEFT. Reversing would be RIGHT. So allowed directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (since reversing is not allowed). Wait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So current direction is LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since RIGHT is the reverse). So the player can choose to continue moving LEFT, or turn UP or DOWN.\n\nOur goal is to eat apples and avoid collision. Let's check where the apples are. The apples are at (2,1) (row 2, column 1: in row 2, the first character after # is A at column 1), and row 6, column 1 and row 6, column 4. So apples at (2,1), (6,1), (6,4).\n\nCurrent head is (2,3). Let's see possible moves:\n\nOption 1: Continue LEFT. Next head position (2,2). Then, the next move (epoch 30) would have direction LEFT again (if we don't change). Then, next head position (2,1) which is an apple. Oh! Because (2,1) is A. So if we move LEFT now, then in the next step (epoch 30), moving LEFT again would take us to (2,1), which is an apple. That's a good plan. Let's verify:\n\nCurrent move (epoch 29): direction LEFT. Head moves from (2,3) to (2,2). No apple here (since (2,2) is ' '), so the snake moves, tail is removed. Then, epoch 30: direction LEFT again (since we can keep moving in the same direction). Head moves from (2,2) to (2,1), which is 'A'. So we eat the apple, score increases, and the snake grows. That's a good path.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that (2,2) is safe. Are there any body parts there? No, as we checked earlier. So moving LEFT now is safe, and then next move to (2,1) which is an apple.\n\nWhat if we choose UP or DOWN? Let's check.\n\nOption 2: Turn UP. Current direction is LEFT. Turning UP is allowed (not reverse). The head is at (2,3). Moving UP would take it to (1,3). Let's check (1,3): row 1 is '#      #', so column 3 is ' ', so safe. Then, the next direction would be UP (if we keep moving up). But what's around (1,3)? The walls are at row 0, so moving up again would take to (0,3), which is a wall (row 0 is all #). So that's a collision. So if we turn UP now, next move (epoch 30) direction UP would hit a wall. So that's bad.\n\nOption 3: Turn DOWN. Current direction is LEFT. Turning DOWN is allowed. The head (2,3) moves down to (3,3). Let's check (3,3): row 3 is '#   SS #', so column 3 is ' ' (since columns 4 and 5 are S). So (3,3) is safe. Then, the next direction could be DOWN again. Then, moving down to (4,3). Row 4 is '# SSS  #', column 3 is 'S' (since (4,3) is part of the body). So (4,3) is a body part. So if we move DOWN now (epoch 29) to (3,3), then in epoch 30, moving DOWN again to (4,3) would collide with the body, which ends the game. That's bad.\n\nSo moving DOWN now would lead to a collision in the next step.\n\nSo the best option is to continue moving LEFT. Because that allows us to reach the apple at (2,1) in the next step. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head (2,3) → move LEFT to (2,2) (epoch 29). Then, direction remains LEFT (since we can choose to keep direction). Epoch 30: move LEFT to (2,1) (which is A). Eat the apple, grow, score increases. That's safe and beneficial.\n\nOther options (UP or DOWN) lead to possible collisions. So the correct direction is LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#A HSS #\n#   SS #\n# SSS  #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. The snake's head is at position (row 2, column 3). The goal is to choose a direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) that avoids collisions with walls or the snake's body and maximizes apple consumption. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Current Direction Restriction**: The snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT → RIGHT is invalid). Valid directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n2. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (row 2, column 1), (row 6, column 1), and (row 6, column 4).\n3. **Collision Risks**:\n   - **UP**: Moving UP from (2,3) leads to (1,3) (safe), but a subsequent UP move would hit the top wall (row 0), causing a collision.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (2,3) leads to (3,3) (safe), but a subsequent DOWN move would reach (4,3), which is occupied by the snake's body (S), causing a collision.\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (2,3) leads to (2,2) (safe, no walls or body). A subsequent LEFT move from (2,2) would reach (2,1), which contains an apple (A), allowing the snake to eat it and grow safely.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT avoids immediate collisions and positions the snake to eat an apple in the next epoch.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. The game board is 8x8 with walls around. The current direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 30, which is well before the 100th epoch, so the game is still ongoing.\n\nFirst, let's parse the game board. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #      # (so positions 1-6 are empty)\nRow 2: #AHSSS # → So positions 1 is A, 2 is H (head), 3 is S, 4 is S, 5 is S, 6 is space, 7 is #\nRow 3: #   SS # → positions 3 is S, 4 is S, others are space (since index 1 is #, 2 is space, 3 S, 4 S, 5 space, 6 space, 7 #)\nRow 4: #  SS  # → positions 2 S, 3 S, others space\nRow 5: #      # (all spaces)\nRow 6: #A  A  # → positions 1 A, 4 A, others space\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the snake's head is at row 2, column 2 (since row 2 is index 2, and the characters are at positions 1: A, 2: H). Let's confirm coordinates. Let's assume rows are 0 (top) to 7 (bottom), columns 0 (left) to 7 (right). Each row is 8 characters. So row 2 (third row) is index 2. The characters in row 2 are:\n\nindex 0: # (wall)\nindex 1: A (apple)\nindex 2: H (head)\nindex 3: S (body)\nindex 4: S (body)\nindex 5: S (body)\nindex 6:  (space)\nindex 7: # (wall)\n\nSo head position (H) is (row=2, column=2). The current direction is LEFT. Since the snake is moving LEFT, the next position the head would move to is (row=2, column=1) (since moving left decreases the column by 1). Let's check what's at (2,1): it's an A (apple). Oh, that's good! So if the snake continues moving LEFT (current direction), it will eat the apple at (2,1). \n\nBut wait, the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is LEFT. So possible directions the player can choose are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing would be RIGHT, which is not allowed). Because the snake can't reverse, if current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLet's check the possible moves:\n\n1. If direction is LEFT (current direction):\n   - New head position is (2,1), which is A (apple). So the snake eats the apple, grows in length. The score increases by 1. Then, the new head is at (2,1), and the body segments follow. Since the snake was moving left, the previous head was at (2,2), which becomes S (body). The rest of the body (positions (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)) will shift. The new body would be (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), and the new head at (2,1). So no collision here, since (2,1) is an apple (not a wall or body). So this is a safe move, and gains a point.\n\n2. If direction is UP:\n   - The snake is moving LEFT, so changing direction to UP. Let's see where the new head would be. Moving UP from (2,2) would take the head to (1,2). Let's check row 1: #      # → columns 1-6 are empty. So (1,2) is empty (space). Now, check if that position is a wall or body. The walls are at columns 0 and 7. (1,2) is within the board (row 1, column 2). The body of the snake: the current body is in row 2 (columns 3,4,5), row 3 (columns 3,4), row 4 (columns 2,3). So (1,2) is not part of the body. So moving UP would be safe. But there's no apple there. So the snake moves to (1,2), and the tail would move (since the snake didn't eat an apple, the length remains the same). So the body segments shift: the previous head (2,2) becomes S, then the next body parts. But no collision here. But no apple eaten.\n\n3. If direction is DOWN:\n   - Moving DOWN from (2,2) would take the head to (3,2). Let's check row 3: #   SS #. Columns 3 and 4 are S. So (3,2) is column 2 in row 3. Row 3's columns: 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: S, 4: S, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So (3,2) is space. Check if that's part of the body. The current body is (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3). So (3,2) is not part of the body. So moving DOWN is safe. But again, no apple there.\n\nSo the best option is to continue moving LEFT, which allows the snake to eat the apple at (2,1). Because that's an immediate apple, which increases the score and allows the snake to grow. Let's confirm that (2,1) is indeed an apple. Looking at row 2, index 1: 'A'. Yes. So moving LEFT here is safe and beneficial.\n\nAre there any possible collisions if moving LEFT? The new head is (2,1). Let's check if that's a wall. The walls are at column 0 (for all rows). (2,1) is column 1, which is within the board (columns 1-6 are inside). So no wall collision. The body is currently at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3). So (2,1) is not part of the body. So safe.\n\nSo the best direction is LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#AHSSS #\n#   SS #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (row=2, column=2), moving LEFT. The next position when moving LEFT is (row=2, column=1), which contains an apple ('A'). Moving LEFT is valid (no reversal of direction) and safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body). Eating the apple will increase the score and allow the snake to grow. Other directions (UP, DOWN) do not lead to apples and are less beneficial. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. The board is 8x8 with walls around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. The current direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 31, which is well before 100, so the game isn't ending yet.\n\nLet me start by mapping out the current positions. Let's list the rows from top to bottom (rows 0 to 7) and columns 0 to 7 (left to right).\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #      # → columns 1-6 are empty (so (1,1) to (1,6) are empty)\nRow 2: #HSSSS # → Let's parse this. The row starts with #, then H at (2,1), followed by S at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), then a space at (2,6), then #. So H is at (2,1), body S's at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\nRow 3: #   SS # → # at 0, then spaces (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), then S at (3,4), (3,5), then space (3,6), #. So S's at (3,4), (3,5).\nRow 4: #  SS  # → # at 0, spaces (4,1), (4,2), then S at (4,3), (4,4), spaces (4,5), (4,6), #. So S's at (4,3), (4,4).\nRow 5: #  A   # → # at 0, spaces (5,1), (5,2), A at (5,3), spaces (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), #. So A at (5,3).\nRow 6: #A  A  # → # at 0, A at (6,1), spaces (6,2), (6,3), A at (6,4), spaces (6,5), (6,6), #. So A's at (6,1), (6,4).\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,1). Current direction is LEFT. So the next move, if we continue LEFT, the head would move to (2,0), which is a wall (since row 2, column 0 is #). That's a collision with the wall, which would end the game. So moving LEFT is bad.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is LEFT, reversing would be RIGHT (since LEFT and RIGHT are opposites). So the snake can't choose RIGHT as the next direction. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT (but LEFT leads to wall).\n\nSo possible directions to choose are UP or DOWN. Let's check where each direction would take the head.\n\nCurrent head position: (2,1). Let's note the coordinates: (row, column). Moving directions:\n\n- UP: (row-1, column). So (2-1,1) = (1,1). What's in (1,1)? Looking at row 1: #      # → (1,1) is empty (no S, no wall, no A). So moving UP would take the head to (1,1). Then, the snake's body would follow. Let's check if (1,1) is part of the snake's body. The body is in row 2 (columns 2-5), row 3 (4-5), row 4 (3-4). (1,1) is not part of the body, so no collision.\n\n- DOWN: (row+1, column). So (2+1,1) = (3,1). What's in (3,1)? Row 3 is #   SS #. Column 1 of row 3 is a space (since row 3: columns 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is space, 3 is space, 4 is S, 5 is S, 6 is space, 7 is #). So (3,1) is empty. Check if (3,1) is part of the body. The body's positions are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4). (3,1) is not in those, so moving DOWN to (3,1) is safe.\n\nNow, let's check if either direction leads to an apple. The apples are at (5,3), (6,1), (6,4).\n\nIf moving UP to (1,1): (1,1) is empty, no apple. So the snake would move there, and the tail would move (since length is current length. Let's check the snake's current length. The head is H, and the body S's. Let's count S's:\n\nRow 2: HSSSS → 4 S's (columns 2-5)\nRow 3:   SS → 2 S's (columns 4-5)\nRow 4:  SS → 2 S's (columns 3-4)\nTotal S's: 4+2+2=8. So snake length is 1 (head) + 8 (body) = 9. When moving, if not eating an apple, the tail (last S) would be removed, and the new head is added. So after moving UP, the new head is (1,1), and the body shifts. The previous head (2,1) becomes S, and the last S (the one at the end of the tail) is removed.\n\nIf moving DOWN to (3,1): (3,1) is empty. So same as UP, no apple eaten. The snake would just move there, body shifts.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the apple positions. Let's recheck:\n\nRow 5: #  A   # → (5,3) is A.\nRow 6: #A  A  # → (6,1) is A, (6,4) is A. Correct.\n\nSo neither UP nor DOWN direction leads directly to an apple. But perhaps we need to think about the path to the apples. Let's see where the apples are. The closest apples are (6,1) (row 6, column 1) and (5,3) (row 5, column 3), (6,4) (row 6, column 4).\n\nCurrent head is at (2,1). Let's think about possible paths. Let's check if moving UP is possible. The head is at (2,1). Moving UP to (1,1). Then, the next possible directions. Let's say after moving UP, the direction could be UP again (if possible), but need to avoid walls and body.\n\nRow 1 is all empty except walls. So (1,1) is safe. Then, if we go UP again, the head would be (0,1), which is a wall (row 0 is all #). So can't go UP again. So after moving UP once, next directions could be LEFT (but (1,0) is wall), RIGHT (to (1,2)), or DOWN (back towards (2,1), but that's allowed as long as it's not reversing. Current direction after moving UP would be UP, so reversing would be DOWN. So if current direction is UP, next direction can't be DOWN. So after moving UP, the next possible directions are LEFT (invalid, wall), RIGHT (to (1,2)), or UP (invalid, wall). So moving UP may not be the best path.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN. Current head (2,1) → moving DOWN to (3,1). Then, next possible directions. The current direction would be DOWN (since we changed direction from LEFT to DOWN, which is allowed as it's not reversing). Then, next moves could be DOWN again (to (4,1)), LEFT (to (3,0) which is wall), RIGHT (to (3,2)), or UP (reverse of DOWN, which is not allowed). Let's check (3,1) → (4,1) (row 4, column 1). Row 4 is #  SS  #. Column 1 of row 4 is a space (since row 4: columns 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is space, 3 is S, 4 is S, 5 is space, 6 is space, 7 is #). So (4,1) is empty. Then moving DOWN again to (4,1) is safe. Then, (5,1) (row 5, column 1) which is in row 5: #  A   #. Column 1 of row 5 is a space. (5,1) is empty. Then (6,1) which is an apple (row 6, column 1). So moving DOWN from (2,1) → (3,1) → (4,1) → (5,1) → (6,1) would reach the apple at (6,1). That's a possible path. So moving DOWN now would start that path towards the apple.\n\nIf we move UP, the head goes to (1,1), which is in row 1. Then, possible directions: RIGHT (since UP and DOWN are possible, but UP is wall). So moving RIGHT from (1,1) to (1,2), then RIGHT to (1,3), etc. But that's moving away from the apples which are in rows 5 and 6. So perhaps moving DOWN is better to get towards the apples in the lower rows.\n\nAlso, need to check if moving DOWN would cause collision with the body. The body's current positions: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4). The new head position after moving DOWN is (3,1). Is (3,1) in any of the body positions? The body positions are (2,2-5), (3,4-5), (4,3-4). (3,1) is not in those, so no collision. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nWhat about moving UP? (1,1) is not part of the body. So that's safe. So both directions are safe, but which is better for reaching apples.\n\nThe apples are in row 5 and 6, so moving down (towards row 6) would get the snake closer. So the best direction is DOWN.\n\n\n########\n#      #\n#HSSSS #\n#   SS #\n#  SS  #\n#  A   #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current state:\n\n1. **Current Head Position**: The snake's head 'H' is at (row 2, column 1).  \n2. **Current Direction**: LEFT. Moving LEFT would take the head to (2, 0), which is a wall (collision), so LEFT is invalid.  \n3. **Reversal Rule**: The snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT → RIGHT is forbidden), so RIGHT is invalid.  \n4. **Valid Directions**: Only UP or DOWN are possible.  \n\n### Analysis of UP:  \nMoving UP would take the head to (1, 1). This cell is empty (no walls or body segments), so it’s safe. However, this moves the snake upward, away from the apples located in rows 5 and 6.  \n\n### Analysis of DOWN:  \nMoving DOWN would take the head to (3, 1). This cell is empty (no walls or body segments), so it’s safe. This direction moves the snake downward, toward the apples in rows 5 and 6 (e.g., the apple at (6, 1) is directly below in row 6).  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nDOWN is the safest and most strategic direction, as it avoids collision and guides the snake toward apples.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' walls. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so positions (1,1) to (1,6) are empty)\nRow 2: #SSSSS # → So positions (2,1) to (2,5) are 'S' (snake body), (2,6) is empty\nRow 3: #H  SS # → (3,1) is 'H' (head), (3,4) and (3,5) are 'S'\nRow 4: #   S  # → (4,4) is 'S'\nRow 5: #  A   # → (5,3) is 'A' (apple)\nRow 6: #A  A  # → (6,1) is 'A', (6,4) is 'A'\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. Let's remember that the snake can't reverse direction, so if current direction is DOWN, the next direction can't be UP. Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (but since direction input is what the player gives, maybe the current direction is DOWN, but the player can choose to turn, but can't reverse).\n\nThe snake's body positions need to be tracked. Let's list all the 'S' and 'H' positions:\n\nHead (H) is at (3,1) (row 3, column 1, assuming rows start at 0). The body (S) positions:\n\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3: (3,4), (3,5)\nRow 4: (4,4)\n\nSo the snake's body is a bit complex. Let's try to figure out the snake's path. Since the snake moves in the current direction (DOWN) each epoch, and the head moves first. Let's think about how the snake's body moves. Normally, when the snake moves, the head moves to the next cell in the direction, and each body segment follows the previous one. So, the positions of the body are the previous positions of the head and the following segments.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider where the head will move next based on the direction input, and check for collisions.\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, so the next move (if the direction remains DOWN) would be the head moving from (3,1) down to (4,1). Let's check what's at (4,1). The row 4 is \"#   S  #\", which translates to columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (4,1) is empty (a space). So moving DOWN would take the head to (4,1), which is safe (no wall, no body). But maybe there's an apple there? Let's check. The apples are at (5,3), (6,1), (6,4). (4,1) is empty, so no apple. So the snake would move, and the body would shift: the new head is (4,1), and the previous head (3,1) becomes part of the body, and the last segment of the body (the tail) would be removed unless the snake ate an apple. Since there's no apple here, the tail would move, so the body length remains the same.\n\nBut wait, the player can choose to change direction (as long as it's not the reverse). The current direction is DOWN, so possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since UP is the reverse). Let's consider each possible direction:\n\n1. Direction DOWN: head moves to (4,1). Check if (4,1) is wall? No, it's within the board (rows 0-7, columns 0-7). Is (4,1) part of the body? The current body positions are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,4). (4,1) is not in those positions, so safe. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\n2. Direction LEFT: the snake would turn left. The head is at (3,1). Moving LEFT would take it to (3,0). But (3,0) is a wall (since row 3 starts with '#'), so that's a collision. So LEFT is invalid, game over.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT: the head moves to (3,2). Let's check (3,2). The row 3 is \"#H  SS #\", so columns 0: '#', 1: 'H', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (3,2) is empty. Is (3,2) part of the body? Current body positions don't include (3,2), so safe. So moving RIGHT is possible.\n\n4. Direction UP: reverse of current direction (DOWN), which is not allowed. So UP is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are DOWN and RIGHT. Now, we need to see which direction leads to eating an apple or avoiding future collisions.\n\nThe apples are at (5,3), (6,1), (6,4). Let's see where the head would go next in each possible direction:\n\nIf we choose DOWN: head moves to (4,1). Then next step, the direction could be changed again. Let's see if (4,1) is near any apples. The next position after (4,1) (if moving DOWN again) would be (5,1). Let's check row 5: \"#  A   #\", so (5,1) is ' ', (5,3) is 'A'. So (5,1) is empty. (5,3) is an apple, but how to reach it. Alternatively, if after moving DOWN to (4,1), next direction could be RIGHT towards (4,2), (4,3), etc.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: head moves to (3,2). Then next possible directions (since current direction would be RIGHT now, so can't go LEFT). Let's see (3,2) is safe, then next move could be RIGHT again to (3,3), which is also empty (row 3, column 3 is ' '). Then maybe towards (3,4), but (3,4) is part of the body (current S in row 3, column 4). So (3,4) is body, so moving into (3,4) would cause collision. So (3,3) is safe, then (3,4) is body. So moving RIGHT might lead towards the body.\n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (3,2), the next direction could be DOWN, moving to (4,2). Let's check (4,2): row 4 is \"#   S  #\", column 2 is ' ', so (4,2) is empty. Then (4,2) is safe. Then maybe towards (5,2), (5,3) which is an apple. (5,3) is the apple. So if the snake moves RIGHT then DOWN, it could reach (5,3) which is an apple.\n\nBut let's check the current apple positions. The apples are at (5,3), (6,1), (6,4). Let's see which is closest.\n\nCurrent head is at (3,1). The apple at (6,1) is in column 1, row 6. So if the snake continues moving DOWN, from (3,1) → (4,1) → (5,1) → (6,1). That's three moves. (6,1) is an apple. So if the snake moves DOWN three times, it will reach (6,1) and eat that apple. That's a direct path. Let's check if that path is clear.\n\nCurrent head (3,1) → DOWN to (4,1): safe (no body, no wall). Then (4,1) → DOWN to (5,1): row 5 is \"#  A   #\", column 1 is ' ', so (5,1) is safe. Then (5,1) → DOWN to (6,1): which is the apple (A). So that's a clear path. So moving DOWN now would allow the snake to reach (6,1) in 3 steps (current epoch 32, after 3 steps, epoch 35), and eat that apple.\n\nWhat about the other apples? (5,3) is in row 5, column 3. To reach that from (3,1), the snake could go DOWN to (4,1), then RIGHT to (4,2), (4,3), then DOWN to (5,3). Let's check (4,3): row 4 is \"#   S  #\", column 3 is ' ', so (4,3) is safe. Then (5,3) is the apple. That's also possible but might take a bit longer.\n\nThe apple at (6,4) is in row 6, column 4. To reach there, the snake would need to go RIGHT from (3,1) to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) → but (3,4) is part of the body (current S in row 3, column 4), so that's a collision. So (3,4) is body, so can't go there. So perhaps that apple is harder to reach.\n\nSo the safest path is to go DOWN towards (6,1) apple. Because moving LEFT is into a wall (invalid), moving RIGHT could lead towards the body (if not careful), moving UP is reverse (invalid). So the best direction is to continue moving DOWN, which is safe and leads towards an apple.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#SSSSS #\n#H  SS #\n#   S  #\n#  A   #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and collision risks:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head ('H') is at (3,1) (row 3, column 1).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN (snake cannot reverse to UP).\n- **Apples**: Located at (5,3), (6,1), and (6,4).\n- **Body Segments ('S')**: Positions include (2,1)-(2,5), (3,4)-(3,5), and (4,4).\n\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: The head would move to (3,0), which is a wall ('#').

This cell is empty (no wall or body). While safe, moving RIGHT does not directly lead toward the nearest apple and risks future collisions with the body (e.g., (3,4) is a body segment).\n4. **DOWN**: The head moves to (4,1). This cell is empty (no wall or body). Continuing DOWN leads directly toward the apple at (6,1) (row 6, column 1), with a clear path: (3,1) → (4,1) → (5,1) → (6,1) (the apple). This path avoids all body segments and walls.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is the safest and most direct path to an apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as given. \n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls as '#'. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so positions 1,1 to 1,6 are empty)\nRow 2: #SSSSS # (positions 2,1 to 2,5 are 'S', 2,6 is empty)\nRow 3: #S  SS # (positions 3,1 is 'S', 3,2 and 3,3 are empty, 3,4 and 3,5 are 'S', 3,6 is empty)\nRow 4: #H     # (position 4,1 is 'H', rest 4,2-4,6 are empty)\nRow 5: #  A   # (position 5,3 is 'A', others 5,1-5,2,5,4-5,6 are empty)\nRow 6: #A  A  # (position 6,1 is 'A', 6,4 is 'A', others 6,2-6,3,6,5-6,6 are empty)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. Let's find the head's position. The head 'H' is in row 4, column 1 (assuming rows are 0-7 top to bottom, columns 0-7 left to right, but the first character is column 0, which is a wall). Wait, in row 4, it's \"#H     #\", so the 'H' is at (row 4, column 1) because the first '#' is column 0. Let's confirm coordinates:\n\nRow 4: columns 0 is '#', column 1 is 'H', columns 2-6 are ' ', column 7 is '#'. So head (H) is at (4,1).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So the next move (epoch 34) would be moving the head down to row 5, column 1. Let's check that position.\n\nRow 5 is \"#  A   #\", so column 1 is ' ' (since row 5: columns 0='#', 1=' ', 2=' ', 3='A', 4=' ', 5=' ', 6=' ', 7='#'). So (5,1) is empty. So moving down would take the head to (5,1), which is safe. But wait, what's the snake's body? Let's track the snake's body. The snake's body is made of 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 2: columns 1-5 are 'S' → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3: column 1 is 'S' → (3,1); columns 4-5 are 'S' → (3,4), (3,5)\nSo the snake's body is at these positions. The head is at (4,1). So the snake's length is 1 (head) plus the number of 'S's. Let's count 'S's: row 2 has 5, row 3 has 3 (1+2), so 5+3=8 S's. So the snake's current length is 9 (head + 8 body segments).\n\nNow, when the snake moves, the head moves in the current direction, and the body follows. Since the current direction is DOWN, the next head position is (5,1). Let's check if that's a wall or body. (5,1) is not a wall (since row 5, column 1 is within the board, not a '#'). Is (5,1) part of the body? The body positions are (2,1-5), (3,1), (3,4-5). (5,1) is not among them, so safe. So moving down is safe this time.\n\nBut the question is, what direction should we choose. The player can choose direction, but cannot reverse. The current direction is DOWN, so the snake can't reverse to UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since the current direction is DOWN, allowed directions are the same as current or perpendicular, not opposite).\n\nWait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So if current direction is DOWN, the snake can't turn to UP. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWe need to choose a direction that avoids collision with walls or self, and preferably leads towards apples.\n\nLet's check the possible next moves for each direction.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,1) (row 4, column 1). Let's note that rows increase as we go down (row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom). Columns increase to the right (column 0 is left, column 7 is right).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So the next head position if direction remains DOWN is (5,1). Let's check (5,1): as before, it's empty. So that's safe. Then, after moving, the body segments will shift. The previous head (4,1) becomes 'S', and the new head is (5,1).\n\nWhat's in (5,1)? It's empty. So the snake moves there, body follows, no apple eaten. So score remains same.\n\nIf we choose direction LEFT: the snake's current direction is DOWN. Can it turn LEFT? Yes, because LEFT is not the reverse (reverse of DOWN is UP). So direction LEFT is allowed. The head would move to (4,0) (since moving left from (4,1) would be column 0). But (4,0) is a wall ('#'), so that's a collision. So moving LEFT is invalid, game over. So LEFT is not allowed.\n\nIf we choose direction RIGHT: direction is RIGHT. The head moves to (4,2) (column 1 +1 = 2). Let's check (4,2): row 4, column 2 is ' ' (from the board \"#H     #\", so after H (column 1), columns 2-6 are empty). So (4,2) is empty. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,2). Is that part of the body? The body positions are (2,1-5), (3,1), (3,4-5). (4,2) is not in any of these. So safe.\n\nSo possible directions: DOWN, RIGHT. Let's check what's in those directions.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (5,1). What's around (5,1)? The next position would be (6,1) if direction remains DOWN. (6,1) is an 'A' (row 6: \"#A  A  #\", so column 1 is 'A'). So if we go DOWN this time, next move (epoch 34) head is (5,1), then next epoch (35) moving DOWN again would reach (6,1) which is an apple. That would be good.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (4,2). Then the next possible moves. Let's see, after moving RIGHT, the head is at (4,2). Then, possible directions (current direction would be RIGHT now, so can't reverse to LEFT). Next move could be RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Let's see if there are apples in that direction. The apples are at (5,3), (6,1), (6,4). From (4,2), moving RIGHT would go to (4,3), then (4,4), etc. (5,3) is an apple. So (4,2) → (4,3) → (4,4) → (5,4) → (5,3) (apple). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (4,2) would go to (5,2), which is empty. Then (5,2) → (5,3) (apple). So (4,2) → (5,2) (DOWN) → (5,3) (RIGHT) would reach the apple in (5,3) in two moves.\n\nBut let's compare the two options:\n\nOption 1: Current direction DOWN. Move to (5,1) (safe). Next move, if direction remains DOWN, (6,1) which is an apple. So in epoch 34, head at (5,1), then epoch 35, moving DOWN to (6,1) (apple). Eating that apple would increase the score, and the snake grows. That's a good path.\n\nOption 2: Direction RIGHT. Move to (4,2) (safe). Then, the next possible direction could be DOWN to (5,2), then RIGHT to (5,3) (apple). That's also possible but takes an extra step.\n\nBut what's the immediate next step. Let's check if moving DOWN now (epoch 33's direction) leads to (5,1). Is (5,1) safe? Yes. Then, in the next epoch (34), the snake's direction could still be DOWN, moving to (6,1) which is an apple. That's better.\n\nSo choosing to continue moving DOWN would lead to an apple in the next step, which is optimal. So the best direction is DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#SSSSS #\n#S  SS #\n#H     #\n#  A   #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (4, 1) (row 4, column 1). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse to UP. Possible directions to choose are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (4, 1) would take the head to (4, 0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. So LEFT is invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (4, 1) would take the head to (4, 2), which is empty and not part of the snake's body. This is safe but does not immediately lead to an apple.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (4, 1) takes the head to (5, 1), which is empty and safe. The next move (if direction remains DOWN) would reach (6, 1), which is an apple ('A'), allowing the snake to eat it and grow.  \n\nContinuing DOWN is optimal as it leads directly toward an apple in the next step.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so positions (1,1) to (1,6) are empty)\nRow 2: #SSSSS # (so positions (2,1)=S, (2,2)=S, (2,3)=S, (2,4)=S, (2,5)=S; (2,6) is empty)\nRow 3: #S   S # (positions (3,1)=S, (3,5)=S; (3,2-4) are empty)\nRow 4: #S     # (position (4,1)=S; (4,2-6) empty)\nRow 5: #H A   # (position (5,1)=H (head), (5,3)=A (apple))\nRow 6: #A  A  # (positions (6,1)=A, (6,4)=A)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at (5,1) (row 5, column 1, assuming rows start at 0). Since the current direction is DOWN, the next move would be to row 6, column 1. Let's check where that is.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 1: the cell is 'A' (apple). So if the snake moves DOWN (current direction), it will move to (6,1), which is an apple. Eating the apple would make the snake grow. Also, moving DOWN is allowed because the current direction is DOWN, and the snake can't reverse direction. Reversing would be if the current direction was UP and we tried to go DOWN, but here current is DOWN, so possible directions are UP (reverse, not allowed), LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. Wait, the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is DOWN, the snake can't turn UP (reverse). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since that's the current direction, not a reverse).\n\nSo let's check the possible moves:\n\nCurrent head position: (5,1). Current direction is DOWN. Next possible positions based on direction:\n\n- If direction is DOWN: next head position is (6,1). What's there? Row 6, column 1 is 'A' (apple). So that's safe (not a wall or body). So moving DOWN here would eat the apple, increase the score, and the snake grows. The new head is (6,1), and the body would extend. Also, after moving, we need to check if this position is a wall or body. (6,1) is within the board (rows 0-7, columns 0-7; row 6 is valid, column 1 is valid, not a wall). The body parts: where are the S's? Let's list all S positions (excluding H, which is the head):\n\nFrom row 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3: (3,1), (3,5)\nRow 4: (4,1)\nSo (6,1) is not among these S positions, so no collision with self. So moving DOWN is safe and gets an apple.\n\nWhat about other directions? Let's check:\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake can't reverse to UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\nCheck LEFT: moving LEFT from (5,1) would take the head to (5,0). But (5,0) is a wall (since row 5 starts with '#'), so that's a collision with the wall. So LEFT is invalid (game over).\n\nCheck RIGHT: moving RIGHT from (5,1) would take the head to (5,2). What's (5,2)? Row 5 is \"#H A   #\", so positions (5,0)='#', (5,1)='H', (5,2) is space (empty), (5,3)='A', etc. So (5,2) is empty. Now, check if that's a body part. The existing S positions are (2,1-5), (3,1), (3,5), (4,1). (5,2) is not in any of those, so moving RIGHT is safe. But there's no apple there. So moving RIGHT would just move the head to (5,2), no apple eaten.\n\nCheck UP: reverse direction, which is not allowed. So UP is invalid.\n\nSo the options are DOWN (safe, apple), RIGHT (safe, no apple), LEFT (wall collision, game over). So the best move is DOWN, which allows eating the apple and growing, without collision.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#SSSSS #\n#S   S #\n#S     #\n#H A   #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5,1) (row 5, column 1) and is currently moving DOWN. The next possible moves are evaluated as follows:\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5,1) leads to (6,1), which contains an apple ('A'). This position is within the board (not a wall) and does not collide with the snake's body (existing 'S' positions are (2,1-5), (3,1), (3,5), (4,1)). Eating the apple is safe and increases the score.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,1) leads to (5,0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision and ends the game.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5,1) leads to (5,2), an empty space. No apple is present here, and no collision occurs, but this does not improve the score.\n- **UP**: Reversing direction (current direction is DOWN) is not allowed.\n\nThe safest and most beneficial move is DOWN, as it allows the snake to eat an apple without collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so positions (1,1) to (1,6) are empty)\nRow 2: #SSSSS # (positions (2,1) to (2,5) are 'S' (snake body), (2,6) is empty)\nRow 3: #S   S # (positions (3,1) is 'S', (3,4) is 'S', others (3,2-3,3,3,5) are empty)\nRow 4: #S     # (position (4,1) is 'S', others (4,2-4,6) are empty)\nRow 5: #S AA  # (position (5,1) is 'S', (5,3) and (5,4) are 'A' (apples), (5,5-5,6) are empty)\nRow 6: #H  A  # (position (6,1) is 'H' (head), (6,4) is 'A', (6,2-6,3,6,5-6,6) are empty)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. The snake's head is at (6,1) (since row 6, column 1 is 'H'). Let's confirm the coordinates. Usually, in grids, rows are y and columns are x. So (row, column) where row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom. So H is at (6,1).\n\nThe snake's body is in the positions marked 'S'. Let's list all the snake's body segments. Let's go row by row:\n\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) → 5 S's here.\nRow 3: (3,1), (3,4) → 2 S's.\nRow 4: (4,1) → 1 S.\nRow 5: (5,1) → 1 S.\nSo total body segments: 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 9. The head is 1, so total length is 10? Because snake starts with length 1 (head), each apple eaten adds 1. So if the snake has 9 body segments, that's 9 apples eaten (since length = 1 + number of apples). So current score is 9.\n\nNow, the current direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. So the next head position would be (7,1) if it continues DOWN. But row 7 is the bottom wall (all '#'), so moving DOWN would make the head hit the wall, which is a collision. That's bad. So we can't go DOWN.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is DOWN, so the reverse direction is UP. So can't turn UP (since that's reversing). So possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT, because the snake can't reverse (so from DOWN, can't go UP, but can go LEFT or RIGHT).\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So reversing is when current direction is X, and new direction is the opposite. So for current direction DOWN, the opposite is UP. So the snake can't choose UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (but DOWN is into a wall, which is bad). So we need to choose between LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nLet's check the head's current position: (6,1). Let's get the coordinates right. Let's index rows from top (0) to bottom (7), columns from left (0) to right (7). So row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom. Column 0 is leftmost (all '#'), column 7 is rightmost (all '#').\n\nSo H is at (6,1) (row 6, column 1). The current direction is DOWN, so moving down would take it to (7,1). But row 7 is the bottom wall (row 7 is ########, so column 1 is '#'). So (7,1) is a wall. So moving DOWN would result in collision, game over. So can't go DOWN.\n\nSo the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (but UP is reverse, so not allowed). Wait, no: the snake's movement direction is controlled by the player's input, but the snake can't reverse direction. So the current direction is DOWN. The player can input a new direction, but it can't be the reverse (UP). So allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue moving DOWN (but that's into a wall). So the player must choose between LEFT or RIGHT, since UP is reverse and DOWN is into wall.\n\nLet's check where LEFT and RIGHT would take the head.\n\nCurrent head position is (6,1). Let's list the coordinates (row, column):\n\n- Moving LEFT: column decreases by 1 → (6,0). But column 0 is a wall (since row 6 is #H  A  # → column 0 is '#'). So (6,0) is a wall. So moving LEFT would hit the wall. That's a collision, game over.\n\n- Moving RIGHT: column increases by 1 → (6,2). Let's check row 6: #H  A  #. So the row 6 is [ '#', 'H', ' ', ' ', 'A', ' ', ' ', '#' ]. So (6,2) is ' ' (empty). So moving RIGHT would take the head to (6,2), which is empty. That's safe.\n\nWhat about the snake's body? Are there any S's in (6,2)? Let's check all S positions:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 2 (index 2): columns 1-5 are S → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nRow 3 (index 3): column 1 and 4 → (3,1), (3,4).\n\nRow 4 (index 4): column 1 → (4,1).\n\nRow 5 (index 5): column 1 → (5,1).\n\nSo none of the body segments are in (6,2). So moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe (no collision with self).\n\nAlso, check if there's an apple in (6,2). In row 6, the H is at (6,1), then (6,2) is ' ', (6,3) is ' ', (6,4) is 'A', (6,5) is ' ', (6,6) is ' ', (6,7) is '#'. So (6,2) is empty. So moving RIGHT would not eat an apple, but the snake would move there, and the tail would move (since the snake's length is 10, so when moving, the head moves to (6,2), and the tail (the last segment) would be removed, unless an apple is eaten.\n\nWait, but the snake's length is 10 (head + 9 body segments). So when moving, if no apple is eaten, the snake moves forward: head moves to new position, and the tail (the last segment) is removed. So the body shifts.\n\nBut the key here is to avoid collision and eat apples. Let's see where the apples are.\n\nApples are 'A's. Let's list all 'A's in the board:\n\nRow 5: #S AA  # → columns 3 and 4 (row 5, columns 3 and 4: (5,3), (5,4)).\n\nRow 6: #H  A  # → column 4 (row 6, column 4: (6,4)).\n\nSo apples at (5,3), (5,4), (6,4).\n\nCurrent head is at (6,1). Let's see possible next moves and their outcomes.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT:\n\nHead moves to (6,2). No apple here. Then the snake's body shifts. The new body would be the previous positions except the tail. The tail is the last segment. Let's track the snake's body. The snake's body is a sequence. Since the snake is moving down, the head was moving down. Let's think about the snake's path. The head is at (6,1). The previous positions of the head would have been (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), etc. Because row 5, column 1 is S (so the head was there before moving down to row 6). So the snake's body is in a vertical line from row 2 (column 1) down to row 5 (column 1), then in row 2, columns 2-5, and row 3, column 4.\n\nSo the body segments, in order (from head to tail), might be:\n\nHead: (6,1)\n\nThen the next segment (neck) is (5,1) (since the head was there before moving down).\n\nThen (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4).\n\nSo the tail is (3,4). So when moving right to (6,2), the new head is (6,2), and the tail (3,4) is removed. So the new body segments would be (6,1) (old head), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). So (3,4) is no longer part of the body. That's safe.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT, the next head is (6,2), which is safe.\n\nIf we choose UP: that's reverse direction (current direction is DOWN), so not allowed. The player can't input UP.\n\nIf we choose LEFT: (6,0) is a wall. So collision, game over.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: (7,1) is a wall. Collision, game over.\n\nSo the only safe direction is RIGHT. So the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#SSSSS #\n#S   S #\n#S     #\n#S AA  #\n#H  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,1) (row 6, column 1) and is currently moving DOWN. The next possible moves are evaluated as follows:\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,1), which is a wall (row 7 is entirely walls). This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **UP**: The current direction is DOWN, and reversing to UP is not allowed (snake cannot reverse direction).  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (6,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall in all rows). This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6,2). This position is empty (no walls or snake body segments) and is safe. No apple is present here, but the snake avoids collision and continues.  \n\nThe only safe direction to avoid immediate collision is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let's list out each row to visualize it better:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so columns 1-6 are empty here)\nRow 2: #SSSSS # (columns 1-5 are 'S', column 6 is empty)\nRow 3: #S     # (column 1 is 'S', others empty)\nRow 4: #S     # (column 1 is 'S')\nRow 5: #S AA  # (column 1 is 'S', columns 4 and 5 are 'A's)\nRow 6: #SH A  # (column 1 is 'S', column 2 is 'H' (head), column 4 is 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the snake is moving right. The snake's head is at (6,2) since row 6 is the 7th row (assuming rows start at 0). Let's confirm the positions:\n\nLooking at row 6: #SH A  #. So positions in row 6 (columns 0-7):\n0: # (wall)\n1: S (body)\n2: H (head)\n3:  (space)\n4: A (apple)\n5:  (space)\n6:  (space)\n7: # (wall)\nSo head is at (row 6, column 2). Since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move would be to (row 6, column 3) if we continue RIGHT.\n\nNow, the snake's body positions. Let's track the body. The snake is made of 'S' and 'H'. The head is 'H', and the body is 'S's. Let's list all the positions of 'S' and 'H':\n\nRow 2: columns 1-5 are S: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3: column 1: (3,1)\nRow 4: column 1: (4,1)\nRow 5: column 1: (5,1)\nRow 6: column 1: (6,1) (this is S), column 2: H (head)\n\nSo the snake's body is a long vertical line from row 2, column 1 down to row 6, column 1. Then, from row 2, column 1, it goes right to row 2, columns 2-5. So the snake's structure is like a vertical line (rows 2-6, column 1) and then a horizontal line (row 2, columns 1-5). The head is at (6,2), which is to the right of (6,1) (which is S). So the snake's movement direction is RIGHT, so the head is moving right.\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, so the snake can't reverse direction to LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT is the opposite of RIGHT, which is not allowed).\n\nNow, the next move: the head is at (6,2). If moving RIGHT, next position is (6,3). Let's check if that's safe. (6,3) is a space (from row 6: #SH A  # → column 3 is space). So that's empty. No collision with body or wall.\n\nIf we choose UP: moving up would take the head from (6,2) to (5,2). Let's check (5,2). Row 5 is #S AA  #. Columns 0: #, 1:S, 2: (space), 3: (space), 4:A, 5:A. So (5,2) is space. Is that safe? The body positions: (5,1) is S. (5,2) is empty, so no collision.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: moving down from (6,2) would go to (7,2), which is a wall (row 7 is ########), so that's a collision. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are RIGHT, UP, or maybe others. Wait, the current direction is RIGHT, so the snake can't reverse to LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. But DOWN leads to wall, so only UP and RIGHT are possible.\n\nNow, let's check if there's an apple in the next positions. The current head is at (6,2). Let's look for apples (A) on the board.\n\nRow 5: #S AA  # → columns 4 and 5 are A (positions (5,4), (5,5))\nRow 6: #SH A  # → column 4 is A (position (6,4))\n\nSo apples are at (5,4), (5,5), (6,4).\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (6,3), then next position is (6,3) (empty). Then, after moving, the snake's body would shift. Since the snake is moving, the tail (the last S) would stay if it's growing (if it eats an apple) or move if not. But in this case, if the next position isn't an apple, the tail would move. But the current question is which direction to choose to avoid collision and eat apples.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (6,3), then next step, the head is there. Then, if the next move after that could be towards the apple at (6,4). Because (6,4) is an apple. So moving RIGHT again would take the head to (6,4), which is an apple. Then, eating that apple would grow the snake.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves UP to (5,2). Let's check (5,2): is that a safe position. The body is at (5,1), which is S, but (5,2) is empty. So no collision. Then, from (5,2), possible directions (since current direction would be UP now). The snake can't reverse direction (if the new direction is UP, the previous was RIGHT, so allowed). From (5,2), moving UP would take to (4,2). Let's check (4,2): row 4 is #S     # → column 1 is S, column 2 is space. So (4,2) is safe. Then, maybe towards the apples at (5,4) and (5,5).\n\nBut let's see the immediate next step. The priority is to avoid collision and eat apples. Let's check if moving RIGHT now would lead to the apple in the next step.\n\nCurrent head at (6,2). Moving RIGHT to (6,3) (empty). Then, next epoch, if direction is still RIGHT, the head would move to (6,4), which is an apple. So that's good. So in two steps, the snake can eat that apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,2) now. Then, in the next step, direction could be RIGHT (since current direction would be UP, so can turn RIGHT). Then, from (5,2), moving RIGHT to (5,3), then (5,4) (apple). That's also possible.\n\nBut let's check if moving RIGHT now is safe. The next position (6,3) is empty, and the body is not there. The body positions are (2,1-5), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So (6,3) is not part of the body. So that's safe.\n\nWhat about moving UP: (5,2) is empty, and no body there, so that's safe.\n\nSo both UP and RIGHT are possible. But which is better?\n\nThe snake's current direction is RIGHT. If we choose to continue RIGHT, the next position is (6,3), which is safe. Then, the next move (epoch 37) could be RIGHT again to (6,4), which is an apple. That would be good.\n\nIf we choose UP, then the next position is (5,2). Then, from there, possible directions. Let's see the body. The snake's body is a vertical line along column 1 (rows 2-6). So the body is not in column 2 except for row 2 (row 2 has S in columns 1-5, so (2,2) is S). So (5,2) is not part of the body. So moving UP is safe.\n\nBut let's check if moving UP could lead to a collision in the next steps. For example, if the snake goes up into row 5, column 2, then perhaps moving towards the apples in row 5, columns 4 and 5. That's possible.\n\nBut the apple at (6,4) is closer. So moving RIGHT now, then RIGHT again would reach that apple in the next step. That's more direct.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's body. Let's make sure that moving in any direction doesn't hit the body. Let's confirm the body positions again:\n\nBody positions (all S's):\n\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1)\nRow 5: (5,1)\nRow 6: (6,1)\n\nHead is at (6,2). So the body is to the left of the head (column 1) in row 6, and the body extends up along column 1 to row 2, then right along row 2 to column 5.\n\nSo, if the snake moves RIGHT to (6,3), the new head is (6,3). The next position (6,4) is an apple. So that's a good move. So moving RIGHT now would allow the snake to reach the apple in the next step. So the best direction here is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#SSSSS #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S AA  #\n#SH A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (row 6, column 2), moving RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (6,2) would lead to (7,2), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'), causing a collision. This is invalid.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP from (6,2) would go to (5,2). Checking row 5: \"#S AA  #\", column 2 is empty (no body or wall), so this is safe but does not reach an apple immediately.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (6,2) goes to (6,3), which is empty (no collision). The next position (6,4) in the following move (if direction remains RIGHT) contains an apple ('A'), allowing the snake to eat it and grow.  \n\nRIGHT is the safest and most direct path to an apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list out each row to visualize it better:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so positions 1,1 to 1,6 are empty)\nRow 2: #SSSS  # (so positions 2,1 is S, 2,2 is S, 2,3 is S, 2,4 is S, 2,5 and 2,6 are empty)\nRow 3: #S     # (position 3,1 is S, others in row 3 from 2-6 are empty)\nRow 4: #S     # (position 4,1 is S, others empty)\nRow 5: #S AA  # (position 5,1 is S, 5,3 and 5,4 are A, 5,5 and 5,6 empty)\nRow 6: #SSHA  # (positions 6,1: S, 6,2: S, 6,3: H (head), 6,4: A)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right. Let's confirm the head's position. The head 'H' is at row 6, column 3 (since rows are 0-7, columns 0-7, with the first character being column 0, which is the wall). So H is at (6,3). The current direction is RIGHT, so the next move would be to (6,4) if we continue RIGHT. Let's check what's at (6,4). Looking at row 6: \"#SSHA  #\", so column 4 is 'A' (since row 6 is \"#SSHA  #\", the characters are: 0:'#', 1:'S', 2:'S', 3:'H', 4:'A', 5:' ', 6:' ', 7:'#'). So (6,4) is an apple. If the snake moves RIGHT, the head moves to (6,4), which is an apple. That means the snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score increases by 1. \n\nNow, we need to check if moving RIGHT is possible. The snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is RIGHT. Reversing would be LEFT, so any direction except LEFT is allowed (since reversing is not allowed). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse). Wait, the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is RIGHT, the next direction can't be LEFT. So allowed directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nSo moving RIGHT is allowed. Let's check if moving RIGHT causes a collision. The new head position is (6,4), which is an apple. After moving, the snake's body will follow. Since the snake is growing (because it ate an apple), the tail doesn't move. Let's think about the snake's body before the move. The snake's body is made up of the 'S's and the 'H'. Let's list the positions of the snake's body:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6: 'SSHA' → positions (6,1)=S, (6,2)=S, (6,3)=H.\n\nRow 5: 'S AA' → (5,1)=S.\n\nRow 4: 'S     ' → (4,1)=S.\n\nRow 3: 'S     ' → (3,1)=S.\n\nRow 2: 'SSSS  ' → (2,1)=S, (2,2)=S, (2,3)=S, (2,4)=S.\n\nSo the snake's body positions (from head to tail, perhaps) are:\n\nHead at (6,3). Then, the body segments are (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Let's confirm that. Because the snake moves, each part follows the previous. The current direction is RIGHT, so the head is moving right. The body behind would follow. So the snake's body is a chain. Let's list all the 'S' and 'H' positions:\n\nH is (6,3).\n\nS positions:\n\nRow 6, column 1: (6,1)\n\nRow 6, column 2: (6,2)\n\nRow 5, column 1: (5,1)\n\nRow 4, column 1: (4,1)\n\nRow 3, column 1: (3,1)\n\nRow 2, column 1: (2,1)\n\nRow 2, column 2: (2,2)\n\nRow 2, column 3: (2,3)\n\nRow 2, column 4: (2,4)\n\nSo the snake's body is a long chain. Now, if the head moves to (6,4) (RIGHT), which is an apple. The new head position is (6,4). Since the snake ate an apple, the tail does not shrink. So the body will now include the previous head (6,3) as a new body segment. The rest of the body segments shift. Let's see: the previous head was (6,3), which becomes S. The new head is (6,4). The rest of the body would be (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). So the new body positions would include all these, plus the new head. But since it's growing, the tail remains. So no collision here because (6,4) is an apple, not a wall or body.\n\nNow, check other possible directions. Let's see what happens if we choose UP, DOWN, or LEFT (but LEFT is reverse, so not allowed). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf direction is UP: current head is (6,3). UP would move to (5,3). Let's check (5,3) on the board. Row 5 is \"#S AA  #\", so columns are 0:'#', 1:'S', 2:' ', 3:'A', 4:'A', 5:' ', 6:' ', 7:'#'. So (5,3) is 'A'. So moving UP would take the head to (5,3), which is an apple. That's good. But need to check if that's possible. The current direction is RIGHT, so turning UP is allowed (since it's not reverse). Now, check collision. (5,3) is an apple, not a wall or body. So that's possible. But which direction gives a better outcome?\n\nIf direction is DOWN: current head is (6,3). DOWN would move to (7,3). But row 7 is the bottom wall (all '#'). So (7,3) is a wall. Moving DOWN would cause collision with the wall, game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: reverse of RIGHT, which is not allowed. So invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP and RIGHT. Let's compare.\n\nMoving RIGHT: new head (6,4) which is 'A' (apple). Safe, no collision. The snake eats the apple, grows.\n\nMoving UP: new head (5,3) which is 'A' (apple). Also safe, no collision. The snake eats the apple, grows.\n\nSo both directions are possible. Which is better? Let's see the next steps. Let's think about the snake's body and possible future moves.\n\nCurrent snake body is mostly along the left side (column 1) from row 2 to row 6. Then, in row 6, it's (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)=H. So the snake's body is in a sort of \"L\" shape: vertical along column 1 (rows 2-6), then horizontal right in row 6 (columns 1-3).\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (6,4):\n\nNew head at (6,4). The next move direction could be RIGHT again (if possible), but after that, the head would be at (6,5). Let's check (6,5) on the current board: row 6 is \"#SSHA  #\", so (6,5) is ' ', empty. So that's possible. But maybe there are other apples. Let's check where the apples are. Current apples are in row 5, columns 3 and 4 (positions (5,3) and (5,4)), and row 6, column 4 (position (6,4)) which is the one we're about to eat. So after eating (6,4), the remaining apples are (5,3) and (5,4).\n\nIf we move UP to (5,3):\n\nNew head at (5,3), which is an apple. Then, the next direction could be UP (to (4,3)), RIGHT (to (5,4)), etc. (5,4) is also an apple. So moving UP now would allow the snake to reach (5,4) next, which is another apple. Let's see:\n\nIf current move is UP, head moves to (5,3) (apple). Then, next direction could be RIGHT (since current direction would be UP, so next direction can't be DOWN). Moving RIGHT from (5,3) would go to (5,4), which is another apple. That's two apples in two moves. \n\nIf current move is RIGHT, head moves to (6,4) (apple). Then, next direction could be UP (since current direction is RIGHT, next can't be LEFT). Moving UP from (6,4) would go to (5,4), which is an apple. That's also two apples in two moves.\n\nHmm. Both paths can lead to eating two apples. But let's check the snake's body positions to see if any moves would cause collision.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (6,4):\n\nThe new body positions would be:\n\nHead: (6,4)\n\nBody segments: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\nSo, if next move is UP (from (6,4)), the new head would be (5,4). Let's check (5,4) on the original board: it's an 'A'. So moving UP to (5,4) is safe (apple), no collision.\n\nAfter moving UP to (5,3):\n\nNew body positions:\n\nHead: (5,3)\n\nBody segments: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\nThen, moving RIGHT to (5,4) (apple), which is safe.\n\nSo both directions are viable. But perhaps there's a better option. Let's check if there are any other possible collisions in the next steps.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's current body. For example, if we move UP, the new head is (5,3). Let's check if (5,3) is adjacent to any body parts. The body segments near (5,3) are (5,1) (S), (6,3) (H before moving, which becomes S after moving). So (5,3) is (5,3), and (5,1) is two columns left, (6,3) is one row down. So no collision.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (6,4), the new head is (6,4). The body segments near (6,4) are (6,3) (new S), (6,2) (S), etc. (6,4) is to the right of (6,3), which is now part of the body. But since the snake is moving into (6,4) which is an apple, and the body is following, there's no collision here. Because the body segments are the previous positions. So when the head moves, the body follows, so the new head's position is not overlapping with any body segments (except if the snake is moving into its own body).\n\nIn this case, moving RIGHT: (6,4) is empty (apple), not a body part. So safe.\n\nMoving UP: (5,3) is apple, not a body part. Safe.\n\nSo both directions are safe. But perhaps the problem is that the current direction is RIGHT, and the example shows that when moving in the current direction, you can eat the apple. So which is better? The question is to choose the direction that allows the snake to eat as many apples as possible and avoid collision. Since both directions lead to eating an apple now, but perhaps the next move after that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better path. Let's check if there are other apples. The current apples are at (5,3), (5,4), and (6,4). So (6,4) is in the current direction. So moving RIGHT now would eat that apple, then next move could be UP to (5,4), which is another apple. That's two apples in two moves. Similarly, moving UP now (to (5,3)), then RIGHT to (5,4) (another apple). So same result.\n\nBut perhaps the snake's body is arranged such that one direction is more optimal. Let's think about the snake's length. The snake's current length: let's count the number of 'S's and 'H's. \n\nH is 1. S's: \n\nRow 2: 4 S's (columns 1-4)\nRow 3: 1 S (column 1)\nRow 4: 1 S (column 1)\nRow 5: 1 S (column 1)\nRow 6: 2 S's (columns 1-2)\nTotal S's: 4+1+1+1+2=9. So total length is 9+1=10.\n\nWhen the snake eats an apple, it grows by 1, so length becomes 11.\n\nIn any case, both directions are safe. But perhaps the best choice is to continue in the current direction (RIGHT) since it's the direction the snake is already moving, and there's an apple directly in front. So the answer would be RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S AA  #\n#SSHA  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (6, 3) (row 6, column 3) and is currently moving RIGHT. The next possible moves must not reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The valid directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7, 3), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (5, 3), which is an apple ('A'). This is safe and would allow the snake to eat the apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6, 4), which is also an apple ('A'). This is safe and would allow the snake to eat the apple.  \n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, both are valid and lead to eating an apple. However, moving RIGHT continues the snake's current direction and directly targets the apple in front, which is a straightforward and safe choice. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls (#######) around the edges. Let's parse each row from top to bottom:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #    A # (so positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are empty; (1,4) is A; (1,5) is empty; (1,6) is empty; (1,7) is #)\nRow 2: #SSSS  # (positions (2,1) S, (2,2) S, (2,3) S, (2,4) S, (2,5) empty, (2,6) empty, (2,7) #)\nRow 3: #S     # (position (3,1) S; (3,2)-(3,6) empty)\nRow 4: #S     # (position (4,1) S; (4,2)-(4,6) empty)\nRow 5: #S AA  # (position (5,1) S; (5,2) empty; (5,3) A; (5,4) A; (5,5)-(5,6) empty)\nRow 6: #SSSH  # (position (6,1) S, (6,2) S, (6,3) S, (6,4) H; (6,5)-(6,6) empty; (6,7) #)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at position (6,4). The current direction is RIGHT. Let's confirm the snake's body positions. The body (S) is in the following positions:\n\nLooking at the rows:\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1)\nRow 5: (5,1)\nRow 6: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nSo the snake's body is a long line going up from row 6,1 up to row 2,1, then turns right to row 2,2, 2,3, 2,4. The head is at (6,4), moving RIGHT. \n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction, so if it's moving RIGHT, the next direction can't be LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT is the reverse).\n\nNow, the snake's head is at (6,4). Let's see where moving in each possible direction would take it.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. Let's list possible directions and their next positions:\n\n- RIGHT: next position (6,5). Let's check what's there. Row 6 is \"#SSSH  #\", so (6,5) is empty (since after H at (6,4), positions (6,5) and (6,6) are empty). So moving RIGHT to (6,5). Is that a valid position? Check if it's a wall or body. (6,5) is within the grid (rows 0-7, columns 0-7; 6 is row, 5 is column; 0-based). The wall is at column 7 (since row 6 starts with # at column 0 and ends with # at column 7). So (6,5) is not a wall. Check if it's a body (S). The body positions are (2,1-4), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1-3). (6,5) is not in any of these. So moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe.\n\n- UP: current head is at (6,4). UP direction would take it to (5,4). Let's check row 5: \"#S AA  #\". So row 5 has positions (5,0)=#, (5,1)=S, (5,2)=empty, (5,3)=A, (5,4)=A, (5,5)=empty, (5,6)=empty, (5,7)=#. So (5,4) is A (an apple). So moving UP to (5,4) would eat the apple, which is good. But we need to check if (5,4) is a body part. The body positions are as listed before. (5,4) is not in the body positions (since (5,1) is S, (5,3) and (5,4) are A). So moving UP is possible, and would eat an apple, increasing the score.\n\n- DOWN: current head is at (6,4). DOWN direction would take it to (7,4). But row 7 is ########, so (7,4) is a wall. So moving DOWN would cause a collision with the wall, game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, RIGHT. LEFT is invalid (reverse direction).\n\nNow, let's check the UP direction: (5,4) is A. If the snake moves UP, the head moves to (5,4), which is an apple. Then, the snake grows in length. The new head is at (5,4), and the body will follow. The previous head (6,4) becomes part of the body. So the body would now include (6,4) as a new S, and the rest of the body shifts.\n\nIs there any danger in moving UP? Let's check if (5,4) is adjacent to any body parts. The body parts around (5,4) would be (5,1) (S), (5,3) (A), (5,4) (A). The new head (5,4) is A, so no collision. After moving, the next positions would be safe.\n\nWhat about moving RIGHT? (6,5) is empty. So that's safe, but no apple. The snake would just move there, no growth.\n\nThe goal is to eat as many apples as possible. So moving UP to eat the apple (A at (5,4)) is better. So the best direction is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S AA  #\n#SSSH  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6,4), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT is invalid. Let's analyze possible directions:\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,4), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. Invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6,5), which is empty (no walls or body parts). Safe but no apple.\n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (5,4), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or body) and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing.\n\nTo maximize the score, moving UP to eat the apple is optimal.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by analyzing the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let's list out each row to see where everything is:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #    A # (so positions 1,1 is empty; 1,4 is A)\nRow 2: #SSSS  # (positions 2,1 to 2,4 are S; 2,5 and 2,6 are empty)\nRow 3: #S     # (position 3,1 is S; others in the row are empty except the walls)\nRow 4: #S    A# (position 4,1 is S; 4,5 is A)\nRow 5: #S AH  # (position 5,1 is S; 5,2 is A? Wait, wait, let's check. The row is \"#S AH  #\". Let's index each position from 0 to 7 (since it's 8 characters). The first character is '#', then position 1 is 'S', position 2 is ' ', position 3 is 'A', position 4 is 'H', positions 5 and 6 are ' ', and position 7 is '#'. So row 5: columns 0: #, 1:S, 2: (space), 3:A, 4:H, 5: (space), 6: (space), 7: #. Oh right, so the head 'H' is at (5,4) (row 5, column 4). The current direction is UP. \n\nRow 6: #SSSS  # (positions 6,1 to 6,4 are S; 6,5-6 are empty)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the snake's head is at (5,4). The current direction is UP. The snake moves in the current direction unless a new direction is given (but can't reverse). The possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. But since the current direction is UP, the snake can't reverse to DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because reversing would be DOWN (since current is UP), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's track the snake's body to avoid collision. Let's map the positions of 'S' and 'H'. The head is at (5,4). Let's find the body segments. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1)\nRow 5: (5,1)\nRow 6: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo the body positions are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\nThe head is at (5,4). Let's think about where the snake will move next. The current direction is UP, so if we choose UP, the next head position would be (5-1,4) = (4,4). Let's check that cell. What's in (4,4)? Row 4 is \"#S    A#\", so columns 0 is #, 1 is S, 2-4 are spaces, 5 is A. So (4,4) is a space. So moving UP would take the head to (4,4), which is empty. No collision here.\n\nIf we choose LEFT direction, the next head position is (5,4-1) = (5,3). Let's check (5,3). Looking at row 5: \"#S AH  #\", column 3 is 'A'. Oh, there's an apple there! So moving LEFT would take the head to (5,3), which is an apple. Eating that apple would make the snake grow. So that's a good move because it increases the score.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT direction, the next head position is (5,4+1) = (5,5). What's (5,5)? Row 5 has columns 5 as a space. So (5,5) is empty. No collision.\n\nIf we choose DOWN, that's reversing direction (since current is UP), which is not allowed. So that's invalid.\n\nNow, check for collisions in each possible direction:\n\nUP: (4,4) is empty. No collision. So safe.\n\nLEFT: (5,3) is 'A' (apple). So safe, and the snake eats the apple, grows. So that's good.\n\nRIGHT: (5,5) is empty. Safe.\n\nNow, are there any other factors? Let's check if moving LEFT would cause a collision with the body. The new head position after moving LEFT is (5,3). The body positions are all the S's listed earlier. (5,3) is not in the body positions, so that's safe. So moving LEFT would eat an apple, which is beneficial.\n\nMoving UP: (4,4) is empty. So no apple. So that's a normal move, no score gain.\n\nMoving RIGHT: (5,5) is empty. No apple. So no score gain.\n\nSo the best option is to move LEFT, which allows the snake to eat an apple and increase the score. That's better than moving up or right which don't get an apple.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#S AH  #\n#SSSS  #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's head position, current direction, and potential moves:\n\n1. **Current State**: The snake's head 'H' is at (row 5, column 4). The current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n2. **Possible Moves**:\n   - **UP**: Next head position is (4, 4). This cell is empty (no collision, no apple).\n   - **LEFT**: Next head position is (5, 3). This cell contains an 'A' (apple). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake. No collision with the body or walls.\n   - **RIGHT**: Next head position is (5, 5). This cell is empty (no collision, no apple).\n\n3. **Optimal Choice**: Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, which is beneficial for increasing the score. Other directions do not yield apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #    A # (so positions (1,1) to (1,6) are: spaces, A at (1,4), then a space and #)\nRow 2: #SSSS  # (positions (2,1) to (2,5) are S, then two spaces)\nRow 3: #S  A  # (S at (3,1), then two spaces, A at (3,4), then two spaces)\nRow 4: #S    A# (S at (4,1), then three spaces, A at (4,5))\nRow 5: #S HS  # (S at (5,1), space, H at (5,3), S at (5,4), then a space)\nRow 6: #SSSS  # (positions (6,1) to (6,5) are S, then two spaces)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at position (5,3). Let's confirm the coordinates. Typically, in grids, rows are y-coordinates and columns are x-coordinates, so (row, column). Let's index from 0. So row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom. Column 0 is left, column 7 is right.\n\nSo the head 'H' is in row 5, column 3. The current direction is LEFT, which means the snake is moving towards decreasing column (left, so from column 3, next move would be to column 2 if direction remains LEFT). \n\nBut first, we need to check the snake's body positions. Let's list all 'S' and 'H' positions:\n\nRow 1: no S or H except A.\nRow 2: columns 1-4 are S (positions (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4))\nRow 3: column 1 is S (3,1)\nRow 4: column 1 is S (4,1)\nRow 5: column 1 is S (5,1), column 3 is H (5,3), column 4 is S (5,4)\nRow 6: columns 1-4 are S (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo the snake's body is a long one. Let's try to trace the snake's path. Since the head is at (5,3) and direction is LEFT (so moving left), the previous position (before the last move) would have been (5,4), which is S. Then before that, (5,5) isn't S, so maybe the body continues. Let's see:\n\nLooking at row 5: (5,1) is S, (5,3) H, (5,4) S. So (5,4) is part of the body. Then, where else?\n\nRow 6 has S from (6,1) to (6,4). So (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). \n\nRow 4 has S at (4,1). \n\nRow 3 has S at (3,1). \n\nRow 2 has S from (2,1) to (2,4). \n\nSo perhaps the snake's body is structured as a vertical line along column 1 from row 2 to row 6 (rows 2,3,4,5,6 in column 1), and then some parts in row 2,3,4,6 columns 2-4, and row 5 column 4. Let's try to list all S positions:\n\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n- (3,1)\n- (4,1)\n- (5,1), (5,4)\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nAnd H at (5,3).\n\nNow, the current direction is LEFT, so the snake is moving left. So the next head position would be (5,2) if direction is LEFT. Let's check if that's a valid position (not a wall, not body).\n\nFirst, check (5,2): row 5, column 2. The current cell at (5,2) in the board is a space (since row 5 is \"#S HS  #\", which breaks down as: column 0 is #, column 1 is S, column 2 is space, column 3 is H, column 4 is S, column 5 is space, column 6 is space, column 7 is #. So (5,2) is a space. So moving left (to (5,2)) is possible, but we need to check if that's safe (no collision with body or wall).\n\nBut let's consider possible directions. The player can choose LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, but cannot reverse direction. Current direction is LEFT, so the reverse would be RIGHT. So the snake can't turn directly to RIGHT. So possible directions are LEFT (current), UP, or DOWN. Because reversing (LEFT to RIGHT) is not allowed.\n\nSo possible next directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nWe need to evaluate each option:\n\nOption 1: Continue LEFT. Next head position (5,2). Is (5,2) a wall? No. Is it a body part (S)? Let's check. The current S positions are as listed. (5,2) is a space (from the board row 5: \"#S HS  #\"), so (5,2) is empty. So moving left here is safe. Then, after moving, the snake's head is at (5,2), and the body would follow. But since the snake's length is determined by how many apples it's eaten, but the initial length is 1. Each apple increases length by 1. Let's count the apples. The current board has apples at (1,4), (3,4), (4,5). So 3 apples. The snake's current length: initial 1, plus 3 apples, so length 4? Or maybe more. Let's think. The snake's body is made of S's. The head is H, and the body is S. So the number of S's plus 1 (H) is the current length. Let's count the S's:\n\nRow 2: 4 S's (columns 1-4)\nRow 3: 1 S (column 1)\nRow 4: 1 S (column 1)\nRow 5: 2 S's (columns 1 and 4)\nRow 6: 4 S's (columns 1-4)\nTotal S's: 4+1+1+2+4=12. So H (1) + 12 S's = length 13. So the snake has eaten 12 apples (since initial length 1, each apple adds 1, so 1+12=13).\n\nSo the snake's body is 12 segments. When moving, the snake's head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So when moving, the tail (last segment) will move only if the snake doesn't grow. But if the head moves to an apple, the snake grows (so tail doesn't move, adding a new segment).\n\nNow, the next positions:\n\nIf direction is LEFT: head moves to (5,2). Check if that's an apple. The current cell (5,2) is a space (no A), so no apple. So the snake moves, and the tail (the last S) will move forward. So the new body positions would be: the old head (5,3) becomes S, and the tail (which was the last S in the body) is removed. But I'm not sure exactly where the tail is. Alternatively, the snake's body is a sequence of positions. Let's think of the snake's body as a list, with the head at the front. So the current head is (5,3), direction LEFT. The previous position (before the last move) was (5,4), which is S. Then the next in the body would be (5,5) if it's part of the body, but (5,5) is a space, so perhaps (5,4) is followed by (6,4), which is S. Let's try to reconstruct the snake's body path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snake is arranged in a way that the body is in a loop. Let's think about the possible movement. The current direction is LEFT, so the head is moving left. The previous head position was (5,4) (since (5,4) is S now, which was the head before the last move). Then before that, the head was at (5,5), but (5,5) is a space, so maybe not. Alternatively, the snake could have been moving up or down.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to check possible next moves for collision.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\nPossible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN (since RIGHT is reverse of LEFT, which is not allowed).\n\n1. LEFT: next head position (5,2). Check if (5,2) is a wall: no. Check if (5,2) is S (body): current board at (5,2) is space, so no. So safe. Then, after moving, the head is at (5,2), the old head (5,3) becomes S, and the tail (the last S) is removed (since no apple was eaten). So the snake remains the same length. But need to check if moving here leads to any future issues, but maybe there's an apple nearby.\n\n2. UP: direction UP. The current direction is LEFT, so turning UP is allowed (not reverse). Next head position: (4,3). Let's check (4,3). The current row 4 is \"#S    A#\", so columns: 0 is #, 1 is S, 2-4 are spaces (columns 2,3,4), column 5 is A, column 6 is #. So (4,3) is a space (row 4, column 3). Is that a body part? Current S positions: (4,1) is S, (4,3) is space, so (4,3) is safe. So moving up to (4,3) is possible. Check if (4,3) is an apple: no, apple in row 4 is at (4,5). So no apple eaten. Then the head moves to (4,3), old head (5,3) becomes S, tail is removed. Safe.\n\n3. DOWN: direction DOWN. Next head position (6,3). Check (6,3). Row 6 is \"#SSSS  #\", so columns 1-4 are S. (6,3) is S (since columns 1-4 are S). So (6,3) is part of the snake's body. So moving down would cause the head to collide with the body. That's a game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT and UP. Now, which is better? Let's check for apples.\n\nThe current apples are at (1,4), (3,4), (4,5). Let's see where the snake can reach those.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (5,2), then next possible moves. The next direction could be LEFT again (to (5,1)), but (5,1) is S (current row 5, column 1 is S). So moving left again would hit the body. So (5,1) is S, so (5,2) moving left to (5,1) is collision. So after moving LEFT to (5,2), the next direction options would be UP or DOWN (since can't reverse to RIGHT). Let's see: (5,2) moving UP would be (4,2). (4,2) is space (row 4: \"#S    A#\" column 2 is space). So (4,2) is safe. Then, perhaps towards (4,5) which is an apple.\n\nIf we go UP to (4,3), then next possible directions. The current direction would be UP. So possible directions would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since can't reverse to DOWN). Let's see (4,3) moving UP again would be (3,3). Row 3 is \"#S  A  #\", column 3 is space (since row 3: column 1 is S, columns 2-3 are spaces, column 4 is A). So (3,3) is space. Then, (3,3) moving towards (3,4) which is an apple. That's a good path. So moving UP might lead towards the apple at (3,4).\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,2), then possible directions. Let's think about the apple positions. The apple at (4,5) is in row 4, column 5. To reach that, the snake would need to move right. But current direction after moving LEFT would be LEFT. So to turn right, the snake would have to first change direction to UP or DOWN, then to RIGHT. For example, from (5,2) (direction LEFT), next direction could be UP (to (4,2)), then direction RIGHT (since current direction is UP, can turn RIGHT). Then from (4,2) moving RIGHT to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) which is the apple. That's possible.\n\nBut let's check the apple at (3,4). If we go UP from (5,3) to (4,3), then direction is UP. Then next move UP to (3,3), then direction RIGHT (since current direction is UP, can turn RIGHT). Then from (3,3) moving RIGHT to (3,4), which is the apple. That's a direct path. So moving UP now could get to that apple in two steps.\n\nSo moving UP seems better because it's a path towards an apple. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head at (5,3). Direction UP: next head (4,3). Then, if direction remains UP (since possible), next head (3,3). Then, direction RIGHT (since can't reverse from UP to DOWN, but can turn RIGHT). Then head (3,4) which is the apple. So that's two moves to reach that apple. That's a good plan.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (5,2), then next direction could be UP to (4,2), then RIGHT to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) (apple). That's three moves. So UP is better.\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any immediate dangers. For example, if moving UP, (4,3) is safe. Then (3,3) is safe, etc. So no collisions. So the best direction is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#SSSS  #\n#S  A  #\n#S    A#\n#S HS  #\n#SSSS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 3) (row 5, column 3), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible next directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (RIGHT is invalid as it is the reverse of LEFT).\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (5, 2). This cell is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe. However, this direction does not immediately lead toward any apples, and subsequent moves may require more steps to reach an apple.\n\n2. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (4, 3). This cell is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe. From (4, 3), the snake can continue moving UP to (3, 3), then turn RIGHT to reach the apple at (3, 4) in the next move. This path directly leads toward an apple, making it optimal.\n\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (6, 3). However, (6, 3) is occupied by the snake's body ('S'), causing a collision. This direction is invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe safest and most optimal direction to reach an apple quickly is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let me start by visualizing the board. The board is 8x8 with walls as #. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #    A # (so columns 0 is #, 1-3 are spaces, 4 is A, 5 is space, 6 is #, 7 is #)\nRow 2: #SSS   # (columns 1-3 are S, 4-6 are spaces, 7 is #)\nRow 3: #S  A  # (column 1 is S, 2-3 spaces, 4 is A, 5-6 spaces, 7 is #)\nRow 4: #S H  A# (column 1 is S, 2 is space, 3 is H (head), 4-5 spaces, 6 is A, 7 is #)\nRow 5: #S SS  # (column 1 is S, 2 is space, 3-4 are S, 5-6 spaces, 7 is #)\nRow 6: #SSSS  # (column 1-4 are S, 5-6 spaces, 7 is #)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head is at row 4, column 3 (since row 4 is \"#S H  A#\", so H is at position (4,3) if we index rows from 0 to 7 and columns 0 to 7). \n\nThe snake's body is made of S's. Let's map all the S positions. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 2: columns 1,2,3 (SSS)\nRow 3: column 1 (S)\nRow 4: column 1 (S)\nRow 5: column 1 (S), columns 3,4 (SS)\nRow 6: columns 1,2,3,4 (SSSS)\n\nSo the snake's body is spread out. The head is at (4,3). The current direction is UP, which means the next move would be to (3,3) if we continue moving UP. Let's check that position.\n\nRow 3 is \"#S  A  #\". Column 3 in row 3: row 3, column 3 is a space. So if the snake moves UP (from (4,3) to (3,3)), that's a space. But we need to check if that's a valid move (not hitting a wall or itself).\n\nBut wait, the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is UP, so the snake can't immediately go DOWN. The possible directions the player can input are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse of UP, which is not allowed). So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, the rules say: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So current direction is UP. So possible next directions are UP (continue), LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is reverse, so not allowed.\n\nSo possible directions to choose from: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible direction:\n\n1. Direction UP: Next head position is (3,3). Let's check what's there. Row 3 is \"#S  A  #\". Column 3 is the 4th character (since index starts at 0). So row 3, column 3: yes, it's a space (since row 3 is \"# S  A  #\", breaking down: column 0: #, 1:S, 2: space, 3: space, 4:A, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #). So (3,3) is a space. So moving UP here would be safe. But then, after moving, the snake's head is at (3,3). The previous head (4,3) becomes part of the body (since the snake's length is more than 1; when it moves, the tail might stay if it ate an apple, but in normal movement, the tail moves. Wait, the example shows that when the snake eats an apple, it grows. So if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward (so the body shifts). If it does eat, the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases by 1.\n\nSo, in current scenario, if the next move (UP to (3,3)) is a space (no apple), then the snake's body would shift: the head moves to (3,3), and the tail (the last S) would be removed. But we need to check if the new head position is safe (not hitting body or wall). (3,3) is a space, not a wall (walls are at edges), and not S. So that's safe.\n\n2. Direction LEFT: Next head position is (4,2). Let's check (4,2). Row 4 is \"#S H  A#\". So column 2: between S (column 1) and H (column 3). So column 2 is a space. So (4,2) is a space. So moving LEFT would take the head to (4,2). Check if that's safe. (4,2) is a space, not S or wall. So safe.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT: Next head position is (4,4). Let's check (4,4). Row 4 is \"#S H  A#\". So column 4: after H (column 3) is space (column 4) and then A (column 6). So (4,4) is a space. So (4,4) is a space. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,4), which is a space. Safe.\n\nBut wait, are there any apples in the next positions? Let's check:\n\nCurrent apples are in the board. Let's list all A positions. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 1: column 4 (A)\nRow 3: column 4 (A)\nRow 4: column 6 (A)\n\nSo:\n\n- If moving UP to (3,3): (3,3) is space, no apple. So no growth, tail moves.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (4,2): (4,2) is space, no apple.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,4): (4,4) is space, no apple.\n\nHmm. So none of the immediate next positions have an apple. So the next move's main concern is avoiding collision in the future, perhaps. But maybe we need to look at where the snake is going and possible paths to apples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps check if any of the directions lead to a position that would cause a collision in the next steps. Let's think about the snake's body positions.\n\nThe snake's body (S's) are in the following positions (row, column):\n\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\nRow 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1)\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,3), (5,4)\nRow 6: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo the snake's body is mostly along the left side (columns 1-4) in rows 2-6. The head is at (4,3), which is in row 4, column 3.\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (3,3). Let's see the next possible moves. The direction after that could be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since current direction would be UP). The next position would be (2,3). (2,3) is S (row 2 has \"SSS   #\", so (2,3) is S). Oh, right! Because row 2, column 3 is part of the SSS in row 2. So (2,3) is S. So if the snake moves UP to (3,3) (current move), then in the next move (epoch 42), if it continues UP, the head would go to (2,3), which is S. That would cause a collision, ending the game. So moving UP now would lead to a possible collision next step if the snake continues in that direction.\n\nAlternatively, if after moving UP to (3,3), the snake could turn LEFT or RIGHT. Let's see.\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (3,3) (current direction becomes UP, since the input is UP). Then next epoch, the possible directions are UP (can't, because (2,3) is S), LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nIf direction LEFT from (3,3), the new head is (3,2). (3,2) is a space (row 3: \"#S  A  #\", column 2 is space). That's safe. So maybe that's okay.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP is risky because the next step might hit the body.\n\nWhat about moving LEFT? Current head at (4,3). Moving LEFT would take it to (4,2). Let's check (4,2): row 4 is \"#S H  A#\", so (4,2) is space. Safe. Then, the next direction could be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since current direction would be LEFT now, so can't reverse to RIGHT).\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT to (4,2), then next possible directions are LEFT (can't reverse to RIGHT), UP, or DOWN (but current direction is LEFT, so possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. Wait, no. The rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if the current direction after moving LEFT is LEFT, then the next direction can't be RIGHT. So possible directions would be LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nWait, the direction input is the direction the snake is moving. So when the player inputs a direction, the snake changes direction to that (if allowed). So, if the current direction is UP, and the player inputs LEFT, then the new direction is LEFT (since LEFT is not the reverse of UP). So the snake's movement direction becomes LEFT. Then, next move, the snake moves in LEFT direction. So the next head position would be (4,1) (since current head is (4,2), moving LEFT would be (4,1)). (4,1) is S (row 4: \"#S H  A#\", column 1 is S). Oh! (4,1) is part of the snake's body. So if the snake moves LEFT now (to (4,2)), then in the next step, moving LEFT again would hit (4,1), which is S. That's a collision.\n\nSo moving LEFT now (epoch 41) would take the head to (4,2). Then, if in epoch 42, the direction is LEFT again, the head moves to (4,1) which is S, causing collision. So that's a problem. Unless the player changes direction in epoch 42.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT. Let's check. Current head (4,3) moving RIGHT would go to (4,4). (4,4) is space. Then, the direction becomes RIGHT (since input is RIGHT). Next move (epoch 42) would be to (4,5). Let's check (4,5) in row 4: \"#S H  A#\", so column 5 is space. So (4,5) is space. Then, in epoch 43, moving RIGHT again would take to (4,6), which is A (since row 4 has A at column 6). So if the snake moves RIGHT now, then next steps can reach the apple at (4,6). That's a good path.\n\nLet's outline the steps for moving RIGHT:\n\nEpoch 41: direction RIGHT. Head moves from (4,3) to (4,4). Safe (no collision). The body shifts (since no apple eaten), so the tail (the last S) is removed. Let's assume the tail was at (6,4) (since row 6 has SSSS: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)), so after moving, the tail would be (6,1) perhaps? But maybe that's not necessary. The key is that the next positions are safe.\n\nEpoch 42: direction RIGHT. Head moves to (4,5). Safe.\n\nEpoch 43: direction RIGHT. Head moves to (4,6). That's the apple (A). So the snake eats it, grows by 1, score increases. Then, the new head is (4,6), and the body doesn't lose the tail, so the snake's length increases. That's a good outcome.\n\nSo moving RIGHT now (epoch 41) allows the snake to reach the apple at (4,6) in two moves. That's a better option than moving UP or LEFT, which may lead to collisions.\n\nSo the best direction is RIGHT.\n\n\n########\n#    A #\n#SSS   #\n#S  A  #\n#S H  A#\n#S SS  #\n#SSSS  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current state:\n\n- **Snake Head Position**: (4,3) (row 4, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: UP. The snake cannot reverse to DOWN, so possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n- **Apple Positions**: (1,4), (3,4), (4,6).\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Next head position is (3,3). This is a safe space (no collision with walls or body). However, continuing UP would lead to (2,3) in the next move, which is occupied by the snake’s body (row 2 has \"SSS   #\", so (2,3) is an 'S'). This risks collision in the following step.\n\n2. **LEFT**: Next head position is (4,2). This is a safe space. However, moving LEFT again would take the head to (4,1) (row 4 has \"#S H  A#\", so (4,1) is an 'S'), causing a collision with the snake’s body.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Next head position is (4,4). This is a safe space. Continuing RIGHT would lead to (4,5) (safe) and then (4,6) (the apple at (4,6)). Eating this apple would grow the snake and increase the score, with no immediate collision risk.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to safely approach and eat the apple at (4,6) in subsequent moves, avoiding collisions. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided. \n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls (#######) around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #    A # → positions (1,1) to (1,6): spaces, then A at (1,5)\nRow 2: #SS    # → SS at (2,1), (2,2); rest spaces\nRow 3: #S  A  # → S at (3,1); A at (3,4)\nRow 4: #S SH A# → Let's check each position. Columns 1 to 6. So (4,1)=S, (4,2)=S, (4,3)=H (head), (4,4)= space? Wait, wait, let's break down row 4: \"#S SH A#\" → indexes 0 is #, 1 is S, 2 is space, 3 is S, 4 is H, 5 is A, 6 is #. Oh, wait, maybe I need to count the characters properly. Let's list each row's columns from 0 to 7 (since it's 8 characters, 0-7 inclusive):\n\nRow 0: 0: #, 1: #, 2: #, 3: #, 4: #, 5: #, 6: #, 7: #\nRow 1: 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 2: 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 3: 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 4: 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'H', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 5: 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 6: 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 7: 0: #, 1: #, 2: #, 3: #, 4: #, 5: #, 6: #, 7: #\n\nWait, maybe I should index each cell as (row, column), where row 0 is top, column 0 is left. Let's confirm the head position. The head is 'H', so looking through the rows:\n\nRow 4: \"#S SH A#\" → Let's split the characters: positions 0 is #, 1 is S, 2 is space, 3 is S, 4 is H, 5 is A, 6 is space, 7 is #. So H is at (4,4). That's the head's current position.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right. So the next move, if direction remains RIGHT, the head would move to (4,5) (since moving right increases column by 1). Let's check (4,5): in row 4, column 5 is 'A' (apple). So if the snake moves RIGHT, it will eat the apple at (4,5). That's good because it increases the score and the snake grows. But we need to check if that move is safe. \n\nWait, but we also need to check for collisions. Let's see where the body is. The body is 'S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2)\nRow 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,3)\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,2)\nRow 6: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo when the snake moves RIGHT to (4,5), is that cell occupied by the body? (4,5) is A, so no. So that's safe. Also, (4,5) is within the board (columns 0-7, 5 is okay, rows 0-7, 4 is okay). So no wall collision. So moving RIGHT would be safe, and eat the apple. That's a good move.\n\nBut wait, what are the possible directions the player can choose? The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is RIGHT. So the snake can't go LEFT (reverse). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Because reversing from RIGHT is LEFT, which is not allowed. So the possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check the other possible directions. Let's see:\n\nIf the player chooses UP: moving UP would take the head from (4,4) to (3,4). What's at (3,4)? In row 3, column 4 is 'A' (apple). So moving UP would take the head to (3,4), which is an apple. Is that safe? Let's check (3,4): the cell is A, not a body part. The body parts in row 3 are (3,1). So (3,4) is safe. So moving UP would also eat an apple. \n\nIf the player chooses DOWN: moving DOWN from (4,4) would take the head to (5,4). Let's check (5,4). Row 5 is \"#S SS  #\", so columns 0-7: 0=#, 1=S, 2=S, 3= space, 4= space, 5= space, 6= space, 7=#. So (5,4) is a space. No apple there. But is that cell occupied by the body? The body in row 5 is (5,1), (5,2). So (5,4) is safe. But no apple, so the snake would just move there, and the tail would move (since length is more than 1, the tail would remove the last segment). \n\nSo possible options: RIGHT (apple at (4,5)), UP (apple at (3,4)), DOWN (no apple). Which is better?\n\nBut wait, the snake's current direction is RIGHT. The snake moves in the direction given. So if the direction is UP, then the next move is UP. Let's check if the UP direction is allowed (since current direction is RIGHT, turning UP is allowed, as it's not reversing). Reversing would be if current direction is RIGHT and trying to go LEFT. So UP is allowed.\n\nSo, which direction is better? Let's check if moving UP or RIGHT leads to any immediate danger.\n\nFirst, moving RIGHT: next head position (4,5). After eating the apple, the snake's length increases. The new head is (4,5), and the body would include the previous positions. The previous head was (4,4), which becomes S. Then the rest of the body follows. Let's imagine the new board after moving RIGHT. The apple at (4,5) is eaten, so that cell becomes H. The previous H (4,4) becomes S. The rest of the body shifts. So the new body would be all the previous S positions, plus (4,4). Since the snake grows by 1, the tail doesn't remove a segment. So the snake's length increases. That's safe.\n\nMoving UP: head moves to (3,4). That's an apple. So same as above, the snake eats it, grows. The previous head (4,4) becomes S, and the body shifts. (3,4) is now H. Let's check if (3,4) is adjacent to any body parts. The body in row 3 is (3,1). So (3,4) is far from that, so no collision. So that's safe.\n\nSo both UP and RIGHT directions would result in eating an apple. But which is better? Let's see the positions of other apples. The current apples are:\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are:\n\nRow 1, column 5: (1,5) → A\n\nRow 3, column 4: (3,4) → A (if not eaten)\n\nRow 4, column 5: (4,5) → A (if not eaten)\n\nSo in the current board, there are three apples. If we move RIGHT, we eat (4,5), which is one apple. If we move UP, we eat (3,4), another apple. Either is good. \n\nBut we need to check if moving in either direction could lead to a collision in the next steps. Let's think about the snake's body. The snake is quite long. Let's see the current body segments. Let's list all S and H positions (H is (4,4)):\n\nBody segments (S and H):\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,3), (4,4) [H], (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo the snake's body is in a sort of vertical line on the left side, with some parts branching out. The head is at (4,4), which is to the right of some of the body.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (4,5), next move's possible directions would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since can't reverse to LEFT). Let's say after moving RIGHT, the head is at (4,5). The next possible moves. If we move RIGHT again, the next position would be (4,6). Let's check (4,6) in the current board: row 4, column 6 is ' ' (space). So that's safe. But after that, maybe.\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (3,4), next possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since current direction would be UP, can't reverse to DOWN). Wait, no: the direction after moving UP would be UP, so the next possible directions can't be DOWN (reverse). So possible directions would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check (3,4) as the new head. The next move if direction is UP would go to (2,4). What's (2,4) in the current board? Row 2 is \"#SS    #\", so column 4 is ' ' (space). So (2,4) is safe. \n\nBut which direction gives more options? Maybe either is okay. But perhaps moving RIGHT is better because it's the current direction, and there's an apple there. Alternatively, maybe moving UP is better. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a collision I'm missing. Let's check for the current possible moves:\n\nCurrent head is at (4,4). Current direction is RIGHT. So if the player chooses RIGHT, the next head position is (4,5). Let's check if (4,5) is a wall or body. (4,5) is A (apple), not a wall (walls are at column 0 and 7, row 0 and 7). So (4,5) is within the board (row 4 is between 1-6, column 5 is between 1-6). So no wall collision. And (4,5) is not a body part (body parts are all the S positions listed earlier). So moving RIGHT is safe and will eat an apple. That's a good move. So the answer is RIGHT?\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#SS    #\n#S  A  #\n#S SH A#\n#S SS  #\n#SSSS  #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4).\n- The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n- The goal is to eat apples safely and avoid collisions.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **RIGHT Direction**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,5), which contains an apple ('A'). This position is within the board (no wall collision) and not occupied by the snake's body (all 'S' positions are elsewhere). Eating this apple will increase the score and grow the snake.\n2. **UP Direction**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,4), which also contains an apple. This is safe but less critical since RIGHT directly continues the current movement and also leads to an apple.\n3. **DOWN Direction**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (5,4), which is empty (no apple). This does not contribute to the score and is less optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is the best choice as it safely eats an apple, continues the current direction, and avoids collisions.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by analyzing the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls (marked with #). Let's list out each row to get a clear picture:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #    A # (so positions (1,1) to (1,6) are: ' ', ' ', ' ', 'A', ' ')\nRow 2: #S     # (positions (2,1) is 'S', others from (2,2) to (2,6) are ' ')\nRow 3: #S  A  # (positions (2,1) is 'S', (3,3) is 'A', others ' ')\nRow 4: #S SSHA# (Let's break this down: (4,1) 'S', (4,2) 'S', (4,3) 'S', (4,4) 'H', (4,5) 'A')\nRow 5: #S SS  # (positions (5,1) 'S', (5,2) 'S', (5,3) 'S', others ' ')\nRow 6: #SSSS  # (positions (6,1) 'S', (6,2) 'S', (6,3) 'S', (6,4) 'S', others ' ')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at position (4,4) (since rows are 0-7, columns 0-7, but the first and last are #, so the inner grid is rows 1-6, columns 1-6). Let's confirm the coordinates: row 4, column 4 (since row 4 is \"#S SSHA#\", so the characters are [0]#, [1]S, [2]S, [3]S, [4]H, [5]A, [6]#. So column 1 is index 1, column 4 is index 4. So H is at (4,4).\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right. The next move direction can't be the reverse of current direction. Since current direction is RIGHT, the snake can't go LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since you can continue in the same direction or turn, as long as it's not the reverse).\n\nNow, the snake's movement: when it moves, the head moves one square in the direction, and if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves (so the body follows). If it eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one.\n\nFirst, let's check where the head is now and possible next positions.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,4). Current direction is RIGHT, so moving right would take it to (4,5). Let's check what's at (4,5): in row 4, the string is \"#S SSHA#\", so index 5 is 'A' (since positions are 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4:H, 5:A, 6:#). So (4,5) is an apple. So if the snake moves RIGHT, the head will go to (4,5), which is an apple. Eating that apple would make the snake grow (so the tail doesn't move), and the score increases by 1. But we need to check if moving RIGHT would cause a collision.\n\nWait, the next position is (4,5). Let's check if that's a wall or a body part. (4,5) is within the inner grid (columns 1-6, row 1-6), so not a wall. Is there a body part there? The current board at (4,5) is 'A', so no. So moving RIGHT would eat the apple. That's good.\n\nBut wait, let's check other possible directions. Let's list possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since can't go LEFT).\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each:\n\n1. RIGHT: next head position (4,5). That's 'A' (apple). So snake eats it, grows. The new head is (4,5), and the body would extend. Since the snake was moving right, the previous head position (4,4) becomes 'S' (body part), and the new head is (4,5). The tail would not move (since apple is eaten). So this is a safe move, and gains a point.\n\n2. UP: moving up from (4,4) would go to (3,4). Let's check row 3: \"#S  A  #\". The characters are 0:#, 1:S, 2: ' ', 3:A, 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6:#. So (3,4) is ' ' (empty). Is there a body part there? Let's check the current board. Current body parts are 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1: no S.\nRow 2: (2,1) is S.\nRow 3: (3,1) is S.\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) are S.\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) are S.\nRow 6: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) are S.\n\nSo (3,4) is empty. So moving UP would take head to (3,4). That's safe. But there's no apple there, so the snake would move, and the tail would move (since no apple eaten). The snake's length remains the same. But need to check if (3,4) is a body part. No, as per the current positions. So UP is possible.\n\n3. DOWN: moving down from (4,4) would go to (5,4). Let's check row 5: \"#S SS  #\". The characters are 0:#, 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6:#. So (5,4) is ' ' (empty). Are there any S's there? Current S's in row 5 are (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). So (5,4) is empty. So moving DOWN is possible, but no apple there. So snake moves, tail moves.\n\nNow, the snake's goal is to eat as many apples as possible. So moving RIGHT would eat an apple, which is better. Let's confirm if moving RIGHT is safe. The next position (4,5) is an apple, not a wall or body. So no collision. So moving RIGHT is safe and gains a point.\n\nAre there any other apples on the board? Let's check the current board:\n\nRow 1: (1,4) is A (since row 1 is \"#    A #\", so columns 1-6: positions 1,2,3 are ' ', 4 is 'A', 5 is ' '). So (1,4) is A.\n\nRow 3: (3,3) is A (row 3 is \"#S  A  #\", columns 1:S, 2: ' ', 3:A, 4: ' ', 5: ' '). So (3,3) is A.\n\nRow 4: (4,5) is A (as we saw). So there are three apples, which matches the initial condition (starts with 3 apples). So moving RIGHT would eat the apple at (4,5), which is one of the existing apples.\n\nSo the best move here is to go RIGHT, eat the apple, increase the score, and grow the snake. Other directions don't eat an apple. So the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\n########\n#    A #\n#S     #\n#S  A  #\n#S SSHA#\n#S SS  #\n#SSSS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is currently at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4). The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (4,5), which contains an 'A' (apple). This is safe (no wall or self-collision) and will result in eating the apple, increasing the score by 1, and growing the snake.  \n- **UP**: Moving up would take the head to (3,4), which is empty. No apple is present here, so the snake would not grow, and the tail would shift.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (5,4), which is empty. No apple is present here, so the snake would not grow, and the tail would shift.  \n\nEating the apple by moving RIGHT is the optimal choice to maximize the score. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let me start by visualizing the board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls (the #). Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #    A # → So positions (1,1) to (1,6) are spaces, with an A at (1,4) maybe? Let's index rows from top (0) to bottom (7), and columns from left (0) to right (7). So row 1 is index 1. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 1: #    A # → columns 0 is #, 1-3 are spaces, 4 is A, 5 is space, 6 is #. So positions (1,4) is A.\n\nRow 2: #S     # → (2,1) is S, others (2,2-6) are spaces.\n\nRow 3: #S  A  # → (3,1) is S, (3,4) is A.\n\nRow 4: #S SSSH# → Let's check columns here. Column 0 is #, then (4,1)=S, (4,2)=space, (4,3)=S, (4,4)=S, (4,5)=S, (4,6)=H, (4,7)=#. Wait, row 4 is \"#S SSSH#\", so splitting into characters: [ '#', 'S', ' ', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'H', '#' ] → columns 1: S, 3: S, 4:S, 5:S, 6:H. So H is at (4,6). That's the head of the snake.\n\nRow 5: #S SS  # → (5,1)=S, (5,2)=space, (5,3)=S, (5,4)=S, (5,5)=space, (5,6)=space, (5,7)=#.\n\nRow 6: #SSSSA # → (6,1)=S, (6,2)=S, (6,3)=S, (6,4)=S, (6,5)=A, (6,6)=space, (6,7)=#.\n\nRow 7: ######## (all walls).\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at (4,6). The current direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right. Let's think about where the head will move next if we don't change direction. The next position would be (4,7), which is a wall (since row 4, column 7 is #). Oh, that's a collision with the wall! So if we keep moving RIGHT, the snake will hit the wall and the game ends. So we can't choose RIGHT.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is RIGHT, so the opposite direction is LEFT. So we can't turn LEFT (since that's reversing). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. But RIGHT is bad because of the wall. So options are UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check where UP and DOWN would take the head.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,6). \n\nIf direction is UP, the next position is (3,6). Let's check what's at (3,6). Looking at row 3: \"#S  A  #\". Row 3 has columns 0-7. So row 3, column 6: the row is \"#S  A  #\", which is characters: [ '#', 'S', ' ', ' ', 'A', ' ', ' ', '#' ] → column 6 is space (since 0 is #, 1:S, 2: space, 3: space, 4:A, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #). So (3,6) is a space. So moving UP to (3,6) would be safe. Are there any body parts there? Let's check if (3,6) is S. The row 3 is \"#S  A  #\", so columns 1 is S, 4 is A, others are spaces. So (3,6) is safe.\n\nIf direction is DOWN, next position is (5,6). Let's check row 5: \"#S SS  #\". So row 5, column 6 is space (since the row is [ '#', 'S', ' ', 'S', 'S', ' ', ' ', '#' ] → column 6 is space. So (5,6) is a space. So moving DOWN to (5,6) is safe.\n\nNow, we need to check if either of these directions leads to the snake colliding with its own body. Let's check the body positions.\n\nThe snake's body is all the S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 2, column 1: (2,1) → S\n\nRow 3, column 1: (3,1) → S\n\nRow 4, column 1: (4,1) → S\n\nRow 4, column 3: (4,3) → S\n\nRow 4, column 4: (4,4) → S\n\nRow 4, column 5: (4,5) → S (since H is at (4,6), the body is S's leading up to H. So (4,5) is S, (4,4) S, (4,3) S, (4,1) S. Also, row 5:\n\nRow 5, column 1: (5,1) → S\n\nRow 5, column 3: (5,3) → S\n\nRow 5, column 4: (5,4) → S\n\nRow 6, columns 1-4: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) → S's.\n\nSo let's check (3,6) (UP) and (5,6) (DOWN) for S. (3,6) is space. (5,6) is space. So both are safe.\n\nNow, are there apples in the next positions? Let's check. The apples are at (1,4), (3,4), (6,5). \n\nIf we go UP to (3,6), is there an apple there? (3,6) is space. So no.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (5,6), (5,6) is space. So no. So neither direction immediately eats an apple.\n\nBut we need to avoid walls and self-collision. Also, we need to think about the path ahead. Let's see the next moves.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT, which is bad. So possible directions are UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check if moving UP would lead to any issues. The next head position is (3,6). Then, the next direction could be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since the new direction can't reverse from UP, which would be DOWN). Let's see what's around (3,6):\n\nUp from (3,6) is (2,6). Row 2: \"#S     #\". So (2,6) is space (since row 2 is [ '#', 'S', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '#' ] → column 6 is space). So (2,6) is safe.\n\nRight from (3,6) would be (3,7), which is a wall. So that's bad. So if after moving UP, if the next direction is RIGHT, it would hit the wall. So maybe UP is okay, but need to plan.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,6). Then, the next possible directions are DOWN, UP, RIGHT (since current direction would be DOWN, can't reverse to UP). Let's check (5,6) next moves. Down from (5,6) is (6,6). Row 6: \"#SSSSA #\". (6,6) is space (since row 6 is [ '#', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'A', ' ', '#' ] → column 6 is space). So (6,6) is safe. Right from (5,6) is (5,7), which is a wall. So that's bad.\n\nSo both UP and DOWN are possible, but which is better? Let's see if there's any immediate danger. The snake's body is mostly on the left side, so moving right (original direction) is into a wall, so that's out. Moving up or down into the right side (columns 6) which are currently empty. Let's check if moving UP would have the snake's body in the next steps. Let's think about the snake's body positions. The body is a long chain on the left side (columns 1-4). The head is at (4,6), moving right. So the right side (columns 5,6) are mostly empty except for the head.\n\nSo moving UP (to 3,6) is safe. Moving DOWN (to 5,6) is also safe. Are there any apples in the vicinity that we can reach?\n\nThe apples are at (1,4), (3,4), (6,5). Let's see. The head is at (4,6). To reach (3,4), which is an apple, the head would need to move left. But current direction is RIGHT, and we can't reverse to LEFT. So if we turn UP, then maybe next direction can be LEFT (if possible). Wait, direction changes can be made as long as it's not reversing. So if current direction is UP, then next direction can be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (can't be DOWN). So moving UP, then LEFT could take the head towards (3,5), (3,4), which is an apple. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head (4,6). If we choose UP, head moves to (3,6). Then, if next direction is LEFT (since current direction is UP, can turn LEFT), then head moves to (3,5). (3,5) is space (row 3: \"#S  A  #\" → column 5 is space). Then next direction LEFT again (from UP, can turn LEFT), head moves to (3,4), which is the apple at (3,4). That would be good. So that's a possible path to an apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose DOWN, head moves to (5,6). Then, direction can be LEFT (since current direction is DOWN, can turn LEFT). Then head moves to (5,5), which is space (row 5: \"#S SS  #\" → column 5 is space). Then LEFT again to (5,4), which is S (since row 5, column 4 is S). Oh, that's a problem. (5,4) is part of the snake's body, so moving to (5,4) would cause a collision. So if we go DOWN, then LEFT, we hit the body. So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,6), direction could be DOWN, moving to (6,6). Then, (6,6) is space, then maybe direction LEFT to (6,5), which is the apple at (6,5). That's a good path. Let's check:\n\nHead at (4,6) → direction DOWN → (5,6). Then direction DOWN → (6,6). Then direction LEFT → (6,5) (which is A). So that's possible. (6,5) is the apple. So moving DOWN, then DOWN, then LEFT would reach the apple.\n\nSo both UP and DOWN could lead to apples, but need to check if the path is clear.\n\nLet's compare the two options:\n\nOption 1: UP → (3,6). Then possible to go LEFT towards (3,4) apple. The path from (3,6) to (3,4) is (3,6) → (3,5) → (3,4). (3,5) is space, (3,4) is A. So that's two moves. So if we choose UP now, then next direction LEFT, then LEFT again, we can reach the apple.\n\nOption 2: DOWN → (5,6). Then DOWN → (6,6). Then LEFT → (6,5) (A). That's also two moves. (6,5) is an apple.\n\nSo both options can reach apples in two steps. But which path is safer? Let's check the body positions.\n\nFor UP path: (3,6) → (3,5) → (3,4). (3,4) is the apple. The body in row 3 is at (3,1) (S), so (3,2-3) are spaces, (3,4) is A, (3,5-6) are spaces. So that path is clear.\n\nFor DOWN path: (5,6) → (6,6) → (6,5). (6,5) is A. The row 6 has S's at (6,1-4), (6,5) is A, (6,6) is space. So (6,6) is safe, then (6,5) is A. That's clear.\n\nSo both paths are possible. Are there any other factors? Let's check the current snake's body. The snake is quite long, so we need to avoid getting stuck. Let's see the current snake's body structure. The snake's body seems to be forming a sort of loop on the left side. The head is on the right, so moving up or down might allow the snake to navigate around.\n\nAnother thing: the current direction is RIGHT. If we choose UP, the direction changes from RIGHT to UP. Since the snake can't reverse, that's allowed (UP is not the reverse of RIGHT). Similarly, DOWN is allowed.\n\nSo which direction to choose? Let's see if any of the options would lead to immediate collision. Both UP and DOWN are safe. Since the problem is to choose the best direction, perhaps either is acceptable, but let's check if there's any other apples or possible collisions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one direction has more space. Let's check the positions:\n\nAfter moving UP to (3,6), the next positions to the left are (3,5), (3,4), etc. Those are all empty except for the apple at (3,4).\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (5,6), next positions down to (6,6), then left to (6,5) (apple). That's also clear.\n\nSince both directions are safe, but perhaps the answer is to choose one of them. Let's pick UP. Because if we go UP, then the next move can be left towards the apple at (3,4), which is in row 3, column 4. That's a valid path. Alternatively, DOWN could lead to (6,5) apple, which is also valid.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects to avoid the wall. Since current direction is RIGHT, which leads to wall (4,7). So the only valid directions are UP or DOWN. Since the question requires to pick one, perhaps either is correct, but let's think again.\n\nWait, let's recheck the head position. The head is at (4,6). Current direction is RIGHT. So the next position if moving RIGHT is (4,7), which is a wall. So RIGHT is invalid. So the possible directions are UP, DOWN (since can't reverse to LEFT). So the answer must be either UP or DOWN.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better option. Let's check the snake's body. Are there any S's in the positions we are moving into? For UP: (3,6) is space. For DOWN: (5,6) is space. So both are safe. So either is acceptable. But the example in the problem statement shows that when moving in a direction that eats an apple, the snake grows. But in this case, neither direction immediately eats an apple, but they set up for future apples.\n\nThe problem asks to choose the direction. Since the user is to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, and RIGHT is invalid (wall), LEFT is reverse (invalid), so options are UP or DOWN.\n\nIn such cases, perhaps either is acceptable, but maybe one is better. Let's check if moving UP would lead to a position where the next move can't proceed. For example, if after moving UP, the next direction is LEFT, which is allowed (since current direction is UP, can turn LEFT). Then moving LEFT to (3,5), then LEFT again to (3,4) (apple). That's a good path. So UP is a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6), then DOWN to (6,6), then LEFT to (6,5) (apple). Also good. So both are possible.\n\nBut perhaps the answer is UP. Let's go with UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#S     #\n#S  A  #\n#S SSSH#\n#S SS  #\n#SSSSA #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,6) (row 4, column 6), and the current direction is RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,7), which is a wall (collision), so RIGHT is invalid. Reversing direction to LEFT is not allowed. Thus, the valid directions are UP or DOWN.\n\n- **UP**: The head would move to (3,6). Checking (3,6) on the board (row 3: \"#S  A  #\"), this position is empty (no wall or snake body), so it is safe. This direction allows the snake to potentially move left toward the apple at (3,4) in subsequent moves.\n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (5,6). Checking (5,6) on the board (row 5: \"#S SS  #\"), this position is empty (no wall or snake body), so it is also safe. This direction could lead the snake toward the apple at (6,5) in subsequent moves.\n\nBoth UP and DOWN are safe, but UP is chosen to avoid potential conflicts with the snake's body in the lower rows and to position the head closer to the apple at (3,4).\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board given is:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#S  A H#\n#S SSSS#\n#S SS  #\n#SSSSA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the epoch is 45 (so we have 55 epochs left before the game ends). The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. Let's locate the head first. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #    A # → positions 1-6: [space, space, space, A, space]\nRow 2: #      # → all spaces except walls\nRow 3: #S  A H# → positions 1: S, 2: space, 3: A, 4: H. So the head 'H' is at (3,4) (row 3, column 4). Because rows are 0-indexed, row 3 is the fourth line. Let's confirm coordinates: (row, column), with row 0 being top. So the head is at (3,4).\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. When moving up, the next position of the head would be (2,4) (since moving up decreases the row number by 1). Let's check what's in (2,4). The row 2 is \"#      #\", so columns 1-6 are all spaces. So (2,4) is a space. But wait, the snake's body is made of 'S's. Let's check if (2,4) is part of the snake's body. Let's list all the 'S' positions.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 3: #S  A H# → (3,1) is S.\nRow 4: #S SSSS# → (4,1) is S, (4,2) is S, (4,3) is S, (4,4) is S, (4,5) is S. So positions (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\nRow 5: #S SS  # → (5,1) is S, (5,2) is S, (5,3) is S. So (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).\nRow 6: #SSSSA # → (6,1) is S, (6,2) is S, (6,3) is S, (6,4) is S. So (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\nSo the snake's body is at:\n\n(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\nThe head is at (3,4). So the next position if moving UP is (2,4). Is (2,4) part of the body? No, because all the 'S's are in rows 3,4,5,6. So (2,4) is a safe space. But maybe there's an apple there? Let's check row 2: \"#      #\", which has no 'A's. So moving up would take the head to (2,4), which is empty. The snake would move, the tail would move (since length is current length, which we need to check. The initial length is 1, but each apple increases length. Let's count apples. The board has 'A's in row 1 (position 4), row 3 (position 3), row 6 (position 5). So 3 apples. The snake has eaten some? The current board shows 'A's, so perhaps the snake hasn't eaten all yet. The snake's current length is 1 (initial) plus number of apples eaten. Let's count the 'S's and 'H'. The head is 1, body 'S's: let's count all 'S's. \n\nRow 3: 1 S (3,1)\nRow 4: 5 S's (positions 1-5)\nRow 5: 3 S's (positions 1-3)\nRow 6: 4 S's (positions 1-4)\nTotal S's: 1+5+3+4=13. Plus H: 1. So total length is 14. Since initial length is 1, that means the snake has eaten 13 apples (since each apple increases length by 1). But the current board has 3 apples left. So 13 eaten, 3 remaining.\n\nNow, the possible directions. The current direction is UP. The snake can't reverse direction, so the next direction can't be DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse). \n\nWe need to choose a direction that avoids collision with walls or body, and preferably moves towards apples.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. UP: Next head position is (2,4). As before, (2,4) is empty (no walls, no S). So safe. Then, after moving, the tail (the last S) would be removed if no apple is eaten. But if (2,4) is not an apple, the snake moves, and the tail (the last S) is removed. Let's check if (2,4) is an apple. The current apples are at row 1, column 4 (row 1: \"#    A # → (1,4) is A). Row 3, column 3: (3,3) is A. Row 6, column 5: (6,5) is A. So (2,4) is not an apple. So moving up would just move the head to (2,4), and the tail (the last S in the body) would be removed. The snake's length remains 14 (since no apple eaten).\n\n2. LEFT: Direction is LEFT. The current direction is UP, so LEFT is allowed (not reverse). Moving LEFT would mean the head moves from (3,4) to (3,3). Let's check (3,3): in row 3, the cell is 'A' (since row 3 is \"#S  A H#\" → positions 1:S, 2: space, 3:A, 4:H). So (3,3) is an apple. So if we move LEFT, the head moves to (3,3), which is an apple. Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows by 1 (so length becomes 15). The tail does not get removed (since when eating an apple, the snake grows, so the tail stays). So this would be good, as we get an apple. Also, we need to check if (3,3) is part of the body. The body S's are at (3,1), (4,1), etc. (3,3) is A, not S, so no collision. So moving LEFT would result in eating an apple. That's a good move.\n\n3. RIGHT: Direction is RIGHT. The head is at (3,4). Moving RIGHT would take it to (3,5). Let's check (3,5). The row 3 is \"#S  A H#\" → columns 0 is #, 1:S, 2: space, 3:A, 4:H, 5: space, 6: #. So (3,5) is space. Is that part of the body? The body S's are in (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), etc. (3,5) is space, so no collision. So moving RIGHT is safe. But (3,5) is not an apple, so no score gain.\n\n4. DOWN: Reverse direction of current (UP → DOWN is reverse), so not allowed. So can't choose DOWN.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Among these, moving LEFT would allow the snake to eat an apple (since (3,3) is A). That's the best option. Let's confirm: moving LEFT, head moves to (3,3) which is A. No collision (since (3,3) is not S or #). So this is safe and gains a point. So the best direction is LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#S  A H#\n#S SSSS#\n#S SS  #\n#SSSSA #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state:\n- **Head position**: (3, 4) (row 3, column 4).\n- **Current direction**: UP. The snake cannot reverse direction, so DOWN is invalid.\n- **Apples**: Located at (1, 4), (3, 3), and (6, 5).\n- **Body positions**: All 'S' cells are in rows 3-6, columns 1-5 (no overlap with potential new head positions except if moving into body).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Next head position is (2, 4). This cell is empty (no walls, body, or apples). Safe but no apple eaten.\n2. **LEFT**: Next head position is (3, 3), which contains an apple ('A'). No collision (cell is not a wall or body). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake.\n3. **RIGHT**: Next head position is (3, 5). This cell is empty (no walls, body, or apples). Safe but no apple eaten.\n4. **DOWN**: Reverse of current direction (UP → DOWN), invalid.\n\n**Best choice**: Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score and growing the snake without collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #    A # (so positions (1,1) to (1,6) are: ' ', ' ', ' ', 'A', ' ', ' ')\nRow 2: #      # (all spaces except walls)\nRow 3: #   AHS# → positions (3,1)= ' ', (3,2)=' ', (3,3)='A', (3,4)='H', (3,5)='S'\nRow 4: #S SSSS# → (4,1)='S', (4,2)=' ', (4,3)='S', (4,4)='S', (4,5)='S', (4,6)='S'\nRow 5: #S SS  # → (5,1)='S', (5,2)=' ', (5,3)='S', (5,4)='S', (5,5)=' ', (5,6)=' '\nRow 6: #SSSSA # → (6,1)='S', (6,2)='S', (6,3)='S', (6,4)='S', (6,5)='A', (6,6)=' '\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake's head is at (3,4) (since H is in row 3, column 4; assuming rows are 0-7 and columns 0-7, with (row, column) notation). Let's confirm the positions. Wait, in grid terms, the first character is row 0, column 0. So for row 3: \"#   AHS#\", the characters are:\ncolumns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: 'H', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'? Wait, no. Each row is 8 characters. Let's index columns 0-7.\n\nRow 3: \"#   AHS#\" → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: 'H', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'? Wait, let's count the characters. \"#   AHS#\" is 8 characters. Let's list them:\n\nRow 3 (index 3):\ncol 0: '#'\ncol 1: ' ' (space)\ncol 2: ' ' (space)\ncol 3: 'A' (apple)\ncol 4: 'H' (head)\ncol 5: 'S' (body)\ncol 6: ' ' (space)\ncol 7: '#'\n\nSo head is at (3,4). Current direction is LEFT. Moving LEFT means the next position of the head would be (3,3), since moving left decreases the column by 1. Let's check (3,3): that's 'A' (an apple). So if we move LEFT, the head goes to (3,3), which is an apple. Then, the snake eats the apple, grows in length. The current body positions need to be considered to avoid collision.\n\nBut wait, we need to check if moving LEFT is possible. The snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is LEFT. The possible directions the player can input are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. But the snake can't reverse direction. Wait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So, if current direction is LEFT, the player can't input RIGHT (since that's the reverse). So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. Because RIGHT is the opposite direction of LEFT, so it's not allowed.\n\nSo possible directions to choose are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nNow, let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT: next head position (3,3). Let's check what's there. (3,3) is 'A' (apple). So eating it. Now, we need to check if (3,3) is a wall or the snake's body. (3,3) is not a wall (walls are at columns 0 and 7, rows 0 and 7). The current body positions: Let's list all 'S' positions.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 4: #S SSSS# → columns 1: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S' (since columns 0 is '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#') → positions (4,1), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n\nRow 5: #S SS  # → columns 1: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S' → positions (5,1), (5,3), (5,4).\n\nRow 6: #SSSSA # → columns 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S' → positions (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\nRow 3: (3,5) is 'S' → (3,5).\n\nSo body positions are:\n\n(3,5), (4,1), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,1), (5,3), (5,4), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\nHead is at (3,4). Moving LEFT to (3,3). Is (3,3) in the body positions? Let's check: (3,3) is 'A' in the current board, which is not 'S', so it's safe. So moving LEFT would be safe. The snake would eat the apple, grow, and the new head is (3,3), and the body would follow. Since the snake was moving LEFT, the body parts will shift. Since it's growing, the tail doesn't shrink. So this direction is possible.\n\n2. UP: current direction is LEFT. Turning UP is allowed (since UP is not the reverse of LEFT). The next head position would be (2,4) (since moving UP decreases the row by 1). Let's check (2,4). Row 2 is \"#      #\", so column 4 in row 2 is ' ' (space). So (2,4) is empty. Now, check if (2,4) is a wall: row 2 is between 0 and 7, column 4 is between 0 and 7. So not a wall. Is (2,4) part of the snake's body? Let's check the body positions listed earlier. None of the body positions are (2,4), so moving UP is safe.\n\n3. DOWN: current direction is LEFT. Turning DOWN is allowed (not reverse). Next head position is (4,4). Let's check (4,4). Looking at row 4: #S SSSS# → column 4 is 'S' (body part). So (4,4) is part of the snake's body. So moving DOWN would cause a collision with itself, which ends the game. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT and UP. Now, we need to choose between them. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible. Let's see where the apples are.\n\nCurrent apples are at:\n\nRow 1, column 3 (since row 1 is \"#    A #\", columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'? Wait, row 1: \"#    A #\". Let's count the characters. \"#    A #\" is 8 characters. So columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (1,4) is 'A'.\n\nRow 3, column 3: (3,3) is 'A' (as earlier).\n\nRow 6, column 5: (6,5) is 'A' (row 6: \"#SSSSA #\", columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#') → (6,5) is 'A'.\n\nSo three apples at (1,4), (3,3), (6,5).\n\nIf we move LEFT, the head goes to (3,3) which is an apple. So that's good, we get a point. The snake grows. Then, the next move would have the new head at (3,3), direction would be LEFT (since we continued moving LEFT).\n\nIf we move UP, the head goes to (2,4). Then, the next direction could be any except the reverse (which would be DOWN, since current direction would be UP). But moving UP now would take us away from the apple at (3,3), but maybe towards (1,4). Let's see.\n\nBut in the current situation, moving LEFT allows us to eat an apple immediately, which is better for the score. Also, moving UP to (2,4) is safe, but doesn't get an apple. So the optimal choice here is to move LEFT, eat the apple, and grow the snake. So the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   AHS#\n#S SSSS#\n#S SS  #\n#SSSSA #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head ('H') is at (row 3, column 4).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so RIGHT is invalid.\n- **Apples**: Three apples are present at (row 1, column 4), (row 3, column 3), and (row 6, column 5).\n- **Body Positions**: The snake's body ('S') occupies multiple positions, including (3,5), (4,1), (4,3-6), (5,1), (5,3-4), and (6,1-4).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 3, column 3), which contains an apple ('A'). This position is not a wall or part of the snake's body, so it is safe. Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake.  \n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Moving UP would take the head to (row 2, column 4), an empty space (' '). This position is safe but does not contain an apple.  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 4, column 4), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is the optimal choice, as it allows the snake to safely eat an apple, increasing the score and avoiding immediate danger.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   HSS#\n#S SSSS#\n#S SS  #\n#SSSSAA#\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 47. The snake can't reverse direction, so from LEFT, the snake can't go RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. But we need to check which directions are safe to avoid collision with walls or itself, and also see if there's an apple to eat.\n\nFirst, let's find the head position. The head is 'H'. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 3 (0-based index 3) has \"#   HSS#\". So the head is at (3, 3) (assuming rows are 0-7 from top to bottom, columns 0-7 left to right). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #    A # → columns 0 is #, 1-3 spaces, 4 is A, 5 space, 6 #. So (1,4) is A.\nRow 2: #      # → all spaces except walls.\nRow 3: #   HSS# → columns 0 #, 1 space, 2 space, 3 H, 4 S, 5 S, 6 #. So H is at (3,3).\nRow 4: #S SSSS# → columns 0 #, 1 S, 2 space, 3 S, 4 S, 5 S, 6 S, 7 #? Wait, the row is \"#S SSSS#\", which is 8 characters. Let's count: 0 is #, 1 is S, 2 is space, 3 is S, 4 is S, 5 is S, 6 is S, 7 is #. So (4,1), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) are S.\nRow 5: #S SS  # → 0 #, 1 S, 2 space, 3 S, 4 S, 5 space, 6 space, 7 #. So (5,1), (5,3), (5,4) are S.\nRow 6: #SSSSAA# → 0 #, 1 S, 2 S, 3 S, 4 S, 5 A, 6 A, 7 #. So (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) are S; (6,5), (6,6) are A.\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, so the snake is moving left. The next position if it continues LEFT would be (3, 2) (since current head is (3,3), moving left (column decreases by 1) → (3,2)). Let's check if that's safe.\n\nWhat's in (3,2)? Looking at row 3: \"#   HSS#\" → columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: H. So (3,2) is a space. So moving LEFT would take the head to (3,2). Then, the rest of the body would follow. But we need to check if (3,2) is a wall or part of the snake's body.\n\nIs (3,2) a wall? No, the walls are the first and last columns (0 and 7) in each row. So (3,2) is safe (it's a space). So moving LEFT is possible.\n\nNow, what about other directions? The snake can't reverse, so can't go RIGHT. Let's check UP and DOWN.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since can't reverse to RIGHT).\n\nIf direction is UP: the head would move from (3,3) to (2,3) (row decreases by 1). Let's check (2,3). Row 2 is \"#      #\", which is all spaces except the walls. So (2,3) is a space. Is that part of the snake's body? Let's check the body positions. The body is S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 3: (3,4), (3,5) (since row 3 is \"#   HSS#\" → H at (3,3), then S at (3,4), (3,5)).\n\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,3), (5,4).\n\nRow 6: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\nSo (2,3) is not an S. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: head moves from (3,3) to (4,3). Let's check (4,3). Looking at row 4: \"#S SSSS#\" → column 3 is S. So (4,3) is part of the snake's body. So moving DOWN would cause a collision with itself. That's a loss. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT and UP. Now, check if moving in those directions leads to an apple.\n\nApples are at positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,4) is A.\n\nRow 6: (6,5), (6,6) are A.\n\nCurrent head is (3,3). Let's see the next positions:\n\nIf moving LEFT to (3,2): (3,2) is space. No apple there. So the snake would move, body follows. The length would stay the same unless it eats an apple.\n\nIf moving UP to (2,3): (2,3) is space. No apple there either. So neither direction immediately leads to an apple.\n\nBut we need to think about the path. The snake's body is in various positions. Let's consider the current path and possible future moves.\n\nThe snake is moving LEFT. Let's see the current body segments. The snake's body is a chain. Since the head is H, the next segment is S (the immediate body part), then more S's. Let's try to reconstruct the snake's body path.\n\nThe head is at (3,3). The body segments connected to the head: in row 3, to the right of H (since direction is LEFT, the previous direction was probably LEFT, so the body is behind the head. Wait, direction is LEFT, so the head is moving left. The body is where the head was previously. So the first S (immediately after H) is where the head was in the previous step. So if the current direction is LEFT, the head was at (3,4) in the previous step. Then the next S is (3,5), which was the position before that.\n\nThen, in row 4, we have \"#S SSSS#\". Let's see. The S at (4,3) would be the next segment. Because (3,4) (the previous head position) connects to (4,3) if the direction before that was DOWN. Let's see: if the snake was moving down from (4,3) to (3,4), then direction changed to LEFT. That could be possible. Let's try to map the body:\n\nHead (H) at (3,3). Direction is LEFT. So previous head position (epoch 46) was (3,4). So the first body segment (S) is at (3,4). The next segment would be where the head was at epoch 45. Let's say at epoch 45, the head was at (3,5), so the next S is (3,5). Then epoch 44: head at (4,5), so (4,5) is S. Epoch 43: head at (4,6), so (4,6) is S. Epoch 42: head at (4,5)? No, perhaps direction changed. Alternatively, maybe the body goes down. Let's look at row 4: (4,3) is S. So if (3,4) (epoch 46 head) came from (4,3) (epoch 45 head), then direction was UP. Because moving up from (4,3) to (3,4). Then, epoch 45 head is (4,3), which would have come from (4,4) (epoch 44 head) if direction was LEFT. Then (4,4) from (4,5) (epoch 43 head), direction LEFT. (4,5) from (4,6) (epoch 42 head), direction LEFT. (4,6) from (5,6) (epoch 41 head), direction UP. But row 5 has \"#S SS  #\", (5,6) is space, so that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the body is in a more complex shape.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to focus on the next moves. The snake is at (3,3), moving LEFT. The possible directions are LEFT, UP (since DOWN is into body).\n\nIf we choose UP, the head moves to (2,3). Then, the next move (epoch 48) would have direction based on our next input, but we need to choose the direction for epoch 47 (current move). So the question is, which direction (LEFT or UP) is safer and leads to more apples.\n\nLooking at the apples: (1,4) is in row 1, column 4. (6,5) and (6,6) in row 6. The snake's current position is in row 3. To reach (1,4), the snake would need to move up. If the snake moves UP now, (2,3) is safe. Then, next move could be UP again (if possible) towards row 1.\n\nIf the snake continues LEFT to (3,2), then next positions would be (3,1), which is row 3, column 1. Let's check (3,1): row 3 is \"#   HSS#\" → column 1 is space (since columns 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is space, 3 is H). So (3,1) is space. Then (3,0) is a wall (column 0), so moving left from (3,1) to (3,0) would hit a wall. So after moving LEFT once, next move left would be into a wall, which is bad. So moving LEFT now would lead to (3,2), then next possible directions (since current direction would be LEFT) could be UP or DOWN (can't reverse to RIGHT). Let's see, after moving LEFT to (3,2), direction is LEFT, so next possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. If LEFT again, (3,1), then LEFT again (3,0) which is wall. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP now to (2,3). Then the direction becomes UP (since we changed direction to UP). Then next possible directions would be LEFT, RIGHT (can't reverse to DOWN). Let's check if (2,3) is safe, which it is. Then, moving UP again would take the head to (1,3). (1,3) is in row 1, which is \"#    A #\". So (1,3) is space (columns 0 is #, 1-3 are spaces, 4 is A). So (1,3) is safe. Then, from (1,3), moving RIGHT (since direction is UP, next possible directions could be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP). Moving RIGHT would take the head to (1,4), which is the apple at (1,4). That would be good, as eating the apple would increase the score and the snake would grow.\n\nSo if we choose UP now, the path could lead to the apple at (1,4) in the next few moves. Whereas moving LEFT might lead into a wall if not careful. Also, moving DOWN is invalid (body collision). So the best direction is UP.\n\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   HSS#\n#S SSSS#\n#S SS  #\n#SSSSAA#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 3, column 3) (0-indexed).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so RIGHT is invalid.\n- **Collision Checks**:\n  - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (3,3) leads to (4,3), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a self-collision and is invalid.\n  - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (3,3) leads to (3,2), which is empty (safe).\n  - **UP**: Moving UP from (3,3) leads to (2,3), which is empty (safe).\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,4), (6,5), and (6,6).\n\n### Strategic Analysis:\n- **LEFT Direction**: Moving LEFT to (3,2) is safe but does not lead to an apple. Continuing LEFT further would eventually hit a wall (column 0), limiting future movement.\n- **UP Direction**: Moving UP to (2,3) is safe and positions the snake to potentially reach the apple at (1,4) in subsequent moves (e.g., moving UP again to (1,3), then RIGHT to (1,4)). This path avoids immediate walls and self-collisions while targeting an apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the safest and most strategic direction to pursue apples and avoid collisions.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #    A # (so columns 0 is #, then columns 1-4 are spaces, column 5 is A, column 6 is space, column 7 is #)\nRow 2: #   H  # (columns 0 is #, column 3 is H, others are spaces)\nRow 3: #   SSS# (columns 0 is #, columns 3-5 are S, column 6 is #)\nRow 4: #  SSSS# (columns 0 is #, columns 2-5 are S, column 6 is #)\nRow 5: #S SS  # (columns 0 is #, column 1 is S, column 3-4 are S, columns 5-6 are spaces, column 7 is #)\nRow 6: #SSSSAA# (columns 0 is #, columns 1-4 are S, columns 5-6 are A, column 7 is #)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe snake's head is at row 2, column 3 (since H is there). The current direction is UP. The snake moves in the current direction unless a new direction is given, but can't reverse. Since current direction is UP, the snake is moving up (toward row 1, then row 0, etc.). Let's check where the head will move next if we don't change direction. The next position would be row 1, column 3 (since moving up from row 2 to row 1, same column 3). Let's check that position.\n\nRow 1, column 3: in row 1, the string is \"#    A #\". Let's index columns 0-7. Column 0 is #, 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is ' ', 4 is ' ', 5 is 'A', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So row 1, column 3 is a space. So if we continue moving UP, the head moves to (1,3). Now, the rest of the snake's body. The snake's body is made of S's. Let's list all S positions. \n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 3: columns 3,4,5 are S (positions (3,3), (3,4), (3,5))\nRow 4: columns 2,3,4,5 are S (positions (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5))\nRow 5: column 1 is S (5,1), columns 3,4 are S (5,3), (5,4)\nRow 6: columns 1-4 are S (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo the snake's body is these positions. The head is at (2,3). The current direction is UP. So the next head position if moving UP is (1,3). Is (1,3) a wall? No, because row 1's column 3 is a space. Is (1,3) part of the snake's body? Let's check: the body positions are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,1), (5,3), (5,4), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (1,3) is not in that list, so no collision. So moving UP is safe.\n\nBut maybe there's an apple nearby. Let's check where the apples are. The apples are 'A's. Let's find all A positions.\n\nRow 1: column 5 is A (1,5)\nRow 6: columns 5 and 6 are A (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSo current apples are at (1,5), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nIf we move UP, the head goes to (1,3). That's a space, no apple. So no growth, but safe.\n\nNow, possible directions. The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is UP, so the snake can't go DOWN. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP (since UP is the current direction, that's allowed).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. UP: Next head position (1,3). As discussed, safe, no apple.\n\n2. LEFT: Moving left from (2,3) would take the head to (2,2). Check if that's safe. (2,2) is in row 2, which is \"#   H  #\". So row 2's columns: 0 is #, 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is H, 4 is ' ', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So (2,2) is a space. Now, check if (2,2) is part of the snake's body. The body positions are as listed before. (2,2) is not in any of the S positions, so safe. Also, (2,2) is not a wall. So moving LEFT is possible.\n\n3. RIGHT: Moving right from (2,3) is (2,4). Check (2,4): row 2, column 4 is ' ', since row 2 is \"#   H  #\". So (2,4) is a space. Check if part of body: body positions don't include (2,4), so safe.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which direction would get the snake closer to an apple. Let's look at the apples. The closest apple is (1,5) (row 1, column 5). The head is at (2,3). The distance to (1,5) is (2-1) rows up, (5-3) columns right. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,4), which is one step closer to column 5. Then, if next direction is RIGHT again, it could reach (2,5), then (1,5) if moving up. Alternatively, moving UP to (1,3), then RIGHT towards (1,5). Let's see:\n\nIf current direction is UP, moving UP to (1,3). Then the next possible directions would be UP (can't reverse, so can't go down), LEFT, RIGHT. From (1,3), moving RIGHT would take to (1,4), then (1,5) (which is the apple). That would get the apple. So if we move UP now, then next move RIGHT, we can reach the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we move RIGHT now, head goes to (2,4). Then, possible directions: RIGHT (current direction would be RIGHT, so can't go left), UP, DOWN (but DOWN is reverse of current direction? Wait, no. Current direction is UP, but if we change direction to RIGHT, then the next move's current direction is RIGHT. So when you change direction, the current direction becomes the new direction. Oh, right. Because the direction input changes the snake's movement direction. So the snake's movement direction is the direction given, as long as it's not a reverse of the previous direction.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\"\n\nSo, the snake's current direction is UP. The player can input a direction, but it can't be the reverse. So the allowed directions are UP (same), LEFT (not reverse), RIGHT (not reverse). Because reverse of UP is DOWN, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, if the player inputs RIGHT, then the snake's new direction is RIGHT, and moves in that direction. So, the next movement direction is RIGHT.\n\nSo, let's re-express:\n\nCurrent direction: UP.\n\nPossible directions to input: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse).\n\nIf we input UP: snake moves UP (row 1, column 3). Then, next direction can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since current direction becomes UP again).\n\nIf we input RIGHT: snake moves RIGHT (row 2, column 4). Then, next direction can be RIGHT, UP, DOWN (since reverse of RIGHT is LEFT, so can't go LEFT).\n\nBut the question is, what's the best direction now to get an apple. Let's check if any of the possible next positions have an apple.\n\nCurrent head position (2,3).\n\nPossible next positions:\n\nUP: (1,3) → no apple.\n\nLEFT: (2,2) → no apple.\n\nRIGHT: (2,4) → no apple.\n\nSo none of the immediate next moves have an apple. So need to plan ahead.\n\nThe apples are at (1,5), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nLet's see the snake's body. The snake is quite long. Let's check possible paths.\n\nThe snake's body is in rows 3,4,5,6. Let's list all S positions again:\n\nRow 3: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nRow 4: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nRow 6: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo the snake's body is forming a sort of trail. The head is at (2,3), which is above row 3's (3,3) S. So the snake is moving up, and the body is behind it.\n\nIf the snake continues moving up, it will go into row 1, then row 0 (which is a wall). So row 0 is a wall (all #). So moving up from row 1 (row 1 is the second row, index 1) to row 0 (index 0) would be a collision with the wall, which is bad. So the snake can't go up too much. Let's check row 0's columns. Row 0 is ########, so all columns 0-7 are #. So if the head is in row 1, column 3, moving up again (to row 0, column 3) would hit the wall. So that's a problem. So moving UP now (to row 1, column 3) would mean the next move (epoch 49) could be UP again, leading to row 0, column 3 (wall), game over. So that's dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, if we move UP to (1,3), then the next move should not be UP. So maybe move RIGHT. Let's see:\n\nEpoch 48: move UP → head (1,3). Epoch 49: direction RIGHT → head (1,4). Epoch 50: direction RIGHT → head (1,5), which is the apple. That would be good. But need to check if (1,4) and (1,5) are safe.\n\n(1,4) is in row 1, which is \"#    A #\". Column 4 is ' ' (since row 1's columns: 0=#,1= ,2= ,3= ,4= ,5=A,6= ,7=#). So (1,4) is safe (no body, no wall). (1,5) is the apple, which is safe (eating it, no collision). So that path is possible.\n\nBut what if the snake's body is in the way? Let's check (1,4) and (1,5) against the body positions. The body is in rows 3-6, so (1,4) and (1,5) are not part of the body. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, if we move RIGHT now (epoch 48 direction RIGHT), head goes to (2,4). Then, next direction could be RIGHT again (epoch 49 direction RIGHT), head (2,5). Then epoch 50 direction UP, head (1,5) (the apple). Let's check (2,5): row 2 is \"#   H  #\", column 5 is ' ', so (2,5) is safe. Then (1,5) is the apple. That's also a possible path.\n\nSo which path is better? Let's see if there are any obstacles. The snake's body is in lower rows, so moving up or right seems safe.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's current body. Let's think about the snake's movement. Each time the snake moves, the body follows. So when the head moves, the tail (last S) may disappear unless the snake eats an apple (which makes it grow, so the tail stays). Since the snake hasn't eaten an apple in the current move (the next position doesn't have an apple), the tail will move forward. So the body will shift.\n\nBut perhaps the main concern is avoiding collision with the body or walls. Let's check possible collisions in the next steps.\n\nIf we move UP now (epoch 48):\n\nHead (1,3). The body will shift: the previous head (2,3) becomes S, and the tail (the last S) is removed. Let's find the tail. The snake's body is a sequence. Since the snake is moving UP, the head was previously moving up, so the body is in the path behind. Let's reconstruct the snake's body as a list. The head is at (2,3). The body segments follow. Let's assume the snake's body is ordered from head to tail.\n\nAssuming the snake is moving UP, the previous positions would be:\n\nCurrent head (2,3). The previous position (before moving to (2,3)) would be (3,3), because the direction was UP. So the body after moving to (2,3) would have (3,3) as the next segment, then (4,3), etc. Let's check:\n\nRow 3 has SSS in columns 3-5. So (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).\n\nRow 4 has SSSS in columns 2-5: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nRow 5 has S in (5,1), (5,3), (5,4).\n\nRow 6 has SSSS in (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\nSo the snake's body is a bit fragmented. Maybe the snake's body is a chain. Let's think of the snake's body as a list, where each segment follows the previous. For example, the head is (2,3). The next segment (neck) would be (3,3) (since the snake was moving up into (2,3) from (3,3)), then (4,3), then (4,2), then (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,4), (3,5). Hmm, this might be a bit complicated, but perhaps the key is that the body is in lower rows, so the upper rows (rows 0-2) are mostly empty except for the head and the apple.\n\nSo moving up to (1,3) is safe, as that's not part of the body. Then moving right towards (1,5) (the apple) is possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (2,4) is also safe, then right to (2,5), then up to (1,5) (apple). Either path could work.\n\nBut we need to choose the direction that avoids walls and body. Let's check the other apple positions. The apples at (6,5) and (6,6) are in row 6, which is where the snake's body is. The snake's body is in row 6, columns 1-4, so (6,5) and (6,6) are free. But the head is at row 2, so those apples are far away. The closest apple is (1,5).\n\nSo the best approach is to move towards (1,5). The head is at (2,3). To reach (1,5), the head needs to go up (row 1) and right (columns 4,5). So moving UP first (to (1,3)) then RIGHT, or moving RIGHT first (to (2,4)) then UP and RIGHT.\n\nBut let's check if moving UP now would lead to a wall in the next step. If the snake moves UP to (1,3) in epoch 48, then in epoch 49, if it moves UP again, it would go to (0,3), which is a wall (game over). So the snake must not move UP again in epoch 49. So the player should input RIGHT in epoch 49. But since the current question is about epoch 48, we need to choose the direction for epoch 48.\n\nIf we input UP in epoch 48, then the head is at (1,3). Then, in epoch 49, the player can input RIGHT, moving to (1,4), then in epoch 50 input RIGHT to reach (1,5) (apple). That's three steps.\n\nIf we input RIGHT in epoch 48, head moves to (2,4). Then epoch 49 input RIGHT to (2,5), epoch 50 input UP to (1,5) (apple). That's also three steps. Either way.\n\nIs there a reason to prefer one direction over the other? Let's check if there are any body parts in the path. For the UP then RIGHT path: (1,3) → (1,4) → (1,5). (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) are all empty (no S). For the RIGHT then UP path: (2,4) → (2,5) → (1,5). (2,4) and (2,5) are empty (row 2 is \"#   H  #\", so column 4 and 5 are spaces). So both paths are safe.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's current direction is UP. If we continue moving UP, the next position is (1,3). The body's tail would move. Since the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (last segment) would be removed. Let's see where the tail is. The snake's body is long. The tail is probably the last S in the chain. For example, if the snake's body is ordered head (2,3) → (3,3) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (5,1) → (6,1) → (6,2) → (6,3) → (6,4) → (5,4) → (5,3) → (4,4) → (4,5) → (3,4) → (3,5), then the tail would be (3,5). When the snake moves, the tail (3,5) would be removed. So the new body after moving UP would be (2,3) becomes S, (3,3) becomes S, (4,3) becomes S, (4,2) becomes S, (5,1) becomes S, (6,1) becomes S, (6,2) becomes S, (6,3) becomes S, (6,4) becomes S, (5,4) becomes S, (5,3) becomes S, (4,4) becomes S, (4,5) becomes S, (3,4) becomes S. The (3,5) is removed. So the body in row 3 would now have (3,3), (3,4) as S, and (3,5) becomes empty. So moving UP doesn't create any new obstacles.\n\nIn conclusion, both UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are possible, but the best direction is to move towards the nearest apple (1,5). Between UP and RIGHT, moving RIGHT might be better to avoid the wall in the next step. Because if we move UP now, the next step could be a wall if we're not careful. Alternatively, moving RIGHT keeps the head in row 2, which is safer from the top wall. Let's see:\n\nIf we move RIGHT now (epoch 48, direction RIGHT), head is at (2,4). Then, in epoch 49, we can move RIGHT again to (2,5). Then epoch 50, move UP to (1,5), which is the apple. That path avoids the top wall (row 0) and is safe. So moving RIGHT now is a good choice.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#   H  #\n#   SSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#S SS  #\n#SSSSAA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 2, column 3), and the current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The goal is to move toward apples while avoiding walls and self-collision.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,5), (6,5), and (6,6). The closest apple is (1,5) (row 1, column 5).\n2. **Safe Moves**: Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN is reversed). \n   - **UP**: Moves head to (1,3). This is safe (no walls\/body), but the next move upward would hit the top wall (row 0), which is dangerous.\n   - **LEFT**: Moves head to (2,2). Safe but moves away from the nearest apple.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moves head to (2,4). Safe and positions the head closer to the nearest apple (1,5).\n\n### Strategy:\nMoving RIGHT brings the head closer to the nearest apple (1,5). From (2,4), subsequent RIGHT moves can reach (2,5), then UP to (1,5) (the apple). This path avoids walls and self-collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#   SH #\n#   SSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#  SS  #\n#SSSSAA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT, and the current epoch is 49. The snake is moving right. Let's first map out the positions of the snake's head and body. \n\nFirst, let's list each row (rows are numbered from top to bottom, 0 to 7). Columns are 0 to 7 (left to right).\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #    A # → columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: '#'\nRow 2: #   SH # → columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: '#'\nRow 3: #   SSS# → columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: '#'\nRow 4: #  SSSS# → columns 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: '#'\nRow 5: #  SS  # → columns 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: '#'\nRow 6: #SSSSAA# → columns 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'A', 6: 'A', 7: '#'\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is in row 2, column 4. Since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move would be to row 2, column 5 (since moving right increases the column index by 1). Let's check where that is. \n\nRow 2, column 5 is a ' ' (empty). So if we continue moving RIGHT, the head moves to (2,5). Then, the body follows. But wait, we need to check if moving RIGHT would cause a collision. The new head position (2,5) is empty, so no collision with self or wall. So that's safe.\n\nBut maybe there's a better direction. Let's check possible directions. The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is RIGHT, so reversing would be LEFT, which is not allowed. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse). Wait, no: the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. Reversing direction is when the new direction is opposite to current. So current direction is RIGHT, so the opposite is LEFT. So the snake can turn UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT. LEFT is not allowed.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n1. Continue RIGHT: next head position (2,5). Check if that's a wall? No, row 2, column 5 is within the board (columns 0-7, 5 is valid). The cell is empty. So after moving, the head is there. The body parts will shift. The previous head (2,4) becomes 'S' (since the snake moves forward, the tail may or may not move depending on whether an apple was eaten. But in this case, there's no apple at (2,5), so the snake's length doesn't increase. So the tail (the end of the snake) will move forward, so the body will shift. So the new head is (2,5), previous head (2,4) becomes S, and the tail (the last S) will be removed. But we need to check the current snake's body to know the tail. Let's track the snake's body.\n\nCurrent snake: The head is (2,4). Let's trace the body. Let's look for the connected S's. \n\nRow 2: (2,3) is S. So from head (2,4), previous part is (2,3). \n\nRow 3: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) are S. So (2,3) connects to (3,3). \n\nRow 4: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are S. So (3,3) connects to (4,3) (since 4,3 is S). \n\nRow 5: (5,2), (5,3) are S. (4,2) is S, so (4,2) connects to (5,2). \n\nRow 6: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) are S. (5,2) connects to (6,2). \n\nSo the snake's body is a chain: \n\nHead (2,4) → (2,3) → (3,3) → (3,4) → (3,5) → (4,3) → (4,4) → (4,5) → (4,2) → (5,2) → (5,3) → (6,2) → (6,1) → (6,3) → (6,4)? Wait, maybe I need to map it properly. Let's list all S positions and H:\n\nH is at (2,4).\n\nS positions: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\nSo the snake's body is a connected path. The direction of movement is RIGHT, so the head moves right. The body follows. The tail is the end of the snake. Let's see: when the snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the tail (the last segment) would be removed unless an apple is eaten (which adds a segment).\n\nSo, in the current state, if we move RIGHT (to (2,5)), since there's no apple there, the snake's length remains the same. So the tail (the last S) would be removed. The new head is (2,5), and the rest of the body shifts. But since (2,5) is empty, this is safe.\n\nNow, check the other directions:\n\nOption 2: UP. Current direction is RIGHT, so turning UP is allowed (not reverse). Moving UP would mean the head moves from (2,4) to (1,4). Let's check (1,4). Looking at row 1: #    A #. Column 4 is 'A' (since row 1 is index 1, columns 0 is '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: '#'). So (1,4) is an apple! So if the snake moves UP, it will eat the apple. That's good because the score increases by 1, and the snake grows by 1 (so the tail doesn't get removed; the length increases, so the body will have an extra segment). \n\nBut wait, moving UP from (2,4) (row 2, column 4) to (1,4) (row 1, column 4). Is (1,4) a valid position? Yes, since row 1 is within 0-7, column 4 is 0-7, and it's not a wall. The cell has an 'A', so eating it. That's a good move because it's an apple. So moving UP would result in eating the apple, which is beneficial.\n\nOption 3: DOWN. Current direction is RIGHT, turning DOWN is allowed. The head is at (2,4), moving DOWN would go to (3,4). Let's check (3,4): in row 3, column 4 is 'S' (row 3 is #   SSS#, columns 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S'). So (3,4) is part of the snake's body. So moving DOWN would cause the head to collide with the body (since (3,4) is S). That's a collision, so the game ends. So moving DOWN is invalid, as it leads to a loss.\n\nSo the possible directions are RIGHT (safe, no apple), UP (safe, apple), or DOWN (collision, game over). So the best choice is UP, as it allows eating an apple, increasing the score, and the snake grows. \n\nSo the answer should be UP.\n\n\n########\n#    A #\n#   SH #\n#   SSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#  SS  #\n#SSSSAA#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 2, column 4). The current direction is RIGHT.\n2. **Possible Moves**: The snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT is invalid). Valid options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n3. **Analysis of Each Move**:\n   - **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (row 2, column 5), which is empty. This is safe but does not eat an apple.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (row 3, column 4), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a collision, ending the game.\n   - **UP**: Moving up would take the head to (row 1, column 4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score, grows the snake, and avoids collision.\n\nThe best move is UP, as it safely eats an apple and avoids immediate danger.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board.\n\nThe board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #    H # → So the head 'H' is at position (1,4) [assuming rows are 0-indexed from top, columns 0 from left. So row 1, column 4.]\nRow 2: #A  SS # → 'A' at (2,1), then 'SS' at (2,4) and (2,5)\nRow 3: #   SSS# → 'SSS' at (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\nRow 4: #  SSSS# → 'SSSS' at (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\nRow 5: #  SS  # → 'SS' at (5,2), (5,3)\nRow 6: #SSSSAA# → 'SSSS' at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), then 'AA' at (6,5), (6,6)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. Since the snake can't reverse direction, the next direction can't be DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFirst, let's track the snake's body to avoid collision. The head is at (1,4). The snake's body is the 'S's. Let's list all the positions of the snake's body and head:\n\nHead (H): (1,4)\nBody (S): Let's check each row:\n\nRow 2: (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\nRow 4: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\nRow 5: (5,2), (5,3)\nRow 6: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo the body segments are all these positions. Now, the snake is moving UP. The current direction is UP, so the next head position if we keep moving UP would be (0,4), which is a wall (row 0 is all #). So moving UP would cause a collision with the wall, which is a game over. So UP is invalid.\n\nSo the snake can't go UP. Now possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT (since DOWN is reversing direction, which is not allowed). Let's check LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nCurrent head position is (1,4). \n\nIf direction is LEFT: the new head position would be (1,3). Let's check if (1,3) is a wall or a body part. (1,3) is in row 1, column 3. The row 1 is \"#    H #\", so columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4:H, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So (1,3) is a space. Now check if it's a body part. The body parts are all the S positions listed earlier. (1,3) is not in any of those positions. So moving LEFT would be safe.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: new head position is (1,5). Let's check (1,5). Row 1, column 5. The row 1 is \"#    H #\", so column 5 is a space (since H is at 4, then 5 is space). Now check if (1,5) is a body part. The body parts: (2,5) is S (row 2, column 5). (1,5) is not in the body list. So (1,5) is a space. So moving RIGHT would also be safe.\n\nNow, check if there are apples in the possible new positions. Let's look for 'A's on the board. The apples are at:\n\nRow 2, column 1: (2,1) → A\nRow 6, column 5: (6,5) → A\nRow 6, column 6: (6,6) → A\n\nSo the current head is at (1,4). The next positions if moving LEFT (1,3) or RIGHT (1,5) don't have apples. So moving LEFT or RIGHT won't eat an apple now.\n\nBut we need to plan ahead. Let's see the snake's body structure. The snake is quite long. Let's think about the path. The snake is moving up, but can't go up (wall). So possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check the next possible moves after this step. Suppose we choose LEFT. The new head is (1,3). Then the next direction can't be RIGHT (since current direction would be LEFT, so can't reverse to RIGHT). The next possible directions would be LEFT, UP, DOWN. But need to avoid walls and body.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose RIGHT, new head is (1,5). Next direction can't be LEFT (since direction is RIGHT). Next possible directions: RIGHT, UP, DOWN.\n\nBut we need to avoid collision. Let's check the body's positions to see if moving LEFT or RIGHT would lead to a safe path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Let's see the current body structure. The snake's body is forming a sort of trail. The head is at (1,4), and the body goes down through (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,3), (6,3), etc. So the snake is in a kind of vertical column from row 1 (head) down to row 6.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (1,3), the next position. Let's see what's around (1,3). The left is (1,2), which is space. Up is (0,3) which is a wall. Down is (2,3). Let's check (2,3): row 2 is \"#A  SS #\", columns 0: #, 1:A, 2: space, 3: space, 4:S, 5:S, 6: space, 7: #. So (2,3) is space. So moving LEFT now, then maybe down next (since direction can be changed to DOWN if possible). But need to check.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (1,5). Then next possible direction could be DOWN. Let's check (1,5) down is (2,5), which is a body part (row 2, column 5 is S). Oh, right! The current row 2 has 'SS' at (2,4) and (2,5). So (2,5) is S. So if the head moves RIGHT to (1,5), then moving DOWN next would take the head to (2,5), which is a body collision. That's bad.\n\nSo if we choose RIGHT now, the next move down would hit the body. What about moving RIGHT and then RIGHT again? The next position would be (1,6). Let's check (1,6): row 1 is \"#    H #\", column 6 is space (since 7 is #). So (1,6) is space. Then, moving RIGHT again (if direction is RIGHT) would take head to (1,7), which is a wall. So that's a problem. So moving RIGHT may lead to a dead end.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (1,3), then next possible direction could be DOWN. Let's see. The head is at (1,3). Direction is LEFT. So next direction can't be RIGHT. Possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN. UP would be (0,3), wall. LEFT would be (1,2), which is space. Let's check (1,2): row 1, column 2. It's a space. Then, moving LEFT again would take to (1,1). (1,1) is space. Then, maybe down. Let's see (2,1) which is an apple (A). Oh! (2,1) is an apple. So if the snake moves LEFT twice (from (1,4) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1)), then down to (2,1), which is the apple. That would be a good path. Because (2,1) is A, so eating that apple would increase the score and the snake would grow.\n\nSo moving LEFT now allows the snake to reach the apple at (2,1) in a few steps, whereas moving RIGHT might not lead to apples and could hit the body or wall.\n\nSo the best direction here is LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#    H #\n#A  SS #\n#   SSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#  SS  #\n#SSSSAA#\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so cannot choose DOWN). The head is at (1,4) (row 1, column 4). \n\n- Moving UP would take the head to (0,4), which is a wall (game over).  \n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (1,3), which is empty (no wall or body collision).  \n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (1,5), which is empty (no wall or body collision).  \n\nNext, evaluating future paths:  \n- If moving RIGHT to (1,5), the next possible directions (RIGHT, UP, DOWN) risk hitting walls (e.g., moving RIGHT again to (1,6) then (1,7) is a wall) or body (e.g., moving DOWN to (2,5), which is a body segment).  \n- If moving LEFT to (1,3), the path can proceed left to (1,2) and (1,1), then down to (2,1) (which has an apple). This path avoids collisions and leads to an apple.  \n\nThus, the safest and most strategic direction is LEFT.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#   HS #\n#A  SS #\n#   SSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#  SS  #\n# SSSAA#\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 51, which is well before the 100th, so the game isn't ending yet. \n\nFirst, let's locate the snake's head. The head is 'H'. Looking at the first row (after the top wall), row 1 (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top, but let's check each line):\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #   HS # → Let's index each character. The first '#' is position 0, then positions 1-6 are the inner. So positions 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: '#'\nSo H is at (1,3) (row 1, column 3). Because row 1 is the second line.\n\nThe snake's body is 'S' around. Let's track the snake's body segments. The current direction is LEFT, which means the snake is moving to the left (column decreases). The head's next position if moving LEFT would be (1,2) (since current head is (1,3), moving left is column 3-1=2). \n\nBut we need to check if that next position is valid. Let's see what's at (1,2). Row 1 is \"#   HS #\", so column 2 is ' ' (space). So moving LEFT would take the head to (1,2), which is empty. But wait, what's the snake's body positions? Let's list all S and H positions:\n\nRow 1: H at (1,3), S at (1,4)\nRow 2: #A  SS # → Let's parse row 2. Columns 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S' → S at (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3: #   SSS# → columns 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S' → (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\nRow 4: #  SSSS# → columns 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S' → (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\nRow 5: #  SS  # → columns 2: 'S', 3: 'S' → (5,2), (5,3)\nRow 6: # SSSAA# → columns 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S' → (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). Also apples at (6,4), (6,5).\n\nSo the snake's body is all these S positions, and the head is H at (1,3). The snake's direction is LEFT, so the next head position if moving LEFT is (1,2). Let's check if (1,2) is a wall or body. The walls are the '#' around the edges, so row 0 and row 7 (since the board is 8x8, rows 0-7). Columns 0 and 7 are walls. (1,2) is row 1, column 2. Column 2 is within 1-6 (since the inner part is columns 1-6), so not a wall. Now, is (1,2) part of the snake's body? Looking at all S positions: (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). (1,2) is not in any of these, so moving LEFT is possible (no collision with self or wall).\n\nBut maybe there's an apple in that direction? Let's check (1,2). The current cell is a space, so no apple. So moving LEFT would just move the head to (1,2), and the body would follow. But since the snake's length is the number of H + S. Let's count: H (1) + S positions: let's count the S's. \n\nRow 1: 1 S (1,4)\nRow 2: 2 S (4,5)\nRow 3: 3 S (3,4,5)\nRow 4: 4 S (2,3,4,5)\nRow 5: 2 S (2,3)\nRow 6: 3 S (1,2,3)\nTotal S: 1+2+3+4+2+3=15. So snake length is 1 (H) +15 (S) =16. So when moving, the tail (last S) would move only if the head doesn't eat an apple. Because when the snake eats an apple, it grows, so the tail doesn't move. Otherwise, the tail is removed.\n\nNow, the possible directions. The current direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction. Reversing would be RIGHT (since current is LEFT, opposite is RIGHT). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (since can't reverse to RIGHT). So the player can choose LEFT (continue), UP, or DOWN.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT: next head position (1,2). What's there? It's a space (no apple). So the snake moves, the tail (last S) is removed. The new head is (1,2), and the body shifts. No apple eaten, score remains same. No collision.\n\n2. UP: current direction is LEFT. Turning UP is allowed (not reverse). The head's current position is (1,3). Moving UP would take it to row 0, column 3. Row 0 is the top wall (all '#'), so (0,3) is a wall. Collision with wall, game ends. So UP is invalid.\n\n3. DOWN: current direction is LEFT. Turning DOWN is allowed. The head's position (1,3) moving DOWN would go to row 2, column 3. Let's check row 2: \"#A  SS #\". Column 3 is ' ' (since row 2 is columns 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: '#'). So (2,3) is a space. Is that part of the snake's body? Looking at the S positions, (2,3) is not in the list (row 2 S are at 4 and 5). So (2,3) is safe. Now, is there an apple there? No, row 2, column 3 is ' ', so no. So moving DOWN would take the head to (2,3). No collision, no apple.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's any apples nearby. Let's list all apples (A) on the board.\n\nRow 1: #   HS # → no A.\nRow 2: #A  SS # → A at (2,1).\nRow 6: # SSSAA# → A at (6,4), (6,5). Any others? Let's check all rows:\n\nRow 0: ######## → no.\nRow 1: #   HS # → no.\nRow 2: #A  SS # → A at (2,1).\nRow 3: #   SSS# → no.\nRow 4: #  SSSS# → no.\nRow 5: #  SS  # → no.\nRow 6: # SSSAA# → A at (6,4), (6,5).\n\nSo apples are at (2,1), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nSo the snake's head is at (1,3). Let's see the possible moves:\n\n- LEFT: (1,2). Not an apple. \n- DOWN: (2,3). Not an apple. \n- UP: (0,3) → wall (invalid).\n\nIs there a way to reach an apple? Let's see. The closest apple is (2,1). Let's see the path from H's current position (1,3) to (2,1). \n\nIf the snake is moving LEFT, current direction is LEFT. Let's think about possible moves. If the snake continues LEFT to (1,2), then next possible directions. After moving LEFT, the new direction would be LEFT (since the direction is the direction of movement). Then next move could be LEFT again (to (1,1)), which is (1,1) → row 1, column 1. What's there? Row 1 is \"#   HS #\", column 1 is ' ', so (1,1) is space. Then moving LEFT again would be (1,0), which is a wall (column 0 is wall), so can't. Alternatively, after moving LEFT to (1,2), direction is LEFT, next possible directions could be UP (invalid, wall), DOWN (row 2, column 2). Let's check (row 2, column 2) which is in row 2: \"#A  SS #\", column 2 is ' ', so (2,2) is space. Then from (1,2), moving DOWN to (2,2). Then from there, moving LEFT (since direction could be LEFT again) to (2,1), which is the apple at (2,1). That's an apple. So if the snake moves LEFT now, then next move could be DOWN, then LEFT again to reach the apple. But we need to check if that path is possible without collision.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake turns DOWN now (current direction LEFT, turn DOWN). So head moves from (1,3) to (2,3). Then the next direction could be LEFT (since can't reverse from DOWN to UP, but can turn LEFT). So from (2,3), moving LEFT to (2,2), then LEFT to (2,1) (the apple). That would reach the apple in two steps. Let's check if those positions are safe.\n\nCurrent head at (1,3). If direction is DOWN, next head (2,3). Check (2,3): is it part of the body? The body S positions are (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). (2,3) is not in any of these. So safe. Then next direction could be LEFT (since after moving DOWN, the direction is DOWN, so next possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (can't reverse to UP). If the snake then moves LEFT from (2,3) to (2,2). (2,2) is ' ' (row 2, column 2 is ' '), and not part of the body. Then moving LEFT again (direction LEFT) to (2,1), which is the apple. That would be good. So if the snake moves DOWN now, then LEFT, then LEFT again, it can reach the apple.\n\nBut let's check the current possible directions. The player has to choose a direction now. The options are LEFT, UP, DOWN. UP is invalid (wall). So options are LEFT or DOWN.\n\nIf the player chooses LEFT, the head moves to (1,2). Then next direction can be LEFT (to (1,1)), then next direction could be DOWN (to (2,1)), which is the apple. (1,1) is (row 1, column 1), which is ' ', then moving DOWN to (2,1) which is the apple. So (2,1) is the apple. So (1,2) → (1,1) → (2,1). Let's check (2,1): yes, that's the apple in row 2, column 1.\n\nBut (1,1) is (row 1, column 1), which is ' ', and (2,1) is 'A'. So if the snake moves LEFT (to 1,2), then LEFT again (to 1,1), then DOWN (to 2,1). That's possible.\n\nBut in the current step, which direction is better? Let's check if moving LEFT now is safe, and moving DOWN is safe. Both are safe. The question is which direction leads towards an apple. The apple at (2,1) is to the left and down from the current head. So perhaps moving LEFT first would get closer.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first would take the head to (2,3), which is one step down. Then moving LEFT to (2,2), then LEFT to (2,1) (apple). That's two steps. Whereas moving LEFT first, then LEFT, then DOWN: (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (2,1). That's three steps. So moving DOWN first might be a better path to reach the apple sooner.\n\nBut let's make sure there are no body collisions in those paths. For example, if the snake moves DOWN to (2,3), then LEFT to (2,2), then LEFT to (2,1). Are those positions part of the body? Let's check:\n\n(2,3) is not a body part (as before). (2,2) is not a body part (body in row 2 is at 4 and 5). (2,1) is the apple, so not a body part. So that path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,2). (1,2) is safe. Then moving LEFT to (1,1). (1,1) is ' ', safe. Then moving DOWN to (2,1) (apple). (2,1) is 'A', so that's safe. \n\nSo both paths are possible. But the question is which direction to choose now. Since the current direction is LEFT, and the player can choose to continue LEFT or turn DOWN (UP is invalid). \n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's body is arranged in a way that might block other paths. Let's look at the body positions. The snake's body is in a sort of chain. The head is at (1,3), and the body goes to (1,4) (row 1, column 4). Then (2,4), (2,5) (row 2, columns 4 and 5). Then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) (row 3, columns 3-5). Then (4,2-5) (row 4, columns 2-5), (5,2-3) (row 5, columns 2-3), (6,1-3) (row 6, columns 1-3). So the snake is coiled in the lower part of the board. The head is in row 1, column 3. The body extends down and to the right.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT, the head goes to (1,2), which is a space. Then, the next move could be LEFT again to (1,1), then DOWN to (2,1) (the apple). That's a valid path.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN, the head goes to (2,3), then LEFT to (2,2), then LEFT to (2,1) (apple). Also valid.\n\nWhich direction is better? Let's think about possible collisions. For example, if the snake moves DOWN, (2,3) is safe. Then moving LEFT to (2,2) (safe). Then moving LEFT to (2,1) (apple). That's three steps (current epoch 51, then 52, 53, 54). Epoch 54 would eat the apple. \n\nIf moving LEFT, then LEFT, then DOWN: epoch 51 (current), 52 (LEFT to 1,2), 53 (LEFT to 1,1), 54 (DOWN to 2,1). Also three steps. So same number of steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another apple. The other apples are at (6,4) and (6,5). Those are in row 6, columns 4 and 5. The snake's body is in row 6, columns 1-3, so (6,4) and (6,5) are to the right of the body. But the head is in row 1, so that's far away. So the closest apple is (2,1).\n\nSo the best approach is to move towards (2,1). Between the two options (LEFT or DOWN), which is better? Let's see.\n\nIf we choose DOWN now, the next head position is (2,3). From there, moving LEFT would take us towards (2,1). That's a more direct path. Because (2,3) is in row 2, which is the same row as the apple (2,1). So moving left from row 2 would approach the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now takes us to row 1, column 2, which is in row 1, and then moving down to row 2. Either way, but perhaps moving DOWN now is better because it gets the head into the same row as the apple (row 2), allowing a direct left movement towards the apple. \n\nAnother consideration: the snake's current direction is LEFT. If the player chooses to continue moving LEFT, that's allowed. But if the player turns DOWN, that's also allowed (since it's not the reverse direction). \n\nIs there any danger in moving DOWN? Let's check the next position (2,3). The body in row 2 is at columns 4 and 5, so (2,3) is safe. So no collision. \n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN, which is better. Since both are safe, but moving DOWN gets the head into row 2, which is where the apple is, perhaps that's better. Let's go with DOWN.\n\n\n########\n#   HS #\n#A  SS #\n#   SSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#  SS  #\n# SSSAA#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- **Snake Head Position**: (Row 1, Column 3) (marked 'H').\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT (snake is moving left).\n- **Apples**: Located at (Row 2, Column 1), (Row 6, Column 4), and (Row 6, Column 5).\n- **Collision Rules**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., LEFT → RIGHT), and loses if it hits walls or itself.\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (1,3) would take the head to (0,3), which is a wall (row 0 is the top boundary). This causes an immediate collision. **Invalid**.\n   \n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1,3) takes the head to (1,2) (empty space, no collision). This is safe but does not reach an apple immediately. The snake would need additional moves to approach the nearest apple at (2,1).\n\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,3) takes the head to (2,3) (empty space, no collision). This positions the head in Row 2, the same row as the nearest apple (2,1). From (2,3), subsequent LEFT moves can directly approach the apple at (2,1) in fewer steps compared to moving LEFT first.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is safe, avoids collision, and positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (2,1) more directly.\n\nAnswer: DOWN"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls.

I need to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, let's start by understanding the current game state.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls around the edges. The current direction is UP, and the epoch is 1, so we're early in the game. Let's parse the board.\n\nThe board given is:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nLet's map out the positions. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, maybe? Let's index rows 0 to 7 (since it's 8 rows). Each row has 8 characters.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  A   # → positions 1 (column 1: ' '), 2 (column 2: ' '), 3 (column 3: 'A'), 4 (column 4: ' '), 5 (column 5: ' '), 6 (column 6: ' '), 7 (column 7: '#')\nRow 2: #      # → all spaces except walls at 0 and 7.\nRow 3: #      # → same as row 2.\nRow 4: #  HA  # → columns 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: 'A', 5: ' ' (since 0 and 7 are '#')\nRow 5: #   A  # → columns 3: 'A' (since 0 is '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#')\nRow 6: #      # → all spaces except walls.\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at row 4, column 3. The current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving upward. Let's confirm the possible directions the snake can turn. Since the current direction is UP, the snake can't reverse direction (can't go DOWN). So possible directions are UP (current), LEFT, RIGHT. Because reversing (UP to DOWN) is not allowed.\n\nThe snake moves one square in the chosen direction. Let's check each possible direction's outcome.\n\nFirst, current direction is UP. If we choose UP, the next position of the head would be row 3, column 3 (since moving up from row 4 to row 3, same column). Let's check what's there. Row 3, column 3: looking at row 3, which is \"#      #\", so column 3 is a space (' '). So the snake's head moves there. Since it's a space, no apple eaten. The snake's length is 1, so no body. So the new head is at (3,3), and the previous head (4,3) becomes 'S' (body) because the snake moves. So the new board would have 'H' at (3,3), 'S' at (4,3). No collision, so game continues.\n\nNext, direction LEFT. Current head is (4,3). Moving LEFT would take it to (4,2). Let's check row 4: \"#  HA  #\". Columns are 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So column 2 in row 4 is ' ', so moving left to (4,2) is a space. So the head moves there, previous head (4,3) becomes 'S'. No collision. So that's possible.\n\nDirection RIGHT: current head (4,3). Moving RIGHT to (4,4). Row 4, column 4 is 'A' (from \"#  HA  #\": H is column 3, A is column 4). Oh, that's an apple! So if the snake moves RIGHT, the head goes to (4,4), which is an apple. So the snake eats the apple, score increases by 1, and the snake grows. Since the snake's length was 1 (only head), after eating, the length becomes 2. So the new head is at (4,4), and the previous head (4,3) becomes 'S' (body). The apple at (4,4) is consumed, so that position is now 'H'. Then, a new apple would be placed (but the example shows that after eating, the apple is replaced, but the problem statement says the game starts with 3 apples. Let's check the initial count. The current board has 3 apples: row 1 column 3, row 4 column 4, row 5 column 3. So if the snake eats the apple at (4,4), then that apple is gone, and maybe a new one is generated, but the example shows that after eating, the apple is removed. For example, the example's initial board had A's, and after moving down (eating one), the new board has the H in the apple's place and the other A's remain. So in our case, moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,4), which is an apple, so the snake eats it. The score increases by 1. The snake's length increases by 1, so the body is added. Since the snake was length 1, after moving, the head is at (4,4), and the previous position (4,3) becomes 'S'. The apple at (4,4) is removed. So that's a good move because it gets an apple immediately.\n\nWhat about direction DOWN? But current direction is UP, so reversing direction is not allowed. The rules say the snake cannot reverse direction (i.e., cannot turn UP to DOWN or LEFT to RIGHT directly). So DOWN is not a valid input. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which direction is best. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible. So moving RIGHT would let the snake eat an apple right now, which is optimal. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head position (4,3). Moving RIGHT to (4,4) → that's 'A' (apple). So the snake eats it, grows, score increases. That's a good move. The other directions (UP, LEFT) would move to empty spaces, no apple. So choosing RIGHT would be the best choice here.\n\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n- **Snake Head Position**: (Row 4, Column 3) (marked as 'H').\n- **Current Direction**: UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- **Apples**: Positions (Row 1, Column 3), (Row 4, Column 4), (Row 5, Column 3).\n\n### Analysis of Each Valid Direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (Row 3, Column 3). This is an empty space (no apple). The snake moves but does not eat, so no score increase.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (Row 4, Column 2). This is an empty space (no apple). The snake moves but does not eat, so no score increase.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (Row 4, Column 4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. This is the most beneficial move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, let's start by understanding the current game state.\n\nThe game board is 8x8 with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S'. The apples are 'A'. The current direction is RIGHT, and the current epoch is 2, so we have 98 more epochs left. The snake can't reverse direction, so from RIGHT, it can't go LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n\nLet me first map out the current board. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  A A # (columns 2 and 4 are A)\nRow 2: #      # (empty)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #  SH  # (columns 2 is S, 3 is H)\nRow 5: #   A  # (column 3 is A)\nRow 6: #      # (empty)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the snake's head is at (4,3) assuming rows are 0-7 and columns 0-7. Because row 4 is the 5th row (since starting from 0). Let's confirm coordinates: (row, column). So row 4, column 3 is H. The body S is at (4,2), since row 4, column 2 is S. So the snake's current position is from (4,2) to (4,3), moving RIGHT. So the next move in the current direction (RIGHT) would take the head to (4,4). Let's check what's there. Row 4, column 4: the row is \"#  SH  #\", so columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: S, 3: H, 4: space, 5: space, 6: #. So (4,4) is a space. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,4), which is safe. The body would then shift: the new head is (4,4), the previous head (4,3) becomes part of the body, and the old body (4,2) would remain? Wait, no. The snake moves by adding a new head in the direction and removing the tail only if it didn't eat an apple. Since the snake's length is 2 (S and H), when moving, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (S at (4,2)) would be removed. Wait, the initial length is 1, but in the example, when the snake eats an apple, it grows. Let me check the rules again. The snake starts with length 1 (just the head). Each time it eats an apple, it grows in length. So the current snake's length: the head is H, and body is S. So that's length 2. So that means the snake has eaten 1 apple already. Because starting length 1, after eating 1 apple, length becomes 2. So current length is 2. \n\nSo when moving, the snake's movement is: new head is in the direction of movement. If the new head is on an apple, the snake grows (so the tail doesn't get removed; length increases by 1). If not, the tail is removed (so length stays the same). \n\nCurrent snake body positions: H is at (4,3), S is at (4,2). So the tail is (4,2). So when moving in direction RIGHT, the new head is (4,4). Let's check if that's an apple. (4,4) is a space, so no apple. So the snake moves: new head (4,4), body becomes (4,3), and the tail (4,2) is removed. So the new snake positions would be (4,3) as S and (4,4) as H. That's safe, no collision.\n\nNow, possible directions: current direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse, so can't go LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. RIGHT: next head position (4,4). As above, safe, no apple. The new snake would be H at (4,4), S at (4,3). No collision.\n\n2. UP: direction is UP. The current head is at (4,3). Moving UP would take it to (3,3). Let's check (3,3). Row 3 is \"#      #\", which is all spaces. So (3,3) is a space. So new head (3,3). The body would be (4,3) (previous head), and the tail (4,2) is removed (since no apple eaten). So new snake positions: S at (4,3), H at (3,3). Safe, no collision.\n\n3. DOWN: direction is DOWN. Head moves from (4,3) to (5,3). Let's check (5,3). Row 5 is \"#   A  #\", so column 3 is A. Oh, there's an apple there! So if the snake moves DOWN, the head will be at (5,3) which is an apple. So the snake eats the apple, grows in length (now length 3). So the body will be (4,3) (previous head) and (4,2) (previous body), and the new head is (5,3). So the snake's positions after moving DOWN would be: H at (5,3), S at (4,3), S at (4,2). No collision with walls (since row 5 is within 0-7) and no collision with itself (since (5,3) is new, and the body is at (4,3) and (4,2), which are different positions). So this is a good move because it eats an apple, increasing the score.\n\nSo moving DOWN would result in eating an apple, which is better than moving RIGHT or UP (which don't get an apple now). Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head position (4,3). Moving DOWN: (4+1,3) = (5,3). Row 5, column 3 is A. Correct. So yes, that's an apple. So the snake would eat it, grow, and the score increases by 1. That's better than other options. \n\nAre there any possible collisions? The new head is (5,3). The body after moving would be (4,3) and (4,2). The new head (5,3) is not overlapping with any body part, so no self-collision. The walls are at the edges (rows 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7). (5,3) is within the board, so no wall collision. So moving DOWN is safe and gains an apple. That's the best choice.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4, 3), with its body (S) at (4, 2). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. The possible directions to choose from are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (4, 4), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake's length remains 2 (tail at (4, 2) is removed). This is safe but does not increase the score.  \n- **Moving UP**: The head would move to (3, 3), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake's length remains 2 (tail at (4, 2) is removed). This is safe but does not increase the score.  \n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (5, 3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake's length to 3 (tail at (4, 2) is retained). The new head position (5, 3) does not collide with the walls or the snake's body (which would now be at (4, 3) and (4, 2)). This is safe and beneficial.  \n\nMoving DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and increase the score, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #  A A # (so positions (1,2) and (1,4) are apples)\nRow 2: #      # (empty)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #  SS  # (so positions (4,2) and (4,3) are snake body)\nRow 5: #   H  # (head at (5,3))\nRow 6: #A     # (apple at (6,1))\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. Let's confirm the head position. The head 'H' is in row 5, column 3. Since the current direction is DOWN, the next move would be to row 6, column 3, unless we change direction. But we can't reverse direction. Since current direction is DOWN, the possible directions we can choose are UP (reverse, which is not allowed), LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. Wait, no, the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is DOWN, the snake can't immediately turn UP (since that's reversing). Similarly, if moving RIGHT, can't turn LEFT, etc. So possible directions here are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since UP is reverse).\n\nNow, let's check where each possible direction would take the head.\n\nCurrent head position: (row 5, column 3). Let's note that rows are 0 (top) to 7 (bottom). So moving DOWN would take the head to row 6, column 3. Let's check what's there. Looking at row 6: #A     #. So row 6, column 3 is empty (since row 6 is: index 0 is '#', 1 is 'A', 2-6 are spaces). So (6,3) is a space.\n\nIf we choose to move LEFT: the head would go to (5,2). Let's check row 5: #   H  #. So row 5, columns 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is 'H', 4 is ' ', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So (5,2) is a space.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: head moves to (5,4). (5,4) is a space.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: head moves to (6,3). Let's check (6,3) in row 6: row 6 is #A     #. So columns 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (6,3) is ' ' (empty).\n\nNow, we need to check for collisions. Let's see the snake's body. The body is in row 4, columns 2 and 3 (since row 4 is #  SS  # → columns 2 and 3 are 'S'). The head is at (5,3). So the snake's body is at (4,2) and (4,3). The current length is 3? Wait, the snake starts with length 1 (just head). Each time it eats an apple, it grows. Let's check how many apples have been eaten so far. The current epoch is 3. The game starts with 3 apples. Let's see the initial setup. But perhaps we can count the current snake's body. The head is 'H' (1), and there are two 'S's in row 4 (columns 2 and 3). So total length is 3. That suggests the snake has eaten 2 apples (since starting length 1, each apple adds 1, so 1 + 2 = 3). So current apples on the board: original 3, minus 2 eaten, so 1 left? Wait, the current board shows apples at (1,2), (1,4), and (6,1). Let's count the 'A's: row 1 has two, row 6 has one. So 3 apples. So maybe the snake hasn't eaten any apples yet. Because initial apples are 3, and if the snake hasn't eaten any, the apples would still be there. Then the body must be from movement. Because when the snake moves, each part follows. Let's track the snake's movement.\n\nThe snake starts with direction UP. But current direction is DOWN. Let's think about the movement steps. The current epoch is 3. Let's retrace.\n\nEpoch 1: initial direction is UP. So first move is up. Let's imagine initial positions.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to look at the current positions. The head is at (5,3). The body is at (4,2) and (4,3). So the body positions are where the head was in previous steps. Let's think: when the snake moves, the head moves in the current direction, and each body segment follows the previous one. So the body segments are the previous positions of the head.\n\nSo the current head is (5,3). The body segments are (4,3) and (4,2). That suggests that in the previous move (epoch 2), the head was at (4,3), and in epoch 1, it was at (4,2). Because each time the snake moves, the body follows. Let's confirm:\n\nIf epoch 3 is the current state, then:\n\nEpoch 3: head at (5,3), body at (4,3) (from epoch 2's head), and (4,2) (from epoch 1's head). \n\nEpoch 2: head was at (4,3), direction before that? Let's see the movement. The snake's direction can't reverse. The current direction is DOWN. So in epoch 2, the direction must have been such that the movement from epoch 2 to 3 is DOWN. So from (4,3) moving DOWN would take it to (5,3), which is the current head. So epoch 2's direction was DOWN. Then epoch 1's direction must have been such that moving from (4,2) to (4,3) (since epoch 1's head is (4,2), epoch 2's head is (4,3)), so direction was RIGHT (since moving right from (4,2) would go to (4,3)). Then epoch 0 (initial) head was (4,2), direction was RIGHT. Then in epoch 1, direction changed to DOWN (since from RIGHT, you can turn DOWN (allowed, not reverse), and moved down to (5,2)? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to find the next move that allows the snake to eat an apple and avoid collision.\n\nCurrent apples are at (1,2), (1,4), (6,1). Let's see where the head can reach next.\n\nPossible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (since current direction is DOWN, can't go UP).\n\nLet's check each direction:\n\n1. DOWN: next head position (6,3). What's there? Empty. So snake moves there. The body would shift: the current body segments (4,2), (4,3) would move to (5,3) (previous head) and (4,3) (previous body). Wait, when the snake moves, all body segments follow the head. So the new body segments are the previous positions of the head. So if the head moves from (5,3) to (6,3), then the new body will be (5,3) (old head) and (4,3) (old body's first segment). The old body's second segment (4,2) would be dropped if the snake doesn't grow. But since no apple is eaten, the length remains the same (3), so the body will be (5,3) and (4,3). So the new board would have H at (6,3), S at (5,3) and (4,3).\n\nBut (6,3) is safe (no wall, no body). So that's a valid move.\n\n2. LEFT: next head position (5,2). Check if that's a body part. Current body is (4,2) and (4,3). (5,2) is empty. So safe. The body would then be (5,3) (old head) and (4,3) (old body). So new positions: H at (5,2), S at (5,3) and (4,3). That's safe.\n\n3. RIGHT: next head position (5,4). Check if that's a body part. (5,4) is empty. So safe. Body becomes (5,3) and (4,3). So H at (5,4), S at (5,3) and (4,3). Safe.\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's see which direction leads to an apple.\n\nCurrent apples are at (1,2), (1,4), (6,1). Let's check the next positions:\n\n- DOWN: (6,3) → no apple.\n- LEFT: (5,2) → no apple.\n- RIGHT: (5,4) → no apple.\n\nHmm. None of the immediate next moves have an apple. Then we need to plan for the next steps. Let's look for the closest apples.\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is in row 6, column 1. The head is at (5,3). To reach (6,1), the snake would need to move down to row 6, then left. Let's see:\n\nIf current direction is DOWN, moving to (6,3) (DOWN), then next possible directions (since direction is now DOWN, can't go UP). Then from (6,3), possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. Moving LEFT to (6,2), then LEFT again to (6,1), which is the apple. So that's two moves away.\n\nAnother apple is at (1,2). That's in row 1, column 2. The head is at row 5. To reach there, the snake would need to move up (but current direction is DOWN, so can't reverse to UP immediately. So maybe need to turn left or right first, then up.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,4). Same idea.\n\nBut the closest apple is (6,1) which is in row 6 (one row below the head's current row 5). So moving down to (6,3) (row 6), then left twice would reach (6,1).\n\nAlternatively, if we turn LEFT now (from (5,3) to (5,2)), then direction could be LEFT, then move left to (5,1), then down to (6,1) (apple at (6,1)). Let's check:\n\nCurrent head (5,3). Move LEFT to (5,2) (direction LEFT). Then next move can't reverse (so can't go RIGHT). So possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT. If direction is LEFT again, move to (5,1). Then next direction could be DOWN (from LEFT, can turn DOWN), move to (6,1), which is the apple. That's three moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first (to (6,3)), then LEFT (to (6,2)), then LEFT (to (6,1)) which is the apple. That's three moves as well.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better path. Let's check if any direction leads to a position that's adjacent to an apple.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if moving DOWN is better. Because the snake is currently moving DOWN, and if we continue in that direction, it's possible to reach the apple in (6,1) faster.\n\nWait, let's think about the body positions. The current body is (4,2) and (4,3). If we move DOWN to (6,3), the new body positions would be (5,3) (old head) and (4,3) (old body). So the body would be at (5,3) and (4,3). Then, next move if we go LEFT to (6,2), body becomes (6,3) (old head), (5,3) (old body). Then next move LEFT to (6,1) (apple). That's safe.\n\nIf we choose to move LEFT now, the new head is (5,2), body is (5,3) and (4,3). Then next move LEFT to (5,1), body is (5,2) and (5,3). Then next move DOWN to (6,1) (apple). That's also safe.\n\nBut which path is better? Let's check if there are any obstacles. The walls are around, so edges are safe as long as we don't hit them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT. The head would go to (5,4). Then possible directions: RIGHT (can't reverse if previous direction was RIGHT), UP, DOWN. Let's see. (5,4) is empty. Then next move could be UP, but current direction would be RIGHT (if we turned RIGHT), then next direction can't be LEFT. So from (5,4), moving UP to (4,4). Then (4,4) is empty (row 4 is #  SS  #, so columns 2 and 3 are S, 4 is empty). Then moving UP to (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4) which is an apple. That's a longer path (four moves), but possible.\n\nBut the closest apples are (6,1) and (1,2), (1,4). (6,1) is in row 6, which is one row below the current head (row 5). So perhaps the best path is to go towards (6,1).\n\nSo, if we move DOWN now (current direction is DOWN, allowed), then next step can move LEFT towards (6,1). Let's confirm the movement:\n\nCurrent head (5,3), direction DOWN. Move to (6,3). Then, direction can be LEFT (since previous direction was DOWN, turning LEFT is allowed). Then move to (6,2). Then direction LEFT again, move to (6,1) (apple). So in three steps, we can reach that apple. That seems feasible.\n\nAlternatively, if we move LEFT now, then next steps to reach (6,1) would be:\n\nMove LEFT to (5,2). Then direction LEFT (allowed), move to (5,1). Then direction DOWN (allowed), move to (6,1) (apple). That's also three steps. So either path works.\n\nBut are there any collision risks? Let's check.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (6,3), the new body positions are (5,3) and (4,3). So (6,3) is safe (no body, no wall). Then moving LEFT to (6,2): body becomes (6,3) and (5,3). Safe. Then moving LEFT to (6,1): that's the apple. Eating it would increase the score, and the snake would grow. The new head is (6,1), and the body would be (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). That's safe.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (5,2): new body (5,3), (4,3). Safe. Then LEFT to (5,1): body (5,2), (5,3). Safe. Then DOWN to (6,1): body (5,1), (5,2). Then eat the apple. Also safe.\n\nSo both paths are possible. But which direction should we choose now? The question is to pick the best direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) that leads to eating an apple as soon as possible and avoids collision.\n\nSince the current direction is DOWN, and moving DOWN is allowed, and that path leads towards the apple in row 6, perhaps moving DOWN is the best choice. Alternatively, moving LEFT could also work.\n\nWait, let's check the apple at (6,1). The head is at (5,3). The distance (Manhattan) is (6-5) + (3-1) = 1 + 2 = 3. So three steps. If we move DOWN, then LEFT twice, that's three steps. If we move LEFT, then LEFT, then DOWN, that's three steps. So same number of steps.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's body. Let's see the current body positions. The body is at (4,2) and (4,3). If the snake moves DOWN, the new body positions are (5,3) and (4,3). So (5,3) is the old head. Then, moving LEFT from (6,3) to (6,2) would have the body at (6,3) and (5,3). Then moving LEFT to (6,1) would have the body at (6,2) and (6,3). No collision.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT, the new body is (5,3) and (4,3). Then moving LEFT to (5,1), the body is (5,2) and (5,3). Then moving DOWN to (6,1), the body is (5,1) and (5,2). All safe.\n\nSo both directions (DOWN and LEFT) are possible. But perhaps moving DOWN is better because it continues the current direction, which might be more straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps there's another apple closer. Let's check the other apples.\n\nApple at (1,2): row 1, column 2. The head is at (5,3). Manhattan distance: (5-1) + (3-2) =4 +1=5 steps. Apple at (1,4): (5-1)+(4-3)=4+1=5 steps. So (6,1) is closer (distance 3). So best to aim for (6,1).\n\nSo the next move should be either DOWN or LEFT. Which is better?\n\nIf we choose DOWN, the next position is (6,3). Then we can turn LEFT. If we choose LEFT, next position is (5,2). Then we can turn LEFT again. Let's see if there's any immediate danger. For example, if the snake moves RIGHT, would that lead to a possible collision in the future? Probably not, but there's no apple in that direction.\n\nSo between DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Since RIGHT doesn't lead towards any apple, probably not the best. So between DOWN and LEFT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving DOWN is better because the snake is already moving down, and changing direction to LEFT might not be necessary yet. Let's think about the next step after moving DOWN. The head is at (6,3). Then, the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (since can't reverse to UP). Moving LEFT would take it to (6,2), which is empty. Then again LEFT to (6,1), which is the apple. That's a clear path.\n\nSo I think the best direction is DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#   H  #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (row 5, column 3). Body (S) segments are at (row 4, column 2) and (row 4, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 1, column 2), (row 1, column 4), and (row 6, column 1). The closest apple is at (row 6, column 1) (Manhattan distance: 3).\n- **Possible Moves**: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since UP is reversed and invalid).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (row 6, column 3). This position is empty (no walls or body collisions). From here, the snake can then move LEFT twice to reach the apple at (row 6, column 1) in subsequent steps.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 5, column 2). This position is also safe, but reaching the closest apple (row 6, column 1) would require additional steps (LEFT to (row 5, column 1), then DOWN to (row 6, column 1)).\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (row 5, column 4). This position is safe but does not lead toward any apple quickly (the closest apples are farther away).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN keeps the snake on a direct path toward the closest apple at (row 6, column 1) with minimal steps, avoiding collisions. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#A  H  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, and the current epoch is 4. The snake's head is 'H', and the body segments are 'S'. The apples are 'A's. \n\nFirst, let's locate the snake's position. The head 'H' is in row 6 (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top, but maybe the first line is row 0). Let's check each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  A A # (so positions (1,2) and (1,4) are apples)\nRow 2: #      # (empty)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #   S  # (so (4,3) is S)\nRow 5: #   S  # (so (5,3) is S)\nRow 6: #A  H  # (so (6,1) is A, (6,4) is H)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the head H is at (6,4). The body segments are at (5,3) and (4,3). The snake's current direction is DOWN. Since the snake can't reverse direction, if current direction is DOWN, the possible directions the player can input are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (since reversing would be UP to DOWN, but current is DOWN, so reversing would be moving UP, but wait, no: the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction, i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly. So if current direction is DOWN, the snake can't turn to UP (since that's reversing). Wait, let me recheck the rule: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Oh, so the examples given are UP→DOWN (reverse) and LEFT→RIGHT (reverse). So the reverse of UP is DOWN, reverse of DOWN is UP. Reverse of LEFT is RIGHT, reverse of RIGHT is LEFT. So if current direction is DOWN, the snake cannot choose UP as the new direction, because that's reversing. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since moving in the same direction is allowed). Wait, but the player can choose to continue moving in the same direction, right? Because the problem says the player provides direction inputs, but the snake moves in the direction it's facing. Wait, perhaps the direction input is the new direction, but it can't be the reverse of the current direction. So current direction is DOWN, possible new directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since UP is the reverse and not allowed).\n\nNow, the snake is moving in the current direction (DOWN) unless the player changes direction (to LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN; but not UP). Let's see where the head would move next if we choose each possible direction.\n\nFirst, the current head position is (6,4). Let's confirm the coordinates. Let's index rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7). Columns from left (column 0) to right (column 7). So each row is 8 characters. So row 6 is \"#A  H  #\", which has columns 0 to 7:\n\nRow 6:\n0: #\n1: A\n2:  \n3:  \n4: H\n5:  \n6:  \n7: #\n\nSo H is at (row 6, column 4). \n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So moving DOWN would take the head to row 7, column 4. But row 7 is all # (walls). So if the snake moves DOWN, it will hit the wall, game over. That's bad. So we can't choose DOWN.\n\nNext, possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT (since UP is reverse of DOWN, which is not allowed). Let's check LEFT. LEFT direction: the head would move to (6,3). Let's check what's at (6,3). Row 6, column 3 is a space (since row 6 is \"#A  H  #\": columns 0=#,1=A,2= ,3= ,4=H,5= ,6= ,7=#). So (6,3) is empty. So moving LEFT would take the head to (6,3). Then, we need to check if that's a collision with the body. The body segments are at (5,3) and (4,3). The new head position is (6,3). The body is at (5,3) (row 5, column 3) and (4,3) (row 4, column 3). So (6,3) is not a body part. So that's safe. Also, is there an apple there? (6,3) is a space, so no apple. So the snake would move, and the body would follow. The snake's length is 3 (head plus two S's). So when moving, the head moves to (6,3), and the body segments shift: the last S (at 4,3) would be removed, and the new body segments would be (6,4) (old head) and (5,3) (old body). So the new board would have S at (6,4), (5,3), and the head at (6,3).\n\nNow, check RIGHT direction. RIGHT direction: head moves to (6,5). Let's check (6,5). That's a space (row 6, column 5 is a space). Is there a body part there? The body is at (5,3) and (4,3). (6,5) is not a body part. So that's safe. Also, no apple there. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nWhat about UP direction? Wait, current direction is DOWN, so the snake can't reverse direction. So UP is not allowed. Because the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly). So if current direction is DOWN, turning to UP is reversing. So UP is invalid. So the player can't choose UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. But moving DOWN would hit the wall (row 7 is a wall). So DOWN is invalid (causes game over). So only LEFT and RIGHT are possible.\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's check where the apples are. The apples are at (1,2), (1,4), and (6,1). Let's see where those are. \n\nApple at (1,2): row 1, column 2.\n\nApple at (1,4): row 1, column 4.\n\nApple at (6,1): row 6, column 1 (current position, but the head is at (6,4), so that's an apple in the same row, column 1).\n\nNow, the snake's current position. Let's think about the path to the apples. The snake's body is at (5,3) and (4,3). So the body is in a vertical line from (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,4) (head). So the snake's body is like a line going up from (6,4) to (5,3) (maybe a diagonal? Because (6,4) to (5,3) is moving up-left). Then (5,3) to (4,3) is up (same column).\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT (to (6,3)), then next move, possible directions. Let's see. The new direction would be LEFT (since the player chose LEFT, so the current direction becomes LEFT). Then, the next move would be in LEFT direction. Let's see where that would take the head. (6,3) moving LEFT would go to (6,2). Is (6,2) a wall? No, row 6, column 2 is a space. Then, (6,2) is adjacent to (6,1), which is an apple. So moving LEFT again would reach (6,1) which is an apple. That's a good path.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT (to (6,5)), then the next direction would be RIGHT, and moving RIGHT again would take the head to (6,6), which is a space, then (6,7) which is a wall (since row 6, column 7 is #). So that's a dead end. Alternatively, maybe turning up or down, but after moving RIGHT, the current direction would be RIGHT, so the next possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (can't reverse to LEFT). But (6,5) moving UP would go to (5,5). Let's check (5,5): row 5 is \"#   S  #\", so (5,3) is S, (5,5) is space. Then moving UP to (5,5) is safe. But there's no apple there. The apples are in row 1. So perhaps moving LEFT is better because it's leading towards the apple at (6,1).\n\nAlternatively, the current apple at (6,1) is in the same row as the head (row 6). The head is at (6,4). So to reach (6,1), the head needs to move left three times (from 4→3→2→1). Let's see if that's possible.\n\nCurrent move options:\n\nOption 1: Move LEFT. New head position (6,3). Body becomes (6,4) (old head) and (5,3) (old body). So the new body positions are (6,4), (5,3). Then, next move (epoch 5), direction could be LEFT again (since current direction would be LEFT). Then head moves to (6,2). Check if (6,2) is safe. The body would be (6,3) (old head), (6,4) (old body). So (6,2) is not a body part, and not a wall. Then, epoch 6, direction LEFT again. Head moves to (6,1), which is an apple. Eating that apple would increase the score, and the snake would grow. So that's a good path.\n\nOption 2: Move RIGHT. New head (6,5). Body (6,4), (5,3). Then, next move direction RIGHT, head (6,6). Then next move RIGHT to (6,7), which is a wall. Game over. So that's bad. Alternatively, after moving RIGHT once, maybe change direction to UP. Let's see: moving RIGHT (epoch 4), head (6,5). Current direction is RIGHT. Then, epoch 5, direction UP (allowed, since current direction is RIGHT, reverse is LEFT. So UP is allowed). Then head moves to (5,5). Is (5,5) safe? The body would be (6,5) (old head), (6,4) (old body). (5,5) is empty. Then epoch 6, direction UP again, head (4,5). Then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5). Row 1 is \"#  A A #\", so (1,5) is a space (since (1,2) and (1,4) are A's). (1,5) is a space. Then (0,5) is a wall (row 0 is ########). So that's a dead end. No apples in that path.\n\nSo the best option is to move LEFT, leading towards the apple at (6,1). So the direction to choose is LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#A  H  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (row 6, column 4). Body segments (S) are at (row 5, column 3) and (row 4, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so UP is invalid.\n- **Walls**: The board is bordered by '#' (row 0 and row 7 are walls).\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 1, column 2), (row 1, column 4), and (row 6, column 1).\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (6,4) would take the head to (7,4), which is a wall. This causes a collision and ends the game. **Invalid**.\n2. **UP**: Reverses the current direction (DOWN → UP), which is not allowed. **Invalid**.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (6,4) takes the head to (6,5) (empty, no collision). However, continuing RIGHT would lead to (6,6) → (6,7) (wall), a dead end. No apples in this path.\n4. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (6,4) takes the head to (6,3) (empty, no collision). This direction leads toward the apple at (6,1) (row 6, column 1). Subsequent LEFT moves would reach the apple, increasing the score and growing the snake.\n\nThe safest and most beneficial direction is LEFT, as it avoids walls\/self-collision and leads toward an apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, let's start by understanding the current game board. The user said to repeat the game board first, so let me write that out.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#A HS  #\n########\n\nSo the board is 8x8. Let's parse each row. The top and bottom are all '#' (walls). Let's look at each row from top to bottom (row 0 to row 7 maybe? Or 1 to 8? Probably rows 1 to 6 are the play area, with row 0 and 7 being walls).\n\nRow 0: ######## (wall)\nRow 1: #  A A # → positions 2 and 4 are apples (A)\nRow 2: #      # → empty\nRow 3: #      # → empty\nRow 4: #      # → empty\nRow 5: #   S  # → position 4 is S (snake body)\nRow 6: #A HS  # → let's break this down. The characters are: #, A, space, H, S, space, space, #. So positions 1 is A, 3 is H (head), 4 is S (body).\nRow 7: ######## (wall)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. Let's track the snake's position. The head is at row 6, column 3 (assuming columns are 0-based). Because in row 6, the string is \"#A HS  #\", so index 0 is '#', 1 is 'A', 2 is ' ', 3 is 'H', 4 is 'S', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So H is at (6,3). The body S is at (6,4) and (5,4) (from row 5: #   S  # → S is at (5,4)). So the snake's body is (5,4) and (6,4), and head is (6,3). So the snake's current direction is LEFT, so moving left would take the head to (6,2).\n\nNow, the snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is LEFT, so the possible directions to turn are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. Because reversing would be RIGHT (since LEFT's opposite is RIGHT), which is not allowed. So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Continue moving LEFT (current direction). The head is at (6,3). Moving left would take it to (6,2). Let's check what's at (6,2). Looking at row 6: \"#A HS  #\", position 2 is a space. So that's empty. Then, since the snake is moving, the body would follow. The current body segments are (6,4) and (5,4). When moving, the head moves to (6,2), the next segment (previous head) is (6,3), then (6,4), then (5,4). Wait, the snake's length is 3? Because there's H at (6,3), S at (6,4) and (5,4). So length 3. So when moving, the new head is (6,2), then the body segments are (6,3), (6,4), (5,4). Now, check if (6,2) is a wall or body. (6,2) is within the play area (rows 1-6, columns 1-6). Column 2 is within 1-6. So not a wall. The body segments are (6,3), (6,4), (5,4). The new head (6,2) is not in those positions, so no collision. So moving LEFT is safe here.\n\nWhat's at (6,2)? The current cell is a space. So no apple. So the snake doesn't grow, just moves. The apple in row 6, column 1 is at (6,1). So if moving LEFT again next time, the head would go to (6,1), which is an apple. But that's next step.\n\n2. Direction UP: The snake is moving LEFT, turning UP. Is that allowed? Yes, because UP is not the reverse (reverse is RIGHT). So moving UP. The head (6,3) moving UP would go to (5,3). Let's check (5,3). Row 5 is \"#   S  #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (5,3) is a space. So that's empty. Then, the new head is (5,3). The body would be (6,3) (old head), (6,4), (5,4). Check collision: (5,3) is not in the body positions (6,3), (6,4), (5,4). So safe. Also, (5,3) is not a wall (row 5 is within 1-6). So moving UP is safe.\n\n3. Direction DOWN: The snake is moving LEFT, turning DOWN. DOWN is allowed (not reverse). The head (6,3) moving DOWN would go to (7,3). But row 7 is the bottom wall (all '#'). So (7,3) is a wall. So moving DOWN would cause a collision with the wall. So that's invalid, game over. So DOWN is not allowed.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT and UP. Now, which is better? Let's check for apples. The apples are at:\n\nRow 1: columns 2 and 4 (positions (1,2), (1,4)).\n\nRow 6: column 1 (position (6,1)).\n\nCurrent head is at (6,3). Let's see where apples are. The apple at (6,1) is to the left of the head. The apples in row 1 are above.\n\nIf we move LEFT, the next position is (6,2), which is empty. Then, next move LEFT again would reach (6,1) (the apple). That would be good. So moving LEFT now allows the snake to reach that apple next step.\n\nIf we move UP to (5,3), then what's around (5,3)? Let's see. The body is at (5,4). So (5,3) is adjacent to (5,4) (to the left). The next move from (5,3) could be UP (to (4,3)), LEFT (to (5,2)), or RIGHT (but can't reverse from UP, so if current direction becomes UP, then possible directions would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since reverse is DOWN)). Wait, direction after moving UP would be UP. So next direction options would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since reverse is DOWN).\n\nBut maybe moving UP now would lead the snake towards the apples in row 1, but that's a bit far. The apple at (6,1) is closer. So perhaps moving LEFT to get that apple next step is better.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT now is safe, and moving UP is safe. But which is better? Let's check if moving UP could lead to a collision in the next steps. Let's see, after moving UP to (5,3), the body is (6,3), (6,4), (5,4). So the snake's body is (5,3) [head], (6,3), (6,4), (5,4). Next move direction could be UP (to (4,3)), LEFT (to (5,2)), or RIGHT (to (5,4) which is body → collision). Oh, if direction is RIGHT, then the head would move to (5,4), which is part of the body. So moving RIGHT would be bad. So after moving UP, the next possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (but RIGHT is dangerous). So perhaps moving LEFT is better as it's a safer path towards an apple.\n\nAnother thing: the snake's current length is 3. When it eats an apple, it grows. So the apple at (6,1) is a good target. So moving LEFT now, then LEFT again would reach that apple. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head (6,3). Move LEFT → (6,2). Then next move LEFT → (6,1), which is the apple. So eating that apple would increase the score and the snake grows. That's a good plan. So moving LEFT now is the best option.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#A HS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (6, 3) (row 6, column 3), with body segments ('S') at (6, 4) and (5, 4). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. Possible directions to choose are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (but DOWN leads to a wall collision).\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (6, 2), which is empty (no wall or body collision). This keeps the snake on a path toward the apple at (6, 1) (left of (6, 2)), allowing it to eat the apple in the next move.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (5, 3), which is empty (no collision). However, this moves the snake away from the nearby apple at (6, 1) and may limit future movement options.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (7, 3), which is a wall (game over).  \n\nThe safest and most optimal choice is to continue moving LEFT to approach the nearby apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list out each row to visualize it better:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #  A A # (so positions (1,2) and (1,4) are apples)\nRow 2: #      # (empty)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #      # (empty)\nRow 5: #      # (empty)\nRow 6: #AHSS  # (so positions (6,1)=A, (6,2)=H (head), (6,3)=S (body), (6,4)=S (body))\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. Let's confirm the snake's body positions. The head is at (6,2) (row 6, column 2). Since the direction is LEFT, the snake was moving left, so the previous positions would be head moving left. Let's track the body:\n\nThe snake's body is 'S's. The head is H at (6,2). Then the next body segment is S at (6,3), then another S at (6,4). So the snake's body is in a line from (6,2) (H) to (6,3) (S) to (6,4) (S). So the length is 3 (H + 2 S's). \n\nNow, the snake is currently moving LEFT. The next move would be in the current direction unless we change direction, but we can't reverse. Since current direction is LEFT, the possible directions we can choose are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT (since reversing would be RIGHT, which is not allowed). Wait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So if current direction is LEFT, the allowed directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing would be RIGHT, which is the opposite, so that's not allowed). So possible next directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nWe need to choose a direction that doesn't cause collision (with walls or self) and preferably eats an apple. Let's check where the head would move in each possible direction.\n\nCurrent head position: (6,2) (row 6, column 2). Let's note that rows are 0 (top) to 7 (bottom), columns 0 (left) to 7 (right).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So if we keep moving LEFT, the next head position would be (6, 2-1) = (6,1). Let's check that position. Looking at row 6: #AHSS  #. So (6,1) is 'A' (apple). So moving LEFT would take the head to (6,1), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple increases the score and the snake grows.\n\nWhat happens if we move LEFT? Let's see. The head moves to (6,1) (which is A). Then, since the snake eats the apple, the body doesn't shorten. The previous head (6,2) becomes part of the body. So the new body segments would be (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), and the new head is (6,1). So the snake's length increases by 1. Also, that position is not a wall (since (6,1) is inside the board, as the walls are at columns 0 and 7). So no collision with walls here. Also, check if the new head position (6,1) is part of the body. The current body is (6,3) and (6,4). So (6,1) is not part of the body, so no self-collision. So moving LEFT is safe and will eat an apple. That's a good move.\n\nWhat about other directions? Let's check UP. If we turn UP, the direction becomes UP. The next head position would be (6-1, 2) = (5,2). Let's check (5,2). Row 5 is #      #, so (5,2) is empty (no wall, no body). So moving UP would take the head to (5,2). Is that safe? The body is (6,3), (6,4). So (5,2) is not part of the body, so no collision. But there's no apple there, so the snake doesn't eat anything. The body would then shift: the previous head (6,2) becomes S, then (6,3) becomes S, (6,4) remains S, and the new head is (5,2). So the snake moves up, but doesn't gain length.\n\nWhat about DOWN? Direction becomes DOWN. Next head position is (6+1, 2) = (7,2). But row 7 is the bottom wall (all #). So (7,2) is a wall. So moving DOWN would cause a collision with the wall, ending the game. That's bad. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT, UP, or continue LEFT (since LEFT is current direction, but we can choose to keep moving LEFT). Wait, the current direction is LEFT. The player can input a direction, which can be LEFT (same direction), UP, or DOWN (since RIGHT is reverse). So the options are LEFT, UP, DOWN. But DOWN leads to a wall. So only LEFT and UP are possible.\n\nIf we choose LEFT, we eat the apple at (6,1). That's a good move. If we choose UP, we move to (5,2) which is safe but no apple. So the best choice is LEFT, because it allows eating an apple, increasing the score, and the snake grows. So the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AHSS  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 6, column 2). The body ('S') follows at (6,3) and (6,4). The snake is currently moving LEFT.\n2. **Possible Directions**: Since the current direction is LEFT, the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. Valid directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n3. **Collision Checks**:\n   - **LEFT**: Next head position is (6,1). This cell contains an apple ('A'), so eating it is safe (no wall\/self-collision). The snake grows, and the score increases.\n   - **UP**: Next head position is (5,2). This cell is empty (no apple, no collision), but the snake does not grow.\n   - **DOWN**: Next head position is (7,2), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game.\n\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and avoid collisions. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#HSSS  #\n########\n\nSo, the board is 8x8, with walls (#######) around the edges. The snake's head is 'H' in the 7th row (since rows are 0-indexed or 1-indexed? Let's count. The first line is row 0: ########, then row 1: #  A A #, row 2: #    A #, row 3: #      #, row 4: #      #, row 5: #      #, row 6: #HSSS  #, row 7: ########. So the head 'H' is in row 6, column 1 (since columns are 0-indexed; the row 6 is \"#HSSS  #\", so positions are 0: #, 1:H, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #). \n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. Let's remember that the snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is LEFT, the opposite direction is RIGHT. So the snake can't turn RIGHT immediately. Possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. But we need to check which directions are safe and which can get an apple.\n\nFirst, let's track the snake's body. The head is at (6,1). The body segments are S in (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). Because the snake was moving LEFT, the previous positions would have the head moving left, so the body follows. So the snake's length is 4 (H + 3 S's). \n\nThe snake moves one square in the chosen direction. Let's think about each possible direction:\n\n1. Continue moving LEFT (current direction). The next head position would be (6,0). But (6,0) is a wall (since the row 6 starts with # at column 0). So moving LEFT would cause a wall collision, which ends the game. That's bad. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n2. Direction UP: The head would move from (6,1) to (5,1). Let's check if (5,1) is a wall or body. The row 5 is \"#      #\", so column 1 is a space. The snake's body is in (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). So (5,1) is empty. So moving UP is possible. Are there any apples in (5,1)? Let's check the board. Row 5 is \"#      #\", which has no A. So moving UP would just move the head there, and the body would follow. The tail (the last S) would move forward, so the new body would be (6,1) (old head), (6,2), (6,3) as the new body. The new head is (5,1). That's safe.\n\n3. Direction DOWN: The head is at (6,1). Moving DOWN would take it to (7,1). But row 7 is ########, which is a wall. So (7,1) is a wall. Collision. So DOWN is invalid.\n\n4. Direction RIGHT: The current direction is LEFT, so reversing to RIGHT is not allowed. Because the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction (UP to DOWN, LEFT to RIGHT directly). So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo the only possible directions are UP. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (current), but:\n\n- LEFT: (6,0) is wall. Die.\n- DOWN: (7,1) is wall. Die.\n- RIGHT: reverse direction, not allowed.\n- UP: (5,1) is safe. No collision. No apple there. So moving UP is the only safe option.\n\nWait, but are there any apples that we can reach? Let's check where the apples are. The apples are in row 1: \"#  A A #\", which is row 1. Let's parse row 1: columns 2 and 4 (since 0 is #, 1: space, 2:A, 3: space, 4:A, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #). So apples at (1,2) and (1,4). Row 2: \"#    A #\", which is column 4 (0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4:A, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #). So apple at (2,4).\n\nSo the apples are at (1,2), (1,4), (2,4). The snake's head is at (6,1). To reach these apples, the snake needs to move upwards. Let's see the path. If the snake moves UP, next position (5,1). Then, maybe continue moving UP again. Let's see if that's possible. The next step after UP would be (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). Then, from (1,1), moving right to (1,2) which is an apple. That would be a good path. So moving UP now is the way to go towards the apples. \n\nSo the correct direction is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#HSSS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is located at row 6, column 1. The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Let's analyze possible moves:\n\n1. **LEFT**: The head would move to (6,0), which is a wall (row 6 starts with '#'). This causes a wall collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n2. **DOWN**: The head would move to (7,1), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). This causes a wall collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n3. **RIGHT**: Reversing the current direction (LEFT → RIGHT) is not allowed. **Invalid**.\n4. **UP**: The head moves to (5,1). Row 5, column 1 is empty (no wall or snake body). This is a safe move. No apple is present at (5,1), but moving UP allows the snake to continue toward the apples located in the upper rows (e.g., (1,2), (1,4), (2,4)).\n\nThe only valid and safe direction is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#H     #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the current epoch is 8. The snake's head is at position (5,1) if we count rows from top as 0. Wait, let's index the rows properly. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (so columns 0-7 are all #)\nRow 1: #  A A # → columns 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is space, 3 is A, 4 is space, 5 is A, 6 is space, 7 is #\nRow 2: #    A # → columns 0 is #, 1-3 are spaces, 4 is A, 5-6 spaces, 7 is #\nRow 3: #      # → all spaces between #\nRow 4: #      # → same\nRow 5: #H     # → column 1 is H (since row 5, columns 0 is #, 1 is H, 2-6 spaces, 7 is #)\nRow 6: #SSS   # → row 6, columns 0 is #, 1,2,3 are S, 4-6 spaces, 7 is #\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is in row 5, column 1. The body (S) is in row 6, columns 1,2,3. Since the current direction is UP, the snake is moving upwards. When the snake moves, the head moves in the direction, and the body follows. Since the snake's length is 4 (H plus 3 S's), each move, the head moves, and the last body segment (the tail) is removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is UP, the snake can't turn DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because reversing would be DOWN (since moving UP, turning DOWN is 180, which is not allowed). So allowed directions are UP (continue), LEFT (turn 90 left from UP), RIGHT (turn 90 right from UP).\n\nLet's think about the next move. The current head is at (5,1) (row 5, column 1). Moving UP would take it to row 4, column 1. Let's check what's there. Row 4, column 1 is a space (since row 4 is \"#      #\", so columns 1-6 are spaces). So moving UP: new head position (4,1). Then the body segments would shift. The previous head (5,1) becomes S, and the tail (row 6, column 3) would be removed if no apple is eaten.\n\nWait, but first, check if moving in the chosen direction would cause a collision. Let's evaluate each possible direction.\n\nPossible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCurrent direction is UP. Let's check each:\n\n1. UP: Next position is (4,1). What's at (4,1)? It's a space (row 4: \"#      #\", so (4,1) is space). So no collision with walls (since walls are at row 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7). The new head is (4,1). The body would be (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). Because the tail was (6,3), which would be removed. So no collision with body. So moving UP is safe.\n\n2. LEFT: Direction LEFT. Since current direction is UP, turning LEFT is allowed (not reverse). Moving LEFT from (5,1) would take the head to (5,0). But (5,0) is a wall (column 0 is #). So collision with wall. That's bad, game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n3. RIGHT: Direction RIGHT. Current direction is UP, turning RIGHT is allowed. Moving RIGHT from (5,1) → (5,2). What's at (5,2)? It's a space (row 5 is \"#H     #\", so (5,2) is space). So new head is (5,2). Check for collision with body. The body is at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). (5,2) is not in the body positions, so no collision. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nNow, check if any of these directions lead to eating an apple. Let's see where the apples are. The apples are in row 1 (columns 3 and 5), row 2 (column 4).\n\nIf moving UP to (4,1): (4,1) is space, no apple. So no growth. The tail (6,3) would be removed. The new body would be (5,1), (6,1), (6,2).\n\nIf moving RIGHT to (5,2): (5,2) is space. No apple. So tail (6,3) is removed. Body becomes (5,1), (6,1), (6,2).\n\nSo neither direction immediately gets an apple. But maybe we need to plan ahead. Let's think about the snake's path. The snake is currently in row 5 (H at 5,1), body in row 6 (1,2,3). The direction is UP. The snake is moving upwards. Let's see where the apples are. The apples are in row 1 (A at 1,3 and 1,5), row 2 (A at 2,4). The snake's head is in row 5. So moving UP would take it towards row 4, then 3, 2, 1. If the snake continues moving UP, in the next steps, it can reach row 2 (where there's an A at (2,4)), then row 1 (A at (1,3) and (1,5)).\n\nIf the snake turns RIGHT, direction becomes RIGHT, so next move would be to (5,2). Then the next direction could be UP (since current direction is RIGHT, can't reverse to LEFT. So possible directions would be UP, RIGHT, DOWN (but DOWN is reverse of UP, but current direction is RIGHT now. Wait, no. The direction reversal rule is that you can't reverse direction. So if the current direction is RIGHT, you can't turn LEFT (since that's 180 degrees). So directions allowed would be RIGHT, UP, DOWN.\n\nBut perhaps the best path is to continue moving UP towards the apples. Because moving LEFT is into a wall (invalid), moving RIGHT is safe but takes the snake to the right, possibly away from the apples. Let's check the positions again.\n\nCurrent head: (5,1). Moving UP: (4,1). Next move (epoch 9) direction could be UP again, leading to (3,1). Then (2,1), (1,1). At row 2, (2,1) is space, (2,4) is A. So if the snake is at (2,1), and direction is UP, then next step would be (1,1). Then, to reach the A at (2,4), the snake would need to turn RIGHT. Let's see:\n\nIf snake continues UP:\n\nEpoch 8: head at (5,1) direction UP.\n\nEpoch 9: move UP → (4,1). Direction remains UP (or player can change to LEFT\/RIGHT, but can't reverse).\n\nEpoch 10: move UP → (3,1). Direction UP.\n\nEpoch 11: move UP → (2,1). Now, (2,4) is A. So from (2,1), if direction is RIGHT, then moving RIGHT would take head to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) (where A is). So that's 3 steps. So if the snake continues UP, then turns RIGHT when possible, it can reach the A in row 2.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake turns RIGHT now (epoch 8, direction RIGHT), head moves to (5,2). Then, direction could be UP (allowed, since current direction is RIGHT, turning UP is 90 degrees). So epoch 9: direction UP, head moves to (4,2). Epoch 10: direction UP → (3,2). Epoch 11: direction UP → (2,2). Then direction RIGHT to (2,3), (2,4) (A). So similar steps.\n\nBut in the current step (epoch 8), the possible directions are UP, LEFT (invalid), RIGHT. So LEFT is invalid. So the options are UP or RIGHT. Which is better?\n\nMoving UP keeps the snake moving towards the upper part of the board where the apples are. Moving RIGHT would take it to the right, but the snake's body is in row 6, columns 1-3, so there's space to the right. But since moving UP is safe and leads towards the apples, that's probably the better choice. So the answer should be UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#H     #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at row 5, column 1 (H), and its body (S) occupies row 6, columns 1-3. The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The possible directions to choose from are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,1) would take the head to (5,0), which is a wall (#). This causes a collision, ending the game. Thus, LEFT is invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5,1) takes the head to (5,2), a safe empty space (no collision with walls or the snake's body). However, this direction moves the snake away from the apples located in the upper rows.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP from (5,1) takes the head to (4,1), a safe empty space. This direction keeps the snake moving toward the upper part of the board where apples are located (row 1 has two apples, row 2 has one apple). Continuing upward increases the snake's proximity to the apples, which is optimal for eating them and growing.  \n\nSince UP is safe and strategically better for reaching apples, the best choice is UP.  \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, let's look at the current game board. The board is 8x8 with walls as '#'. Let me parse the current board step by step.\n\nThe board rows from top to bottom are:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  A A # (positions (1,2) and (1,4) are apples)\nRow 2: #    A # (position (2,4) is an apple)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #H     # (head at (4,1))\nRow 5: #S     # (body at (5,1))\nRow 6: #SS    # (bodies at (6,1) and (6,2))\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. The snake's body is behind the head. Let's track the snake's body positions. The head is at (4,1). Then the body segments are: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So the snake's length is 4 (since head is 1, and 3 body segments, total 4). \n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because reversing would be turning to the opposite direction (UP to DOWN is reverse, which is not allowed).\n\nNow, let's think about the next move. The snake moves one square in the direction chosen. Let's consider each possible direction:\n\n1. Current direction is UP. If we keep moving UP, the head will go from (4,1) to (3,1). Let's check if that's a valid position.\n\nRow 3, column 1: The cell (3,1) is empty (since row 3 is \"#      #\", so columns 1 is a space). So that's safe. Then, after moving, the snake's new head is (3,1). The body would follow: the previous head (4,1) becomes body, then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) shift. Since no apple is there, the snake's length remains the same. So no apple eaten here.\n\n2. Direction LEFT: The head is at (4,1). Moving left would take it to (4,0). But (4,0) is a wall (since row 4 starts with '#', which is column 0). So that's a collision with the wall. The game would end. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT: The head (4,1) moving right would go to (4,2). Let's check that cell. Row 4 is \"#H     #\", so after H (column 1) is column 2, which is a space. So (4,2) is empty. So that's safe. Then the new head is (4,2). Body follows. No apple here, so no growth.\n\n4. Direction DOWN: But current direction is UP, so can't reverse. So DOWN is not allowed. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. But LEFT is invalid (wall), so only UP and RIGHT.\n\nWait, wait. Let me confirm the positions again. The head is in row 4, column 1. Let's index rows from 0 (top) to 7 (bottom). So row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom.\n\nCurrent head position: (row 4, column 1). Because row 4 is \"#H     #\", which is columns 0 (wall), 1 (H), 2-6 (spaces), 7 (wall). So column 1 is H's position.\n\nIf direction is UP: moving up would be to row 3, column 1. Let's check row 3: \"#      #\". Columns 0 (wall), 1 (space), 2-6 (spaces), 7 (wall). So (3,1) is a space. So that's safe.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: moving right to row 4, column 2. Which is a space (since row 4 is \"#H     #\", H is at 1, 2 is space). So that's safe.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: moving left to row 4, column 0. That's a wall (column 0 is always '#'), so collision. So invalid.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: current direction is UP, so can't reverse. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nNow, the snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's check where the apples are. Apples are in row 1 (columns 2 and 4), row 2 (column 4). So positions (1,2), (1,4), (2,4).\n\nThe snake's current position is (4,1). Let's see possible paths to apples.\n\nIf the snake continues moving UP, next head is (3,1). Then, next move (epoch 10) direction could be adjusted. Let's think about the path.\n\nCurrent snake's body: (4,1) (head), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So the body is along column 1 from row 4 down to row 6, then row 6 column 2. So the snake is shaped like a vertical line down from (4,1) to (6,1), then right to (6,2).\n\nIf moving UP to (3,1), the new body positions would be (3,1) (head), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). Because when the snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. Since no apple was eaten, the tail (6,2) is removed. So the new body would be (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) (since length remains 4). Wait, original length is 4 (head + 3 body segments). When moving without eating, the snake moves forward, so the tail (last body segment) is removed. So original body segments are (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). The head is (4,1). When moving up to (3,1), the new head is (3,1). The body becomes (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). The tail (6,2) is dropped. So the new body positions are (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).\n\nSo after moving UP, the snake's body is (3,1) (H), (4,1) (S), (5,1) (S), (6,1) (S). The tail (6,2) is gone.\n\nNow, where are the apples? (1,2), (1,4), (2,4). The snake is moving upwards. Let's see if moving up can reach an apple. The next position after moving up is (3,1). Then, possible directions from there. The current direction would be UP (if we keep moving up). Next move (epoch 10) direction could be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since current direction is UP, can't go down).\n\nIf we go UP again, head moves to (2,1). Check (2,1) in row 2: \"#    A #\". So row 2, column 1 is a space. Then, (2,1) is safe. Then, next, moving up to (1,1) (row 1, column 1: which is a space in row 1: \"#  A A #\"). Then, (1,1) is space. Then, next move up to (0,1), which is a wall (row 0 is all #). So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,1), if we turn right (direction RIGHT), the head would move to (3,2). Then, (3,2) is a space. Then, maybe towards the apples in row 1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves RIGHT now (epoch 9 direction RIGHT), the head goes to (4,2). Then, the body becomes (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). The tail (6,2) is dropped. Then, in the next move (epoch 10), the current direction would be RIGHT. So possible directions: RIGHT, UP, DOWN (can't reverse to LEFT). Let's see.\n\nIf we move RIGHT again, head goes to (4,3). Then (4,3) is space. Then, next move to (4,4), which is space (row 4 is \"#H     #\", so columns 1 is H, 2-6 are spaces). (4,4) is space. Then, (4,5), (4,6) (row 4, column 6 is space, column 7 is wall). Then, moving towards row 2 and 1 where the apples are. For example, (4,4) could lead up to (3,4), (2,4) which is an apple (row 2, column 4 is A). So that's a possible path.\n\nLet's check (4,4) moving up. If the head is at (4,4), direction UP, then (3,4) is space (row 3: \"#      #\"), (2,4) is A (apple). So moving up from (3,4) to (2,4) would eat the apple. That's a good path.\n\nSo perhaps moving RIGHT now (epoch 9) would allow the snake to move towards the apple at (2,4). Let's see:\n\nCurrent head (4,1). Direction RIGHT: new head (4,2). Body becomes (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So the snake is now (4,2) H, (4,1) S, (5,1) S, (6,1) S.\n\nNext move (epoch 10), direction can be RIGHT (current direction would be RIGHT), UP, or DOWN (since can't reverse to LEFT). Let's choose RIGHT again. Head moves to (4,3). Then (4,3) is safe. Epoch 11, direction RIGHT again: (4,4). Epoch 12, direction UP: (3,4). Epoch 13, direction UP: (2,4) which is an apple. Then, eating that apple would increase the score and the snake grows by 1. That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if we move UP now (epoch 9), head (3,1). Then, next move (epoch 10) direction RIGHT: (3,2). Then, (3,3), (3,4). Then (3,4) is space (row 3, column 4). Then (2,4) is apple. So moving up from (3,4) to (2,4) would reach the apple. But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now allows the snake to reach (4,4) in a few steps, then up to (2,4) which is an apple. That's better.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apples in row 1, columns 2 and 4. Let's say (1,2) and (1,4). For (1,2), the snake would need to go up to row 1, column 2. Let's see:\n\nIf the snake goes UP from (4,1) to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). Then, (1,1) is space. Then, direction RIGHT to (1,2) which is an apple. That's another path. So (4,1) → (3,1) → (2,1) → (1,1) → (1,2). That's 4 moves. So if the snake moves UP now, then continues up, then right, it can reach (1,2) apple.\n\nWhich path is better? Let's check the current positions. The apple at (2,4) is in row 2, column 4. The apple at (1,2) is in row 1, column 2. The apple at (1,4) is row 1, column 4.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT now (epoch 9), head (4,2). Then, moving right to (4,3), (4,4). Then up to (3,4), (2,4) (apple). That's 4 steps (epoch 9: RIGHT → 4,2; epoch 10: RIGHT → 4,3; epoch 11: RIGHT →4,4; epoch 12: UP →3,4; epoch 13: UP →2,4). So that's 5 epochs (epoch 9 to 13) to reach that apple. But epoch 9 is current epoch 9, so 100-9=91 epochs left, so time is not an issue.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP now (epoch 9) to (3,1), then UP (epoch 10) to (2,1), UP (epoch 11) to (1,1), then RIGHT (epoch 12) to (1,2) (apple). That's 4 moves (epoch 9-12). So that's faster. So (1,2) is closer.\n\nSo which direction to choose now (epoch 9) to reach an apple quickly.\n\nIf we choose UP now, then next steps can reach (1,2) apple in 3 more moves (epoch 10,11,12). Let's confirm:\n\nEpoch 9: direction UP → head (3,1). Body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).\n\nEpoch 10: direction UP → head (2,1). Body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1).\n\nEpoch 11: direction UP → head (1,1). Body: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1).\n\nEpoch 12: direction RIGHT → head (1,2) (which is an apple). Then, eat the apple, score increases by 1, snake grows. So that's a valid path. And (1,2) is an apple. So moving UP now allows reaching that apple in 3 steps.\n\nIf we move RIGHT now, it's 4 steps to reach (2,4) apple. So UP is better.\n\nBut wait, need to check if the path is clear. Let's check the body positions after each move when moving UP.\n\nAfter epoch 9 (UP):\n\nHead (3,1). Body segments: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). No collision.\n\nEpoch 10 (UP): head (2,1). Body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). Safe.\n\nEpoch 11 (UP): head (1,1). Body: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). Safe.\n\nEpoch 12 (RIGHT): head (1,2). Which is an apple. So yes, that's safe. No collision.\n\nSo moving UP now is a good direction. Because it leads towards the apple at (1,2) in the next few steps. Also, moving UP is allowed (current direction is UP, so can continue in that direction; no reversal).\n\nWhat about possible collisions? Let's check if moving UP now causes any collision. The new head position is (3,1), which is empty. The body is (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So no collision with body. The walls are at the edges, so (3,1) is within the board (row 3 is between 0 and 7, column 1 between 0 and 7). So valid.\n\nSo the best direction here is UP. Because it's safe, continues the current direction (no reversal), and leads towards an apple.\n\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#SS    #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\n- **Snake Position**: Head `H` at (row 4, column 1). Body segments `S` follow at (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) (length 4).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,2), (1,4), (2,4).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Valid Moves**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is invalid due to reversal restriction).\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving left from (4,1) leads to (4,0), which is a wall (collision). Invalid.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (4,2) is safe but does not immediately target an apple. This path would require additional steps to reach apples.\n3. **UP**: Moving up to (3,1) is safe (empty cell). This direction aligns with the snake’s current movement and positions it to approach the nearest apple at (1,2) in subsequent moves:\n   - Epoch 9 (current): Move UP to (3,1) (safe, no collision).\n   - Epoch 10: Continue UP to (2,1) (safe).\n   - Epoch 11: Continue UP to (1,1) (safe).\n   - Epoch 12: Turn RIGHT to (1,2) (apple, score +1).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is safe, maintains the snake’s direction, and positions it to reach an apple efficiently.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#'. Let's parse the board row by row.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  A A # (so positions (1,2) and (1,4) are apples)\nRow 2: #    A # (position (2,4) is an apple)\nRow 3: #H     # (head 'H' is at (3,1))\nRow 4: #S     # (body 'S' at (4,1))\nRow 5: #S     # (body 'S' at (5,1))\nRow 6: #S     # (body 'S' at (6,1))\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. The snake's body is in a vertical line. Let's list the snake's body segments. The head is at (3,1). Then the body is at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So the snake's length is 4 (since starting length 1, each apple adds 1, so they've eaten 3 apples? Because 1 + 3 =4. The initial apples are 3, so maybe they ate all 3. But maybe not, need to check.\n\nWait, the current epoch is 10. The game ends at epoch 100, so we have 90 epochs left. The snake's current direction is UP. Let's think about the next move. Since the current direction is UP, the snake can't reverse direction (so can't go DOWN). So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe snake moves one square in the direction. Let's check where the head would go next based on each possible direction.\n\nCurrent head position is (3,1). Let's note coordinates as (row, column), with row 0 at top.\n\nIf direction is UP (current direction), the next head position would be (2,1). Let's check that square. Row 2 is \"#    A #\", so (2,1) is a space (since row 2, column 1: the string is \"#    A #\", which is index 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: '#'. So (2,1) is ' ', which is empty. So moving UP, the head goes to (2,1). Then, the body segments move. The current body is (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). When the snake moves, the head moves forward, and each body part follows the previous one. So after moving UP, the new body positions would be (3,1) (old head), (4,1), (5,1), and the new head is (2,1). So the new board would have H at (2,1), S at (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). The tail (6,1) would be removed, unless the snake ate an apple (which increases length, so tail remains). But in this case, (2,1) is empty, not an apple. So the snake doesn't eat an apple. So the tail (6,1) would become empty, so the body is now (2,1) H, then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) as S. So the new snake length remains 4.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: moving left from (3,1) would take the head to (3,0). But (3,0) is a wall ('#'), so that's a collision. The game ends. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: moving right from (3,1) would take the head to (3,2). Let's check row 3: \"#H     #\", which is index 0: '#', 1: 'H', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: '#'. So (3,2) is ' ', empty. So moving RIGHT, the head is at (3,2). The body follows: old head (3,1) becomes S, then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) becomes S. The tail (6,1) would be removed, but since no apple is eaten, the length stays 4. So new positions: H at (3,2), S at (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). The old tail (6,1) becomes empty.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: but current direction is UP, and reversing direction (UP to DOWN) is not allowed. So DOWN is invalid. So the possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. But LEFT is a wall, so invalid. So only UP and RIGHT are possible.\n\nWait, let's confirm the direction reversal rule. The snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. Similarly, if current is LEFT, can't go RIGHT. So current direction is UP, possible next directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse). So LEFT and RIGHT are allowed as long as they don't cause collision.\n\nBut moving LEFT would take head to (3,0), which is a wall (since row 3 starts with '#', column 0 is '#'). So that's a collision, game over. So LEFT is invalid. So options are UP or RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's check the apples. The current apples are at (1,2), (1,4), (2,4). Let's see where those are. So (1,2) is row 1, column 2: in row 1, \"#  A A #\", so positions 2 and 4 are A. So (1,2) and (1,4) are apples. Row 2 is \"#    A #\", so (2,4) is A.\n\nIf we move UP, the head goes to (2,1). What's around (2,1)? The square (2,4) is an apple. The next move after that, if we continue UP, maybe. Let's see. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now would take head to (3,2). Let's check (3,2) is empty. Then, next possible moves.\n\nThe snake's body is currently in (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So the snake is a vertical line going down from (3,1) (head) to (6,1) (tail). So the snake is facing UP, moving up. So the body is behind it.\n\nIf we move UP to (2,1), the next position. Then, the snake's body is (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). The tail (6,1) is now empty. Then, the next move, if we go UP again, head would be (1,1). Let's check (1,1): row 1 is \"#  A A #\", so (1,1) is ' ', empty. Then, the body would be (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). Tail (5,1) becomes empty. Then, perhaps we can reach the apples in row 1.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,2). Then, the snake's body is (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). Tail (6,1) empty. Then, next possible directions. The snake is now at (3,2), direction could be UP, LEFT (but LEFT would take back to (3,1), which is body), RIGHT (to (3,3)), or UP (to (2,2)).\n\nBut moving RIGHT now might allow the snake to reach the apples in row 1 (A at (1,2)) or row 2 (A at (2,4)). Let's see. Let's check if moving UP now is better.\n\nIf current move is UP, head goes to (2,1). Let's check (2,1) is safe. No collision with body. The body is (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So (2,1) is not part of the body. So that's safe. So moving UP is safe.\n\nIf current move is RIGHT, head goes to (3,2). The body is (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So (3,2) is not part of the body. So that's safe.\n\nSo both directions are safe. Which one is better to reach apples?\n\nThe apples are at (1,2), (1,4), (2,4). Let's see the positions.\n\nIf we move UP to (2,1), the next possible moves. Let's think of the next steps.\n\nAfter moving UP to (2,1), the direction could be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since current direction is UP, next direction can't be DOWN). Let's see.\n\nFrom (2,1), if we go UP again, head would be (1,1). (1,1) is ' ' (row 1 is \"#  A A #\", so (1,1) is ' '). Then, moving UP again (to (0,1)) is a wall (row 0 is all #), so that's a collision. So can't go up from (1,1).\n\nAlternatively, from (2,1), moving RIGHT to (2,2). (2,2) is ' ' (row 2 is \"#    A #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: '#'). So (2,2) is ' '. Then, moving RIGHT again to (2,3), then (2,4) which is an apple. So if the snake moves UP, then RIGHT, then RIGHT, then RIGHT, it can reach (2,4) which is an apple. That's 3 moves.\n\nAlternatively, if the current move is RIGHT to (3,2), then next possible directions. From (3,2), direction could be UP (to (2,2)), RIGHT (to (3,3)), or LEFT (to (3,1), which is body, so collision). So LEFT is invalid. So possible directions are UP or RIGHT.\n\nIf direction is UP from (3,2), head moves to (2,2). Then, next move could be RIGHT to (2,3), then RIGHT to (2,4) (apple). So that's 3 moves (current move RIGHT, next UP, next RIGHT, next RIGHT). So that's 3 moves to reach (2,4) as well.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,2), moving RIGHT to (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), but row 3 is \"#H     #\", so (3,4) is ' ', (3,5) is ' ', (3,6) is '#', so can't go right beyond (3,5).\n\nBut the apples at (1,2) and (1,4) are in row 1. Let's see. If we move UP to (2,1), then UP to (1,1), then RIGHT to (1,2), which is an apple. That's 3 moves: current move UP (to (2,1)), next move UP (to (1,1)), next move RIGHT (to (1,2)). That's 3 steps, and (1,2) is an apple. So that's a good path.\n\nSo moving UP now allows the snake to reach (1,2) apple in 3 steps, whereas moving RIGHT might take a bit longer.\n\nAnother thing to check: the snake's body. The current body is (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). If the snake moves UP, the body becomes (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So the tail (6,1) is now empty. So the snake's body is shorter, but that's okay. The key is to avoid collision with itself.\n\nSo moving UP is safe. Moving RIGHT is also safe. Which direction is better?\n\nThe current direction is UP, so if we keep moving UP, the snake is moving towards row 1, which has apples. So moving UP now is the best option. Because moving UP allows the snake to approach the apples in row 1 and row 2.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now would take the snake to (3,2), which is a safe position but maybe not as directly towards the apples.\n\nSo the best direction to choose is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A A #\n#    A #\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at (3,1). The body 'S' segments are at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), forming a vertical line downward.\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,2), (1,4), and (2,4).\n- **Collision Rules**: The snake loses if it hits walls (boundary '#') or itself.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving left from (3,1) leads to (3,0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes an immediate collision and game over. **Invalid**.\n2. **DOWN**: Reversing direction from UP to DOWN is not allowed. **Invalid**.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving right from (3,1) leads to (3,2), an empty space (' '). This is safe but does not directly approach the nearest apples.\n4. **UP**: Moving up from (3,1) leads to (2,1), an empty space (' '). This is safe and moves the snake closer to apples in row 1 and row 2.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving UP keeps the snake on a path toward the apples in row 1 (e.g., (1,2)) and row 2 (e.g., (2,4)). This direction avoids collisions and positions the snake to reach apples efficiently.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls as '#'. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  A A # (so positions (1,2) and (1,4) are apples)\nRow 2: #H   A # (head 'H' is at (2,1), and there's an apple at (2,4))\nRow 3: #S     # (body 'S' at (3,1))\nRow 4: #S     # (body 'S' at (4,1))\nRow 5: #S     # (body 'S' at (5,1))\nRow 6: #      # (empty)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the epoch is 11 (so 89 more steps before the game ends). The snake's movement is such that each step, it moves in the current direction, unless the player changes direction (without reversing). Since the current direction is UP, the snake's next move would be to move up unless the direction is changed. But the snake can't reverse direction, so if current is UP, the possible directions to change to are LEFT or RIGHT (can't go DOWN, which is reverse).\n\nFirst, let's track the snake's body. The head is at (2,1). The body segments are at (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So the snake's body is a vertical line going down from the head. The length of the snake is 4 (head + 3 body segments). \n\nNow, the snake is moving UP. Let's see where the head would go if it continues UP. The current head is at (2,1). Moving UP would take it to (1,1). Let's check that position. The row 1, column 1 is a space (from row 1: #  A A #, which is positions 0: #, 1: space, 2: A, 3: space, 4: A, 5: space, 6: #). So (1,1) is empty. No collision with walls (since row 1 is within 0-7, column 1 is within 0-7, walls are at 0 and 7 columns). No collision with body because the body is at (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So moving UP would take the head to (1,1), which is safe. But is there an apple there? (1,1) is a space, so no apple. So the snake would move, and the body would follow. The new body positions would be (2,1) (old head), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). The tail (5,1) would stay if the snake doesn't eat an apple. Wait, but the snake's length is 4. When moving, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward. So the tail (5,1) would be removed, and the new positions would be head at (1,1), body at (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). So the snake remains length 4.\n\nAlternatively, what if we change direction to LEFT or RIGHT? Let's check possible directions. The current direction is UP, so the snake can't go DOWN. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: the head would move left from (2,1) to (2,0). But (2,0) is a wall (since column 0 is all '#'). So moving LEFT would cause a wall collision, game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: the head moves right from (2,1) to (2,2). Let's check (2,2). The row 2 is \"#H   A #\", so positions: 0: #, 1:H, 2: space, 3: space, 4:A, 5: space, 6: #. So (2,2) is a space. No collision with body (body is at (3,1), etc). So moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,2). No apple there. Then the body would shift: new body positions would be (2,1) (old head), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). Tail (5,1) is removed. So safe.\n\nBut what's the goal? To eat apples. Let's check where the apples are. The apples are at (1,2), (1,4), (2,4). Let's see. The head is at (2,1). The current direction is UP. If moving UP, next head position is (1,1). From there, what's around? (1,2) is an apple. So if after moving UP, the next step could be to move RIGHT to (1,2) and eat the apple. But we need to think about the next move. But since we can only choose the next direction, let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT now would get closer to an apple. The head at (2,1) moving RIGHT to (2,2). Then, the next positions. Let's see, the apple at (2,4) is two steps to the right. If the snake moves RIGHT again (assuming direction is RIGHT now), next step would be (2,3), then (2,4) which is an apple. So that's a possible path.\n\nBut let's check the current possible moves. The snake's current direction is UP. If we choose to go UP, the next position is (1,1). Let's check if that's safe. Yes. Then, in the next step, the direction could be RIGHT (since current direction would be UP, but after moving UP, the direction can be changed to RIGHT). Then from (1,1), moving RIGHT to (1,2) which is an apple. That would be good. So if we go UP now, then next step RIGHT, we can eat the apple at (1,2).\n\nAlternatively, if we go RIGHT now (direction RIGHT), the head moves to (2,2). Then, the direction could be RIGHT again (since current direction is RIGHT), next step to (2,3), then (2,4) (apple). That's also possible. Let's see which is better.\n\nBut let's check if there are any immediate dangers. For example, if the snake moves UP, (1,1) is safe. If it moves RIGHT, (2,2) is safe. Moving LEFT is into a wall (game over). Moving DOWN is reverse direction (not allowed). So possible directions are UP, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which direction leads to an apple sooner? Let's check the positions of apples.\n\nCurrent apples:\n\n- (1,2) (row 1, column 2)\n- (1,4) (row 1, column 4)\n- (2,4) (row 2, column 4)\n\nHead is at (2,1). Let's calculate the distance to each apple.\n\nDistance to (1,2): moving UP then RIGHT (2 steps).\n\nDistance to (2,4): moving RIGHT three times (current position (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4)).\n\nDistance to (1,4): moving UP to (1,1), then RIGHT three times (1,1 → 1,2 → 1,3 → 1,4). That's 4 steps.\n\nSo the closest apple is (1,2) (2 steps away if we go UP then RIGHT) and (2,4) (3 steps if we go RIGHT each time).\n\nIf we choose UP now, then next direction can be RIGHT. Let's see if after moving UP, the direction can be changed to RIGHT. Because the current direction after moving UP would be UP (since the direction input is what we choose now). Wait, the direction input is the direction the snake will move in the next step. So when the player gives a direction, that becomes the new direction (as long as it's not reversing). So if current direction is UP, and we input RIGHT, the new direction is RIGHT (since RIGHT is not the reverse of UP). Then the snake moves in the RIGHT direction.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\"\n\nAh, the snake's direction is changed to the input direction, provided it's not a reverse. So if current direction is UP, possible new directions are UP (continue), LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse). So if we input RIGHT, the direction becomes RIGHT, and the snake moves RIGHT in the next step.\n\nSo the movement is: the direction input determines the direction the snake will move in the next step, as long as it's not a reverse. So, in the current state, the snake is moving UP. The next movement direction is the input we choose (must be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT).\n\nSo, if we input UP: the snake moves UP (from (2,1) to (1,1)), direction remains UP.\n\nIf we input RIGHT: the snake moves RIGHT (from (2,1) to (2,2)), direction becomes RIGHT.\n\nIf we input LEFT: the snake moves LEFT (from (2,1) to (2,0)), which is a wall. Collision, game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo the possible choices are UP or RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's see the next positions.\n\nCase 1: Input UP. Next head position (1,1). Check for collision: (1,1) is empty. Body positions after moving: the body segments shift. The old head (2,1) becomes part of the body. The body was (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So new body positions would be (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). The tail (5,1) is removed (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so length remains 4). So the new body is (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), and head at (1,1). Now, the next direction could be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since current direction is UP). If next step, we choose RIGHT, then the head moves to (1,2), which is an apple. Eating that apple would increase the score, and the snake grows. So (1,2) is an apple, so that's a good move.\n\nCase 2: Input RIGHT. Next head position (2,2). Check collision: (2,2) is empty. Body positions become (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). The tail (5,1) is removed. Then, the direction is now RIGHT. Next possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN (since current direction is RIGHT; reverse is LEFT, so can't go LEFT). So next step, moving RIGHT again to (2,3). Then, next step RIGHT to (2,4), which is an apple. That's three steps to reach (2,4).\n\nComparing the two options: moving UP allows reaching an apple in two steps (current step UP, next step RIGHT to (1,2)), while moving RIGHT allows reaching (2,4) in three steps. So moving UP is better because it leads to an apple sooner.\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any possible collisions if we move UP. The new head is at (1,1). The body is at (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). So (1,1) is not overlapping with any body part, so safe.\n\nWhat about if after moving UP, the next direction is RIGHT. The head would be at (1,2), which is an apple. So that's a valid move. So the plan is: move UP now, then RIGHT next step to eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we move RIGHT now, then next steps:\n\nStep 1 (current epoch 11): direction RIGHT → head (2,2).\n\nStep 12: direction RIGHT → head (2,3).\n\nStep 13: direction RIGHT → head (2,4) (apple). Eat it, score increases. Then the snake grows. So that's also possible.\n\nBut which is better? Both paths are safe, but (1,2) is closer. So moving UP now allows us to reach an apple in the next step (epoch 12) if we choose RIGHT then.\n\nSo the best direction now is UP, because moving UP is safe and allows reaching an apple in the next step. Alternatively, moving RIGHT is safe but takes longer to reach an apple.\n\nWait, but the question is, what direction should we choose now (epoch 11). The answer is the direction input for the next movement. So the current direction is UP, and we can choose UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. LEFT is invalid (wall). So options are UP or RIGHT.\n\nIf we choose UP, the head moves to (1,1). Then, in epoch 12, the direction could be RIGHT (since current direction would be UP again, unless we change it). So (1,1) → (1,2) (apple) in epoch 12. That's good.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT, head moves to (2,2). Then, in epoch 12, direction could be RIGHT again, moving to (2,3). Epoch 13: RIGHT to (2,4) (apple). So two more steps.\n\nSo choosing UP now is better because it leads to an apple in the next step. Therefore, the best direction is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A A #\n#H   A #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,1) (row 2, column 1), with body segments at (3,1), (4,1), and (5,1). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. The apples are located at (1,2), (1,4), and (2,4). \n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (2,1) would take the head to (2,0), which is a wall. This causes an immediate collision and game over. **Invalid**.\n- **DOWN**: Reversing direction from UP to DOWN is not allowed. **Invalid**.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (2,1) takes the head to (2,2), which is empty and safe. However, the nearest apple in this direction is (2,4), requiring 3 steps (RIGHT → RIGHT → RIGHT).\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (2,1) takes the head to (1,1), which is empty and safe. From (1,1), the next move can be RIGHT to reach (1,2) (an apple) in the following step. This path reaches an apple faster (2 steps total: UP → RIGHT).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is safe and allows the snake to reach an apple (at (1,2)) in the next step, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#H A A #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the current epoch is 12. The snake's head is 'H', and the body segments are 'S'. The snake is moving UP, so normally, if we don't change direction, it will continue moving UP. But we need to check if that's safe and if there's an apple there.\n\nFirst, let's find the position of the head. Looking at the first row (after the top wall), which is row 1 (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top to bottom). The first row is \"#H A A #\". So the head 'H' is at position (1,1) (row 1, column 1). The current direction is UP, which would mean moving to row 0, column 1. But row 0 is the top wall, which is all '#'s. So if the snake moves UP, the head would hit the wall, causing a collision and the game ends. Oh right, the walls are around the edges, so row 0 and row 7 (since it's 8x8) are walls, and columns 0 and 7 are walls. So the valid positions are rows 1-6 and columns 1-6.\n\nSo moving UP from (1,1) would take the head to (0,1), which is a wall. That's a collision. So we can't keep moving UP. The snake can't reverse direction, so the current direction is UP. The possible directions we can turn to are LEFT or RIGHT, because reversing (DOWN) is not allowed. Because the snake can't reverse direction. So if current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP (but UP is into a wall here).\n\nWait, the rules say the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. Similarly, if current is LEFT, next can't be RIGHT, etc. So from UP, possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (but moving UP here is invalid). So we need to check LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nLet's check the head position again. Current head is at (1,1). Let's confirm the coordinates. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7)\nRow 1: #H A A # → columns 0 is #, 1 is H, 2 is space, 3 is A, 4 is A, 5 is space, 6 is #. So H is at (1,1).\n\nCurrent direction is UP. So the next position if moving UP would be (0,1), which is a wall (row 0). So that's invalid. So we can't choose UP. So we need to choose between LEFT or RIGHT. Let's check those directions.\n\nFirst, possible directions: LEFT (from current direction UP, allowed), RIGHT (allowed), DOWN (reverse, not allowed). So options are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check moving LEFT. The head is at (1,1). Moving LEFT would take it to (1,0). But column 0 is a wall (since row 1's first character is #, which is column 0). So (1,0) is a wall. So moving LEFT would hit the wall. That's a collision. So that's bad.\n\nNow check moving RIGHT. The head is at (1,1). Moving RIGHT would take it to (1,2). Let's check row 1, column 2. The row 1 is \"#H A A #\", so column 2 is a space (since positions are 0: #, 1:H, 2: space, 3:A, 4:A, 5: space, 6: #). So (1,2) is empty (a space). Now, we need to check if that position is part of the snake's body. Let's look at the body segments.\n\nThe body is represented by 'S's. Let's list all the 'S's:\n\nRow 2: #S   A # → column 1 is S (row 2, column 1)\nRow 3: #S     # → column 1 is S (row 3, column 1)\nRow 4: #S     # → column 1 is S (row 4, column 1)\nSo the body is at (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). The head is at (1,1). So the snake's body is a vertical line along column 1, from row 1 (head) down to row 4 (the last S). The length of the snake is 4 (head + 3 S's). So when the snake moves, the body follows. The movement is such that each body part moves to the position of the previous part. So if the head moves to (1,2), then the next positions of the body would be (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). The previous tail (row 4, column 1) would disappear unless the snake ate an apple.\n\nWait, but when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (last S) is removed. So the snake's length remains the same. If it eats an apple, the tail isn't removed, so the length increases.\n\nSo in the current scenario, if the snake moves RIGHT to (1,2), which is a space, not a wall, not a body part. Let's confirm (1,2) is not a body part. The body is at (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). So (1,2) is safe. So moving RIGHT would be safe.\n\nIs there an apple in (1,2)? Let's check. The current cell (1,2) is a space (from row 1: \"#H A A #\"). So moving RIGHT to (1,2) doesn't eat an apple. But that's okay, as long as it's safe.\n\nWhat about the other direction, DOWN? Wait, current direction is UP. Can we turn to DOWN? The rules say the snake cannot reverse direction. So current direction is UP, so next direction can't be DOWN. So DOWN is invalid. So we can't choose DOWN.\n\nSo the only possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. UP leads to wall, LEFT leads to wall, RIGHT leads to safe space. So the only safe direction is RIGHT.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let's recheck the positions.\n\nHead is at (1,1). Directions:\n\n- UP: (0,1) → wall (invalid)\n- DOWN: (2,1) → (2,1) is S (body). So if we move DOWN, the head would go to (2,1), which is part of the body. That's a collision. Oh wait, if the current direction is UP, can we turn to DOWN? No, because reversing direction is not allowed. So even if moving DOWN would hit the body, but we can't choose it anyway. Because the direction can't be reversed.\n\nSo possible directions (allowed) are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (but UP is invalid). So between LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nLEFT direction: moving to (1,0) → column 0 is wall (row 1, column 0 is #) → collision. So invalid.\n\nRIGHT direction: moving to (1,2) → which is (row 1, column 2). Let's check the current cell (1,2) in the board. The row 1 is \"#H A A #\", which is:\n\ncolumns 0: # \n\ncolumn 1: H \n\ncolumn 2:  (space)\n\ncolumn 3: A \n\ncolumn 4: A \n\ncolumn 5:  (space)\n\ncolumn 6: # \n\nSo (1,2) is a space. So moving there is safe. The body is at (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). So (1,2) is not part of the body. So that's safe.\n\nSo the correct direction to choose is RIGHT. Because that's the only direction that doesn't cause a collision. If we choose UP, we hit the wall. LEFT hits the wall. DOWN is not allowed (reverse direction) and even if allowed, (2,1) is S (body), so collision. So RIGHT is the only safe move.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#H A A #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1,1) (row 1, column 1). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). \n\n- **Moving UP**: The head would move to (0,1), which is a wall (row 0 is a wall). This causes a collision and ends the game.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (1,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall). This also causes a collision.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (1,2), which is an empty space (not a wall or part of the snake's body). This is safe.  \n\nThus, the only valid direction to avoid collision is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's state.\n\nThe game board is given as:\n\n########\n#SHA A #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSo, the board is 8x8. Let's break down each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #SHA A # → Let's index the columns from 0 to 7. So columns 1 to 6 are the play area. Let's list each cell in row 1:\n- Column 1: # (wall)\n- Column 2: S (snake body)\n- Column 3: H (snake head)\n- Column 4: A (apple)\n- Column 5:  (space)\n- Column 6: A (apple)\n- Column 7: # (wall)\nSo row 1, columns 2 is S, 3 is H, 4 is A, 6 is A.\n\nRow 2: #S   A # → Columns 1 is #, 2 is S, 3 is space, 4 is space, 5 is A, 6 is space, 7 is #.\n\nRow 3: #S     # → Column 2 is S, others (3-6) are spaces.\n\nRow 4: #      # → All spaces between columns 1-6.\n\nRows 5 and 6 are similar, all spaces.\n\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nNow, the snake's head is at (1,3) (assuming rows are 0-based from top, columns 0-based from left). The current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is moving to the right (column increases by 1 each step).\n\nThe snake's body is made up of 'S' cells. Let's track the snake's body segments. The head is H at (1,3). The body S cells are:\n\nLooking at row 1, column 2: S (so (1,2) is body).\n\nRow 2, column 2: S (so (2,2) is body).\n\nRow 3, column 2: S (so (3,2) is body).\n\nSo the snake's body is a vertical line going down from (1,2) to (3,2). The head is at (1,3), moving right.\n\nThe snake's length is the number of S and H cells. H is 1, S cells are 3 (rows 1,2,3 column 2). So current length is 4.\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, so the next movement would be to (1,4) if the direction remains RIGHT. Let's check what's at (1,4): according to row 1, column 4 is A (apple). So if the snake moves RIGHT, the head would go to (1,4), which is an apple. Eating that apple would increase the score by 1, and the snake would grow. When the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't shrink, so the body length increases by 1. So after moving RIGHT, the head is at (1,4), and the body would now include the previous positions. The previous head was at (1,3), which becomes S. The body segments would shift: (1,2) remains S, (2,2) remains S, (3,2) remains S, and the new head is (1,4). Wait, no. Let's think about how the snake moves normally. Normally, when moving, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So for a snake moving in direction D, each step: new head position is current head + direction. Then, each body part moves to the position of the previous body part. So the tail (last body segment) moves forward, and if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail is removed. But if it eats an apple, the tail is not removed, so the snake grows by 1.\n\nCurrent snake's body positions (from head to tail):\n\nHead: (1,3) → direction RIGHT.\n\nBody segments: (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2). So the order is head at (1,3), followed by (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). So when moving RIGHT, the new head is (1,4). Then, the body segments shift: (1,3) becomes the next segment (since the head was there before), (1,2) moves to where the next segment was, etc. But if the snake eats an apple (which is at (1,4)), then the tail (3,2) is not removed. So the new body would be:\n\nHead: (1,4)\n\nBody segments: (1,3) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2). So the length increases by 1 (from 4 to 5).\n\nNow, possible directions the player can choose are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. But the snake cannot reverse direction. Current direction is RIGHT. Reversing direction would be LEFT (since RIGHT's opposite is LEFT). So the player cannot choose LEFT. So possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. RIGHT: As discussed, next head position is (1,4), which is an apple. Eating it is good. No collision (since (1,4) is not a wall, and not a body part. The current body parts are (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). So (1,4) is safe. So moving RIGHT is safe and gains a point.\n\n2. UP: Current direction is RIGHT. Can the snake turn UP? Yes, because UP is not the reverse (reverse is LEFT). So direction UP is allowed. The new head position would be (0,3). But row 0 is the top wall (all #). So (0,3) is a wall. Collision, game over. So UP is invalid.\n\n3. DOWN: Direction DOWN is allowed (not reverse of RIGHT). The new head position would be (2,3). Let's check (2,3). Looking at row 2, column 3 is a space (since row 2 is #S   A # → columns 2 is S, 3 is space, 4 is space, 5 is A). So (2,3) is empty. No collision. So moving DOWN would take the head to (2,3). Then, the body would shift. The previous head (1,3) becomes S, (1,2) becomes S, (2,2) becomes S, (3,2) becomes S. The tail would move, but since no apple was eaten, the tail (3,2) would be removed? Wait, no. Wait, the snake moves, and if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail is removed. So normally, when moving, the snake's length remains the same. So for example, if the snake is length 4 (H + 3 S), moving without eating an apple, the new positions are: head at new position, followed by previous head, then previous body segments, and the tail (last S) is removed. So in the current state, the body is H at (1,3), followed by S at (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). If direction is DOWN, new head is (2,3). Then the body segments become (1,3) (old head), (1,2), (2,2). The tail (3,2) is removed. So the new body would be H at (2,3), S at (1,3), (1,2), (2,2). No collision here, as (2,3) is empty. But there's no apple there, so no score gain.\n\nSo moving DOWN is safe but doesn't get an apple. Moving RIGHT gets an apple (good) and is safe.\n\nWhat about other possibilities? Let's confirm. Are there any other apples? The current apples are at (1,4), (1,6), (2,5). Let's check:\n\nRow 1: #SHA A # → columns 4 and 6 are A. So (1,4) and (1,6).\n\nRow 2: #S   A # → column 5 is A. So (2,5).\n\nSo three apples, which matches the initial condition (starts with 3 apples). So if the snake moves RIGHT, it's going to (1,4) which is an apple. That's the closest apple.\n\nSo the best direction is RIGHT, as it allows the snake to eat an apple, increase the score, and continue without collision. Other directions either lead to collision (UP) or no apple (DOWN). So the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#SHA A #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1, 3) (row 1, column 3), moving in the RIGHT direction. The snake's body (S) segments are at (1, 2), (2, 2), and (3, 2). The apples (A) are at (1, 4), (1, 6), and (2, 5). \n\nThe snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT is the reverse of RIGHT and is invalid). Possible directions are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN:\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0, 3), which is a wall (row 0 is the top boundary). This causes a collision, ending the game.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (2, 3), a safe empty space. However, no apple is present here, so the snake does not grow, and the score remains unchanged.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (1, 4), which contains an apple. Eating this apple increases the score by 1, the snake grows in length, and no collision occurs (the new head position is not a wall or body segment).\n\nThe optimal choice is to move RIGHT to eat the apple and safely grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#SSHAA #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the epoch is 14. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S's. Let's locate the head first. Looking at the second row (since the first is all #), the second row is \"#SSHAA #\". So positions are (row 1, column 1) is #, (1,2) is S, (1,3) is S, (1,4) is H, (1,5) is A, (1,6) is A, (1,7) is #. So the head 'H' is at (row 1, column 4) (assuming rows start at 0, maybe? Wait, usually grids are 0-based. Let's clarify:\n\nRows are 0 to 7 (since 8x8). Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7)\nRow 1: #SSHAA # → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3:H, 4:A, 5:A, 6: (space), 7:#? Wait, the row is written as \"#SSHAA #\", which is 8 characters. Let's check:\n\nRow 1: characters are [0]# [1]S [2]S [3]H [4]A [5]A [6] (space) [7]# → yes, 8 characters. So H is at (1,3).\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So the snake is moving right. Let's track the snake's body. The body is S's. Let's see the snake's path. The head is H at (1,3). The body segments are S's connected. Let's check adjacent S's. To the left of H (since direction was RIGHT, previous position would be to the left). So (1,3) is H. The previous position (before moving right) would be (1,2), which is S. Then (1,1) is S. Then, looking at row 2: row 2 is \"#S   A #\". So row 2, column 1 is S. So (2,1) is S. Then row 3: \"#S     #\", so (3,1) is S. So the snake's body is:\n\nHead at (1,3) → direction RIGHT. The body segments are:\n\n- (1,2) S (next to head, since moving right, this was the head's previous position)\n- (1,1) S (previous to (1,2))\n- (2,1) S (previous to (1,1) → so direction from (2,1) to (1,1) is UP)\n- (3,1) S (previous to (2,1) → direction from (3,1) to (2,1) is UP)\n  \nSo the snake's body is a vertical line from (3,1) up to (1,1), then right to (1,2), then right to (1,3) (head). So the snake's length is 4 (H + 3 S's). \n\nNow, the snake is moving RIGHT. The next position the head will move to is (1,4) (since current head is (1,3), moving right → column 4). Let's check what's at (1,4): it's A (apple). So if the snake continues moving RIGHT, it will eat the apple. That's good because it increases the score. Also, when the snake eats an apple, it grows in length. So the new head will be at (1,4), and the body will extend. The current body is (1,3) H → (1,2) S → (1,1) S → (2,1) S → (3,1) S. After moving right, the new head is (1,4). Since it's eating an apple, the snake doesn't lose the last body segment. So the new body would be:\n\nH at (1,4), then (1,3) becomes S (since it was the previous head), then (1,2) S, (1,1) S, (2,1) S, (3,1) S. So the snake's length increases by 1.\n\nBut wait, the player can choose the direction. The current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible directions are LEFT (reverse, which is not allowed), UP, or DOWN. Because current direction is RIGHT, the next direction can't be LEFT (since that's reversing). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n\nIf the player chooses RIGHT (current direction), then head moves to (1,4), which is an apple. That's good. So the snake eats the apple, grows, and the score increases.\n\nWhat if the player chooses UP? The head is at (1,3). Moving UP would take it to (0,3), which is a wall (row 0 is all #). So that's a collision, game over. So UP is invalid.\n\nIf the player chooses DOWN: the head is at (1,3). Moving DOWN would take it to (2,3). Let's check row 2: \"#S   A #\". So row 2, column 3 is a space (since the row is \"#S   A #\", columns 0: #, 1:S, 2: (space), 3: (space), 4: (space), 5:A, 6: (space), 7:#). So (2,3) is empty. So moving DOWN would take the head there. But then, the next position would be (2,3), which is safe. But there's no apple there, so the snake doesn't eat anything, and the body would move (since the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail would move forward, so the last segment (3,1) would be removed, and the rest follow). But why not take the apple in the current direction?\n\nSo the best choice is to continue moving RIGHT, which leads to eating the apple. Because moving RIGHT is allowed (current direction, not reversing), and (1,4) is an apple. So the direction should be RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#SSHAA #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at row 1, column 3 (0-indexed). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). \n\n- Moving UP would take the head to row 0, column 3, which is a wall (#), causing an immediate collision and game over.  \n- Moving DOWN would take the head to row 2, column 3, which is an empty space (no apple), resulting in no score gain and normal movement (losing the tail segment).  \n- Continuing RIGHT (current direction) moves the head to row 1, column 4, which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and allows the snake to grow in length without losing its tail segment.  \n\nThus, the optimal direction is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, let's look at the current game board and the current direction. The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake can't reverse direction, so it can't go LEFT. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the game board. The board is 8x8, surrounded by walls. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #SSSHA # (so positions 1-5: S, S, S, H, A, space, then #)\nRow 2: #S   A # (positions 1: S, then spaces, position 5: A)\nRow 3: #S     # (position 1: S)\nRow 4: #    A # (position 5: A)\nRow 5: #      # (all spaces)\nRow 6: #      # (all spaces)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is in row 1, column 4 (assuming columns are 0-based from left). Let's confirm the positions:\n\nRow 1 (index 1) is \"#SSSHA #\", so columns 0 is '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'H', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So H is at (1,4). The current direction is RIGHT, so the next move would be to (1,5) if we go RIGHT. Let's check what's in (1,5): it's 'A' (apple). So if we go RIGHT, the head moves to (1,5), which is an apple. Then the snake will eat the apple, grow in length. The body would follow. But wait, when the snake moves, normally the body follows: the head moves, then each body part moves to the previous position of the part in front. But when it eats an apple, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move (since length increases by 1). So after eating, the body would be the previous positions, with the new head at the apple's position.\n\nBut before that, need to check for collisions. Let's see possible directions:\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. Possible directions: can't go LEFT (reverse). So options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each direction:\n\n1. RIGHT: next head position is (1,5). What's there? 'A' (apple). So eating it. Now, check if that position is a wall or body. (1,5) is within the board (rows 0-7, columns 0-7; row 1 is valid, column 5 is valid, not a wall). The current body parts are the 'S's. Let's list the snake's body positions. The head is at (1,4). The body 'S's are in row 1, columns 1,2,3 (since row 1 is #SSSHA # → columns 1:S, 2:S, 3:S). Also, row 2, column 1: 'S', row 3, column 1: 'S'. So the body positions are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1). The next head position (1,5) is not any of these, so no collision. So moving RIGHT is safe, and we get the apple. That's good.\n\n2. UP: direction is UP. Current head is (1,4). Moving UP would take it to (0,4). But row 0 is all '#', so that's a wall. Collision, game over. So UP is invalid.\n\n3. DOWN: direction is DOWN. Head moves from (1,4) to (2,4). Let's check (2,4). The row 2 is \"#S   A #\", so columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (2,4) is a space. Now, check if that position is part of the snake's body. The body positions are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1). (2,4) is not among them. So moving DOWN is safe. But there's no apple there. So the snake would move, the body would shift. The tail (which is the last 'S') would move. Let's see: the current snake's body is a chain. The head is (1,4). The next part (neck) would be (1,3), then (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1). So when moving DOWN to (2,4), the new head is (2,4). The body parts would be (1,4) → becomes 'S', (1,3) → 'S', (1,2) → 'S', (1,1) → 'S', (2,1) → 'S', and the tail (3,1) would move? Wait, when the snake moves without eating, the tail is removed (since length remains same). So original length is head (1) + body (let's count the 'S's). Let's count the 'S's in the board:\n\nRow 1: 3 S's (columns 1,2,3)\nRow 2: 1 S (column 1)\nRow 3: 1 S (column 1)\nTotal S's: 3+1+1=5. So snake length is 1 (head) +5 (body) =6. So when moving, the snake moves head to new position, each body part follows the previous position. So the tail (last S) would be removed. So the current tail is (3,1). After moving, if no apple is eaten, the new tail would be (2,1) (since (3,1) is removed). \n\nBut moving DOWN to (2,4) is safe, but no apple. So score doesn't increase.\n\nSo the options are: RIGHT (safe, eat apple), UP (wall collision, game over), DOWN (safe, no apple).\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT. Because it's safe, and gets an apple, increasing the score. So the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\n########\n#SSSHA #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state, snake position, and possible moves:\n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Head (H) Position**: Row 1, Column 4 (0-based).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT (snake cannot reverse to LEFT).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n- **Apples (A)**: Located at (1,5), (2,5), (4,5).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0,4), which is a wall (`#`). This causes an immediate collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (2,4), a blank space. No collision (body parts are at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1)), but no apple is present here. The snake moves safely but gains no score. **Safe but no apple**.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (1,5), which contains an apple (`A`). No collision (body parts do not occupy (1,5)), so the snake eats the apple, grows, and increases the score by 1. **Safe and gains score**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is the best choice as it safely allows the snake to eat an apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls (##) around the edges. Let's list out each row to visualize the snake's position, the apples, and other elements.\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #SSSSH # (so positions 1,1 is S; 1,2 S; 1,3 S; 1,4 S; 1,5 H; 1,6 is space)\nRow 2: #S   A # (positions 2,1 S; 2,5 A)\nRow 3: #S     # (position 3,1 S)\nRow 4: #   AA # (positions 4,3 A; 4,4 A)\nRow 5: #      # (all spaces)\nRow 6: #      # (all spaces)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the current epoch is 16. The snake's head (H) is at row 1, column 5 (since rows are 0-7, columns 0-7). Let's confirm: row 1 is \"#SSSSH #\", so indexes 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 5:H, 6: space, 7: #. So H is at (1,5).\n\nThe snake's body (S) is in positions: Let's track the snake's body. The head is at (1,5). Since the direction is RIGHT, the previous position (the body part before the head) would be to the LEFT of the head. So the body parts are:\n\nH is at (1,5). The next part (since direction is RIGHT, the body follows the head's path). Let's look at row 1: positions 1-4 are S. So the body is (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). Then row 2, position 2,1 is S. Row 3, position 3,1 is S. So the snake's body is a vertical line going down from (1,1) to (3,1), then turns right to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) as the head. So the snake's body positions are:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) (head). Wait, row 2 has #S   A #, so (2,1) is S. Row 3 has #S     #, so (3,1) is S. So the snake's body is:\n\nStarting from (3,1) S, then (2,1) S, then (1,1) S, then (1,2) S, (1,3) S, (1,4) S, and (1,5) H. So the snake's body is a vertical line from (3,1) up to (1,1), then turns right through (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). That makes sense. So the length of the snake is 7 (since there are 6 S's and 1 H: 1 (H) + 6 (S) = 7? Let's count: row 1 has 4 S's (columns 1-4) and H at 5. Row 2 has 1 S (column 1). Row 3 has 1 S (column 1). So total S's: 4 +1 +1 =6. So the snake's length is 7 (since head is 1, body 6).\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, so the next move (if direction remains RIGHT) would take the head from (1,5) to (1,6). Let's check what's at (1,6). The row 1 is \"#SSSSH #\", so column 6 is a space (since after H (column 5) is a space (column 6) and then column 7 is #. So (1,6) is a space. If the snake moves RIGHT, the new head position is (1,6). Then, since the snake is moving, the tail (the last body part) would move forward. But if the snake doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves. Let's see where the tail is. The tail is the last part of the body. The snake's body is (3,1) → (2,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (1,5) H. So the tail is (3,1). When the snake moves RIGHT, the new head is (1,6). The body parts shift: the previous head (1,5) becomes S, (1,4) becomes S, etc. So the new body would be (2,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (1,5) → (1,6) H. The tail (3,1) would be removed (since the snake isn't growing). So moving RIGHT is possible, but there's no apple there. The apple positions are (2,5), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nNow, the possible directions the player can choose are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. But the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is RIGHT, so reversing would be LEFT (since RIGHT's opposite is LEFT). So the snake cannot turn directly to LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse and not allowed).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. RIGHT (current direction, allowed). New head position (1,6). That's a space. No apple. The snake moves there, tail (3,1) is removed. No collision. Safe.\n\n2. UP: Current head is at (1,5). Moving UP would take it to (0,5). But row 0 is the top wall (all #). So (0,5) is a wall. Collision. Game ends. So UP is invalid.\n\n3. DOWN: Head at (1,5). Moving DOWN would take it to (2,5). Let's check (2,5). The row 2 is \"#S   A #\", so column 5 is A (apple). So (2,5) is an apple. So if the snake moves DOWN, it will eat the apple. Then, the snake grows in length. So the tail doesn't get removed. Let's see the current tail: (3,1). When the snake eats an apple, the tail remains. So the new head is (2,5). The body parts shift, but since the snake grows, the tail (3,1) stays. Let's track the movement. The previous head was (1,5). After moving DOWN to (2,5), the new head is (2,5). The previous head (1,5) becomes S. The body parts before that: (1,4) S, (1,3) S, (1,2) S, (1,1) S, (2,1) S, (3,1) S (tail). So the new body would be (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) as S, and head at (2,5). That's safe. No collision with walls or self. Because (2,5) is an apple, which is not a wall or S. So moving DOWN would eat the apple, increase the score, and the snake grows.\n\n4. LEFT: Not allowed, as it's the reverse direction of RIGHT (current direction). So the player can't choose LEFT.\n\nSo the possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN. UP leads to wall collision (game over). RIGHT leads to moving to a safe space but no apple. DOWN leads to eating an apple (good) and safe. So the best choice is DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSSH #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction (RIGHT), and possible moves:\n\n1. **Current Head Position**: The snake's head (H) is at (1,5) (row 1, column 5).  \n2. **Forbidden Direction**: The snake cannot reverse direction. Since the current direction is RIGHT, turning LEFT (reverse) is invalid.  \n3. **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (1,5) would take the head to (0,5), which is a wall (`#`). This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (1,5) leads to (1,6), a safe empty space. No apple is present here, so the snake moves without growing. **Safe but no score gain**.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,5) leads to (2,5), which contains an apple (`A`). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows (tail does not shrink). The new head position (2,5) is safe (no collision with walls or self). **Safe and scores a point**.  \n\nThe best move is DOWN, as it safely eats an apple and avoids collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #SSSSS # (so positions (1,1) to (1,5) are S, since index starts at 0 maybe? Let's check coordinates. Let's consider (row, column), with rows 0-7 and columns 0-7. Each row starts with # and ends with #. So row 1 is index 1, columns 0 is #, columns 1-5 are S, column 6 is space, column 7 is #. So (1,1) to (1,5) are S.\n\nRow 2: #S   H # → columns 0 is #, (2,1) is S, then spaces at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) is H, column 5 is space, column 6 is space, column 7 is #. So H is at (2,4).\n\nRow 3: #SA    # → (3,1) is S, (3,2) is A, then spaces. So (3,1)=S, (3,2)=A.\n\nRow 4: #   AA # → (4,3)=A, (4,4)=A. Because row 4 starts with #, then three spaces (columns 1-3), then A at (4,4) and (4,5)? Wait, let's count: row 4 is \"#   AA #\". So column 0: #, column 1: space, column 2: space, column 3: space, column 4: A, column 5: A, column 6: space, column 7: #. So (4,4)=A, (4,5)=A.\n\nRow 5: #      # → all spaces except edges.\nRow 6: #      # → same.\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at (2,4). Since the current direction is DOWN, the next move would be the head moving down one row. Let's check where the head would go if we continue moving DOWN.\n\nCurrent head position (row, column): (2,4). Moving DOWN would take it to row 3, column 4 (since row increases by 1). Let's check row 3, column 4. Row 3 is \"#SA    #\". Columns 0 is #, 1 is S, 2 is A, 3 is space, 4 is space, 5 is space, 6 is space, 7 is #. So (3,4) is a space. So if we move DOWN, the head goes to (3,4). \n\nBut wait, the snake's body is made of S's. Let's figure out the snake's body segments. The head is H at (2,4). The body is S's. Let's track the snake's path. Since the snake is moving DOWN, the direction before was probably DOWN (since direction can't reverse). Let's think about the body positions. The snake's length is the number of S's plus 1 (the head). Let's count S's in the board.\n\nRow 1 has 5 S's (columns 1-5: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)).\nRow 2 has 1 S at (2,1).\nRow 3 has 1 S at (3,1).\nTotal S's: 5 +1 +1 =7. So the snake's length is 7 (body) +1 (head) =8.\n\nThe snake's movement: when moving, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So the body is the previous positions of the head. So the head was moving, and each S is where the head was in previous steps.\n\nCurrent head at (2,4). Let's think about the direction. Current direction is DOWN, so the next head position is (3,4). Let's check if that's a valid position (not wall, not body).\n\n(3,4) is space, not a wall (walls are at column 0 and 7, rows 0 and 7). So no wall collision. Now, is (3,4) part of the body (S)? Let's check all S positions. The S's are at (1,1-5), (2,1), (3,1). So (3,4) is not S. So moving DOWN is possible.\n\nBut are there any apples in the path? Let's check the next positions. The current apples are at (3,2) (from row 3: #SA → (3,2)=A), (4,4), (4,5) (row 4: #   AA → (4,4) and (4,5) are A).\n\nIf we move DOWN to (3,4), there's no apple there. Then, what other directions can we turn? The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is DOWN. The possible directions are UP (reverse, not allowed), LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. Wait, the rule says \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So if current direction is DOWN, reversing would be UP. So allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since continuing same direction is allowed). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. DOWN: next head position (3,4). As before, safe. No apple here.\n\n2. LEFT: direction is LEFT. So the head would move from (2,4) to (2,3) (column decreases by 1). Let's check (2,3). The current row 2 is \"#S   H #\". So (2,3) is a space. So (2,3) is safe. Any apple there? (2,3) is space, no.\n\n3. RIGHT: direction is RIGHT. Head moves to (2,5). Let's check (2,5). Row 2 is \"#S   H #\". So (2,5) is space (since H is at (2,4), then (2,5) is space). So (2,5) is safe. No apple there.\n\nBut maybe we should look for apples. Let's see where the apples are. Apples are at (3,2), (4,4), (4,5). The snake's head is at (2,4). Let's think about the path to the apples.\n\nIf current direction is DOWN, moving to (3,4). Then next possible moves. Let's see if moving DOWN again would take the head towards (4,4) which is an apple. (3,4) → moving DOWN again would be (4,4), which is an apple. Oh! That's a good point. Because if we move DOWN now (epoch 17), then in the next step (epoch 18), if we continue DOWN, the head would be at (4,4), which is an apple. But wait, the question is about the direction we choose now (epoch 17). The movement in epoch 17 is determined by the direction we choose. So the direction we choose now (epoch 17) will determine where the head moves in this step.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing. The player provides direction inputs. The direction input changes the direction the snake is facing, but the snake can't reverse. So when the player gives a direction, the snake's movement direction becomes that direction (if allowed). Then the snake moves one square in that direction.\n\nSo in the current state, the snake is moving DOWN. The player can choose to change direction to LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since UP is reverse). So the direction input now (epoch 17) is the direction the snake will move in this step.\n\nSo the head's current position is (2,4). Let's list possible directions and their next positions:\n\n- DOWN: (2,4) → (3,4) (row increases by 1). Check (3,4) in the current board. The current row 3 is \"#SA    #\", which is columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:A, 3: space, 4: space, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So (3,4) is space. So that's safe.\n\n- LEFT: (2,4) → (2,3). Row 2: \"#S   H #\", so (2,3) is space. Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (2,4) → (2,5). Row 2: \"#S   H #\", (2,5) is space. Safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads to eating an apple as soon as possible?\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\nApple at (3,2): position (row 3, column 2). To reach that, the head would need to move left from (2,4) to (2,3), then (2,2), then (2,1) (but (2,1) is S, which is body. Oh, (2,1) is S, so that's part of the snake's body. So moving left from (2,4) to (2,3) (safe), then (2,2) (safe), then (2,1) (S, collision). So can't go that way.\n\nApple at (4,4): (row 4, column 4). To reach that, if current direction is DOWN, moving to (3,4) (this step). Then next step, if direction is DOWN again, move to (4,4) (which is an apple). So in this step (epoch 17), moving DOWN would take us to (3,4), then next step (epoch 18) moving DOWN again would reach (4,4) (apple). So that's a good path.\n\nApple at (4,5): (row 4, column 5). To reach that, maybe moving RIGHT from (2,4) to (2,5) (this step), then DOWN to (3,5), then DOWN to (4,5) (which is an apple). (4,5) is A. Let's check (3,5) and (4,5):\n\nCurrent row 3: \"#SA    #\", (3,5) is space. (4,5) is A. So if we go RIGHT now (epoch 17), head moves to (2,5). Then next step (epoch 18) direction could be DOWN, moving to (3,5). Then epoch 19, direction DOWN to (4,5) (apple). That's another path.\n\nBut which is better? Let's check possible collisions. Let's check the snake's body positions to avoid collision.\n\nThe snake's body (S's) are at:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nRow 2: (1,1)? Wait, row 2 is \"#S   H #\", so (2,1) is S.\n\nRow 3: \"#SA    #\", so (3,1) is S.\n\nSo S positions are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (3,1).\n\nSo the body is in those positions. Let's check if moving in any direction would cause the head to hit the body in the next step.\n\nFor example, moving LEFT to (2,3): (2,3) is not S, safe. Moving RIGHT to (2,5): (2,5) is not S, safe. Moving DOWN to (3,4): (3,4) is not S, safe.\n\nNow, what about after moving, the next positions. Let's see the snake's body movement. When the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the body is the previous positions of the head. For example, if the head was at (2,4) and moves to (3,4), then the body segments will shift. The last S (the tail) will be removed unless the snake eats an apple (which increases length).\n\nIn the current scenario, the snake hasn't eaten an apple yet in this move, so the tail will move. Let's say the current body is S's in positions: Let's think of the snake's body as a list, with the head at (2,4). The body would be the previous positions. Since the direction is DOWN, the previous head positions would be moving down. Let's reconstruct the path.\n\nSuppose the snake's movement history (from earliest to latest):\n\nAssuming the snake was moving DOWN, the head positions would have been:\n\nLet's think: current head is at (2,4). The body S's are in (1,1-5), (2,1), (3,1). That's a bit confusing. Maybe the snake's body is arranged in a way that it's a longer snake. For example, the S's in row 1, columns 1-5 (positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)) could be part of a horizontal segment. Then (2,1) is S, which is below (1,1). Then (3,1) is S, below (2,1). So the snake's body is like a horizontal line in row 1 (columns 1-5), then down to (2,1), (3,1). So the snake's head is at (2,4), which is to the right of (1,4) (since (1,4) is S). So perhaps the snake's path is: (1,5) → (1,4) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the head is moving right, then down. Maybe the head was moving right, then turned down.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to focus on the current possible moves. The key is to avoid collision and eat apples.\n\nThe apple at (4,4) is in row 4, column 4. If we move DOWN now (epoch 17), head goes to (3,4). Then next step (epoch 18), moving DOWN again, head goes to (4,4) which is an apple. That's a direct path. So that's a good move.\n\nIf we move RIGHT now (epoch 17), head goes to (2,5). Then in epoch 18, moving DOWN, head goes to (3,5). Then epoch 19, moving DOWN to (4,5), which is an apple. That's also a path, but takes one more step.\n\nThe apple at (3,2) is in row 3, column 2. To reach that, the head would need to move left multiple times, but (2,1) is S (body), so if the head moves left to (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) (which is S → collision). So that's not safe.\n\nSo the best option is to move DOWN, which allows us to reach (4,4) apple in the next step. So the direction to choose is DOWN.\n\n\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S   H #\n#SA    #\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (2,4) (row 2, column 4). The body (S) occupies positions: (1,1)-(1,5), (2,1), (3,1).\n2. **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid).\n3. **Apples**: Located at (3,2), (4,4), (4,5).\n4. **Possible Moves**: LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since UP is reversed and invalid).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: Head moves to (2,3) (space, safe). No apple here. Further left would lead toward (2,1) (body), risking collision.\n- **RIGHT**: Head moves to (2,5) (space, safe). No apple here. Next steps could lead toward (4,5) (apple), but requires more moves.\n- **DOWN**: Head moves to (3,4) (space, safe). From (3,4), the next DOWN move (epoch 18) would reach (4,4), which is an apple. This is the shortest path to an apple.\n\nChoosing DOWN allows the snake to reach the apple at (4,4) in the next epoch, maximizing score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S   S #\n# A  H #\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, and the epoch is 18. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. The snake is moving down right now. The goal is to choose a direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) that doesn't cause a collision and allows the snake to eat apples if possible. Also, the snake can't reverse direction. Since the current direction is DOWN, the snake can't immediately go UP (that's a reverse). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n\nFirst, let's locate the head. Looking at the board, the third row (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top) is \"# A  H #\". So row 3, column 5 (since columns are 0 from left). Let's confirm the positions. The rows are:\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7)\nRow 1: #SSSSS # → columns 1-5 are S (since index 1 to 5)\nRow 2: #S   S # → columns 1 is S, column 5 is S\nRow 3: # A  H # → column 2 is A, column 5 is H (so H is at (3,5))\nRow 4: #   AA # → columns 3 and 4 are A\nRow 5: #      # → empty\nRow 6: #      # → empty\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo the head is at (3,5). Current direction is DOWN, so the next move would be to (4,5) if direction remains DOWN. Let's check that cell. Row 4 is \"#   AA #\", so columns 3 and 4 are A. Column 5 in row 4: let's see. The row 4 is \"#   AA #\", which is 8 characters. Let's index each character:\n\nRow 4:\n0: #\n1: (space)\n2: (space)\n3: A\n4: A\n5: (space)\n6: (space)\n7: #\nSo (4,5) is a space. So moving DOWN would take H to (4,5), which is empty. Then, the snake's body would follow. But since the snake's length is the number of S plus 1 (since H is the head). Let's count the S's. Row 1: 5 S's (columns 1-5). Row 2: two S's (columns 1 and 5). So total S's: 5 + 2 =7. So the snake's length is 7 +1 (head) =8. When moving, the head moves to new position, and the body follows, with the tail (last S) possibly moving forward. So if the snake moves down to (4,5), the new head is there. Then, the body segments shift: the previous head (3,5) becomes S, and the tail (the last S) would be removed if the snake didn't eat an apple. But in this case, moving to (4,5) is a space, so no apple eaten, so the snake's length remains the same, so the tail (the last S) would disappear. Wait, but how does the snake's body move? Normally, in snake games, each body segment follows the one in front. So when the head moves, each S moves to the position of the previous S. So the length remains the same unless an apple is eaten.\n\nNow, possible directions. Current direction is DOWN. The snake can't go UP (reverse). So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Direction DOWN: Next head position is (4,5). What's there? As above, (4,5) is a space. So no collision. The snake moves there. The next body positions would be (3,5) (now S), (3,4) (if that's the next S?), wait, need to know the snake's body path. Let's figure out the snake's body positions.\n\nCurrent snake's head is at (3,5). Let's trace the body. The body is S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1 (row index 1): columns 1,2,3,4,5 → (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nRow 2 (row index 2): columns 1 and 5 → (2,1), (2,5)\n\nSo all S positions: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,5). Plus head at (3,5).\n\nSo the snake's body is a chain. Let's think about the order. The head is at (3,5). The next segment (the body part following the head) would be where the head was before moving. Let's assume the snake was moving down, so previous head position would be (2,5) (since current direction is DOWN, previous step the head was at (2,5), then moved down to (3,5)). Because in the current board, (2,5) is S. Oh, right! Because (2,5) is S. So the head was at (2,5) in the previous step, moved down to (3,5), making (2,5) a body segment (S). So the body is in a path. Let's reconstruct the snake's path:\n\nCurrent head at (3,5). The previous position (before moving down) was (2,5) (which is now S). Then before that, the head was at (1,5) (since (1,5) is S). Then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1). Let's check: (1,1) is S, (2,1) is S. So the snake's body is arranged as:\n\nHead (H) at (3,5)\n\nThen (2,5) (S)\n\nThen (1,5) (S)\n\nThen (1,4) (S)\n\nThen (1,3) (S)\n\nThen (1,2) (S)\n\nThen (1,1) (S)\n\nThen (2,1) (S) → that's the tail?\n\nBecause (2,1) is S. So the snake's body is a chain: (3,5) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (1,4) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (2,1). So the length is 8 (head + 7 S's). So when moving, the tail (2,1) would move if no apple is eaten. Let's confirm: if the snake moves down to (4,5), the new head is (4,5). Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous one. So (3,5) becomes S (the new position after head moves), (2,5) becomes S (moves from (3,5)), (1,5) becomes S (moves from (2,5)), (1,4) from (1,5), (1,3) from (1,4), (1,2) from (1,3), (1,1) from (1,2), (2,1) from (1,1). Wait, but then the tail (2,1) would move to (1,1), so the new tail would be (2,1) moving to (1,1), but (1,1) was previously S. Hmm, maybe I need a better way.\n\nAlternatively, the snake's body is the set of positions that the head has been in over the last (length-1) steps. Since the snake's length is 8 (H + 7 S's), each step, the head moves, and the body follows, so the tail is the position that the head was in 7 steps ago. So when moving, the head's new position is added, and the tail (oldest position) is removed unless an apple is eaten (which increases length, so tail isn't removed).\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Let's focus on possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Continue moving DOWN. Next head position (4,5). What's there? Row 4, column 5 is a space (as per row 4: \"#   AA #\", which is [ '#', ' ', ' ', 'A', 'A', ' ', ' ', '#' ]). So (4,5) is ' '. So no collision. Safe.\n\nOption 2: Turn LEFT. The direction would be LEFT. Since current direction is DOWN, turning LEFT is allowed (not reverse). The head is at (3,5). Moving LEFT would take it to (3,4). What's (3,4)? Let's check row 3: \"# A  H #\" → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'H', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (3,4) is a space. So moving LEFT to (3,4) is safe.\n\nOption 3: Turn RIGHT. Direction RIGHT. Current head (3,5). Moving RIGHT would go to (3,6). Check row 3, column 6: it's a space (since row 3 is \"# A  H #\", column 6 is ' '). So (3,6) is safe.\n\nNow, check for apples. Are any of these positions apples?\n\nCurrent apples are 'A's. Let's find all A positions.\n\nRow 3: column 2 is A → (3,2)\n\nRow 4: columns 3 and 4 are A → (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSo the apples are at (3,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (4,5): no apple there. So no score increase.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT to (3,4): (3,4) is space. No apple.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (3,6): (3,6) is space. No apple.\n\nWait, what about other possible directions? Let's check if any direction leads to an apple.\n\nWhat if the snake changes direction to UP? But current direction is DOWN, so reversing direction to UP is not allowed. So UP is invalid. So the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nNow, check for collision possibilities. Let's check each possible move:\n\n- DOWN: (4,5). Check if (4,5) is a wall or body. The walls are the first and last rows and columns. (4,5) is row 4 (not 0 or 7), column 5 (not 0 or 7). So not a wall. Body positions are all the S's. Are any of the S's at (4,5)? The current S positions are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,5). (4,5) is not among them, so safe.\n\n- LEFT: (3,4). Check if (3,4) is S. The S positions are the ones listed. (3,4) is not in the S positions, so safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (3,6). Check if (3,6) is S. The S positions don't include (3,6), so safe.\n\nSo all three directions (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) are safe. Now, the next step is to see which direction leads to the best path for getting apples. Let's look at the positions of the apples. The apples are at (3,2), (4,3), (4,4). The head is at (3,5). Let's see the path to these apples.\n\nIf the snake continues moving DOWN to (4,5), then next possible moves. From (4,5), possible directions (since current direction would then be DOWN, so can't go UP). Next move could be DOWN again (to (5,5)), LEFT (to (4,4)), RIGHT (to (4,6)), etc. (4,4) is an apple! Oh, right! (4,4) is an apple. So if the snake moves DOWN to (4,5), then the next move could be LEFT to (4,4), which is an apple. That would allow the snake to eat an apple next step.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake turns LEFT now (from (3,5) to (3,4)), then from (3,4), possible directions (current direction would be LEFT, so can't go RIGHT). Next moves could be LEFT (to (3,3)), UP (can't, since current direction is LEFT, which allows UP, DOWN, or LEFT (no reverse)), etc. (3,3) is space, (3,2) is an apple. So from (3,4), moving LEFT to (3,3) then LEFT to (3,2) (apple).\n\nAlternatively, if the snake turns RIGHT (to (3,6)), then next moves could be RIGHT (to (3,7) which is a wall, so that's bad), or DOWN (to (4,6)), which is safe but not near apples.\n\nSo let's compare the options:\n\nOption 1: DOWN. Next position (4,5). Then, next possible direction LEFT (to (4,4)), which is an apple. So in two steps, the snake can eat an apple.\n\nOption 2: LEFT. Next position (3,4). Then, moving LEFT again (to (3,3)), then LEFT to (3,2) (apple). That's two steps to reach (3,2).\n\nOption 3: RIGHT. Next position (3,6). Then, moving DOWN to (4,6), which is safe, but (4,6) is space, and then maybe move LEFT towards (4,4) (apple), but that's further.\n\nSo which is better? Let's see the distance.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (4,4) (apple) via DOWN then LEFT: (3,5) → (4,5) (DOWN) → (4,4) (LEFT). That's two steps.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,2) (apple) via LEFT, LEFT, LEFT: (3,5) → (3,4) (LEFT) → (3,3) (LEFT) → (3,2) (LEFT). That's three steps.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (4,4) is two steps. So moving DOWN first allows reaching (4,4) in two steps, which is an apple. So that's better.\n\nSo the best direction now is to continue moving DOWN, so that in the next step, the snake can move LEFT to (4,4) (apple).\n\nWait, but when the snake moves DOWN to (4,5), what's the new direction? The direction would be DOWN (since we chose to move DOWN). Then, in the next step, the direction can be changed to LEFT (since current direction is DOWN, so LEFT is allowed). So yes, moving DOWN now allows the next move to be LEFT to get the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves DOWN now, then the head is at (4,5), and the next move direction can be LEFT (to (4,4)), which is an apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nSo the best direction here is DOWN. Because it allows the snake to get to (4,5), then next step to (4,4) (apple). So choosing DOWN now.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S   S #\n# A  H #\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,5) (row 3, column 5) and is currently moving DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so UP is invalid. The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (4,5), which is empty (no collision with walls or body). This positions the snake to potentially move LEFT next (to (4,4)), which is an apple, allowing it to eat and grow.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (3,4), which is empty but farther from the nearest apple (requires 3 steps to reach (3,2)).  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (3,6), which is empty but leads away from apples and risks wall collision if continued right.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to continue moving DOWN, as it positions the snake to reach an apple in the next step. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls (###) around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #SSSSS # (so positions (1,1) to (1,5) are 'S' (snake body), (1,6) is space)\nRow 2: #S   S # (positions (2,1) is 'S', (2,5) is 'S', others in between are spaces)\nRow 3: # A  S # (positions (3,2) is 'A' (apple), (3,5) is 'S')\nRow 4: #  AAH # (positions (4,3) is 'A', (4,4) is 'A', (4,5) is 'H' (head))\nRow 5: #      # (all spaces)\nRow 6: #      # (all spaces)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at (4,5) (since rows are 0-7, columns 0-7). The current direction is DOWN, which means the snake is moving downward. Let's confirm the snake's body positions to know its length and possible collision points.\n\nLooking at the body 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,5)\nRow 3: (2,5) is 'S' in row 2, row 3 has (3,5) as 'S'\nRow 4: (4,5) is 'H', so the body is connected. Let's track the snake's body from head backwards. Since the direction is DOWN, the head was moving down, so the previous position of the head would be above (4,5), which is (3,5). Let's check: (3,5) is 'S' (row 3, column 5). That's the body, which was the head's previous position. Then, the next body part would be (2,5) (row 2, column 5), which is 'S'. Then (1,5) (row 1, column 5) is 'S'. So that's a vertical segment from (1,5) down to (3,5), then (4,5) is the head. Then, in row 1, there are S's from (1,1) to (1,5), so (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) are part of the body. Row 2 has (2,1) as 'S'. So the snake's body is a bit complex. Let's list all S positions:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) is H.\n\nSo the snake's body is: H is at (4,5). The next part (tail direction) is (3,5) (since direction was down, the head moved from (3,5) to (4,5)), then (2,5), then (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1). So the snake's body is a bit of a U-shape maybe?\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake can't reverse direction, so the possible directions are UP (reverse of DOWN is not allowed, wait, wait. The problem says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, the example says: if current direction is UP, can't turn to DOWN, etc. So the possible directions are the ones that are not the reverse. So current direction is DOWN. The reverse direction would be UP (since moving down, reversing would be up). So the snake can't turn UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n\nNow, the head is at (4,5). Let's find the next positions based on possible directions.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So the next move, if direction remains DOWN, the head moves to (5,5). Let's check (5,5): row 5 is \"#      #\", so (5,5) is a space (since row 5's columns are 0: '#', 1-6: ' ', 7: '#'). So (5,5) is safe (not a wall, not a body part).\n\nIf the direction is LEFT: the head would move to (4,4). Let's check (4,4) on the board. The row 4 is \"#  AAH #\", so columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: 'A', 5: 'H', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (4,4) is 'A' (an apple). So moving LEFT would take the head to (4,4), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple would increase the score and the snake grows. Also, (4,4) is not a body part (since body parts are the S's listed earlier). So that's a valid move.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: head moves to (4,6). Check (4,6): row 4, column 6 is ' ' (since row 4 is \"#  AAH #\", column 6 is the 6th character, which is ' ' (since columns 0 is '#', 1-2 ' ', 3 'A', 4 'A', 5 'H', 6 ' ', 7 '#')). So (4,6) is a space, safe.\n\nIf direction is UP: the reverse direction of current (DOWN), which is not allowed. So UP is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nNow, let's check each possible direction's outcome.\n\nOption 1: DOWN. Next position (5,5). Is that safe? (5,5) is a space. The snake's body is at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). (5,5) is not in these positions, so no collision. So moving DOWN is safe, but there's no apple there. The snake would just move to (5,5), and the tail would move (since length is current length. Let's see current length: the head is H, and the body is S's. How many S's are there? Let's count S's in the board.\n\nRow 1: 5 S's (columns 1-5)\nRow 2: 2 S's (columns 1 and 5)\nRow 3: 1 S (column 5)\nTotal S's: 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. So the snake's length is 8 + 1 (head) = 9. Each time the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves (so the length remains 9). If it eats an apple, the length increases by 1 (so tail doesn't move, the snake grows).\n\nSo if moving DOWN, head goes to (5,5), and the tail (the last S) would be removed. But since there's no apple, the snake's length stays 9.\n\nOption 2: LEFT. Head moves to (4,4), which is an apple. So eating the apple. The snake's length increases by 1. So the tail doesn't move (since when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail stays, and the head moves forward, adding a new segment). So after moving LEFT, the head is at (4,4), which was an apple. The previous head position (4,5) becomes S (since the snake grows, the body extends). So the new body would include (4,5) as S. Let's check if (4,4) is a body part. The current body parts are the S's listed before. (4,4) is 'A' in the current board, so not a body part. So moving LEFT is safe, and the snake eats an apple. That's a good move.\n\nOption 3: RIGHT. Head moves to (4,6), which is a space. No apple. The snake moves, tail moves. No collision. Safe, but no score gain.\n\nSo which direction is best? The goal is to eat as many apples as possible. So moving LEFT would allow the snake to eat an apple (since (4,4) is 'A'). That's better than moving DOWN or RIGHT, which don't eat apples.\n\nWait, let's confirm (4,4) in the current board. The row 4 is \"#  AAH #\". Let's index the columns from 0 to 7. So row 4:\n\ncolumns 0: '#'\ncolumn 1: ' '\ncolumn 2: ' '\ncolumn 3: 'A'\ncolumn 4: 'A'\ncolumn 5: 'H'\ncolumn 6: ' '\ncolumn 7: '#'\n\nYes, (4,4) is 'A' (row 4, column 4). So moving LEFT (from (4,5) to (4,4)) would take the head to that 'A'. So that's an apple. So that's a valid move, safe (no collision with body or wall). The direction LEFT is allowed because current direction is DOWN, and LEFT is not the reverse (reverse is UP). So LEFT is allowed.\n\nSo the best direction is LEFT, as it allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S   S #\n# A  S #\n#  AAH #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4,5) (row 4, column 5). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (5,5), which is a safe empty space but contains no apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: The head would move to (4,6), which is a safe empty space but contains no apple.  \n- **LEFT**: The head would move to (4,4), which is occupied by an apple ('A'). Moving LEFT is valid (not a reverse of DOWN) and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing the snake.  \n\nEating the apple is optimal for maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. The board is 8x8 with walls as #. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S', and apples are 'A'. The current direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 20. \n\nFirst, let's parse the game board. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #SSSSS # (so positions (1,1) to (1,6) are S, except (1,6) is space? Wait, the row is \"#SSSSS #\", so indexes 0 is #, 1-5 are S, 6 is space, 7 is #. So (1,1)=S, (1,2)=S, (1,3)=S, (1,4)=S, (1,5)=S, (1,6)= space.\nRow 2: #S A S # → columns 0=#, 1=S, 2= space, 3=A, 4= space, 5=S, 6= space, 7=#. So (2,1)=S, (2,3)=A, (2,5)=S.\nRow 3: # A  S # → columns 0=#, 1= space, 2=A, 3= space, 4= space, 5=S, 6= space, 7=#. So (3,2)=A, (3,5)=S.\nRow 4: #  AHS # → columns 0=#, 1= space, 2= space, 3=A, 4=H, 5=S, 6= space, 7=#. So (4,3)=A, (4,4)=H (head), (4,5)=S (body).\nRow 5: #      # → all spaces except walls.\nRow 6: #      # → same.\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. So the head is moving left. Let's find the head position. From row 4: #  AHS #. So columns 0-7: 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is space, 3 is A, 4 is H, 5 is S, 6 is space, 7 is #. So head (H) is at (4,4). The body segments are S. Let's track the snake's body. Since the direction is LEFT, the next move would be to (4,3) if moving left. Let's check where the body is.\n\nLooking at the body positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) → S's here. So that's a horizontal line of S's from (1,1) to (1,5).\n\nRow 2: (2,1)=S, (2,5)=S.\n\nRow 3: (3,5)=S.\n\nRow 4: (4,5)=S (since row 4 is #  AHS # → (4,5) is S). \n\nSo the snake's body is connected. Let's think about the snake's path. Since direction is LEFT, the head is moving left. The head is at (4,4). So if the snake continues moving LEFT, the next position is (4,3). Let's check what's there. (4,3) is A (apple), as per row 4: #  AHS # → column 3 is A. So if the snake moves LEFT, the head goes to (4,3), which is an apple. Eating the apple would make the snake grow. The body would then extend, so the previous head (4,4) becomes S, and the new head is (4,3). That's a good move because it eats an apple, increasing the score. \n\nBut wait, we need to check if moving LEFT is possible. The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is LEFT. The possible directions to turn are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. Reversing would be RIGHT, which is not allowed. So the possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nNow, let's check if moving LEFT would cause a collision. The next position is (4,3). Is that a wall? The walls are the first and last columns (0 and 7) and first and last rows (0 and 7). (4,3) is row 4, column 3. Column 3 is within 1-6 (since 0 and 7 are walls), so not a wall. Is (4,3) part of the snake's body? Let's check existing S positions. The current S positions are:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,5)\n\nRow 3: (3,5)\n\nRow 4: (4,5)\n\nSo (4,3) is not in any of these positions. So moving LEFT would be safe. The head moves to (4,3) (A), eats it, grows. The score increases by 1. \n\nWhat about other directions? Let's check UP, DOWN, and RIGHT (but RIGHT is reverse of LEFT, so not allowed). \n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse, so RIGHT is invalid. So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nIf we choose UP: The head is at (4,4). Moving UP would take it to (3,4). Let's check (3,4). Row 3 is \"# A  S #\", which is columns 0=#, 1= space, 2=A, 3= space, 4= space, 5=S, 6= space, 7=#. So (3,4) is space. Is that part of the snake's body? Current S positions: (3,5) is S, (3,4) is space. So (3,4) is safe. But there's no apple there, so the snake moves, and the tail (the end of the body) would move. The snake's length would remain the same (since no apple eaten). \n\nIf we choose DOWN: Head is at (4,4). Moving DOWN would go to (5,4). Row 5 is \"#      #\", so (5,4) is space. Safe, but no apple. \n\nIf we choose LEFT: (4,3) is A. So that's the best option, as it eats an apple. \n\nSo the best direction is LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S A S #\n# A  S #\n#  AHS #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, and the snake's head is at position (4,4). The snake can move in LEFT, UP, or DOWN directions (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed). \n\n- **Moving LEFT**: The head will move to (4,3), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body) and will result in eating the apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake.  \n- **Moving UP**: The head will move to (3,4), which is empty (no apple) and safe but does not provide a score increase.  \n- **Moving DOWN**: The head will move to (5,4), which is empty (no apple) and safe but does not provide a score increase.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move LEFT to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list out each row to visualize it better:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #SSSSS # (so positions (1,1) to (1,5) are S, (1,6) is space)\nRow 2: #S A S # (positions (2,1)=S, (2,3)=A, (2,5)=S)\nRow 3: # A  S # (positions (3,2)=A, (3,5)=S)\nRow 4: #  HSS # (positions (4,3)=H, (4,4)=S, (4,5)=S)\nRow 5: #      # (all spaces except the walls)\nRow 6: #   A  # (position (6,3)=A)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. Let's track the snake's head position. The head is 'H' at (4,3). Since the current direction is LEFT, the next move would be to (4,2) if we continue LEFT. Let's check what's there.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the head's position. In row 4 (index 4), the string is \"#  HSS #\". So the characters are:\nIndex 0: #\nIndex 1: space\nIndex 2: space\nIndex 3: H\nIndex 4: S\nIndex 5: S\nIndex 6: space\nIndex 7: #\nSo H is at (4,3) (row 4, column 3).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is LEFT, the possible directions we can choose are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing would be RIGHT, which is not allowed). So the next direction can't be RIGHT.\n\nLet's think about the next move if we choose each possible direction:\n\n1. Continue LEFT: Moving from (4,3) to (4,2). What's in (4,2)? Looking at row 4, column 2 is a space (since row 4 is \"#  HSS #\", which is positions 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3:H, 4:S, 5:S, 6: space, 7: #). So (4,2) is a space. So the head moves there. Then, the body follows. Since the snake's length is determined by how many 'S' and 'H' are present. Let's count the snake's current length. The snake parts are:\n\nRow 1: S at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) → 5 S\nRow 2: S at (2,1), (2,5) → 2 S\nRow 3: S at (3,5) → 1 S\nRow 4: H at (4,3), S at (4,4), (4,5) → 1 H and 2 S\nTotal: 5+2+1+2 = 10 S, plus H (which is the head) → length is 11. Because the snake starts with length 1 (H) and each 'S' is part of the body, so total length is 1 (H) + number of S's. Let's count S's: in row 1, 5 S; row 2, 2 S; row 3, 1 S; row 4, 2 S. 5+2+1+2=10 S. So length 11.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body part follows the previous one. So the tail (the last S) would move forward. So if the head moves to (4,2), then the body parts would shift. The previous head position (4,3) becomes S, and the next positions follow.\n\nBut first, check for collisions. If moving LEFT to (4,2), is that a wall? No, (4,2) is within the board (columns 1-6 are inside, since columns 0 and 7 are walls). So walls are at column 0 and 7, rows 0 and 7. So (4,2) is safe (column 2 is between 1 and 6). Then check if (4,2) is part of the snake's body. The current body parts are all the S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,5)\nRow 3: (3,5)\nRow 4: (4,4), (4,5)\nSo (4,2) is a space, not an S. So no collision. So moving LEFT is safe. But is there an apple there? Let's check (4,2): row 4, column 2. The row 4 is \"#  HSS #\", so (4,2) is a space. So no apple. So the snake would just move there, no growth.\n\n2. Direction UP: Current direction is LEFT. Turning UP is allowed (since it's not the reverse). The head is at (4,3). Moving UP would take it to (3,3). Let's check (3,3). What's in row 3, column 3? The row 3 is \"# A  S #\", which is:\n\nRow 3: columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: A, 3: space, 4: space, 5: S, 6: space, 7: #. So (3,3) is a space. So moving UP to (3,3). Check collision: (3,3) is a space, not S or wall. Safe. No apple here. So snake moves there, no growth.\n\n3. Direction DOWN: Current direction is LEFT. Turning DOWN is allowed. Head at (4,3) moving DOWN to (5,3). Check (5,3). Row 5 is \"#      #\", which is all spaces except walls. So (5,3) is a space. Safe. No apple. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\n4. Direction RIGHT: Reverse direction (current is LEFT, so RIGHT is reverse). Not allowed. So can't choose RIGHT.\n\nNow, we need to check if any of the possible directions (LEFT, UP, DOWN) leads to an apple. Let's check the positions each direction would move the head to.\n\nCurrent apples on the board: Let's find all 'A's.\n\nRow 2: \"#S A S #\" → column 3 (row 2, column 3) is A. (2,3)\nRow 3: \"# A  S #\" → column 2 (row 3, column 2) is A. (3,2)\nRow 6: \"#   A  #\" → column 3 (row 6, column 3) is A. (6,3)\n\nSo apples at (2,3), (3,2), (6,3).\n\nLet's see where each direction's next head position is:\n\n- LEFT: (4,2). Is (4,2) an apple? No. The apples are at (3,2) (row 3, column 2), which is one row up from (4,2). So (4,2) is (row 4, column 2), which is a space.\n\n- UP: (3,3). (3,3) is a space. The apple in row 3 is at (3,2). So (3,3) is not an apple.\n\n- DOWN: (5,3). (5,3) is a space. The apple in row 6 is at (6,3), which is one row down from (5,3). So (5,3) is not an apple.\n\nSo none of the immediate next moves would eat an apple. So the priority is to avoid collision and choose a direction that allows the snake to move towards apples without getting stuck.\n\nLet's look at the snake's body to see possible future collisions. The snake is quite long, so we need to make sure that the path ahead is clear.\n\nCurrent head is at (4,3). Let's think about the snake's body structure. The snake's body parts are:\n\nLooking at the S's, perhaps the snake's body is arranged in a way that the head is at (4,3), and the body extends. Let's try to figure out the order of the body segments. Since the snake moves, each S is the previous position of the head or a body part.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check possible future moves. Let's see the possible paths.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (4,2), then next move direction could be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again. Let's see (4,2) is a space, then next move (if LEFT again) would be (4,1). (4,1) is in row 4, column 1. Let's check row 4: \"#  HSS #\", column 1 is a space. So (4,1) is a space. Then, moving LEFT again to (4,0) which is a wall (column 0 is a wall), so that's a collision. So moving LEFT multiple times would hit the wall eventually, but maybe not immediately.\n\nIf we go UP to (3,3). Then next possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (since current direction would be UP now). Let's see (3,3) is a space. From (3,3), moving UP would go to (2,3), which is an apple! Oh, (2,3) is an apple (from row 2: \"#S A S #\", column 3 is A). So if the head is at (3,3) (after moving UP), then the next move direction could be UP again (since current direction would be UP). Then moving UP from (3,3) to (2,3) would reach the apple. That's a good path. Because then the snake would eat the apple, grow, and increase the score.\n\nSo here's the plan: current move is to choose UP. Then the head moves to (3,3). Then next epoch (epoch 22), the direction could be UP again (since current direction would be UP), moving to (2,3), which is the apple. That would be a good move.\n\nLet's confirm:\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. Choosing UP as the next direction. The snake moves UP from (4,3) to (3,3). That's allowed. (3,3) is a space, no collision. Then, in the next epoch (epoch 22), the direction would be UP (since that's the new direction). Then the head would move from (3,3) to (2,3), which is the apple (A). Eating that apple would grow the snake and increase the score. That's a good strategy.\n\nIf we choose LEFT now, the head moves to (4,2). Then the next direction could be UP (since direction can't reverse). So from (4,2), moving UP to (3,2) which is an apple! Oh, (3,2) is an apple (row 3, column 2 is A). So (3,2) is an apple. Let's check:\n\nIf current direction is LEFT, and we move LEFT to (4,2). Then the next direction can be UP (since current direction is LEFT, next direction can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT). So from (4,2), moving UP would go to (3,2), which is the apple. That's another possible path.\n\nWait, (4,2) is the head's new position if we move LEFT. Then, (3,2) is in row 3, column 2. Looking at row 3: \"# A  S #\", column 2 is A. So (3,2) is the apple. So if we move LEFT to (4,2) now, then next move (epoch 22) direction UP would take us to (3,2) (apple). That's also a good path.\n\nSo which is better? Let's compare the two options.\n\nOption 1: Move UP now → head at (3,3). Next move (epoch 22) direction UP → (2,3) (apple). \n\nOption 2: Move LEFT now → head at (4,2). Next move (epoch 22) direction UP → (3,2) (apple). \n\nEither way, we can reach an apple in the next step. Let's check if either path has any collision risks.\n\nIn option 1: (3,3) is a space. Then moving UP to (2,3) (apple). (2,3) is A, so no collision. That's safe.\n\nIn option 2: (4,2) is a space. Then moving UP to (3,2) (apple). (3,2) is A, safe.\n\nBut let's check the current body positions. Are there any S's in the path?\n\nFor option 1: (3,3) is a space. The body S's are at (3,5) (row 3, column 5), so (3,3) is not S. So safe.\n\nFor option 2: (4,2) is a space. The body S's in row 4 are (4,4), (4,5), so (4,2) is safe.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's body might block other paths. Let's see the snake's body structure. The snake has a lot of S's in row 1 (columns 1-5), row 2 (columns 1 and 5), row 3 (column 5), row 4 (columns 4 and 5). So the right side (columns 5) has a lot of S's. The left side (columns 1-3) seems more open.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (4,2), then next move to (3,2) (apple) is good, and after that, the snake would grow. Let's think about after eating the apple. The snake's length increases by 1, so the tail doesn't disappear. So the new head would be at (3,2), and the previous head (4,2) becomes S. The rest of the body shifts. That's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3), then to (2,3) (apple) would also work. Let's check (2,3): row 2, column 3 is A, which is between S's at (2,1) and (2,5). So (2,3) is a space (A) and not part of the body. So that's safe.\n\nSo both options are possible. But perhaps moving LEFT is better because (3,2) is an apple, and moving LEFT now allows us to reach that apple in the next step. Let's confirm the positions again.\n\nCurrent head at (4,3). Current direction LEFT.\n\nIf we choose LEFT:\n\nNew head position: (4,3) → move LEFT (column decreases by 1) → (4,2).\n\nCheck (4,2): row 4, column 2. The row 4 is \"#  HSS #\", so (4,0) is #, (4,1) is space, (4,2) is space, (4,3) is H, (4,4) is S, (4,5) is S, (4,6) is space, (4,7) is #. So (4,2) is a space. Safe.\n\nNext move (epoch 22) direction could be UP (since current direction would be LEFT again, but if we change direction to UP, that's allowed). So moving UP from (4,2) (row 4, column 2) to (3,2) (row 3, column 2). Row 3, column 2 is A (from \"# A  S #\"). So that's an apple. So eating it would be good.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose UP now, moving to (3,3), then next move UP to (2,3) (A). Also good.\n\nWhich direction is better? Let's see if there are any obstacles. For example, if we move UP now, (3,3) is a space, then (2,3) is A. After eating that, the next move would be into row 1. Row 1 has a lot of S's (columns 1-5). So (2,3) is A, and moving up to (1,3) would be S (row 1, column 3 is S). Oh! That's a problem. Because (1,3) is S. So after eating the apple at (2,3), the next move (if direction is UP) would take the head to (1,3), which is part of the snake's body (since row 1, column 3 is S). That would cause a collision.\n\nAh! That's a critical point. Let's check:\n\nRow 1 is \"#SSSSS #\". So columns 1-5 are S. So (1,1)=S, (1,2)=S, (1,3)=S, (1,4)=S, (1,5)=S. So (1,3) is S. So if the head moves to (2,3) (apple) in epoch 22, then in epoch 23, if direction is UP again, the head would move to (1,3), which is S. That's a collision. So that path is dangerous.\n\nOn the other hand, if we choose to move LEFT now to (4,2), then next move UP to (3,2) (apple). Let's check what's above (3,2). (3,2) is in row 3, column 2. The row above (row 2, column 2) is part of row 2: \"#S A S #\". So row 2, column 2 is a space (since (2,1)=S, (2,3)=A, (2,5)=S). So (2,2) is space. So after eating (3,2), moving UP to (2,2) would be safe.\n\nLet me detail:\n\nIf we move LEFT now (epoch 21) to (4,2). Then epoch 22, direction UP: head moves to (3,2) (A). Eat the apple, score increases. The snake grows, so the tail doesn't disappear. The new head is (3,2), previous head (4,2) becomes S.\n\nThen epoch 23, direction could be UP again. Head moves from (3,2) to (2,2). Row 2, column 2 is a space (row 2 is \"#S A S #\": columns 0=#, 1=S, 2=space, 3=A, 4=space, 5=S, 6=space, 7=#). So (2,2) is space. Safe.\n\nThat's better. Whereas the other path (UP now) would lead to a possible collision in epoch 23.\n\nAnother point: the snake's current direction is LEFT, so moving LEFT again is allowed, and that path seems safe. Let's confirm that (4,2) is not part of the body. The current S positions are:\n\nRow 1: (1,1-5) → (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,5)\nRow 3: (3,5)\nRow 4: (4,4), (4,5)\nSo (4,2) is not in any of these positions, so no collision.\n\nTherefore, the best direction is LEFT. Because moving LEFT now allows the snake to move towards the apple at (3,2) in the next step, and avoids a potential collision with its own body in the following step.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S A S #\n# A  S #\n#  HSS #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and collision risks. The snake's head ('H') is at (4,3) (row 4, column 3), and it is currently moving LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid), leaving UP, DOWN, or LEFT as options.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (2,3), (3,2), and (6,3).\n2. **Collision Risks**: The snake’s body ('S') occupies positions in rows 1-4 (e.g., (1,1-5), (2,1), (2,5), (3,5), (4,4-5)). Moving into these positions or walls (row\/column 0 or 7) causes a game over.\n3. **Direction Analysis**:\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head from (4,3) to (4,2) (a safe, empty space). From (4,2), the next move UP would reach (3,2), which contains an apple. This path avoids the snake’s body and walls.\n   - **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (3,3) (safe). However, a subsequent UP move would reach (2,3) (an apple), but a further UP move would hit (1,3), which is part of the snake’s body (row 1 has 'S' at (1,3)), causing a collision.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (5,3) (safe) but does not lead toward any apple in the immediate next steps.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is optimal. It allows the snake to safely approach the apple at (3,2) in the next epoch without risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#  A S #\n# A  S #\n# HSSS #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, and the current epoch is 22. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. The snake can't reverse direction, so from LEFT, the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed). Wait, no—wait, the problem says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is LEFT, the player can't turn to RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. Because reversing is not allowed. So the possible next directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nFirst, let's locate the head. The head is in row 4 (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top). Let's count the rows:\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: #SSSSS #\nRow 2: #  A S #\nRow 3: # A  S #\nRow 4: # HSSS #\nRow 5: #      #\nRow 6: #   A  #\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo row 4 is \"# HSSS #\". Let's check the columns. Let's index columns 0-7. The row 4 is:\n\nColumn 0: #\nColumn 1:  \nColumn 2: H\nColumn 3: S\nColumn 4: S\nColumn 5: S\nColumn 6:  \nColumn 7: #\n\nSo the head (H) is at position (row 4, column 2). Because in row 4, the characters are [ '#', ' ', 'H', 'S', 'S', 'S', ' ', '#' ].\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, so the snake is moving left. That means the next position if moving LEFT would be (row 4, column 1). Let's check that cell. In row 4, column 1 is ' ' (space). So moving LEFT would take the head to (4,1). Is that safe?\n\nBut we need to check if moving LEFT would cause a collision. Let's check (4,1). The current cell there is a space, so no collision with the body or wall. So moving LEFT is possible.\n\nNow, what about other directions. Let's consider UP. The current direction is LEFT. Turning UP is allowed (since it's not reversing). If the snake turns UP, the next position is (row 3, column 2). Let's check row 3, column 2. Row 3 is \"# A  S #\". Let's break that down:\n\nRow 3: columns 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is 'A', 3 is ' ', 4 is ' ', 5 is 'S', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So (3,2) is 'A' (an apple). So moving UP would take the head to (3,2), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple would make the snake grow. So that's a possible direction.\n\nWhat's the current snake's body? Let's map the S positions. Let's list all S and H positions.\n\nRow 1: #SSSSS # → columns 1-5 are S. So (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5).\n\nRow 2: #  A S # → column 5 is S → (2,5).\n\nRow 3: # A  S # → column 5 is S → (3,5).\n\nRow 4: # HSSS # → H is (4,2), then S in (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nSo the snake's body segments are:\n\nH at (4,2)\n\nThen the body: Let's think about the snake's movement. Since the current direction is LEFT, the head was moving left. So the body would follow. Let's reconstruct the snake's path. The head is at (4,2). The next body segment (since direction is LEFT) would be where the head was before moving. So previous positions: the snake's length is the number of S and H. Let's count:\n\nH is 1, S in row 1: 5 (columns 1-5), row 2:1 (col5), row3:1 (col5), row4:3 (cols3-5). Let's count all S and H: 1 (H) + 5 (row1) +1 (row2) +1 (row3) +3 (row4) = 11. So the snake's length is 11.\n\nSo the snake's body is a sequence of 11 segments, with H at (4,2) as the head. The next segment (the first body part) would be where the head was in the previous step. Since the direction is LEFT, the previous head position would be (4,3) (since moving left from (4,3) to (4,2)). Then the next segment is (4,4), then (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). Let's confirm:\n\nThe snake's body path:\n\nHead: (4,2) → came from (4,3) (since moving left). So body segments are:\n\n(4,3) → (4,4) → (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (1,4) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1). That's 10 body segments. So total length 11. That makes sense.\n\nSo if the snake moves UP (direction UP), the new head position is (3,2). Let's check if (3,2) is part of the body. The body segments are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). (3,2) is not in any of those. So moving UP is safe. And (3,2) has an 'A' (apple), so eating it would increase the score and the snake would grow. That's a good move.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN? Current direction is LEFT. Turning DOWN is allowed. The next position would be (5,2). Let's check row 5, column 2. Row 5 is \"#      #\", so column 2 is a space. So (5,2) is empty. So moving DOWN is possible, but there's no apple there. The apple in row 6 is at (6,3). So that's not immediately in that direction.\n\nSo the options are:\n\n- LEFT: move to (4,1), which is empty. No apple. Just moves left.\n\n- UP: move to (3,2), which is an apple. Safe, and gains a point.\n\n- DOWN: move to (5,2), empty.\n\nSo the best choice is to move UP, since that's an apple and safe. Let's confirm again.\n\nCurrent head at (4,2). Direction is LEFT. If direction changes to UP, the movement is up (row decreases by 1, column same). So (4-1,2) = (3,2). Check (3,2) on the board: row 3 is \"# A  S #\". Column 2 is 'A' (since row 3, column 2: the characters are [ '#', ' ', 'A', ' ', ' ', 'S', ' ', '#' ]). So (3,2) is 'A'. So moving UP would eat the apple, which is good. Also, (3,2) is not part of the snake's body. So no collision. So that's a safe and beneficial move.\n\nSo the answer should be UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#  A S #\n# A  S #\n# HSSS #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (row 4, column 2).\n- Current direction is LEFT, so the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n- **Moving LEFT**: The next position is (4, 1), which is empty (no apple, no collision). This is safe but does not gain a score.\n- **Moving DOWN**: The next position is (5, 2), which is empty (no apple, no collision). This is safe but does not gain a score.\n- **Moving UP**: The next position is (3, 2). Checking row 3, column 2: the cell contains 'A' (an apple). This position is not part of the snake's body (body segments are at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)), so no collision. Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake.\n\nThe best choice is to move UP to eat the apple and safely grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided. The board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' as walls. The snake's head is 'H', body segments are 'S', apples are 'A'. The current direction is UP, and we need to choose the next direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) that doesn't reverse the current direction. Since current direction is UP, reversing would be DOWN, so we can't choose DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFirst, let's map out the positions. Let's list each row (rows 0 to 7, since it's 8 rows):\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SSSSS # (columns 1-6: S S S S S, column 7 is #)\nRow 2: #  A S # (columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#')\nRow 3: # H  S # (columns 1: ' ', 2: 'H', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#')\nRow 4: #ASSSS # (columns 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#')\nRow 5: #      # (all spaces except walls)\nRow 6: #   A  # (columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#')\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nNow, the snake's head 'H' is at row 3, column 2 (assuming rows are 0-based from top, columns 0-based from left). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 3 is \"# H  S #\". So the characters are: [0]'#', [1]' ', [2]'H', [3]' ', [4]' ', [5]'S', [6]' ', [7]'#'. So H is at (3,2).\n\nCurrent direction is UP, which means the snake is moving upward. So the next head position, if we continue UP, would be (2,2). Let's check what's there. Row 2 is \"#  A S #\", so columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' '. So (2,2) is ' ' (a space). So moving UP would take H to (2,2), which is empty. Then, the body would follow. But we need to check if that's safe (no collision with walls or self).\n\nAlternatively, if we turn LEFT (current direction is UP, LEFT is a 90-degree turn, allowed). The new direction would be LEFT. Then the next head position would be (3,1) (since LEFT decreases column by 1). Let's check (3,1): in row 3, column 1 is ' ', which is empty. So moving LEFT would take H to (3,1), which is safe.\n\nIf we turn RIGHT, direction becomes RIGHT. Next head position would be (3,3). Check row 3, column 3: ' ' (since row 3 is \"# H  S #\", columns 0-7: [0]# [1] [2]H [3] [4] [5]S [6] [7]#. So (3,3) is ' ', which is safe.\n\nWe need to avoid collisions. Let's also check the snake's body positions to see if any of these moves would hit the body.\n\nFirst, current head is at (3,2). The body segments (S) are in various positions. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: columns 1-5 (since row 1 is #SSSSS # → columns 1,2,3,4,5 are S. So (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5).\n\nRow 2: column 5 is S → (2,5).\n\nRow 3: column 5 is S → (3,5).\n\nRow 4: columns 1-5 (row 4 is #ASSSS # → column 1 is A, columns 2-5 are S. So (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nSo S positions are:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5),\n\n(2,5),\n\n(3,5),\n\n(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nNow, possible next positions for the head:\n\n- UP: (2,2). Check if (2,2) is a wall or S. (2,2) is ' ' (from row 2: \"#  A S #\", column 2 is ' '). So safe.\n\n- LEFT: (3,1). (3,1) is ' ', safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (3,3). (3,3) is ' ', safe.\n\nSo all three directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are possible so far. Now, we want to eat apples. Let's check where the apples are. Apples are 'A's on the board.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 2, column 3: (2,3) → A.\n\nRow 4, column 1: (4,1) → A.\n\nRow 6, column 3: (6,3) → A.\n\nSo three apples. Let's see which direction leads towards an apple.\n\nCurrent head is at (3,2). Let's check the next positions and their proximity to apples.\n\nIf we go UP to (2,2): the adjacent cell (2,3) is an apple. So from (2,2), the next move (if direction remains UP) would be (1,2), but maybe after moving UP, the next step could reach the apple. Alternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT from the current position (direction RIGHT) would take H to (3,3), which is adjacent to (2,3) (the apple in row 2, column 3). Let's see: (3,3) is right of H's current position (3,2). Then, if direction is RIGHT, next head is (3,3). Then, moving RIGHT again would take to (3,4), which is (3,4) (row 3, column 4 is ' '), then (3,5) which is S (body), so that's a collision. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, if direction is UP, head moves to (2,2). Then, the next possible direction could be RIGHT to reach (2,3) (the apple). Let's see: (2,3) is the apple. So moving UP first to (2,2), then RIGHT would take H to (2,3), which is the apple. That would be a good move.\n\nAlternatively, if we move RIGHT now (direction RIGHT), head goes to (3,3). Then, from (3,3), moving UP would go to (2,3), which is the apple. So (3,3) → (2,3) (apple) in the next step. That's also possible.\n\nAnother apple is at (4,1) (row 4, column 1). The current head is at (3,2). To reach (4,1), the snake would need to move DOWN (but current direction is UP, can't reverse to DOWN immediately). So if current direction is UP, moving DOWN is not allowed. So that apple is in row 4, which is below the current head (row 3). So unless the snake turns around, which it can't do in one move, that apple might be harder to reach.\n\nThe third apple is at (6,3) (row 6, column 3). That's two rows below row 4, which is in row 5 (empty) and row 6. So that's further down.\n\nSo the closest apples are (2,3) (row 2, column 3) and (4,1) (row 4, column 1). Let's focus on (2,3). If we move UP to (2,2), then next move could be RIGHT to (2,3) (apple). That would be good. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now to (3,3), then UP to (2,3) (apple). Let's check the body positions to make sure these paths are safe.\n\nLet's consider moving UP first. Next head position (2,2). Is (2,2) safe? Yes, as it's a space. Then, the body would shift. The snake's length is the number of S and H. Let's count: H is 1, S's are in row 1 (5), row 2 (1), row 3 (1), row 4 (4). Total S: 5+1+1+4=11. So snake length is 12 (H + 11 S). When moving, the tail (last S) would move if no apple is eaten. Since moving UP to (2,2) (a space), the snake doesn't eat an apple, so the tail (the last S) would be removed. But the problem is, where is the tail? The snake's body is a chain. The head is at (3,2). The body segments are connected. Let's try to figure out the snake's path.\n\nAssuming the snake is moving in UP direction, the previous head position before now would have been (4,2) (since moving UP from (4,2) to (3,2) would be the current position). Let's check row 4, column 2: 'S' (row 4 is #ASSSS # → column 2 is S). So the previous head was (4,2), which is now part of the body. Then, the body continues from (4,2) to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). That makes sense as a chain. So the tail is at (1,1), since that's the end of the S's in row 1.\n\nSo when the snake moves UP to (2,2), the new head is (2,2), and the tail (1,1) is removed. So the new body would be:\n\n(3,2) becomes S (since the head moves up), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). So the new S positions would be these, plus the new head (2,2) is H.\n\nSo moving UP is safe. Now, moving LEFT: new head at (3,1). Let's check (3,1) is a space, so safe. Then, the tail (1,1) would be removed. The new body would be (3,2) as S, (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). The new head is (3,1). That's safe.\n\nMoving RIGHT: new head at (3,3). (3,3) is a space, so safe. Tail (1,1) is removed. New body includes (3,2) as S, etc. So (3,3) is safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads to an apple soonest? Let's check the positions:\n\nIf we go UP to (2,2), then the next move (epoch 24) direction could be RIGHT. Then head moves to (2,3), which is the apple. Eating that apple would increase the score, and the snake grows (so the tail isn't removed). That's good.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (3,3), then next move (epoch 24) direction could be UP. Then head moves to (2,3) (the apple). That's also good. So both directions UP and RIGHT can reach the apple in the next step.\n\nWhat about moving LEFT? (3,1). Then next positions would be (3,0) which is a wall (column 0 is #). So if direction is LEFT, moving again LEFT would hit the wall. But the next move's direction can be changed. Let's see, (3,1) is the new head. Possible next directions: UP, DOWN (can't, since current direction would be LEFT, and reversing LEFT would be RIGHT; wait, the direction after moving LEFT would be LEFT, so the next direction can't be RIGHT (reverse). So next possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT. If we go LEFT again, (3,0) is a wall (row 3, column 0 is #). So that's a collision. So moving LEFT might lead to a dead end unless we turn UP or DOWN. But DOWN would be allowed (since current direction is LEFT, DOWN is not reverse). Let's see, (3,1) → next direction DOWN would go to (4,1). (4,1) is an apple! Oh, right! (4,1) is 'A' (row 4 is #ASSSS # → column 1 is A). So if we move LEFT now (to (3,1)), then next direction is DOWN (since current direction would be LEFT, and DOWN is allowed, not reverse), then head moves to (4,1) which is the apple. That's another possible path.\n\nSo let's map that:\n\nCurrent direction: UP. We choose LEFT. New direction is LEFT. Head moves to (3,1) (epoch 23 → 24). Then, in epoch 24, current direction is LEFT, so possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (can't go RIGHT). If we choose DOWN, direction becomes DOWN. Then head moves from (3,1) to (4,1) (row 4, column 1) which is 'A' (apple). Eating that apple would grow the snake, increase score. That's a good move.\n\nSo moving LEFT now allows us to reach the apple at (4,1) in the next step. Let's confirm (4,1) is indeed an apple. Row 4: \"#ASSSS #\", so column 1 is 'A'. Yes. So (4,1) is an apple. So if we go LEFT, then DOWN, we can eat that apple.\n\nSo possible options:\n\n- UP → (2,2) → then RIGHT → (2,3) (apple)\n\n- RIGHT → (3,3) → then UP → (2,3) (apple)\n\n- LEFT → (3,1) → then DOWN → (4,1) (apple)\n\nAll three paths can reach an apple in two steps. But which is the safest? Let's check if any of these paths have potential collisions.\n\nFirst, moving UP to (2,2). Then next move RIGHT to (2,3) (apple). (2,3) is the apple, so that's safe. The body after moving UP would have (3,2) as S. Then, when moving RIGHT to (2,3), the new head is (2,3) (apple), so the body would include (2,2) (now S), (3,2), etc. No collision.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,3). Then next move UP to (2,3) (apple). (2,3) is apple, safe. The body after moving RIGHT would have (3,2) as S. Then, (3,3) becomes H, next move UP to (2,3) (apple). Safe.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,1). Then next move DOWN to (4,1) (apple). (4,1) is apple. The body after moving LEFT would have (3,2) as S. Then, (3,1) is H, moving DOWN to (4,1) (apple). Safe.\n\nSo all three directions are viable. But which one is better? Maybe the one that avoids the body. Let's check the body positions after moving.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's current body is in row 1 (columns 1-5), row 2 (column 5), row 3 (column 5), row4 (columns 2-5). So the right side (columns 5) has a lot of body segments. So moving towards the right (RIGHT direction) might lead to more body segments in that area. For example, (3,5) is S. So if we move RIGHT to (3,3), then next move UP to (2,3) (apple) is okay, but (2,5) is S, so moving further right could be dangerous.\n\nMoving UP to (2,2): (2,5) is S, but (2,2) is left of that. So that's okay.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,1): (3,1) is left, and (4,1) is the apple. The area to the left seems more open (row 5 and 6 are mostly empty). So perhaps moving LEFT is better as it's towards less crowded areas.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if any of the directions would immediately hit the body. For example, if we move UP, (2,2) is safe. If we move RIGHT, (3,3) is safe. If we move LEFT, (3,1) is safe. So all are safe.\n\nAnother thing: the snake is currently moving UP. If we continue UP, the next position is (2,2). Let's check (2,2) in the current board. The current row 2 is \"#  A S #\", so (2,2) is ' ', which is correct. So moving UP is allowed.\n\nBut perhaps the best choice is to go for the closest apple. The apple at (2,3) is one cell above and to the right of the current head (3,2). The apple at (4,1) is one cell below and to the left. Since the current direction is UP, moving UP would take us closer to (2,3). Alternatively, moving LEFT then DOWN would take us to (4,1).\n\nBut since the snake can't reverse direction, moving DOWN is not allowed in the current step (current direction is UP; next direction can't be DOWN). So the apple at (4,1) is in row 4, which is below the current head (row 3). To reach it, the snake would need to move DOWN, but that's a reverse direction. So the earliest the snake can move DOWN is after changing direction to something else first (like LEFT, then DOWN).\n\nSo in the current step, the possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. All are safe. Let's pick the direction that leads to an apple in the next step. Let's see:\n\nIf we choose UP, next head is (2,2). The adjacent cell to the right (2,3) is an apple. So in the next move, if we turn RIGHT, we can eat it.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT, next head is (3,3). The adjacent cell above (2,3) is an apple. So next move UP would eat it.\n\nIf we choose LEFT, next head is (3,1). The adjacent cell below (4,1) is an apple. Next move DOWN would eat it.\n\nAll three options are good, but perhaps the apple at (2,3) is more accessible. Let's check if (2,3) is reachable without hitting the body. For example, if we move UP to (2,2), then RIGHT to (2,3). (2,3) is apple, and (2,3) is not a body part (current body in row 2 is (2,5) only). So yes, that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,3) then UP to (2,3). (3,3) is safe, (2,3) is apple.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best choice is to move RIGHT. Let's see why. Current head is (3,2). Moving RIGHT to (3,3) (column 3). Then, moving UP to (2,3) (apple). That's a direct path. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,2) then RIGHT to (2,3). Either way.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT. Let's think about the snake's body structure. The current body in row 4 is columns 2-5 (SSSS). So (4,2) is S. The head was previously at (4,2), then moved up to (3,2). So the body is following. If we move LEFT to (3,1), then the next move DOWN to (4,1) (apple) would be good. (4,1) is A, so eating it would grow the snake. That's a valid path.\n\nI think all three directions are safe, but perhaps the best is to choose the direction that leads to an apple in the next step. Since all three can do that, but maybe the apple at (2,3) is closer. Let's go with UP. Wait, but moving UP now to (2,2) is safe, then next step RIGHT to (2,3) (apple). So that's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is RIGHT. Let me double-check. Let's imagine the movement:\n\nCurrent head (3,2), direction UP. If we choose RIGHT, new direction is RIGHT. Head moves to (3,3). The cell (3,3) is ' ', safe. Then, next direction can be UP (since current direction is RIGHT, UP is allowed). So head moves from (3,3) to (2,3), which is the apple. Eating it would be good.\n\nYes, that's a valid path. So choosing RIGHT now allows us to reach the apple in the next step. That's a good move.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP now, then RIGHT next step. Either way. But perhaps the best choice is RIGHT. Let's decide on RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#  A S #\n# H  S #\n#ASSSS #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head ('H') is at (row 3, column 2), moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid), leaving UP, LEFT, or RIGHT as options.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (row 2, column 3), (row 4, column 1), and (row 6, column 3).\n2. **Safety Check**: All three possible directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) lead to empty cells (no walls or self-collisions).\n3. **Path to Apples**:\n   - **UP**: Moves head to (row 2, column 2). From here, a subsequent RIGHT move would reach the apple at (row 2, column 3).\n   - **LEFT**: Moves head to (row 3, column 1). From here, a subsequent DOWN move would reach the apple at (row 4, column 1).\n   - **RIGHT**: Moves head to (row 3, column 3). From here, a subsequent UP move would reach the apple at (row 2, column 3).\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving RIGHT is strategically better. It positions the head at (row 3, column 3), adjacent to the apple at (row 2, column 3). A subsequent UP move will directly reach this apple, allowing the snake to eat it safely and grow. This path avoids crowded body segments on the right and ensures progress toward an apple in the next step.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by parsing the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # SSSS # (so positions (1,1) is 'S', (1,2) 'S', (1,3) 'S', (1,4) 'S')\nRow 2: #  A S # (positions (2,2) 'A', (2,4) 'S')\nRow 3: # SH S # (positions (3,2) 'S', (3,3) 'H' (head), (3,4) 'S')\nRow 4: #ASSSS # (positions (4,1) 'A', (4,2) 'S', (4,3) 'S', (4,4) 'S', (4,5) 'S')\nRow 5: #      # (empty)\nRow 6: #   A  # (position (6,3) 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at (3,3). The current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is moving to the right (east). The snake can't reverse direction, so from RIGHT, the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since reversing would be LEFT, which is not allowed).\n\nLet's confirm the snake's body positions. The head is at (3,3). Let's track the body segments. Let's list all 'S' and 'H' positions:\n\nFrom row 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) → S's\nRow 2: (2,4) → S\nRow 3: (3,2) → S, (3,3) → H, (3,4) → S\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) → S's (and (4,1) is A, but that's an apple)\n\nSo the snake's body is a bit complex. Let's try to reconstruct the snake's path. Since the snake moves in the current direction (RIGHT), the next head position would be (3,4) if moving RIGHT. But wait, (3,4) is currently 'S' (from row 3: # SH S # → positions 3,3 is H, 3,4 is S). So if the snake moves RIGHT (current direction), the head would move to (3,4), which is a body segment. That's a collision with itself, so that's a game over. So moving RIGHT is bad.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The possible directions the player can choose are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse). Let's check each possible direction.\n\nPossible directions to choose: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nFirst, check moving RIGHT: next head position (3,3) + RIGHT → (3,4). What's (3,4) now? It's 'S' (from row 3: the cell is 'S'). So the head would collide with the body. That's a loss. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nNext, check moving UP. The current direction is RIGHT. Moving UP is allowed (since it's not reverse). The next head position would be (3,3) + UP → (2,3). Let's check (2,3) on the board. Row 2 is #  A S # → columns 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is A, 3 is space, 4 is S, 5 is #. So (2,3) is a space (empty). So moving UP would take the head to (2,3). Is that a valid position (not wall, not body)?\n\nCheck if (2,3) is a wall: no, the walls are the first and last columns (0 and 5 for row 2, since row 2 is \"#  A S #\", so columns 0 is #, 5 is #). So (2,3) is within the play area (columns 1-4). The cell (2,3) is empty (space). So moving UP here would be safe. Now, does this cell have an apple? Let's see: row 2, column 3 is space, so no apple. So the snake would move, the body would follow. The tail would move (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so length remains the same). So the new head is (2,3), and the rest of the body shifts.\n\nThird option: moving DOWN. Current direction is RIGHT, so moving DOWN is allowed. The next head position would be (3,3) + DOWN → (4,3). Let's check (4,3) on the board. Row 4 is #ASSSS #. Columns 0 is #, 1 is A, 2 is S, 3 is S, 4 is S, 5 is S, 6 is #? Wait, wait. Let's clarify the columns. Each row is 8 characters (since the board is 8x8). Let's index columns 0 to 7.\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7 are #)\nRow 1: # SSSS # → columns 0 is #, 1 is ' ', 2 is 'S', 3 is 'S', 4 is 'S', 5 is 'S', 6 is ' ', 7 is #? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's correctly parse each row as 8 characters. Let's list each row with columns 0-7:\n\nRow 0: 0: #, 1: #, 2: #, 3: #, 4: #, 5: #, 6: #, 7: # (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSS # → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 2: #  A S # → 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: #? Wait, no. Let's check again. The input given for the game board is:\n\n########\n# SSSS #\n#  A S #\n# SH S #\n#ASSSS #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nEach line is 8 characters. Let's check each row's length. The first line is 8 #, correct. The second line is \"# SSSS #\" → let's count the characters: # (1), space (1), S (1), S (1), S (1), S (1), space (1), # (1). That's 8. So columns 0-7 for row 1 are: 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: #.\n\nRow 2: \"#  A S #\" → 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: #. That's 8.\n\nRow 3: \"# SH S #\" → 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'H', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: #. So the head (H) is at (3,3) (row 3, column 3).\n\nRow 4: \"#ASSSS #\" → 0: #, 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: #.\n\nRow 5: \"#      #\" → 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #.\n\nRow 6: \"#   A  #\" → 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #.\n\nRow 7: ######## (all #).\n\nOkay, that's a better parsing. So the head (H) is at (row 3, column 3). Current direction is RIGHT, so moving RIGHT would take the head to (3,4). Let's check (3,4): in row 3, column 4 is ' ' (since row 3 is \"# SH S #\", so columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'H', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (3,4) is a space. Oh, I made a mistake earlier! I thought (3,4) was S, but no. Let's recheck row 3: \"# SH S #\". Breaking it down:\n\n- Column 0: #\n- Column 1: ' '\n- Column 2: 'S'\n- Column 3: 'H'\n- Column 4: ' '\n- Column 5: 'S'\n- Column 6: ' '\n- Column 7: #\n\nSo (3,4) is a space. So moving RIGHT (current direction) would take the head to (3,4). Is that a valid position? Let's check for walls or body.\n\nThe cell (3,4) is a space (no wall, no S, no H). So moving RIGHT is possible. Then, what's in that cell? It's empty, so the snake doesn't eat an apple. So the snake moves, the body follows. The tail (the last segment) would be removed since the snake didn't grow.\n\nNow, possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse of RIGHT, which is not allowed). Let's check each direction's next position.\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT. Possible directions to turn: UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n\n1. RIGHT direction: next head position (3,3) + RIGHT → (3,4). What's in (3,4)? ' ' (empty). So valid. No collision. So that's safe.\n\n2. UP direction: next head position (3,3) - 1 row (since UP is row-1) → (2,3). Let's check (2,3). Row 2, column 3: 'A' (since row 2 is \"#  A S #\", column 3 is 'A'). Oh! So (2,3) is an apple. So if the snake moves UP, the head goes to (2,3), which has an 'A'. So the snake eats the apple, grows in length, score increases by 1. That's a good move.\n\nWait, let's confirm row 2, column 3. Row 2 is \"#  A S #\". Let's list each column:\n\nRow 2: columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (2,3) is 'A' (apple). So moving UP would take the head to (2,3), which is an apple. That's a good move because eating the apple increases the score and the snake grows. So that's a better option.\n\n3. DOWN direction: next head position (3,3) + 1 row → (4,3). Check (4,3). Row 4 is \"#ASSSS #\". Columns 0: #, 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (4,3) is 'S' (body segment). So moving DOWN would make the head collide with the body. That's a game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions:\n\n- RIGHT: moves to (3,4) (safe, no apple)\n- UP: moves to (2,3) (apple, safe)\n- DOWN: collision (invalid)\n\nSo the best option is UP, since it allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score and growing. Let's confirm again.\n\nHead is at (3,3). Moving UP (row-1, column same) → (2,3). That cell has 'A' (apple). So the snake eats it, grows. The new head is (2,3). The body will extend, since the snake grows. The previous positions of the body will shift, but since it's eating an apple, the tail doesn't get removed. So that's a valid and beneficial move.\n\nSo the answer should be UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSS #\n#  A S #\n# SH S #\n#ASSSS #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 3) (row 3, column 3), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). We need to evaluate possible directions: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n1. **RIGHT Direction**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3, 4). This cell is empty (no wall, no body), so it is safe but does not contain an apple. The snake would not grow, and the score remains unchanged.\n\n2. **UP Direction**: Moving UP would take the head to (2, 3). This cell contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is beneficial as it increases the score by 1 and allows the snake to grow. The cell (2, 3) is within the play area (not a wall) and does not collide with the snake's body, making this move safe and advantageous.\n\n3. **DOWN Direction**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (4, 3). This cell contains a body segment ('S'), causing a self-collision. This would end the game, so DOWN is invalid.\n\nThe best move is UP, as it allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and avoid collisions.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's state. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n# SSSS #\n#  H S #\n# SS S #\n#ASSSSA#\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the epoch is 25. The snake can't reverse direction, so from UP, the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP (since reversing would be DOWN, which is not allowed).\n\nFirst, let's locate the snake's head (H). Looking at the board, the second row (row 1 if we start counting from 0) is \"# SSSS #\". Then row 2 is \"#  H S #\". So H is at row 2, column 3 (assuming columns are 0-based from left to right). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7)\nRow 1: # SSSS # → columns 1-6. So positions (1,1)=S, (1,2)=S, (1,3)=S, (1,4)=S\nRow 2: #  H S # → columns 1-6. So (2,1)=space, (2,2)=space, (2,3)=H, (2,4)=S, (2,5)=space\nRow 3: # SS S # → (3,1)=S, (3,2)=S, (3,3)=space, (3,4)=S\nRow 4: #ASSSSA# → (4,1)=A, (4,2)=S, (4,3)=S, (4,4)=S, (4,5)=A\nRow 5: #      # → all spaces in columns 1-6\nRow 6: #   A  # → (6,3)=A\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo the head (H) is at (2,3). The current direction is UP, so the next move (if direction remains UP) would be to (1,3). Let's check that position. Row 1, column 3: from row 1's string \"# SSSS #\", column 3 is S (since SSSS are in columns 1-4). So (1,3) is part of the snake's body. If the snake moves UP, the head would collide with its own body, which ends the game. So moving UP is bad.\n\nNext, possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (but wait, current direction is UP. The rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. So reversing from UP is DOWN. So can't go DOWN. So possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT. Because the current direction is UP, the snake can turn to LEFT or RIGHT, but not DOWN (reverse).\n\nLet's check moving LEFT. The head is at (2,3). Moving LEFT would take it to (2,2). Let's check (2,2) on the board. Row 2 is \"#  H S #\", so column 2 is a space (since the row is [ #,  ,  , H, S,  , # ]). So (2,2) is empty (a space). So that's safe. What's there? Just a space. No collision with walls (since walls are the edges, and 2,2 is within 1-6 columns and 1-6 rows). So moving LEFT would be to (2,2). Then, the snake's body would follow. Since the snake is moving, the tail would move if it didn't eat an apple. Let's check if moving LEFT would hit an apple. The current head is at (2,3). The new position (2,2) is a space, so no apple. So the snake would move, the head goes to (2,2), and the tail (since no apple was eaten) would remove the last segment.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT. The head is at (2,3). Moving RIGHT would take it to (2,4). Let's check (2,4) on row 2: \"#  H S #\", column 4 is S. So (2,4) is part of the snake's body. So moving RIGHT would cause a collision with the body, ending the game. So RIGHT is bad.\n\nSo the only possible safe directions are LEFT. Let's confirm again. Current direction is UP. Can't go DOWN (reverse). UP leads to (1,3), which is S (body). RIGHT leads to (2,4) which is S (body). LEFT leads to (2,2), which is empty. So the only safe direction is LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# SSSS #\n#  H S #\n# SS S #\n#ASSSSA#\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (2,3) (row 2, column 3, 0-indexed). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. We need to check possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (1,3). Checking row 1, column 3: the cell is 'S' (part of the snake's body). Colliding with the body ends the game. **Invalid**.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,4). Checking row 2, column 4: the cell is 'S' (part of the snake's body). Colliding with the body ends the game. **Invalid**.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (2,2). Checking row 2, column 2: the cell is empty (space). No collision with walls or the snake's body. **Safe**.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls (marked with #). Let's list out each row to get a clear picture:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  SSS # → positions (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) are S (body)\nRow 2: # HS S # → Let's check each position. (2,1) is space, (2,2) is H (head), (2,3) is S, (2,4) is space, (2,5) is S, (2,6) is space. So H is at (2,2).\nRow 3: # SS S # → (3,1) space, (3,2) S, (3,3) S, (3,4) space, (3,5) S, (3,6) space.\nRow 4: #ASSSSA# → (4,1) A, (4,2) S, (4,3) S, (4,4) S, (4,5) S, (4,6) A.\nRow 5: #      # → all spaces except walls.\nRow 6: #   A  # → (6,3) is A.\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. The snake can't reverse direction, so if current direction is LEFT, the snake can't immediately turn RIGHT. The possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed).\n\nFirst, let's find the head position. From row 2, H is at (2,2). The current direction is LEFT, so the next position if moving LEFT would be (2,1). Let's check what's there. Looking at row 2: \"# HS S #\", so (2,1) is a space (since the characters are [0]#, [1] space, [2]H, [3]S, etc. So (2,1) is (row 2, column 1) which is a space. So if the snake moves LEFT, the head would go to (2,1). Then, we need to check if that's a collision. (2,1) is a space, not a wall (since row 2's first and last are #, columns 0 and 7 are walls). So (2,1) is safe. But wait, also check if the new head position is part of the snake's body. The body parts are all the S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\nRow 2: (2,3), (2,5)\nRow 3: (2,2) is H, so row 3: (3,2), (3,3), (3,5)\nRow 4: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nSo (2,1) is a space, not a body part. So moving LEFT would be safe. But are there any apples in that direction? Let's check. The apples are at (4,1), (4,6), (6,3). So (2,1) is a space, not an apple. So moving LEFT would just move the head there, and the body would follow (since the snake's length is such that when moving, the tail would move if no apple is eaten).\n\nBut maybe there's a better direction. Let's check possible directions:\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. Possible next directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (since RIGHT is reverse and not allowed).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT: Next head position is (2,1). Check if that's a wall? Columns 0 is a wall (row 2, column 0 is #). (2,1) is column 1, which is within 0-7 (columns 0-7, walls at 0 and 7). So (2,1) is safe (not a wall). Check if (2,1) is body: as above, no. So safe. No apple here, so snake moves, tail moves (length remains same).\n\n2. UP: Current head is (2,2). Moving UP would go to (1,2). Let's check (1,2): in row 1, the string is \"#  SSS #\". So columns 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is S. So (1,2) is S (body part). So moving UP would cause the head to hit the body. That's a collision, game over. So UP is invalid.\n\n3. DOWN: Current head is (2,2). Moving DOWN would go to (3,2). Let's check (3,2). Row 3 is \"# SS S #\". Columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: S. So (3,2) is S (body). So moving DOWN would hit the body. Collision, game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\n4. RIGHT: Not allowed because current direction is LEFT, reversing is not allowed. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo the only possible direction that's safe is LEFT. Because UP and DOWN would hit the body, and RIGHT is reverse. So the snake must move LEFT to avoid collision.\n\n\n########\n#  SSS #\n# HS S #\n# SS S #\n#ASSSSA#\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's current head position is at (row 2, column 2). The current direction is LEFT, so the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. Let's analyze possible directions:\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 1, column 2). Checking row 1: \"#  SSS #\", (1,2) is an 'S' (body part). Collision with self. Invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 3, column 2). Checking row 3: \"# SS S #\", (3,2) is an 'S' (body part). Collision with self. Invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Reversing direction from LEFT to RIGHT is not allowed. Invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 2, column 1). Checking row 2: \"# HS S #\", (2,1) is a space (safe, no wall or body collision). This is the only valid direction.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #   SS # (so positions 3 and 4 are 'S', others are space except the walls at 0 and 7)\nRow 2: #HSS S # (H is at position 1, then S at 2, 3, then space, then S at 5)\nRow 3: # SS S # (S at 2, 3, space, then S at 5)\nRow 4: #ASSSSA# (A at 1, S at 2,3,4,5, A at 6)\nRow 5: #      # (all spaces except walls)\nRow 6: #   A  # (A at position 4)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, and the snake is moving left. The snake's head is 'H' in row 2, column 1. Let's confirm the head's position. Row 2 is \"#HSS S #\", so the H is at column 1 (since index starts at 0). So head is (2,1).\n\nThe snake's body is made of 'S's. Let's track the body segments. Since the direction is LEFT, the next move would be to (2,0) if we keep moving LEFT. But wait, (2,0) is a wall (since row 2 starts with # at column 0). So moving LEFT would make the head hit the wall, which is a collision. That's bad because the game ends if it hits the wall.\n\nSo the current direction is LEFT, but moving left next step would hit the wall. So we need to change direction, but can't reverse. The snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is LEFT, reversing would be RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT? Wait, no. The rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. Reversing means if current direction is LEFT, you can't turn to RIGHT (because that's the opposite). So allowed directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. But moving LEFT is into the wall, which is a collision. So we need to choose between UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check where the head would go if we change direction to UP or DOWN.\n\nCurrent head position is (row 2, column 1). Let's note the coordinates as (row, column), with row 0 at top.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The next position if moving LEFT would be (2, 0). But (2,0) is a wall (since all rows start and end with #), so that's a collision. So moving LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT? Wait, no. The snake's movement direction can be changed to any direction except the reverse. Since current direction is LEFT, the reverse is RIGHT. So the snake can't turn directly to RIGHT. So allowed directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. But LEFT is a wall, so we have to choose between UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check UP first. If direction is UP, the head would move to (1, 1). Let's check what's in (1,1). Row 1 is \"#   SS #\", so columns 0 is #, 1 is space (since the row is \"#   SS #\", which is positions 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #). So (1,1) is a space. That's safe.\n\nNow check if (1,1) is part of the snake's body. The body segments are 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1: columns 3,4 (so (1,3), (1,4))\nRow 2: columns 2,3,5 (so (2,2), (2,3), (2,5))\nRow 3: columns 2,3,5 (so (3,2), (3,3), (3,5))\nRow 4: columns 2,3,4,5 (so (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5))\n\nSo (1,1) is a space, not a body part. So moving UP to (1,1) is safe.\n\nNow check direction DOWN. If direction is DOWN, the head moves to (3,1). Let's check (3,1). Row 3 is \"# SS S #\". Columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (3,1) is a space. Is that part of the body? Looking at the 'S's in row 3: (3,2), (3,3), (3,5). So (3,1) is a space. So moving DOWN to (3,1) is also safe.\n\nNow, we need to check if there are apples nearby. The goal is to eat apples. Let's list all 'A's on the board.\n\nRow 4: column 1 (A) and column 6 (A) (row 4: \"#ASSSSA#\" → (4,1) and (4,6) are A)\nRow 6: column 4 (A) (row 6: \"#   A  #\" → (6,4) is A)\n\nSo apples are at (4,1), (4,6), (6,4).\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,1). Let's see possible paths.\n\nIf we move UP to (1,1), then next possible moves. The direction would now be UP. Let's see the path towards apples. (4,1) is in row 4, column 1. The head is moving up, so (1,1) → next step would be (0,1), which is a wall (row 0 is ########). So moving UP would lead to a wall next step. So that's a problem. So after moving UP once, next direction can't be UP again (since it's a wall), but possible directions would be LEFT (invalid), RIGHT (reverse of UP's previous direction?), wait no. The direction after moving UP would be UP. So the next move would be to (0,1), which is a wall. So that's a collision. So moving UP now might not be good because the next step would hit the wall.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (3,1), then the direction becomes DOWN. Next possible move would be (4,1). Let's check (4,1). Oh! (4,1) is an apple (A). So if we move DOWN, then next step (if we keep direction DOWN) would take the head to (4,1), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple would increase the score and the snake grows. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head is (2,1). If direction is DOWN, the next position is (3,1). That's safe (no collision). Then, if we continue moving DOWN (since direction is now DOWN), the next position would be (4,1), which is the A. So moving DOWN now would set up the next move to eat the apple. That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if we move DOWN to (3,1), the next step (epoch 28) would have the head at (3,1). Then, in epoch 29, moving DOWN again would take the head to (4,1), which is the A. So that's a way to eat the apple.\n\nSo the best direction here is DOWN. Because moving LEFT would hit the wall, moving UP would lead to a wall next step, but moving DOWN leads towards an apple. Also, moving DOWN now is safe (no collision with body or wall), and sets up for eating an apple next.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   SS #\n#HSS S #\n# SS S #\n#ASSSSA#\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 2, column 1), and the current direction is LEFT. Moving LEFT would take the head to (2, 0), which is a wall (collision). The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). The remaining options are UP or DOWN. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (1, 1), which is a safe space (no collision with walls or body). However, the next move in the UP direction would reach (0, 1), a wall, leading to collision.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (3, 1), a safe space. The next move in the DOWN direction would reach (4, 1), which contains an apple ('A'), allowing the snake to eat it and grow.  \n\nThus, moving DOWN is the optimal choice to avoid immediate collision and set up for eating an apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #    S # (columns 0 is #, 1-3 are spaces, 4 is S, 5 is space, 6 is #)\nRow 2: #SSS S # (columns 0 is #, 1-3 are S, 4 is space, 5 is S, 6 is #)\nRow 3: #HSS S # (columns 0 is #, 1 is H, 2-3 are S, 4 is space, 5 is S, 6 is #)\nRow 4: #ASSSSA# (columns 0 is #, 1 is A, 2-4 are S, 5 is S, 6 is A, 7 is #)\nRow 5: #      # (all spaces except walls)\nRow 6: #   A  # (columns 0 is #, 1-2 spaces, 3 is A, 4-5 spaces, 6 is #)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe snake's head is 'H' at row 3, column 1. The current direction is DOWN. So the snake is moving down. Let's check where the head will move next if we continue in the current direction (DOWN) or change direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP). But remember, the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is DOWN, so the opposite direction is UP. So we can't choose UP as the next direction. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n\nFirst, let's find the next position of the head for each possible direction:\n\nCurrent head position (H) is at (row, column) (3,1). Let's use (row, col) where row 0 is top.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, so moving down would take the head to row 4, column 1. Let's check that position. Looking at row 4, column 1: the cell is 'A' (from row 4: #ASSSSA# → column 1 is A). So if we move DOWN, the head moves to (4,1), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple will grow the snake. But we need to check if that cell is safe (not a wall or snake body). The cell (4,1) is A, which is not a wall or S, so it's safe. So moving DOWN would eat the apple, increase the score, and the snake would grow. The new head would be at (4,1), and the body would follow. \n\nWhat about other directions? Let's check LEFT. The current direction is DOWN, so LEFT is allowed (since it's not the opposite). Moving LEFT from (3,1) would take the head to (3,0). But (3,0) is a wall (since row 3 starts with #, column 0 is #). So moving LEFT would hit the wall, causing a collision. That's a loss. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nNext, RIGHT direction. The head is at (3,1). Moving RIGHT would take it to (3,2). Let's check (3,2): in row 3, the string is #HSS S # → column 2 is 'S'. So (3,2) is part of the snake's body. If the head moves there, it's a self-collision, which ends the game. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nWhat about UP? The current direction is DOWN, so UP is the reverse direction. The snake can't reverse direction. So UP is not allowed. So the only possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, but LEFT is wall, RIGHT is body, so only DOWN is valid.\n\nSo the best direction is DOWN, which allows the snake to eat the apple at (4,1) and grow, avoiding collision.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    S #\n#SSS S #\n#HSS S #\n#ASSSSA#\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the snake's possible moves from its current head position (row 3, column 1) with the current direction DOWN (cannot reverse to UP). \n\n1. **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (3, 0), which is a wall (`#`). This causes a wall collision, ending the game. Invalid.  \n2. **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (3, 2), which is occupied by the snake's body (`S`). This causes a self-collision, ending the game. Invalid.  \n3. **Moving DOWN**: The head moves to (4, 1), which contains an apple (`A`). This is safe (no collision), and eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake. Valid.  \n\nThe only safe and valid direction is DOWN. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board.\n\nThe board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #  A S # → So positions (1,2) is A, (1,5) is S.\nRow 2: #SSS S # → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) are S; (2,5) is S.\nRow 3: #SSS S # → (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are S; (3,5) is S.\nRow 4: #HSSSSA# → (4,1) is H (head), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are S; (4,6) is A.\nRow 5: #      # → all empty except walls.\nRow 6: #   A  # → (6,3) is A.\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, and the snake is moving down. The snake's head is at (4,1). Since the direction is DOWN, the next position the head would move to is (5,1) (since moving down from row 4 to row 5, same column 1).\n\nNow, let's check possible directions. The snake can't reverse direction, so since current direction is DOWN, the snake can't go UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Current direction is DOWN. If we choose DOWN again, the head moves to (5,1). Let's check if that's a valid position. Row 5, column 1: looking at row 5, it's #      #, so (5,1) is empty (since the row is 0-based, columns 0 and 7 are walls, so positions (5,1) to (5,6) are empty). So (5,1) is safe. Is there an apple there? No. So the snake moves there, and since no apple, the tail (the last S) would move. The snake's body is from (4,1) (head) followed by (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and then in rows 3, 2, 1: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3); (2,1), (2,2), (2,3); (2,5), (3,5), (1,5). So the tail is probably the last S. When moving down, the head moves to (5,1), and the body follows. So the new head is (5,1), then (4,1) becomes S, and the tail (the end of the body) would be removed. But in this case, since no apple is eaten, the length stays the same, so the tail moves.\n\n2. Direction LEFT: The snake is moving DOWN, so can it turn LEFT? Yes, because LEFT is not the reverse (reverse of DOWN is UP). So moving LEFT would mean the head moves to (4,0). But (4,0) is a wall (since row 4 starts with #), so that's a collision. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT: The head would move to (4,2). But (4,2) is S (body of the snake). So that's a collision with itself. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\n4. Direction UP: Reverse direction, which is not allowed. So UP is invalid.\n\nSo the only possible direction is DOWN. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head is (4,1). Moving DOWN (current direction) → (5,1). Check (5,1) in row 5: row 5 is #      # → (5,1) is a space (not a wall, not S, not A). So it's safe. So the snake can move there.\n\nWait, but let's double-check the positions. Let's list all S positions. The head is at (4,1). The body includes:\n\nRow 4: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) → S's.\n\nRow 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,5) → S's.\n\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5) → S's.\n\nRow 1: (1,5) → S.\n\nSo the snake's body is a long chain. The head is at (4,1). The next positions in the body are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)? Wait, maybe I need to track the snake's body order. Because the snake moves, the body segments follow the head. Let's think about how the snake is arranged.\n\nThe snake's movement direction was DOWN, so the head was moving down. Let's reconstruct the snake's path. Suppose the head was at (3,1) in the previous step (since current head is (4,1), moving down from (3,1) to (4,1)). Then the body would be (3,1) (previous head) becomes S, and the rest of the body follows. So the body segments are:\n\nHead at (4,1) → previous head (3,1) → then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) → but wait, in row 3, the row is #SSS S # → (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are S, (3,5) is S. So (3,4) is empty. So maybe the snake's body is arranged as:\n\nHead (4,1) → (4,2) → (4,3) → (4,4) → (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (3,3) → (3,2) → (3,1) → (2,3) → (2,2) → (2,1). That's a bit complicated, but the key is that when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows the one in front.\n\nBut regardless, the next position if moving down is (5,1). Let's check if (5,1) is part of the snake's body. The current body positions are all the S's in the board. (5,1) is in row 5, which is #      #, so (5,1) is a space (not S). So it's safe.\n\nSo the only possible direction is DOWN. Because LEFT would hit the wall (column 0), RIGHT would hit (4,2) which is S (body), UP is reverse direction. So the answer must be DOWN.\n\n\n########\n#  A S #\n#SSS S #\n#SSS S #\n#HSSSSA#\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at (4,1) (row 4, column 1). The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid). Let's evaluate possible directions:\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (4,1) would take the head to (4,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall). Collision with the wall, invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (4,1) would take the head to (4,2), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). Collision with self, invalid.\n- **UP**: Reverse of the current direction (DOWN), which is not allowed. Invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (4,1) takes the head to (5,1). Row 5, column 1 is empty (no wall, no snake body, no apple). This is a valid move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #  A   # (positions 2 has an 'A')\nRow 2: #SSS S # (positions 2,3,4 are 'S'; position 6 is 'S')\nRow 3: #SSS S # (positions 2,3,4 are 'S'; position 6 is 'S')\nRow 4: #SSSSSA# (positions 2,3,4,5,6 are 'S'; position 7 is 'A')\nRow 5: #H     # (position 2 is 'H'; the rest are spaces)\nRow 6: #   A  # (position 4 is 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe snake's head is at row 5, column 2 (since row 5 is \"#H     #\", so index 1 is '#', 2 is 'H'). The current direction is DOWN. The snake can't reverse direction, so from DOWN, the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (but wait, the problem says the player provides direction inputs, but the snake can't reverse. So if current direction is DOWN, the next direction can't be UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Because reversing is not allowed. So the player can choose between LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\nNow, the snake is moving one square at a time. Let's track where the head will move next based on each possible direction.\n\nFirst, current head position (H) is at (row 5, column 2). Let's note coordinates as (row, column), with row 0 at top.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So if the direction input is DOWN, the next head position would be row 5 + 1 (since moving down increases the row number) → row 6, column 2. Let's check that position. Row 6 is \"#   A  #\", so column 2 is a space (since row 6: index 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is ' ', 4 is 'A', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'). So (6,2) is a space. Then, after moving, the snake's body will follow. But since the snake's length depends on how many apples it's eaten. Let's think about the snake's current body.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 2: #SSS S # → columns 2,3,4 (positions 2,3,4) are S; column 6 is S. So positions (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,6)\nRow 3: #SSS S # → (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6)\nRow 4: #SSSSSA# → (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) (since up to column 6 is S, then column 7 is A)\nRow 5: #H     # → (5,2) is H.\n\nSo the snake's body parts (S) are in these positions. Let's list all S positions:\n\n(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,6),\n(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6),\n(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6),\nand H is (5,2).\n\nSo the snake's current length: H is 1, plus all the S's. Let's count the S's. Let's count:\n\nRow 2 has 4 S's (columns 2,3,4,6)\nRow 3 has 4 S's (columns 2,3,4,6)\nRow 4 has 5 S's (columns 2,3,4,5,6)\nTotal S's: 4+4+5=13. So total length is 1 (H) +13 (S) =14. So when moving, the tail (the last S) would move if no apple is eaten. But when the head moves into an apple, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move (so the length increases by 1).\n\nNow, let's check possible directions:\n\nOption 1: Direction DOWN. Next head position (5+1, 2) = (6,2). What's at (6,2)? The row 6 is \"#   A  #\", so column 2 is ' ' (space). So moving here is safe (not a wall, not a body part). Then, the snake moves. The head moves to (6,2), and the body follows. The previous head (5,2) becomes S, and the tail (the oldest S) is removed. But since the snake didn't eat an apple, the length remains the same. So the tail would move. But in this case, the move is safe.\n\nOption 2: Direction LEFT. The head is at (5,2). Moving left would take it to (5,1). Let's check (5,1). The row 5 is \"#H     #\", so column 1 is '#' (since the first character is '#', then column 0 is '#', column 1 is the next, which is part of the wall). Wait, row 5 is \"#H     #\". Let's index the columns from 0 to 7. So:\n\nRow 5: index 0 is '#', 1 is 'H'? Wait, no. Wait, the row is written as \"#H     #\". Let's count the characters. Each row is 8 characters (since the board is 8x8). So \"#H     #\" is 8 characters:\n\nIndex 0: '#'\nIndex 1: 'H'? Wait, no. Let's see: \"#H     #\" → that's 1 (for the first #) + 1 (H) + 5 (spaces) + 1 (last #) → 8. So indexes 0 is '#', 1 is 'H', 2-6 are ' ', 7 is '#'. Oh! Oh right, I made a mistake earlier. Let's correct the head position. \n\nOriginal row 5: \"#H     #\". So the H is at column 1 (since indexes 0: '#', 1: 'H', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'). So H is at (5,1), not (5,2). Oh, that's a critical error. Let's re-express all positions correctly.\n\nLet's re-express each row properly, with columns 0-7:\n\nRow 0: ######## → columns 0-7: all '#'\nRow 1: #  A   # → columns 0='#', 1=' ', 2=' ', 3='A', 4=' ', 5=' ', 6=' ', 7='#'\nRow 2: #SSS S # → columns 0='#', 1='S', 2='S', 3='S', 4=' ', 5='S', 6=' ', 7='#'\nRow 3: #SSS S # → columns 0='#', 1='S', 2='S', 3='S', 4=' ', 5='S', 6=' ', 7='#'\nRow 4: #SSSSSA# → columns 0='#', 1='S', 2='S', 3='S', 4='S', 5='S', 6='A', 7='#'\nRow 5: #H     # → columns 0='#', 1='H', 2=' ', 3=' ', 4=' ', 5=' ', 6=' ', 7='#'\nRow 6: #   A  # → columns 0='#', 1=' ', 2=' ', 3=' ', 4='A', 5=' ', 6=' ', 7='#'\nRow 7: ######## → columns 0-7: all '#'\n\nAh, that's a big correction. So H is at (5,1). Let's redo all positions:\n\nH (head) is at (row 5, column 1).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So moving down would take the head to row 5+1=6, column 1. Let's check (6,1): row 6 is \"#   A  #\", so column 1 is ' ' (since row 6 columns 0='#', 1=' ', 2=' ', 3=' ', 4='A', 5=' ', 6=' ', 7='#'). So (6,1) is a space. That's safe.\n\nNow, let's list all S positions (body):\n\nRow 2: columns 1,2,3,5 → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5)\nRow 3: columns 1,2,3,5 → (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,5)\nRow 4: columns 1,2,3,4,5 → (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\nSo all S positions are these coordinates.\n\nNow, possible directions: current direction is DOWN. So the snake can't reverse to UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nLet's check each direction:\n\n1. Direction DOWN: next head position (5+1,1) = (6,1). Check if that's a wall or body. (6,1) is ' ' (safe). No collision. So this is a valid move.\n\n2. Direction LEFT: next head position (5,1-1) = (5,0). Column 0 is a wall (row 5, column 0 is '#'), so collision with wall. Game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT: next head position (5,1+1) = (5,2). Check (5,2): row 5, column 2 is ' ' (safe). So moving RIGHT would take head to (5,2), which is a space. No collision. Valid.\n\nNow, are there any apples in the possible next positions? Let's check.\n\nCurrent apples are at:\n\nRow 1, column 3: (1,3) → 'A'\nRow 4, column 6: (4,6) → 'A' (from row 4: #SSSSSA# → column 6 is 'A')\nRow 6, column 4: (6,4) → 'A' (row 6: #   A  # → column 4 is 'A')\n\nSo the next head positions for each direction:\n\n- DOWN: (6,1) → no apple.\n- RIGHT: (5,2) → no apple.\n- LEFT: (5,0) → wall (invalid).\n\nSo none of the next positions have apples, so the snake won't grow. But the goal is to eat apples, so we need to choose a direction that leads towards an apple without collision.\n\nLet's see the snake's current path. The snake is at (5,1), moving down. Let's think about where the apples are. The apples are at (1,3), (4,6), (6,4).\n\nThe head is at (5,1). Let's see the positions:\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (6,1), next possible moves. From (6,1), direction can't be UP (since current direction would be DOWN, so next direction can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN). From (6,1), moving DOWN would go to (7,1), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'), so that's a collision. So moving DOWN again from (6,1) would be bad.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (5,2), then next possible directions (current direction would be RIGHT, so can't go LEFT). So from (5,2), possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLooking for paths to apples. Let's check (6,4) is an apple. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (5,3), then RIGHT to (5,4), etc. Alternatively, moving DOWN from (5,2) to (6,2), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (6,4) (the apple at (6,4)). That's a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (4,6). To reach that, the snake would need to go up. Let's see. Current head is (5,1). To reach (4,6), the snake would need to move up (but current direction is DOWN, so next direction can't be UP unless the next direction is something else first). Let's think.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So the next direction can be LEFT (invalid), RIGHT, or DOWN. Let's say we choose RIGHT. Then the new direction is RIGHT. Then, the next move would be to (5,3). Then, possible directions (can't go LEFT, since current direction is RIGHT). So directions could be UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf after moving RIGHT to (5,2), next direction could be UP. Let's say after moving RIGHT (to (5,2)), the direction is UP. Then head moves to (4,2). Check (4,2): in row 4, column 2 is 'S' (from row 4: #SSSSSA# → columns 1-5 are S, so (4,2) is S). So collision with body. That's bad. So moving UP from (5,2) to (4,2) is a collision.\n\nHmm. Let's check (4,1) is S (row 4, column 1 is S). So (4,1) is part of the body.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT again. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (5,3). Then, (5,3) is ' ' (safe). Then, moving RIGHT to (5,4), then (5,5), then (5,6). (5,6) is ' ' (row 5: \"#H     #\" → column 6 is ' '). Then, moving UP to (4,6) which is the apple. That's a possible path. (4,6) is 'A' (row 4, column 6). So (4,6) is an apple. So if the snake can get there, that's good.\n\nSo from (5,1), moving RIGHT to (5,2), then RIGHT to (5,3), then RIGHT to (5,4), then RIGHT to (5,5), then RIGHT to (5,6), then UP to (4,6) (the apple). Let's check if those positions are safe.\n\n(5,2) is safe (no S). (5,3) is safe. (5,4) is safe. (5,5) is safe (row 5, column 5 is ' '). (5,6) is safe. Then (4,6) is the apple. So that's a possible path. So choosing RIGHT now would start moving towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,1). Then from (6,1), possible directions are RIGHT (since moving DOWN again would hit the wall). So (6,1) → RIGHT to (6,2), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (6,4) (the apple at (6,4)). That's another apple. Let's check that path.\n\n(6,1) is safe. (6,2) is ' ', (6,3) is ' ', (6,4) is 'A'. So moving DOWN to (6,1), then RIGHT to (6,2), RIGHT to (6,3), RIGHT to (6,4) would reach that apple. So that's also a possible path.\n\nSo both directions (RIGHT and DOWN) could lead to apples. Which is better? Let's check if there are any obstacles in these paths.\n\nFor the RIGHT path:\n\n(5,1) → RIGHT → (5,2) (safe). Then, (5,2) → RIGHT → (5,3) (safe). (5,3) → RIGHT → (5,4) (safe). (5,4) → RIGHT → (5,5) (safe). (5,5) → RIGHT → (5,6) (safe). (5,6) → UP → (4,6) (apple). So (4,6) is in row 4, column 6. Let's check row 4: \"#SSSSSA#\". Column 6 is 'A', correct. So (4,6) is the apple. So moving up from (5,6) to (4,6) would be possible if direction is UP. But after moving RIGHT several times, the current direction would be RIGHT, so the next direction can't be LEFT. So when at (5,6), direction could be UP (since current direction is RIGHT, so allowed directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT). So UP is allowed.\n\nFor the DOWN path:\n\n(5,1) → DOWN → (6,1) (safe). (6,1) → RIGHT → (6,2) (safe). (6,2) → RIGHT → (6,3) (safe). (6,3) → RIGHT → (6,4) (apple). So that's 3 moves to reach the apple at (6,4). That's a shorter path. So that's better.\n\nSo moving DOWN now (current direction is DOWN) to (6,1) is safe, and then moving RIGHT towards (6,4) (the apple) would be a good path. So choosing DOWN as the next direction would allow the snake to move towards that apple.\n\nWait, but what about the snake's body? Are there any S's in the path?\n\nFor the DOWN direction, (6,1) is safe (no S). The S's are in rows 2,3,4. So row 6, column 1 is not an S. So that's safe.\n\nSo the possible directions are DOWN and RIGHT. Both are safe. Which one is better?\n\nThe apple at (6,4) is closer if we go DOWN first. Let's see:\n\nIf current direction is DOWN, moving to (6,1) (row 6, column 1). Then, the next direction can be RIGHT (since current direction is DOWN, next direction can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. But DOWN from (6,1) would go to (7,1), which is a wall. So better to go RIGHT. So next direction RIGHT, moving to (6,2). Then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (6,4) (apple). That's 3 steps to reach the apple.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT now, moving to (5,2). Then, next direction could be DOWN (since current direction is RIGHT, so allowed directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT). So (5,2) → DOWN to (6,2). Then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (6,4). That's also 3 steps. So same number of steps.\n\nBut maybe there's another consideration: the snake's body. Let's check if any of the next positions after moving would collide with the body.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (6,1), that's safe. Then, moving RIGHT to (6,2), which is safe (no S's in row 6). Then (6,3), (6,4). All safe.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (5,2), that's safe. Then moving DOWN to (6,2), which is safe, etc. Also safe.\n\nSo both directions are safe. But the problem is to choose the best direction. Since the snake's current direction is DOWN, and the player can choose any direction except the reverse (UP). So both DOWN and RIGHT are possible.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better option. Let's check if moving RIGHT now could lead to a collision in the next steps. For example, (5,2) is safe, then (5,3), (5,4), etc. All those positions are empty. So no problem.\n\nAlternatively, the snake's body is in rows 2,3,4. So rows 5 and 6 are mostly empty except for the head. So moving in either direction is safe.\n\nSince the problem says to eat as many apples as possible, and both directions can lead to apples, perhaps either is acceptable. But perhaps the best choice is to move towards the nearest apple. Let's check the distance to each apple.\n\nThe head is at (5,1). Let's calculate Manhattan distance to each apple:\n\nApple at (1,3): distance is (5-1) + (3-1) = 4 +2=6.\n\nApple at (4,6): (5-4)+(6-1)=1+5=6.\n\nApple at (6,4): (6-5)+(4-1)=1+3=4. So the closest apple is at (6,4) (distance 4).\n\nSo moving towards (6,4) is better. To reach (6,4) from (5,1), the path via DOWN then RIGHT is:\n\n(5,1) → (6,1) (DOWN), then (6,2) (RIGHT), (6,3) (RIGHT), (6,4) (RIGHT). So that's 3 moves. Which is the closest.\n\nSo the best direction is to move DOWN now, then RIGHT, etc. So the next direction should be DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#SSS S #\n#SSS S #\n#SSSSSA#\n#H     #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 5, column 1).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN (snake cannot reverse to UP).\n- **Possible Directions**: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since reversing to UP is invalid).\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,3), (4,6), and (6,4). The closest apple is at (6,4) (Manhattan distance of 4 from the head).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (5,0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes an immediate collision. **Invalid**.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (5,2) (empty space). This is safe but does not directly target the closest apple.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (6,1) (empty space). This is safe and positions the snake closer to the nearest apple at (6,4). From (6,1), subsequent RIGHT moves can reach (6,4) in 3 steps (RIGHT to (6,2), RIGHT to (6,3), RIGHT to (6,4)).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is optimal as it avoids collision, positions the snake closer to the nearest apple, and allows a clear path to eat that apple in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS S #\n#SSSSSA#\n#S     #\n#H  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, and the epoch is 31. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. The snake is moving down, so the next move will be in the direction we choose, but we can't reverse direction. Since the current direction is DOWN, the possible directions we can choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Wait, no—wait, the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. Reversing would be if current direction is UP, you can't go DOWN; if current is DOWN, can't go UP. Wait, no, wait the problem statement says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Oh, wait, the example says 'UP' to 'DOWN' is a reverse. So, reversing is 180-degree turn. So, if current direction is DOWN, the snake can't turn UP (since that's reverse). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. Because DOWN is current direction, so allowed. So the possible directions are DOWN (same), LEFT, RIGHT. Because UP would be reverse.\n\nNow, the snake's head is at position (6,1) assuming rows are 0-based from top. Let's map the board rows. Let's index rows from 0 to 7 (since 8x8). So row 0 is the top, row 7 is the bottom. Each row has 8 characters (columns 0-7). Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7: all #)\nRow 1: #  A   # (columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #)\nRow 2: #SSS   # (columns 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #)\nRow 3: #SSS S # (columns 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: #)\nRow 4: #SSSSSA# (columns 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'A', 7: #)\nRow 5: #S     # (columns 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #)\nRow 6: #H  A  # (columns 0: #, 1: 'H', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #)\nRow 7: ######## (columns 0-7: #)\n\nSo the head 'H' is in row 6, column 1. The current direction is DOWN, which means the next move would be towards row 7 (since moving down increases the row number). Let's check where the head would move if we choose each possible direction.\n\nPossible directions (since current is DOWN, can't choose UP):\n\n1. DOWN: Move to row 7, column 1. But row 7 is the bottom wall (all #), so that's a collision with the wall. The game would end. So this is bad.\n\n2. LEFT: Move to row 6, column 0. Column 0 is a wall (row 6, column 0 is '#'), so collision with wall. Bad.\n\n3. RIGHT: Move to row 6, column 2. Let's check that cell. Row 6, column 2 is ' ' (empty). So no collision. So moving right is possible.\n\nSo what's in the current position of the head (row 6, column 1). When the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and the body follows. Since the snake's length depends on how many apples it's eaten. Let's see: the snake starts with length 1. Each apple increases length by 1. Let's count the apples. The initial apples are 3. Let's check the current board:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1 has 'A' at column 3.\n\nRow 4 has 'A' at column 6.\n\nRow 6 has 'A' at column 4.\n\nSo there are 3 apples. So the snake hasn't eaten any apples yet? Because if it had, the apples would be replaced. Let's check the snake's body. The snake's body is all 'S's. Let's count the 'S's. Let's see:\n\nRow 2: 3 S's (columns 1-3).\n\nRow 3: 4 S's? Columns 1-3 and 5: 1,2,3 (three) and 5 (one), total 4.\n\nRow 4: 5 S's (columns 1-5).\n\nRow 5: 1 S (column 1).\n\nSo total S's: 3 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 13. But the snake starts with length 1. Each apple eaten increases length by 1, so current length is 1 + number of apples eaten. So 13 S's plus 1 H (head) would be 14 segments. So 14 = 1 + number of apples eaten. So number of apples eaten is 13? But that's impossible because there are only 3 apples on the board. So maybe the initial apples are 3, and the snake has eaten some, and new apples are generated? The problem statement says \"the game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Each time the snake eats an apple, ... and the game starts with 3 apples.\" So when the snake eats an apple, a new one is placed? The example shows that after eating an apple, the board has new apples. Let's check the example:\n\nOriginal example board had:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAfter moving down (direction DOWN), the head moves to the cell below (row 4, column 1, which was 'A'). Then the snake eats the apple, grows, and the new board has:\n\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSo in the original, row 3 was 'H' (row 3), row 4 had 'AA' (columns 1 and 2). After moving down, row 4 (original) becomes 'HA' (so H is at row 4, column 1, and A at column 2). The row 3 (original) now has 'S' (since the body follows). So the apple that was at row 4, column 1 (original) is eaten, and a new apple is placed elsewhere (row 1, column 2 and 4). So the total apples remain 3? Original example had 3 apples (row 1, column 5; row 4, columns 1 and 2). After eating one, the new board has 3 apples (row 1, columns 2 and 4; row 4, column 2). So yes, each time an apple is eaten, a new one is placed. So the number of apples remains 3.\n\nSo back to current problem. The snake's body length is 13 S's plus H (14). So 14 segments. Since starting length is 1, the snake has eaten 13 apples (14-1=13). So the apples on the board now are 3, as per the problem statement (since each eaten apple is replaced).\n\nNow, the head is at (6,1). Let's think about possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So the snake is moving down. The next move direction can be DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (since UP is reverse).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. DOWN: Next position is (7,1). Row 7 is a wall (all #), so collision. Game over. So can't choose DOWN.\n\n2. LEFT: Next position is (6,0). Column 0 is a wall. Collision. Game over. Can't choose LEFT.\n\n3. RIGHT: Next position is (6,2). Let's check (6,2). The cell is ' ' (empty). So no collision. Then, the snake moves. The head moves to (6,2). The body segments follow. Since the snake's length is 14, the tail (the last segment) will only move if the snake doesn't eat an apple. If the head moves to a cell with an apple, the snake grows (so the tail doesn't move). If not, the tail moves (so the length remains the same).\n\nNow, (6,2) is empty (no 'A'), so the snake doesn't eat an apple. So the tail (the last S) will be removed. Let's track the body. The snake's body is a sequence of S's. The head is at (6,1), and the body follows. The direction of movement is important for the body's path. Since the current direction is DOWN, the previous move was in the DOWN direction. So the body segments are in the path the head took.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe. Let's check if that cell is part of the body. The body S's are in rows 2,3,4,5. (6,2) is row 6, column 2. Let's check the S positions:\n\nRow 2: columns 1,2,3.\n\nRow 3: columns 1,2,3,5.\n\nRow 4: columns 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nRow 5: column 1.\n\nSo (6,2) is not an S. So moving there is safe. So RIGHT is a valid direction.\n\nAre there any other options? The other possible directions are DOWN (wall), LEFT (wall), so only RIGHT is possible. So the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS S #\n#SSSSSA#\n#S     #\n#H  A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the current state:\n\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at row 6, column 1 (0-indexed).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid here).\n- **Possible Directions**: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (UP is reversed and invalid).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to row 7, column 1. Row 7 is a wall (all '#'), causing a collision. Game over. ❌  \n2. **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to row 6, column 0. Column 0 is a wall (all '#'), causing a collision. Game over. ❌  \n3. **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to row 6, column 2. This cell is empty (' '), with no snake body ('S') or wall ('#'). Safe move. ✅  \n\nThus, the only valid direction to avoid collision is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's list out each row to visualize it better:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  A   # (so positions (1,2) is 'A', others are spaces except walls)\nRow 2: #SSS   # (positions (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) are 'S')\nRow 3: #SSS   # (positions (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are 'S')\nRow 4: #SSSSSA# (positions (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are 'S', (4,6) is 'A')\nRow 5: #S     # (position (5,1) is 'S')\nRow 6: #SH A  # (positions (6,1) is 'S', (6,2) is 'H' (head), (6,4) is 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the snake is moving in that direction. The snake can't reverse direction, so if the current direction is RIGHT, the next direction can't be LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since reversing to LEFT is not allowed).\n\nFirst, let's find the head position. The head 'H' is in row 6, column 2 (since rows are 0-7, columns 0-7; each row starts with '#' at column 0 and ends with '#' at column 7). So H is at (6,2).\n\nThe snake's body is represented by 'S's. Let's track the snake's body to know where it is. The head is at (6,2). The next part of the body (since the snake moves, the body follows) would be the positions the head was in previously. Let's see:\n\nLooking at row 6: #SH A  #. So (6,1) is 'S' (so that's the next part of the body, since the head was there before moving right to (6,2)). Then, row 5: #S     # (so (5,1) is 'S'), which was the position before (6,1). Then row 4: #SSSSSA#. So (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are 'S's. Let's list the body segments in order (from head to tail):\n\nHead is (6,2). Then the body is (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Let's check if that makes sense. The snake's movement: when moving right, the head moves right, and each body segment follows the previous one. Let's confirm the direction the snake was moving before. The current direction is RIGHT, so the head was at (6,1) in the previous step, then moved right to (6,2), making (6,1) part of the body. Then before that, the head was at (5,1), moving up (since (5,1) is S, then (6,1) is S, so movement from (5,1) to (6,1) would be DOWN. Wait, but the current direction is RIGHT. Hmm, perhaps the snake's movement history is such that it's now moving RIGHT. Let's not get stuck on that; focus on the current positions.\n\nThe next step: the snake will move in the direction we choose (UP, DOWN, RIGHT, but not LEFT, as that's reversing the current direction of RIGHT). Let's check where the head would go in each possible direction:\n\nCurrent head position: (6,2). Directions:\n\n- RIGHT: (6,3). Let's check what's there. The row 6 is \"#SH A  #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'H', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (6,3) is a space. So moving right to (6,3) is possible. Then, the body would follow: the previous head (6,2) becomes 'S', and the rest of the body shifts.\n\n- UP: (5,2). Let's check row 5: \"#S     #\". Columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (5,2) is a space. So moving up to (5,2) is possible.\n\n- DOWN: (7,2). But row 7 is \"########\", so (7,2) is a wall. So moving down would hit a wall, which is a collision. So DOWN is invalid.\n\n- LEFT: (6,1). But (6,1) is 'S' (body part). Also, current direction is RIGHT, so reversing to LEFT is not allowed. So LEFT is invalid (both direction reversal and collision with body).\n\nSo possible directions are RIGHT and UP. Now, check if any of these directions lead to apples (A), which would increase the score and make the snake grow.\n\nCurrent apples on the board: Let's find all 'A's.\n\nRow 1: (1,2) is 'A'.\n\nRow 4: (4,6) is 'A'.\n\nRow 6: (6,4) is 'A'.\n\nSo three apples as per the problem statement.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (6,3): (6,3) is a space, no apple. So no score increase. The snake's head moves there, and the body follows.\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (5,2): (5,2) is a space, no apple. So no score.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's check the positions again.\n\nRow 6: \"#SH A  #\" → columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'H', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (6,4) is 'A'. So the head is at (6,2). If moving RIGHT, next positions would be (6,3), then (6,4) (if next move is right again). So (6,4) is an apple. So perhaps moving RIGHT now would allow the snake to reach that apple in the next step, but not this step.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the current possible moves and see which is safer to avoid collision and reach apples.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's body positions. Let's list all the 'S' positions:\n\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n\nRow 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nRow 5: (5,1)\n\nRow 6: (6,1)\n\nSo all the 'S' positions are:\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3),\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3),\n\n(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5),\n\n(5,1),\n\n(6,1).\n\nNow, possible next positions:\n\n- RIGHT: (6,3). Is (6,3) a body part? No. So safe.\n\n- UP: (5,2). Is (5,2) a body part? The 'S's in row 5 are only (5,1), so (5,2) is safe.\n\nSo both RIGHT and UP are safe. Which direction is better? Let's see where the apples are. The apple at (6,4) is in row 6, column 4. If the snake continues moving RIGHT, next step (6,3), then next move RIGHT again would reach (6,4) which is an apple. That would be good. So moving RIGHT now allows the snake to approach that apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,2). Then, what's around (5,2)? Let's see row 5: \"#S     #\". (5,2) is empty. Then, possible next directions from there could be UP (to (4,2)), but (4,2) is 'S' (since row 4 has (4,2) as 'S'), so that's a collision. So if the snake moves UP to (5,2), then the next possible directions (since current direction would be UP) can't reverse (so can't go DOWN). So possible directions would be LEFT, RIGHT, UP. If direction is UP, next position (4,2) is 'S' (body), which is collision. So moving UP might lead to a dead end.\n\nIn contrast, moving RIGHT to (6,3). Then the current direction would be RIGHT (since we chose RIGHT again). Next possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (can't go LEFT). The next position (6,4) is 'A' (apple). So moving RIGHT again would allow the snake to eat that apple. So that's a good path.\n\nTherefore, the best direction is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS   #\n#SSSSSA#\n#S     #\n#SH A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6,2) (row 6, column 2). The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. We need to choose between UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (7,2), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). This causes a collision, so DOWN is invalid.  \n- **UP**: The head would move to (5,2). Checking the board, (5,2) is empty (row 5: \"#S     #\"), so no collision. However, moving UP may lead to a dead end (e.g., next move UP to (4,2) would hit the snake's body, as (4,2) is 'S').  \n- **RIGHT**: The head would move to (6,3). This position is empty (row 6: \"#SH A  #\"), so no collision. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to approach the apple at (6,4) in the next step, which is a better path to collect apples.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's list out each row to visualize it better:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  A   # (so positions (1,2) is A, others are empty except walls)\nRow 2: #SSS   # (positions (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) are S)\nRow 3: #SSS   # (positions (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are S)\nRow 4: #SSSS A# (positions (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) are S; (4,6) is A)\nRow 5: #S     # (position (5,1) is S)\nRow 6: #SSHA  # (positions (6,1) is S, (6,2) is S, (6,3) is H (head), (6,4) is A)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the current epoch is 33 (so we have 67 epochs left before the game ends automatically). The snake's head is at (6,3) (since H is in row 6, column 3; assuming rows are 0-7 top to bottom, columns 0-7 left to right). \n\nThe snake's movement direction is RIGHT. The next move will be the head moving one square in the current direction (RIGHT), unless the player changes direction (but cannot reverse). Since current direction is RIGHT, the possible directions the player can choose are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since reversing would be LEFT, which is not allowed).\n\nLet's check where the head is now. The head (H) is at (6,3). The body (S) is around it. Let's list the snake's body positions. The snake's body includes all the S's connected to the head. Let's track the snake's body segments:\n\nStarting from the head (6,3). The snake moves in the RIGHT direction, so the previous position (the next segment) would be to the LEFT of the head. Let's see:\n\nIn row 6: #SSHA  #. So positions (6,1)=S, (6,2)=S, (6,3)=H, (6,4)=A. So the head is at (6,3). The segment before the head (since direction was RIGHT, the previous position would be (6,2), which is S. Then (6,1) is S. Then, moving up, row 5: #S     #, (5,1)=S. Then row 4: #SSSS A#. (4,1)=S, (4,2)=S, (4,3)=S, (4,4)=S. Row 3: (3,1)=S, (3,2)=S, (3,3)=S. Row 2: (2,1)=S, (2,2)=S, (2,3)=S. So the snake's body is a long chain from (2,1) to (2,3), (3,1-3), (4,1-4), (5,1), (6,1-2), (6,3) as H. So the snake is quite long, coiled in the left part of the grid.\n\nNow, the head is at (6,3). Current direction is RIGHT, so the next move would be to (6,4) if direction remains RIGHT. Let's check (6,4): in row 6, it's 'A' (apple). So if the snake moves RIGHT, the head will move to (6,4), which is an apple. Eating the apple would make the snake grow. The new head is at (6,4), and the body segments would follow. Since the snake was moving RIGHT, the previous head position (6,3) becomes a body segment (S), and the rest of the body shifts accordingly. Also, eating the apple increases the score by 1.\n\nBut we need to check if moving RIGHT would cause a collision. Let's see: (6,4) is A, which is not a wall (walls are at columns 0 and 7, rows 0 and 7). The head is moving to (6,4). Are there any S's there? The current (6,4) is A, so no S. So moving RIGHT would be safe, and the snake eats the apple. That's good.\n\nWhat are the other possible directions? The current direction is RIGHT, so the player can't choose LEFT (reverse). The options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check UP: direction UP. The head is at (6,3). Moving UP would take it to (5,3). Let's check (5,3): row 5 is #S     #. So (5,0) is #, (5,1)=S, (5,2)=empty, (5,3)=empty, (5,4)=empty, (5,5)=empty, (5,6)=empty, (5,7)=#. So (5,3) is empty. So moving UP to (5,3) is possible. But are there any S's there? (5,3) is empty, so no collision. Then, the next position is (5,3). But then, after moving, the body would follow. But the current body includes (5,1) as S. So (5,3) is empty. So moving UP is safe. But there's no apple there, so no score gain.\n\nCheck DOWN: direction DOWN. The head is at (6,3). Moving DOWN would take it to (7,3). But row 7 is all walls (########), so (7,3) is a wall. So moving DOWN would cause a collision with the wall, which ends the game. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nCheck LEFT: direction LEFT. The current direction is RIGHT, so LEFT is reverse. The snake cannot reverse direction. So LEFT is not allowed. So possible directions are RIGHT, UP.\n\nSo between RIGHT and UP. Let's think: moving RIGHT leads to eating an apple (A at (6,4)), which is good. So that's a better choice. Because eating the apple increases the score and the snake grows. Also, moving RIGHT is safe because (6,4) is A, not a wall or body. So the best direction is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS   #\n#SSSS A#\n#S     #\n#SSHA  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is located at position (6,3) (row 6, column 3), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT. \n\n- **RIGHT**: The head would move to (6,4), which is an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or body collision) and would result in eating the apple, increasing the score by 1, and growing the snake.  \n- **UP**: The head would move to (5,3), which is empty. No apple is present here, so no score gain.  \n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (7,3), which is a wall ('#'), causing an immediate collision and game over.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move RIGHT to eat the apple and avoid collision. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS   #\n#SSSS A#\n#S     #\n#SSSHA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT, and the epoch is 34. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. Let's locate the head first. Looking at the board, the last line is \"#SSSHA #\", so the H is in row 6 (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top). Let's check the positions:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  A   # → columns 2 is A\nRow 2: #SSS   # → columns 1-3 are S\nRow 3: #SSS   # → columns 1-3 are S\nRow 4: #SSSS A# → columns 1-4 are S, column 6 is A\nRow 5: #S     # → column 1 is S\nRow 6: #SSSHA # → columns 1-3 are S, column 4 is S, column 5 is H, column 6 is A.\n\nWait, row 6: Let's index columns from 0. So row 6 is \"# S S S H A #\". So columns 0 is #, 1 is S, 2 is S, 3 is S, 4 is H, 5 is A, 6 is space? Wait, no. Let's parse each row properly. Let's count the columns (each row is 8 characters, 0-7).\n\nRow 6: \"#SSSHA #\" → characters are 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'H', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'? Wait, no. Let's check again. The row is \"#SSSHA #\", which is 8 characters. So positions 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'H', 6: 'A', 7: '#'? Because \"SSSHA\" would be 5 characters. Let's see: \"#\" (0), then S S S H A, but that's 5 letters. Wait, the row is \"#SSSHA #\". Let's split into each character:\n\nIndices 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'H', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'? That would make 8 characters. Or maybe 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'H', 6: 'A', 7: '#'? Because \"SSSHA\" is 5 letters. Let's count: \"#SSSHA #\" → 1 (S), 2 (S), 3 (S), 4 (S), 5 (H), 6 (A), 7 (#). So row 6: column 5 is H, column 6 is A, column 7 is #. That makes sense. So H is at (6,5) (row 6, column 5). The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake is moving to the right. The next position if moving RIGHT would be (6,6), which is A (since row 6, column 6 is A). \n\nWait, row 6 is \"#SSSHA #\". Let's confirm each position:\n\nRow 6:\n0: '#'\n1: 'S'\n2: 'S'\n3: 'S'\n4: 'S'\n5: 'H'\n6: 'A'\n7: '#'\n\nYes, that's 8 characters. So H is at (6,5). Current direction is RIGHT. So next move direction options: the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is RIGHT, so the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since reversing would be LEFT, which is not allowed). So possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, the head would go to (6,6), which is A. So eating the apple. Then the snake would grow. The body would follow. The previous head position (6,5) becomes part of the body. So that's a good move because it eats an apple, increasing the score. \n\nWhat if the snake moves UP? Let's see. UP direction: from (6,5) moving up would be row 5, column 5. Let's check row 5: \"#S     #\". So row 5, column 5 is a space (since row 5 is \"#S     #\": columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'). So (5,5) is empty. That's safe, but no apple.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN: current row is 6. Moving down would take it to row 7, which is a wall (since the board is 8x8, rows 0 and 7 are walls). So row 7 is all '#', so (7,5) is a wall. That's a collision, game over. So moving DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo the possible directions are RIGHT (safe, eats apple), UP (safe, no apple), or LEFT (invalid, reversing direction). So the best choice is RIGHT, because it allows the snake to eat the apple at (6,6), which is the next position. That's the optimal move here.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS   #\n#SSSS A#\n#S     #\n#SSSHA #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at row 6, column 5. The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). \n\n- Moving RIGHT: The head will move to row 6, column 6, which contains an 'A' (apple). Eating the apple will increase the score by 1, and the snake will grow. This move is safe and beneficial.\n- Moving UP: The head will move to row 5, column 5, which is an empty space. This is safe but does not eat an apple.\n- Moving DOWN: The head will move to row 7, column 5, which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision and ends the game.\n\nThe optimal choice is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let me start by visualizing the board. The board is 8x8 with walls ('#') around the edges. \n\nThe game board provided is:\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS   #\n#SSSS A#\n#S     #\n#SSSSH #\n########\n\nSo let's break down each row:\n\nRow 0 (top): ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  AA  # → positions (1,2) and (1,3) are 'A's (apples)\nRow 2: #SSS   # → positions (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) are 'S' (snake body)\nRow 3: #SSS   # → positions (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are 'S'\nRow 4: #SSSS A# → positions (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) are 'S'; (4,5) is 'A'\nRow 5: #S     # → position (5,1) is 'S'\nRow 6: #SSSSH # → positions (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) are 'S'; (6,5) is 'H' (head)\nRow 7 (bottom): ######## (all walls)\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the snake is moving right. The head 'H' is at (6,5). Let's confirm the coordinates: rows are 0-7, columns 0-7. So (row, column). So row 6, column 5 is the head.\n\nThe snake's body is the 'S's. Let's list the positions of the snake's body and head. The head is at (6,5). The body segments are:\n\nLooking at row 6: #SSSSH # → columns 1,2,3,4 are S → (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\nRow 5: #S     # → column 1 is S → (5,1)\nRow 4: #SSSS A# → columns 1,2,3,4 are S → (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\nRow 3: #SSS   # → columns 1,2,3 → (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\nRow 2: #SSS   # → columns 1,2,3 → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n\nSo the snake's body is a long chain. The head is at (6,5). Since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move would be to (6,6) if the direction is RIGHT. Let's check what's in (6,6). The row 6 is \"#SSSSH #\", which has 7 characters (since it's 8 columns, the first is #, then 5,6,7? Wait, wait, each row is 8 characters (including the first and last #). Let me recount each row correctly.\n\nEach row is 8 characters. Let's index columns 0 to 7 (left to right):\n\nRow 0: ######## → columns 0-7: all #\nRow 1: #  AA  # → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 2: #SSS   # → columns 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 3: #SSS   # → columns 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 4: #SSSS A# → columns 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: 'A', 7: # → Wait, the original row 4 is \"#SSSS A#\", which is 8 characters. Let's split:\n\nCharacters: [0] '#', [1] 'S', [2] 'S', [3] 'S', [4] 'S', [5] ' ', [6] 'A', [7] '#' → So (4,6) is 'A' (apple)\nRow 5: #S     # → columns 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 6: #SSSSH # → columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'H', 6: ' ', 7: '#' → So head is at (6,5). So the next position if moving RIGHT (current direction) would be (6,6). What's (6,6)? Column 6 in row 6 is ' ', which is empty. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (6,6). \n\nBut we need to check if that's a valid move. The snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is RIGHT. The possible directions the player can input are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, but cannot reverse. Since current direction is RIGHT, reversing would be LEFT. So the player can choose UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse).\n\nNow, what's the next position for each possible direction:\n\nCurrent head position: (6,5)\n\nIf direction is RIGHT (current direction, allowed): next head is (6,6). Check if that's a wall or body. (6,6) is ' ' (from row 6: #SSSSH # → column 6 is ' '), so no collision. So safe.\n\nIf direction is UP: moving up from (6,5) would be (5,5). Let's check (5,5). Row 5 is \"#S     #\", columns 0-7: 0=#,1=S, 2-6= ' ', 7=#. So (5,5) is ' ', safe.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: moving down from (6,5) would be (7,5). Row 7 is ########, so (7,5) is '#', which is a wall. Collision! So moving DOWN is invalid, game over. So direction DOWN is not allowed.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: reverse of current direction (RIGHT), which is not allowed. So direction LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are RIGHT, UP.\n\nNow, we need to see if moving in these directions leads to eating an apple. Let's check where the apples are. The apples are 'A's on the board. Let's list all 'A's:\n\nRow 1: columns 2 and 3 → (1,2), (1,3)\nRow 4: column 6 → (4,6)\nSo apples are at (1,2), (1,3), (4,6).\n\nCurrent head is (6,5). Let's check the next positions:\n\nRIGHT: (6,6) → is (6,6) an apple? Row 6, column 6: in row 6, the characters are # S S S S H  (wait, original row 6 is \"#SSSSH #\". Let's confirm:\n\nRow 6: index 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'H', 6: ' ', 7: '#' → (6,6) is ' ', no apple.\n\nUP: (5,5) → row 5, column 5. Row 5 is \"#S     #\", which is (5,0)=#, (5,1)=S, (5,2) to (5,6) are ' ', (5,7)=#. So (5,5) is ' ', no apple.\n\nSo neither direction RIGHT nor UP would eat an apple now. But we need to plan ahead to avoid collisions and reach apples.\n\nLet's think about the snake's body. The snake's body is a chain of 'S's. When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail (last 'S') is removed unless it eats an apple (then the tail stays, increasing length).\n\nThe current snake's body is a long structure. Let's think about the snake's path. The head is at (6,5), moving RIGHT. If we move RIGHT to (6,6), then the next move's possible directions would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since current direction would be RIGHT). Let's check (6,6) next. (6,6) is empty. Then, next move. Let's see where the apples are. The apples are in row 1 (columns 2,3) and row 4 (column 6). The head is at row 6. To reach row 1, the snake would need to move up multiple times. But there's a lot of body in rows 2,3,4,5. Let's check the path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,5). Then the next direction can't be DOWN (reverse of UP). The next possible directions would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since current direction would be UP, reverse is DOWN). Let's see (5,5) is safe. Then, moving further up to (4,5). Let's check (4,5): row 4 is \"#SSSS A#\", columns 0-7: 0=#,1=S,2=S,3=S,4=S,5= ' ', 6=A, 7=#. So (4,5) is ' ', safe. Then (4,5) → next direction could be UP (to (3,5)), which is row 3: \"#SSS   #\", (3,5) is ' ', safe. Then (3,5) → (2,5) (row 2: \"#SSS   #\", (2,5) is ' '). Then (2,5) → (1,5). Row 1 is \"#  AA  #\", (1,5) is ' ', safe. Then (1,5) → (1,4), (1,3) which is an apple. So if the snake moves up, then right, it could reach the apple at (1,3).\n\nBut maybe moving RIGHT first is better. Let's see. If the snake moves RIGHT to (6,6), then next possible directions (since direction is RIGHT) can be UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Let's check (6,6) → (6,7) is a wall (row 6, column 7 is #), so can't go RIGHT again. So next direction from (6,6) would be UP (to (5,6)) or DOWN (invalid, row 7 is wall). (5,6): row 5, column 6 is ' ', safe. Then (5,6) → (4,6), which is an apple! Oh, row 4, column 6 is 'A' (from row 4: \"#SSSS A#\" → column 6 is 'A'). So if the snake moves RIGHT to (6,6), then UP to (5,6), then UP to (4,6), which is an apple. That's a path to an apple. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head (6,5). Move RIGHT to (6,6). Then direction could be UP (since current direction is RIGHT, next direction can be UP). Then head moves to (5,6). Then direction is UP again (since moving from (5,6) with direction UP would go to (4,6)), which is the apple at (4,6). So that's a possible path.\n\nSo moving RIGHT now allows the snake to reach the apple at (4,6) in two moves. Alternatively, moving UP now would take the head to (5,5), which is further from the apples. \n\nAnother thing to check is whether moving in any direction would cause a collision with the body. Let's check possible next positions:\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: next head (6,6). The body is all the 'S's. (6,6) is ' ', no S. Safe.\n\nIf direction is UP: next head (5,5). (5,5) is ' ', no S. Safe.\n\nDirection DOWN is wall, invalid. Direction LEFT is reverse, invalid.\n\nSo the possible choices are RIGHT and UP. Which is better? The apple at (4,6) is closer if we go RIGHT then UP. Let's confirm the positions:\n\nCurrent head (6,5). \n\nMove RIGHT → (6,6). Then direction UP → (5,6). Then direction UP → (4,6) (apple). That's two moves. \n\nIf we move UP first → (5,5). Then direction RIGHT → (5,6). Then direction UP → (4,6). That's also two moves, but same number. But perhaps moving RIGHT first is better because it's the current direction and doesn't require changing direction, which might be more straightforward. Also, since the snake can't reverse, keeping the current direction might be safer. \n\nAlternatively, is there any risk in moving RIGHT? Let's see the next position (6,6) is safe, no body or wall. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nSo the best direction here is RIGHT, as it allows the snake to proceed towards the apple at (4,6) in the next steps without collision.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS   #\n#SSSS A#\n#S     #\n#SSSSH #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6,5) (row 6, column 5), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid) and must avoid walls (#) and self-collision (S). \n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (6,5) leads to (7,5), which is a wall (#). This causes a collision, so DOWN is invalid.\n- **LEFT**: Reverses the current direction (RIGHT → LEFT), which is not allowed. Invalid.\n- **UP**: Moving up from (6,5) leads to (5,5). This position is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe. However, (5,5) does not contain an apple.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (6,5) leads to (6,6). This position is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe. (6,6) does not contain an apple, but this direction keeps the snake moving toward the apple at (4,6) (row 4, column 6) in subsequent moves (e.g., RIGHT → UP → UP to reach the apple).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is safe, maintains progress toward an apple, and avoids collisions. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to look at the current game board and the current direction. The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake can't reverse direction, so it can't go LEFT immediately. Let's start by understanding the snake's position.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls (#). Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  AA  # → columns 2 and 3 are apples (A)\nRow 2: #SSS   # → columns 1,2,3 are S (snake body)\nRow 3: #SSS   # → columns 1,2,3 are S\nRow 4: #SSS  A# → columns 1,2,3 are S; column 6 is A\nRow 5: #S     # → column 1 is S\nRow 6: #SSSSSH# → columns 1,2,3,4,5 are S; column 6 is H (head)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at row 6, column 6. The current direction is RIGHT. So normally, if the snake continues moving RIGHT, where would the head go next? The next position would be row 6, column 7. But row 6, column 7 is a wall (since row 6 is #SSSSSH#, which has 7 characters: # at 0, S at 1-5, H at 6, then # at 7). So moving RIGHT would hit the wall, which is a collision. That's bad. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nSo the snake can't go RIGHT (current direction) because that's a wall. Now, the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (but can't reverse, so LEFT is allowed since current is RIGHT; reversing would be LEFT if current was RIGHT? Wait, the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. Reversing is when you go from UP to DOWN or DOWN to UP, LEFT to RIGHT or RIGHT to LEFT. So if current direction is RIGHT, the reverse is LEFT. So the snake cannot turn directly to LEFT. Oh right! Because reversing direction would mean the head moving into the body. So the allowed directions are UP or DOWN, since LEFT is the reverse of RIGHT and thus not allowed.\n\nSo possible directions are UP or DOWN. Let's check each.\n\nFirst, current head position is (6,6) (row 6, column 6). Let's check moving UP. Moving UP would take the head to row 5, column 6. What's in row 5, column 6? Let's look at row 5: #S     #. The columns are 0: #, 1:S, 2-5: spaces, 6: space, 7: #. So row 5, column 6 is empty (a space). So that's safe. Then, after moving UP, the head is at (5,6). Then, since the snake is moving, the body follows. The current snake's body is a chain. Let's think about the snake's body segments. The head is at (6,6). The body segments before the head would be (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) because row 6 is #SSSSSH# → positions 1-5 are S, 6 is H. Then row 5: #S     # → position 1 is S. Row 4: #SSS  A# → positions 1-3 are S. Row 3: #SSS   # → positions 1-3 are S. Row 2: #SSS   # → positions 1-3 are S. So the snake's body is a long chain. Let's list all the S positions (body) and H (head):\n\nH is at (6,6).\n\nBody segments (S) are:\n\nRow 6: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) → 5 segments.\n\nRow 5: (5,1) → 1 segment.\n\nRow 4: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) → 3 segments.\n\nRow 3: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) → 3 segments.\n\nRow 2: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) → 3 segments.\n\nSo total length is 1 (head) + 5+1+3+3+3 = 16 segments? Let's count: 5 (row 6) + 1 (row5) + 3 (row4) +3 (row3) +3 (row2) = 15 S's, plus H: 16 total length.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So if the snake moves UP to (5,6), the new head is (5,6). Then the next segment (the one that was at (6,6) becomes S, and each previous segment shifts. But since the snake's length doesn't increase unless it eats an apple, we need to check if (5,6) is an apple. Let's check row 5, column 6: it's a space (no A). So no apple eaten, so the snake's length remains the same. So the tail (the last segment) will move forward, i.e., the last S in the chain will be removed. But for collision detection, we need to check if the new head position is in the body or a wall.\n\nMoving UP: (5,6) is empty. So that's safe.\n\nNow check moving DOWN. Current head is (6,6). Moving DOWN would take it to row 7, column 6. Row 7 is ########, so column 6 is a wall. So moving DOWN would hit the wall, which is a collision. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP. Because moving RIGHT is wall, DOWN is wall, LEFT is reverse (not allowed), so only UP is possible. Let's confirm.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The possible directions the player can input are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. But the snake can't reverse direction. Reverse of RIGHT is LEFT, so can't go LEFT. So allowed directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. But RIGHT leads to wall (row 6, column 7 is #). DOWN leads to row 7, column 6 which is # (wall). So only UP is possible. Let's confirm the next position when moving UP.\n\nHead moves from (6,6) to (5,6). What's in (5,6)? The row 5 is \"#S     #\", so columns 0: #, 1:S, 2-5: spaces, 6: space, 7: #. So (5,6) is a space, safe. No collision. So UP is the only safe direction.\n\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS  A#\n#S     #\n#SSSSSH#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently at row 6, column 6, moving RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Checking possible directions:\n\n- **RIGHT**: Next position would be row 6, column 7 (a wall), causing collision. Invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Next position would be row 7, column 6 (a wall), causing collision. Invalid.\n- **LEFT**: Reverse of current direction (RIGHT → LEFT), which is not allowed. Invalid.\n- **UP**: Next position is row 5, column 6, which is empty (no wall or body collision). Safe.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board. \n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' as walls. Let's list out each row to visualize the snake's position and the apples.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  AA  # (so positions (1,2) and (1,3) are apples)\nRow 2: #SSS   # (positions (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) are S)\nRow 3: #SSS   # (positions (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are S)\nRow 4: #SS   A# (positions (4,1), (4,2) are S; (4,5) is A)\nRow 5: #S    H# (position (5,1) is S; (5,5) is H (head))\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# (positions (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are S)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake is moving up. The head (H) is at (5,5) (row 5, column 5, assuming rows are 0-based from top to bottom). Wait, rows: row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom. So row 5 is the 6th row from top. Let's confirm the coordinates. Let's index rows from 0 (top) to 7 (bottom), columns 0 (left) to 7 (right). So each cell is (row, column).\n\nRow 5: #S    H#. So the characters are: [0]#, [1]S, [2] , [3] , [4] , [5]H, [6] , [7]#. So H is at (5,5). \n\nCurrent direction is UP. So the next move would be towards row 5-1=4, column 5. So the next head position would be (4,5). Let's check what's there. \n\nLooking at row 4: #SS   A#. The characters are [0]#, [1]S, [2]S, [3] , [4] , [5]A, [6] , [7]#. So (4,5) is A (an apple). Oh, so if the snake continues moving UP (current direction), the head will move to (4,5), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple increases the score and the snake grows. \n\nBut wait, need to check if moving UP is allowed. The snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is UP. Reversing would be DOWN. So possible directions to turn are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP. So the player can choose UP (current direction), LEFT, or RIGHT. Because the current direction is UP, the snake can't go DOWN (since that's the reverse).\n\nSo the next head position if moving UP is (4,5). Let's confirm that. The current head is (5,5). Moving UP (row decreases by 1) to (4,5). What's in (4,5)? The row 4 is \"#SS   A#\", so column 5 is 'A' (apple). So eating that apple would be good. Then, the snake's length increases. The body would follow. Since the snake was moving UP, after moving, the new head is (4,5), and the previous positions of the body (from the tail) would shift. \n\nBut wait, we need to check if there's any collision. If moving UP, the new head is (4,5). Is that a wall? No, because row 4 is within 0-7 (walls are at 0 and 7). Column 5 is 5, which is within 0-7 (columns 0 and 7 are walls). So (4,5) is safe (not a wall). Also, is (4,5) part of the snake's body? Let's check the current body positions. The body is S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\nRow 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,2)\nRow 5: (5,1)\nRow 6: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\nSo (4,5) is A, not S. So no collision. So moving UP would result in eating the apple, which is good. \n\nWhat if we choose other directions? Let's see. Current direction is UP. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: The head (5,5) would move to (5,4). Let's check (5,4). Row 5 is \"#S    H#\", which is [0]#, [1]S, [2] , [3] , [4] , [5]H, [6] , [7]#. So (5,4) is empty (space). But then, after moving, the new head is (5,4). Then, the next move's direction could be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since current direction is LEFT now). But is (5,4) safe? No collision with walls or body. But there's no apple there, so no score gain. So not as good as moving UP which gets the apple.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: The head (5,5) would move to (5,6). Check (5,6). Row 5's [6] is a space (since row 5 is \"#S    H#\" → columns 0-7: 0=#, 1=S, 2= , 3= , 4= , 5=H, 6= , 7=#). So (5,6) is empty. But again, no apple here. So moving RIGHT would not get an apple. \n\nSo the best option is to continue moving UP, which allows the snake to eat the apple at (4,5), increasing the score. Also, moving UP is allowed (since it's the current direction, not reversed). There's no collision, so the game continues. \n\nTherefore, the correct direction to choose is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  AA  #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS   #\n#SS   A#\n#S    H#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5,5) (row 5, column 5) and is currently moving UP. The next potential head positions for each valid direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT; DOWN is invalid as it reverses the current direction) are:\n\n- **UP**: Moves to (4,5). Checking row 4, column 5 is an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision) and will allow the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score.\n- **LEFT**: Moves to (5,4). This is an empty space (' '), with no apple. No score gain.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (5,6). This is an empty space (' '), with no apple. No score gain.\n\nMoving UP is optimal as it allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and increase the score without collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#  AA  #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS  A#\n#SS   H#\n#S    S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the epoch is 38, which is well before 100, so the game hasn't ended yet. \n\nFirst, let's identify the snake's position. The head is 'H' at some coordinate. Let's map the board rows. The rows are from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7), since the first line is ######## (row 0), then row 1: #  AA  #, row 2: #SSS   #, row 3: #SSS  A#, row 4: #SS   H#, row 5: #S    S#, row 6: #SSSSSS#, row 7: ########.\n\nSo the head 'H' is in row 4. Let's look at row 4: \"#SS   H#\". The characters are: index 0 is '#', 1 is 'S', 2 is 'S', 3 is ' ', 4 is ' ', 5 is 'H', 6 is '#'. So H is at (4,5) (row 4, column 5). \n\nThe current direction is UP. So the snake is moving upward. When the snake moves, the head will go to the next cell in the direction, and the body follows. But since the direction can't be reversed, if current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. The possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse of UP, which is not allowed).\n\nNow, we need to check where the head would move next for each possible direction, and see if it's a valid move (no collision with walls or self), and if there's an apple.\n\nFirst, current direction is UP. So moving UP would take the head from (4,5) to (3,5). Let's check row 3: \"#SSS  A#\". Columns 0-6: 0 is '#', 1 is 'S', 2 is 'S', 3 is 'S', 4 is ' ', 5 is ' ', 6 is 'A'. So (3,5) is a space ' '. Is that a body part? Let's see the current snake body. The body is 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1: #  AA  # → no S.\nRow 2: #SSS   # → columns 1,2,3 are S → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\nRow 3: #SSS  A# → columns 1,2,3 are S → (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\nRow 4: #SS   H# → columns 1,2 are S → (4,1), (4,2).\nRow 5: #S    S# → columns 1 and 5 are S → (5,1), (5,5).\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# → columns 1-6 (since it's 6 S's between the #) → (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nSo (3,5) is (row 3, column 5) → which is ' ' (from row 3: \"#SSS  A#\" → columns 4 is ' ', 5 is ' ', 6 is 'A'). So (3,5) is empty. So moving UP would be to (3,5), which is safe. But is there an apple there? No. The apple in row 3 is at (3,6).\n\nNext, possible direction is LEFT. Moving LEFT from (4,5) would take the head to (4,4). Let's check (4,4): row 4 is \"#SS   H#\" → columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'H', 6: '#'. So (4,4) is ' ' (empty). Is that part of the body? The body S's in row 4 are (4,1) and (4,2), so (4,4) is safe. So moving LEFT is possible.\n\nThird, possible direction is RIGHT. Moving RIGHT from (4,5) would take the head to (4,6), which is a wall (since row 4 ends with '#', column 6 is '#'). So that's a collision with the wall. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nFourth, direction DOWN: but current direction is UP, so can't reverse. So DOWN is not allowed.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, LEFT. Let's check the next positions for these directions.\n\nIf direction is UP: new head position (3,5). Then, the snake moves. The current head is (4,5). The body parts are all the S's. When the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and the tail (the last S) is removed only if no apple is eaten. Wait, but the rule says when the snake eats an apple, it grows in length. So if the head moves to an apple, the snake doesn't lose the tail (so length increases by 1). If not, the tail is removed (length stays the same).\n\nSo first, check if moving UP would hit an apple. (3,5) is ' ', so no apple. So after moving UP, the head is at (3,5), and the tail (the last S) would be removed. Let's see where the tail is. The snake's body is a chain. Since the snake is moving UP, the head was moving up, so the body follows. Let's think about the snake's body structure. The snake's head is at (4,5). The previous positions (body) would be behind it. Let's try to reconstruct the snake's path.\n\nLooking at the S positions:\n\nRow 6 has a lot of S's: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). Row 5: (5,1), (5,5). Row 4: (4,1), (4,2). Row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Row 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nAssuming the snake is moving UP, the head (H) is at (4,5). The body parts would be in the direction opposite to movement. Let's think: when moving up, the head is (4,5), the next part of the body would be (5,5) (since the snake was moving up from (5,5) to (4,5)). Let's check (5,5): yes, row 5 is \"#S    S#\", so (5,5) is 'S'. Then the next body part would be (6,5), which is in row 6: \"#SSSSSS#\", so (6,5) is 'S'. Then (6,6) is also S. But maybe the snake's body is a chain. Let's try to see the order. Let's list possible positions in order from head to tail.\n\nHead is (4,5). The previous position (since moving up) would be (5,5) (since the head moved up from (5,5) to (4,5)). Then (5,5) is S. Then the next body part would be (6,5), which is S. Then (6,6) is S. But (6,6) is at row 6, column 6. Then (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snake is a contiguous chain. Let's look for contiguous S's. For example, row 6: SSSSSS (columns 1-6). So (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). Then row 5 has (5,1) and (5,5). (5,1) is adjacent to (6,1) (down), so that's part of the chain. (5,5) is adjacent to (6,5) (down), so that's part of another chain? Or maybe the snake has multiple parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snake's body is a single connected chain. Let's check adjacency. The head is (4,5). What is adjacent to (4,5) (up, down, left, right) and is S? (4,5) is H. Up is (3,5) (empty). Down is (5,5) (S). Left is (4,4) (empty). Right is (4,6) (wall). So (5,5) is S and adjacent to H. So (5,5) is the next part of the body. Then (5,5) has adjacent S's. Let's check (5,5)'s neighbors. Up is (4,5) (H), down is (6,5) (S), left is (5,4) (empty), right is (5,6) (wall). So (6,5) is S. Then (6,5) has neighbors: up (5,5) (S), down (7,5) (wall), left (6,4) (S), right (6,6) (S). So (6,4) and (6,6) are S. So (6,5) is connected to (6,4) and (6,6). Let's go to (6,4). (6,4) has up (5,4) (empty), down (7,4) (wall), left (6,3) (S), right (6,5) (S). So (6,3) is S. Then (6,3) has up (5,3) (empty), down (7,3) (wall), left (6,2) (S), right (6,4) (S). So (6,2) is S. (6,2) has up (5,2) (empty), down (7,2) (wall), left (6,1) (S), right (6,3) (S). So (6,1) is S. (6,1) has up (5,1) (S), down (7,1) (wall), left (6,0) (wall), right (6,2) (S). So (5,1) is S. (5,1) has up (4,1) (S), down (6,1) (S), left (5,0) (wall), right (5,2) (empty). (4,1) is S. (4,1) has up (3,1) (S), down (5,1) (S), left (4,0) (wall), right (4,2) (S). (4,2) is S. (4,2) has up (3,2) (S), down (4,1) (S), left (4,3) (empty), right (4,3) (empty). (3,2) is S. (3,2) has up (2,2) (S), down (4,2) (S), left (3,1) (S), right (3,3) (S). (3,1) is S. (3,1) has up (2,1) (S), down (4,1) (S), left (3,0) (wall), right (3,2) (S). (2,1) is S. (2,1) has up (1,1) (empty), down (3,1) (S), left (2,0) (wall), right (2,2) (S). (2,2) is S. (2,2) has up (1,2) (empty), down (3,2) (S), left (2,1) (S), right (2,3) (S). (2,3) is S. (2,3) has up (1,3) (empty), down (3,3) (S), left (2,2) (S), right (2,4) (empty). (3,3) is S. (3,3) has up (2,3) (S), down (4,3) (empty), left (3,2) (S), right (3,4) (empty). \n\nSo the snake's body is a long chain. The head is (4,5). The next segments are (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3). \n\nSo the tail would be the last part of this chain. Let's see: (3,3) is S. What's next? (3,3) has up (2,3) (S), so (2,3) is before (3,3). Then (2,3) has up (1,3) (empty). So (2,3) is a segment. The tail is probably (3,3) or (2,3), but perhaps the tail is (2,3) since (3,3) is connected to (2,3) and (3,2). It's a bit complex, but perhaps for movement, when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and the tail is removed only if no apple is eaten.\n\nNow, the current apples are at: let's check the board.\n\nRow 1: #  AA  # → columns 3 and 4 are A → (1,3), (1,4).\n\nRow 3: #SSS  A# → column 6 is A → (3,6).\n\nSo apples are at (1,3), (1,4), (3,6).\n\nThe goal is to eat apples. So the snake should move towards apples to increase the score. Let's see where the apples are in relation to the head (4,5).\n\nHead is at (4,5). Let's list the apples:\n\n(1,3): row 1, column 3. That's above and to the left of the head.\n\n(1,4): row 1, column 4. Above and slightly left.\n\n(3,6): row 3, column 6. Above and to the right of the head (since head is (4,5), (3,6) is up one, right one).\n\nSo (3,6) is an apple. Let's check the position (3,6). The head is at (4,5). To reach (3,6), the snake would need to move right (from (4,5) to (4,6) is wall, so invalid) or up then right. Let's see: current direction is UP. If the snake moves UP to (3,5), then next possible direction could be RIGHT (since current direction would be UP, so next direction can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT). From (3,5), moving RIGHT would take to (3,6), which is the apple. That's a good path. So moving UP now would allow the snake to reach the apple (3,6) in the next move.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves LEFT now to (4,4), then where would that lead? (4,4) is empty. Then next direction could be UP, DOWN (but DOWN is reverse of current direction if current direction was LEFT, but no, the current direction after moving LEFT would be LEFT, so next direction can't be RIGHT. Let's see: if the snake moves LEFT, the new direction is LEFT. Then next move can't be RIGHT. So possible directions would be LEFT, UP, DOWN. But (4,4) is (row 4, column 4). Moving LEFT again would take to (4,3). Let's check (4,3): row 4 is \"#SS   H#\" → column 3 is ' ' (empty). So (4,3) is safe. But that's moving further left, away from the apples.\n\nThe apple at (3,6) is the closest. So the plan is to move UP to (3,5), then next move RIGHT to (3,6) to eat the apple. So moving UP now is a good choice.\n\nNow, check if moving UP would cause a collision. The new head position is (3,5). Let's check if (3,5) is a body part. From earlier, the S positions are: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (5,1), (5,5), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (3,5) is not in this list, so it's safe. So moving UP is valid.\n\nWhat about moving LEFT? (4,4) is empty, so that's safe. But moving LEFT would take the head to (4,4). Then the next move could be UP, but (4,4) moving UP would be (3,4). Let's check (3,4): row 3 is \"#SSS  A#\" → column 4 is ' ' (empty). So (3,4) is safe. But (3,4) is not an apple. The apples are at (1,3), (1,4), (3,6). So (3,4) is not an apple. So moving LEFT might not lead to an apple quickly.\n\nSo the best option is to move UP, which is allowed (current direction is UP, so can continue moving UP), and then next step move RIGHT to get the apple at (3,6). \n\nTherefore, the direction to choose is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  AA  #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS  A#\n#SS   H#\n#S    S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 4, column 5). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (4,5) leads to (4,6), which is a wall (collision). Invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (4,5) leads to (4,4), which is empty (no collision). However, this direction moves the head away from the nearest apple at (3,6).  \n- **UP**: Moving UP from (4,5) leads to (3,5), which is empty (no collision). This positions the head closer to the apple at (3,6) (next move could be RIGHT to reach the apple).  \n\nMoving UP is safe and strategically better for reaching the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS  H#\n#SS A S#\n#S    S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the current epoch is 39. The snake's head is 'H', body parts are 'S', apples are 'A', and walls are '#'.\n\nFirst, I need to find the position of the head. Let's look at each row. The rows are from top (first line) to bottom (last line). Let's list the rows:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  AA  # (columns 2 and 3 are A)\nRow 2: #SSS   # (columns 1,2,3 are S)\nRow 3: #SSS  H# (columns 1,2,3 are S; column 6 is H)\nRow 4: #SS A S# (columns 1,2 are S; column 4 is A; column 6 is S)\nRow 5: #S    S# (column 1 is S; column 6 is S)\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# (columns 1-6 are S)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is in row 3, column 6. The current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving upwards (toward row 2). Let's confirm the movement. The snake moves one square in the current direction each epoch. But the player can change direction (as long as it's not reversing), so we need to choose the next direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) that avoids collision and allows eating apples.\n\nFirst, check possible directions. The current direction is UP. The snake can't reverse direction, so the opposite direction is DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse of UP, which is not allowed).\n\nNow, let's check where each direction would move the head:\n\nCurrent head position (row, column) is (3,6).\n\n- If direction is UP: next position is (2,6). Let's check what's there. Row 2 is \"#SSS   #\". Columns 0 is #, 1-3 are S, 4-6 are empty (since the row is #SSS   #, so columns 4,5,6 are spaces). So (2,6) is a space. Is that part of the snake's body? Let's check all S positions. The body S's are in various positions. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 2: columns 1,2,3 → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\nRow 3: columns 1,2,3 → (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\nRow 4: columns 1,2 → (4,1), (4,2); column 6 → (4,6)\nRow 5: column 1 → (5,1); column 6 → (5,6)\nRow 6: columns 1-6 → (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSo (2,6) is a space (not S or #), so moving UP would be safe. But is there an apple there? Let's check row 2, column 6. The row is \"#SSS   #\", which is 8 characters. The 6th column (0-based) is index 6: the row is [0]# [1]S [2]S [3]S [4] [5] [6] [7]#. So (2,6) is a space, no apple.\n\nNext, direction LEFT: moving left from (3,6) would be (3,5). Let's check (3,5). Row 3 is \"#SSS  H#\", which is columns 0-7: [0]# [1]S [2]S [3]S [4] [5] [6]H [7]#. So (3,5) is a space (no S or #). So (3,5) is empty. Safe?\n\nCheck if (3,5) is part of the snake's body. Looking at the S positions listed earlier, (3,5) isn't in any of them. So moving LEFT to (3,5) is safe.\n\nDirection RIGHT: moving right from (3,6) would be (3,7). But row 3, column 7 is a wall ('#'), so that's a collision. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nDirection DOWN: reverse direction of UP, which is not allowed. So can't choose DOWN.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, LEFT.\n\nNow, check if moving in these directions leads to apples. Let's see where the apples are. The apples are in the board. Let's check all A positions.\n\nRow 1: \"#  AA  #\" → columns 2 and 3 (0-based). So (1,2), (1,3) are A.\n\nRow 4: \"#SS A S#\" → column 4 (0-based) is A. So (4,4) is A.\n\nSo current apples are at (1,2), (1,3), (4,4).\n\nNow, let's see where moving UP or LEFT would take the head, and if that's an apple.\n\nIf moving UP to (2,6): that's not an apple (apples are at (1,2), (1,3), (4,4)).\n\nIf moving LEFT to (3,5): that's (3,5). Is there an apple there? The row 3 is \"#SSS  H#\", which has no A. So (3,5) is empty.\n\nBut wait, after moving, the snake's body will shift. The snake's movement: when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body part follows the previous one. If the head eats an apple (moves to A), the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move (so the length increases by 1). Otherwise, the tail is removed (so the length stays the same).\n\nSo in the current state, the snake's body is a certain length. Let's figure out the snake's body segments. The head is at (3,6). The body segments are the S's. Let's try to find the order of the body. Since the snake was moving UP, the previous positions would be in the direction of movement. Let's think about the snake's path.\n\nThe snake's movement direction is UP. So the head was previously moving up. Let's see. The head is at (3,6). If the direction is UP, the previous position (before the last move) would be (4,6), because moving UP from (4,6) would reach (3,6). Let's check row 4, column 6: row 4 is \"#SS A S#\", so column 6 is S. So (4,6) is S. That's the body part right behind the head. Then the next body part would be (5,6), since moving UP from (5,6) to (4,6). Row 5, column 6 is S. Then (6,6) is S (row 6, column 6 is part of SSSSSS). So that's a vertical line from (6,6) up to (3,6) (head).\n\nBut wait, there are other S's in other rows. Let's see. For example, row 6 has SSSSSS (columns 1-6). So (6,1), (6,2), etc. So the snake's body is probably a more complex shape, not just a vertical line. Maybe the snake is coiled.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check for possible collisions. Let's check possible next positions.\n\nPossible directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) but RIGHT is wall, DOWN is reverse. So options are UP and LEFT.\n\nIf we choose UP:\n\nHead moves to (2,6). Check if (2,6) is wall? No, row 2 is \"#SSS   #\", column 6 is space. Is (2,6) part of the body? The body S's are in (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) (row 2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) (row 3), (4,1), (4,2) (row 4), (4,6) (row4, col6), (5,1) (row5, col1), (5,6) (row5, col6), (6,1-6) (row6). So (2,6) is not S, so safe.\n\nIf we choose LEFT:\n\nHead moves to (3,5). Check (3,5). The row 3 is \"#SSS  H#\", so column 5 is space. The S positions don't include (3,5), so safe.\n\nNow, which direction is better? Let's see the apple positions. The apples are at (1,2), (1,3), (4,4). Let's see the head's current position (3,6). To reach these apples, the snake would need to navigate.\n\nIf moving UP to (2,6), next possible moves. From (2,6), possible directions (since current direction would then be UP). The next direction can't be DOWN. So possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf moving UP again, (1,6). Row 1 is \"#  AA  #\", column 6 is space (since row 1 is \"#  AA  #\", which is 0: #, 1: space, 2:A, 3:A, 4: space, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #). So (1,6) is safe. Then from (1,6), direction could be LEFT to (1,5), (1,4), etc. But (1,2) and (1,3) are apples. So maybe moving up towards row 1 could get to those apples.\n\nAlternatively, if moving LEFT to (3,5). Then next direction could be LEFT again (to (3,4)), which is in row 3, column 4 (space). Then (3,3) is S (row 3, column 3 is S), so can't go to (3,3). So (3,4) is safe. From (3,4), possible directions. Let's see, (3,4) is space. Then perhaps moving down or up. But (4,4) is an apple (row 4, column 4 is A). So if the head is at (3,5), moving DOWN (but current direction would be LEFT, so can't reverse to RIGHT. Wait, if current direction is LEFT, then the next direction can't be RIGHT. So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nIf head is at (3,5) (after moving LEFT), direction is LEFT. Then next move would be (3,4). Then from (3,4), direction could be DOWN to (4,4), which is the apple. That's a good path. Because (4,4) is A. So moving LEFT now, then LEFT again to (3,4), then DOWN to (4,4) (if possible).\n\nLet's check that path. Current head (3,6) → LEFT to (3,5). Then direction LEFT again → (3,4). Then direction DOWN (since current direction is LEFT, so can turn DOWN). From (3,4), moving DOWN to (4,4). (4,4) is A. So that would allow the snake to eat the apple at (4,4). That's a good plan.\n\nIf we move UP now, the head goes to (2,6). Then next direction could be LEFT. From (2,6), moving LEFT to (2,5), (2,4), etc. But the apples in row 1 are at (1,2), (1,3). That's a bit further. Maybe that's possible, but the apple at (4,4) is closer.\n\nSo moving LEFT now might lead to the apple at (4,4) in the next steps. Let's confirm if the path is possible.\n\nCurrent head (3,6). Move LEFT to (3,5): safe.\n\nThen, direction LEFT again (since can't reverse). Move to (3,4): check (3,4). Row 3 is \"#SSS  H#\", which in column 4 is space (since columns 0-3 are #, S, S, S; columns 4-6 are spaces and H). So (3,4) is space, not S. Safe.\n\nNow head is at (3,4). Current direction is LEFT. Next possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN (can't go RIGHT). Let's choose DOWN. So move from (3,4) to (4,4). Check (4,4): row 4 is \"#SS A S#\", column 4 is A. So that's an apple. So the snake would eat it, grow, and score increases. That's a good move.\n\nSo the initial direction of LEFT would set up this path.\n\nAlternatively, if we move UP first. Head at (2,6). Then direction LEFT to (2,5). Then (2,4), (2,3) (but (2,3) is S, because row 2 is \"#SSS   #\", column 3 is S). So (2,3) is S, can't go there. So (2,4) is space, (2,5) is space, (2,6) is space. Then from (2,5), direction UP to (1,5). Then (1,4), (1,3) (which is A). That's possible, but that's a longer path. The apple at (4,4) is closer.\n\nSo moving LEFT now seems better. Also, we need to avoid collision with the body. Let's make sure that moving LEFT to (3,5) is safe. (3,5) is not part of the body, as the S's in row 3 are columns 1-3. So (3,5) is safe.\n\nAnother thing to check: after moving LEFT, the new head is (3,5), and the body shifts. The previous head (3,6) becomes S, and the tail (if no apple is eaten) is removed. The current snake's length: let's count the S's and H. H is 1, S's: let's count.\n\nRow 2: 3 S's (columns 1-3)\nRow 3: 3 S's (columns 1-3)\nRow 4: 2 S's (columns 1-2) + 1 S (column 6) → 3\nRow 5: 1 S (column 1) + 1 S (column 6) → 2\nRow 6: 6 S's (columns 1-6)\nTotal S's: 3+3+3+2+6 = 17. So the snake's length is 17 +1 (H) = 18. When moving, if no apple is eaten, the tail (the last S) is removed. So after moving LEFT, the head is (3,5), the body is the previous positions except the tail.\n\nBut regardless, the key is that the next position (3,5) is safe. So moving LEFT is a valid option.\n\nSo the best direction here is LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS  H#\n#SS A S#\n#S    S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 3, column 6), moving in the UP direction. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions to consider are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (3,6) leads to (3,7), which is a wall (`#`). This causes a collision, so RIGHT is invalid.  \n- **UP**: Moving up from (3,6) leads to (2,6). This position is empty (not a wall or snake body), so it is safe. However, there is no apple here.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (3,6) leads to (3,5). This position is empty (not a wall or snake body), so it is safe.  \n\nNext, evaluating long-term paths: The apple at (4,4) (row 4, column 4) is a key target. Moving LEFT to (3,5) positions the snake to eventually move left again to (3,4), then down to (4,4) (where the apple is). This path allows the snake to reach the apple in subsequent moves.  \n\nThus, the optimal direction is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided. \n\nThe board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' as walls. Let's list out each row to visualize the snake's position and the apples.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  AA  # → so positions (1,2) and (1,3) are apples (A)\nRow 2: #SSS   # → positions (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) are snake body (S)\nRow 3: #SSS HS# → Let's break this down. Columns 1-3: S, S, S. Then column 4: H (head). Column 5: S. So (3,1)=S, (3,2)=S, (3,3)=S, (3,4)=H, (3,5)=S\nRow 4: #S  A S# → (4,1)=S, (4,4)=A, (4,5)=S\nRow 5: #S    S# → (5,1)=S, (5,5)=S\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# → (6,1) to (6,6) are all S (since it's 6 S's between the #s)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left, which means the head (H) at (3,4) is going to move to (3,3) in the next step, unless the direction is changed. But the snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is LEFT, the snake can't immediately go RIGHT. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. Let's check what happens in each case.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the snake's body positions. The head is at (3,4). The body segments are all the S's. Let's list all S positions to track the snake's body:\n\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\nRow 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,5)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,5)\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,5)\nRow 6: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nWait, row 6 is #SSSSSS#. The columns between the # are 1 to 6. So (6,1) to (6,6) are S. That's 6 S's. So the snake is quite long, with the head at (3,4).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So the next position if moving LEFT would be (3,3). Let's check (3,3): it's S (from row 3: #SSS HS# → (3,3) is S). So if the snake moves LEFT into (3,3), the head would collide with its own body (since (3,3) is S). That's a collision, game over. So moving LEFT is bad.\n\nSo the snake can't continue LEFT. Now, possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. But can it turn to RIGHT? The current direction is LEFT. The rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. Reversing direction would be LEFT → RIGHT (since they are opposite). So turning RIGHT is not allowed. So possible directions are UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check UP direction. If the snake turns UP, the head (3,4) would move to (2,4). Let's check (2,4) on the board. Row 2 is #SSS   #. So columns 1-3 are S, columns 4-6 are empty (since it's \"   \"). So (2,4) is empty (not a wall, not S, not A). So moving UP to (2,4) is safe. Are there any apples there? Let's check row 1: #  AA  #. So row 1 has A at (1,2) and (1,3). (2,4) is in row 2, column 4. So (2,4) is empty. So moving UP would not eat an apple, but the snake would move there, and the body would follow. Since the snake's length is the number of S + H. Let's count the S's and H. H is 1, S's: let's count:\n\nRow 2: 3 S → 3\nRow 3: 4 S (positions 1,2,3,5) → 4\nRow 4: 2 S (1,5) → 2\nRow 5: 2 S (1,5) → 2\nRow 6: 6 S → 6\nTotal S: 3+4+2+2+6=17. So total length is 17 +1 (H) = 18. So when moving, the tail (the last S) would move if the snake doesn't eat an apple. But in this case, if moving UP to (2,4), which is empty, then the snake's head moves there, and the body follows, so the tail (probably the last S in the snake's body) would be removed. But since we don't have to track the tail movement, just check collision.\n\nNow check DOWN direction. Current head is at (3,4). Moving DOWN would take it to (4,4). Let's check (4,4): row 4 is #S  A S#. So column 4 in row 4 is A (since \"S  A S\" → positions 1: S, 2: empty, 3: empty, 4: A, 5: S). So (4,4) is an apple (A). So moving DOWN would make the head go to (4,4), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple increases the score and the snake grows. Now, check if (4,4) is a valid position (not a wall, not body). (4,4) is A, not a wall, and is it part of the snake's body? The snake's body is all the S's. (4,4) is A, so not S. So moving DOWN to (4,4) is safe, and the snake would eat the apple.\n\nWhat about collision? (4,4) is A, not a wall, and not S. So that's safe. So moving DOWN would result in eating an apple, which is good.\n\nSo possible directions: UP (safe, no apple), DOWN (safe, apple), RIGHT (invalid, reverse), LEFT (collision). So the best choice is DOWN, as it allows the snake to eat an apple and grow, which is better for the score.\n\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#SSS   #\n#SSS HS#\n#S  A S#\n#S    S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, and the snake's head is at (3,4). The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Moving LEFT would take the head to (3,3), which is occupied by the snake's body (S), causing a collision. Thus, LEFT is invalid. \n\nPossible directions are UP or DOWN. \n\n- **UP**: The head would move to (2,4), which is empty (no wall, no body, no apple). This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (4,4), which contains an apple (A). This is safe (no wall or body collision) and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing the snake.  \n\nThe optimal choice is DOWN, as it avoids collision and eats an apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list out each row to get the positions of the snake's head, body, apples, and walls.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  AA  # → columns 2 and 3 are apples (A)\nRow 2: #SSS   # → columns 1,2,3 are S (body)\nRow 3: #S S SS# → columns 1,3,5,6 are S\nRow 4: #S  AHS# → Let's check each column. Column 1: S, column 4: A, column 5: H (head), column 6: S. So positions (4,5) is the head.\nRow 5: #S    S# → columns 1 and 6 are S\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# → columns 1-6 are S (since 8 characters, first and last are #, so 1-6 are S)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. The head is at (4,5). Let's confirm the coordinates: rows are 0-7, columns 0-7. So (row, column) for the head is (4,5).\n\nThe snake moves one square at a time in the current direction. The next position if moving DOWN would be row 5, column 5. Let's check what's there. Looking at row 5: #S    S#. Columns 1 and 6 are S, so column 5 in row 5 is empty (since the row is # S [col1]  [col2] [col3] [col4] [col5]  [col6] S #. So row 5, columns 2-4 and 5 are empty? Let's parse row 5:\n\nRow 5: index 0 is #, 1 is S, 2 is space, 3 is space, 4 is space, 5 is space, 6 is S, 7 is #. So (5,5) is a space. So moving down from (4,5) to (5,5) would be a valid move (not a wall, not the snake's body). \n\nBut wait, the snake's body is all the S's. Let's list all S positions to check for collisions. The head is H at (4,5). The body S's are in:\n\nRow 1: no S (row 1 is #  AA  # → S not present)\nRow 2: columns 1,2,3 → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\nRow 3: columns 1,3,5,6 → (3,1), (3,3), (3,5), (3,6)\nRow 4: column 1,6 → (4,1), (4,6) (since row 4 is #S  AHS# → column 1 is S, column 6 is S)\nRow 5: column 1,6 → (5,1), (5,6)\nRow 6: columns 1-6 → (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSo the head is at (4,5). If moving DOWN (current direction), next position is (5,5). Let's check (5,5): is there an S there? Looking at row 5, (5,5) is a space (from the row 5: #S    S# → between S at (5,1) and S at (5,6), columns 2-5 are spaces. So (5,5) is empty. So moving down would be safe, but are there any apples there? The apples are in row 1: (1,2), (1,3) and row 4: (4,4) (since row 4 is #S  AHS# → column 4 is A). So (5,5) is not an apple. So moving down would not eat an apple, just move the head to (5,5), and the body would follow (since the snake's length is more than 1, the body parts shift). \n\nBut the player can change direction, but cannot reverse. The current direction is DOWN. The possible directions to change are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since reversing would be UP, which is not allowed). Because the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, no: the example says \"cannot reverse direction (i.e., cannot turn UP to DOWN or LEFT to RIGHT directly)\". So, if current direction is DOWN, the reverse is UP. So the snake can't turn to UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n\nSo possible next directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nWe need to choose a direction that avoids collision with walls or self, and preferably eat an apple.\n\nLet's check possible directions:\n\nCurrent head position (4,5).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. Let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. DOWN: next position (5,5). As before, (5,5) is empty. Safe. No apple here.\n\n2. LEFT: direction is LEFT. So next position is (4,4). Let's check (4,4). Row 4 is #S  AHS# → column 4 is A (apple). So (4,4) is A. So moving LEFT would take the head to (4,4), which is an apple. That's good, because eating the apple would increase the score and the snake grows. Also, need to check if (4,4) is part of the snake's body. The body S's: (4,1) and (4,6) are S. (4,4) is A, so not S. So moving LEFT would be safe and eat an apple.\n\n3. RIGHT: direction is RIGHT. Next position (4,6). Let's check (4,6). Row 4 is #S  AHS# → column 6 is S (body part). So (4,6) is S. So moving RIGHT would collide with the snake's own body. That's a game over. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo options:\n\n- DOWN: safe, no apple.\n\n- LEFT: safe, eat apple (A at (4,4)).\n\n- RIGHT: collision, game over.\n\nSo the best choice is LEFT. Because moving LEFT would eat the apple, which is beneficial. Let's confirm.\n\nHead is at (4,5). Direction LEFT: next position is (4,5-1) = (4,4). Which is A. So that's correct. So the snake would eat the apple, grow, and the score increases. And (4,4) is not part of the body (since body in row 4 is (4,1) and (4,6)), so no collision.\n\nSo the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  AA  #\n#SSS   #\n#S S SS#\n#S  AHS#\n#S    S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4,5) (row 4, column 5), and the current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. \n\n- **Moving DOWN**: The next head position would be (5,5). Checking row 5, (5,5) is empty (no wall or body), so this is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The next head position would be (4,6). Row 4, column 6 is 'S' (snake's body), so this would cause a collision and end the game.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The next head position would be (4,4). Row 4, column 4 is 'A' (an apple). This position is not occupied by the snake's body, so it is safe and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing the snake.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move LEFT, as it safely eats an apple without collision. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #  AA  # (so positions (1,2) and (1,3) are apples 'A')\nRow 2: #SSSA  # (positions (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) are 'S', (2,4) is 'A')\nRow 3: #S S SS# (positions (3,1): 'S', (3,3): 'S', (3,4): 'S', (3,5): 'S')\nRow 4: #S  HSS# (positions (4,1): 'S', (4,4): 'H' (head), (4,5): 'S', (4,6): 'S')\nRow 5: #S    S# (positions (5,1): 'S', (5,6): 'S')\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# (positions (6,1) to (6,6) are 'S')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. The head 'H' is at (4,4) (since rows are 0-7, columns 0-7). Moving left would take it to (4,3). Let's check what's there. Looking at row 4: \"#S  HSS#\", so positions (4,0) is '#', (4,1) is 'S', (4,2) is ' ', (4,3) is ' ', (4,4) is 'H', (4,5) is 'S', (4,6) is 'S', (4,7) is '#'. Wait, maybe I need to index correctly. Let's list each row's columns properly.\n\nRow 1: indexes 0 to 7: [0]'#', [1]' ', [2]' ', [3]'A', [4]'A', [5]' ', [6]' ', [7]'#'\nRow 2: [0]'#', [1]'S', [2]'S', [3]'S', [4]'A', [5]' ', [6]' ', [7]'#'\nRow 3: [0]'#', [1]'S', [2]' ', [3]'S', [4]'S', [5]'S', [6]' ', [7]'#'\nRow 4: [0]'#', [1]'S', [2]' ', [3]' ', [4]'H', [5]'S', [6]'S', [7]'#'  (Ah, right, so H is at (4,4). So (row, column) = (4,4).)\nCurrent direction is LEFT, so moving left would mean the next head position is (4,3) (since column decreases by 1). Let's check (4,3): in row 4, column 3 is ' ' (from \"#S  HSS#\" — positions 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', etc. So (4,3) is empty. So moving left would be possible. But wait, the snake's body parts are 'S's. Let's check if moving left would hit the body. The head is at (4,4). The next position is (4,3). What's (4,3)? From row 4: it's ' ', so no collision with body. What about walls? The walls are at column 0 and 7. (4,3) is column 3, so not a wall. So moving left is possible.\n\nBut the problem is, the snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is LEFT. So possible directions to turn are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT (since reversing would be RIGHT, which is not allowed). So the possible directions the player can choose are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Because if current direction is LEFT, you can't go RIGHT (reverse). So the options are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nNow, we need to see which direction is safe and can lead to eating apples. Let's check the positions of apples. Apples are 'A's. Let's list all 'A's on the board:\n\nRow 1: columns 3 and 4 (positions (1,3), (1,4))\nRow 2: column 4 (position (2,4))\n\nSo three apples.\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,4). Let's see possible moves:\n\nIf we go LEFT (current direction), next head is (4,3). Is that an apple? No. (4,3) is ' ' (empty). Then, since it's not an apple, the snake's tail would move (since length doesn't increase). The snake's body is made of 'S's. The movement would be: head moves to (4,3), and the tail (the last 'S') would be removed. But we need to check if the new head position (4,3) is safe. Let's check if (4,3) is a wall or body. Walls are at column 0 and 7, so (4,3) is column 3, not a wall. Body parts are 'S's. Let's check (4,3): in row 4, column 3 is ' ', so no collision. So moving left is safe.\n\nIf we go UP: current direction is LEFT, so UP is allowed (not reverse). Moving UP would mean the head moves from (4,4) to (3,4). Let's check (3,4). Looking at row 3: \"#S S SS#\". Columns: 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (3,4) is 'S' (body part). So moving UP would make the head collide with the body. That's a game over. So UP is invalid.\n\nIf we go DOWN: current direction is LEFT, so DOWN is allowed (not reverse). Moving DOWN would take the head from (4,4) to (5,4). Let's check row 5: \"#S    S#\". Columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: 'S', 7: '#'. So (5,4) is ' ' (empty). So (5,4) is safe. No collision with body or walls.\n\nIf we go RIGHT: but that's reverse of current direction (LEFT → RIGHT is reverse), which is not allowed. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT, DOWN. Now, which of these is better? Let's check if moving in these directions can reach apples.\n\nCurrent apples are at (1,3), (1,4), (2,4). Let's see the positions.\n\nHead is at (4,4). Let's think about the snake's body. The body is a chain of 'S's. Let's try to trace the snake's body to know the direction it's moving. Since the current direction is LEFT, the head was moving left. The previous positions would be: the head was at (4,5) before moving to (4,4), because moving left (from (4,5) to (4,4)), which would make (4,5) part of the body (since the snake's length is more than 1). Let's confirm:\n\nLooking at row 4: \"#S  HSS#\" → H is at (4,4), and (4,5) and (4,6) are 'S's. So the body is (4,5), (4,6), and then other 'S's in lower rows. For example, row 6 is all 'S's from (6,1) to (6,6). So the snake is quite long.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT to (4,3), then the next position. Then, perhaps next moves can reach apples. But let's see the apple positions. The closest apple is (2,4). The head is at (4,4). To reach (2,4), the snake would need to move up. But moving up from (4,4) would take it to (3,4), which is 'S' (body), so that's blocked. So (2,4) is in row 2, column 4.\n\nAnother apple is (1,3) and (1,4). (1,4) is in row 1, column 4. To get there, the snake would need to go up multiple times, but the path is blocked by body.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4). Then, the next head position is (5,4). Let's check (5,4): it's empty. Then, moving further directions. Let's see the path. If the snake moves down, next possible moves could be down again (if possible) or left\/right (but direction can't reverse). Let's see if (5,4) is safe. Yes.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN, which is safer? Let's check possible collisions in the next steps.\n\nIf we choose LEFT: next head at (4,3). Then, the next move direction could be LEFT again (to (4,2)), or UP (to (3,3)), or DOWN (to (5,3)). Let's check (4,2): in row 4, column 2 is ' ', so safe. (3,3): row 3, column 3 is 'S' (from \"#S S SS#\": (3,3) is 'S'), so moving UP from (4,3) to (3,3) would hit body. (5,3): row 5, column 3 is ' ', so safe.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: next head at (5,4). Then, possible directions are DOWN (to (6,4)), LEFT (to (5,3)), or UP (to (4,4) which is now part of the body, since the head was there before). Wait, after moving down, the head is at (5,4), and the previous head (4,4) becomes part of the body. So (4,4) is now 'S'. So moving UP from (5,4) would take to (4,4), which is 'S' (body), collision. So directions from (5,4) can be DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (but RIGHT is reverse of current direction, which was LEFT. Wait, the current direction after moving down would be DOWN. Because the direction input is the new direction. Wait, no: the direction the snake is moving is the direction input. The current direction is LEFT, but if we input DOWN, then the new direction is DOWN. So when the snake moves, the direction is the one we choose. So when we choose DOWN, the snake's direction becomes DOWN, and moves one step in that direction.\n\nSo, when we input DOWN, the direction becomes DOWN, and the head moves from (4,4) to (5,4). That's valid. Then, in the next step, the direction can be DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (since the current direction would be DOWN, so can't reverse to UP).\n\nBut back to the current decision: which direction (LEFT or DOWN) is better to avoid collision and reach apples.\n\nLet's check if moving LEFT would lead to any immediate problem. (4,3) is safe. Then, after that, the snake can continue moving left, perhaps towards row 4, column 2, then 1. But row 4, column 1 is 'S' (from \"#S  HSS#\": (4,1) is 'S'). So if the snake moves left to (4,3), then left again to (4,2), then left again to (4,1), which is 'S' (body). So that would be a collision. So moving left multiple times could hit the body at (4,1).\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,4): (5,4) is empty. Then, moving down again to (6,4). Row 6 is \"#SSSSSS#\", so (6,4) is 'S' (body). So moving down again would hit (6,4), which is body. So that's a problem. Alternatively, from (5,4), moving LEFT to (5,3): which is ' ', safe. Then, moving LEFT again to (5,2): ' ', safe. Then, (5,1) is 'S' (from row 5: \"#S    S#\": (5,1) is 'S'). So that's a body.\n\nHmm. So both directions have possible future collisions, but perhaps in the current step, both are safe. But maybe there's another consideration: are there any apples in the direction of movement?\n\nThe apples are at (1,3), (1,4), (2,4). Let's see the positions relative to the head (4,4). The apple at (2,4) is two rows up (row 2) from head (row 4). To reach there, the snake would need to move up. But (3,4) is 'S' (body), so that's blocked. The apple at (1,4) is even higher. The apple at (1,3) is row 1, column 3. So if the snake moves left to (4,3), then up to (3,3) (but (3,3) is 'S'), so that's blocked. Alternatively, moving left to (4,3), then left to (4,2), then up to (3,2). Let's check (3,2): row 3 is \"#S S SS#\", so (3,2) is ' ', safe. Then (3,2) is empty. Then from (3,2), up to (2,2). Row 2: \"#SSSA  #\", (2,2) is 'S' (body). So that's a collision. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,4), then right (but direction can't reverse if current direction is DOWN. If direction is DOWN, next direction can be DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. So if after moving down, the direction is DOWN, then moving right (direction RIGHT) is allowed. Let's say from (5,4), direction RIGHT: then the head moves to (5,5). Row 5: \"#S    S#\", (5,5) is ' ', safe. Then (5,5) is empty. Then, (5,6) is 'S' (body), so moving right again would hit (5,6).\n\nHmm. Maybe neither direction leads to an apple immediately. But perhaps we need to choose the direction that avoids collision in the next step. Let's check the current possible moves again.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. UP is invalid (hits body). So options are LEFT and DOWN.\n\nMoving LEFT: head to (4,3). Safe. Next move directions would be LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nMoving DOWN: head to (5,4). Safe. Next move directions would be DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nSo both are safe. But perhaps the snake is long, and the tail is moving. Let's think about the snake's body structure. The snake's body is a chain. Since the current direction is LEFT, the snake's movement is such that each 'S' follows the head. The head is at (4,4). The next part of the body is (4,5), then (4,6). Then looking at row 6: \"#SSSSSS#\", so (6,1) to (6,6) are 'S's. Row 5: \"#S    S#\", (5,1) and (5,6) are 'S's. Row 4 has (4,1) as 'S'. Row 3 has (3,1), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) as 'S's. Row 2 has (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) as 'S's. So the snake is forming a kind of loop or filled area. The head is in row 4, column 4, and the body is surrounding it. So the available spaces are limited.\n\nThe empty spaces (other than apples) are:\n\nRow 1: columns 1,2,5,6 (but (1,3) and (1,4) are apples)\nRow 2: columns 5,6 (since (2,1-3) are 'S', (2,4) is 'A')\nRow 3: column 2,6 (since (3,1), (3,3-5) are 'S')\nRow4: columns 2,3 (since (4,1), (4,4-6) are 'S' or 'H')\nRow5: columns 2,3,4,5 (since (5,1), (5,6) are 'S')\nRow6: no empty spaces (all 'S's)\n\nSo the available empty spaces are in row 1 (some), row 2 (some), row 3 (column 2,6), row4 (columns 2,3), row5 (columns 2-5). \n\nThe head is at (4,3) if moving left. (4,3) is in row4, column3. That's an empty space. Then, the next move could be to row4, column2 (empty), then row3, column2 (empty), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,4) (row5, column4) which is empty, then row5, column3 (empty), row5, column2 (empty), etc.\n\nBut the main thing is to avoid collision. Since both LEFT and DOWN are safe, but the question is which direction to choose. However, perhaps there's a better option. Let me double-check the current head position and possible moves.\n\nWait, the head is at (4,4). Current direction is LEFT, so moving left would be (4,3). Let's confirm the cell (4,3) again. Row4 is \"#S  HSS#\". Let's index each character:\n\nRow4: index 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'\n\nYes, (4,3) is ' ', safe.\n\nMoving UP from (4,4) would be (3,4). Row3 is \"#S S SS#\". Let's index row3:\n\nRow3: 0:'#', 1:'S', 2:' ', 3:'S', 4:'S', 5:'S', 6:' ', 7:'#'\n\nSo (3,4) is 'S' (body), collision. So UP is invalid.\n\nMoving DOWN from (4,4) is (5,4). Row5: \"#S    S#\".\n\nRow5: 0:'#', 1:'S', 2:' ', 3:' ', 4:' ', 5:' ', 6:'S', 7:'#'\n\nSo (5,4) is ' ', safe.\n\nMoving RIGHT (reverse) is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT and DOWN. Which one is better? Let's see if either direction leads to an apple in the next step. The apples are at (1,3), (1,4), (2,4). The head is at (4,4). Moving LEFT to (4,3): no apple. Moving DOWN to (5,4): no apple. So neither direction gets an apple now. So the choice is between two safe directions.\n\nBut perhaps the snake's body is such that one direction has more space. Let's think about the snake's body movement. Since the snake is moving, the tail (the end of the body) will move forward, freeing up space. But without knowing the exact tail position, it's hard to tell. However, given the current board, the snake is quite long, so the available space is limited.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better direction that I'm missing. Let me check again.\n\nAnother angle: the snake's current direction is LEFT. The player can choose to continue moving LEFT, or turn UP or DOWN. UP is invalid (collision). So the options are LEFT and DOWN. Both are safe. But perhaps one of them is more likely to lead to an apple in the future.\n\nThe apple at (2,4) is in row 2, column 4. The head is at (4,4). To reach (2,4), the snake would need to move up twice. But (3,4) is 'S', so that's blocked. So that apple is inaccessible.\n\nThe apples at (1,3) and (1,4) are in row 1. To reach them, the snake would need to go up multiple times, but the path is blocked by body.\n\nThe apple at (2,4) is in row 2, column 4. The row 2, column 4 is 'A' (from row 2: \"#SSSA  #\", so (2,4) is 'A'). So (2,4) is an apple. The head is at (4,4). The path from (4,4) to (2,4) is (4,4) → (3,4) → (2,4). But (3,4) is 'S' (body), so can't go through there.\n\nSo those apples are blocked. Are there any other apples? The problem states that there are 3 apples initially, and the current board has three 'A's: (1,3), (1,4), (2,4). So those are all.\n\nSo none of the apples are reachable in the next move, but we need to choose a direction that doesn't cause collision. Since both LEFT and DOWN are safe, but perhaps one of them is better. Let's see if moving LEFT would lead to a dead end sooner. For example, moving LEFT to (4,3) → then LEFT to (4,2) → then LEFT to (4,1), which is 'S' (body), collision. So that's three steps.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,4) → then DOWN to (6,4), which is 'S' (body), collision. So that's two steps. So moving LEFT allows more steps before collision. So perhaps moving LEFT is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN is better. But the question is, which direction is the correct answer here. Since the problem requires to output one of the directions, and both are possible, but perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, let's recheck the row 3, column 4. Row3: \"#S S SS#\". Let's split the row into characters:\n\nIndex 0: '#'\nIndex 1: 'S'\nIndex 2: ' '\nIndex 3: 'S'\nIndex 4: 'S'\nIndex 5: 'S'\nIndex 6: ' '\nIndex 7: '#'\n\nSo (3,4) is index 4 → 'S', correct. So moving up from (4,4) to (3,4) is collision.\n\nRow 5, column 4: (5,4) is index 4 of row5: \"#S    S#\". The row5 is:\n\n0: '#'\n1: 'S'\n2: ' '\n3: ' '\n4: ' '\n5: ' '\n6: 'S'\n7: '#'\n\nSo (5,4) is ' ', correct. So moving down to (5,4) is safe.\n\nSo the possible directions are LEFT and DOWN. Since the problem says to choose one, perhaps the intended answer is LEFT, as the current direction is LEFT, and there's no immediate danger. Alternatively, perhaps there's another factor I missed.\n\nWait, perhaps the snake's body is arranged such that moving LEFT would not hit the body. Let's think about the snake's movement. The snake's head is at (4,4), moving LEFT. The body segments are behind it. The next segment would be where the head was previously. Since the current direction is LEFT, the previous head position was (4,5) (since moving left from (4,5) to (4,4)), so (4,5) is part of the body. Then (4,6) is the next segment, and so on. So the body is (4,5), (4,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (5,6) — maybe. So the body is a long chain. So the head is at (4,4), and the body is in all those positions.\n\nSo when moving LEFT to (4,3), is that position part of the body? No, because (4,3) is ' ' in the current board. So that's safe. Moving DOWN to (5,4) is also ' ', safe.\n\nSo, since both directions are safe, but the problem requires to choose one, perhaps the answer is LEFT, as the current direction, and there's no reason to change. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is DOWN. But I need to make a choice. Since the problem says to output the direction, and the options are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, and RIGHT and UP are invalid, the possible answers are LEFT or DOWN.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the current board again.\n\nThe game board is:\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: #  AA  # → columns 2 and 3 are spaces, 3 and 4 are A's (columns 3 and 4)\nRow 2: #SSSA  # → columns 1-3 are S, column 4 is A, 5-6 are spaces\nRow 3: #S S SS# → column 1: S, column 3: S, columns 4-5: S\nRow 4: #S  HSS# → column 1: S, columns 4: H, 5-6: S\nRow 5: #S    S# → column 1: S, column 6: S\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# → columns 1-6: S\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo the head (H) is at (4,4). Let's list all positions:\n\nH is at (row=4, column=4).\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT. So the next head position if moving LEFT is (4,3).\n\nCheck (4,3): row 4, column 3 is ' ' (since row4 is \"#S  HSS#\", which is:\n\ncolumns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'\n\nYes, (4,3) is ' '.\n\nMoving LEFT is safe. Moving DOWN is also safe. Since there's no apple in either direction, but the problem requires to choose, perhaps the answer is LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#SSSA  #\n#S S SS#\n#S  HSS#\n#S    S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 4, column 4).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., to RIGHT).\n- **Valid Moves**: Possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (RIGHT is invalid as it reverses the current direction).\n- **Collision Checks**:\n  - **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 3, column 4). Row 3 at column 4 is 'S' (snake body), causing a collision. UP is invalid.\n  - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (row 5, column 4). Row 5 at column 4 is empty (' '), so no collision. DOWN is safe.\n  - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 4, column 3). Row 4 at column 3 is empty (' '), so no collision. LEFT is safe.\n\n### Decision:\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are safe, but LEFT continues the current direction without immediate risk. Since no apples are directly in the path of either move, the safest choice is to maintain the current direction to avoid unnecessary turns that might lead to collisions in subsequent steps.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position and direction. \n\nThe current direction is LEFT, and the snake can't reverse direction, so it can't go RIGHT immediately. The possible directions to choose from are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since RIGHT is the reverse of LEFT). Wait, wait, the rules say the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is LEFT, the reverse would be RIGHT. So the allowed directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. Because reversing is not allowed. So the possible next directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, let's look at the game board. Let's parse it row by row. The board is 8x8, with walls as #. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  AA  # → columns 2 and 3 are A (since positions 1 is #, then 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: #)\nRow 2: #SSSA  # → columns 1 is #, then 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 5:A, 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 3: #S   SS# → columns 1:S, 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5:S, 6:S, 7: #\nRow 4: #S HSSS# → columns 1:S, 2: ' ', 3:H (head), 4:S, 5:S, 6:S, 7: # → Wait, let's check each position. Let's index rows from 0 to 7, columns 0 to 7. So row 4, column 3 is H. Because the row is \"#S HSSS#\", so positions are: 0 is #, 1 is S, 2 is ' ', 3 is H, 4 is S, 5 is S, 6 is S, 7 is #. So the head (H) is at (4,3). \n\nRow 5: #S    S# → columns 1:S, 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6:S, 7: #\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# → columns 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S, 7: #\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe snake's body is made of S's. The head is at (4,3). Let's track the snake's body segments. Since the snake moves in LEFT direction, the next head position would be (4,3-1) = (4,2) if moving LEFT. But we need to check if that's a valid position (not wall, not body).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. Let's think about where the head is now (4,3). Let's check possible next moves:\n\nPossible directions: LEFT (current direction), UP, DOWN. Because RIGHT is reverse, so not allowed.\n\nFirst, check moving LEFT: new head position (4,2). What's in (4,2)? Looking at row 4: \"#S HSSS#\", so column 2 is ' ' (since row 4 is [0]# [1]S [2] [3]H [4]S [5]S [6]S [7]#). So (4,2) is empty (a space). So moving LEFT here would be possible. But wait, is there a body part there? Let's check all S positions. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: columns 2-3 are ' ' and ' ', 4-5 are A's. So row 1 has no S.\n\nRow 2: #SSSA  # → columns 2,3,4 are S, S, S. So (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) are S.\n\nRow 3: #S   SS# → column 1 is S (3,1), columns 5 and 6 are S (3,5), (3,6).\n\nRow 4: #S HSSS# → column 1 is S (4,1), columns 4,5,6 are S (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n\nRow 5: #S    S# → column 1 is S (5,1), column 6 is S (5,6).\n\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# → columns 1-6 are S: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nSo (4,2) is a space (no S, no A, no wall). So moving LEFT would take the head to (4,2), which is safe. The next position would be (4,2). Then, the body would follow. But since the snake's length is determined by how many apples it's eaten. Let's see, the initial length is 1. Each apple increases length by 1. The current board has apples (A) in row 1 (columns 4 and 5), row 2 (column 5). So let's count how many apples are left. The problem states that the game starts with 3 apples. Let's check the current board:\n\nRow 1: #  AA  # → two A's (columns 4 and 5)\nRow 2: #SSSA  # → one A (column 5)\nRow 3: #S   SS# → no A\nRow 4: #S HSSS# → no A\nRow 5: #S    S# → no A\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# → no A\nSo total apples now are 2 + 1 = 3. So the snake hasn't eaten any apples yet (since initial 3 apples are still there). So the snake's current length is 1? No, wait, the initial length is 1. Each time it eats an apple, length increases. But the snake's body is made of S's. Let's count the S's on the board. Let's count all S's:\n\nRow 2: 3 S's (columns 2,3,4)\nRow 3: 1 (column 1) + 2 (columns 5,6) → 3 S's\nRow 4: 1 (column 1) + 3 (columns 4,5,6) → 4 S's\nRow 5: 1 (column 1) + 1 (column 6) → 2 S's\nRow 6: 6 S's (columns 1-6)\nTotal S's: 3 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 6 = 18. So the snake's length is 18 + 1 (the head) = 19? Because the head is H, and the body is S's. So the length is 19. So each time it moves, the body follows. When moving, the head moves to a new position, and the tail (last S) is removed unless an apple is eaten (then the tail stays, increasing length). \n\nBut the main thing is collision. Let's check possible directions:\n\n1. Moving LEFT: new head position (4,2). Is that a wall? No, row 4, column 2 is ' ' (not a #). Is it a body (S)? Let's check all S positions. The S positions are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,5), (3,6), (4,1), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,1), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (4,2) is not in this list, so no collision. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\n2. Moving UP: direction is UP. The new head position would be (4-1,3) = (3,3). Let's check (3,3). Row 3 is \"#S   SS#\", which is [0]#, [1]S, [2] ' ', [3] ' ', [4] ' ', [5]S, [6]S, [7]#. So (3,3) is ' ' (empty). Is that a body part? The S positions are as listed. (3,3) is not an S, so safe. So moving UP to (3,3) is possible.\n\n3. Moving DOWN: direction is DOWN. New head position (4+1,3) = (5,3). Check row 5: \"#S    S#\", which is [0]#, [1]S, [2] ' ', [3] ' ', [4] ' ', [5] ' ', [6]S, [7]#. So (5,3) is ' ' (empty). Check if it's a body. (5,3) is not in the S positions list. So moving DOWN to (5,3) is safe.\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's check where the apples are. Apples are in row 1 (columns 4 and 5), row 2 (column 5). Let's list apple positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5).\n\nWe need to see if any of the possible next moves (LEFT, UP, DOWN) would lead the head to an apple.\n\nCurrent head is at (4,3). Let's check each possible direction:\n\n- LEFT: (4,2) → no apple here. The apples are at (1,4), (1,5), (2,5). So (4,2) is not an apple.\n\n- UP: (3,3). No apple there. (3,3) is ' '.\n\n- DOWN: (5,3). Also ' '.\n\nSo none of the immediate next moves will eat an apple. So we need to choose a direction that leads towards the apples without colliding.\n\nLet's think about the snake's current path. The current direction is LEFT. If we continue LEFT, the head moves to (4,2). Then, the next move (epoch 44) direction could be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again (can't reverse to RIGHT). Let's see where the apples are. The apples are in row 1, which is above. So maybe moving UP would be better to get closer to the apples.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if any of the directions would lead to a collision in the next steps. Let's see the current body structure. The snake is quite long, filling row 6 (all S's), row 5 has S at (5,1) and (5,6), row 4 has S at (4,1), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), row 3 has S at (3,1), (3,5), (3,6), row 2 has S at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). The head is at (4,3). The snake's body is arranged in a way that perhaps the head is in the middle of the body.\n\nIf we move UP to (3,3), then next possible directions could be UP, LEFT, or DOWN (since current direction would be UP, so can't reverse to DOWN). Wait, if the next direction after moving UP is UP, then the head would go to (2,3). Let's check (2,3): row 2 is \"#SSSA  #\", which is (2,2)=S, (2,3)=S, (2,4)=S, (2,5)=A. Oh! (2,3) is S (body). So if we move UP to (3,3) (current move), then next move if we go UP again, head would be at (2,3), which is S. That's a collision. So moving UP might lead to a collision in the next step.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (4,2), next possible directions could be UP, DOWN, LEFT. Let's see (4,2) is safe. Then, moving LEFT again would take us to (4,1). (4,1) is S (from row 4: \"#S HSSS#\", column 1 is S). So (4,1) is a body part. So moving LEFT again would cause a collision. So if we go LEFT now, next move can't be LEFT again (since (4,1) is S). So possible directions after LEFT would be UP or DOWN.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (5,3), then next direction could be UP, DOWN, or LEFT. Let's check (5,3) is safe. Then, moving DOWN again would take us to (6,3). Row 6 is \"#SSSSSS#\", so (6,3) is S. So that's a collision. So moving DOWN again would be bad.\n\nSo let's evaluate each direction's next steps:\n\nCurrent possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nOption 1: Move LEFT → new head (4,2). Next possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT (but LEFT would go to (4,1), which is S → collision). So next move can't be LEFT. So possible directions: UP or DOWN.\n\nIf next move is UP from (4,2), new head (3,2). Check (3,2): row 3 is \"#S   SS#\", column 2 is ' ' → safe. Then, perhaps moving towards row 2 where there's an apple (2,5).\n\nOption 2: Move UP → new head (3,3). Next possible directions: UP (to (2,3) which is S → collision), LEFT (to (3,2) → safe), DOWN (to (4,3) which was the previous head position, but after moving, the body would have shifted. Wait, when the snake moves, the body follows. So the previous head (4,3) becomes S, and the tail (the last S) is removed unless an apple is eaten. Since no apple was eaten, the tail is removed. So the body's positions change each move.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think about the immediate safety. All three directions (LEFT, UP, DOWN) are safe for the current move. Since the goal is to eat apples, we need to find a path towards the apples.\n\nThe apples are at (1,4), (1,5), (2,5). The head is at (4,3). To reach those apples, the head needs to move upwards (since they are in row 1 and 2) and to the right (since columns 4 and 5 are to the right of column 3).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT (so moving left, column decreases). To reach the apples (columns 4,5), the snake needs to turn right eventually. But since the current direction is LEFT, the snake can't reverse to RIGHT immediately. So the snake must first change direction to UP or DOWN, then possibly turn RIGHT.\n\nIf the snake moves UP now (to (3,3)), then in the next move, the direction could be RIGHT (since the current direction would be UP, and RIGHT is not the reverse of UP. The reverse of UP is DOWN, so from UP, allowed directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Oh wait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So reversing is when the new direction is the opposite. So if current direction is UP, the reverse is DOWN, so you can't go from UP to DOWN. But you can go from UP to LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. Similarly, current direction is LEFT, reverse is RIGHT. So from LEFT, allowed directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nSo if the snake moves UP now (direction changes from LEFT to UP), then next direction can be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since reverse of UP is DOWN, so can't go to DOWN). Wait, no: the current direction after moving UP would be UP, so the next direction can't be DOWN (reverse). So allowed directions would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nAh, that's a key point. So when you change direction, the new direction becomes the current direction for the next move. So if you move UP now, the current direction for the next epoch is UP. So next move, you can't reverse (can't go DOWN). So allowed directions would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nSo if the snake moves UP now (to (3,3)), then in the next move, if it turns RIGHT (direction RIGHT), that's allowed (since current direction is UP, reverse is DOWN, so RIGHT is allowed). Then the head would move RIGHT (column increases by 1) from (3,3) to (3,4). Let's check (3,4): row 3 is \"#S   SS#\", column 4 is ' ' (since row 3 has S at column 1, 5, 6). So (3,4) is safe. Then, moving RIGHT again could take the head towards column 5, where there's an apple in row 2 (2,5).\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3), then RIGHT to (3,4), then RIGHT to (3,5). (3,5) is S (row 3, column 5 is S). So that's a collision. So (3,5) is S. So can't go to (3,5) in that case.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,3), then UP to (2,3). (2,3) is S (row 2, column 3 is S). So collision. So moving UP from (3,3) to (2,3) is bad.\n\nHmm. Let's think of another approach. The snake is currently in row 4, column 3. The apples are in row 1 (columns 4,5) and row 2 (column 5). The snake needs to get to those positions. Let's see the path.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT to (4,2), then next direction could be UP (current direction would be LEFT, so next direction can be UP, DOWN, LEFT. If we go UP, direction becomes UP, then next direction can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT). From (4,2), moving UP to (3,2). Then from (3,2), direction could be RIGHT (since current direction is UP, reverse is DOWN, so RIGHT is allowed). Then moving RIGHT to (3,3), then RIGHT to (3,4), then RIGHT to (3,5) (which is S, so collision). Alternatively, from (3,2), moving UP to (2,2). (2,2) is S (row 2, column 2 is S). So collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,3). Then, direction is DOWN. Next move could be RIGHT (since from DOWN, reverse is UP, so allowed directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). So from (5,3), moving RIGHT to (5,4). (5,4) is ' ' (row 5: \"#S    S#\", column 4 is ' '). Then moving RIGHT to (5,5) (also ' '), then RIGHT to (5,6) which is S (row 5, column 6 is S). So collision.\n\nThis is tricky. All directions seem to have possible collisions in the next steps, but the current move is safe. Since the game hasn't ended yet (epoch 43, 100 total), we need to choose a direction that allows the snake to survive and possibly reach an apple.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's body is very long, filling the bottom rows (row 6 is all S, row 5 has S on the edges). The head is in row 4. The upper rows (row 1 and 2) have apples and some S's. The snake's body in row 2 is columns 2-4 (SSS) and column 5 is A. So (2,5) is an apple. If the snake can reach (2,5), that's an apple. Let's see the path to (2,5).\n\nHead is at (4,3). To reach (2,5), need to move up twice (to row 2) and right twice (to column 5). Let's see:\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So first move: can't go RIGHT. So first move must be UP, DOWN, or LEFT. Let's say we choose UP. Then head moves to (3,3). Then, direction is UP. Next move can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT. If we choose RIGHT (direction RIGHT), then head moves to (3,4). Then direction is RIGHT. Next move can be RIGHT, UP, DOWN (since reverse of RIGHT is LEFT). Then head moves to (3,5). But (3,5) is S (row 3, column 5 is S). So collision. So that path is bad.\n\nAlternative path: first move UP to (3,3), then UP to (2,3). But (2,3) is S (row 2, column 3 is S). Collision. So no.\n\nAnother path: first move LEFT to (4,2). Then direction is LEFT. Next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT. If we move UP to (3,2). Then direction is UP. Next move can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Then move RIGHT to (3,3). Then direction is RIGHT. Next move to (3,4). Then direction RIGHT again to (3,5) (S, collision).\n\nAlternatively, from (4,2), move DOWN to (5,2). Then direction is DOWN. Then move RIGHT to (5,3). Then RIGHT to (5,4). Then RIGHT to (5,5). Then RIGHT to (5,6) (S, collision).\n\nHmm. What about moving LEFT now, then LEFT again? But (4,1) is S (row 4, column 1 is S). So that's a collision, so can't.\n\nAlternatively, the snake is surrounded by its own body. Maybe the best option is to continue moving LEFT, since that's the current direction, and see if there's a path. But (4,2) is safe. Let's choose LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#SSSA  #\n#S   SS#\n#S HSSS#\n#S    S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible next directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\n- **Moving LEFT**: The head (at (4,3)) would move to (4,2). Checking (4,2) on the board: it is an empty space (no wall or body collision). This move is safe.  \n- **Moving UP**: The head would move to (3,3). (3,3) is an empty space (no collision). This move is safe.  \n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (5,3). (5,3) is an empty space (no collision). This move is safe.  \n\nNone of the immediate moves lead to an apple, but the goal is to avoid collisions and navigate toward apples. The apples are in row 1 (columns 4-5) and row 2 (column 5). Continuing LEFT keeps the snake moving in its current direction, which is safe for this step. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. Apples are 'A'. The current direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 44 (so 56 epochs left before the game ends at 100). The snake can't reverse direction, so from LEFT, it can't go RIGHT immediately. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed).\n\nFirst, let's map out the positions of the snake's head and body. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  AA  # (columns 2 and 3 are A, others are spaces or wall)\nRow 2: #SS A  # (columns 1,2 are S; column 4 is A)\nRow 3: #S   SS# (columns 1 is S; columns 5,6 are S)\nRow 4: #SHSSSS# (columns 1 is S, 2 is H, 3-6 are S)\nRow 5: #S    S# (columns 1 is S; column 6 is S)\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# (columns 1-6 are S)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is in row 4, column 2 (since rows are 0-indexed, row 4 is the fifth line). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 4: index 0 is '#', 1 is 'S', 2 is 'H', 3 is 'S', 4 is 'S', 5 is 'S', 6 is 'S', 7 is '#'. So H is at (4,2).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, so the snake is moving left. Let's see where the next position would be if it continues LEFT. Moving left from (4,2) would take it to (4,1). Let's check what's there. Looking at row 4, column 1 is 'S' (from the row 4: #SHSSSS# → index 1 is S). So if the snake moves LEFT (to (4,1)), it would collide with its own body (since that's an 'S'). That's a collision, which ends the game. So moving LEFT is bad.\n\nNext, possible directions are UP or DOWN (since RIGHT is reverse of LEFT and not allowed). Let's check each.\n\nFirst, direction UP: moving up from (4,2) would take the head to (3,2). Let's check row 3: #S   SS#. The columns are 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'. So (3,2) is a space (empty). So moving UP would take the head to (3,2), which is safe. Then, the snake's body would follow. Let's check if that's a valid move. No collision with walls (since row 3 is within 0-7) and the new position is empty (no S or #), so that's safe.\n\nNow direction DOWN: moving down from (4,2) would take the head to (5,2). Let's check row 5: #S    S#. Columns: 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: 'S', 7: '#'. So (5,2) is a space. So moving DOWN would take the head to (5,2), which is also a space. That's safe.\n\nNow, check if there are apples in the possible next positions. The apples are in row 1, columns 2 and 3 (A's), row 2, column 4 (A), and any others? Let's recheck:\n\nRow 1: #  AA  # → columns 2 and 3 (indices 2,3) are A.\nRow 2: #SS A  # → column 4 (index 4) is A.\nAny other A's? The other rows (3,4,5,6) don't have A's except those. So the apples are at (1,2), (1,3), (2,4).\n\nThe current head is at (4,2). Let's see the next positions:\n\nIf moving UP to (3,2): is there an apple there? (3,2) is in row 3, column 2. Looking at row 3: #S   SS# → column 2 is empty, no A. So no apple.\n\nIf moving DOWN to (5,2): row 5, column 2 is empty. No apple.\n\nIf moving LEFT (which is invalid due to collision), but even if it wasn't, (4,1) is S, so no apple.\n\nSo neither UP nor DOWN immediately leads to an apple. But we need to avoid collision and choose a direction that allows the snake to move towards apples without hitting itself or walls.\n\nLet's think about the snake's body positions. The snake is quite long, as row 6 is all S's (columns 1-6). Let's try to map the snake's body path to understand its current shape.\n\nLooking at row 6: #SSSSSS# → columns 1-6 are S. So positions (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nRow 5: #S    S# → (5,1), (5,6).\n\nRow 4: #SHSSSS# → (4,1), (4,2)=H, (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n\nRow 3: #S   SS# → (3,1), (3,5), (3,6).\n\nRow 2: #SS A  # → (2,1), (2,2), (2,4)=A.\n\nRow 1: #  AA  # → (1,2)=A, (1,3)=A.\n\nSo the snake's body is a complex shape. Let's see the direction the snake was moving. The current direction is LEFT. The head is at (4,2), moving left. The previous position (before the last move) would have been (4,3), because moving left from (4,3) would reach (4,2). Because when the snake moves, the head moves in the direction, and the body follows. So the body segments are the previous positions of the head.\n\nSo the body in (4,3) is the next segment after the head. Then (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3, maybe not). Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the snake's path.\n\nAlternatively, the snake's body is all the 'S's. So the head is H at (4,2), and the body is all S's. The snake's length is the number of S's plus 1 (the H). Let's count the S's:\n\nRow 1: 0 S (since row 1 has #  AA  # → S count 0)\nRow 2: #SS A  # → 2 S (columns 1,2)\nRow 3: #S   SS# → 3 S (columns 1,5,6)\nRow 4: #SHSSSS# → 5 S (columns 1,3,4,5,6) → H is at 2, so 1 (column 1) and 3-6 (columns 3-6) → 1+4=5?\nRow 5: #S    S# → 2 S (columns 1,6)\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# → 6 S (columns 1-6)\nTotal S's: 0 (row1) + 2 (row2) +3 (row3) +5 (row4) +2 (row5) +6 (row6) = 18 S's. So snake length is 19 (H + 18 S's). That's a long snake.\n\nThe snake's movement direction is LEFT. The next move can't be RIGHT. So options are UP, DOWN, LEFT. But moving LEFT leads to (4,1), which is S (body), collision. So LEFT is invalid. So possible directions are UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check the next positions for UP and DOWN.\n\nUP: (4,2) → (3,2). What's around (3,2)? The cell (3,2) is empty. The next move (epoch 45) would have the head at (3,2). The body would shift: the previous head position (4,2) becomes S, and the last body segment (probably the end of the tail) would be removed if no apple is eaten. But since there's no apple in (3,2), the snake's length remains the same (so the tail moves forward, i.e., the last S is removed).\n\nNow, after moving UP, what's the next possible direction? The new direction would be UP (if we choose UP now). Then, possible next directions would be LEFT or RIGHT (since you can't reverse UP to DOWN). But let's focus on the current move.\n\nIf we move DOWN: (4,2) → (5,2). (5,2) is empty. So that's safe. Then, the next direction could be DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (but can't reverse from DOWN to UP).\n\nNow, are there any apples that the snake can reach soon? The apples are at (1,2), (1,3), (2,4). Let's see the head's position. Current head is (4,2). To reach (1,2), the snake would need to move up three times (from row 4 to row 1). Let's see if that's possible.\n\nIf we move UP now (to (3,2)), then next possible directions (since direction is now UP) can be LEFT or RIGHT (can't go DOWN). Let's say after moving UP, the direction is UP, then next move could be UP again (if possible). Let's check (3,2) moving UP would go to (2,2). What's (2,2)? Row 2 is #SS A  # → column 2 is S. Oh! (2,2) is S (body). So if we move UP to (3,2), then the next move in direction UP would take us to (2,2), which is S. Collision. So moving UP now would lead to a possible collision in the next step if we continue UP.\n\nAlternatively, after moving UP to (3,2), the next direction could be LEFT or RIGHT. Let's check (3,2) moving LEFT (to (3,1)): (3,1) is S (row 3: #S   SS# → column 1 is S). So collision. Moving RIGHT from (3,2) would be (3,3). (3,3) is empty (row 3: #S   SS# → columns 3 is ' '). So that's safe.\n\nSo if we move UP now, next direction could be RIGHT. Then the head would be at (3,3), which is empty. Then perhaps move towards the apples in row 1, columns 2 and 3.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now: (4,2) → (5,2). Then, direction is DOWN. Next possible directions: DOWN (can't reverse to UP), LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check (5,2) moving DOWN to (6,2). Row 6 is #SSSSSS# → column 2 is S. So (6,2) is S → collision. So moving DOWN again would hit the body. So next direction after moving DOWN could be LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n(5,2) moving LEFT would be (5,1), which is S (row 5: #S    S# → column 1 is S). Collision. (5,2) moving RIGHT would be (5,3), which is empty (row 5: #S    S# → column 3 is ' '). So moving RIGHT from (5,2) would be safe.\n\nHmm. Both UP and DOWN options require turning RIGHT next. Let's see which path leads towards apples.\n\nThe apples are in row 1 (columns 2,3) and row 2 (column4). Let's see:\n\nIf we go UP to (3,2), then RIGHT to (3,3). Then, perhaps UP again towards row 2, column 3. Row 2 has (2,4) as an apple. Let's see (3,3) moving UP to (2,3). Row 2 is #SS A  # → column 3 is ' ' (since row 2 has columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'). So (2,3) is empty. Then, moving towards (2,4) (the apple there). That's possible.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (5,2), then RIGHT to (5,3). Then, perhaps UP towards row 4, 3, etc. But that might not be as close to the apples.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's current body is very long, so the available space might be limited. Let's check the empty cells. The empty cells (spaces) are:\n\nRow 1: columns 0 is '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#' → spaces at (1,1), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\nRow 2: columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#' → spaces at (2,3), (2,5), (2,6)\nRow 3: columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#' → spaces at (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\nRow 4: columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'H', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#' → only H is here, others S or #\nRow 5: columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: 'S', 7: '#' → spaces at (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\nRow 6: all S except walls.\n\nSo the empty spaces are in rows 1,2,3,5. The snake's head is in row 4. To reach the apples in row 1 and 2, moving up would be better.\n\nSo, if the snake moves UP now (to (3,2)), which is a safe move, then next steps can be towards the apples. Moving DOWN might take the snake into areas with less space (row 5,6) where the body is more dense.\n\nTherefore, the best direction to choose now is UP.\n\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#SS A  #\n#S   SS#\n#SHSSSS#\n#S    S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from the head's position (row 4, column 2) would take the head to (4, 1), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a collision, ending the game. Thus, LEFT is invalid.  \n- **UP**: Moving up from (4, 2) leads to (3, 2), which is an empty space (no walls or body). This is a safe move.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (4, 2) leads to (5, 2), which is also an empty space. This is safe but moves the snake away from the apples (located in rows 1 and 2).  \n\nTo reach the apples (at (1,2), (1,3), and (2,4)), moving UP brings the snake closer to the apples in the upper rows. Moving DOWN would take the snake toward row 5, which has fewer empty spaces and is farther from the apples. Thus, UP is the better choice.  \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  AA  # → So positions (1,2) and (1,3) are apples ('A')\nRow 2: #S  A  # → (2,1) is 'S' (body), (2,4) is 'A'\nRow 3: #SH  SS# → (3,1) is 'S', (3,2) is 'H' (head), (3,5) and (3,6) are 'S'\nRow 4: #SSSSSS# → (4,1) to (4,6) are all 'S'\nRow 5: #S    S# → (5,1) is 'S', (5,6) is 'S'\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# → (6,1) to (6,6) are 'S'\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake is moving up. Let's confirm the head's position. The head 'H' is at (3,2) (row 3, column 2, assuming rows are 0-7 and columns 0-7). \n\nNow, when the snake moves, the direction can't be reversed. Since current direction is UP, the snake can't go DOWN next. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. (Because reversing from UP is DOWN, which is not allowed.)\n\nLet's think about where the head will move if we choose each possible direction.\n\nFirst, current direction is UP. Let's see the next position for each possible direction:\n\n1. If direction is UP (same as current), the head moves up to row 2, column 2 (since row 3's head is at (3,2), moving up would be row 3-1=2, column 2). Let's check that cell. Row 2, column 2 is (row 2, column 2) → in row 2, the string is \"#S  A  #\", so columns are 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (2,2) is empty (a space). So moving up would take the head to (2,2), which is safe (not a wall, not a body part).\n\n2. If direction is LEFT, the head would move to (3,1) (since column 2-1=1). Let's check (3,1). Row 3 is \"#SH  SS#\", so column 1 is 'S' (body part). So moving left would cause the head to collide with the snake's own body. That's a game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n3. If direction is RIGHT, the head moves to (3,3) (column 2+1=3). Let's check row 3, column 3. The row is \"#SH  SS#\", columns are 0:'#',1:'S',2:'H',3:' ',4:' ',5:'S',6:'S',7:'#'. So (3,3) is a space. Safe.\n\n4. Direction DOWN is reversed, so not allowed. So possible directions are UP, RIGHT.\n\nNow, check if any of these directions lead to eating an apple. Let's see where the apples are. From the board:\n\nApples are at (1,2), (1,3), (2,4). Let's list their positions:\n\nRow 1 (second row) has 'AA' at columns 2 and 3 → (1,2), (1,3).\n\nRow 2 has 'A' at column 4 → (2,4).\n\nSo, the head is at (3,2). Let's check the next positions:\n\n- UP: (2,2) → is there an apple there? (2,2) is a space (from row 2: \"#S  A  #\"), so no.\n\n- RIGHT: (3,3) → (3,3) is a space, no apple.\n\nSo neither direction would eat an apple immediately. But we need to avoid collision.\n\nNow, check the snake's body. The snake's body is made of 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 2: (2,1)\n\nRow 3: (3,1), (3,5), (3,6)\n\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,6)\n\nRow 6: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSo, if moving UP to (2,2), that's a safe spot (no 'S' or '#'). Moving RIGHT to (3,3) is also a safe spot (no 'S' or '#').\n\nNow, we need to think about the future moves. The snake's body will follow. Let's consider the current snake's path. Since the current direction is UP, and the head is at (3,2), the body is behind. Let's think about the snake's structure. The snake is quite long, given the number of 'S's. The head is at (3,2). The next part of the body is probably (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), etc. Because in row 3, (3,1) is 'S', and row 4 has a line of 'S's from (4,1) to (4,6). So the snake's body is extending down from (3,1) into row 4, then across row 4, then up into row 5, 6. \n\nIf we choose UP, the head moves to (2,2). The next move (epoch 46) would have the snake's body follow. The tail (the last 'S') would move, but since the snake didn't eat an apple, the length remains the same, so the tail moves forward. But in any case, we need to make sure that the next move doesn't lead to a collision.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT, the head moves to (3,3). Let's check if that's a safe position. (3,3) is a space, so no collision. Then, in the next move, the direction could be adjusted, but since we need to choose the next direction now, perhaps we need to avoid positions that are surrounded by body.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if there are any apples in the possible paths. The apples are at (1,2), (1,3), (2,4). The head is at (3,2). Moving up towards (2,2) is getting closer to (1,2) and (1,3) apples. For example, if we go UP, then next possible directions could be UP again (to (1,2)), which is an apple. Let's check (1,2) → yes, that's an apple. So if the next move after UP is UP again, the head would move to (1,2), which is an apple. That would be good.\n\nLet's verify that. Current head (3,2). If we move UP (direction UP), head goes to (2,2). Then, next direction (if we choose UP again) would take the head to (1,2), which is an 'A' (apple). So that's a good path. So moving UP now allows the snake to reach an apple in the next step.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT now (head to (3,3)), then the next possible directions could be UP, RIGHT, or LEFT (since current direction would be RIGHT, so can't go LEFT). Wait, no: the direction after moving RIGHT would be RIGHT, so the next move's allowed directions would be RIGHT, UP, DOWN (since you can't reverse direction, so from RIGHT, can't go LEFT). But (3,3) moving RIGHT would be (3,4), which is a space (row 3, column 4 is ' '). Then, (3,4) moving UP would be (2,4), which is an apple (since row 2, column 4 is 'A'). That's another apple. So that's also a possible path.\n\nBut let's check the current positions again. Let's make sure that moving UP is safe. (2,2) is a space, no body, no wall. So that's safe. Moving RIGHT to (3,3) is also safe. So both directions are possible. But which is better?\n\nAlternatively, let's check if moving UP would cause any immediate problem. The head moves to (2,2). The body segments would shift. The previous head (3,2) becomes 'S', and the tail (the last 'S') would be removed (since no apple was eaten). Let's see where the tail is. The snake's body is in row 6: (6,1) to (6,6), row 5: (5,1) and (5,6), row 4: (4,1)-(4,6), row 3: (3,1), (3,5), (3,6), row 2: (2,1). So the tail is probably at the end of the longest part. Since the snake is long, the tail is likely in row 6, column 6 (since row 6 has all 'S's from column 1-6). So when the snake moves, the tail (6,6) would be removed, and the new head is (2,2). So the new body would have (3,2) as 'S', and the rest shift.\n\nIn any case, both directions are safe. But perhaps moving UP is better because it's moving towards the apples in row 1. Let's confirm the positions again. The apple at (1,2) is in row 1, column 2. If the head is at (2,2), moving UP again would reach (1,2) which is an apple. That would be a good move. So the plan would be to go UP now, then UP again to eat the apple. \n\nAlternatively, if we go RIGHT now, the head is at (3,3). Then, moving UP would take it to (2,3), which is a space (row 2, column 3 is ' '), then next move UP to (1,3), which is an apple (row 1, column 3 is 'A'). That's also a path to an apple. So both directions can lead to apples. \n\nBut the question is which direction is possible. The current direction is UP, so the allowed directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. LEFT is invalid (collision), so only UP and RIGHT are options. Between them, both are safe. So which one to choose? Maybe either is acceptable, but perhaps the best choice is to move towards the closest apple. The apples at (1,2) and (1,3) are in row 1, which is two steps up from the current head (3,2). So moving UP now would get us closer. \n\nSo I think the best direction is UP.\n\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#S  A  #\n#SH  SS#\n#SSSSSS#\n#S    S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (3, 2) (row 3, column 2).\n- **Current Direction**: UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is reversed and invalid).\n- **Collisions to Avoid**: Walls (boundaries) and self (body 'S').\n- **Apples**: Located at (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 4).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (3, 1). This cell contains 'S' (snake body), causing a self-collision. **Invalid**.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving right takes the head to (3, 3). This cell is empty (safe). No apple here, but this direction avoids collision.\n3. **UP**: Moving up takes the head to (2, 2). This cell is empty (safe). No apple here, but this direction moves the head closer to apples in row 1 (e.g., (1, 2) and (1, 3)).\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nMoving UP is preferable because it positions the snake to reach apples in row 1 in subsequent moves. For example, after moving UP to (2, 2), the next UP move would reach (1, 2), which is an apple. This path avoids collisions and aligns with growing the snake.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' as walls. Let's list out each row to get a clear picture:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  AA  # (so positions (1,2), (1,3) are apples)\nRow 2: # H A  # (so (2,1) is the head 'H', (2,3) is an apple 'A')\nRow 3: #SS  SS# (so (3,1), (3,2) are 'S' (body), then space, then (3,5), (3,6) are 'S')\nRow 4: #SSSSSS# (so (4,1) to (4,6) are all 'S')\nRow 5: #S    S# (so (5,1) and (5,6) are 'S')\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# (so (6,1) to (6,6) are 'S')\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the epoch is 46, which is well before 100, so the game isn't ending yet. The snake's head is at (2,1) (row 2, column 1, assuming rows are 0-based from top). Since the current direction is UP, the snake is moving upward. Let's confirm the possible directions the snake can turn. The snake can't reverse direction, so from UP, it can't go DOWN. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP (since UP is current direction, continuing is allowed).\n\nFirst, let's check where the head is moving if it continues in the current direction (UP). The head is at (2,1). Moving UP would take it to (1,1) (since row 2 is current, moving up decreases the row by 1). Let's check what's at (1,1). Looking at row 1: \"#  AA  #\", so positions are (1,0) '#', (1,1) ' ', (1,2) 'A', (1,3) 'A', (1,4) ' ', (1,5) ' ', (1,6) ' ', (1,7) '#'. So (1,1) is a space. So if moving UP, the head goes to (1,1). Now, we need to check if that's a wall or a body part. The walls are the edges, so (1,1) is inside, not a wall. What about the body? The body is 'S's. Let's check if (1,1) is an 'S'. The body positions are in rows 3,4,5,6. So (1,1) is empty, so moving UP is possible. But is there an apple there? No, (1,1) is space. So the snake would move to (1,1), the tail would move (since the snake's length is... let's calculate. The snake's body is all the 'S's plus the 'H'. Let's count the 'S's and 'H'. \n\nRow 2 has H (1). Rows 3: 2 S's (positions 1,2) and 2 S's (5,6) → 4. Row 4: 6 S's. Row 5: 2 S's. Row 6: 6 S's. So total S's: 4+6+2+6=18, plus H=1. So current length is 19. When the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (last segment) will move forward, so the length remains the same. If it eats an apple, the length increases by 1 (tail doesn't move, so the snake grows).\n\nNow, let's consider possible directions. The snake can choose UP (current direction, allowed), LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse, not allowed). Let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. UP: Next head position (1,1). Check if that's safe. (1,1) is empty (not wall, not S). So safe. But no apple here. So snake moves, no growth.\n\n2. LEFT: Direction left. The head is at (2,1). Moving left would take it to (2,0). (2,0) is a wall ('#' in row 2, first character). So moving left would hit the wall, game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n3. RIGHT: Direction right. Head is at (2,1). Moving right would take it to (2,2). What's at (2,2)? Let's check row 2: \"# H A  #\". So positions (2,0) '#', (2,1) 'H', (2,2) ' ', (2,3) 'A', (2,4) ' ', (2,5) ' ', (2,6) ' ', (2,7) '#'. So (2,2) is a space. Is that a body part? The body S's are in rows 3-6. (2,2) is row 2, column 2. Let's check if (2,2) is S. Looking at the board, row 2 has H at (2,1), A at (2,3), others are spaces. So (2,2) is safe. So moving right is possible. The next head position is (2,2). No apple here, so snake moves, no growth.\n\n4. DOWN: Reverse direction of current (UP), so not allowed. So direction can't be DOWN.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let's confirm the head's position. The head is 'H' in row 2. Let's check row 2: \"# H A  #\". So row 2's characters are: index 0 is '#', index 1 is ' ', index 2 is 'H'? Wait, maybe I misread the row. Let's parse each row correctly. Let's index columns from 0 to 7.\n\nRow 0: ######## → columns 0-7: all '#'\nRow 1: #  AA  # → columns 0='#', 1=' ', 2=' ', 3='A', 4='A', 5=' ', 6=' ', 7='#'\nRow 2: # H A  # → columns 0='#', 1=' ', 2='H', 3=' ', 4='A', 5=' ', 6=' ', 7='#' → Oh! Oh right, maybe I messed up the positions here. Let's correct that. Let's split each row into characters.\n\nRow 2: \"# H A  #\" → Let's split into individual characters. The string is \"# H A  #\". Let's count the positions (columns 0-7):\n\nColumn 0: '#'\nColumn 1: ' ' (space)\nColumn 2: 'H' (head)\nColumn 3: ' ' (space)\nColumn 4: 'A' (apple)\nColumn 5: ' ' (space)\nColumn 6: ' ' (space)\nColumn 7: '#'\n\nAh, that's a crucial mistake earlier. So the head is at (row 2, column 2), not (row 2, column 1). That changes everything. Let's re-analyze the positions correctly.\n\nLet's re-express all rows with correct column indices (0-7):\n\nRow 0: [0]# [1]# [2]# [3]# [4]# [5]# [6]# [7]#\nRow 1: [0]# [1] [2] [3]A [4]A [5] [6] [7]#\nRow 2: [0]# [1] [2]H [3] [4]A [5] [6] [7]#\nRow 3: [0]# [1]S [2]S [3] [4] [5]S [6]S [7]#\nRow 4: [0]# [1]S [2]S [3]S [4]S [5]S [6]S [7]#\nRow 5: [0]# [1]S [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]S [7]#\nRow 6: [0]# [1]S [2]S [3]S [4]S [5]S [6]S [7]#\nRow 7: [0]# [1]# [2]# [3]# [4]# [5]# [6]# [7]#\n\nSo the head 'H' is at (row 2, column 2). Current direction is UP, so moving UP would take the head to (row 1, column 2). Let's check (row 1, column 2): row 1 is \"#  AA  #\", which is [0]# [1] [2] [3]A [4]A [5] [6] [7]#. So (1,2) is a space. Is that safe?\n\nNow, check the body positions (all 'S's):\n\nRow 3: columns 1,2 (S,S), columns 5,6 (S,S) → positions (3,1), (3,2), (3,5), (3,6)\nRow 4: columns 1-6 (all S) → (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\nRow 5: columns 1 and 6 (S) → (5,1), (5,6)\nRow 6: columns 1-6 (all S) → (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSo the body is in these positions. Now, when moving in direction UP, the new head position is (1,2). Let's check if (1,2) is a body part (S) or a wall. (1,2) is in row 1, column 2. The walls are in column 0 and 7 of each row, so (1,2) is inside. And (1,2) is a space, not an S. So moving UP is safe.\n\nWhat about other directions:\n\nCurrent direction is UP, so can't reverse to DOWN. Possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLEFT direction: moving left from (2,2) would take head to (2,1). (2,1) is a space (row 2, column 1 is ' '). Check if (2,1) is a body part. The body parts are in rows 3-6. (2,1) is row 2, column 1. Looking at the body positions, (3,1) is S (row 3, column 1), but (2,1) is row 2, column 1, which is a space. So (2,1) is safe. So moving LEFT is possible.\n\nRIGHT direction: moving right from (2,2) to (2,3). (2,3) is a space (row 2, column 3 is ' '). Check if (2,3) is a body part. The body parts are in rows 3-6, so (2,3) is safe. So moving RIGHT is possible.\n\nNow, check if any of these directions lead to apples. Let's see where the apples are. Apples are 'A's on the board. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: columns 3 and 4 → (1,3) and (1,4) are A.\nRow 2: column 4 → (2,4) is A.\n\nSo current apples are at (1,3), (1,4), (2,4).\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (1,2), then (1,2) is a space. No apple. So no growth.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT to (2,1), (2,1) is a space. No apple.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (2,3), (2,3) is a space. No apple.\n\nWhat if the snake moves in a direction that will reach an apple in the next step? Let's think about future steps, but since we can only choose the next direction, let's see.\n\nThe current head is at (2,2). Let's check possible next moves and their outcomes:\n\nOption 1: UP → new head (1,2). The next position. Is there an apple adjacent to (1,2) in the direction of movement? The next move after that would depend on the direction. But maybe we need to avoid the body. Let's check the body positions again. The snake's body is in a complex shape. Let's see the snake's path. Since the snake is made of S's, the body is connected. Let's try to trace the body to find the tail and the direction the body is moving.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check for possible collisions in the next move.\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (1,2). Let's check if (1,2) is a body part. The body parts are in rows 3-6, so (1,2) is safe. So that's okay.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT to (2,1). (2,1) is a space, no collision. Safe.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (2,3). (2,3) is a space, no collision. Safe.\n\nNow, which direction is better? The goal is to eat apples. Let's see where the apples are. The apples are at (1,3), (1,4), (2,4). Let's see the distance from the head (2,2) to these apples.\n\nApple at (2,4): column 4, row 2. So from (2,2) to (2,4) is two steps to the right (RIGHT, then RIGHT again). So if the snake turns RIGHT now, next head is (2,3), then next move RIGHT would reach (2,4) (the apple). That would be good.\n\nApple at (1,3): row 1, column 3. So from (2,2) moving UP to (1,2), then RIGHT to (1,3) (which is an apple). So if the snake moves UP first, then RIGHT, it can reach that apple.\n\nApple at (1,4): row 1, column 4. So from (2,2) moving UP to (1,2), then RIGHT twice (to (1,3), (1,4)) to reach that apple.\n\nSo perhaps moving RIGHT now would allow the snake to reach (2,4) in the next step (if it continues RIGHT). Let's check:\n\nCurrent head (2,2). If direction is RIGHT, next head (2,3). Then, if the next direction is RIGHT again (since current direction would be RIGHT, can't reverse), the head would move to (2,4), which is an apple. Eating that apple would increase the score and the snake would grow. That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP now: head (1,2). Then, if direction is RIGHT, next head (1,3), which is an apple. That's even better. Because (1,3) is an apple, so moving UP then RIGHT would get an apple in the next step.\n\nLet's verify:\n\nCurrent direction is UP. If we choose UP as the next direction, the head moves to (1,2). Then, the next possible directions would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't go DOWN). If in the next step, the direction is RIGHT, then the head would move from (1,2) to (1,3), which is an apple. So that's a possible path.\n\nBut the question is, what direction should we choose now (epoch 46) to maximize the chance of eating apples. Let's check the current possible moves again.\n\nIf we choose UP now:\n\nNew head position: (1,2). Check if that's safe. Yes, (1,2) is empty. Then, the next move could be RIGHT to (1,3) (apple). That's a good path.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT now:\n\nNew head (2,3). Then next move RIGHT to (2,4) (apple). Also good.\n\nIf we choose LEFT now:\n\nNew head (2,1). Then where? (2,1) is a space. The next moves would have to be LEFT (but (2,0) is a wall), UP, or RIGHT. If LEFT is chosen, (2,0) is wall → death. So moving LEFT now might not be the best option.\n\nSo between UP and RIGHT. Let's check if moving UP now would lead to a collision in the next steps. The snake's body is in row 3,4,5,6. Let's see the area around (1,2). The body is not in row 1, so (1,2) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (2,3) is also safe.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any possible collisions in the current move.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's body's position. Let's think about the snake's movement. Since the snake is moving, the body follows. The head moves, and each body segment follows the previous one. So, the current body positions are the path the head has taken. Let's try to find the tail. The tail is the last segment of the body. Let's look for the S that is not followed by another S in the direction of movement. Since the current direction is UP, the head is moving up. The body segments would follow the head's path.\n\nBut perhaps it's complicated. Let's instead focus on the current possible moves and which direction leads to an apple in the next step.\n\nIf we move UP now, the next head is (1,2). Then, if we turn RIGHT, the next head is (1,3) (apple). That's one step away from an apple.\n\nIf we move RIGHT now, next head (2,3). Then, next move RIGHT to (2,4) (apple). Also one step away.\n\nWhich of these paths is possible without collision?\n\nLet's check (1,3) (apple) when moving UP then RIGHT. (1,3) is in row 1, column 3. The body is not there, so that's safe.\n\n(2,4) (apple) is in row 2, column 4. The body is not there, so that's safe.\n\nSo both directions (UP and RIGHT) can lead to eating an apple in the next step. But which is better?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more immediate apple. Let's check the head's current position (2,2). Is there an apple adjacent in any direction except the current direction's reverse?\n\nThe head is at (2,2). Adjacent positions:\n\nUP: (1,2) → space\nDOWN: (3,2) → S (body, since row 3, column 2 is S). So moving DOWN would hit the body. But DOWN is reverse direction of UP, which is already invalid.\nLEFT: (2,1) → space\nRIGHT: (2,3) → space\nSo the adjacent positions are safe except DOWN (which is invalid). So the snake can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nNow, the apples are at (1,3), (1,4), (2,4). So the closest apples are (2,4) (distance 2 to the right) and (1,3) (distance 1 up and 1 right).\n\nIf we choose UP now, then the next position is (1,2). Then, moving RIGHT would reach (1,3) (apple) in the next step. So that's two moves (current epoch 46: move UP, epoch 47: move RIGHT to get apple).\n\nIf we choose RIGHT now, then next position (2,3). Then, moving RIGHT again (epoch 47 direction RIGHT) would reach (2,4) (apple) in epoch 47. So that's one move to reach the apple.\n\nSo choosing RIGHT now allows the snake to reach an apple in the next step (epoch 47), which is better.\n\nWait, because in epoch 46, the direction we choose is for the current move. Let's clarify:\n\nCurrent epoch is 46. The snake is moving in direction UP. The player provides a direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but DOWN is invalid). The snake moves in the provided direction (if allowed) in epoch 46. So after the move, the epoch becomes 47.\n\nSo if we choose RIGHT as the direction for epoch 46, the snake moves RIGHT from (2,2) to (2,3) (epoch 46 move). Then, in epoch 47, the current direction is RIGHT. Then, the player can choose to move RIGHT again (since current direction is RIGHT, can't reverse to LEFT), so the snake moves RIGHT to (2,4) (which is an apple). So in epoch 47, the snake would eat the apple.\n\nThat's a good plan. So choosing RIGHT now (epoch 46) allows the snake to reach (2,3), then in epoch 47, move RIGHT again to (2,4) (apple). So that's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose UP now (epoch 46), the snake moves to (1,2). Then, in epoch 47, the current direction is UP, so possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. If we choose RIGHT, the snake moves to (1,3) (apple). That's also good.\n\nBut which of these directions (UP or RIGHT) is possible without collision in their next steps.\n\nBut let's check if moving RIGHT now (epoch 46) to (2,3) is safe. (2,3) is a space, not a body part. The body parts are in rows 3-6. So (2,3) is safe. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving UP to (1,2) is safe.\n\nSo which direction is better? Let's see if there's any other factors, like possible collisions with the body in the near future.\n\nLooking at the body in row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,5), (3,6). Row 4: (4,1-6). Row 5: (5,1), (5,6). Row 6: (6,1-6).\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (2,3), then in the next step (epoch 47) moving RIGHT to (2,4) (apple). After eating the apple, the snake's length increases. The new head is (2,4), and the body would extend. That's safe.\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (1,2), then in epoch 47 moving RIGHT to (1,3) (apple), which is also safe.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better option. Let's check if there's any apple in the current direction (UP). The current direction is UP. The next position is (1,2). There's no apple there, but moving UP again would take the snake to (0,2), which is a wall (row 0 is all #). So moving UP twice would hit the wall. So after moving UP once (epoch 46), the next direction can't be UP again (since (0,2) is a wall), so the snake would have to turn LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nBut moving RIGHT in epoch 46 allows the snake to move towards (2,4) apple, which is in the same row. That's a better path.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's current body is very long and occupies most of the lower part of the board (rows 3-6). The upper part (rows 1-2) is mostly empty, so moving up gives more space. But the apples are in the upper part, so that's good.\n\nBut the best immediate move is to head towards the nearest apple. The apple at (2,4) is in the same row as the head (row 2), two columns to the right. So moving RIGHT now gets the snake closer to that apple.\n\nSo the best direction to choose now is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is as follows:\n########\n#  AA  #\n# H A  #\n#SS  SS#\n#SSSSSS#\n#S    S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at (row 2, column 2), and the current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (2,2) would take the head to (2,1). This position is a space (not a wall or body part), so it is safe. However, there is no apple here, and further left movement would quickly approach the wall (column 0), limiting future options.  \n- **UP**: Moving up from (2,2) would take the head to (1,2). This position is a space (safe), but no apple is present here. Continuing up would lead to the top wall (row 0) in the next move, requiring a turn.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (2,2) would take the head to (2,3). This position is a space (safe), and it brings the snake closer to the apple at (2,4) (in the same row, one column to the right). If the snake continues moving RIGHT in the next epoch, it will reach (2,4) and eat the apple, increasing the score.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is optimal as it positions the snake to reach an apple in the next move, maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8 with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  AA  # → positions (1,2) and (1,3) are apples ('A')\nRow 2: # SHA  # → Let's check the positions. The row is 8 characters including the #s. So positions (2,1) is ' ', (2,2) is 'S', (2,3) is 'H' (head), (2,4) is 'A', (2,5) is ' ', (2,6) is ' ' (since the row ends with #). So head is at (2,3).\nRow 3: # S  SS# → Let's parse: (3,1) ' ', (3,2) 'S', (3,3) ' ', (3,4) ' ', (3,5) 'S', (3,6) 'S'\nRow 4: #SSSSSS# → (4,1) 'S', (4,2) 'S', (4,3) 'S', (4,4) 'S', (4,5) 'S', (4,6) 'S'\nRow 5: #S    S# → (5,1) 'S', (5,2) ' ', (5,3) ' ', (5,4) ' ', (5,5) ' ', (5,6) 'S'\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# → (6,1) 'S', (6,2) 'S', (6,3) 'S', (6,4) 'S', (6,5) 'S', (6,6) 'S'\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake's head is at (2,3). Since the direction is RIGHT, the next move would be to (2,4) if we keep moving RIGHT. Let's check what's at (2,4). Looking at row 2: # SHA  # → (2,4) is 'A' (since row 2's characters are: index 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is 'S', 3 is 'H', 4 is 'A', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'). So (2,4) is an apple. If we move RIGHT, the head moves to (2,4), eats the apple, grows, and the score increases. That's good. But we need to check if that's safe.\n\nBut wait, we also need to make sure that the new head position isn't a wall or part of the snake's body. Let's confirm: (2,4) is within the board (since rows 0-7, columns 0-7, (2,4) is row 2, column 4. Columns 0 and 7 are walls, so column 4 is okay. The cell (2,4) is 'A', so not a wall or body. So moving RIGHT would be safe here. \n\nNow, what are the other possible directions? The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake can't reverse direction (so can't go LEFT). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse). Let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. UP: The head is at (2,3). Moving UP would take it to (1,3). Let's check (1,3). Row 1 is #  AA  #. Columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (1,3) is 'A'. That's an apple. But is (1,3) a valid position? The walls are at row 0 and 7, column 0 and 7. (1,3) is row 1, column 3: row 1 is between 0 and 7, column 3 is between 0 and 7, so not a wall. What about the snake's body? The snake's body is 'S's. Let's check if (1,3) is part of the body. Looking at other rows: row 2 has 'S' at (2,2). Row 3 has 'S' at (3,2), (3,5), (3,6). Row 4 has all S's. Row 5 has S at (5,1) and (5,6). Row 6 has all S's. So (1,3) is 'A' and not part of the body. So moving UP would also be possible, but let's check if that's safe.\n\n2. DOWN: Head is at (2,3). Moving DOWN would take it to (3,3). Let's check (3,3). Row 3 is # S  SS#. So positions (3,0) is '#', (3,1) ' ', (3,2) 'S', (3,3) ' ', (3,4) ' ', (3,5) 'S', (3,6) 'S', (3,7) '#'. So (3,3) is ' ' (empty). Is that part of the snake's body? The snake's body is 'S's. The current body is at (2,2) (from row 2: # SHA  # → (2,2) is 'S'), (3,2), (3,5), (3,6), row 4 (all S's), row 5 (S at 1 and 6), row 6 (all S's). So (3,3) is empty. So moving DOWN would take the head to (3,3), which is safe, but no apple there.\n\n3. RIGHT: As discussed, (2,4) is 'A', so eating that apple. Safe.\n\nNow, which direction is best? The snake's goal is to eat as many apples as possible. So moving towards apples is better. Let's see where the apples are. The current apples are in row 1, columns 2 and 3 (positions (1,2) and (1,3)), and row 2, column 4 (position (2,4)). So three apples. \n\nIf we move RIGHT: head goes to (2,4), which is an apple. So that's good. The snake grows. The next position would be (2,4), which is safe. \n\nIf we move UP: head goes to (1,3), which is an apple. Also good. Let's check if moving UP is possible. The current direction is RIGHT. Can the snake turn UP? Yes, because UP is not the reverse of RIGHT. The reverse of RIGHT is LEFT. So changing direction to UP is allowed.\n\nBut we need to check if after moving UP, the next position is safe. Let's confirm (1,3). The cell (1,3) is 'A' (so not body, not wall). So moving UP would eat an apple.\n\nBut which direction is better? Let's think about the snake's body. The snake's body is in a complex arrangement. Let's try to track the snake's body segments. The head is at (2,3). The body is 'S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 2: (2,2) → S (this is adjacent to head, so probably the next body segment)\nRow 3: (3,2), (3,5), (3,6)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,6)\nRow 6: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSo the snake's body is quite long. The head is at (2,3), next to (2,2) (S), which is part of the body. So the body is connected. Let's imagine the snake's movement. Since direction is RIGHT, the next move if direction is RIGHT would be (2,4). Then, the body would follow. The previous head position (2,3) becomes S, and the new head is (2,4).\n\nIf direction is UP, moving to (1,3). Then the previous head (2,3) becomes S, and new head is (1,3). That's also possible.\n\nBut let's check possible collisions. For example, if moving UP to (1,3), then next move. But since the epoch is 47 (out of 100), we need to make sure that the move doesn't lead to a collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (2,4) (apple) is safe. Let's confirm (2,4) is not a wall (row 2, column 4: columns 0 and 7 are walls, so column 4 is safe). And (2,4) is 'A', not body. So moving RIGHT is safe and gets an apple. That's a good move.\n\nSo the best direction here is RIGHT, as it leads to eating an apple immediately.\n\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n# SHA  #\n# S  SS#\n#SSSSSS#\n#S    S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 2, column 3). The current direction is RIGHT.\n2. **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (row 1, column 2), (row 1, column 3), and (row 2, column 4).\n3. **Movement Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., RIGHT → LEFT is invalid). Valid directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 2, column 4), which contains an apple ('A'). This position is within the board (not a wall) and not occupied by the snake's body ('S'). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake safely.\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 1, column 3), which also contains an apple. This position is valid (not a wall or body), but it is less critical than RIGHT since the snake can safely prioritize the closer apple.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 3, column 3), an empty space (' '). This avoids collision but does not eat an apple, making it less optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT directly leads to eating an apple, which maximizes the score. It is safe and aligns with the snake's goal of consuming apples.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided. \n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' walls. Let's list out each row to visualize the snake's position and the apples.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  AA  # → positions (1,2) and (1,3) are apples (A)\nRow 2: # SSH  # → Let's check the characters here. Columns 1 is '#', then (2,1) is ' ', (2,2) 'S', (2,3) 'S', (2,4) 'H', (2,5) ' ', (2,6) ' ', (2,7) '#'\nWait, no. Let's index rows from 0 to 7 and columns from 0 to 7 (since it's 8x8). So each row is 8 characters. Let's parse each row properly:\n\nRow 0: index 0: [0,0] = '#', [0,1]='#', ..., [0,7]='#'\nRow 1: [1,0]='#', [1,1]=' ', [1,2]=' ', [1,3]='A', [1,4]='A', [1,5]=' ', [1,6]=' ', [1,7]='#'\nRow 2: [2,0]='#', [2,1]=' ', [2,2]='S', [2,3]='S', [2,4]='H', [2,5]=' ', [2,6]=' ', [2,7]='#'\nRow 3: [3,0]='#', [3,1]='A', [3,2]='S', [3,3]=' ', [3,4]=' ', [3,5]='S', [3,6]='S', [3,7]='#'\nRow 4: [4,0]='#', [4,1]='S', [4,2]='S', [4,3]='S', [4,4]='S', [4,5]='S', [4,6]='S', [4,7]='#'\nRow 5: [5,0]='#', [5,1]='S', [5,2]=' ', [5,3]=' ', [5,4]=' ', [5,5]=' ', [5,6]='S', [5,7]='#'\nRow 6: [6,0]='#', [6,1]='S', [6,2]='S', [6,3]='S', [6,4]='S', [6,5]='S', [6,6]='S', [6,7]='#'\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,4) (row 2, column 4) because that's where 'H' is. The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake is moving to the right. The next position the head would move to if the direction remains RIGHT is (2,5). Let's check that cell. (2,5) is a ' ' (empty), so that's safe. But we need to check possible directions the snake can turn. The snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is RIGHT, the opposite direction is LEFT. So the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT is reversing and not allowed).\n\nWait, the problem states: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, wait, example: if current direction is UP, the snake can't turn to DOWN (reverse). If current direction is LEFT, can't turn to RIGHT. So current direction is RIGHT, so reverse is LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's check the next positions for each possible direction.\n\nCurrent head position: (2,4). Let's get coordinates right. Let's assume rows are 0 (top) to 7 (bottom), columns 0 (left) to 7 (right). So moving UP would decrease the row by 1, DOWN increases row by 1, LEFT decreases column by 1, RIGHT increases column by 1.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT, so the head is moving towards (2,5) if direction is RIGHT. Let's check the possible directions:\n\n1. RIGHT (current direction): Next head position is (2,5). What's in (2,5)? Looking at row 2: \"# SSH  #\", which is [2,0]='#', [2,1]=' ', [2,2]='S', [2,3]='S', [2,4]='H', [2,5]=' ', [2,6]=' ', [2,7]='#'. So (2,5) is ' ', empty. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,5). Then, since the snake moves, the body segments follow. The current body is the 'S's. The snake's length is the number of 'S's plus 1 (the head). Let's count the 'S's:\n\nRow 2: 'S', 'S' → (2,2), (2,3)\nRow 3: 'S', 'S', 'S' → (3,2), (3,5), (3,6)\nRow 4: all 'S's → (4,1) to (4,6) → 6 S's\nRow 5: 'S', 'S' → (5,1), (5,6)\nRow 6: all 'S's → (6,1) to (6,6) → 6 S's\nTotal S's: 2 (row2) + 3 (row3) +6 (row4) +2 (row5) +6 (row6) = 19 S's. So snake length is 20 (19 S + 1 H). When the snake moves, the tail (the last S) would move only if it doesn't eat an apple. But in this case, if moving to (2,5) which is empty, the tail would move. So the new head is (2,5), and the body shifts. But collision is only if the head hits a wall or S. (2,5) is empty, so safe.\n\n2. UP: Next head position would be (1,4). Because moving UP from (2,4) → row 1, column 4. Let's check (1,4). Row 1 is \"#  AA  #\", which is [1,0]='#', [1,1]=' ', [1,2]=' ', [1,3]='A', [1,4]='A', [1,5]=' ', [1,6]=' ', [1,7]='#'. So (1,4) is 'A' (apple). If the snake moves UP, the head goes to (1,4), eats the apple. Then the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move (since eating an apple adds a segment). So that's good. The score increases by 1, and the apple at (1,4) is removed, and a new apple would be placed (but the example shows that when you eat an apple, the apple is replaced in the next state. But the problem statement says the game starts with 3 apples. Let's check current apples. Current board has 'A's at (1,3), (1,4), (3,1). So 3 apples. So if the snake eats (1,4), then the next state would have 2 apples, but the problem says \"each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one\" and \"the game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board\". So the apple is consumed, and perhaps a new one is generated, but that's not part of the current decision.\n\nSo moving UP: head to (1,4) (apple). Safe, since (1,4) is not a wall or S. So this is a valid move.\n\n3. DOWN: Next head position is (3,4). Let's check (3,4). Row 3 is \"#AS  SS#\", which is [3,0]='#', [3,1]='A', [3,2]='S', [3,3]=' ', [3,4]=' ', [3,5]='S', [3,6]='S', [3,7]='#'. So (3,4) is ' ', empty. So moving DOWN would take the head to (3,4), which is safe.\n\n4. LEFT: Reverse direction. Current direction is RIGHT, so LEFT is reverse. Not allowed. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's see the positions of apples. Current apples are at (1,3), (1,4), (3,1). So (1,3) and (1,4) are in row 1, columns 3 and 4. (3,1) is row 3, column 1.\n\nIf we move UP, we reach (1,4), which is an apple. That's good. So that's a possible move. Let's check if moving UP is possible (no collision). The head's next position is (1,4). Is that a wall? No, row 1 is within 0-7 (rows 0 is top, 7 is bottom). Column 4 is 0-7. So (1,4) is inside the board. And (1,4) is 'A', not 'S' or '#', so no collision. So moving UP is safe and will eat an apple.\n\nIf we move RIGHT, next position (2,5) is empty, no apple. So no score gain.\n\nIf we move DOWN, next position (3,4) is empty, no apple. So no score gain.\n\nSo the best move is UP, as it allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score. Are there any other considerations? Let's check if moving UP could lead to a collision in the next steps, but since the current epoch is 48 (out of 100), we just need to make sure the next move is safe. Since (1,4) is an apple, moving there is safe and beneficial.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  AA  #\n# SSH  #\n#AS  SS#\n#SSSSSS#\n#S    S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (2, 4) (row 2, column 4).\n- The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT.\n- Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **RIGHT**: The next head position would be (2, 5). This cell is empty (' '), so it is safe but does not contain an apple. No score gain.\n2. **DOWN**: The next head position would be (3, 4). This cell is empty (' '), so it is safe but does not contain an apple. No score gain.\n3. **UP**: The next head position would be (1, 4). This cell contains an apple ('A'), so moving here would allow the snake to eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length. The cell (1, 4) is within the board (not a wall) and not occupied by the snake's body ('S'), so it is safe.\n\nMoving UP is the optimal choice as it allows the snake to eat an apple and gain a score, while the other directions do not provide immediate apple consumption.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). Let's list out each row to visualize the positions:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  AH  # (so positions (1,2) is ' ', (1,3) is 'A', (1,4) is 'H', (1,5) is ' ')\nRow 2: # SSS  # (positions (2,1) ' ', (2,2) 'S', (2,3) 'S', (2,4) 'S', (2,5) ' ', (2,6) ' ')\nRow 3: #AS  SS# (positions (3,1) 'A', (3,2) 'S', (3,3) ' ', (3,4) ' ', (3,5) 'S', (3,6) 'S')\nRow 4: #SSSSSS# (positions (4,1) 'S', (4,2) 'S', (4,3) 'S', (4,4) 'S', (4,5) 'S', (4,6) 'S')\nRow 5: #S  A S# (positions (5,1) 'S', (5,2) ' ', (5,3) ' ', (5,4) 'A', (5,5) ' ', (5,6) 'S')\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# (positions (6,1) 'S', (6,2) 'S', (6,3) 'S', (6,4) 'S', (6,5) 'S', (6,6) 'S')\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe snake's head is 'H' at position (1,4). The current direction is UP. The snake is moving up, which in grid terms would mean decreasing the row index. Let's confirm the movement direction: UP would mean from row 1 to row 0. But row 0 is a wall (all '#'), so if the snake continues moving UP, the head would go to (0,4), which is a wall. That's a collision, so the game would end. So moving UP is definitely a bad idea.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is UP, the reverse would be DOWN. So the snake can't choose DOWN as the next direction? Wait, no. The rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So if current direction is UP, the snake can't immediately turn to DOWN. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP. But moving UP leads to a wall, so that's a collision. So the possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check where the head is: (1,4). Let's find the current direction and possible next positions.\n\nCurrent direction is UP. So the next position if moving UP would be (0,4) which is a wall. So that's a loss. So we can't choose UP.\n\nPossible directions to turn: LEFT or RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse and not allowed). Let's check each.\n\nFirst, direction LEFT: moving left from (1,4) would take the head to (1,3). Let's check what's at (1,3). Looking at row 1: \"#  AH  #\", so (1,3) is 'A' (apple). So if the snake moves LEFT, the head goes to (1,3), which is an apple. Eating the apple would make the snake grow. The new head is at (1,3), and the body would extend. But we need to check if moving LEFT would cause a collision with the body.\n\nWait, the current snake's body is made of 'S's. Let's track the snake's body. The head is at (1,4). The body parts are the 'S's connected to it. Let's see:\n\nLooking at row 2: \"# SSS  #\", so (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) are 'S's. The head is at (1,4). So (2,4) is 'S' (row 2, column 4), which is directly below the head (since row 1 is above row 2). So the snake's body is moving down from the head. Because the current direction is UP, but the previous movement must have been such that the body follows. Wait, the snake's movement is such that each part follows the one in front. So if the head was moving UP, then the previous position of the head was (2,4), and then it moved up to (1,4). So the body now includes (2,4), (3,4), etc. Let's reconstruct the snake's body path.\n\nLet's list all 'S' positions and the head. The head is at (1,4). The 'S's are:\n\nRow 2: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,5), (3,6)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,6)\nRow 6: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nHmm, this might be a bit complex, but perhaps the key is to check if the next position (when moving LEFT or RIGHT) is a body part (S) or a wall.\n\nIf the direction is LEFT: next head position is (1,3). What's (1,3)? It's 'A' (apple). So no collision with the body here. Because (1,3) is an apple. So moving LEFT would eat the apple, increase the score, and the snake grows. Then, the new head is at (1,3), and the body would follow. Since the snake was moving UP, but now turns LEFT, the next movement would have the body parts shift.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: next head position is (1,5). Let's check (1,5) in row 1: \"#  AH  #\", so (1,5) is ' ' (empty). Now, we need to check if (1,5) is a body part. Are there any 'S's at (1,5)? Looking at all rows, (1,5) is ' ', so no. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (1,5), which is safe (no collision with body or wall). Then, the snake's length remains the same (since no apple eaten here).\n\nBut wait, the snake's current direction is UP. If we turn LEFT, that's allowed (since LEFT is not the reverse direction of UP). Reverse of UP is DOWN. So allowed directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. But UP leads to a wall, so only LEFT and RIGHT are possible.\n\nSo, moving LEFT: (1,3) is 'A' (apple). That's good, as it increases the score. Also, (1,3) is not a body part (since the body is in other positions). So that's safe.\n\nMoving RIGHT: (1,5) is empty, but that's safe. But no apple there, so no score gain.\n\nSo the best choice is to move LEFT, eat the apple, and grow. Because that's a safe move (no collision) and gives a point. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head is (1,4). Direction LEFT: new head (1,3). Check if (1,3) is a wall? No. Is (1,3) a body part (S)? No, it's an apple. So that's safe. So moving LEFT is the correct direction.\n\n\n########\n#  AH  #\n# SSS  #\n#AS  SS#\n#SSSSSS#\n#S  A S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (1,4) (row 1, column 4). The current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). \n\n- Moving UP would take the head to (0,4), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'), causing a collision. This is invalid.\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (1,3), which is an apple 'A'. This position is not a wall or part of the snake's body ('S'), so it is safe. Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake.\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (1,5), which is an empty space (' '). This position is safe but does not contain an apple.\n\nThe best move is to eat the apple by moving LEFT. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls (#######) around the edges. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #  HS  #\nRow 2: # SSS  #\nRow 3: #AS ASS#\nRow 4: #SSSSSS#\nRow 5: #S  A S#\nRow 6: #SSSSSS#\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. The current direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 50 (so 50 moves have been made, 50 left before the game ends at 100). \n\nFirst, I need to find the position of the head. Let's check row 1: \"#  HS  #\". So in row 1, columns 2 is a space, column 3 is 'H', column 4 is 'S', column 5 is space, column 6 is space. So the head (H) is at (row 1, column 3) [assuming rows and columns start at 0].\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. So normally, the snake is moving left, which would take it to (row 1, column 2) next. But we need to check if that's a valid move (not a wall or self-collision).\n\nLet's check the next position if moving LEFT: (1,2). The current cell (1,2) is a space (from row 1: \"#  HS  #\", so positions 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is space, 3 is H, 4 is S, 5 is space, 6 is space, 7 is #). So (1,2) is empty. But wait, the snake's body is made of S's. Let's check if (1,2) is part of the body. Looking at the current board, row 1 has \"  HS  \" so (1,2) is space. So moving left to (1,2) is possible. But maybe there's a better direction.\n\nBut the snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is LEFT, so the snake can't turn RIGHT (since LEFT and RIGHT are opposites). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT (since reversing is not allowed).\n\nWait, the problem states: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So if current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since moving in the same direction is allowed).\n\nNow, let's check possible moves:\n\nCurrent head position is (1,3). Let's note coordinates as (row, column). Rows go from 0 (top) to 7 (bottom). Columns 0 (left) to 7 (right).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So moving LEFT would take head to (1, 3-1) = (1,2).\n\nIf direction is UP: moving UP would take head to (1-1,3) = (0,3). But row 0 is the top wall (all #), so (0,3) is a wall. So moving UP would cause a collision with the wall. That's a game over. So UP is invalid.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: moving DOWN would take head to (1+1,3) = (2,3). Let's check row 2: \"# SSS  #\". So row 2, columns 1 is space, 2 is S, 3 is S, 4 is S, 5 is space, 6 is space. So (2,3) is 'S' (snake's body). So moving DOWN would cause a self-collision. That's game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: moving to (1,2). Let's check what's there. (1,2) is a space (from row 1: \"  HS  \"), so it's empty. So that's a valid move. No collision. So the snake would move left, head to (1,2), and the body would follow. Since there's no apple there, the snake's length remains the same. \n\nBut wait, are there any apples nearby that we can reach? Let's check the positions of apples (A) on the board. Let's look through each row:\n\nRow 1: no A.\nRow 2: no A.\nRow 3: \"#AS ASS#\" → columns 1: A, 2: S, 3: A, 4: space, 5: S, 6: S. So (3,1) and (3,3) are A.\nRow 4: \"#SSSSSS#\" → no A.\nRow 5: \"#S  A S#\" → columns 1: S, 2: space, 3: space, 4: A, 5: space, 6: S. So (5,4) is A.\nRow 6: \"#SSSSSS#\" → no A.\n\nSo apples are at (3,1), (3,3), (5,4).\n\nThe head is at (1,3). Let's see possible paths. Current direction is LEFT. If we move left, next head is (1,2). Then, what's the next possible moves? Let's think about the snake's body. The snake's body is S's. Let's track the body positions.\n\nCurrent snake body: Let's list all S and H positions. H is at (1,3). Then S's are:\n\nRow 1: (1,4) (since row 1 is \"#  HS  #\", so (1,4) is S).\n\nRow 2: \"# SSS  #\" → (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) are S.\n\nRow 3: \"#AS ASS#\" → (3,2) (S), (3,5) (S), (3,6) (S).\n\nRow 4: \"#SSSSSS#\" → (4,1) to (4,6) are S.\n\nRow 5: \"#S  A S#\" → (5,1), (5,6) are S.\n\nRow 6: \"#SSSSSS#\" → (6,1) to (6,6) are S.\n\nSo the snake is quite long, filling most of the lower rows. The head is at (1,3), with a body segment to the right (1,4), then row 2 has S's from (2,2) to (2,4), row 3 has S's at (3,2), (3,5), (3,6), row 4 is all S's from column 1-6, row 5 has S's at (5,1) and (5,6), row 6 all S's 1-6.\n\nSo the snake's body is in a complex shape, probably forming a loop or some structure. The head is in row 1, which is upper middle.\n\nThe possible moves are only LEFT (since UP and DOWN are invalid). Because moving UP leads to wall, moving DOWN leads to body, moving RIGHT is reverse direction (invalid). So the only possible direction is LEFT.\n\nSo the answer must be LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  HS  #\n# SSS  #\n#AS ASS#\n#SSSSSS#\n#S  A S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (1, 3) (row 1, column 3) with the current direction being LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so RIGHT is invalid. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0, 3), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'), causing a collision. This is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (2, 3), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S' in row 2), causing a self-collision. This is invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (1, 2), which is an empty space (no wall or body). This is a valid move.  \n\nSince UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are invalid, the only safe direction is LEFT.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls as '#'. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S', and apples are 'A'. The current direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 51, so we have 49 epochs left before the game ends. The snake can't reverse direction, so from LEFT, it can't go RIGHT. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT (but since the current direction is LEFT, maybe the player can choose to keep moving LEFT, but the question is about the direction input the player gives, which can be any of the four except reversing. Wait, the rules say: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So current direction is LEFT. So the next direction can't be RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. Because LEFT is the current direction, continuing LEFT is allowed.\n\nFirst, let's map the current positions. Let's index the rows from top to bottom as 0 to 7, and columns left to right as 0 to 7.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # HSS  # → columns 1 is 'H', 2 and 3 are 'S', rest (4,5,6) are spaces. So positions (1,1)=H, (1,2)=S, (1,3)=S.\nRow 2: # SSS  # → columns 1,2,3 are S. So (2,1)=S, (2,2)=S, (2,3)=S.\nRow 3: #AS ASS# → Let's parse this. Column 1: A, 2:S, 3: space, 4:A, 5:S, 6:S. So (3,1)=A, (3,2)=S, (3,4)=A, (3,5)=S, (3,6)=S.\nRow 4: # SSSSS# → columns 1-5 are S. So (4,1)=S, (4,2)=S, (4,3)=S, (4,4)=S, (4,5)=S.\nRow 5: #S  A S# → columns 1:S, 2: space, 3: space, 4:A, 5:S, 6:S. So (5,1)=S, (5,4)=A, (5,5)=S.\nRow 6: #SSSSSS# → columns 1-6 are S. So (6,1)=S, (6,2)=S, (6,3)=S, (6,4)=S, (6,5)=S, (6,6)=S.\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe snake's head is at (1,1). Since the current direction is LEFT, the next move would be to (1,0) if moving LEFT. But (1,0) is a wall (since row 1 starts with # at column 0). So moving LEFT would cause a collision with the wall, which ends the game. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP or DOWN. Let's check each.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, so next direction can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT (but LEFT is into a wall, so invalid). So only UP or DOWN are possible.\n\nFirst, check UP direction. The head is at (1,1). Moving UP would take it to (0,1), which is a wall (row 0 is all #). So moving UP would hit the wall. So UP is invalid.\n\nNext, check DOWN direction. The head is at (1,1). Moving DOWN would take it to (2,1). What's at (2,1)? Looking at row 2, column 1: 'S' (from row 2: # SSS  #). So (2,1) is part of the snake's body. So moving DOWN would cause a collision with itself, which ends the game.\n\nWait, that's a problem. All possible directions (LEFT, UP, DOWN) lead to collisions? Let's recheck.\n\nWait, the current direction is LEFT, so the next direction can be LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Because RIGHT is the reverse and not allowed.\n\nCurrent head position: (1,1). Let's confirm coordinates. Rows are 0-7, top to bottom. So row 0 is the top wall, row 7 the bottom. Columns 0 is left wall, 7 right.\n\nRow 1 is the second row (since row 0 is top). So row 1's columns: 0 is # (wall), 1 is H, 2 is S, 3 is S, 4 is space, 5 is space, 6 is space, 7 is #. So head is at (row 1, column 1).\n\nMoving LEFT (current direction) would take the head to (row 1, column 0), which is a wall. So collision.\n\nMoving UP: row 1-1=0, column 1. Row 0, column 1 is a wall. Collision.\n\nMoving DOWN: row 1+1=2, column 1. Row 2, column 1: looking at row 2's string: \"# SSS  #\", which is columns 0: #, 1: S, 2:S, 3:S, 4: space, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So (2,1) is S (body). So moving down into S (body) → collision.\n\nMoving RIGHT: direction is reverse (current is LEFT, so RIGHT is reverse). So not allowed. So the player can't choose RIGHT.\n\nSo all possible directions (LEFT, UP, DOWN) lead to collision. Therefore, whatever direction the player chooses, the game ends. But the player has to choose one of the four directions, but according to the rules, the snake can't reverse direction. So the allowed directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT. But all of these directions result in collision. So the answer would be any of them, but the game ends.\n\nBut the question is, what direction should the player choose? Since all options lead to game over, but perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me double-check.\n\nLet me re-express the board row by row with coordinates:\n\nRow 0 (index 0): columns 0-7: all '#' → (0,0) to (0,7) are #.\nRow 1 (index 1): \"# HSS  #\" → columns 0: #, 1:H, 2:S, 3:S, 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: # → positions (1,1)=H, (1,2)=S, (1,3)=S.\nRow 2 (index 2): \"# SSS  #\" → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: # → (2,1)=S, (2,2)=S, (2,3)=S.\nRow 3 (index 3): \"#AS ASS#\" → columns 0: #, 1:A, 2:S, 3: ' ', 4:A, 5:S, 6:S, 7: # → (3,1)=A, (3,2)=S, (3,4)=A, (3,5)=S, (3,6)=S.\nRow 4 (index 4): \"# SSSSS#\" → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 5:S, 6: ' ', 7: # → (4,1)=S, (4,2)=S, (4,3)=S, (4,4)=S, (4,5)=S.\nRow 5 (index 5): \"#S  A S#\" → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4:A, 5:S, 6:S, 7: # → (5,1)=S, (5,4)=A, (5,5)=S, (5,6)=S.\nRow 6 (index 6): \"#SSSSSS#\" → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S, 7: # → (6,1)=S, (6,2)=S, (6,3)=S, (6,4)=S, (6,5)=S, (6,6)=S.\nRow 7 (index 7): all '#' → (7,0)-(7,7) are #.\n\nSo head is at (1,1). Current direction is LEFT. The next move direction options are LEFT, UP, DOWN (since RIGHT is reverse, which is invalid).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT: next head position is (1, 0). (1,0) is a wall (row 1, column 0 is '#'). So collision with wall → game over.\n\n2. UP: next head position is (0,1). (0,1) is a wall (row 0, column 1 is '#'). Collision with wall → game over.\n\n3. DOWN: next head position is (2,1). (2,1) is 'S' (snake's body). Collision with self → game over.\n\n4. RIGHT: direction is reverse (current direction is LEFT, so RIGHT is reverse). Not allowed. So the player can't choose RIGHT. So even if they try, it's invalid, but according to the problem statement, the direction given must be one of the four. But the snake can't reverse direction, so if the player chooses RIGHT, the snake would ignore it and continue in current direction? Or does the player have to choose a valid direction? The problem says \"The Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\". So the player must choose one of these, but the snake can't reverse. So if the player chooses RIGHT (reverse), the snake would not change direction and continue moving LEFT. So in that case, the next move is LEFT, which is into the wall, leading to collision.\n\nSo regardless of the direction chosen (LEFT, UP, DOWN, RIGHT), the snake will collide. Because:\n\n- Choosing LEFT: move to (1,0) → wall.\n- Choosing UP: move to (0,1) → wall.\n- Choosing DOWN: move to (2,1) → body.\n- Choosing RIGHT: since it's reverse, snake continues moving LEFT → (1,0) → wall.\n\nThus, all possible directions result in game over. So the answer can be any of the directions, but the game ends.\n\n\n########\n# HSS  #\n# SSS  #\n#AS ASS#\n# SSSSS#\n#S  A S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT.

I need to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, let's start by understanding the current game state. \n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around the edges. The current board given is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is 'H' at position (let's index rows from top to bottom, columns left to right). Let's map the positions. The rows are 0 to 7 (since it's 8x8). \n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #      # (columns 1-6 are empty)\nRow 2: #   A  # → so column 4 is 'A' (since positions 1: #, 2: space, 3: space, 4: A, 5: space, 6: #)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #  H   # → H is at column 3 (positions 1: #, 2: space, 3: H, 4: space, 5: space, 6: #)\nRow 5: #      # (empty)\nRow 6: #  A A # → columns 3 and 5 are A (positions 1: #, 2: space, 3: A, 4: space, 5: A, 6: #)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. The snake's length is 1 (only the head), so there's no body yet. The current epoch is 1, so we have 99 more epochs left before the game ends.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is UP, the snake can't immediately go DOWN. The possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because reversing (to DOWN) is not allowed.\n\nLet's think about where the head will move next based on the direction chosen.\n\nFirst, current head position: row 4, column 3 (assuming row 0 is top). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 4 is \"#  H   #\", which is characters: index 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is 'H', 4 is ' ', 5 is ' ', 6 is '#'. So yes, row 4, column 3.\n\nIf the direction is UP (current direction), the next position is row 3, column 3. Let's check row 3: \"#      #\". So row 3, column 3 is a space. That's safe. No collision. The snake moves there, and since it's not an apple, the snake doesn't grow. The new head is at (3,3), and since length is 1, the previous head position (4,3) becomes empty (since the snake moves forward, no body yet). \n\nIf direction is LEFT: the snake would turn left (from UP, left is allowed). The new position would be row 4, column 2. Let's check that cell. Row 4, column 2 is a space (since row 4 is \"#  H   #\", so column 2 is ' '). So that's safe. No collision. \n\nIf direction is RIGHT: the new position is row 4, column 4. Let's check row 4, column 4: that's a space (since H is at 3, so 4 is space). Safe.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: that's reversing direction (current is UP, so DOWN is reverse). Not allowed. So the possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's see where the apples are. The apples are at:\n\nRow 2, column 4 (A)\nRow 6, column 3 (A)\nRow 6, column 5 (A)\n\nCurrent head is at (4,3). Let's see the positions of apples relative to the head.\n\nThe apple in row 2, column 4 is two rows up (4-2=2 rows up) and 1 column to the right (4-3=1). The apples in row 6 are two rows down (6-4=2) and 0 (row 6, column 3) or 2 columns right (row 6, column 5).\n\nThe snake is moving UP. Let's think about which direction would lead to an apple next.\n\nIf we keep moving UP (current direction), the next head position is (3,3). Then, in the next steps, moving UP again would take us to (2,3). Let's check row 2: \"#   A  #\". Row 2, column 3 is a space (since the A is at column 4). So (2,3) is safe, then moving UP again (to row 1, column 3) which is empty, then row 0 (wall, which is bad). So moving UP might lead towards the apple at row 2, column 4. To reach that apple, from (4,3), moving up to (3,3), then maybe right to (3,4), then up to (2,4) which is the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we turn RIGHT now (direction RIGHT), the head moves to (4,4). Then, next possible moves could be up (since current direction would be RIGHT, so can't reverse to LEFT). From (4,4), moving up (direction UP) would take to (3,4). Then up to (2,4), which is the apple. That's a shorter path. Let's check:\n\nCurrent head (4,3). If direction is RIGHT, next head is (4,4). Then, next move direction could be UP (since from RIGHT, turning UP is allowed). Then (3,4). Then (2,4) which is the apple. So that's 3 steps to reach that apple.\n\nIf we go UP first (direction UP), head moves to (3,3). Then, direction could be RIGHT (since current direction is UP, turning RIGHT is allowed). Then head moves to (3,4). Then up to (2,4) (the apple). That's also 3 steps. So same number of steps.\n\nAnother apple is in row 6, column 3. The head is at (4,3). To reach that, moving down (but current direction is UP, can't reverse to DOWN immediately). So if the snake first moves UP, then maybe down later. But that's risky. Because after moving up, the snake could turn around, but that might take longer. Also, moving down would require changing direction, but the snake can't reverse. For example, if current direction is UP, after moving up once (to 3,3), the direction could be changed to DOWN (since that's not reversing the previous direction, which was UP). Wait, no. The rule says the snake cannot reverse its direction. Reversing is turning from UP to DOWN, or LEFT to RIGHT. So after moving UP, the current direction is UP. If you then choose DOWN, that's reversing, which is not allowed. Oh right, the direction can't be reversed. So the direction can only be changed to left or right relative to current direction. For example, if moving UP, possible next directions are UP (continue), LEFT (turn left from up, which is left), RIGHT (turn right from up, which is right). So to go down, you can't do that unless you first turn left or right, then down.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at row 6, column 3 is directly below the current head (same column, row 6 is two rows down from row 4). So (4,3) → (5,3) → (6,3) (the apple). But to get to (5,3), the snake would have to move down. But current direction is UP, so can't reverse to DOWN. So the snake would need to first change direction to, say, LEFT or RIGHT, then move down. Let's see:\n\nIf the snake first moves LEFT (direction LEFT), then the head moves to (4,2). Then, the current direction is LEFT, so next possible directions are LEFT (continue), UP (turn up from left), DOWN (turn down from left). Oh, wait. The direction reversal rule: when moving in a direction, you can't reverse. So if current direction is LEFT, you can't go RIGHT. So, if the snake is moving LEFT, possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. Because reversing LEFT would be RIGHT, which is not allowed. So, for example, if the snake is moving UP, possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse). If moving RIGHT, possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN (LEFT is reverse). If moving DOWN, possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (UP is reverse). If moving LEFT, possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN (RIGHT is reverse). \n\nSo, if the snake is currently moving UP, and the player chooses to go LEFT, then the new direction is LEFT. Then, the next move would be in the LEFT direction (so head moves to (4,1) if next direction is LEFT again). But if after moving LEFT once (direction LEFT), the player could choose DOWN. Because from LEFT, direction DOWN is allowed (since reverse of LEFT is RIGHT). So moving from LEFT to DOWN is allowed. So perhaps that's a path to reach the apple at (6,3).\n\nBut let's get back. The current epoch is 1, so we have 99 steps. The snake's goal is to eat as many apples as possible. So the best immediate move is to go towards the nearest apple.\n\nThe apple at row 2, column 4 is (row 2, column 4). The head is at (4,3). The distance (Manhattan) is (4-2) + (4-3) = 2 +1=3. The apples at row 6, column 3: (6-4)+(3-3)=2+0=2. The apple at row 6, column5: (6-4)+(5-3)=2+2=4. So the closest apple is the one at (6,3) (distance 2). But to reach that, the snake needs to move down. But current direction is UP. So how?\n\nCurrent head position (4,3). To get to (6,3), the snake needs to move down two steps. But current direction is UP, so the first move can't be DOWN. So first, the snake must change direction to something else, then move down.\n\nLet's think: if the snake first moves DOWN (but that's reverse of UP, which is not allowed). So that's invalid. So the snake can't move down in the first step.\n\nAlternative approach: move in a direction that allows the snake to turn towards the apple.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is directly below the head (same column). So if the snake can move down, it can reach there. But first, the direction must not be reversed.\n\nSo, current direction is UP. Possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf the snake moves UP (direction UP), then the new head is (3,3). Now the direction is still UP. Next possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. To get down from here, the snake would need to change direction. For example, after moving UP to (3,3), the direction could be changed to LEFT. Then, the next move is LEFT to (3,2). Then direction could be changed to DOWN (since from LEFT, DOWN is allowed). Then, moving DOWN to (4,2), then (5,2), (6,2). But that's not the apple's position (6,3). So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, after moving UP to (3,3), direction could be changed to RIGHT. Then, head moves to (3,4). Then direction could be changed to DOWN (since from RIGHT, DOWN is allowed). Then moving down to (4,4), (5,4), (6,4). The apple at (6,5) is there. But that's a different apple.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the apple at (2,4). The head is at (4,3). If the snake moves RIGHT (direction RIGHT), then head moves to (4,4). Then, direction can be UP (since from RIGHT, UP is allowed). Then, moving UP to (3,4), then UP to (2,4), which is the apple. That's two moves after the first direction change. So in epoch 1, direction RIGHT: head moves to (4,4). Epoch 2: direction UP, head moves to (3,4). Epoch 3: direction UP, head moves to (2,4) (apple). Then, the snake eats the apple, grows, and score increases.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP first (epoch 1: direction UP, head to (3,3)), then epoch 2: direction RIGHT (head to (3,4)), epoch 3: direction UP (head to (2,4)) → same result. So both paths take 3 steps to reach that apple.\n\nBut the apple at (6,3) is closer (distance 2). Let's see if there's a way to reach it. The head is at (4,3). To reach (6,3), need to move down twice. But first move can't be down. So let's see:\n\nEpoch 1: possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's say we choose to move LEFT (direction LEFT). Then, head moves to (4,2). Now, current direction is LEFT. Next possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN (since reverse is RIGHT). So epoch 2: direction DOWN (allowed, since from LEFT, DOWN is not reverse). Then, head moves to (5,2). Epoch 3: direction RIGHT (current direction is DOWN, so can't reverse to UP. Possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. So direction RIGHT: head moves to (5,3). Epoch 4: direction DOWN (current direction is RIGHT, possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN. So direction DOWN: head moves to (6,3) (apple). That's 4 steps. So longer than the other apple.\n\nAlternatively, epoch 1: direction RIGHT (head to 4,4). Then, direction DOWN (since from RIGHT, direction DOWN is allowed). Epoch 2: head to 5,4. Epoch 3: direction LEFT (current direction is DOWN, possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. So LEFT: head to 5,3. Epoch 4: direction DOWN: head to 6,3 (apple). Also 4 steps.\n\nSo the apple at (2,4) is reachable in 3 steps (epoch 1: RIGHT → (4,4), epoch 2: UP → (3,4), epoch 3: UP → (2,4) (apple)). That's better.\n\nSo the best immediate move would be to go RIGHT, to start moving towards that apple. Because moving RIGHT now positions the head in (4,4), which is one step closer to (2,4).\n\nLet's confirm the positions again.\n\nCurrent head: (4,3). If direction is RIGHT, the new head position is (4,4). Let's check that cell. Row 4 is \"#  H   #\". So column 4 is a space (since H is at column 3). So (4,4) is safe. No collision (no walls, no body). So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nIf direction is UP, head moves to (3,3). Also safe.\n\nIf direction is LEFT, head moves to (4,2). Safe.\n\nSo all three directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe. But which one leads to the apple fastest.\n\nThe apple at (2,4) is in row 2, column 4. So if we move RIGHT (to 4,4), then moving UP twice (to 3,4 then 2,4) would reach the apple. That's 3 steps (epoch 1: RIGHT, epoch 2: UP, epoch 3: UP). \n\nIf we move UP first (epoch 1: UP to 3,3), then RIGHT (epoch 2: RIGHT to 3,4), then UP (epoch 3: UP to 2,4) → also 3 steps.\n\nSo either direction (UP then RIGHT, or RIGHT then UP) would reach the apple in the same steps. But perhaps moving RIGHT now is better because it's a more direct path towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP is better. Let's see.\n\nIf we move UP (current direction), the head is at (3,3). Then, the next possible direction could be RIGHT (allowed, since current direction is UP). So head moves to (3,4). Then, direction UP again, head to (2,4) (apple). That's three steps. So same as moving RIGHT first.\n\nBut what's the current direction after each move? Let's track:\n\nCase 1: Epoch 1 direction is RIGHT.\n\n- Epoch 1: direction RIGHT. Head moves from (4,3) to (4,4). New direction is RIGHT.\n\nEpoch 2: possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN (since can't reverse to LEFT). So to go towards the apple (2,4), we need to go up. So direction UP. Head moves from (4,4) to (3,4). New direction is UP.\n\nEpoch 3: possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't reverse to DOWN). So direction UP. Head moves from (3,4) to (2,4) (apple). Eat apple, score increases. That works.\n\nCase 2: Epoch 1 direction is UP.\n\n- Epoch 1: direction UP. Head moves from (4,3) to (3,3). New direction is UP.\n\nEpoch 2: possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. So direction RIGHT. Head moves from (3,3) to (3,4). New direction is RIGHT.\n\nEpoch 3: possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN. So direction UP. Head moves from (3,4) to (2,4) (apple). Also works.\n\nEither way, it's possible. So which direction to choose now? The question is which initial direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) is better. Since all are safe, but the apple at (2,4) is the closest (distance 3), and moving towards it is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better option. Let's check if any of the directions leads to immediate apple consumption. The current head is at (4,3). Are any adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) containing an apple?\n\nUp: (3,3) → empty.\n\nDown: (5,3) → row 5 is \"#      #\", so (5,3) is empty.\n\nLeft: (4,2) → empty.\n\nRight: (4,4) → empty.\n\nSo none of the adjacent cells have an apple. So the snake can't eat an apple in the first move. So the next best thing is to move towards the nearest apple.\n\nThe apples are at (2,4), (6,3), (6,5).\n\nThe Manhattan distance from (4,3) to (2,4) is (4-2) + (4-3) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nTo (6,3): (6-4) + (3-3) = 2 + 0 = 2.\n\nTo (6,5): (6-4) + (5-3) = 2 + 2 =4.\n\nSo (6,3) is the closest. But to reach it, the snake needs to move down. But current direction is UP, so can't reverse. So the snake has to take a longer path.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is in row 6, column 3. The head is in row 4, column 3. So two steps down (row 5, column 3; row 6, column 3). But first step down is not allowed (current direction is UP, can't reverse to DOWN). So the snake needs to move in another direction first, then down.\n\nFor example:\n\nEpoch 1: direction LEFT → (4,2).\n\nEpoch 2: direction DOWN → (5,2).\n\nEpoch 3: direction RIGHT → (5,3).\n\nEpoch 4: direction DOWN → (6,3) (apple). That's 4 steps.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nEpoch 1: direction RIGHT → (4,4).\n\nEpoch 2: direction DOWN → (5,4).\n\nEpoch 3: direction LEFT → (5,3).\n\nEpoch 4: direction DOWN → (6,3). Also 4 steps.\n\nSo that's 4 steps to reach (6,3). The apple at (2,4) is 3 steps. So better to go for (2,4).\n\nSo moving towards (2,4) is better.\n\nSo in the first move, which direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) is better to reach (2,4) faster.\n\nIf we move RIGHT now (epoch 1), then next steps can be UP, UP. Let's see:\n\nEpoch 1: direction RIGHT → head at (4,4).\n\nEpoch 2: direction UP → head at (3,4).\n\nEpoch 3: direction UP → head at (2,4) (apple). That's 3 steps. Perfect.\n\nYes. So moving RIGHT in epoch 1 allows the snake to reach the apple in 3 steps. So that's the best option.\n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at row 4, column 3 (0-indexed rows\/columns).\n- **Apples**: Three apples are located at (row 2, column 4), (row 6, column 3), and (row 6, column 5).\n- **Current Direction**: The snake is moving UP. Reversing direction (to DOWN) is not allowed. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n- **Goal**: Move toward the nearest apple to maximize score.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 3, column 3). This is safe but does not directly approach the nearest apples.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 4, column 2). This is safe but moves away from the closest apples.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 4, column 4). This positions the snake closer to the apple at (row 2, column 4) (Manhattan distance 3), which is the nearest accessible apple.\n\n### Optimal Path:\nMoving RIGHT (current step) allows the snake to approach the apple at (row 2, column 4) efficiently. Subsequent moves (UP, UP) would reach the apple in 3 steps, maximizing the chance to eat it before other apples or wall collisions.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to look at the current game board and the current direction. The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake's head is at position (4,4) if we count rows from top starting at 0. Let's map the board properly.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (walls)\nRow 1: #      # (columns 1-6 are empty)\nRow 2: #   A  # (so column 4 is A here, since row 2, columns 1-6: positions 2,3,4,5. So \"   A  \" means column 4 is A)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #   H  # (H is at column 4, row 4)\nRow 5: #      # (empty)\nRow 6: #  A A # (columns 3 and 5 are A)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at (4,4) (row 4, column 4). The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake is moving to the right. Let's think about possible moves. The snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is RIGHT, the possible directions the player can choose are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since reversing would be LEFT, which is not allowed).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. RIGHT: The next position would be (4,5). Let's see what's there. Row 4 is \"#   H  #\", so columns 1-6 are positions 1 to 6. So row 4, column 5 is a space (since H is at 4, so columns 3,4,5: \"  H \" → columns 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: ' '). So moving RIGHT would take H to (4,5), which is empty. No collision, no apple. The snake would move there. Then, the body (since snake length is 1, after moving, the previous head position (4,4) becomes part of the body? Wait, initial length is 1, so when it moves, the head moves, and the body is the previous positions. So when the snake moves, the head moves to new position, and if it didn't eat an apple, the tail (since length is 1) would just be the previous head. Wait, no: snake starts with length 1 (only head). When it moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the snake's length remains 1, so the new head is the new position, and the old head position is no longer part of the snake. Because if the length is 1, moving forward just shifts the head. So, if the snake moves RIGHT from (4,4) to (4,5), the new head is (4,5), and the old position (4,4) is now empty. So no body. So that's safe.\n\n2. UP: Current direction is RIGHT. UP is allowed (not reverse). Moving UP would take the head from (4,4) to (3,4). Let's check row 3: \"#      #\", so column 4 is empty. So (3,4) is empty. Safe.\n\n3. DOWN: Moving DOWN from (4,4) would go to (5,4). Row 5 is \"#      #\", column 4 is empty. Safe.\n\nNow, we need to check if any of these directions lead to apples, to increase the score. Let's see where the apples are.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 2: column 4 is A (position (2,4))\n\nRow 6: columns 3 and 5 are A (positions (6,3) and (6,5))\n\nCurrent head is (4,4). Let's see possible next positions:\n\n- If direction is RIGHT: (4,5). Is there an apple there? Let's check row 4, column 5: the original row 4 is \"#   H  #\", so H is at column 4, so the row is: columns 1: '#', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (4,5) is empty. No apple.\n\n- If direction is UP: (3,4). Check row 3, column 4: row 3 is \"#      #\", which is all spaces. No apple.\n\n- If direction is DOWN: (5,4). Row 5 is \"#      #\", column 4 is empty. No apple.\n\nWait, what about other apples? Let's check the other positions. The snake's next move is only one step, so we need to see if any adjacent square (based on direction) has an apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the apple positions. Let's recheck:\n\nOriginal board:\n\nRow 0: ########\n\nRow 1: #      # → columns 1-6 are empty.\n\nRow 2: #   A  # → Let's break down the characters. The row starts with '#', then 3 spaces, then 'A', then 2 spaces, then '#'. So positions in row 2 (columns 0 to 7):\n\n0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\n\nSo apple at (2,4).\n\nRow 3: #      # → columns 1-6 are all ' '.\n\nRow 4: #   H  # → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\n\nSo H is at (4,4).\n\nRow 5: #      # → columns 1-6 are ' '.\n\nRow 6: #  A A # → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\n\nSo apples at (6,3) and (6,5).\n\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo the apples are at (2,4), (6,3), (6,5).\n\nNow, the current head is at (4,4). Let's see the possible next positions for each direction:\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So the snake is moving right. The player can choose to turn UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (can't go LEFT).\n\nIf the player chooses UP: new head position is (3,4). Check if (3,4) has an apple. (3,4) is in row 3, column 4. Row 3 is all spaces, so no apple. So snake moves there, no growth.\n\nIf the player chooses DOWN: new head position is (5,4). Check (5,4): row 5, column 4 is ' ', no apple.\n\nIf the player chooses RIGHT: new head position is (4,5). Check (4,5): row 4, column 5 is ' ', no apple.\n\nSo none of the immediate next moves will eat an apple. So the priority is to avoid walls and self-collision, and perhaps move towards apples.\n\nNow, let's check if any direction leads to a wall. The snake's head is at (4,4). The board's walls are at the edges (row 0 and 7, column 0 and 7). So:\n\n- Moving UP: (3,4). Row 3 is within 1-6 (since rows 0 and 7 are walls), so safe.\n\n- Moving DOWN: (5,4). Row 5 is safe.\n\n- Moving RIGHT: (4,5). Column 5 is within 1-6 (columns 0 and 7 are walls), so safe.\n\nSo all directions are safe. Now, which direction is best to reach an apple? Let's see the positions of the apples.\n\nApple at (2,4): that's two rows above the current head (row 4 → row 3 → row 2). So if the snake moves UP, then next move could be UP again (if possible) to reach (2,4). Let's see:\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. If we choose UP now, the new direction is UP. Then, in the next epoch, the snake can continue moving UP (since direction can't reverse, so possible directions would be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP). If we keep moving UP, then from (3,4) to (2,4), which is the apple. So that's a possible path.\n\nAnother apple is at (6,3) and (6,5). Let's see:\n\nApple (6,3): row 6, column 3. Current head is (4,4). To get there, need to move down two rows (to row 6) and left one column (from 4 to 3). If the snake moves DOWN now, then direction is DOWN. Then next moves could be DOWN again, then LEFT.\n\nApple (6,5): row 6, column 5. From (4,4), moving RIGHT (to 4,5), then DOWN (to 5,5), then DOWN (to 6,5). That's an apple.\n\nSo which is closer? Let's calculate steps:\n\nTo reach (2,4):\n\nCurrent head (4,4) → move UP to (3,4) (epoch 2 → 3). Then move UP again (epoch 3 →4) to (2,4). So 2 steps.\n\nTo reach (6,5):\n\nCurrent head (4,4) → move RIGHT to (4,5) (epoch 2→3). Then move DOWN to (5,5) (epoch 3→4). Then move DOWN to (6,5) (epoch 4→5). That's 3 steps.\n\nApple (6,3): (4,4) → move DOWN to (5,4) (epoch 2→3). Then move DOWN to (6,4) (epoch 3→4). Then move LEFT to (6,3) (epoch 4→5). 3 steps.\n\nSo the closest apple is (2,4), which can be reached in 2 steps if we go UP now. So choosing UP direction now would allow the snake to move towards that apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we continue moving RIGHT, then next position is (4,5). Then, perhaps moving DOWN towards (6,5) apple. But that's 3 steps. So UP is better.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake can't reverse direction. So if current direction is RIGHT, and we choose UP, then the new direction is UP. Then, in the next step, possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since can't reverse to DOWN). So moving UP again would be allowed.\n\nSo the best direction here is UP, to approach the apple at (2,4) in the next steps.\n\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the snake's head is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4). The snake can choose to move UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since reversing to LEFT is not allowed). \n\n- **RIGHT**: The head would move to (4,5), which is empty (no apple, no collision).  \n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (5,4), which is empty (no apple, no collision).  \n- **UP**: The head would move to (3,4), which is empty (no apple, no collision).  \n\nNone of these immediate moves eat an apple, but the closest apple is at (2,4) (row 2, column 4). Moving UP now positions the snake to reach this apple in the next step (by moving UP again). This path is shorter than paths to the other apples (at (6,3) and (6,5)), which would take more steps.  \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's situation. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the epoch is 3. The snake's head is at position (let's map the rows from top to bottom as 0-7). The top row is row 0, which is all '#'s. Then row 1 is \"#      #\", so row 1, column 3 (since it's 0-indexed) would be the middle. Wait, let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7)\nRow 1: #      # → columns 1-6 are empty, so (1,1) to (1,6) are spaces.\nRow 2: #   A  # → so column 3 has 'A' (since 1 is #, 2 is space, 3 is A, 4 space, 5 space, 6 #)\nRow 3: #   H  # → column 3 has 'H' (head)\nRow 4: #      # → empty\nRow 5: #      # → empty\nRow 6: #  A A # → columns 2 and 4 have 'A's (since 1 is #, 2 is A, 3 space, 4 A, 5 space, 6 #)\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo the head 'H' is at (3,3). The current direction is UP. The snake is moving up, which means the next position the head would go is row 2, column 3. Let's check what's there. Row 2, column 3 is 'A' (from row 2: #   A  #). So if the snake continues moving UP, the head will move to (2,3), which is an apple. Eating that apple would make the snake grow. The snake's length is currently 1 (only head), so after eating, the length becomes 2. The new head would be at (2,3), and the previous head (3,3) becomes 'S' (body part). \n\nNow, the question is: what direction should we choose? The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is UP, so reversing would be DOWN. So we can't choose DOWN. So possible directions are UP (continue), LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check the possible next moves:\n\n1. If we choose UP (current direction):\n   Next head position: (2,3) which is 'A'. Eating the apple. The new head is (2,3), previous head (3,3) becomes 'S'. The snake grows. No collision (since (2,3) is apple, not wall or body). So this is safe and gains a point.\n\n2. If we choose LEFT:\n   The new direction is LEFT. The snake was moving UP, so turning left is allowed (since not reversing). The next head position would be (3,2). Let's check (3,2): in row 3, the string is \"#   H  #\", so column 2 is space. So (3,2) is empty. The snake moves there. The previous head (3,3) becomes 'S' (since the snake's length is 1, moving to a new cell would leave the old head as body). So the new head is (3,2), body at (3,3). No collision. But no apple eaten here.\n\n3. If we choose RIGHT:\n   Direction RIGHT. Next head position is (3,4). Check (3,4): row 3 is \"#   H  #\", so column 4 is space. So (3,4) is empty. Move there. Previous head (3,3) becomes 'S'. No apple, no collision.\n\nSo the best option is to continue moving UP, because that's the direction where there's an apple. Eating the apple will increase the score and the snake grows. The other directions don't have apples immediately. So choosing UP is the best choice here.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (row 3, column 3). The current direction is UP, meaning the snake is moving upward. The snake cannot reverse direction, so DOWN is not allowed. \n\n- If the direction remains UP: The next head position will be (row 2, column 3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1, and the snake will grow (the previous head position (3,3) will become a body segment 'S'). This move is safe (no collision with walls or itself) and gains a point.\n- If the direction is LEFT: The next head position will be (row 3, column 2), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake moves without growing.\n- If the direction is RIGHT: The next head position will be (row 3, column 4), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake moves without growing.\n\nThe optimal choice is to continue moving UP to eat the apple and grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls around. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A     # (so positions (1,1) is A, others empty)\nRow 2: #   H  # (positions (2,3) is H, the head)\nRow 3: #   S  # (positions (3,3) is S, the body)\nRow 4: #      # (empty)\nRow 5: #      # (empty)\nRow 6: #  A A # (positions (6,2) and (6,4) are A)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. The snake's head is at (2,3) (row 2, column 3). The body is at (3,3), which is directly below the head, since the current direction is UP. So the snake's length is 2 (head and one body segment). \n\nThe next move depends on the direction we choose. The snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is UP, the snake can't go DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. UP: The new head position would be (1,3). Let's check what's there. Row 1, column 3: looking at row 1 \"#A     #\", columns 0 is #, 1 is A, 2-6 are empty (assuming 0-based indices). So (1,3) is empty (since row 1 is #A followed by 5 spaces and #, so columns 0: #, 1: A, 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #). So moving UP to (1,3) is safe. But is there an apple there? (1,3) is empty. So the snake would move, and the body would follow. The new body positions would be the previous head (2,3) becomes S, and the previous body (3,3) might stay? Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. Since the snake's current body is (3,3), when the head moves up to (1,3), the body would be (2,3) (the old head) and (3,3) (the old body) would stay only if the snake grows. But since it's not eating an apple, the length remains 2. So after moving UP, the head is (1,3), body is (2,3), and (3,3) is no longer part of the body (since the snake is length 2). Wait, no. The snake's body segments are the previous positions of the head. So for a snake of length 2, the head is H at (2,3), and the body S is at (3,3). When moving UP, the new head is (1,3). The body then moves to where the head was, so (2,3) becomes S, and the previous S at (3,3) is removed (since the snake's length is 2). So the new positions would be H at (1,3), S at (2,3), and (3,3) is empty. That's safe. No collision with walls or self.\n\n2. LEFT: The direction would be LEFT. Since current direction is UP, turning left is allowed (not reversing). The new head position would be (2,2) (row 2, column 2). Let's check (2,2): row 2 is \"#   H  #\", which is columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: H, 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (2,2) is empty. So moving left to (2,2) is safe. No collision. Then the body would be (2,3) (old head) and (3,3) (old body). The snake's length remains 2. So no problem.\n\n3. RIGHT: Direction RIGHT. Current direction is UP, so allowed. New head position (2,4). Row 2, column 4: row 2 is \"#   H  #\", so column 4 is ' ' (since H is at 3, 4 is to the right of H). So (2,4) is empty. Moving right is safe. Body would be (2,3) and (3,3) as before.\n\nNow, we need to check if any of these directions leads to eating an apple. Let's check the positions:\n\nPossible next positions for the head:\n\n- UP: (1,3) → row 1, column 3. The row 1 is \"#A     #\". Column 1 is A, others in row 1 are empty. So (1,3) is ' ', no apple.\n\n- LEFT: (2,2) → row 2, column 2. Row 2 is \"#   H  #\", so column 2 is ' ', no apple.\n\n- RIGHT: (2,4) → row 2, column 4. Also ' ', no apple.\n\nWhat about moving in the current direction (UP) and then the next steps? Let's think about apples on the board. The apples are at (1,1), (6,2), (6,4).\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,3). Let's see the positions of the apples:\n\nApple 1: (1,1) → row 1, column 1.\n\nApple 2: (6,2) → row 6, column 2.\n\nApple 3: (6,4) → row 6, column 4.\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. If the snake continues moving UP, next position (1,3), then maybe next move could be LEFT towards (1,2), (1,1) which is an apple. But if we turn LEFT now, the head would go to (2,2). Then next moves could be UP towards (1,2), then (1,1) (the apple). Alternatively, moving RIGHT now would take the head to (2,4), which is further from the apples. Let's check the positions.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's body is at (3,3). So if the snake moves UP, then the body is at (2,3), which is the previous head. So if the snake then moves UP again, head at (0,3) which is a wall (row 0 is all #), so that's a collision. So moving UP twice would hit the top wall. So moving UP once is safe, but the next move in UP would be bad. So perhaps UP is not the best choice.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT now: new head (2,2). Then possible next directions (since current direction would be LEFT). The snake can't reverse (so can't go RIGHT). Next directions could be UP, LEFT, or DOWN. Let's see: moving LEFT again would take the head to (2,1). Then (2,1) is in row 2: \"#   H  #\", column 1 is ' ', so safe. Then next move, perhaps UP to (1,1), which is the apple at (1,1). That's an apple! So if we move LEFT now, then LEFT again, then UP, we can reach that apple. But let's check:\n\nCurrent head (2,3) → move LEFT to (2,2) (direction LEFT now). Then next move (epoch 5), direction LEFT again: head (2,1). Then epoch 6, direction UP: head (1,1), which is the apple. That would be good. So moving LEFT now could lead to eating that apple in a few steps.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now: head (2,4). Then direction is RIGHT. Next move RIGHT to (2,5), then maybe DOWN towards row 6 where the other apples are. The apples at (6,2) and (6,4). If the snake is at (2,4), moving DOWN would take it towards row 3, 4, 5, 6. Let's see: (2,4) → move DOWN (since direction is RIGHT, next direction could be DOWN). Then (3,4). Then (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) which is an apple. That's the apple at (6,4). So moving RIGHT now, then DOWN, then DOWN, etc., could reach (6,4) in a few steps.\n\nWhich path is better? Let's check distances. The apple at (1,1) is (2,3) → (2,2) → (2,1) → (1,1): 3 moves (current epoch 4, so epoch 5: LEFT, epoch 6: LEFT, epoch 7: UP. Then eat apple at epoch 7).\n\nThe apple at (6,4) is (2,3) → (2,4) → (3,4) → (4,4) → (5,4) → (6,4): 4 moves (epoch 5: RIGHT, epoch 6: DOWN, epoch 7: DOWN, epoch 8: DOWN, epoch 9: DOWN. Then eat at epoch 9). So the apple at (1,1) is closer.\n\nAnother apple at (6,2): (2,3) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (4,2) → (5,2) → (6,2): 5 moves. So (1,1) is closest.\n\nSo the best approach is to head towards (1,1). So moving LEFT now (epoch 4) would start that path. Let's confirm the movement.\n\nCurrent direction is UP. If we choose LEFT, that's allowed (since not reversing). The head moves from (2,3) to (2,2). The body moves from (3,3) to (2,3). So the new board after moving LEFT would be:\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: #A     #\nRow 2: #  H   # (H at (2,2))\nRow 3: #   S  # (S at (2,3))? Wait, no. Let's think again. The snake's body is the previous positions of the head. The snake's length is 2. So when the head moves, the body is the previous head. So original positions: H at (2,3), S at (3,3). When moving LEFT, the new head is (2,2). The body (S) will be at (2,3) (the old head). The previous S at (3,3) is no longer part of the body (since length is 2). So row 3 would have (3,3) as empty. Let's reconstruct the new board after moving LEFT:\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: #A     #\nRow 2: #  H   # (H at (2,2))\nRow 3: #   S  # → No, row 3, column 3 was S, but after moving, the body is now at (2,3). So row 2, column 3 is S. Let's correct:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow 2: #   H  # → (2,3) is H.\n\nRow 3: #   S  # → (3,3) is S.\n\nAfter moving LEFT, the new H is at (2,2). The body (S) is at (2,3) (the previous H position). The previous S at (3,3) is no longer part of the body (since the snake is length 2, so only head and one body segment). So row 3, column 3 becomes empty. So row 3 would be \"#     #\".\n\nSo the new board after moving LEFT would be:\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: #A     #\nRow 2: #  H S # (H at (2,2), S at (2,3))\nRow 3: #      #\nRow 4: #      #\nRow 5: #      #\nRow 6: #  A A #\nRow 7: ########\n\nThat's correct. Now, this movement is safe. No collision. So choosing LEFT is a good direction to head towards the nearest apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP: head to (1,3). Then next possible directions (since direction is UP). The snake could turn LEFT to go towards (1,2), (1,1). Let's see: moving UP now (epoch 4) to (1,3). Then direction is UP. Next move (epoch 5) could be LEFT (allowed, since direction is UP, can turn left). Then head to (1,2). Then (epoch 6) LEFT again to (1,1), which is the apple. That's 3 moves (epoch 4: UP, epoch 5: LEFT, epoch 6: LEFT). So that's also a path to the apple. Which is faster? Let's count steps:\n\nOption 1: Current direction UP. Move UP (epoch 4) → (1,3). Then epoch 5: LEFT → (1,2). Epoch 6: LEFT → (1,1). That's 3 steps (epoch 4,5,6) to reach the apple.\n\nOption 2: Current direction UP. Move LEFT (epoch 4) → (2,2). Epoch 5: LEFT → (2,1). Epoch 6: UP → (1,1). That's 3 steps as well.\n\nSo both paths take 3 steps. Which is better? Let's check if any of these paths have obstacles. For option 1, moving UP to (1,3) (row 1, column 3). Then moving LEFT to (1,2), then (1,1). All those positions are empty. So safe.\n\nFor option 2, moving LEFT to (2,2), then LEFT to (2,1), then UP to (1,1). Also safe.\n\nBut what about the snake's body? Let's see:\n\nIf we move UP (epoch 4), new head (1,3). The body is (2,3) (old head). So row 2: (2,3) is S. Then, in epoch 5, moving LEFT to (1,2). The body would be (1,3) (old head). So row 1: (1,3) is S. Then epoch 6, moving LEFT to (1,1). The body is (1,2) (old head). So that's safe.\n\nIf we move LEFT (epoch 4), new head (2,2). Body (2,3). Then epoch 5, moving LEFT to (2,1). Body (2,2). Then epoch 6, moving UP to (1,1). Body (2,1). All safe.\n\nSo both paths are possible. But which direction is better? Let's see if there's any immediate danger. The snake's current body is (3,3). If we move UP, the new body is (2,3). If we then move LEFT, the new head is (1,2), and the body is (1,3). No collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT, new body is (2,3). Then moving LEFT again, new head (2,1), body (2,2). Then moving UP, head (1,1), body (2,1). All safe.\n\nSo either direction (UP or LEFT) could work. But let's check the current direction. The current direction is UP. If we choose to continue moving UP, the next position is (1,3), which is safe. Then, as mentioned, we can turn left towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose LEFT now, the direction changes to LEFT, which allows us to move towards (2,1) next.\n\nBut perhaps the apple at (1,1) is in row 1, which is closer to the top. So moving UP first gets us to row 1, which is where the apple is. Let's compare:\n\nIf we move UP now (epoch 4), head at (1,3). Then, the next move (epoch 5) can be LEFT, which would take us to (1,2). Then (epoch 6) LEFT to (1,1), which is the apple. So that's 3 epochs (4,5,6) to reach the apple. That's better than waiting.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now (epoch 4), head at (2,2). Then epoch 5, move LEFT to (2,1). Epoch 6, move UP to (1,1). Also 3 epochs.\n\nSo both paths are 3 steps. But which is more straightforward? Let's think about possible collisions. For example, if the snake moves UP, then (1,3) is safe. Then moving LEFT is allowed. If the snake moves LEFT, (2,2) is safe.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's length is 2. So the body is only one segment. So there's no risk of self-collision as long as the head doesn't move into the body. Let's check if any direction leads to collision with the body.\n\nCurrent body is at (3,3). So possible new head positions:\n\n- UP: (1,3) → not (3,3), safe.\n\n- LEFT: (2,2) → not (3,3), safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (2,4) → not (3,3), safe.\n\nSo all directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the most apples? Let's see. The apples are at (1,1), (6,2), (6,4). So (1,1) is the closest. So the best strategy is to head towards (1,1).\n\nBetween moving UP then LEFT, or LEFT then UP, which is better? Let's think about the next moves.\n\nIf we move UP now (epoch 4), head at (1,3). Then, in epoch 5, we can move LEFT to (1,2). Then epoch 6, move LEFT to (1,1), which is the apple. That's three moves, and we eat the apple. That's good.\n\nIf we move LEFT now (epoch 4), head at (2,2). Epoch 5: move LEFT to (2,1). Epoch 6: move UP to (1,1). Also three moves. So either direction is okay.\n\nBut since the current direction is UP, moving UP is continuing in the current direction, which may be better (since changing direction might not be necessary if the path is clear). However, the apple is to the left and up. So moving UP first gets us to row 1, which is the row of the apple, then moving left. That might be more direct.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT first gets us to column 2, then moving up. Either way.\n\nBut perhaps the best choice is to move LEFT, because if we move UP, the next position is (1,3), which is in row 1, but then moving left towards (1,1) would require two left moves, and the snake's body would be in (2,3), which is in row 2. That's safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the board again. The current head is at (2,3). The body is at (3,3). So the snake is moving up, so the body is behind (south of the head). So the snake is facing north.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is northwest of the head. So to reach it, the snake needs to move north and west. So the optimal path would be to move west (left) then north, or north then west. Either is possible.\n\nIn terms of game rules, the direction can be any of UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since can't reverse to DOWN). So all are allowed.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving, is there any chance of hitting the wall soon? For example, if we move UP, the next position is (1,3). Then, if we move UP again, the next position would be (0,3), which is a wall (row 0 is all #). So moving UP again would end the game. So we must not move UP again after that. So after moving UP to (1,3), the next direction must not be UP. So the next move should be LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nBut if we move LEFT to (1,2), then we're safe. So that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if we move LEFT to (2,2), then next move can be UP, LEFT, or DOWN. Moving UP from (2,2) would take us to (1,2), which is safe, then LEFT to (1,1).\n\nSo both paths are safe.\n\nIn this case, perhaps moving LEFT is better because it starts moving towards the apple's column (column 1) earlier. But it's a bit of a toss-up. However, given that the snake is currently moving UP, and the apple is to the left and up, moving LEFT now would allow the snake to start moving towards the apple's column, then up. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best answer here is to move LEFT. Let's go with LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#   H  #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head is at (row 2, column 3), body at (row 3, column 3), and it is moving UP. The apples are at (1,1), (6,2), and (6,4). The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid), leaving UP, LEFT, or RIGHT as options.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: The head moves to (1,3). This position is empty (no apple), and the body shifts to (2,3) (previous head). The next move could then be LEFT to approach the apple at (1,1), but moving UP again would hit the top wall (row 0), so caution is needed.  \n2. **LEFT**: The head moves to (2,2). This position is empty, and the body shifts to (2,3) (previous head). From (2,2), subsequent LEFT moves (to (2,1)) and then UP (to (1,1)) would reach the nearest apple (1,1) in 3 steps, which is efficient.  \n3. **RIGHT**: The head moves to (2,4). This position is empty, but the nearest apples (6,2 and 6,4) are farther away, requiring more steps to reach compared to (1,1).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is optimal as it directs the snake toward the closest apple (1,1) in the fewest steps while avoiding immediate collisions. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, let's look at the current game board and the current direction.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#  HS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\nCurrent direction is LEFT, and the current epoch is 5. The snake can't reverse direction, so since it's moving LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (continuing the same direction).\n\nFirst, let's find the snake's head position. The head is 'H'. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 1 (second line) is #A     #. Row 2 (third line) is #  HS  #. So row 2 has \"  HS  \" which is positions 2 (index 2) as ' ', 3 as 'H', 4 as 'S', then 5 as ' '. So the head 'H' is at (row 2, column 3) if we count rows starting from 0. Let's confirm:\n\nRow indices (assuming top is 0):\nRow 0: ######## (all #)\nRow 1: #A     # → positions 1 is A, others are spaces except first and last #\nRow 2: #  HS  # → columns 1 is #, 2 is ' ', 3 is 'H', 4 is 'S', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is #. So H is at (row 2, column 3).\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. So the snake is moving left, which would take the head to (row 2, column 2) in the next move. Let's check what's there. The current cell to the left of H (column 3-1=2) in row 2 is ' ' (space). So if we move LEFT, the new head position is (2,2). Then, the body: the snake's body is 'S' at (2,4). Since the snake is length 2 (H and S), when moving, the tail (the S) would stay if the snake doesn't eat an apple. Wait, no: when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body part follows the previous position. But if the snake eats an apple, it grows, so the tail doesn't move. Otherwise, the tail is removed.\n\nWait, in the example given, when the snake moves down and eats an apple, the new board shows the head moving there and the body parts increasing. Let's recap the example:\n\nOriginal example board:\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nDirection given is DOWN. So the head (H) was at row 3 (assuming 0-based) column 1. Moving down to row 4, column 1. The cell there was 'A' (since row 4 is #AA    # → column 1 is A). So the snake eats the apple, grows. The new head is at (4,1), and the body parts follow. The original body was S at row 2, column 1. After moving down, the head moves to (4,1), the previous head (3,1) becomes S, and the original S (2,1) remains. So the new board has S at row 3,1 and row 2,1, and H at row 4,1. So the body length increased by 1.\n\nSo, in general, when moving, the head moves to new position. If that position is an apple, the snake grows (so the tail doesn't move; the body increases by 1). If not, the tail is removed (so the body length stays the same; each body part moves to the position of the previous part, and the tail's last position is cleared).\n\nNow, back to current problem. Current snake has H at (2,3), S at (2,4). So the snake's body is H (head) followed by S (body) in that order. So the direction of movement is LEFT. So the next head position would be (2,3-1) = (2,2). Let's check that cell. The current cell (2,2) is ' ' (space). So moving LEFT here would not eat an apple. Then, the body would move: the S at (2,4) would move to (2,3) (the previous head position), and the new head is (2,2). So the snake would be H at (2,2), S at (2,3), and the old S at (2,4) would be removed (since no apple was eaten). So the snake's length remains 2.\n\nBut maybe moving in another direction could get an apple. Let's check possible directions. The current direction is LEFT, so cannot reverse to RIGHT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT: next head position (2,2). What's there? The cell (2,2) is ' ' (from the current board: row 2 is #  HS  # → columns 1 is #, 2 is ' ', 3 is H, 4 is S, 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is #. So (2,2) is ' '.\n\nSo moving LEFT, no apple. The snake moves, body follows. New positions would be H at (2,2), S at (2,3). The old S at (2,4) is now empty. So that's safe.\n\n2. UP: current head is at (2,3). Moving UP would take it to (1,3). Let's check row 1: #A     #. So row 1, column 3 is ' ' (since row 1 is columns 0: #, 1: A, 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (1,3) is ' '.\n\nSo moving UP, head to (1,3). Then, check if that's a wall or body. (1,3) is within the board (since rows are 0-7, columns 0-7; row 1 is valid, column 3 is valid). The walls are only the first and last rows and columns (0 and 7 for rows, 0 and 7 for columns). So (1,3) is safe. Then, since it's a space, the body would move: the S at (2,4) moves to (2,3) (old head position), and the new head is (1,3). So snake would be H at (1,3), S at (2,3). The old S at (2,4) is cleared. Safe.\n\n3. DOWN: current head is (2,3). Moving DOWN would take it to (3,3). Let's check row 3: #      #. So (3,3) is ' ' (row 3 is all spaces except first and last #). So (3,3) is safe. Then, moving down, head to (3,3). The body S at (2,4) moves to (2,3), new body part. So snake would be H at (3,3), S at (2,3). Old S at (2,4) cleared. Safe.\n\nNow, let's check if any of these directions lead to apples. Let's look for apples on the board. The apples are 'A's. Let's list their positions.\n\nRow 1 (second line): #A     # → column 1 is A. So (1,1) is A.\n\nRow 6 (seventh line): #  A A # → columns 3 and 5 are A. Let's see: row 6 (0-based row 6) is \"#  A A #\". So columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: A, 4: ' ', 5: A, 6: ' ', 7: #. So (6,3) and (6,5) are apples.\n\nSo current apples are at (1,1), (6,3), (6,5).\n\nNow, the snake's current head is (2,3). Let's see which direction can reach an apple next.\n\nIf we move LEFT: next head (2,2). Not an apple.\n\nIf we move UP: next head (1,3). Let's check (1,3): row 1, column 3. The row 1 is #A     #. Column 1 is A, others in the row are spaces. So (1,3) is ' ', no apple.\n\nIf we move DOWN: next head (3,3). (3,3) is ' ', no apple.\n\nSo none of the next moves in the possible directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT) would reach an apple. So the snake can't eat an apple in the next move. So the priority is to avoid collision and maybe set up for future apples.\n\nBut let's check if any direction would lead to a collision in the next step.\n\nMoving LEFT: (2,2) is ' ', safe. No collision with body (current body is at (2,4); the new head is (2,2), which is not overlapping with S at (2,4) or (2,3) (after movement). Because after moving LEFT, the body S would be at (2,3), so the new positions would be H at (2,2), S at (2,3). No collision.\n\nMoving UP: (1,3) is ' ', safe. Body moves to (2,3). So new positions H (1,3), S (2,3). No collision.\n\nMoving DOWN: (3,3) is ' ', safe. Body moves to (2,3). New positions H (3,3), S (2,3). No collision.\n\nSo all three directions are safe. Now, which direction is better for future moves? Let's think about the snake's position and the apples.\n\nThe apples are at (1,1), (6,3), (6,5). Let's see the distances.\n\nCurrent head is (2,3).\n\nApple at (1,1): distance (row difference 1, column difference 2). To reach it, the snake would need to move up and left.\n\nApple at (6,3): row difference 4 (down), column 0 (same). So 4 steps down.\n\nApple at (6,5): row difference 4 (down), column 2 (right). So 4 down, 2 right.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT now (current direction), next head is (2,2). Then, possible directions would be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again (since can't reverse to RIGHT). From (2,2), moving LEFT again would go to (2,1). Let's check (2,1) in row 2: #  HS  #. So row 2, column 1 is ' ' (since row 2 is \"#  HS  #\", columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: H, 4: S, 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #). So (2,1) is ' ', safe. Then, moving LEFT again to (2,1). Then, perhaps moving up towards (1,1) (the apple at (1,1) is at row 1, column 1). So (2,1) is column 1, row 2. If the snake is at (2,1), moving up would take it to (1,1), which is the apple. That's a good path. So moving LEFT now could lead to reaching the apple at (1,1) in two steps (current move LEFT to (2,2), next move LEFT to (2,1), then move UP to (1,1)).\n\nIf the snake moves UP now, head to (1,3). Then, possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT (but can't reverse from UP, so possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, UP). From (1,3), moving LEFT would take to (1,2), then (1,1) (apple). That's two steps (UP to (1,3), LEFT to (1,2), LEFT to (1,1)). So same number of steps as the LEFT path.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN now, head to (3,3). Then, possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. From (3,3), moving down towards (6,3) (apple at (6,3)) would take 3 steps (3→4→5→6 rows). So that's longer.\n\nSo moving LEFT or UP could get to an apple in a few steps. Let's see which is better. Let's check if moving LEFT now would block the snake.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (2,2), next direction could be LEFT again (to (2,1)), then UP to (1,1) (apple). That's a clear path.\n\nIf we move UP to (1,3), next direction could be LEFT (to (1,2)), then LEFT again (to (1,1)), which is the apple. That's also clear.\n\nBut let's check if there are any body parts in the way. The current body is at (2,4). After moving LEFT, the body moves to (2,3). So the new body is (2,3). If we move LEFT again, the head would be (2,1), and the body would be (2,2). Then moving UP to (1,1) would be safe.\n\nIf we move UP, the body moves to (2,3). Then moving LEFT to (1,2), body moves to (1,3). Then moving LEFT to (1,1), which is the apple. That's safe.\n\nSo both paths are possible. But which is better? Let's see the current direction is LEFT, so continuing in that direction may be more straightforward. Also, the apple at (1,1) is in the upper left, and moving LEFT would approach it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP could also work, but perhaps the LEFT direction is better as it's the current direction and doesn't require changing direction yet. Since all options are safe, perhaps the best choice is to continue moving LEFT, as reversing direction is not allowed but continuing is possible. But the question is, which direction should be chosen to maximize the chance of eating apples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better option. Let's check again the positions.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's body. The current body is at (2,4). If the snake moves LEFT, the body moves to (2,3). Then, if the snake moves UP from (2,2) (next position after LEFT), it would go to (1,2), which is safe. The body would then be at (2,2). No collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP first: the snake's head is at (1,3), body at (2,3). Then moving LEFT to (1,2), body at (1,3). Then moving LEFT to (1,1) (apple). That's safe.\n\nSo both paths are possible. But since the current direction is LEFT, and the snake can continue moving LEFT, which is allowed, perhaps that's the best choice. Because changing direction might not be necessary if the current path is leading towards an apple.\n\nSo the answer would be LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#  HS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is located at row 2, column 3 (0-indexed). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **LEFT**: The head moves to (2, 2) (row 2, column 2), which is empty. The body ('S' at (2, 4)) shifts to the previous head position (2, 3). No collision occurs, and no apple is eaten. This keeps the snake moving toward the apple at (1, 1) (row 1, column 1) in future steps.  \n2. **UP**: The head moves to (1, 3) (row 1, column 3), which is empty. The body shifts to (2, 3). No collision occurs, but this moves the snake away from the nearest apple at (1, 1).  \n3. **DOWN**: The head moves to (3, 3) (row 3, column 3), which is empty. The body shifts to (2, 3). No collision occurs, but this moves the snake toward apples at (6, 3) and (6, 5) (row 6), which are farther away.  \n\n### Best Choice:\nContinuing in the current direction (LEFT) keeps the snake on a path toward the nearest apple at (1, 1) without risk of collision. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' walls. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A     # (so position (1,1) is 'A', others in the row are spaces except the walls)\nRow 2: # HS   #. Let's see, the positions here. The first character is '#', then at (2,1) is ' ', (2,2) is 'H' (head), (2,3) is 'S' (body), and the rest are spaces until the closing '#'. So the head is at (2,2), body at (2,3).\nRow 3: #      # (all spaces except walls)\nRow 4: #      # (same)\nRow 5: #      # (same)\nRow 6: #  A A #. So positions (6,2) and (6,4) are 'A's.\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. Let's confirm the head's position. The head is at (2,2). Moving left would take it to (2,1) (since left decreases the column index). Let's check what's in (2,1). Looking at row 2: \"# HS   #\", so (2,1) is a space (since the characters are [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] 'H', [3] 'S', etc. So (row, column) is (2,2) for H. So moving left (current direction) would take H to (2,1). What's in (2,1)? Let's check row 2 again. The row is \"# HS   #\", which is 8 characters. Let's index each position (columns 0 to 7, since rows are 0-7). Column 0 is '#', column 1 is ' ', column 2 is 'H', column 3 is 'S', columns 4-6 are ' ', column 7 is '#'. So yes, (2,1) is a space.\n\nBut the player can choose a new direction, but can't reverse. Current direction is LEFT. The possible directions are LEFT (current, allowed), UP, DOWN (since reversing would be RIGHT, which is opposite of LEFT, so RIGHT is not allowed). So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nWe need to choose a direction that avoids collision (walls or self) and ideally gets an apple. Let's think about the next move.\n\nFirst, the current snake's body: the head is at (2,2), body at (2,3). So the snake's length is 2. When it moves, the head moves to the new position, and if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (the last body part) moves forward. If it eats an apple, the body grows (so the tail doesn't move, adding a new body part).\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Continue moving LEFT (current direction). Next head position is (2,1). Let's check if that's a wall or body. (2,1) is a space (from row 2: \"# HS   #\", so column 1 is ' '). So safe. Then, after moving, the body would shift. The new head is (2,1), the old head (2,2) becomes body, and the old body (2,3) would be removed unless an apple is eaten. But in (2,1), is there an apple? Let's check. Row 1 is \"#A     #\". (1,1) is 'A', but (2,1) is in row 2, column 1, which is ' ' (from row 2). So no apple here. So the snake moves left, head to (2,1), body becomes (2,2), and the tail (2,3) is removed. So the new body would be (2,2) as S. That's safe.\n\n2. Direction UP: Moving up from head (2,2) would take it to (1,2). Let's check (1,2). Row 1 is \"#A     #\". Columns 0 is '#', 1 is 'A', 2 is ' ', 3-6 are ' ', 7 is '#'. So (1,2) is a space. So that's safe. Now, check if there's an apple there. (1,2) is ' ', so no. So moving up, head is (1,2), old head (2,2) becomes body, old body (2,3) is removed. Safe.\n\n3. Direction DOWN: Moving down from (2,2) to (3,2). Check (3,2). Row 3 is \"#      #\", so column 2 is ' ', safe. No apple there. So moving down, head (3,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3) removed. Safe.\n\nNow, let's see where the apples are. The apples are at:\n\n- Row 1, column 1 (1,1): 'A' (from row 1: \"#A     #\")\n- Row 6, column 2 (6,2): 'A' (row 6: \"#  A A #\", column 2 is 'A')\n- Row 6, column 4 (6,4): 'A' (row 6, column 4 is 'A')\n\nThe snake's goal is to eat apples. So we need to plan a path to reach these apples. Let's see the current positions.\n\nCurrent head is (2,2). Let's see distances to apples:\n\n- Apple at (1,1): distance. To get there, the snake would need to move left (to (2,1)), then up (to (1,1)). If current direction is LEFT, next move could be left to (2,1). Then, next direction could be up (since after moving left, the current direction would be LEFT, so next possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. So from (2,1), moving up to (1,1) (which is the apple) would be good. So if we choose LEFT now, then next move up would reach the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose UP now: moving to (1,2). Then, the next direction could be left (since current direction would be UP, so can't reverse to DOWN. Possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT). So from (1,2), moving left to (1,1) (the apple) would be possible. That's another path.\n\nThe apple at (6,2) is in row 6, column 2. The head is at (2,2). So that's 4 rows down (from row 2 to row 6). So moving down each time. But that's a longer path. Similarly, apple at (6,4) is column 4, which is two to the right from (2,2) (current column 2).\n\nSo the closest apples are (1,1) and (6,2), (6,4). Let's prioritize the closest. The apple at (1,1) is (row 1, column 1). Current head (2,2) is one row down and one column right from (1,1). So to reach (1,1), the snake can move left (to (2,1)) then up (to (1,1)), which would be two moves. Alternatively, move up (to (1,2)) then left (to (1,1)), also two moves.\n\nIf we choose to move LEFT now (current direction is LEFT, allowed), then the head moves to (2,1). Then next move (epoch 7) could be UP (since direction after LEFT can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again). So in epoch 7, direction UP would take head from (2,1) to (1,1), which is the apple. Then the snake would eat it, grow, and score increases. That's a good plan.\n\nIf we choose UP now, head moves to (1,2). Then next direction could be LEFT (since direction is UP, next directions can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT). So moving LEFT from (1,2) to (1,1) (apple) in epoch 7. That's also a good plan.\n\nWhich is better? Let's check if moving LEFT now is possible without collision. Current direction is LEFT. The next position (2,1) is safe (no wall, no body). So moving LEFT is safe. Then, moving UP next step would reach the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP now: (1,2) is safe. Then LEFT to (1,1) (apple).\n\nBut what about the body? Let's think about the snake's body after moving. The current body is (2,3). When the snake moves, the body follows. So if the snake moves LEFT (head to (2,1)), the new body would be (2,2) (old head), and the old body (2,3) is removed (since no apple was eaten). So the snake's body after moving LEFT would be (2,2). So in the next step, if we move UP to (1,1), the body would be (2,1) (old head), and (2,2) (old body) would remain if we eat the apple. Wait, no: when the snake eats an apple, the body grows, so the tail doesn't get removed. Let's clarify: when the snake moves into a square with an apple, it eats it. The head moves to the new position, and the body increases by 1 (so all previous body parts remain, and the new head is added). So, for example, if the snake is length 2 (H at (2,2), S at (2,3)), and moves into an apple, the new head is at the apple's position, the old H becomes S, and the old S remains (so length 3).\n\nSo, let's consider if moving LEFT now (epoch 6) to (2,1), which is a space (no apple). Then, the body becomes (2,2) (old H) and the old body (2,3) is removed (since no apple eaten). So the snake's body is now (2,2) (length 2 again). Then, in epoch 7, if direction is UP, moving to (1,1) (which is the apple). Then, the head is at (1,1), the old head (2,1) becomes S, and the old body (2,2) becomes S as well (since we ate the apple, so the body grows by 1). So the snake's length becomes 3. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if we move UP now (epoch 6) to (1,2), which is a space. The body becomes (2,2) (old H), and the old body (2,3) is removed (length 2). Then, in epoch 7, direction LEFT to (1,1) (apple). Then, head at (1,1), old head (1,2) becomes S, old body (2,2) becomes S (length 3). Also good.\n\nSo both paths are possible. But let's check if there are any possible collisions in the next steps. Let's see if moving in any direction now would lead to a collision in the next steps.\n\nAnother thing: the snake can't reverse direction. So if current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nNow, what's the current position of the snake's body? The body is at (2,3). So when moving, the next positions must not collide with the body. Let's check for each direction:\n\nIf we move LEFT: new head (2,1). The body after moving would be (2,2) (old head), and the old body (2,3) is removed. So the new body is (2,2). So no collision here.\n\nIf we move UP: new head (1,2). The body becomes (2,2) (old head), old body (2,3) removed. So new body is (2,2). No collision.\n\nIf we move DOWN: new head (3,2). The body becomes (2,2), old body (2,3) removed. No collision.\n\nSo all three directions are safe. Now, which direction leads to the apple the fastest.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is the closest. Let's see which direction gets us there in the next step.\n\nIf we choose LEFT now (epoch 6), head moves to (2,1). Then, in epoch 7, direction UP would take head to (1,1) (apple). That's one step away.\n\nIf we choose UP now (epoch 6), head moves to (1,2). Then, in epoch 7, direction LEFT would take head to (1,1) (apple). Also one step away.\n\nIf we choose DOWN now, then head moves to (3,2). That's moving away from the apple (1,1). So that's not optimal.\n\nSo between LEFT and UP. Which is better? Let's see if there's any obstacle. For example, after moving LEFT to (2,1), the next move UP to (1,1) is possible. Let's check (1,1): that's the apple. So yes.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (1,2), then LEFT to (1,1) (apple). That's also possible.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer one over the other? Let's think about the snake's body after moving. Let's say we choose LEFT now. The new body is (2,2). Then, when moving UP to (1,1), the body would be (2,1) (old head) and (2,2) (old body). So the snake would be at (1,1) (H), (2,1) (S), (2,2) (S). That's a vertical line down from the head, which is okay.\n\nIf we choose UP now, new body is (2,2). Then moving LEFT to (1,1), the body would be (1,2) (old head) and (2,2) (old body). So the snake is (1,1) (H), (1,2) (S), (2,2) (S). That's a horizontal line to the right of the head, also okay.\n\nEither direction is safe. But perhaps moving in the current direction (LEFT) is better, since changing direction might not be necessary. But the problem is to choose the best direction to eat apples. Both directions are valid. However, perhaps the apple at (1,1) is in row 1, column 1, which is adjacent to the top wall. So moving up might be okay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snake's current direction is LEFT. If we continue moving LEFT, the next position is (2,1). Let's check if (2,1) is a valid position. Yes, it's a space. Then, the next direction could be UP to reach (1,1), which is the apple. So that's a good path.\n\nSo I think the best direction here is LEFT. Wait, but wait: when the snake is moving LEFT, the head is at (2,2). Moving LEFT would take it to (2,1). Let's confirm the coordinates. Rows are 0-7, columns 0-7. So row 2, column 2 is H. Moving LEFT (column decreases by 1) would be (2,1). Correct. And (2,1) is a space. So that's safe. Then, next move up would get the apple. So choosing LEFT now is a good move.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n# HS   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,2) (row 2, column 2), with a body segment at (2,3). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. Possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nKey observations:\n1. **Apples are at (1,1), (6,2), and (6,4)**. The closest apple is (1,1), which is one move left (to (2,1)) and then up (to (1,1)) from the head.\n2. **Moving LEFT (current direction)** is safe: the next head position (2,1) is a space (no wall or self-collision). This positions the snake to reach the apple (1,1) in the next move by turning UP.\n3. **Moving UP or DOWN** would also be safe but would not directly position the snake closer to the nearest apple (1,1) as effectively as continuing LEFT.\n\nChoosing LEFT allows the snake to approach the nearest apple efficiently while avoiding collisions. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by repeating the game board as per the user's request.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#HS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. Let's map out the positions. The board is 8x8, with the first and last rows being all '#'. Let's index rows from top to bottom (row 0 to 7) and columns from left (0) to right (7).\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7)\nRow 1: #A     # → columns 0 is '#', column 1 is 'A', columns 2-6 are spaces, column 7 is '#'\nRow 2: #HS    # → column 0 is '#', column 1 is 'H', column 2 is 'S', columns 3-6 are spaces, column 7 is '#'\nRow 3: #      # → all spaces except first and last columns\nRow 4: #      # → same\nRow 5: #      # → same\nRow 6: #  A A # → column 0 is '#', columns 2 and 4 are 'A's, others (1,3,5,6) are spaces, column 7 is '#'\nRow 7: ######## \n\nSo the head 'H' is at row 2, column 1. The body 'S' is at row 2, column 2. The snake's current direction is LEFT. Since the direction is LEFT, the next move (if we don't change direction) would be to move the head to the left. Let's check where that would be. Moving LEFT from (2,1) would take the head to (2,0), which is a wall ('#'). That's a collision, so the game would end. So we can't keep moving LEFT.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is LEFT, so reversing would be RIGHT. But can't reverse, so we can't choose RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or keep LEFT (but that's a wall). Wait, the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, but can't reverse. The current direction is LEFT, so reversing would be RIGHT. So the allowed directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since LEFT is current direction, not reversed). Wait, the rule says \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So if current direction is LEFT, then the opposite is RIGHT. So you can't turn to RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. But moving LEFT now would hit the wall (column 0), which is a loss. So we must change direction to UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check possible moves. Let's see where the head is now: (2,1). Let's check possible next positions for each direction.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, so if we choose UP:\n\nMoving UP from (2,1) → row 1, column 1. What's there? Looking at row 1, column 1 is 'A' (from row 1: #A     #). So if we move UP, the head would go to (1,1), which is an apple. Then the snake would eat the apple, grow in length. The new head is at (1,1), and the body would follow. The previous head (2,1) becomes part of the body, and the previous body (2,2) would stay as part of the body. So the new snake would have head at (1,1), then body at (2,1), then (2,2). That's a good move because it eats an apple, increases the score, and avoids collision.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: Moving DOWN from (2,1) → row 3, column 1. That's a space. So the head moves to (3,1), and the body shifts: previous head (2,1) becomes body, previous body (2,2) stays. So the snake's new positions are (3,1) as head, (2,1) and (2,2) as body. That's safe, but no apple eaten.\n\nIf we choose LEFT: Moving to (2,0), which is a wall. Game over. So that's bad.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: That's reversing direction (current is LEFT, right is opposite), which is not allowed. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo the options are UP (good, apple) or DOWN (safe, no apple). Since the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, choosing UP would be better. Let's confirm.\n\nRow 1, column 1 is 'A'. So moving UP there would eat the apple, which is good. The next position would be safe (since it's within the board, and the snake's body is at (2,1) and (2,2), so the new head (1,1) isn't colliding with the body. So that's a valid move. So the best direction is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#HS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at (row 2, column 1), with a body segment 'S' at (row 2, column 2). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. \n\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 2, column 0), which is a wall (collision, game over).  \n- Moving RIGHT is invalid (reverse direction).  \n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 3, column 1), a safe empty space but no apple.  \n- Moving UP would take the head to (row 1, column 1), which contains an apple 'A'. Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake without collision.  \n\nThus, the optimal move is UP. \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' walls. Let's list out each row to visualize it better:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #H     # (so the head 'H' is at position (1,1) assuming rows are 0-indexed from top, columns 0-indexed from left)\nRow 2: #SS    # (the body 'S' is at (2,1) and (2,2))\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #      # (empty)\nRow 5: #     A# (apple at (5,5))\nRow 6: #  A A # (apples at (6,2) and (6,4))\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. Since the current direction is UP, the snake can't reverse to DOWN immediately. So possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP. But wait, the snake's movement direction is controlled by the input, but it can't reverse. So if current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's think about where the snake's head will move next. The head is at (1,1). If the direction remains UP, the next position would be (0,1), which is a wall (since row 0 is all '#'). That would cause a collision, ending the game. So moving UP is bad because it hits the top wall.\n\nSo UP is invalid. So we can't choose UP. So the options are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check LEFT. If direction is LEFT, the head would move from (1,1) to (1,0). (1,0) is the first column of row 1. Looking at row 1: \"#H     #\", which is columns 0 to 7. Column 0 is '#', so (1,0) is a wall. So moving LEFT would hit the wall. That's a collision. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo the only remaining option is RIGHT. Let's check RIGHT. The head is at (1,1). Moving RIGHT would take it to (1,2). What's in (1,2)? The row 1 is \"#H     #\", so after H (column 1), column 2 is empty (since it's a space). So (1,2) is a safe position. Now, we need to check if that square is part of the snake's body. The body is in row 2: (2,1) and (2,2). So (1,2) is not part of the body. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT, the snake's head is at (1,2). The body segments will follow. Since the snake's current length is 3 (head H at (1,1), body S at (2,1) and (2,2)), when it moves, the new head is (1,2), and the body becomes (1,1) and (2,1), because the tail (the last S) would move up. Wait, how does the snake's body move? In snake games, when the snake moves, each body segment follows the one in front. So the head moves to new position, then each body part moves to the position of the previous part.\n\nCurrent snake positions (before moving):\nHead: (1,1)\nBody: (2,1), (2,2) (since row 2 is #SS    #, which is columns 1 and 2 are S)\nSo the order is head at (1,1), then body segments (2,1) (next), then (2,2) (the tail).\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, the new head is (1,2). Then the body segments follow: the first body (2,1) moves to (1,1), and the tail (2,2) moves to (2,1). So the new body positions would be (1,1) and (2,1). So the new board after moving RIGHT would have H at (1,2), S at (1,1) and (2,1). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 1 after moving: # S H   # (columns 0: #, 1: S, 2: H, others space)\nRow 2 after moving: # S    # (column 1: S, others space)\nOther rows remain the same except the snake's positions. That's safe.\n\nNow, are there any apples in the new head position (1,2)? The original board's row 1 has \"#H     #\", so (1,2) is a space. No apple there. So the snake doesn't eat an apple, but it's safe.\n\nSo the possible directions are only RIGHT, because UP and LEFT lead to walls, and DOWN is a reverse direction (current direction is UP, can't go DOWN). So the answer must be RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#H     #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so cannot choose DOWN). Let's analyze possible moves:\n\n- **UP**: The head is at (1,1) (row 1, column 1). Moving UP would take it to (0,1), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). Collision with wall: invalid.\n- **LEFT**: The head at (1,1) moving LEFT would go to (1,0), which is a wall (column 0 of row 1 is '#'). Collision with wall: invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: The head at (1,1) moving RIGHT goes to (1,2). This position is empty (no wall or snake body). The snake's body is at (2,1) and (2,2), so (1,2) is safe. No collision occurs.\n\nThus, the only valid direction is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#SH    #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT, and the current epoch is 9. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. Let's map out the positions.\n\nThe board is 8x8. Let's index rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7), and columns from left (column 0) to right (column 7).\n\nRow 0: ######## (all #, walls)\nRow 1: #SH    # → columns 1: #, 2: S, 3: H, 4-6: spaces, 7: #\nRow 2: #S     # → column 1: #, 2: S, 3-6: spaces, 7: #\nRow 3: #      # → column 1: #, 2-6: spaces, 7: #\nRow 4: #      # → same as row 3\nRow 5: #     A# → column 1: #, 2-5: spaces, 6: A, 7: #\nRow 6: #  A A # → column 1: #, 2: space, 3: A, 4: space, 5: A, 6: space, 7: #\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at row 1, column 3 (row 1, column 3). The body (S) is at row 1, column 2 and row 2, column 2. Because the snake moves in the current direction (RIGHT), let's check where the head would move next if we don't change direction.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction, so from RIGHT, the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since reversing would be LEFT, which is not allowed). Wait, the problem says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, wait. Let me check the exact rule. Oh, the example says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, no. The example says: \"cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT'\". Wait, that's the reverse. So if current direction is UP, the snake can't turn to DOWN (reverse). If current is LEFT, can't turn to RIGHT. Similarly, current direction is RIGHT, can't turn to LEFT. Current is DOWN, can't turn to UP. So possible directions from RIGHT are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse).\n\nSo the snake is moving RIGHT. Let's see the next position if direction is RIGHT: head is at (1,3). Moving RIGHT would take it to (1,4). Let's check if that's a wall or body. The cell (1,4) is a space (from row 1: #SH    # → positions 1: #, 2:S, 3:H, 4: space, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #). So (1,4) is safe. So if we go RIGHT, the head moves to (1,4), the body segments follow. The current body is (1,2) and (2,2). Since the snake's length is 3 (H is 1, S is 2, so total length 3). When moving, the head moves to new position, and each body part follows the previous one. So the previous head (1,3) becomes a body part (S), and the body parts (1,2) and (2,2) will shift: (1,2) would move to where the next part was. Wait, maybe I should model the snake's body as a list. Let's list the snake's positions in order. The head is the first element. The body follows. Since the snake moves in direction RIGHT, and the current head is (1,3), the body is (1,2) and (2,2). So the snake's positions are [ (1,3), (1,2), (2,2) ].\n\nWhen moving RIGHT, the new head is (1,4). The body then becomes [ (1,3), (1,2) ] (since the snake's length is 3, so after moving, the tail (2,2) is removed unless an apple is eaten). Wait, no. The snake's length increases when it eats an apple. Normally, when moving, the head moves forward, and each body segment moves into the position of the previous segment, and the tail is removed. Unless it eats an apple, in which case the tail is not removed, so the length increases by 1.\n\nSo current snake length is 3 (H + 2 S). Let's confirm. The board shows row 1: #SH    # → H is at (1,3), S at (1,2). Row 2: #S     # → S at (2,2). So that's three segments: H at (1,3), S at (1,2), S at (2,2). So length 3.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (1,4), which is empty (no apple), then the new snake positions would be: new head (1,4), followed by (1,3), (1,2). The tail (2,2) is removed. So the new body would be (1,3), (1,2). The (2,2) position becomes empty. So the board after moving RIGHT (without eating) would have:\n\nRow 1: # S H  ... (since H is now at (1,4), previous H (1,3) becomes S, (1,2) becomes S, and (2,2) is now empty).\n\nBut let's check if there's an apple in (1,4). The current row 1 is #SH    #. So (1,4) is a space, no apple. So no apple eaten. So that's safe.\n\nBut maybe there's a better direction. Let's check possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since current direction is RIGHT, can't go LEFT).\n\nOption 1: Continue RIGHT. Next position (1,4). Safe.\n\nOption 2: Turn UP. Current head is at (1,3). UP would take it to (0,3). But row 0 is all # (walls). So (0,3) is a wall. That's a collision. So UP is invalid. Can't choose UP.\n\nOption 3: Turn DOWN. Current head (1,3). DOWN direction would take it to (2,3). Let's check (2,3). Row 2 is #S     #. So (2,3) is a space (column 3 is empty). So (2,3) is safe. So moving DOWN would take head to (2,3).\n\nSo possible directions are RIGHT and DOWN. Let's check both.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: next head (1,4). Safe. The snake moves there, no apple, so the tail (2,2) is removed. The new body would be (1,3), (1,2). So the board would have row 1: # S S H (columns 2:S, 3:S, 4:H, 5: space, etc.), row 2: #     # (since (2,2) is now empty).\n\nIf we choose DOWN: head moves to (2,3). Let's check (2,3) in the current board. Row 2 is #S     # → (2,3) is space. So safe. The body would follow. The new positions would be head (2,3), followed by (1,3), (1,2). The tail (2,2) is removed (since no apple eaten). So (2,2) becomes empty. The board's row 2 would have # S  H ... (column 2:S, 3:H). \n\nNow, let's think about the apples. The apples are at (5,6), (6,3), (6,5). Let's list their positions:\n\n- (5,6) → row 5, column 6 (since row 5 is #     A# → column 6 is A)\n- (6,3) → row 6, column 3 (row 6: #  A A # → column 3 is A)\n- (6,5) → row 6, column 5 (row 6: #  A A # → column 5 is A)\n\nThe snake's goal is to eat apples. So we need to find a path to reach an apple. Let's see the current head position (1,3). The apples are in row 5 and 6, which are below. So moving down might be a better path towards the apples.\n\nIf we go DOWN, the head is at (2,3). Next move, possible directions (since current direction would be DOWN now). Then, from DOWN, can't go UP. So possible directions: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf the snake continues moving down, next steps would take it towards row 3, 4, 5, etc., getting closer to the apples.\n\nIf we go RIGHT now, the head moves to (1,4). Then, next direction could be RIGHT (to (1,5)), but that's moving away from the apples (which are in lower rows). So maybe moving down is better to approach the apples.\n\nAnother thing to check: Are there any body parts in the way. For example, if moving DOWN to (2,3), the current body is (1,2) and (2,2). (2,3) is not a body part, so safe.\n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN, which is better. Let's check if moving DOWN leads to an apple sooner. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head (1,3). If we go DOWN to (2,3), then next possible moves. Let's say we keep moving down: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). Oh! (6,3) is an apple (A). So if the snake moves down from (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) → (4,3) → (5,3) → (6,3), that's 5 moves (including the first DOWN move). At (6,3), it would eat the apple, increasing length.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake goes RIGHT now, (1,4). Then, maybe moving down from there. Let's see (1,4) → (2,4) → (3,4) → (4,4) → (5,4) → (6,4). (6,4) is a space (row 6: #  A A # → columns 3: A, 5:A. Column 4 is space). So that's not an apple. So (6,5) is an apple. So (6,5) is column 5. So (1,4) → down to (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) → then right to (6,5). That's longer.\n\nSo moving down now towards (6,3) (apple) seems better. So the best direction is DOWN. Let's confirm that moving DOWN is possible (no collision). (2,3) is a space, so safe. So the answer should be DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#SH    #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake’s head (H) is at (row 1, column 3). The body (S) occupies (row 1, column 2) and (row 2, column 2), making the snake length 3.\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Valid directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n- **Walls**: The top row (row 0) and bottom row (row 7) are walls. Moving UP from the head (row 1, column 3) would hit row 0 (a wall), so UP is invalid.\n- **Apples**: Apples are at (row 5, column 6), (row 6, column 3), and (row 6, column 5). These are in lower rows, so moving downward would better position the snake to reach them.\n\n### Valid Moves:\n1. **RIGHT**: The head would move to (row 1, column 4), which is empty. This is safe but moves the snake horizontally away from the apples in lower rows.\n2. **DOWN**: The head would move to (row 2, column 3), which is empty. This is safe and positions the snake to move toward the apples in rows 5–6.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving DOWN aligns the snake with the apple at (row 6, column 3), providing a direct path to eat an apple. Continuing RIGHT would move the snake away from the apples. Thus, DOWN is the best direction.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's situation.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). Let's parse the board row by row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SS    # → So, positions (1,1) and (1,2) are 'S' (snake body)\nRow 2: # H    # → Position (2,2) is 'H' (head)\nRow 3: #      # → Empty\nRow 4: #      # → Empty\nRow 5: #     A# → Position (5,6) is 'A' (apple)\nRow 6: #  A A # → Positions (6,3) and (6,5) are 'A's\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. The snake's head is at (2,2). Let's confirm the coordinates. Usually, in grids, rows are y and columns are x. So (row, column) where row 0 is top. So (2,2) is row 2, column 2.\n\nSince the current direction is DOWN, the next move without changing direction would be moving to row 3, column 2 (since down increases the row number). Let's check that position. Row 3 is \"#      #\", so (3,2) is empty (no wall, no snake body). So moving DOWN here would be safe.\n\nBut wait, the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is DOWN, so the opposite direction is UP. So the snake can turn LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN, but not UP.\n\nNow, let's check possible directions:\n\nPossible directions: DOWN (current), LEFT, RIGHT (since UP is opposite, can't turn to UP).\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. DOWN: Next position is (3,2). Check if that's a wall or snake body. (3,2) is empty. So safe. Then, after moving, the head moves to (3,2), and the body follows. Since the snake's length: the initial length is 1, but the current board shows 'SS' in row 1 (positions 1,1 and 1,2). So the snake's body is at (1,1) and (1,2), and the head at (2,2). So the snake's length is 3 (since H + two S's). When moving, the tail (the last S) would move only if the snake doesn't eat an apple. So if moving to (3,2) which is empty, the tail (position 1,1) would be removed, and the new body positions would be (1,2) → (2,2) (old head) → (3,2) (new head). So the new body would be (1,2), (2,2), (3,2).\n\nBut wait, when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward (the last segment is removed). If it does eat an apple, the tail stays, and the snake grows.\n\nIn this case, moving DOWN to (3,2) is empty, so no apple eaten. The tail (which is (1,1)) would be removed, so the new body would be (1,2) and (2,2), and the new head (3,2). So the snake's length remains 3.\n\n2. LEFT: Direction is LEFT. So the head would move from (2,2) to (2,1). Check that position. (2,1) is in row 2, column 1. The row 2 is \"# H    #\", so column 1 is a space (since the H is at column 2). So (2,1) is empty. Safe. Then, moving left. But need to check if that's a wall. Column 0 is a wall, but column 1 is within the board (columns 0-7, but the board's inner area is columns 1-6, since the first and last are walls). So (2,1) is safe. The body would follow: old head (2,2) becomes S, and the tail (1,1) is removed. So new body positions would be (1,2), (2,2), (2,1). But (2,1) is empty, so no apple. So no growth.\n\n3. RIGHT: Direction is RIGHT. Head moves from (2,2) to (2,3). Check (2,3): row 2 is \"# H    #\", so (2,3) is empty. Safe. Moving right. The new position (2,3) is empty, so tail (1,1) is removed. Body becomes (1,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nNow, the snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's check where the apples are. Apples are at (5,6), (6,3), (6,5).\n\nCurrent head is at (2,2). Let's see the path to the apples. The snake is moving down, so moving down would take it towards row 3, 4, 5, etc. Let's see:\n\nIf the snake continues moving down, next positions would be (3,2) → (4,2) → (5,2) → (6,2). Then, in row 6, column 3 is an apple. So from (6,2), moving right to (6,3) would reach the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake turns right, moving to (2,3), then maybe (3,3), (4,3) → (5,3), (6,3) (which is an apple). That's a direct path to the apple at (6,3). That's an apple in row 6, column 3.\n\nLet's check that. If the current direction is DOWN, and the snake turns RIGHT (allowed, since RIGHT is not opposite of DOWN), then the next head position is (2,3). Then, the next move direction could be RIGHT again, or continue in the new direction. But since the current epoch is 10, and the game ends at 100, there's time.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now (current direction) would take the head to (3,2). Then, if the snake continues down to (4,2), (5,2), (6,2). At (6,2), the next move could be right to (6,3) (apple). That's also a path.\n\nBut which direction gets to an apple faster?\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is in row 6, column 3. Let's compute the distance from the current head (2,2) to (6,3):\n\nCurrent head (2,2). If moving right to (2,3) (distance 1 step), then down each step: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). That's 4 steps (from (2,3) to (6,3) is 4 steps down). So total steps from now: 1 (right) + 4 (down) = 5 steps to reach that apple.\n\nIf moving down first: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then right to (6,3). That's 4 steps down, then 1 right. Total 5 steps as well. So same number of steps.\n\nBut are there any obstacles? The snake's body is at (1,1) and (1,2). So in row 1, columns 1 and 2. The current head is (2,2). So the body is above the head. So moving down, left, right, the snake's body is in row 1, which is above, so the snake's path down, right, or left (as long as not up) won't collide with the body.\n\nAnother apple is at (6,5). Let's see. From (2,2), moving right would take (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), etc. But that's possible, but (6,5) is further.\n\nThe third apple is at (5,6). That's row 5, column 6. So moving down to (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). That's 6 steps. Longer.\n\nSo the closest apples are (6,3) and (6,5) in row 6, and (5,6). The (6,3) is the closest.\n\nSo the snake should head towards (6,3). Let's see which direction (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) would lead towards that.\n\nIf the snake turns RIGHT now (current direction is DOWN, so turning RIGHT is allowed), then next position is (2,3). Then, the direction could be DOWN again (since after moving right, the direction is RIGHT, but the next move could be DOWN (since DOWN is not opposite of RIGHT). Wait, the direction is controlled by the player's input. Each move, the player gives a direction (which must not be opposite of current direction). So, the current direction is DOWN. The player can choose to input DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (since UP is opposite). If the player inputs RIGHT, then the new direction is RIGHT, and the snake moves RIGHT.\n\nSo, if the player chooses RIGHT now, the head moves to (2,3). Then, in the next step, the current direction would be RIGHT. Then, the player could choose to go DOWN (since DOWN is not opposite of RIGHT; opposite of RIGHT is LEFT). So moving down from (2,3) would be (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) (apple). That's a straight path.\n\nAlternatively, if the player continues DOWN, moving to (3,2). Then, direction is DOWN. Next move could be RIGHT (since RIGHT is not opposite of DOWN). So (3,2) → (4,2) → (5,2) → (6,2), then right to (6,3). That's also possible.\n\nBut which is better? Let's check if moving RIGHT now would block any paths. The snake's body after moving RIGHT would be (1,2) (old S), (2,2) (old H, now S), (2,3) (new H). So the body is (1,2), (2,2), (2,3). Then, moving down from (2,3) to (3,3) would be safe, as (3,3) is empty.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now: new head at (3,2). Body would be (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). Then moving down again to (4,2), body becomes (2,2), (3,2), (4,2). Then (5,2), (6,2). All these positions are empty, so safe.\n\nSo both paths are safe. But the apple at (6,3) is in column 3, so if the snake is in column 3, moving down would reach it faster. So perhaps turning RIGHT now to get into column 3 is better.\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any immediate dangers? The snake's body is in row 1, columns 1 and 2. The head is in row 2, column 2. So if the snake moves UP (which is not allowed), it would go to row 1, column 2, which is S (body), causing collision. But the player can't choose UP, so that's not a problem.\n\nSo possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLEFT: moving to (2,1). Then, the next positions would be (2,1), (3,1), etc. But column 1 is near the left wall (column 0 is wall). So moving left might limit movement, and there's no apple in that direction. The apples are on the right side (columns 3,5,6). So moving left is probably not a good idea.\n\nSo between DOWN and RIGHT. Let's compare:\n\nIf we choose RIGHT:\n\n- Next head position: (2,3) (safe)\n- Then, can move down towards (6,3) apple.\n\nIf we choose DOWN:\n\n- Next head position: (3,2) (safe)\n- Then, can move right towards (6,3) apple.\n\nEither way, but perhaps RIGHT is better because (2,3) is closer to column 3 where the apple is. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head (2,2). Apple at (6,3). The difference in rows is 6-2=4, columns 3-2=1. So moving right once (column 3) then down 4 times (rows 3,4,5,6) reaches the apple. That's 5 steps.\n\nIf moving down first to (3,2), then right to (3,3), then down 3 times (4,3;5,3;6,3). That's also 5 steps (down, right, down, down, down). So same steps.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT now allows the snake to be in a better position. Let's check if there are other apples. The other apples are at (6,5) and (5,6). If the snake is in column 3, moving right later can reach (6,5) as well.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now is safe. Let's confirm that (3,2) is empty. The row 3 is \"#      #\", so (3,2) is a space. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nIs there any reason not to move DOWN? The current direction is DOWN, so moving in the same direction is allowed. The next position is safe, and it's a valid move.\n\nSo both directions (DOWN and RIGHT) are possible. But which is better? Let's see if there's any immediate apple in the path.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2). At (6,2), moving right to (6,3) (apple). So that's an apple in 4 steps (from (3,2) to (6,3) is 3 steps down and 1 right). So total steps from now: 1 (down) + 3 (down) + 1 (right) = 5 steps.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (2,3), then (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) (apple). That's 4 steps (right, down, down, down, down). So 1 (right) + 4 (down) = 5 steps. Same.\n\nBut maybe the snake's body is in row 1, so moving down doesn't block the path. Both paths are safe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best choice is to continue moving DOWN, as changing direction may not be necessary. But I need to make sure that moving DOWN is safe.\n\nYes, (3,2) is empty, so moving DOWN is safe and leads towards the lower part of the board where apples are. So the answer could be DOWN.\n\n\n########\n#SS    #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\n- **Snake Position**: Head ('H') at (row 2, column 2). Body ('S') at (row 1, column 1) and (row 1, column 2).\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 5, column 6), (row 6, column 3), and (row 6, column 5).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN (snake is moving downward).\n- **Constraints**: Snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid), so possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (row 2, column 1). This position is empty, but it leads toward the left wall (column 0) and away from all apples. No immediate benefit.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (row 2, column 3). This position is empty and moves the snake closer to the apple at (row 6, column 3). However, the snake would need additional steps to reach the apple.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving down (current direction) takes the head to (row 3, column 2). This position is empty and continues the snake’s path toward the lower half of the board, where apples are clustered. The snake can then proceed downward to (row 4, column 2), (row 5, column 2), and (row 6, column 2), then turn right to reach the apple at (row 6, column 3) in subsequent moves. This path is safe and directly progresses toward an apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nContinuing in the current direction (DOWN) is safe, avoids unnecessary turns, and keeps the snake on a path toward the nearest apples. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # S    # → So at position (1,1) there's an 'S' (body segment)\nRow 2: # S    # → (2,1) is 'S'\nRow 3: # H    # → (3,1) is 'H' (head)\nRow 4: #      # → empty\nRow 5: #     A# → (5,5) is 'A' (apple)\nRow 6: #  A A # → (6,2) and (6,4) are 'A's\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, and the current epoch is 11. The snake's head is at (3,1) (assuming rows are 0-based from top to bottom). Since the direction is DOWN, the snake is moving downward. Let's confirm the snake's body. The head is at (3,1). The body segments are at (1,1) and (2,1). So the snake's body is from (1,1) to (2,1) to (3,1) (head). That makes sense; the snake was moving down, so the body follows.\n\nNow, the snake moves one square in the current direction unless a new direction is given, but the new direction can't be the reverse. Since current direction is DOWN, the possible directions the player can choose are UP (reverse? Wait, no. The rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. Reversing direction would be if the current direction is UP, then DOWN is reverse; current is DOWN, reverse is UP. Similarly, LEFT and RIGHT are reverses. So if current direction is DOWN, the player can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. Because choosing UP would be reversing (since moving down, then up would make the head go back into the body, which is a collision).\n\nWait, let's clarify: The snake cannot reverse direction. So if the current direction is DOWN, the next direction can't be UP. Because that would make the head move back into the previous position of the body. Because the body follows the head. For example, if the snake is moving down, the head is at (3,1), the body is at (2,1) and (1,1). If the snake were to turn UP, the next head position would be (2,1), which is where the body is. That's a collision, so that's invalid. So the allowed directions are DOWN (continue), LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nThe goal is to eat apples and avoid collision. Let's see where the head will move next based on the direction chosen.\n\nCurrent head position is (3,1). Let's list possible directions and their next head positions:\n\n- If direction is DOWN: next head position is (4,1). Let's check if that's a valid position. The cell (4,1) is in row 4, column 1. Looking at row 4: #      # → so (4,1) is empty (since row 4 has ' ' in columns 1-6). So that's safe. Then, the body would shift. The current body is (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) (head). When moving down, the new head is (4,1), and the body becomes (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) (since the tail moves up). Wait, no: the snake's body is the previous positions of the head. So when the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the one in front. So the length of the snake is 3 (head + two bodies). So when moving, the new head is (4,1). The body segments would be (3,1) (old head), (2,1) (old body), and (1,1) (old body). Wait, but the original body was (1,1) and (2,1), and the head was (3,1). So the snake's length is 3. So when moving, the new head is (4,1), and the body segments are (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) → but since the length is 3, the tail (1,1) would stay? Wait, no. The snake's length increases when it eats an apple. Initially, the snake has length 1 (only head). Each time it eats an apple, length increases by 1. So in the current state, the snake has two 'S's (body) and one 'H' (head), so length is 3. So when moving, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (the last body segment) is removed. Because the snake moves forward, the body follows, and the tail moves forward. Let's think with an example.\n\nSuppose the snake is H (length 1). Moving down, head goes to new position, no body. If it's H with a body S (length 2), moving down: new head is (next pos), body is old head. So the tail (old body) is removed. So in the current scenario, the snake's body is S (1,1), S (2,1), H (3,1). So length is 3. When moving, if the head moves to (4,1), then the body becomes (3,1) (old head), (2,1) (old body), and the tail (1,1) would be removed, because the length remains 3 unless an apple is eaten. So the new body positions would be (3,1), (2,1), and the new head (4,1). So (1,1) would become empty. So after moving down, the new head is (4,1), which is empty. That's safe.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: next head position is (3,0). But (3,0) is a wall (since the first column is 0, which is '#'). Because row 3 is \"# H    #\", so column 0 is '#', column 1 is 'H'. So moving left would take the head to (3,0), which is a wall. Collision → game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: next head position is (3,2). Let's check (3,2). Row 3 is \"# H    #\", so columns 0: '#', 1: 'H', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' '. So (3,2) is empty. So that's safe. Then, the body would shift. The new head is (3,2), body segments are (3,1) (old head), (2,1) (old body), and (1,1) (old body). So (1,1) would be removed if no apple is eaten. But (3,2) is empty, so no apple eaten. So the new board would have H at (3,2), S at (3,1) and (2,1).\n\nIf direction is UP: next head position is (2,1). (2,1) is currently 'S' (body). So moving up would make the head collide with the body → game over. So UP is invalid (reverse direction and collision).\n\nSo possible directions are DOWN and RIGHT. Let's see which one leads to apples.\n\nThe apples are at (5,5), (6,2), (6,4). Let's see the positions.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: next head is (4,1). Then, the next move (epoch 12) would have direction as whatever we choose. Let's think about the path to apples. The snake is at (4,1) after moving down. Then, possible directions (since current direction would be DOWN, unless we change it). Let's see the positions of apples. (6,2) is in row 6, column 2. (6,4) in row 6, column 4. (5,5) in row 5, column 5.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose RIGHT: next head is (3,2). Then, the current direction becomes RIGHT (since we changed direction from DOWN to RIGHT). Then, next move could be RIGHT again, or UP\/DOWN (but not LEFT, which is reverse). Let's see (3,2) is adjacent to (3,3) if moving right. But (3,2) is safe.\n\nBut let's check if moving down now would lead to an apple. The next position (4,1) is empty, so no apple. Then, the next move (epoch 12) would be the next direction. Let's think about the apple positions. The snake is currently at (3,1), body at (2,1), (1,1). The apples are in row 5 (column 5), row 6 (columns 2 and 4).\n\nIf we go down to (4,1), then next possible directions (since direction is now DOWN). Then, moving down again to (5,1). Row 5 is \"#     A#\" → (5,1) is ' ' (since columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'A'). So (5,1) is safe. Then, moving down again to (6,1). Row 6 is \"#  A A #\" → (6,1) is ' ' (column 1). Then, moving down to (7,1), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). So that's bad. So perhaps moving down isn't the best path.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT now (epoch 11), head moves to (3,2). Then, current direction is RIGHT. Next possible directions: RIGHT, UP, DOWN (since LEFT is reverse). Let's see (3,2) is in row 3, column 2. Then, moving right to (3,3), (3,4), etc. Let's see (3,2) is adjacent to (6,2) (apple at (6,2)). So if the snake moves right, then down towards row 6, column 2. That apple is in row 6, column 2. So (3,2) → moving down (if direction is DOWN) would take the snake towards row 4, column 2; row 5, column 2; row 6, column 2 (apple). That's a possible path. Let's check:\n\nCurrent head (3,1) → direction RIGHT → new head (3,2) (epoch 11). Then, direction DOWN (epoch 12). Then, head moves to (4,2). Then, direction DOWN again (epoch 13) → (5,2). Then, direction DOWN (epoch 14) → (6,2), which is the apple. So that's a path to eat that apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we go down first (epoch 11: direction DOWN → head (4,1)), then direction RIGHT (epoch 12: direction RIGHT → head (4,2)), then direction DOWN (epoch 13 → (5,2)), then (6,2) (epoch 14) → apple. So either way, but perhaps moving RIGHT first allows the snake to position towards the apple in (6,2) more directly.\n\nAlso, check if there's any immediate apples in the next move. The current head (3,1) moving in any direction:\n\n- DOWN → (4,1): no apple.\n- RIGHT → (3,2): no apple.\nSo no immediate apple in the next step. So the choice is between moving down or right, both safe. Which is better? Let's check for possible collisions in the future.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (3,2), then the snake's body would be (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) (since the tail (1,1) is removed if no apple is eaten). So the new body positions are (3,1) and (2,1), head at (3,2). So the snake is now in positions (3,2), (3,1), (2,1). That's a 90-degree turn, but no collision. Then, moving down from (3,2) to (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) (apple). That's a safe path.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (4,1), the body becomes (3,1), (2,1), and (1,1) is removed. So the snake's positions are (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). Then, moving right to (4,2), (4,3), etc. That's also safe, but perhaps moving right now gives a better path towards the apples in row 6.\n\nAnother apple is at (6,4). Let's see: (6,4) is in row 6, column 4. If the snake is at (3,2) (after moving right), then moving right to (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) (apple). That's another path. So moving right gives more options.\n\nAlso, moving left is invalid (wall), up is invalid (body collision). So the options are DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nWhich direction is better? Since both are safe, but perhaps moving RIGHT allows the snake to approach the apples in row 6 (columns 2 and 4) more efficiently. So I think the best choice is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3,1) (row 3, column 1) with a current direction of DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid), and moving LEFT would hit the wall (column 0 is a wall). This leaves DOWN and RIGHT as valid options. \n\n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (4,1), which is empty. This is safe but does not immediately approach any apples.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (3,2), which is empty. This positions the snake closer to apples at (6,2) and (6,4) in row 6, allowing a path to reach those apples in subsequent moves.  \n\nSince RIGHT better positions the snake to reach apples, it is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's state.\n\nThe game board is 8x8 with walls as '#'. Let's parse the board row by row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so columns 1-6 are empty)\nRow 2: # S    # (column 2 is 'S', others 1-6 are empty except column 2)\nRow 3: # SH   # (column 2 is 'S', column 3 is 'H' (head))\nRow 4: #      # (empty)\nRow 5: #     A# (column 5 is 'A')\nRow 6: #  A A # (columns 2 and 4 are 'A's)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe snake's head is at row 3, column 3 (since row 3 is \"# SH   #\", so positions are 0-based: row 3, columns 1: '#', 2: 'S', 3: 'H', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'). So H is (3,3). The body 'S' is at (3,2) and (2,2) because row 2 has 'S' at column 2. So the snake's body segments are (2,2), (3,2), and the head is (3,3). The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake is moving right. The snake's length is 3 (since there's H and two S's). \n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is RIGHT, the snake can't go LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since reversing to LEFT is not allowed).\n\nNow, let's think about where the head will move next. The next position depends on the direction chosen. Let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. If direction is RIGHT (current direction), next head position is (3,4). Let's check if that's safe. (3,4) is in row 3, column 4. Looking at the current board, row 3, column 4 is empty (since the row is \"# SH   #\", so after H (column 3) is column 4: ' '). So (3,4) is empty. No collision with body or wall. So moving RIGHT here is safe.\n\n2. If direction is UP: the head would move to (2,3). Let's check (2,3). The current row 2 is \"# S    #\", so column 3 is ' ' (since S is at column 2). So (2,3) is empty. No collision with body. The body segments are (2,2), (3,2), (3,3) (head). So (2,3) is not a body part, so safe.\n\n3. If direction is DOWN: head moves to (4,3). Row 4 is \"#      #\", so column 3 is ' ', so (4,3) is empty. Safe.\n\n4. LEFT is not allowed because it's the reverse of current direction (RIGHT → LEFT is reversing, which is invalid).\n\nNow, we need to check if any of these directions lead to eating an apple. Let's look for apples on the board. The apples are in row 5, column 5 (A), row 6, column 2 (A), and row 6, column 4 (A).\n\nCurrent head is (3,3). Let's see next positions:\n\n- RIGHT: (3,4). Check if (3,4) has an apple. Current board row 3 is \"# SH   #\", so (3,4) is ' ', no apple.\n\n- UP: (2,3). Row 2 is \"# S    #\", (2,3) is ' ', no apple.\n\n- DOWN: (4,3). Row 4 is \"#      #\", (4,3) is ' ', no apple.\n\nSo none of the immediate next positions have an apple. So the priority is to avoid collision and move towards apples.\n\nLet's look at the positions of apples:\n\nApple 1: (5,5) (row 5, column 5)\nApple 2: (6,2) (row 6, column 2)\nApple 3: (6,4) (row 6, column 4)\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,3). Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf the snake continues moving RIGHT, next position (3,4). Then, possible directions could be RIGHT again (to (3,5)), but let's check (3,5): row 3 is \"# SH   #\", so (3,5) is ' ', so safe. Then, (3,6) would be row 3, column 6: ' ', since row 3 is \"# SH   #\", columns 1-6: 1 is '#', 2:S, 3:H, 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (3,6) is ' ', but that's adjacent to the wall (column 7 is '#'). So (3,6) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves DOWN (to (4,3)), then next possible directions could be DOWN again (to (5,3)), which is row 5, column 3. Row 5 is \"#     A#\", columns 1-6: 1 is '#', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (5,3) is ' ', safe. Then (5,3) to (5,4) (RIGHT) would get closer to the apple at (5,5). So (5,4) is ' ', (5,5) is 'A' — that's the apple. So moving DOWN then RIGHT would reach that apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP (to (2,3)), then maybe UP again (to (1,3)), but row 1 is \"#      #\", so (1,3) is ' ', safe. Then moving RIGHT towards (1,4), (1,5), etc. But there are no apples in row 1. So that path might not be as good.\n\nThe apples in row 6: (6,2) and (6,4). To reach (6,2), the snake would need to go down from (3,3) to (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), then LEFT to (6,2). (6,3) is row 6, column 3. Row 6 is \"#  A A #\", columns 1-6: 1: '#', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (6,3) is ' ', safe. Then LEFT to (6,2) (apple). That's a possible path.\n\nThe apple at (6,4) is in row 6, column 4. So from (3,3), moving DOWN to (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), then RIGHT to (6,4) (apple). That's another path.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is in row 5, column 5. So from (3,3), moving RIGHT to (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) (but (3,6) is column 6, which is safe). Then DOWN to (4,6), (5,6) (but row 5, column 6 is ' ' (since row 5 is \"#     A#\", column 6 is ' ' because column 5 is 'A'). So (5,5) is the apple. So (3,3) → (3,4) → (3,5) → (4,5) → (5,5) (apple). That's a path.\n\nSo which direction to choose now? The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake can continue moving RIGHT. Let's check if moving RIGHT is safe. The next position (3,4) is empty, no body. The body is at (2,2), (3,2), (3,3) (head). So (3,4) is safe. So moving RIGHT is possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN. Let's check if moving DOWN would lead to a better path. The next position (4,3) is empty, safe.\n\nBut perhaps the best option is to move towards the nearest apples. Let's calculate the distance from the head (3,3) to each apple:\n\nApple (5,5): distance is (5-3) + (5-3) = 2 + 2 = 4 (Manhattan distance)\nApple (6,2): (6-3) + (3-2) = 3 + 1 = 4\nApple (6,4): (6-3) + (4-3) = 3 +1 =4. All are same distance.\n\nSo maybe the direction that allows the snake to have the most flexibility. Since current direction is RIGHT, moving RIGHT is natural. Let's check possible collisions in the next steps.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (3,4). The new head is (3,4). The body will follow. The previous head (3,3) becomes 'S', and the body (3,2) stays as 'S', (2,2) as 'S'. So the new body would be (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) (head). Then next move could be RIGHT again to (3,5), which is safe. Then (3,5) is empty, so moving RIGHT again. Then (3,6) (safe). Then moving DOWN to (4,6), (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) (apple). That's a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves DOWN to (4,3), then next move could be DOWN to (5,3), then RIGHT to (5,4), then RIGHT to (5,5) (apple). That's also 4 steps. So either direction could work.\n\nBut since the snake is currently moving RIGHT, and reversing is not allowed, but moving RIGHT is allowed. The question is which direction is safe and leads towards apples.\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any possible collisions if the snake moves in a certain direction. For example, if the snake moves UP to (2,3). The new head is (2,3). The body would be (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3). Then next move could be UP to (1,3), which is safe, but then moving towards the top, which has no apples, so maybe not the best.\n\nSo between RIGHT, DOWN, and UP. UP seems less optimal. So between RIGHT and DOWN.\n\nIf we move RIGHT, the next position is (3,4), which is safe. If we move DOWN, (4,3) is safe. Let's see if any of these directions could lead to a collision in the next steps. For example, if the snake moves RIGHT, (3,4) is safe, then (3,5) is safe, (3,6) is safe (column 6 is within 1-6, since walls are 0 and 7). Then (3,6) to (4,6) (DOWN), which is safe. (4,6) to (5,6) (DOWN), row 5, column 6 is ' ' (row 5 is \"#     A#\", column 5 is 'A', column 6 is ' '). Then (5,6) to (5,5) (LEFT) which is the apple. That's a valid path.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (4,3), then (5,3) (DOWN again), (5,3) is row 5, column 3: ' ', then (5,4) (RIGHT), (5,5) (RIGHT) which is the apple. That's also 3 steps (current epoch 12, next steps would be 13,14,15). So either direction is possible.\n\nBut perhaps the best immediate direction is to continue moving RIGHT. Because the current direction is RIGHT, and changing direction may not be necessary unless there's a reason. Since moving RIGHT is safe, and there's no immediate danger, that's a good choice.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n# S    #\n# SH   #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (3,3) (row 3, column 3). Body segments (S) are at (3,2) and (2,2). Current direction is RIGHT.\n- **Valid Moves**: The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n- **Safety Check**:\n  - **RIGHT**: Next head position is (3,4). This cell is empty (no wall or body collision). Safe.\n  - **UP**: Next head position is (2,3). This cell is empty (no wall or body collision). Safe.\n  - **DOWN**: Next head position is (4,3). This cell is empty (no wall or body collision). Safe.\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (5,5), (6,2), and (6,4). None are in the immediate next positions of the snake.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe goal is to move toward apples while avoiding collisions. All valid moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are safe. Since the snake is already moving RIGHT, continuing in this direction maintains momentum and avoids unnecessary turns. Moving RIGHT keeps the snake on a path that can eventually reach the apple at (5,5) (via (3,4) → (3,5) → (4,5) → (5,5)) or other apples with minimal direction changes.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by parsing the game board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #      # (so positions 1,1 to 1,6 are empty)\nRow 2: #      # (positions 2,1 to 2,6 empty)\nRow 3: # SSH  # (positions 3,1: ' ', 3,2: 'S', 3,3: 'S', 3,4: 'H', 3,5: ' ', 3,6: ' ')\nRow 4: #      # (positions 4,1-4,6 empty)\nRow 5: #     A# (positions 5,1-5,5 empty, 5,6: 'A')\nRow 6: #  A A # (positions 6,1: ' ', 6,2: ' ', 6,3: 'A', 6,4: ' ', 6,5: 'A', 6,6: ' ')\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at (3,4) (assuming rows are 0-based from top to bottom, columns 0-based from left to right). The body 'S' is at (3,3) and (3,2). The current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is moving right. So normally, the next move without changing direction would take the head from (3,4) to (3,5). Let's check what's there. (3,5) is empty (from row 3: \"# SSH  #\", so column 5 is space). So moving RIGHT would take the head to (3,5), which is safe. The body would follow: the current head (3,4) becomes S, the previous S at (3,3) stays, and (3,2) stays? Wait, no. The snake's movement: when moving, the head moves in the direction, and each body segment follows the previous one. Since the current length is 3 (H at (3,4), S at (3,3), S at (3,2)), the length is 3. So when moving, the new head is (3,5), then the body segments become (3,4) and (3,3). The old tail (3,2) would be removed, unless the snake just ate an apple. But since there's no apple at (3,5), the snake doesn't grow. So the new positions would be H at (3,5), S at (3,4), S at (3,3). That's safe.\n\nBut maybe there's a better direction. Let's check possible directions. The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake can't reverse to LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT. Let's check each option.\n\nFirst, possible directions: current direction is RIGHT. So the snake can't go LEFT (reverse). So options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction's next head position.\n\n1. RIGHT: next head is (3,5). Check if that's a wall or body. (3,5) is within the board (columns 0-7, so column 5 is okay, row 3 is between 0 and 7). The cell (3,5) is empty. So safe.\n\n2. UP: direction is UP. The current head is (3,4). Moving UP would take it to (2,4). Let's check (2,4). The row 2 is \"#      #\", so (2,4) is empty. Safe. Also, check if (2,4) is a body part. Current body is (3,3), (3,2). (2,4) is not part of the body, so safe.\n\n3. DOWN: direction is DOWN. Next head is (4,4). Check row 4: \"#      #\", so (4,4) is empty. Safe. No body parts there.\n\nNow, let's check the apples. The apples are at (5,6), (6,3), (6,5). Let's see the positions of the snake's head in each direction and if they can reach apples.\n\nCurrent head is (3,4). Let's see possible paths. The snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's see where the apples are.\n\nApple at (5,6) (row 5, column 6). Apple at (6,3) (row 6, column 3). Apple at (6,5) (row 6, column 5).\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (3,5), then next possible moves. From (3,5), possible directions (can't go LEFT again, unless the direction was changed, but the direction would be RIGHT, so next direction could be UP, DOWN, RIGHT again). Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,4) would take the snake upwards. Let's check if that's a good path. The snake's body is (3,3), (3,2). So if moving up, the new body would be (3,4), (3,3). The tail (3,2) would be removed (since not growing). So the new snake positions would be H at (2,4), S at (3,4), S at (3,3). That's safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (4,4). Then the snake's body becomes (3,4), (3,3). H at (4,4). Safe.\n\nNow, which direction gets the snake closer to apples? Let's calculate distances.\n\nApple at (5,6): current head (3,4) is 2 rows down (5-3=2) and 2 columns right (6-4=2). So distance (Manhattan) is 4.\n\nApple at (6,3): 3 rows down (6-3=3) and 1 column left (4-3=1). Distance 4.\n\nApple at (6,5): 3 rows down (6-3=3) and 1 column right (5-4=1). Distance 4.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (3,5), then the head is at (3,5). Apple (6,5) is 3 rows down (6-3=3) and 0 columns right. Distance 3. That's closer. So moving RIGHT brings it closer to (6,5).\n\nIf moving UP to (2,4), the apple (5,6) is 3 rows down, 2 right (distance 5). Apple (6,5) is 4 rows down, 1 right (distance 5). Apple (6,3) is 4 rows down, 1 left (distance 5). So that's worse.\n\nIf moving DOWN to (4,4), apple (5,6) is 1 row down, 2 right (distance 3). Apple (6,5) is 2 rows down, 1 right (distance 3). Apple (6,3) is 2 rows down, 1 left (distance 3). So same distance as moving RIGHT.\n\nBut let's check possible collisions. For example, moving RIGHT: (3,5) is safe. Then next move, the direction could be DOWN (since current direction would be RIGHT, so next direction can't be LEFT). If the snake is at (3,5), moving DOWN to (4,5). Then (4,5) is empty. Then moving DOWN again to (5,5). Then (5,5) is empty (row 5 is \"#     A#\", so (5,5) is ' '). Then (5,5) to (5,6) which is the apple. So that's a path to (5,6) apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first. From (3,4) to (4,4). Then (4,4) to (5,4). Then (5,4) to (5,5). Then (5,5) to (5,6) (apple). That's also a path.\n\nBut what about the apple at (6,5)? Let's see. If moving RIGHT to (3,5), then (3,5) → (4,5) → (5,5) → (6,5) (apple). That's 3 moves. So that's a good path.\n\nWhat about the apple at (6,3)? To reach (6,3), the snake would need to go left. But the snake is moving right now. If the snake goes down, then left. Let's see. (3,4) → (4,4) (DOWN) → (5,4) (DOWN) → (6,4) (DOWN). Then from (6,4), direction could be LEFT to (6,3) (apple). That's 3 moves. So that's possible.\n\nBut which direction is better? Let's see possible obstacles. The snake's body is (3,3) and (3,2). So if the snake moves LEFT (which is not allowed, since current direction is RIGHT), but other directions. The snake's body is behind it (since it's moving right, the body is to the left of the head). So moving up, down, or right is safe as long as the next cell is empty.\n\nAnother thing: the snake's current length is 3. If it eats an apple, it grows by 1. So the priority is to reach an apple as soon as possible.\n\nLooking at the positions of the apples:\n\nThe apple at (5,6) is in row 5, column 6. The snake's head is at (3,4). If moving right to (3,5), then (3,5) → (4,5) → (5,5) → (5,6) (apple). That's 3 moves. So in 3 steps, it can reach that apple.\n\nThe apple at (6,5) is row 6, column 5. (3,4) → (3,5) (RIGHT) → (4,5) (DOWN) → (5,5) (DOWN) → (6,5) (DOWN). That's 4 moves. But (6,5) is an apple, so if the snake moves right, then down, down, down, it can get that.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is row 6, column 3. (3,4) → (4,4) (DOWN) → (5,4) (DOWN) → (6,4) (DOWN) → (6,3) (LEFT). That's 4 moves.\n\nSo the closest apple in terms of steps is (5,6), which can be reached in 3 steps if moving right, then down, then right again.\n\nBut let's check the next move. The current direction is RIGHT. If we choose to continue moving RIGHT, the next head position is (3,5). That's safe. Then, in the next step, the direction can be changed to DOWN (since current direction would be RIGHT, so can turn down). Then moving down to (4,5). Then again down to (5,5), then right to (5,6) which is the apple. That's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves DOWN now, to (4,4). Then next direction could be RIGHT (since current direction is DOWN, can't go up). Then (4,5), then (4,6) (but (4,6) is in row 4, which is \"#      #\", so (4,6) is empty. Then (5,6) (apple). That's also a path. But (4,6) is empty. So (3,4) → (4,4) (DOWN) → (4,5) (RIGHT) → (4,6) (RIGHT) → (5,6) (DOWN). That's 4 moves.\n\nSo moving RIGHT now might be better to get closer to (5,6) and (6,5) apples.\n\nAnother thing to consider: walls. The snake is in row 3, column 4. The walls are at row 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7. So the snake is safely away from walls. So no immediate wall collision risk.\n\nWhat about self-collision? The current body is (3,3) and (3,2). So if the snake moves UP, the new head is (2,4). The body would be (3,4) and (3,3). So (2,4) is not overlapping with the body, safe. If moving DOWN, (4,4), body (3,4) and (3,3), safe. If moving RIGHT, (3,5), body (3,4) and (3,3), safe.\n\nSo all three directions are safe. Now, which one leads to the apple fastest?\n\nThe apple at (5,6) is in row 5, column 6. Let's see the steps from current head (3,4):\n\nOption 1: Move RIGHT (current direction) to (3,5). Then direction can be DOWN. So (3,5) → (4,5) (DOWN). Then (4,5) → (5,5) (DOWN). Then (5,5) → (5,6) (RIGHT). That's 3 steps after the current move. So total 4 steps (current epoch 13, then 14: RIGHT, 15: DOWN, 16: DOWN, 17: RIGHT). At epoch 17, the snake would reach (5,6) and eat the apple.\n\nOption 2: Move DOWN to (4,4). Then direction RIGHT. (4,4) → (4,5) (RIGHT). (4,5) → (4,6) (RIGHT). (4,6) → (5,6) (DOWN). That's 3 steps after current move. So epoch 14: DOWN, 15: RIGHT, 16: RIGHT, 17: DOWN. Also 4 steps.\n\nOption 3: Move UP to (2,4). Then direction DOWN. (2,4) → (3,4) (DOWN, but that's the previous head position, which would be body now. Wait, no. If the snake moves UP to (2,4), the body becomes (3,4) and (3,3). So next move, if direction is DOWN, the head would move to (3,4), which is now a body part. That's a collision! Oh, that's a problem.\n\nWait, let's think again. If the current move is UP. So head moves from (3,4) to (2,4). The body segments follow. So the previous head (3,4) becomes S, and the next body segment (3,3) moves to (3,4)? No, the body movement is that each segment follows the one in front. So the snake's body is a list: [H, S1, S2]. When moving, the new head is new_pos, then S1 moves to the old head's position, S2 moves to S1's old position, and the tail (if not growing) is removed.\n\nSo current snake body is H at (3,4), S1 at (3,3), S2 at (3,2). So the order is H → S1 → S2. So when moving, the new head is (new_row, new_col). Then S1 moves to (3,4), S2 moves to (3,3). The tail (S2's old position (3,2)) is removed, because the snake didn't eat an apple. So the new body after moving is [new_head, (3,4), (3,3)].\n\nSo if we move UP to (2,4), the new snake positions are:\n\nHead: (2,4)\n\nBody: (3,4), (3,3)\n\nTail (old S2) (3,2) is gone.\n\nNow, if the next direction is DOWN, the head would move from (2,4) down to (3,4), which is now a body part (since (3,4) is S1's position). So that's a self-collision. Oh! So moving UP now, then trying to go back down would hit the body. That's a risk.\n\nSo moving UP could lead to a collision if the snake tries to go down next. So UP might not be a good direction. Let's avoid that.\n\nMoving DOWN: new head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3). Then next possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since current direction would be DOWN, can't go UP). So if next direction is RIGHT, moving to (4,5), which is safe. Then next direction RIGHT to (4,6), safe, then DOWN to (5,6) (apple). That's safe.\n\nMoving RIGHT: new head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3). Next possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. So moving DOWN to (4,5), then DOWN to (5,5), then RIGHT to (5,6). All safe.\n\nSo both RIGHT and DOWN are safe. Which is better? Let's see the apple positions. The apple at (5,6) is in row 5, column 6. Let's see the distance from (3,5) (after moving RIGHT) to (5,6): rows difference 2 (5-3=2), columns 1 (6-5=1). Total 3 steps. From (4,4) (after moving DOWN) to (5,6): rows 1 (5-4=1), columns 2 (6-4=2). Also 3 steps. So same.\n\nAnother apple is at (6,5). From (3,5) (after moving RIGHT) to (6,5): rows 3 (6-3=3). So 3 steps down. That's a straight path. So (3,5) → (4,5) → (5,5) → (6,5). That's 3 steps, and (6,5) is an apple. So that's a good path.\n\nSo if the snake moves RIGHT now, then continues down, it can reach (6,5) apple in 3 steps.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is in row 6, column 3. From (3,4) moving DOWN to (4,4), then (5,4), (6,4), then left to (6,3). That's 4 steps.\n\nSo between the apples, (5,6) and (6,5) are closer. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to reach (6,5) in 3 steps. Let's check (6,5) in the current board: row 6 is \"#  A A #\", so column 5 is 'A'. So that's correct.\n\nSo moving RIGHT now is a good direction. Let's confirm that the next position (3,5) is safe. The current head is (3,4). Moving RIGHT to (3,5) (column 5 in row 3). The row 3 is \"# SSH  #\", so positions 3,0 is '#', 3,1 ' ', 3,2 'S', 3,3 'S', 3,4 'H', 3,5 ' ', 3,6 ' ', 3,7 '#'. So (3,5) is ' ', which is safe. No collision. So moving RIGHT is safe and leads towards an apple.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# SSH  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction (RIGHT), and the locations of apples ('A'). \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 3, column 4). The body ('S') is at (3,3) and (3,2), with a length of 3.\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (cannot go LEFT).\n- **Apples**: Located at (5,6), (6,3), and (6,5).\n- **Safety Check**: Moving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT is safe (no walls or self-collisions in the immediate next step).\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **RIGHT**: The next head position is (3,5), which is empty (safe). This moves the snake closer to the apple at (6,5) (row 6, column 5). From (3,5), the snake can continue moving DOWN to (4,5), (5,5), and then (6,5) (the apple), requiring 3 additional steps.\n2. **UP**: The next head position is (2,4), which is empty (safe). However, moving UP risks future self-collisions if the snake later tries to move DOWN (as the new body would occupy (3,4), blocking a downward return).\n3. **DOWN**: The next head position is (4,4), which is empty (safe). While this also leads toward apples, the path to (6,5) or (5,6) is slightly longer than moving RIGHT.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is optimal as it safely directs the snake toward the nearest apple (6,5) with minimal risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's situation.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). Let's parse the board row by row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so columns 1-6 are empty)\nRow 2: #      # (same)\nRow 3: #  SSH # → Let's break this down. Columns 1 is '#', column 2 is ' ', column 3 is 'S', column 4 is 'S', column 5 is 'H', column 6 is ' ', column 7 is '#'. So the snake's head (H) is at (3,5). The body (S) is at (3,4) and (3,3). So the snake is currently moving RIGHT, as the current direction is RIGHT. Because when moving right, the head would be in front. Let's confirm the direction: since the head is at (3,5), the previous position (before the last move) would be (3,4) (which is S now), and before that (3,3) (the other S). So the direction is indeed RIGHT, moving from (3,3) → (3,4) → (3,5).\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction, so it can't go LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since reversing is not allowed, but continuing same direction is allowed).\n\nNow, the snake's next move depends on where the head will go. Let's list possible next positions based on direction:\n\nCurrent head position is (3,5) (row 3, column 5, assuming rows start at 0). Let's note that rows go from 0 (top) to 7 (bottom), columns 0 (left) to 7 (right).\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: next head position is (3,6). Let's check that cell. Row 3, column 6: in the current board, row 3 is \"#  SSH #\", so column 6 is ' ' (since after H at 5, column 6 is ' ', then column 7 is '#'). So (3,6) is empty. But wait, the current board's row 3 is \"#  SSH #\", so columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'H', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (3,6) is ' '.\n\nIf direction is UP: next head position is (2,5). Let's check row 2, column 5. Row 2 is \"#      #\", so all columns 1-6 are ' ', so (2,5) is ' '.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: next head position is (4,5). Row 4 is \"#      #\", so (4,5) is ' '.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: next head position is (3,4), which is a body (S). That's a collision, so that's invalid. So LEFT is not allowed (since direction can't reverse, but even if allowed, moving left would hit the body).\n\nSo possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN. Now, we need to check if any of these directions lead to apples (A) to eat, and also avoid future collisions.\n\nLet's check the positions of apples. The board has apples in row 5: \"#     A#\" → row 5, column 6 is 'A'. Row 6: \"#  A A #\" → row 6, columns 3 and 5 are 'A's. Let's list all A positions:\n\n- (5,6) → row 5, column 6.\n- (6,3) → row 6, column 3.\n- (6,5) → row 6, column 5.\n\nThe snake's current head is at (3,5). Let's see possible moves:\n\n1. Moving RIGHT to (3,6): Check if that's an apple. (3,6) is ' ', so no. Then, the snake's body would shift. The new head is (3,6), and the body would be (3,5) (H becomes S), (3,4), (3,3). So the snake's length remains the same unless it eats an apple. Since (3,6) is empty, length stays 3 (H + two S's).\n\n2. Moving UP to (2,5): (2,5) is ' ', no apple. New head at (2,5), body becomes (3,5) (H→S), (3,4), (3,3).\n\n3. Moving DOWN to (4,5): (4,5) is ' ', no apple. New head at (4,5), body becomes (3,5) (H→S), (3,4), (3,3).\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a longer-term plan. The snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's see the positions of the apples and the snake's path.\n\nCurrent snake direction is RIGHT, so moving RIGHT would take it towards column 6. Let's see the next steps. If the snake continues moving RIGHT, next head is (3,6). Then, possible next directions (can't reverse to LEFT). So possible directions would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT again. Then, (3,6) is safe (no collision). After that, moving RIGHT again would take the head to (3,7), which is a wall (column 7 is '#'), so that's a collision. So moving RIGHT again next time would be bad. So maybe moving RIGHT now is okay, but next step must not go RIGHT again.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP. Let's think about the path. If the snake moves UP to (2,5), then next possible directions (can't reverse, so current direction would be UP, so can't go DOWN). Then next move could be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see (2,5) is in row 2. Moving UP again would take to (1,5), which is ' ', then (0,5) is a wall (row 0 is all '#'), so that's a collision. So moving UP twice would hit the top wall.\n\nMoving DOWN to (4,5). Then, the next direction would be DOWN (current direction becomes DOWN), so can't go UP. Then, moving DOWN again to (5,5). Let's check (5,5): row 5 is \"#     A#\", columns 1-6 are ' ' except column 6 is 'A'. So (5,5) is ' '. Then, moving DOWN again to (6,5) → which is an apple (A)! Because row 6, column 5 is 'A'. Oh, that's a good point. Let's map that out.\n\nCurrent head (3,5). If direction is DOWN, next head is (4,5) (row 4, column 5). Then, next direction could be DOWN again (since current direction is now DOWN). Then, moving to (5,5) (row 5, column 5), which is ' '. Then, next direction DOWN again to (6,5) (row 6, column 5), which is 'A'! So that's an apple. So if the snake moves DOWN now, then continues DOWN, it can reach the apple at (6,5) in two steps.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves DOWN now, then next move (epoch 15) is (4,5), then epoch 16, direction DOWN to (5,5), epoch 17 direction DOWN to (6,5) which is A. Then the snake would eat that apple, increasing the score. That's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the other apples. The apple at (5,6) (row 5, column 6). If the snake moves RIGHT now to (3,6), then direction could be DOWN. Let's see: (3,6) → (4,6) → (5,6) (which is A). So that's another path. Let's check:\n\nCurrent head (3,5). Move RIGHT to (3,6) (epoch 15). Then direction could be DOWN (since can't reverse from RIGHT to LEFT). Then (4,6) (epoch 16), then (5,6) (epoch 17) which is A. That's also an apple.\n\nAnother apple is at (6,3). That's in row 6, column 3. The snake is currently at (3,5). To reach (6,3), the snake would need to move left and down. But that's a bit further.\n\nSo, the two closest apples are (5,6) and (6,5). Let's see which is easier to reach.\n\nIf we choose to move DOWN now, the path to (6,5) is three steps (epoch 14: move DOWN to (4,5), epoch 15: direction DOWN to (5,5), epoch 16: direction DOWN to (6,5) (A)).\n\nIf we move RIGHT now, then direction DOWN to (4,6), then (5,6) (A) in epoch 16. That's two steps after moving RIGHT (epoch 14: RIGHT → (3,6); epoch 15: DOWN → (4,6); epoch 16: DOWN → (5,6) (A)).\n\nSo (5,6) is an apple. Let's confirm (5,6): row 5 is \"#     A#\" → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: 'A', 7: '#'. So (5,6) is A. So moving RIGHT then DOWN would reach that apple in two steps.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now, then DOWN, then DOWN reaches (6,5) (A) in three steps. (6,5) is row 6, column 5. Row 6 is \"#  A A #\": columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (6,5) is A. Correct.\n\nSo which path is better? Let's check possible collisions. Let's first consider moving RIGHT.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT, so moving RIGHT is allowed. The next head position (3,6) is empty. Then, the snake's body would be (3,5) (H becomes S), (3,4), (3,3). So the new body positions are (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), and head at (3,6). No collision here.\n\nThen, next move (epoch 15) direction could be DOWN. So head moves to (4,6). Check (4,6): row 4 is \"#      #\", so (4,6) is ' '. Then, body shifts: head (4,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (3,4). Then epoch 16, direction DOWN again to (5,6), which is A. Eating that apple would make the snake grow. So that's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now. Head moves to (4,5). Check (4,5): row 4 is \"#      #\", so (4,5) is ' '. Body becomes (3,5), (3,4), (3,3). Then, next direction DOWN to (5,5), which is ' ', then next direction DOWN to (6,5) (A). That's also valid.\n\nNow, are there any immediate dangers? Let's check if moving any direction would hit the wall or body.\n\nIf direction is UP: next head (2,5). That's ' ', safe. Then, the body is (3,5), (3,4), (3,3). No collision. But moving UP may not lead towards any apples quickly. The apples are in row 5 and 6, so moving UP would take the snake away from the apples. So probably not optimal.\n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. Let's see which direction leads to an apple faster. Moving RIGHT then DOWN to (5,6) (A) takes two more steps (epoch 14: move RIGHT; epoch 15: move DOWN; epoch 16: move DOWN to (5,6) which is A). That's two moves after the current one.\n\nMoving DOWN then DOWN then DOWN to (6,5) (A) takes three moves. So the RIGHT path gets an apple one step earlier. So that's better.\n\nAnother thing to check: after moving RIGHT, is there any chance of collision in the next steps? Let's see. After moving RIGHT to (3,6), the next direction could be DOWN. Then (4,6) is safe. Then (5,6) is A. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves RIGHT, and then the next direction is RIGHT again (to (3,7)), that's a wall (since column 7 is '#'), which is a collision. So the snake must not go RIGHT again after moving RIGHT once. But since the player can choose direction each step, the player can avoid that. So as long as after moving RIGHT, the next direction is not RIGHT, it's safe.\n\nSo the best immediate direction is to move RIGHT, to start heading towards the apple at (5,6). Alternatively, moving DOWN could also work, but RIGHT seems better as it's a shorter path to an apple.\n\nWait, but let's confirm the positions again. The snake's head is at (3,5). If it moves RIGHT, the next head is (3,6). Then, moving DOWN would take it to (4,6), then (5,6) which is A. That's correct. (5,6) is in row 5, column 6. So yes, that's an apple. So moving RIGHT now is a good choice.\n\nAnother check: Are there any body parts in the way of these directions? For RIGHT: (3,6) is empty. For UP: (2,5) is empty. For DOWN: (4,5) is empty. So all three directions are safe. So the choice is which direction leads to apples.\n\nSince moving RIGHT allows reaching an apple in two steps (epoch 14: RIGHT → (3,6); epoch 15: DOWN → (4,6); epoch 16: DOWN → (5,6) (A)), which is better than moving DOWN which would take three steps. So the optimal direction is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SSH #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head (H) is at (3,5) (row 3, column 5), with body segments (S) at (3,4) and (3,3). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The goal is to move toward apples ('A') while avoiding collisions with walls or the snake's body.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (5,6) (row 5, column 6), (6,3) (row 6, column 3), and (6,5) (row 6, column 5).\n2. **Possible Moves**:\n   - **RIGHT**: Next head position is (3,6) (empty). This moves the snake toward column 6, closer to the apple at (5,6).\n   - **UP**: Next head position is (2,5) (empty), but this moves the snake away from apples in rows 5-6.\n   - **DOWN**: Next head position is (4,5) (empty), but reaching the nearest apple (6,5) would take more steps than moving RIGHT.\n\n### Optimal Path:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to approach the apple at (5,6) efficiently. After moving RIGHT to (3,6), the snake can then move DOWN to (4,6) and again DOWN to (5,6) (the apple) in subsequent steps. This path avoids walls and self-collisions while targeting the closest apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so columns 1-6 are empty)\nRow 2: #      # (same, empty)\nRow 3: #   SSH#. Let's break this down. Columns 1-6: positions 3,4,5,6. So column 3 is ' ', column 4 is ' ', column 5 is 'S', column 6 is 'S', column 7 is 'H'? Wait, wait. Wait, each row is 8 characters. Let's index columns 0-7 (since it's 8 columns). So row 3 is \"#   SSH#\", which is positions 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'H', 7: '#'? Wait, no. Let's count the characters. The row is \"#   SSH#\" — that's 8 characters. Let's check:\n\nCharacter 0: '#'\nCharacter 1: ' '\nCharacter 2: ' '\nCharacter 3: ' '\nCharacter 4: 'S'\nCharacter 5: 'S'\nCharacter 6: 'H'\nCharacter 7: '#'\n\nYes, that makes sense. So in row 3 (third row, 0-based index 3), the snake's body is at (3,4) and (3,5), and the head 'H' is at (3,6). \n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So the snake is moving to the right. The next move would be in the direction of RIGHT unless we change it (but we can't reverse direction, so if current is RIGHT, the previous direction was not LEFT, and we can choose to go UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT. Because reversing direction (to LEFT) is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's check where the head is moving next. The head is at (3,6). If direction is RIGHT, the next position would be (3,7). But (3,7) is a wall (since the row 3 ends with '#'), so moving RIGHT would hit the wall, causing a collision and the game ends. That's bad. So we can't go RIGHT.\n\nSo current direction is RIGHT, but moving RIGHT next step would hit the wall. So we need to change direction. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. But can we go LEFT? Wait, the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. What's reversing? For example, if the current direction is RIGHT, the previous direction (the direction before the last move) would have been such that the current direction is RIGHT. But the snake's movement is that each step, the direction is maintained unless changed. The rule says \"cannot reverse direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly)\". So, if the current direction is RIGHT, reversing would be turning to LEFT. So turning to LEFT is not allowed. Because that's a direct reversal.\n\nSo possible directions are UP or DOWN. Let's check where those would take the head.\n\nCurrent head position is (3,6). Let's get coordinates as (row, column). So row 3, column 6.\n\nIf we choose UP: moving up would be row 2, column 6. Let's check row 2: \"#      #\". So column 6 in row 2 is ' ', so that's empty. So the new head position would be (2,6). Then, the body would follow. The current body is at (3,5) and (3,4). Since the snake's length is 3 (head at (3,6), body (3,5), (3,4)), when it moves, the tail (last body part) would stay if it eats an apple, but if not, the tail moves. Wait, the snake's length is 3. So when moving, the head moves to new position, and each body part follows the previous one. So if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (the last 'S') would be removed. Let's confirm.\n\nIn the example given, when the snake moves and eats an apple, the length increases, so the tail doesn't disappear. If it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves (so the snake's length remains the same). So, in the current scenario, the snake's length is 3 (H, S, S). So when moving, the new head is at new position, then the next body part is the old head's position, then the next body part is the previous body part's position, and the tail (the last S) is removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nBut first, we need to check if moving UP or DOWN would hit the body or walls.\n\nLet's check UP direction. New head position is (2,6). Let's check if that's a wall or body. Row 2, column 6 is ' ' (since row 2 is \"#      #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1-6: ' ', 7: '#'). So (2,6) is safe. No collision with walls or body.\n\nThen, check DOWN direction. Moving DOWN from (3,6) would be row 4, column 6. Let's check row 4: \"#      #\". So column 6 in row 4 is ' ', so (4,6) is empty. So that's safe.\n\nNow, we need to see if moving in either direction would lead to an apple. Let's look for apples on the board. The game board has apples marked as 'A'.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 5: #     A# → row 5, column 6 is 'A' (since row 5 is \"#     A#\": columns 0: '#', 1-5: ' ', 6: 'A', 7: '#'). So (5,6) is an apple.\n\nRow 6: #  A A # → columns 3 and 5 are 'A's. Let's parse row 6: \"#  A A #\". So column 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (6,3) and (6,5) are apples.\n\nSo apples are at (5,6), (6,3), (6,5).\n\nNow, the current head is at (3,6). Let's see possible moves:\n\nIf we choose UP: new head (2,6). Is there an apple there? (2,6) is in row 2, column 6. Row 2 is \"#      #\", which is empty. So no apple. So the snake would move, the tail (3,4) would be removed. The new body would be (3,6) (old head) and (3,5) (old body), and the new head (2,6). So the snake's body would be (2,6) [H], (3,6) [S], (3,5) [S]. The tail (3,4) is gone.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: new head (4,6). Let's check row 4, column 6. Row 4 is \"#      #\", so (4,6) is ' ', no apple. So same as UP: no apple eaten. Tail (3,4) is removed.\n\nIf we choose LEFT: but that's reversing direction (current direction is RIGHT, so LEFT is reversal), which is not allowed. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo, we need to choose between UP and DOWN. Which direction is better to reach the apples?\n\nThe apples are at (5,6), (6,3), (6,5). Let's see the positions:\n\nThe head is at (3,6). Let's consider possible paths.\n\nIf we go DOWN from (3,6) to (4,6), then next move could be DOWN again (to 5,6), which is the apple at (5,6). That's a good target. Because (5,6) is an apple. So moving DOWN now would allow the next step (epoch 16) to move DOWN again (since direction can be maintained) to (5,6), which is the apple. Then, the snake would eat the apple, grow, and score increases.\n\nIf we go UP now, the head would be at (2,6). Then next move could be UP again (to 1,6), but there's no apple there. Alternatively, maybe turn right (but can't, since direction was UP, and right isn't a reversal. Wait, if direction is UP, next possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (can't reverse to DOWN). So moving UP to (2,6), then maybe turn RIGHT, but (2,7) is a wall. So that's bad. Alternatively, moving UP and then LEFT, but that's possible. But the apple at (5,6) is below, so going DOWN now would be better to approach that apple.\n\nSo the best direction now is DOWN. Because moving DOWN from (3,6) takes us to (4,6), which is safe, and then the next move (if we keep direction DOWN) would take us to (5,6), which has an apple. That way, in the next step, we can eat the apple.\n\nSo the answer should be DOWN.\n\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSH#\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The snake's head 'H' is at (row 3, column 6). The body 'S' segments are at (row 3, column 5) and (row 3, column 4). The snake's current direction is RIGHT.\n2. **Collision Checks**:\n   - Moving RIGHT (current direction) would take the head to (row 3, column 7), which is a wall. This causes an immediate collision and game over. Thus, RIGHT is invalid.\n   - Reversing direction to LEFT is not allowed (snakes cannot reverse direction directly).\n3. **Valid Directions**: Only UP or DOWN are possible.\n   - **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 2, column 6), which is empty (safe). No apple is present here.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (row 4, column 6), which is empty (safe). No apple here, but this positions the snake to approach the apple at (row 5, column 6) in the next move.\n4. **Apple Strategy**: The closest apple is at (row 5, column 6). Moving DOWN now allows the snake to move toward this apple. In the next epoch, continuing DOWN would reach (row 5, column 6), where the apple is located, allowing the snake to eat it and grow.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    SS#\n#     H#\n#     A#\n#  A A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, and the current epoch is 16. The snake is moving down. Let's break down the positions.\n\nFirst, the snake's head is 'H' at position (4,5) if we count rows from top as 0. Let's confirm: the rows are 0 to 7. Row 0 is the top wall (########). Row 1 is \"#      #\", so columns 1-6 are empty. Row 2 same as row 1. Row 3 is \"#    SS#\" which means columns 4 and 5 are 'S' (since \"    SS\" is 4 spaces, then SS, so positions (3,4) and (3,5) are 'S'). Row 4 is \"#     H#\" which is 5 spaces, then H, so (4,5) is H. Row 5 is \"#     A#\", so (5,5) is A. Row 6 is \"#  A A #\", so (6,2) and (6,4) are A.\n\nThe snake's body is in row 3, columns 4 and 5 (since \"    SS\" in row 3: columns 1-3 are spaces, 4 and 5 are S). The head is at (4,5). The current direction is DOWN, which means the next move would be from (4,5) down to (5,5). Let's check that square. Row 5, column 5 is 'A' (apple). So if the snake moves DOWN (current direction), it will move to (5,5), eat the apple, grow in length. That's good because eating apples increases the score. \n\nBut wait, can the snake move DOWN? The current direction is DOWN, so the possible directions the player can input are any except the opposite direction. The current direction is DOWN, so the snake can't reverse to UP. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Because reversing direction is not allowed. So the player can choose to keep moving DOWN, or turn LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nIf we move DOWN: the head moves from (4,5) to (5,5) which is an apple. Then the snake eats it. The body will grow. The new head is (5,5) as 'H', and the previous head (4,5) becomes 'S'. The body parts behind (row 3,4 and 5) will shift. Let's see: original body is (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) is head. When moving down, the new head is (5,5). Since the snake ate an apple, it grows, so the body doesn't lose the tail. So the new body would be (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) as H. Wait, no. The snake's length increases by 1 when it eats an apple. Originally, the snake's length is 3: because head is H at (4,5), and body S at (3,5) and (3,4). So the body is two S's, making the total length 3 (head + 2 body parts). When it moves down and eats the apple, the length becomes 4. So the new positions would be: the head moves to (5,5), and the body segments follow. The previous head (4,5) becomes S, then (3,5) remains S, (3,4) remains S. So the new body would be (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), and head at (5,5). That's correct.\n\nNow, are there any collision risks if moving DOWN? The next position is (5,5), which is an apple, not a wall (walls are the borders, row 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7). So (5,5) is safe. No collision with itself because the body is at (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). The new head is (5,5), which isn't part of the body. So moving DOWN is safe and gains an apple.\n\nWhat if we turn LEFT? Current direction is DOWN. Turning LEFT would mean the new direction is LEFT. The head is at (4,5). Moving LEFT would take it to (4,4). Let's check (4,4): in row 4, the string is \"#     H#\", which is 5 spaces (columns 1-5) then H. So columns 1-4 are spaces, column 5 is H. So (4,4) is a space. So moving LEFT would take the head to (4,4). Then, the body would follow. The previous head (4,5) becomes S, the (3,5) S moves to (4,5), (3,4) S moves to (3,5). So the new body would be (3,4) → (3,5) → (4,5) → (4,4) (head). But wait, the length hasn't increased, so the tail (3,4) would stay? No, when the snake doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward. So the snake's length remains the same. So original body is (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) (head). If moving LEFT to (4,4), the new positions would be: head at (4,4), next segment at (4,5), then (3,5), then (3,4) is the tail. So the tail (3,4) would leave that position. So (3,4) becomes empty. So the new body would be (3,5), (4,5), (4,4). But (4,4) is a safe space. No collision. But there's no apple there, so no score gain.\n\nIf we turn RIGHT: direction RIGHT. The head is at (4,5). Moving RIGHT would take it to (4,6). Let's check row 4: \"#     H#\". The H is at column 5 (since 0 is #, 1-5 are 5 spaces? Wait, let's index columns 0-7. Each row is 8 characters. So row 4 is \"#     H#\". Let's split into characters: index 0 is '#', index 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is ' ', 4 is ' ', 5 is 'H', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. Wait, no: \"#     H#\" has 6 characters between the #s. Let's count: the string is 8 characters. So positions 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: 'H', 7: '#'? Because \"#     H#\" is 1 (0) + 5 spaces (1-5) + H (6) + # (7). Oh right! Because 0 is #, then 1-5 are five spaces, 6 is H, 7 is #. So the head H is at (4,6) (row 4, column 6). Oh, I made a mistake earlier. Let's correct that.\n\nLet's re-examine the game board rows:\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7 all #)\nRow 1: #      # → columns 1-6 are ' ', so (1,1) to (1,6) are empty.\nRow 2: #      # → same as row 1.\nRow 3: #    SS# → columns 1-3 are ' ', 4 and 5 are 'S', 6 is ' ', 7 is #. So (3,4) = 'S', (3,5) = 'S'.\nRow 4: #     H# → columns 1-5 are ' ', column 6 is 'H', column 7 is '#'. So (4,6) = 'H'.\nRow 5: #     A# → columns 1-5 are ' ', column 6 is 'A', column 7 is '#'. So (5,6) = 'A'.\nRow 6: #  A A # → columns 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (6,2) = 'A', (6,4) = 'A'.\nRow 7: ########.\n\nAh, that's a crucial mistake. So the head is at (4,6) (row 4, column 6). Let's re-express all positions correctly.\n\nSnake's head position: (4,6).\n\nSnake's body: row 3, column 5 and 4. Because row 3 is \"#    SS#\" → columns 4 and 5 are 'S'. So (3,4) = 'S', (3,5) = 'S'.\n\nSo the snake's body is (3,4), (3,5), and head at (4,6). So the snake's direction is DOWN. So the next move in current direction (DOWN) would take the head from (4,6) down to (5,6). Let's check (5,6): row 5 is \"#     A#\", which is column 6 is 'A'. So (5,6) is 'A' → apple. So moving DOWN would take the head to (5,6), which is an apple. That's good. Eating the apple would increase the score, and the snake grows.\n\nNow, what's the next position if moving DOWN? The head moves to (5,6). The body segments will follow. Since the snake ate an apple, the length increases by 1, so the tail doesn't move. So the previous head (4,6) becomes 'S', the (3,5) 'S' moves to (4,6), and (3,4) 'S' moves to (3,5). So the new body would be (3,4), (3,5), (4,6), and head at (5,6). All these positions are safe, no collision with walls (since 5 is row 5, which is within 1-6, and column 6 is within 1-6; walls are at 0 and 7). Also, no collision with itself because the body is at (3,4), (3,5), (4,6), and the new head is (5,6) which isn't part of the body.\n\nWhat about other directions? The current direction is DOWN, so the snake can't reverse to UP. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf we choose LEFT: direction LEFT. The head is at (4,6). Moving LEFT would take it to (4,5). Let's check (4,5): row 4 is \"#     H#\" → column 5 is ' ', so (4,5) is empty. So moving LEFT would be safe. But (4,5) is not an apple, so no score gain. The snake's body would shift: previous head (4,6) becomes 'S', (3,5) moves to (4,6), (3,4) moves to (3,5). So the new body would be (3,4), (3,5), (4,6), and head at (4,5). But no apple here.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: direction RIGHT. The head is at (4,6). Moving RIGHT would take it to (4,7), which is a wall (column 7 is '#'). That's a collision! So moving RIGHT is invalid, would end the game. So RIGHT is not allowed.\n\nSo possible directions are DOWN and LEFT. Moving DOWN leads to eating an apple (good), moving LEFT doesn't. So the best choice is DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    SS#\n#     H#\n#     A#\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,6) (row 4, column 6), with body segments at (3,5) and (3,4). The current direction is DOWN, meaning the snake is moving downward. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible directions to choose are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (UP is the opposite and thus invalid). \n\n- **Moving DOWN**: The head will move to (5,6), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. The new head position (5,6) is safe (not a wall or the snake's body), so this move is valid and beneficial.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (4,5), an empty space. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow. This move is safe but does not improve the score.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (4,7), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move DOWN, as it allows the snake to eat an apple and grow without risk of collision. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let me start by repeating the game board as given.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (empty)\nRow 2: #      # (empty)\nRow 3: #    SS# (two 'S' at positions 5 and 6)\nRow 4: #     S# (one 'S' at position 6)\nRow 5: #     H# (head 'H' at position 6)\nRow 6: #  A AA# (apples at positions 3, 5, 6)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head is at (5,6) assuming rows are 0-7 from top to bottom and columns 0-7 from left to right. The body segments are in row 3 (columns 5 and 6), row 4 (column 6), and row 5 (column 6) is the head. Wait, let's check positions more carefully.\n\nLet's index rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7). Each row has 8 characters (columns 0-7).\n\nRow 3 (third row from top) is \"#    SS#\". Let's break it down:\n- column 0: '#'\n- columns 1-4: ' ' (spaces)\n- columns 5: 'S'\n- column 6: 'S'\n- column 7: '#'\n\nRow 4: \"#     S#\" → columns 0: '#', 1-5: ' ', column 6: 'S', column7: '#'\n\nRow 5: \"#     H#\" → columns 0: '#', 1-5: ' ', column 6: 'H', column7: '#'\n\nSo the snake's body is in the following positions (row, column):\n- Row 3, column 5: S\n- Row 3, column 6: S\n- Row 4, column 6: S\n- Row 5, column 6: H (head)\n\nSo the snake is moving down (current direction is DOWN). The head is at (5,6). When the snake moves down, the next position would be row 6, column 6. Let's check row 6: \"#  A AA#\". Column 6 in row 6 is 'A' (since row 6's characters are: # (0),  (1),  (2), A (3),  (4), A (5), A (6), # (7)). So row 6, column 6 is 'A'. So if the snake moves DOWN, the head will go to (6,6), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple will grow the snake.\n\nBut wait, the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is DOWN. Possible directions the player can input are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. But the snake can't reverse. Reversing would be if the current direction is DOWN, then the opposite direction is UP. So if the player tries to go UP, that's reversing. So allowed directions are DOWN (current), LEFT, RIGHT. Because UP is the reverse of DOWN.\n\nSo the possible directions to choose are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. Next possible directions:\n\n1. DOWN: Move to (6,6). That's an apple. Eating it would add to the score. The new head position is (6,6). The body would follow. Since the snake is growing, the tail doesn't shrink. So after moving, the new body would be (5,6) (old head), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). So the new snake would have head at (6,6), then body segments at (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). That's safe because (6,6) is within the board (row 6 is not a wall; the bottom wall is row 7). So moving DOWN is safe here.\n\n2. LEFT: Current head is at (5,6). Moving LEFT would take it to (5,5). Let's check (5,5): in row 5, column 5 is a space (since row 5 is \"#     H#\", so columns 0-5 are #, space, space, space, space, space. Column 5 is ' ', so (5,5) is empty. Is there any body part there? The current body parts are (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). (5,5) is empty, so moving LEFT would be to (5,5). That's safe. But there's no apple there. So the snake would move, but not eat an apple, so the length stays the same (since it's not eating). But the next position is safe.\n\n3. RIGHT: Current head is (5,6). Moving RIGHT would take it to (5,7). Column 7 is a wall (each row's first and last characters are #). So (5,7) is a wall. That's a collision. So moving RIGHT would end the game. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\n4. UP: Current direction is DOWN. Reversing direction (UP) is not allowed. So UP is invalid.\n\nSo possible valid directions are DOWN and LEFT.\n\nNow, the goal is to eat as many apples as possible. So moving DOWN would eat the apple at (6,6), which is good. Let's confirm that (6,6) is indeed an apple. Row 6 is \"#  A AA#\". Let's index columns 0-7:\n\nRow 6:\n0: '#'\n1: ' '\n2: ' '\n3: 'A'\n4: ' '\n5: 'A'\n6: 'A'\n7: '#'\n\nYes, column 6 in row 6 is 'A'. So moving DOWN would result in eating that apple. The new head position is (6,6). The body would be (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). Are there any collisions? The new head (6,6) is not a wall (row 6 is not the bottom wall, which is row 7). The body parts are (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). The new head (6,6) doesn't collide with any of these, so it's safe.\n\nIf we choose LEFT, the head moves to (5,5). That's a safe position, but no apple. So the snake doesn't grow, and the score doesn't increase. But moving DOWN gives an apple, which is better.\n\nTherefore, the best direction is DOWN.\n\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#     H#\n#  A AA#\n########\n\nThe current snake head is at (5,6) (row 5, column 6), moving in the DOWN direction. The snake's body segments are at (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), and (5,6) (head). \n\nPossible directions to input are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN, but the snake cannot reverse direction (UP is the reverse of the current DOWN direction, so UP is invalid). \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5,7), which is a wall (column 7 is a wall in all rows). This causes a collision, ending the game. Invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (5,5), an empty space with no body or wall. Safe but no apple.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (6,6). Checking row 6, column 6 is an 'A' (apple). Eating this apple grows the snake, increases the score, and the new head position (6,6) is within the board (row 6 is not a wall) with no collision with the body. Safe and beneficial.  \n\nThe best choice is to move DOWN to eat the apple and grow. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided. \n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's list out each row to visualize the positions:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #      # (spaces in positions 1-6)\nRow 2: #      # (spaces)\nRow 3: #    SS# (so positions 4 and 5 are 'S')\nRow 4: #  A  S# (position 2 is 'A', position 5 is 'S')\nRow 5: #     S# (position 5 is 'S')\nRow 6: #  A AH# (position 2 is 'A', position 4 is 'A', position 5 is 'H' (head))\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe snake's head is at row 6, column 5 (since row 6 is \"#  A AH#\", let's index columns from 0. So row 6: index 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is 'A', 3 is ' ', 4 is 'A', 5 is 'H', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'). So H is at (6,5). \n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. Let's check where the next move would take the head if we keep moving DOWN. The next position would be row 7, column 5. But row 7 is a wall (all '#'), so moving DOWN would cause a collision with the wall. That's bad, the game would end. So we can't choose DOWN.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is DOWN, so reversing would be UP. So can we turn UP? Let's see. If we turn UP, the next position would be row 5, column 5. Let's check what's in row 5, column 5. Row 5 is \"#     S#\". Column 5 is 'S' (since positions 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'). So (5,5) is 'S' (snake's body). Moving there would cause a self-collision. So UP is bad.\n\nNext, possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT. Let's check each.\n\nCurrent head position: (6,5). Let's check possible moves:\n\n- LEFT: moving left would take the head to (6,4). What's at (6,4)? Row 6 is \"#  A AH#\", so column 4 is 'A' (since positions 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: 'H'). So (6,4) is 'A' (an apple). If we move LEFT, the head goes to (6,4), which is an apple. Eating the apple would make the snake grow. The new head is at (6,4), and since the snake was moving DOWN before, but now we turn LEFT (which is allowed, as LEFT is not the reverse of DOWN), so the direction changes to LEFT. Then, the body parts would follow. Let's confirm: the current body positions. Let's list all 'S' positions. \n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 3: #    SS# → (3,4), (3,5)\nRow 4: #  A  S# → (4,5)\nRow 5: #     S# → (5,5)\nRow 6: #  A AH# → (6,5) is H, others?\n\nSo the snake's body (S) positions are (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). The head is (6,5). So the snake's body is a sequence from head to tail. The order would be: head at (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). So length is 5 (since 1 head + 4 body parts, total length 5).\n\nIf the head moves LEFT to (6,4), which is an apple. Then, the snake grows by 1. The new head is (6,4). The previous positions of the body will shift. Since the snake was moving DOWN, the body was following. When the direction changes to LEFT, the next move's body positions would be the previous head position (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). So the new body would be (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), and the head is (6,4). That's safe because (6,4) is an apple, not a wall or body.\n\nNow check RIGHT direction. Moving RIGHT from (6,5) would take the head to (6,6). Let's check (6,6): row 6 is \"#  A AH#\", so column 6 is ' ' (since the row is: index 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: 'H', 6: ' ', 7: '#'). So (6,6) is empty. But moving RIGHT is allowed (since current direction is DOWN, and RIGHT is not reverse). But is there any danger in that direction? Let's see. The next position (6,6) is empty. But after that, where would the snake go? But since we just need to choose the next direction, perhaps moving LEFT is better because it's an apple, which increases the score and allows the snake to grow. Moving RIGHT gives no apple, just empty space.\n\nSo between LEFT and RIGHT. LEFT leads to eating an apple (good), RIGHT leads to empty space (no score). Also, need to check if moving LEFT is possible. The direction change from DOWN to LEFT is allowed (since reverse of DOWN is UP, which is not the case here). So LEFT is allowed.\n\nWhat about the other directions? We can't go DOWN (wall), can't go UP (body collision). So the options are LEFT or RIGHT. LEFT is better because it's an apple. So the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    SS#\n#  A  S#\n#     S#\n#  A AH#\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's current state:\n- **Head position**: (6,5) (row 6, column 5).\n- **Current direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (reverse of DOWN is UP).\n- **Next possible moves**:\n  - **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (7,5), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). This causes a wall collision, ending the game. Invalid.\n  - **UP**: Moving up would take the head to (5,5). This position is occupied by 'S' (snake's body). This causes a self-collision, ending the game. Invalid.\n  - **LEFT**: Moving left takes the head to (6,4). This position is 'A' (an apple). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows. No collision occurs. Valid.\n  - **RIGHT**: Moving right takes the head to (6,6), which is empty (' '). No collision, but no apple is eaten. Less optimal than LEFT.\n\nThe best choice is to move LEFT, as it allows the snake to eat an apple and grow without collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by parsing the given game board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#'. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #      # (so columns 1-6 are empty, since row 0 is 0, row 1 is 1, etc.)\nRow 2: #   A  # → columns 3 has 'A' (since positions are 1-based in the row, maybe? Let's index from 0 for each row. So row 2, column 3 is 'A'.\nRow 3: #    SS# → columns 4 and 5 are 'S' (since row 3, columns 4 and 5)\nRow 4: #  A  S# → column 3 is 'A', column 5 is 'S'\nRow 5: #     S# → column 5 is 'S'\nRow 6: #  A HS# → Let's break this down. Columns 2 is 'A', column 4 is 'H' (head), column 5 is 'S'. So row 6, columns 2: 'A', 4: 'H', 5: 'S'.\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe snake's head is 'H' at row 6, column 4. The current direction is LEFT, which means the snake is moving left (towards lower column indices). Since the direction is LEFT, the next move would be to column 3 (since moving left from column 4 would go to 3). \n\nFirst, check if moving LEFT would cause a collision. Let's see where the next position would be. The head is at (6,4). Moving LEFT (column decreases by 1) → (6,3). What's in (6,3)? Let's check row 6: \"#  A HS#\" → positions 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (6,3) is ' ' (empty). So moving LEFT to (6,3) is safe? Wait, but wait, the snake's body is made of 'S's. Let's check if (6,3) is part of the body. Let's list all the 'S' positions:\n\nRow 3: columns 4 and 5 → (3,4), (3,5)\nRow 4: column 5 → (4,5)\nRow 5: column 5 → (5,5)\nRow 6: column 5 → (6,5)\nAlso, the head is (6,4), which is 'H', not 'S'. So (6,3) is empty. So moving LEFT here is possible. But let's think about the snake's body movement. Since the snake moves, the tail (the last 'S') would move if it doesn't eat an apple. But in this case, if the next position is empty (no apple), the snake moves: the head moves to (6,3), and the tail (the last 'S') is removed. Let's confirm the current snake's body segments. The snake's body is a sequence of 'S's. Let's trace the snake's body. The head is at (6,4). The next part of the body is (6,5) (since row 6, column 5 is 'S'). Then (5,5) (row 5, column 5), (4,5) (row 4, column 5), (3,5) (row 3, column 5), (3,4) (row 3, column 4). So the body is in the order: head (6,4) → (6,5) → (5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5) → (3,4). So the length is 6 (head + 5 body segments). \n\nNow, the current direction is LEFT, which is allowed. The possible directions the player can input are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, but cannot reverse. Since current direction is LEFT, reversing would be RIGHT. So the player can choose LEFT, UP, or DOWN (since RIGHT is reversing, which is not allowed).\n\nNow, let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT: next position (6,3). Check if it's a wall: row 6, column 3 is within 0-7 (columns 0 is wall, 7 is wall; column 3 is 3, which is between 1-6, so no wall). Check if it's part of the body: (6,3) is empty. So safe. Then, is there an apple here? (6,3) in row 6 is ' ', so no apple. So the snake moves: head to (6,3), and the tail (which is (3,4)) is removed. The new body would be (6,3) → (6,4) → (6,5) → (5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5). So the body segments would be (6,4) becomes 'S', (6,5) stays 'S', (5,5) 'S', (4,5) 'S', (3,5) 'S', and (3,4) is removed.\n\n2. UP: direction is UP. Current head is (6,4). Moving UP would take it to (5,4). Let's check (5,4). Row 5 is \"#     S#\" → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (5,4) is ' '. Check if it's body. The current body segments are (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). (5,4) is not in these, so safe. No apple here. So moving UP is possible.\n\n3. DOWN: direction is DOWN. Head at (6,4) → moving DOWN would go to (7,4). But row 7 is a wall (all '#'), so (7,4) is a wall. So moving DOWN would cause collision with wall → game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\n4. RIGHT: current direction is LEFT, so reversing to RIGHT is not allowed. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT, UP. Now, we need to choose which direction is better. The goal is to eat apples. Let's check where the apples are. Apples are 'A's on the board.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 2: column 3 → (2,3)\nRow 4: column 3 → (4,3)\nRow 6: column 2 → (6,2) (since row 6 is \"#  A HS#\", column 2 is 'A')\n\nSo apples at (2,3), (4,3), (6,2).\n\nCurrent head is (6,4). Let's see the positions of the apples. The apple at (6,2) is to the left of the head (column 2 is left of 4). If the snake moves LEFT, the next position is (6,3), which is one step away from (6,2). If the snake continues moving LEFT, the next move (epoch 20) would take it to (6,2), which is an apple. That would be good. So moving LEFT now would allow the snake to reach the apple at (6,2) next step.\n\nIf the snake moves UP now, the head goes to (5,4). Then, what's the next possible moves? Let's see. The direction after moving UP would be UP (if we choose UP again) or LEFT\/RIGHT (but can't reverse). But maybe that's not the best path. The apple at (4,3) is in row 4, column 3. If the snake is at (5,4), moving LEFT would take it to (5,3). Then moving UP to (4,3), which is the apple. But that's two steps. Alternatively, moving LEFT from (6,4) to (6,3) (epoch 19 move), then (6,2) (epoch 20) which is an apple. That's better, as it's a direct path to an apple.\n\nSo moving LEFT now is better because it's one step away from an apple. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head (6,4), direction LEFT. Next move (epoch 19) to (6,3). Then, in epoch 20, if direction remains LEFT, head moves to (6,2) which is 'A' → eat apple, grow, score increases. So that's a good plan.\n\nOther options: If we move UP now, the head goes to (5,4). Then, possible directions could be UP (to (4,4)), LEFT (to (5,3)), or DOWN (reverse, not allowed). (5,3) is empty, (4,4) is row 4: \"#  A  S#\" → row 4, column 4 is ' ' (since column 3 is 'A', column 5 is 'S'). So (4,4) is ' '.\n\nBut the apple at (4,3) is in row 4, column 3. So from (5,4), moving LEFT to (5,3), then LEFT to (5,2), then UP to (4,2), then RIGHT to (4,3) → that's more steps. Alternatively, from (5,4) moving UP to (4,4), then LEFT to (4,3) (which is the apple). That's two steps. So (epoch 19: UP → (5,4), epoch 20: UP → (4,4), epoch 21: LEFT → (4,3) → apple. So that's three steps. But moving LEFT now gets an apple in two steps (epoch 19: LEFT to (6,3), epoch 20: LEFT to (6,2) (apple). So that's better.\n\nAlso, need to check if moving LEFT now is safe. The next position (6,3) is empty. So no collision. So moving LEFT is safe and leads to an apple in the next step.\n\nTherefore, the best direction is LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#    SS#\n#  A  S#\n#     S#\n#  A HS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 6, column 4).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT (snake is moving left, towards lower column indices).\n- **Valid Moves**: The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n- **Collision Checks**:\n  - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (6,4) leads to (7,4), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). Collision → invalid.\n  - **UP**: Moving UP from (6,4) leads to (5,4). This cell is empty (no walls or snake body) → safe but no apple here.\n  - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (6,4) leads to (6,3). This cell is empty (no walls or snake body) → safe.\n\n### Apple Positions:\nApples ('A') are at (row 2, column 3), (row 4, column 3), and (row 6, column 2). The closest apple to the head is at (row 6, column 2), directly to the left of the current head position (two steps left: from (6,4) → (6,3) → (6,2)).\n\n### Strategy:\nMoving LEFT now (to (6,3)) keeps the snake on a direct path to the apple at (6,2) in the next move (epoch 20). This maximizes the chance to eat an apple and grow, avoiding collisions.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position and direction. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#     S#\n#  A  S#\n#     S#\n#  AHSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 20. The snake is moving left. Let's analyze the snake's body and head position. The head is 'H'. Looking at the board, the bottom row (row 6, assuming rows are 0-7 from top to bottom) is \"#  AHSS#\". So the head 'H' is at position (6,3) if we consider rows starting from 0 at the top. Let's map the coordinates properly. Let's index rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7). Each row is 8 characters (columns 0-7).\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #      # (columns 1-6 are empty)\nRow 2: #   A  # → column 4 is 'A' (since columns 0 and 7 are '#')\nRow 3: #     S# → column 6 is 'S'\nRow 4: #  A  S# → column 5 is 'S' and column 3 is 'A'\nRow 5: #     S# → column 6 is 'S'\nRow 6: #  AHSS# → columns 3: 'H', 4: 'S', 5: 'S' (columns 2 is ' ', 3 is 'H', 4 'S', 5 'S')\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at (6,3). The current direction is LEFT, so the snake is moving left. Moving left from (6,3) would take it to (6,2). Let's check that position. The current cell (6,2) is a space ' ', right? Because row 6 is \"#  AHSS#\" → characters are: 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'? Wait, let's count each character in row 6:\n\nRow 6: index 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is 'H', 4 is 'S', 5 is 'S', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So yes, (6,2) is ' '.\n\nSo if the snake continues moving LEFT, the next head position would be (6,2). Is that a valid move? Let's check for walls: (6,2) is within the board (columns 1-6 are valid, since walls are 0 and 7). So no wall collision. Now, check if that cell is part of the snake's body. The snake's body is represented by 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 3: #     S# → (3,6)\nRow 4: #  A  S# → (4,5)\nRow 5: #     S# → (5,6)\nRow 6: #  AHSS# → (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo the 'S's are at (3,6), (4,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5). The next head position (6,2) is not in these positions, so no self-collision. So moving LEFT is possible. But wait, are there any apples in the path? Let's check the current board for apples 'A'. The apples are:\n\nRow 2: #   A  # → (2,4)\nRow 4: #  A  S# → (4,3)\nRow 6: #  AHSS# → No 'A' here (H is at (6,3), so (6,3) is H, not A). So apples are at (2,4) and (4,3). The next position (6,2) is empty, so moving LEFT here won't eat an apple. But perhaps there's a better direction.\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. The player can't reverse direction. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing would be RIGHT, which is opposite of LEFT, so not allowed). Wait, the rules say the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is LEFT, the player can't choose RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT: next head is (6,2). As before, safe. No apple here. The snake's body would follow. The current body segments are S's. Let's think about the snake's movement. When the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. Since the snake's length is the number of H + S. Let's count the S's and H. H is 1, S's are 5 (positions (3,6), (4,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5)) → total length 6. So when moving, the tail (last S) would move if no apple is eaten. But in this case, moving LEFT doesn't eat an apple, so the tail (the last S) would be removed. Wait, in snake games, when you move, if you don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward (so the length remains the same). So the snake's body is a sequence. Let's reconstruct the snake's body path. The head is H at (6,3). The S's adjacent to H would be the next segment. Let's see: H is at (6,3). The next S is at (6,4), then (6,5). Then where? Let's see row 5, column 6: (5,6). Then row 4, column 5: (4,5). Then row 3, column 6: (3,6). So the snake's body is a chain: H (6,3) → (6,4) → (6,5) → (5,6) → (4,5) → (3,6). So the tail is (3,6). So when moving LEFT, the new head is (6,2). The body segments shift: (6,3) becomes S, (6,4) becomes S, (6,5) becomes S, (5,6) becomes S, (4,5) becomes S, and the tail (3,6) is removed (since no apple eaten). So the new body would be (6,2) H → (6,3) S → (6,4) S → (6,5) S → (5,6) S → (4,5) S. The tail (3,6) is now empty. That's safe.\n\n2. UP: current direction is LEFT. UP is allowed (not reversing). Moving UP from (6,3) would take the head to (5,3). Let's check (5,3). What's in row 5, column 3? Row 5 is \"#     S#\" → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: 'S', 7: '#'. So (5,3) is ' ' (empty). Is that position part of the snake's body? The current S positions are (3,6), (4,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5). (5,3) is not among them. So moving UP to (5,3) is safe. Are there any apples there? Let's check. The apples are at (2,4) and (4,3). (5,3) is empty, so no apple. So moving UP is safe, but no apple eaten.\n\n3. DOWN: current direction is LEFT. DOWN is allowed (not reversing). Moving DOWN from (6,3) would take the head to (7,3). But row 7 is all walls (\"########\"), so (7,3) is a wall. So moving DOWN would cause a wall collision, game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT, UP. Now, which is better? Let's look for apples. The apples are at (2,4) and (4,3). Let's see where the snake can reach them. Let's see the current position of the head (6,3). The apple at (4,3) is in row 4, column 3. That's two rows up from (6,3). If the snake moves UP, then next position is (5,3), then moving UP again would be (4,3), which is the apple. So if we choose UP now, next move (epoch 21) would be (5,3), then in epoch 22, if we continue UP, we reach (4,3) which has an apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, if we go LEFT now, the head moves to (6,2). Then possible directions from there (since direction would now be LEFT, so next directions can't be RIGHT). Let's see, moving LEFT again would go to (6,1), which is safe (no wall, no body). Then maybe (6,0) which is a wall (column 0 is a wall). So moving LEFT might lead towards the left wall, but not immediately.\n\nAlternatively, if we move UP now, we can reach the apple at (4,3) in two steps. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head (6,3). Direction is LEFT. If we choose UP as next direction:\n\nEpoch 20: move UP → head at (5,3). Direction is now UP (since the direction input is UP). Then in epoch 21, the direction can be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (but can't reverse from UP, which would be DOWN). So to reach (4,3), in epoch 21, direction UP again. Then head moves to (4,3), which is the apple. Eating that apple would grow the snake, increase score.\n\nSo moving UP now is a better choice to reach the apple. Let's check if moving UP now is possible (no collision). (5,3) is safe. So the answer should be UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#     S#\n#  A  S#\n#     S#\n#  AHSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at position (6, 3) (row 6, column 3). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). We need to evaluate valid directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT) for safety and apple proximity:\n\n1. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (6, 3) would take the head to (7, 3), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). This causes a wall collision, so DOWN is invalid.\n\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (6, 3) takes the head to (6, 2). This cell is empty (no wall or snake body), so it is safe. However, there is no apple here, and this direction does not lead toward the nearest apples.\n\n3. **UP**: Moving UP from (6, 3) takes the head to (5, 3). This cell is empty (no wall or snake body), so it is safe. The apple at (4, 3) (row 4, column 3) is directly above (5, 3). Continuing UP in the next move would reach this apple, allowing the snake to eat it and grow. This direction is optimal for reaching an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list out each row to see where everything is:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so columns 1-6 are empty)\nRow 2: #   A  # (column 4 is A)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #  A  S# (column 3 is A, column 6 is S)\nRow 5: #   H S# (column 4 is H, column 6 is S)\nRow 6: #  ASSS# (columns 3: A, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at row 5, column 4 (since rows are 0-based from top, and columns 0-based from left). Let's confirm that:\n\nRow 5 is \"#   H S#\", which breaks down as:\ncolumn 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: H, 5: space, 6: S, 7: #. So H is at (5,4).\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake is moving up. So the next move would be in the UP direction, unless we change direction (but we can't reverse direction). Since current direction is UP, possible directions to turn are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP (since reversing to DOWN is not allowed).\n\nLet's figure out where the snake's body is. The body segments are S. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 4, column 6: S\nRow 5, column 6: S\nRow 6, columns 4,5,6: S (row 6 is \"#  ASSS#\", so columns 3 is A, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S).\n\nSo S positions are:\n\n(4,6), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). Also, let's check if there's more S. Let's check row 5: \"#   H S#\" has S at (5,6). Row 4: \"#  A  S#\" has S at (4,6). Row 6: \"#  ASSS#\" has S at (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). So that's all the S's.\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,4). The body is trailing behind. Since the snake is moving UP, the next position if it continues UP would be (4,4). Let's check what's at (4,4). Row 4 is \"#  A  S#\", which is columns 0-7. Column 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: A, 4: space, 5: space, 6: S, 7: #. So (4,4) is a space (empty). So moving UP to (4,4) would be safe.\n\nBut wait, we need to check if there's an apple there. (4,4) is a space, so no apple. Let's check other possible directions.\n\nPossible directions: since current direction is UP, the snake can turn LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP. Turning DOWN is a reverse, which is not allowed.\n\nLet's list the possible next positions for each direction:\n\n- UP: (5-1,4) = (4,4). Check if that's a wall or body. (4,4) is row 4, column 4. The cell is a space (from row 4: \"#  A  S#\" → columns 3 is A, 4 is space, 5 is space, 6 is S). So (4,4) is empty. Safe.\n\n- LEFT: direction LEFT means moving to (5,4-1) = (5,3). Check (5,3). Row 5 is \"#   H S#\". Columns 0-7: 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4:H, 5: space, 6:S, 7:#. So (5,3) is a space. Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: direction RIGHT means moving to (5,4+1) = (5,5). Check (5,5). Row 5: \"#   H S#\" → column 5 is space. So (5,5) is a space. Safe.\n\nNow, check if any of these positions have apples. Let's list all apple positions (A):\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 2: #   A  # → column 4: A → (2,4)\n\nRow 4: #  A  S# → column 3: A → (4,3)\n\nRow 6: #  ASSS# → column 3: A → (6,3)\n\nSo apples are at (2,4), (4,3), (6,3).\n\nLet's check the next positions:\n\n- UP: (4,4) → no apple.\n\n- LEFT: (5,3) → (row 5, column 3) → is there an A there? Row 5 is \"#   H S#\", column 3 is space. So no.\n\n- RIGHT: (5,5) → row 5, column 5 → space. No.\n\nHmm. So none of the immediate next positions have apples. So maybe we need to look further. The snake's goal is to eat apples, so we need to choose a direction that leads towards an apple, avoiding walls and self-collision.\n\nCurrent head position: (5,4). Let's see where the apples are:\n\n(2,4): that's up two rows (since current row is 5, 5-3=2). So that's in row 2, same column 4. So if the snake moves up, it could reach (4,4) next, then (3,4), then (2,4) which is an apple. That's a possible path.\n\n(4,3): row 4, column 3. That's one row up (from 5 to 4) and one column left (from 4 to 3). So if the snake moves left from (5,4) to (5,3), then up to (4,3), which is an apple. Because (4,3) is A.\n\n(6,3): row 6, column 3. That's down one row (5 to 6) and left one column (4 to 3). But moving down would require changing direction from UP to DOWN, which is a reverse and not allowed. So the snake can't go down now.\n\nSo let's map possible paths.\n\nOption 1: Continue UP. Next position (4,4). Then next move (if direction remains UP) would be (3,4). Then (2,4) which is an apple. So that's a path to an apple in 3 steps.\n\nOption 2: Turn LEFT. Next position (5,3). Then, possible directions (since current direction would now be LEFT). The next move would be LEFT again (to (5,2)), or UP (since you can't reverse LEFT to RIGHT). Wait, the current direction after moving LEFT would be LEFT, so next possible directions are UP, DOWN (reverse is RIGHT, which is not allowed). Wait, the direction change rules: the snake cannot reverse direction. So if the current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. So after moving LEFT, possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (continue).\n\nIf we move LEFT to (5,3), then from there, moving UP would take us to (4,3), which is an apple. That's one step after moving LEFT. So (5,3) → (4,3) (A) in the next move. So that's a better path, as it reaches an apple in 2 steps (current move LEFT, next move UP).\n\nLet's check (5,3) → (4,3): (4,3) is an apple. So if we turn LEFT now (current move), then next move (epoch 22) would be to (5,3), then epoch 23, direction could be UP (since after moving LEFT, direction is LEFT, so next direction can be UP, which is allowed). Then moving UP from (5,3) to (4,3) (A), which would be an apple. So that's a good path.\n\nWhat's the current snake body? Let's think about the snake's body segments. The snake's head is at (5,4). The body segments are:\n\nThe snake's body is in the order of movement. Since the snake was moving UP, the previous positions would be behind the head. Let's reconstruct the snake's body path.\n\nThe snake's length: how many S are there? Let's count the S's and H. H is 1, S's:\n\nRow 4, column 6: 1\n\nRow 5, column 6: 1\n\nRow 6, column 4: 1\n\nRow 6, column 5: 1\n\nRow 6, column 6: 1\n\nSo total S's: 5. So the snake's length is 1 (H) + 5 (S) = 6. So the body is 5 segments. The snake's body is arranged in the path it has taken. Let's think about the movement direction. Since current direction is UP, the head was moving up. So the previous position of the head would be (6,4) (since moving up from (6,4) to (5,4)). Let's check: row 6 has \" ASSS#\", so (6,4) is S. So the head (H) is at (5,4), which was previously (6,4) (S), which is part of the body.\n\nSo the body segments are:\n\nHead (H) at (5,4)\n\nThen the next segment (since moving up) would be (6,4), which is S.\n\nThen (6,5), S (since moving direction was up, the body follows. Wait, perhaps the snake's body is in the order of the path. Let's see:\n\nThe snake's movement: when moving, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So the body segments are the previous positions of the head.\n\nAssuming the snake was moving up, the head was at (6,4) (row 6, column 4), then moved up to (5,4) (current head). So (6,4) is now a body segment (S). Then before that, the head was at (6,5), so (6,5) is S. Then (6,6), S. Then (5,6), S. Then (4,6), S. So the body segments are (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 6: \"#  ASSS#\" → columns 3 is A, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S → (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are S.\n\nRow 5: \"#   H S#\" → column 6 is S → (5,6) is S.\n\nRow 4: \"#  A  S#\" → column 6 is S → (4,6) is S.\n\nYes, that's 5 S's. So the body is (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6).\n\nSo when the snake moves, the new head position is (new_row, new_col), and the tail (the last body segment) is removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nNow, if the snake moves LEFT to (5,3), is that position safe? (5,3) is (row 5, column 3). Let's check if that's a wall or body. The walls are the edges (row 0 and 7, column 0 and 7). (5,3) is within the board (rows 1-6, columns 1-6). The body segments are (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6). So (5,3) is not a body segment, so safe.\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (4,4), that's (row 4, column 4). Check if that's body: (4,4) is not in the body list (body is (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)), so safe.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (5,5), (5,5) is (row 5, column 5). Check body: (5,5) is not in the body list. Safe.\n\nNow, which direction leads towards an apple?\n\nThe apple at (4,3) is in row 4, column 3. So from (5,4), moving LEFT to (5,3) is one step left, then moving UP to (4,3) (apple) is next step. That's a good path. The apple at (2,4) is in row 2, column 4. So moving UP from (5,4) to (4,4), then (3,4), then (2,4) (apple) would take three steps. The apple at (6,3) is in row 6, column 3. But moving down from current direction (UP) is not allowed (reverse), so can't go there now.\n\nSo the closest apple is (4,3), which is two steps away if we go LEFT then UP. So moving LEFT now would be better.\n\nLet's check if there's any possible collision if we move LEFT. (5,3) is safe, as it's not a wall or body. So direction LEFT is a good choice.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  A  S#\n#   H S#\n#  ASSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction (UP), and apple locations. The snake's head (H) is at (row 5, column 4). The body segments (S) are at (4,6), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). Apples (A) are at (2,4), (4,3), and (6,3).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Current Direction Restriction**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., UP → DOWN). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n2. **Apple Positions**: \n   - (2,4): Upward path (requires 3 steps: (5,4) → (4,4) → (3,4) → (2,4)).\n   - (4,3): Left-then-up path (2 steps: (5,4) → (5,3) → (4,3)).\n   - (6,3): Downward path (invalid due to direction reversal).\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n- **UP**: Next position (4,4) (empty, safe) but no apple. Reaches (2,4) in 3 steps.\n- **LEFT**: Next position (5,3) (empty, safe). From (5,3), moving UP reaches (4,3) (apple) in the next step. This is the shortest path to an apple.\n- **RIGHT**: Next position (5,5) (empty, safe) but no apple. Less promising than LEFT.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to reach the apple at (4,3) in 2 steps, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's situation. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so positions 1,1 to 1,6 are empty)\nRow 2: #   A  # (so position 2,3 is 'A')\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #  A   # (position 4,2 is 'A')\nRow 5: #  HS S# (positions 5,2 is 'H' (head), 5,3 is 'S', 5,5 is 'S')\nRow 6: #  ASSS# (positions 6,2 is 'A', 6,3 is 'S', 6,4 is 'S', 6,5 is 'S')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head is at (5,2) (row 5, column 2). The current direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left, so the next position the head would move to is (5,1) if the direction remains LEFT. But we can choose to change direction, but we can't reverse. Since current direction is LEFT, the opposite direction is RIGHT. So we can't turn RIGHT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.\n\nWait, the rules say the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is LEFT, you can't immediately go RIGHT. Similarly, if current is UP, can't go DOWN, etc. So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nNow, let's check where the snake's body is. Let's list all 'S' positions.\n\nRow 5: #  HS S# → columns 2 (H), 3 (S), 5 (S). So positions (5,3), (5,5).\nRow 6: #  ASSS# → columns 2 (A), 3 (S), 4 (S), 5 (S). So positions (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nSo the body segments are at (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). The head is at (5,2). The snake's length is 1 (head) + 5 (body) = 6? Because each 'S' is part of the body. The initial length is 1, so each apple eaten adds 1. Let's check the apples. The current apples are at (2,3), (4,2), (6,2). Because in row 2, column 3 is 'A'; row 4, column 2 is 'A'; row 6, column 2 is 'A'. So 3 apples, which is the starting number. So the snake hasn't eaten any apples yet. Because the score would be 0. Because the initial length is 1, and each apple increases length by 1. So current length is 1 + 0 = 1? Wait, no. The example given: when the snake's head moves to an apple, it eats it and grows. The example's initial board has H in row 3, direction DOWN. Then moving down, the head (H) moves to row 4, column 0 (assuming positions), and that's an apple. Then the next state has the new head there, and the previous head becomes S. So the snake's length increases by 1. So the current snake's body is S's. Let's count S's: in row 5, there are two S's (columns 3 and 5), row 6 has three S's (columns 3,4,5). So 5 S's. So the snake's length is 1 (head) + 5 (body) = 6. So that would mean the snake has eaten 5 apples (since starting length 1, each apple adds 1, 1 +5=6). But the current apples on the board are 3. Because initial 3 apples, so if the snake has eaten 5, that's impossible. So perhaps I'm miscounting the body.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake's body is a sequence. Let's think of the snake's movement. The snake moves in direction, so each step, the head moves to the next cell, and each body segment follows the previous one. So the body is the path the head has taken, minus the current head. So the length is 1 (head) + number of body segments. Let's reconstruct the snake's path.\n\nCurrent head is at (5,2). The current direction is LEFT, which means the previous move was towards the left. So the previous head position would have been (5,3), and then moved left to (5,2). Then, the body segments would be in the positions the head was in before that. Let's think:\n\nIf the current direction is LEFT, the next move (if direction remains LEFT) would take the head to (5,1).\n\nLet's list the body positions. The S's are at (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Let's see:\n\nAssuming the snake's body is ordered. The first body segment (after the head) is the position the head was in the previous step. Then the next is the position before that, etc.\n\nSo if the head is at (5,2) now, and direction is LEFT, then the previous head position was (5,3). So (5,3) is the first body segment. Then before that, the head was at (5,4)? But (5,4) is not S. Let's check the board again.\n\nRow 5: #  HS S# → columns 0: #, 1: space, 2:H, 3:S, 4: space, 5:S, 6: space, 7: #. So (5,3) and (5,5) are S.\n\nRow 6: #  ASSS# → columns 0: #, 1: space, 2:A, 3:S, 4:S, 5:S, 6: space, 7: #. So (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) are S.\n\nSo S positions: (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nLet's imagine the snake's path. Let's start from the head (5,2). The direction is LEFT, so moving left. The body segments are the previous positions.\n\nLet's think of the snake's movement step by step. Let's assume that the snake was moving in some directions, and the body is the trail.\n\nFor example, if the head was at (5,3), then moved LEFT to (5,2) → (5,3) becomes S. Then, before (5,3), where was the head? Let's see (5,5) is S. So perhaps the head was at (5,5), then moved in some direction. Let's think:\n\nIf the head was at (5,5), direction was LEFT, moving to (5,4), but (5,4) is not S. Alternatively, direction was UP from (6,5) to (5,5). Let's check (6,5) is S. So if the head was at (6,5), direction UP, then moved to (5,5) → (6,5) becomes S. Then, direction UP again to (4,5), but (4,5) is not S. Alternatively, direction LEFT from (6,5) to (6,4) → (6,5) becomes S. Then (6,4) to (6,3) → (6,4) becomes S. Then (6,3) to (5,3) → (6,3) becomes S. Then (5,3) to (5,2) → (5,3) becomes S. That makes sense.\n\nLet's reconstruct:\n\nCurrent head: (5,2) → direction LEFT. So previous head position was (5,3) (since moving LEFT from (5,3) to (5,2)). So (5,3) is the first body segment (immediately after head).\n\nThen, before (5,3), where was the head? Let's look at (6,3). If the head was at (6,3), direction UP (since (5,3) is above (6,3)), then moving UP from (6,3) to (5,3). So (6,3) becomes the next body segment.\n\nThen, before (6,3), the head was at (6,4). Because if direction was LEFT (from (6,4) to (6,3)), then (6,4) becomes S. So (6,4) is next.\n\nThen before (6,4), head was at (6,5), direction LEFT → (6,5) becomes S.\n\nSo the snake's body is ordered as: (5,3) → (6,3) → (6,4) → (6,5). Wait, but (5,5) is also S. Where does that fit in? Maybe there's another part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (5,5) is part of the body. Let's check (5,5) is in row 5, column 5. Let's see, if the head was at (5,5), direction LEFT to (5,4) (but (5,4) is empty), then that's not possible. Alternatively, direction DOWN to (6,5), which is S. So (5,5) → (6,5) (direction DOWN). Then (6,5) → (6,4) (LEFT), (6,4) → (6,3) (LEFT), (6,3) → (5,3) (UP), (5,3) → (5,2) (LEFT). So the body segments would be (5,5) (since after (5,5) moved to (6,5)), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). That makes sense. So the snake's body is (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). Then the head is at (5,2). So the snake's path is (5,2) ← (5,3) ← (6,3) ← (6,4) ← (6,5) ← (5,5). So the body is (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). Which matches the S positions: (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Yes! So the body segments are those positions.\n\nSo the snake's length is 1 (head) + 5 (body) = 6. So the snake has eaten 5 apples (since starting length 1, 1 +5=6). The current apples on the board are 3 (positions (2,3), (4,2), (6,2)), which makes sense because initial 3 apples, but the snake has eaten 5, so new apples must have spawned. Oh, the problem statement says \"the game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board.\" But when the snake eats an apple, a new one is placed? The example given shows that after eating one apple, there are two apples left (the example's initial board has three apples, and after moving down, the new board has two apples). So each time the snake eats an apple, the apple is removed, and a new one is added? Or the example's initial board has three apples, and after eating one, there are two left (so perhaps apples are not replaced until the next epoch? The example's next state has two apples. Let's check the example:\n\nExample initial board:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSo apples at (1,5), (4,1), (4,2). Then direction DOWN. The head is at (3,1) (row 3, column 1). Moving down would take it to row 4, column 1 (which is 'A'). So the head moves there, eats the apple. The next state's board is:\n\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSo apples now at (1,3), (1,5), (4,2). So two apples. So perhaps when an apple is eaten, a new one is placed. But the example's initial has 3 apples, next state has 3 apples (row 1 has two A's, row 4 has one). Let's count: row 1: #  A  A# → (1,2), (1,4). Row 4: #HA    # → (4,2) is A. So 3 apples. Oh right, 1,2;1,4;4,2. So 3. So the example's initial has 3, next state also 3. So when the snake eats an apple (the one at (4,1)), a new apple is placed (at (1,2) perhaps). So apples are always 3. So the current game board in the problem has 3 apples: (2,3), (4,2), (6,2).\n\nNow, the current direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. The head is at (5,2). So moving left would take it to (5,1). Let's check (5,1) is within the board. The board's rows are 0-7, columns 0-7. The walls are at the edges (columns 0 and 7 in each row, rows 0 and 7). So (5,1) is column 1, row 5. The cell (5,1) is part of row 5: \"#  HS S#\" → row 5, column 1 is a space (since columns 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is H, 3 is S, 4 is space, 5 is S, 6 is space, 7 is #). So (5,1) is empty. So moving left to (5,1) is safe (no wall, no body).\n\nWhat if we choose UP? Current direction is LEFT. Can we turn UP? Yes, because UP is not the reverse (reverse of LEFT is RIGHT). So direction can be UP. The head is at (5,2). Moving UP would take it to (4,2). Let's check (4,2). Row 4 is \"#  A   #\". Column 2 is 'A' (since row 4: columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: A, 3: space, 4: space, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #). So (4,2) is an apple. So if we move UP, the head goes to (4,2), which is an apple. Then the snake eats the apple, grows by 1, and the apple is replaced (so a new apple will be placed elsewhere). Also, moving UP to (4,2) is safe? Let's check if (4,2) is a body part. The body parts are (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,2) is not among them, so no collision. So that's a good move, as it would eat an apple and increase the score.\n\nWhat if we choose DOWN? Current direction is LEFT, so direction can be DOWN. The head is at (5,2). Moving DOWN would take it to (6,2). Let's check (6,2). Row 6 is \"#  ASSS#\". Column 2 is 'A' (row 6: columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: A, 3: S, 4: S, 5: S, 6: space, 7: #). So (6,2) is an apple. So moving DOWN would take the head to (6,2), which is an apple. So that's also a possible move, eating an apple.\n\nBut we need to check if moving UP or DOWN would cause a collision. Let's check (4,2) (UP) and (6,2) (DOWN).\n\nFor UP: (4,2) is A. No body there, so safe. So moving UP would result in eating the apple, score +1. The new head is (4,2), and the previous head (5,2) becomes S. The body would then include (5,2) as the new first body segment, followed by the previous body segments.\n\nFor DOWN: (6,2) is A. The current row 6, column 2 is A. So moving DOWN to (6,2) is an apple. But (6,2) is adjacent to the body? Let's see, (6,3) is S. So (6,2) is next to (6,3), but the head moving there would not collide with the body, because the body is (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,3). So (6,2) is not a body part, so moving there is safe. So moving DOWN would also eat an apple.\n\nWhat about moving LEFT? The head moves to (5,1). That's empty. No apple, no collision. So that's safe but doesn't gain a score.\n\nSo the options are LEFT (safe, no apple), UP (safe, apple), DOWN (safe, apple). So which is better? The goal is to eat as many apples as possible. So choosing UP or DOWN would allow eating an apple now. Let's check if after moving UP or DOWN, the next moves would be possible.\n\nLet's consider moving UP first. After moving UP to (4,2) (apple), the new head is (4,2). The direction would now be UP (since we changed direction to UP). The next move would be in the UP direction (unless we change direction again, but we can choose directions each step). The new body would include (5,2) (old head) as S, then the previous body segments. So the new body would be (5,2), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). So the snake's length increases by 1 (now 7).\n\nAfter moving UP, the next position (if direction remains UP) would be (3,2). Let's check (3,2). Row 3 is \"#      #\", so (3,2) is empty. No collision.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (6,2) (apple), new head is (6,2). The direction would be DOWN. Next move would be (7,2), which is a wall (row 7 is ########). So (7,2) is a wall. So if direction is DOWN, the next move would hit the wall, ending the game. Oh, that's a problem. So moving DOWN now would eat the apple, but then the next move (epoch 23) would have direction DOWN, and the head would be at (6,2). The next move (epoch 24) would be to (7,2), which is a wall. So the game would end. So that's bad.\n\nWait, current epoch is 22. Each move is one epoch. So after the direction is chosen, the snake moves, and that's epoch 23. Then the next move would be epoch 24, etc. The game ends after the 100th epoch, so 100 moves. But if moving DOWN now (epoch 22's move) leads to the head at (6,2) (epoch 23). Then, the next direction (epoch 23's move) could be changed. Let's think.\n\nIf we choose DOWN now, the head moves to (6,2) (apple), direction becomes DOWN. Then, in the next step (epoch 23), the current direction is DOWN, and we can choose directions: UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since can't reverse to RIGHT). The head is at (6,2). If we choose UP, then the next position is (5,2), which is now part of the body (since after moving DOWN, the previous head (5,2) becomes S). So (5,2) would be S. So moving UP to (5,2) would collide with the body, causing game over. If we choose LEFT, the next position is (6,1), which is empty (row 6, column 1 is space). That's safe. So perhaps moving DOWN is possible, but need to check.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP: after moving to (4,2), direction is UP. Next move, direction can be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since current direction is UP, reverse is DOWN). The head is at (4,2). Next possible moves: UP to (3,2) (safe), LEFT to (4,1) (safe), RIGHT to (4,3) (safe). So more options. \n\nAlternatively, let's check if moving UP is better. Let's think about the current apple positions. The apples are at (2,3), (4,2), (6,2). If we move UP to (4,2), we eat that apple, so a new apple will be placed (assuming 3 apples are maintained). Then, the next step, the head is at (4,2), direction UP. Possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving UP to (3,2) (empty), then perhaps towards (2,3) which is an apple. That's a good path.\n\nMoving DOWN to (6,2) (apple), then next direction could be LEFT (to (6,1)), which is safe, then perhaps move towards other apples. But (6,2) is in row 6, column 2. The body is now (5,2) (old head), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). So (6,2) is next to (6,3) (body), but not overlapping. So moving LEFT from (6,2) would take to (6,1), which is safe.\n\nBut let's think about possible collisions. For moving UP to (4,2): (4,2) is safe. No body there. So that's good.\n\nAnother thing: the current direction is LEFT, so if we choose UP, the direction changes to UP, which is allowed. If we choose DOWN, direction changes to DOWN, allowed.\n\nSo between UP and DOWN, which is better? Let's check if moving UP leads to a position that's adjacent to body. After moving UP, the head is at (4,2). The body is (5,2) (new S), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). So (4,2) is not adjacent to any of these. So safe.\n\nMoving DOWN: head at (6,2). The body includes (6,3), which is adjacent (right next to (6,2)). So (6,2) is next to (6,3) (body). But collision only occurs if the head moves into a body cell. So (6,2) is not a body cell, so it's safe. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nBut the next move after moving DOWN: the head is at (6,2), direction is DOWN. The next possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT. If we choose LEFT, moving to (6,1) (safe). If we choose UP, moving to (5,2) which is now S (body), collision. So we must avoid UP in the next step.\n\nBut perhaps the best choice is to move UP, as it's towards another apple (the one at (2,3)), which is in row 2, column 3. If we move UP to (4,2), then next move could be RIGHT (direction RIGHT, since current direction would be UP, and we can change to RIGHT (not reverse)). Moving RIGHT from (4,2) to (4,3), which is empty, then towards (2,3) (apple). That's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP now would immediately eat an apple, which is better than moving LEFT (no apple) or DOWN (apple but possible next collision).\n\nSo the best direction is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  HS S#\n#  ASSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5,2) (row 5, column 2), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (5,1), which is empty (no apple, no collision). This is safe but does not increase the score.  \n2. **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (6,2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple would increase the score by 1. However, the next move (if direction remains DOWN) would lead to (7,2), a wall, causing a collision. Even if the direction is changed later, (6,2) is adjacent to the body segment at (6,3), limiting future movement options.  \n3. **UP**: Moving up would take the head to (4,2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1. The new head position (4,2) is safe (no collision with walls or the body). Subsequent moves (e.g., continuing up or turning right) can target the remaining apple at (2,3), providing more opportunities to eat apples.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, avoids immediate collision risks, and provides better future movement options. \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board.\n\nThe board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' as walls. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A     # (so position (1,1) is A, others in the row are empty except walls)\nRow 2: #   A  # (position (2,4) is A)\nRow 3: #      # (all empty)\nRow 4: #  H   # (H is at (4,3))\nRow 5: #  SS S# (positions (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6) are S? Wait, let's index properly. Let's count columns from 0. So row 5: index 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is S, 3 is S, 4 is space, 5 is S. So (5,2)=S, (5,3)=S, (5,5)=S.\nRow 6: #  ASSS# (columns 0 is #, 1 space, 2 A, 3 S, 4 S, 5 S. So (6,2)=A, (6,3)=S, (6,4)=S, (6,5)=S)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. The snake's head is at (4,3) (row 4, column 3). Let's figure out the snake's body positions to avoid collision.\n\nThe snake's body is represented by 'S'. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 5: (5,2), (5,3), (5,5)\nRow 6: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nWait, row 5: \"#  SS S#\" → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: S, 3:S, 4: ' ', 5:S, 6: ' ', 7: #. So positions (5,2), (5,3), (5,5).\n\nRow 6: \"#  ASSS#\" → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: A, 3:S, 4:S, 5:S, 6: ' ', 7: #. So (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nSo the snake's body segments are:\n\nLooking at the current head at (4,3). The snake's movement direction is UP, so the next position of the head would be (3,3) if it continues UP. But we need to check possible directions.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is UP, so reversing would be DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because you can't go from UP to DOWN directly.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. UP: Moving from (4,3) to (3,3). Let's check what's at (3,3). Row 3 is \"#      #\", which is all spaces except walls. So (3,3) is empty. So moving UP would take the head to (3,3). Then, the body would follow. Since the snake is moving, the tail (the last S) would move forward. But first, check if (3,3) is a wall or body. (3,3) is not a wall (since row 3's walls are at 0 and 7). And (3,3) is not a body part (current body positions are (5,2), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)). So moving UP is safe.\n\n2. LEFT: Moving from (4,3) to (4,2). What's at (4,2)? Row 4 is \"#  H   #\", so columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: H, 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (4,2) is empty. So head moves to (4,2). Check collision: (4,2) is not a wall, not a body part. Safe.\n\n3. RIGHT: Moving from (4,3) to (4,4). Row 4, column 4: ' ', so empty. Check collision: (4,4) is not a wall or body. Safe.\n\nNow, we need to see if any of these directions lead to eating an apple. The apples are at (1,1) and (2,4). Let's check the positions:\n\nIf moving UP to (3,3): (3,3) is empty, no apple.\n\nIf moving LEFT to (4,2): (4,2) is empty, no apple.\n\nIf moving RIGHT to (4,4): (4,4) is empty, no apple.\n\nSo none of the immediate next positions have apples. So the next priority is to avoid future collisions and find a path towards apples.\n\nLet's see where the apples are. Apple at (1,1) (row 1, column 1) and (2,4) (row 2, column 4).\n\nCurrent head is at (4,3). Let's think about possible paths.\n\nIf the snake continues moving UP, next head is (3,3). Then, direction could be adjusted. Let's think about where the body is. The body in row 5 and 6. Let's see the snake's length. The head is H, and the body S's count: let's count S's.\n\nRow 5 has 3 S's: (5,2), (5,3), (5,5).\n\nRow 6 has 3 S's: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nSo total S's: 6. So the snake's length is 1 (head) + 6 (body) = 7.\n\nThe snake's body segments are ordered. Since the snake is moving UP, the head is (4,3), the next part (neck) would be the position the head was in before. Let's think about the movement. Since current direction is UP, the previous position of the head would be (5,3), which is S. Because in row 5, (5,3) is S, which was the head's position before moving up. Then, the next body part would be (6,3), which is S. So the body is in a line: (6,5) → (6,4) → (6,3) → (5,3) → (5,2) → (5,5) ? Maybe. Alternatively, perhaps the snake's body is arranged in a certain path. Let's try to reconstruct the snake's path.\n\nThe head is at (4,3). Previous move was UP, so previous head position was (5,3). So (5,3) is part of the body. Then, before that, the head was at (6,3) (since direction was UP). So (6,3) is the next body part. Then, before (6,3), the head was moving in which direction? Let's look at row 6: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) are S. So perhaps the snake was moving right before. For example, (6,5) → (6,4) → (6,3) → (5,3) → (4,3). That makes sense. Let's see:\n\nIf the snake was moving right, then from (6,5) to (6,4) (direction left?), no. Alternatively, perhaps the snake's body is as follows:\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,3). The body is:\n\n- (5,3): the previous head position (since moving up from (5,3) to (4,3)), so (5,3) is S.\n\n- Then (6,3): previous position before (5,3), so moving up from (6,3) to (5,3). So (6,3) is S.\n\n- Then (6,4): if the direction before (6,3) was right, then the previous position would be (6,4). Because if the snake was moving left (from (6,4) to (6,3)), then (6,4) is S.\n\n- Then (6,5): moving left from (6,5) to (6,4), so (6,5) is S.\n\n- Then (5,5): perhaps the snake turned up from (5,5) to (6,5) (but direction can't reverse). Wait, direction was moving left (from (6,5) to (6,4)), then up (from (6,4) to (6,3)), then up (from (6,3) to (5,3)), then up (from (5,3) to (4,3)).\n\nBut then there's (5,2) in row 5, column 2. How did that get there? Maybe there's a branch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snake's body is:\n\nHead at (4,3). The body segments in order (from head to tail):\n\n(4,3) → (5,3) → (6,3) → (6,4) → (6,5) → (5,5) → (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is S. So that's 6 body segments, making total length 7.\n\nIn any case, the key is to avoid moving into any S positions or walls.\n\nNow, let's check the possible directions again. Let's check for each direction, what's the next position and if it's safe.\n\nCurrent direction is UP. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't go DOWN).\n\nOption 1: UP. Next head position (3,3). Is (3,3) a wall? No. Is (3,3) a body part? Current body positions are (5,2), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (3,3) is not among them. So safe.\n\nOption 2: LEFT. Next head position (4,2). Check if (4,2) is a body part. (4,2) is in row 4, column 2. Current body positions don't include (4,2), so safe.\n\nOption 3: RIGHT. Next head position (4,4). Check if (4,4) is a body part. Current body positions don't include (4,4), so safe.\n\nNow, which direction is better? Let's look at the apples. Apple at (1,1) (top left) and (2,4) (row 2, column 4). The head is at (4,3). Let's see the positions:\n\nApple at (2,4) is in row 2, column 4. So to reach there, the head would need to move up to row 3, then row 2, and right to column 4.\n\nIf current direction is UP, moving to (3,3), then next possible direction could be RIGHT to (3,4), then UP to (2,4) (which is the apple's position). That's a possible path.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT now (to (4,4)), then next direction could be UP to (3,4), then UP to (2,4) (apple). That's even closer.\n\nLet's see:\n\nIf we choose RIGHT direction now:\n\nCurrent head (4,3) → move RIGHT to (4,4). That's safe. Then, the next direction could be UP (since current direction would be RIGHT, so next directions can't be LEFT). Then, from (4,4), moving UP to (3,4). Then, moving UP to (2,4) which is the apple. That would eat the apple, increasing the score.\n\nThat's a good path. Let's check if (4,4) is safe. (4,4) is empty. So moving RIGHT now is safe, and leads towards the apple at (2,4).\n\nIf we choose UP now:\n\nHead moves to (3,3). Then, next direction could be RIGHT (to (3,4)), then UP to (2,4). That's also possible, but takes an extra step.\n\nIf we choose LEFT now:\n\nHead moves to (4,2). Then, to reach the apple at (2,4), the snake would need to move up and then right. But (4,2) is further from the apple (2,4) than (4,4) is. So LEFT might not be the best direction.\n\nSo the best option is to move RIGHT, which brings the head closer to the apple at (2,4), allowing to reach it in the next steps.\n\nAlso, check for possible collisions in the next steps. For example, after moving RIGHT to (4,4), the next position would be (3,4) (if direction is UP). (3,4) is empty. Then (2,4) is the apple. So that's safe.\n\nSo the direction to choose is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#  SS S#\n#  ASSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head is at (4,3) (row 4, column 3), moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid), leaving UP, LEFT, or RIGHT as options. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,1) (row 1, column 1) and (2,4) (row 2, column 4).\n2. **Safety Check**: All three possible directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are initially safe, as none lead to walls or the snake's body.\n3. **Path to Apples**: The apple at (2,4) is closer to the head. Moving RIGHT (to (4,4)) brings the head closer to this apple, allowing a potential path: RIGHT → UP → UP to reach (2,4) and eat the apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is optimal, as it positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (2,4) in subsequent moves while avoiding collisions.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by visualizing the game board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A     # (so positions (1,1) is A, others are empty except walls)\nRow 2: #   A  # (so (2,4) is A)\nRow 3: #      # (all empty)\nRow 4: #  SH  # (so (4,2) is S, (4,3) is H)\nRow 5: #  SS  # (positions (5,2) and (5,3) are S)\nRow 6: #  ASSS# (positions (6,2) is A, (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) are S)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right. The snake's head is at (4,3) (since H is there). Let's figure out the snake's body positions. The head is H at (4,3). The body parts (S) are in row 4, column 2 (4,2). Then row 5, columns 2 and 3 (5,2 and 5,3). Then row 6, columns 3,4,5 (6,3, 6,4, 6,5). So the snake's body segments are:\n\nHead: (4,3)\nThen next: (4,2)\nThen (5,2)\nThen (5,3)\nThen (6,3)\nThen (6,4)\nThen (6,5)\n\nSo the snake's length is 7 (head plus 6 body parts). Let's confirm that. The head is H, and the S's are 6 in total. So length 7.\n\nNow, the current direction is RIGHT. So when the snake moves, the head will go to (4,4). Let's check what's in (4,4). Looking at row 4: #  SH  #. So (4,4) is a space (empty). So moving right would take the head to (4,4). Then, the body would follow. Since the snake's current direction is RIGHT, the next move's direction can't be LEFT (since reversing is not allowed). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since current is RIGHT, can't go LEFT).\n\nBut we need to check the next position. Let's think: if we choose to continue moving RIGHT (current direction), the head moves to (4,4). Is that a valid position? Let's check for collisions. (4,4) is within the board (rows 1-6, columns 1-6, since walls are on 0 and 7). So (4,4) is column 4, row 4. The walls are at columns 0 and 7, rows 0 and 7. So (4,4) is safe from walls. Now, check if (4,4) is part of the snake's body. The current body positions are (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). So (4,4) is not in those positions, so no collision with self. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if we turn UP, what's the new direction? The current direction is RIGHT, so turning UP is allowed (not reversing). The head would move from (4,3) up to (3,3). Let's check (3,3). Row 3 is #      #, so (3,3) is empty. So (3,3) is safe. No collision with body. Body positions are (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (3,3) is not among them. So UP is possible.\n\nIf we turn DOWN, direction would be DOWN. The head moves from (4,3) down to (5,3). (5,3) is part of the body (since in row 5, column 3 is S). So that's a collision with self. So moving DOWN is invalid. So direction DOWN is not allowed because the head would hit the body.\n\nSo possible directions are RIGHT, UP. Let's see the apples. The apples are at (1,1), (2,4), (6,2). Let's check where the next positions are.\n\nIf moving RIGHT, head goes to (4,4). Is there an apple there? Row 4: #  SH  # → (4,4) is empty. So no apple. So the snake moves, the body follows. The tail (which is the last S) would move. The snake's tail is currently at (6,5). When moving, the head moves to (4,4), and each body part follows the previous one. So the new body would be: head (4,4), then (4,3) (old head), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4). The tail (6,5) would be removed. So the new snake's body is those positions.\n\nIf moving UP, head goes to (3,3). Check (3,3) is empty. No apple. So same as above, no apple eaten. But what's the next move? Let's see. The apples are at (1,1), (2,4), (6,2). Let's see where the snake is. The head is at (4,3). The apple at (6,2) is in row 6, column 2. The snake's current body in row 6, column 2 is A (apple), so (6,2) is an apple. So (6,2) is an apple. The snake's body in row 6 is (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). So (6,2) is A.\n\nIf the snake can reach (6,2), that's an apple. Let's see. Current head is (4,3). The apple at (6,2) is two rows down (from row 4 to 6) and one column left (from column 3 to 2). So the path to (6,2) would require moving down and left. But current direction is RIGHT. Let's think about possible moves.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,4) is in row 2, column 4. The head is (4,3). So (2,4) is two rows up and one column right.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT now, head to (4,4). Then next direction could be UP. Then head to (3,4). Then (2,4) which is the apple. That's a possible path.\n\nIf the snake moves UP now, head to (3,3). Then next direction could be RIGHT, moving to (3,4), then (2,4) (apple).\n\nBut which direction is better? Let's check if moving RIGHT now is safe. Let's check the next position (4,4). The body after moving RIGHT would have the new body positions: (4,4) (head), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4). The tail (6,5) is removed. Are any of these positions overlapping with walls or body? No, (4,4) is within the board, and the new body parts are all safe.\n\nMoving UP would take head to (3,3). The new body would be (3,3) (head), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4). The tail (6,5) is removed. Also safe.\n\nWhat about the other apple at (1,1)? That's in row 1, column 1. That's far. Maybe not the immediate target.\n\nThe apple at (6,2) is in row 6, column 2. The current snake's body in row 6 is (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). So (6,2) is an apple. To reach (6,2), the snake would need to move left from (6,3) but (6,3) is part of the body. Alternatively, the head could go down to row 5, then left, then down to row 6. Let's see.\n\nCurrent head (4,3). If we go down, but earlier we saw that moving down now (direction DOWN) would take the head to (5,3), which is part of the body (since (5,3) is S). So that's a collision. So can't go down now. So to reach (6,2), perhaps the snake needs to move right, then down, then left. Let's see.\n\nBut let's get back to the current possible directions. The possible directions are RIGHT, UP, or maybe others. Wait, the current direction is RIGHT, so the next direction can't be LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. But moving DOWN would take head to (5,3), which is S (body), so collision. So DOWN is invalid. So options are RIGHT or UP.\n\nBetween RIGHT and UP, which is better? Let's check if moving RIGHT allows the snake to reach an apple in the next steps. For example, after moving RIGHT to (4,4), the next direction could be UP. Then head moves to (3,4). Then next direction UP again, to (2,4), which is the apple. That would be good. So (2,4) is an apple. So if we move RIGHT now, then UP, then UP again, we can reach that apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we move UP now to (3,3), then RIGHT to (3,4), then UP to (2,4) (apple). That's also possible. So both paths could reach the apple at (2,4). But which is safer?\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's body. Let's see the current body. The body in row 5 is (5,2) and (5,3). Row 6 has (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). So the snake's body is in the lower part. Moving UP would take the head into row 3, which is empty. Moving RIGHT takes into row 4, column 4, which is empty. Both are safe.\n\nWhat about the walls? The head is in row 4 (rows 0-7). The top wall is row 0, bottom row 7. So moving up to row 3 is safe, as row 3 is within 1-6 (non-wall rows). Columns: current head is column 3. Columns 0 and 7 are walls. So moving right to column 4 is safe (column 4 is within 1-6).\n\nSo both directions are possible. But perhaps the apple at (2,4) is in column 4, row 2. So if the snake moves right to (4,4) (column 4), then up, that's a straight path towards the apple. That might be better.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first would take the head to (3,3), which is column 3, then moving right to (3,4) (column 4), then up. Either way, same steps.\n\nBut since the current direction is RIGHT, and moving RIGHT is allowed, perhaps that's the best choice. Because changing direction might not be necessary if moving in the current direction is safe and leads towards an apple.\n\nSo the answer would be RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#  SS  #\n#  ASSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,3) (row 4, column 3), and it is currently moving RIGHT. The snake's body segments (S) are at positions (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). The apples (A) are at (1,1), (2,4), and (6,2). \n\nThe snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., from RIGHT to LEFT), so possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (5,3), which is occupied by the snake's body (S). This causes a self-collision, so DOWN is invalid.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,3), which is empty and safe (no walls or body collision).  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,4), which is empty and safe (no walls or body collision).  \n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, both are safe. However, the apple at (2,4) (row 2, column 4) is a key target. Moving RIGHT first positions the head at (4,4) (column 4), aligning it vertically with the apple at (2,4). This sets up a straightforward path to reach the apple by continuing to move UP in subsequent steps. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by looking at the given game board.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's list out each row to see where everything is:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A     # (so column 1 is 'A', others in row 1 are empty except walls)\nRow 2: #   A  # (so column 4 is 'A' here)\nRow 3: #      # (empty)\nRow 4: #  SSH # (columns 2,3,4: 'S', 'S', 'H'—so head is at (4,4))\nRow 5: #  SS  # (columns 2,3: 'S's)\nRow 6: #  ASS # (columns 2: 'A', 3: 'S', 4: 'S')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at position (row 4, column 4). The current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is moving to the right (column increases by 1 each step). Let's confirm the snake's body positions. The body (S) is connected. Let's track the body from the head backward.\n\nIn row 4: columns 2,3,4 are S, S, H. So the head is at (4,4). The next body part (since direction is RIGHT, the previous position would be to the left). So the body behind the head is at (4,3) (S), then (4,2) (S). Then in row 5: columns 2 and 3 are S. So (5,2) and (5,3). Then row 6: column 3 and 4 are S (since row 6 is #  ASS #, so columns 2: A, 3:S, 4:S). So (6,3) and (6,4) are S.\n\nWait, let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 4: columns 2,3 → (4,2), (4,3)\nRow 5: columns 2,3 → (5,2), (5,3)\nRow 6: columns 3,4 → (6,3), (6,4)\nAnd the head is at (4,4). So the snake's body is a chain. Let's see the movement direction. Current direction is RIGHT. So the next position the head would move is (4,5) (since moving right from (4,4) is column 5).\n\nWe need to check if (4,5) is a valid position. Let's check row 4, column 5. The current row 4 is \"#  SSH #\", which is 8 characters. Let's index columns from 0 to 7 (since each row is 8 characters). So row 4: index 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is 'S', 3 is 'S', 4 is 'H', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So (4,5) is a space. So if we move RIGHT, the head goes to (4,5). Is that safe?\n\nCheck for walls: (4,5) is within the board (row 4 is between 0 and 7, column 5 is between 0 and 7, not a wall). Check for self-collision: (4,5) is not part of the snake's body (the S positions are (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)). So (4,5) is safe.\n\nBut wait, what's the alternative directions? The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is RIGHT, so the opposite direction is LEFT. So the snake can't turn to LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse).\n\nSo possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. RIGHT: head moves to (4,5). That's empty. Then, the snake's body will shift. Since the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail (the last S) will move. The current snake's length: let's count the number of S and H. H is 1, S's are (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4). So 6 S's. So total length is 7. So when moving, the head moves to (4,5), and the tail (the last part) is removed. Wait, no: when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, it moves forward, so the head moves to new position, and each body part follows the previous part, so the tail (the last S) is removed. So after moving RIGHT, the new head is (4,5). The body parts would be:\n\nPrevious head (4,4) becomes S.\n\nThen (4,3) → (4,4) (since the next part follows the head's previous position).\n\n(4,2) → (4,3)\n\n(5,2) → (4,2)?\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the snake's body as a list, with the head at the front. Let's model the snake as a list of coordinates, with the head first.\n\nCurrent snake (from head backward):\n\nHead: (4,4)\n\nThen the next body part is where the head was in the previous step. Since current direction is RIGHT, the head moved from (4,3) to (4,4) in the last step. So the body after head is (4,3), then (4,2), then (5,2), then (5,3), then (6,3), then (6,4). Wait, maybe not. Let's think: the snake's body is a contiguous path. Let's look at the positions:\n\nRow 4: (4,2) S, (4,3) S, (4,4) H.\n\nRow 5: (5,2) S, (5,3) S.\n\nRow 6: (6,2) A, (6,3) S, (6,4) S.\n\nSo the snake's body is arranged as a chain. Let's try to trace the path. The head is at (4,4). The body part before the head (since direction is RIGHT) would be (4,3) (to the left of the head). Then (4,2) (left of (4,3)). Then from (4,2), where does it go? Let's check row 5, column 2: (5,2) is S. So the body goes down from (4,2) to (5,2). Then (5,3) (right of (5,2)), then (6,3) (down from (5,3)), then (6,4) (right of (6,3)). So the snake's body is:\n\nHead (4,4) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (5,2) → (5,3) → (6,3) → (6,4).\n\nSo the snake's length is 7 (head + 6 body parts). So when moving, the head moves in the direction, and each body part follows the previous part. So if the head moves to (4,5) (RIGHT), then the new body positions would be:\n\nNew head: (4,5)\n\nBody 1: (4,4) (old head)\n\nBody 2: (4,3)\n\nBody 3: (4,2)\n\nBody 4: (5,2)\n\nBody 5: (5,3)\n\nBody 6: (6,3)\n\nThe tail (oldest part) was (6,4), which is now removed (since the snake didn't eat an apple, so length remains 7). So the new positions would be:\n\n(4,5) H, (4,4) S, (4,3) S, (4,2) S, (5,2) S, (5,3) S, (6,3) S.\n\nIs that correct? Let's confirm. The tail was (6,4), which is no longer part of the snake. So in row 6, column 4 would become empty. That's okay.\n\nNow, let's check the other possible directions: UP and DOWN.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nOption 2: UP. If the direction is UP, the head would move from (4,4) up to (3,4). Let's check (3,4). Row 3 is \"#      #\", so column 4 is empty (since row 3 has all spaces except walls). So (3,4) is safe (no wall, no body). The snake's body would then follow. The new head is (3,4). Then the body parts would be (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3). The tail (6,4) is removed. So moving UP is possible.\n\nOption 3: DOWN. Direction DOWN would move the head from (4,4) down to (5,4). Let's check (5,4). Row 5 is \"#  SS  #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (5,4) is empty. So that's safe. The new head is (5,4). Body parts would be (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3). Tail (6,4) is removed.\n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's check where the apples are. The current apples are:\n\nRow 1, column 1: (1,1) 'A'\n\nRow 2, column 4: (2,4) 'A'\n\nRow 6, column 2: (6,2) 'A' (since row 6 is \"#  ASS #\", column 2 is 'A').\n\nSo apples at (1,1), (2,4), (6,2).\n\nWe need to see which direction leads the head to an apple next. Let's check each possible next move:\n\n- If moving RIGHT: head goes to (4,5). No apple there.\n\n- If moving UP: head goes to (3,4). No apple.\n\n- If moving DOWN: head goes to (5,4). No apple.\n\nSo none of the immediate next moves will eat an apple. So the next step's priority is to avoid collision and navigate towards apples.\n\nLet's think about the snake's path. The snake is currently in the lower middle area. The apples are at (1,1) (top left), (2,4) (middle top), (6,2) (bottom middle left).\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. Let's see possible future steps.\n\nIf we continue moving RIGHT, the next positions would be:\n\nEpoch 25: move RIGHT → head (4,5).\n\nEpoch 26: possible directions (can't reverse from RIGHT, so can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT again).\n\nIf we keep moving RIGHT, head would go to (4,6) (since (4,5) is empty, then (4,6) is row 4, column 6. Row 4 is \"#  SSH #\", so column 6 is ' ' (since 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'). So (4,6) is safe.\n\nThen (4,7) is a wall (column 7 is '#'). So can't go to (4,7). So moving RIGHT further would reach (4,6) next, then (4,7) is a wall. So that's a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP from current position (epoch 25). Let's see:\n\nEpoch 25: move UP → head (3,4).\n\nEpoch 26: direction can be UP, DOWN, LEFT (since current direction would be UP now, so can't reverse to DOWN). Wait, the direction after moving UP would be UP, so possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since can't reverse to DOWN).\n\nIf the head is at (3,4), moving UP again would take it to (2,4), which is the position of an apple (row 2, column 4 is 'A'). Oh! That's an apple. So if we move UP now (epoch 25), then in epoch 26, if we continue moving UP, the head would reach (2,4) which is an apple. That's a good plan.\n\nLet's confirm. Current head is (4,4). If we choose UP direction now, the head moves to (3,4) (epoch 25). Then, the next direction (epoch 26) could be UP again (since direction is now UP, can't reverse to DOWN). So moving UP again from (3,4) would take the head to (2,4), which is the apple at (2,4). Then, the snake would eat the apple, grow longer, and score increases.\n\nThat's a good path. So moving UP now (epoch 25) would set up the next move to reach the apple in epoch 26.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN? Let's see:\n\nEpoch 25: move DOWN → head (5,4). Then epoch 26, direction could be DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (since current direction is DOWN, can't reverse to UP).\n\nIf moving DOWN again, head goes to (6,4). Row 6, column 4 is 'S' (current snake's body at (6,4)), so that's a collision. Oh, right! Because the current snake's body has (6,4) as S. So if we move DOWN to (5,4) in epoch 25, then in epoch 26, if direction is DOWN, the head would go to (6,4), which is part of the body. That's a collision. So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,4) (epoch 25), moving LEFT (column 3) would take the head to (5,3). But (5,3) is part of the current snake's body (since (5,3) is S in row 5). So that's a collision. Oh, right! The current body has (5,3) as S. So moving LEFT from (5,4) would be (5,3), which is S. So that's a collision. So moving DOWN now (epoch 25) would lead to possible collision in the next step.\n\nSo moving DOWN is risky.\n\nMoving RIGHT, as discussed, leads to (4,5), then (4,6), then (4,7) (wall). So that's a dead end, but no immediate collision. But no apples in that direction.\n\nSo the best option is to move UP now, which allows the next move to reach the apple at (2,4). Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head (4,4) → move UP to (3,4) (epoch 25). Then, next direction (epoch 26) is UP, moving to (2,4), which is 'A'. That's an apple. So the snake would eat it, grow, and score increases.\n\nTherefore, the direction to choose now is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  SSH #\n#  SS  #\n#  ASS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 4, column 4), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **RIGHT**: The head moves to (4,5), which is empty. This avoids collision but does not lead toward any apples. Further movement right would eventually hit a wall (column 7), offering no long-term benefit.  \n- **DOWN**: The head moves to (5,4), which is empty. However, the next possible move (e.g., DOWN again) would lead to (6,4), which is part of the snake's body (S), causing a collision. This is risky.  \n- **UP**: The head moves to (3,4), which is empty. The next move (if direction remains UP) would take the head to (2,4), where there is an apple (A). This allows the snake to eat the apple in the next epoch, growing longer and increasing the score.  \n\nThe optimal choice is UP, as it positions the snake to reach an apple in the next move. \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by analyzing the game board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S', apples are 'A'. The current direction is UP, and the epoch is 26 (so 74 epochs left until the game ends at 100). The snake can't reverse direction, so from UP, it can't go DOWN. The possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse).\n\nFirst, let's map out the positions. Let's list each row (rows 0 to 7, top to bottom):\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #A     # → positions (1,1) is A, others (1,2-6) are empty, (1,0) and (1,7) are walls.\nRow 2: #   A  # → (2,3) is A.\nRow 3: #    H # → (3,4) is H (head)\nRow 4: #  SSS # → (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) are S (body)\nRow 5: #  SS  # → (5,2), (5,3) are S\nRow 6: #  AS  # → (6,2) is A, (6,3) is S\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the head is at (3,4). The current direction is UP, so the next position if moving UP would be (2,4). Let's check what's there. Row 2 is \"#   A  #\", which is columns 0-7. Let's index columns 0 to 7:\n\nRow 2: columns 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is 'A', 4 is ' ', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So (2,4) is ' ' (empty). So moving UP would take the head to (2,4). Is that safe? Let's check for walls or body. (2,4) is within the board (rows 1-6 are non-wall), so no wall collision. Now, check if (2,4) is part of the snake's body. The body is in row 4: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4); row 5: (5,2), (5,3); row 6: (6,3). So (2,4) is not a body part. So moving UP is safe. But is there an apple there? No, (2,4) is empty. So moving UP would just move the head to (2,4), and the body would follow. The snake's length would stay the same unless it eats an apple.\n\nNow, let's consider other possible directions. The current direction is UP, so can't go DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check moving LEFT. The head is at (3,4). Moving LEFT would take it to (3,3). Let's check (3,3) in row 3: row 3 is \"#    H #\", which is columns 0-7. Column 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (3,3) is ' ' (empty). Is that part of the body? Let's check body positions. The body is in row 4: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) → (4,3) is S. Row 5: (5,2), (5,3) → (5,3) is S. Row 6: (6,3) → (6,3) is S. So (3,3) is not a body part. So moving LEFT is safe. No apple there either (since (3,3) is empty).\n\nMoving RIGHT: head at (3,4) → (3,5). Check row 3, column 5: row 3 is \"#    H #\", so column 5 is ' ', which is empty. Check body: body positions are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4); (5,2), (5,3); (6,3). (3,5) is not a body part, so safe. No apple there.\n\nNow, let's look for apples. The apples are at (1,1), (2,3), (6,2). Let's see where the snake can reach these apples.\n\nCurrent head position (3,4). Let's see the positions of apples:\n\n(1,1): top left area.\n\n(2,3): row 2, column 3.\n\n(6,2): row 6, column 2 (near the bottom).\n\nThe snake's body is in row 4 (columns 2-4), row 5 (columns 2-3), row 6 (column 3). So the body is forming a sort of vertical line from row 4, column 4 down to row 6, column 3. The head is at (3,4), which is above the body.\n\nIf the snake continues moving UP (current direction), next position is (2,4). Then, from (2,4), possible directions could be UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's see. (2,4) is in row 2. The apple at (2,3) is to the left (column 3). So from (2,4), moving LEFT would take to (2,3), which is the apple. That would be a good move. Let's check:\n\nCurrent move is UP → head moves to (2,4). Then, next move could be LEFT (since current direction is UP, next direction can't be DOWN, but can be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP). So moving LEFT from (2,4) would reach (2,3) (the apple), which would be eaten, increasing the score. That's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves LEFT now (from (3,4) to (3,3)), then the next positions would be (3,3). Then, maybe moving UP towards (2,3) (the apple there). Let's see: (3,3) is current head. Moving UP would take to (2,3), which is the apple. Oh! That's even better. Because if the snake moves LEFT now (to (3,3)), then next move (epoch 27) would be in direction LEFT? Wait, no. The direction the player gives is for the current move. Let me clarify:\n\nThe current direction is UP. The player's input is the direction the snake will move in the next step (epoch 26's move). The snake's movement is determined by the direction input given. So the current direction is UP (the direction the snake is moving in epoch 26). Wait, the problem says: \"The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\"\n\nSo the current direction is the direction the snake is moving now. When the player gives a new direction, it must not be the reverse. So, if current direction is UP, the player can choose UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse). So the direction input is the direction the snake will move in the next step.\n\nSo in the current state (epoch 26), the snake is moving UP. The player must choose a direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) for the next move (epoch 27).\n\nSo, let's re-express:\n\nCurrent head position: (3,4). Current direction is UP (so if the player chooses UP, the head moves to (2,4)).\n\nIf the player chooses LEFT, the direction becomes LEFT (since the previous direction was UP, which is allowed, as LEFT is not reverse). So the head would move LEFT from (3,4) to (3,3).\n\nIf the player chooses RIGHT, direction becomes RIGHT, head moves to (3,5).\n\nNow, let's check each possible direction:\n\nOption 1: UP → new head at (2,4). What's there? Empty. Then, the snake's body will shift. The body segments follow the head. The previous head (3,4) becomes part of the body, and the last segment of the body (the tail) is removed unless the snake ate an apple. Since there's no apple here, the tail is removed. Let's track the body:\n\nOriginal body positions (from head to tail, since the snake's body is a sequence):\n\nThe head is at (3,4). The body starts after the head. Let's see:\n\nThe body in row 4: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) → (4,4) is adjacent to head (3,4), so (4,4) is the next segment. Then (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3). Wait, perhaps the body is a continuous line. Let's think of the snake's body as a chain. The head is at (3,4). The next segment (body) would be the position the head was in before moving. Let's reconstruct the snake's path.\n\nThe snake's movement: each time it moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the one in front. So the body is a sequence of positions the head has been in, minus the tail (unless the snake ate an apple, which adds a segment).\n\nCurrent body is S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 4: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nRow 5: (5,2), (5,3)\n\nRow 6: (6,3)\n\nSo total body segments: 6 S's. The snake's length is 1 (head) + 6 (body) = 7.\n\nIf the snake moves UP (to (2,4)), the new head is (2,4). The previous head (3,4) becomes a body segment. Then each body segment shifts: the next segment (old (4,4)) moves to (3,4), old (4,3) moves to (4,4), old (4,2) moves to (4,3), old (5,2) moves to (4,2), old (5,3) moves to (5,2), old (6,3) moves to (5,3). Then, since no apple was eaten, the tail (oldest segment) is removed. The tail was (6,3), which would be removed. So new body positions would be (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). So the S's would be in these positions. The new board would have H at (2,4), S's in (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3).\n\nOption 2: LEFT → new head at (3,3). Let's check if (3,3) is safe. (3,3) is in row 3, column 3. The current body positions are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3). (3,3) is not among them, so safe. Moving LEFT (from UP direction) is allowed. Then, the new head is (3,3). The previous head (3,4) becomes a body segment. The body shifts: (4,4) moves to (3,4), (4,3) moves to (4,4), (4,2) moves to (4,3), (5,2) moves to (4,2), (5,3) moves to (5,2), (6,3) moves to (5,3). Tail (6,3) is removed. New body positions: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). So the S's would be here. Now, (3,3) is the new head, which is empty.\n\nOption 3: RIGHT → new head at (3,5). Check (3,5): empty, not part of the body. Safe. Then body shifts as before, tail removed.\n\nNow, let's check for apples in the next possible positions. The apples are at (1,1), (2,3), (6,2). Let's see which direction can lead to eating an apple soon.\n\nIf we choose LEFT now (epoch 26's direction), moving to (3,3). Then, in the next move (epoch 27), the current direction would be LEFT (since the player's input was LEFT). The snake can't reverse, so from LEFT, possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. Let's see where (3,3) can go next. The apple at (2,3) is in row 2, column 3. So if the snake is at (3,3) (current head) and direction is LEFT, next move could be UP (since direction can be changed to UP, as LEFT's reverse is RIGHT, so allowed). So moving UP from (3,3) would take the head to (2,3), which is the apple. That's perfect! Because (2,3) is an 'A'. So in epoch 27, if the direction is UP (from LEFT direction, which is allowed), the head would move to (2,3), eat the apple, grow, and increase the score.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose UP now (epoch 26's direction), moving to (2,4). Then, in epoch 27, the current direction is UP. Possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. The apple at (2,3) is to the LEFT of (2,4). So if the player then chooses LEFT (direction LEFT from UP, allowed), the head moves to (2,3), which is the apple. That also works, but requires two moves (epoch 26: UP, epoch 27: LEFT).\n\nBut in the current decision (epoch 26), which direction gets us to the apple faster? Let's compare:\n\nIf we move LEFT in epoch 26: head at (3,3). Then, in epoch 27, direction can be UP (since current direction is LEFT, and UP is allowed). So moving UP from (3,3) to (2,3) (apple). That's one move after this.\n\nIf we move UP in epoch 26: head at (2,4). Then, in epoch 27, direction LEFT (allowed) to (2,3) (apple). Also one move after.\n\nSo both paths can reach the apple in two steps (epoch 26 and 27). But let's check if there are any obstacles. Let's see the body positions after moving LEFT in epoch 26. The new body would be (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). So (3,3) is the head. Then moving UP to (2,3) (apple). (2,3) is not part of the new body (since the body after epoch 26's move is (3,4), (4,4), etc.), so (2,3) is safe. Eating the apple would add a segment, so the tail isn't removed. The snake's length increases by 1.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP in epoch 26 to (2,4). The new body is (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). Then moving LEFT to (2,3) (apple). (2,3) is safe. So both paths are possible.\n\nAnother apple is at (6,2). Let's see how to reach that. The head is at (3,4). To get to (6,2), the snake would need to move down and left, but the current direction is UP, so moving down (reverse) is not allowed. So that apple is probably harder to reach in the near term.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is in row 1, column 1. To reach there, the snake would need to move up and left. But that's further away, and there's the apple at (2,3) which is closer.\n\nSo the best immediate target is the apple at (2,3). Let's check which direction (UP or LEFT in epoch 26) allows reaching that apple without collision.\n\nIf we choose LEFT in epoch 26, the head moves to (3,3). Then, moving UP (epoch 27 direction) to (2,3) (apple). That's safe.\n\nIf we choose UP in epoch 26, head moves to (2,4). Then moving LEFT (epoch 27 direction) to (2,3) (apple). Also safe.\n\nBut what about other possible collisions? Let's check the body positions after each move.\n\nAfter moving LEFT (epoch 26):\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nNew body segments (from head to tail): (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)\n\nSo (3,3) is head. Next move (epoch 27) direction UP: head moves to (2,3). Check if (2,3) is in the body. The body after epoch 26 is (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). (2,3) is not in these positions, so safe. Eating the apple here.\n\nAfter moving UP (epoch 26):\n\nNew head: (2,4)\n\nNew body segments: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)\n\nNext move (epoch 27) direction LEFT: head moves to (2,3). (2,3) is not in the body positions (3,4, etc.), so safe. Eating the apple here.\n\nSo both directions (UP and LEFT) in epoch 26 can lead to eating the apple in epoch 27. But which is better? Let's see if there's any other factor.\n\nWhat about the other apples? The apple at (6,2) is in row 6, column 2. Let's see the current body in row 6: (6,3) is S, and (6,2) is A. So (6,2) is adjacent to (6,3) (body). If the snake can reach (6,2), but that's probably after moving down. But since current direction is UP, moving down is reverse. So maybe not immediately.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is in row 1, column 1. The head would need to go up to row 1, then left. But that's a longer path.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the snake's current path and possible collisions. Let's check if moving RIGHT is a bad idea. If we move RIGHT (epoch 26 direction), head goes to (3,5). Then, the next positions would be (3,5), which is empty. But then, moving further right could lead to the wall (column 7 is a wall). So (3,5) → (3,6) (next move RIGHT) → (3,7) (wall, collision). So moving RIGHT might not be a good idea as it could lead to a wall soon. So RIGHT is probably not the best option.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT: Let's see if there's any immediate danger. If the snake moves UP to (2,4), then the next move LEFT to (2,3) (apple). That's safe. If the snake moves LEFT to (3,3), next move UP to (2,3) (apple). Also safe.\n\nBut let's check the current body's position. The body in row 4, column 4 is S. If the snake moves UP to (2,4), the new head is (2,4), and the body includes (3,4) (previous head). So (3,4) is now S. Then, moving LEFT to (2,3) (apple) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,3) (head), body includes (3,4) (previous head). Then moving UP to (2,3) (apple) is safe.\n\nBoth options seem safe. Which one is better? Maybe the direction that allows the snake to have more space. Let's think about the snake's position after eating the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,3), the snake's length increases. Let's imagine:\n\nCase 1: Epoch 26 direction UP → head (2,4). Epoch 27 direction LEFT → head (2,3) (apple). The snake's body would now include all previous segments plus the new head's previous position (2,4). So the body length increases by 1 (since apple is eaten). So the tail is not removed. So the body would be (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). Then the head is at (2,3).\n\nCase 2: Epoch 26 direction LEFT → head (3,3). Epoch 27 direction UP → head (2,3) (apple). The body would include (3,3) previous position (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). Then, since apple is eaten, the tail is not removed, so body becomes (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (3,3). Head at (2,3).\n\nIn both cases, the head ends up at (2,3) after two moves, having eaten the apple. So either direction in epoch 26 is acceptable. But perhaps the first move (epoch 26) direction LEFT is better because it's a shorter path. Wait, no, both take two moves. Alternatively, maybe the current direction is UP, so continuing UP is possible, but perhaps moving LEFT allows the snake to avoid potential future collisions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better option. Let's check if moving UP now would lead to a position where the next move is blocked. For example, after moving UP to (2,4), the next move LEFT to (2,3) (apple) is possible, but what if the body is in the way? No, because (2,3) is not part of the body.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the snake's body is in row 4, 5, 6. The head is in row 3. Moving UP takes the head into row 2, which is above the body, which is good (more space). Moving LEFT takes the head into column 3, which is to the left of the current head (column 4), but the body is in columns 2-4 in rows 4-6. So column 3 is part of the body in row 4, 5, 6, but the head is in row 3, column 3, which is above the body's column 3 (rows 4-6). So no collision.\n\nSo, between UP and LEFT, which is better? Since the problem requires choosing one direction, and both are safe and lead to an apple in the next step, perhaps either is acceptable. But perhaps the apple at (2,3) is more directly reachable by moving LEFT first.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the positions again. The head is at (3,4). The apple at (2,3) is at (row 2, column 3). The head's current position (3,4) to (2,3) is up one, left one. So the direction to reach (2,3) from (3,4) is UP-LEFT. Since the snake can't move diagonally, it has to move in one direction per step. So first move LEFT to (3,3), then UP to (2,3). Or first move UP to (2,4), then LEFT to (2,3). Both are two steps.\n\nIn terms of game strategy, the best move is to go towards the nearest apple. The apple at (2,3) is the closest. So either direction (UP then LEFT, or LEFT then UP) is fine. But since the current direction is UP, perhaps changing direction to LEFT is better to reach the apple faster. Wait, no, both take two steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving LEFT is better because if the snake continues UP, it might hit the top wall (row 0 is a wall). Row 2 is the current row if moving UP. The next row up would be row 1. So if the snake moves UP from (2,4) to (1,4), that's row 1, column 4. Then, row 1 has an apple at (1,1). But that's further away. So perhaps the apple at (2,3) is the best target.\n\nIn conclusion, moving LEFT now (epoch 26) allows the snake to reach the apple at (2,3) in the next move (epoch 27). Therefore, the best direction is LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#   A  #\n#    H #\n#  SSS #\n#  SS  #\n#  AS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,4) (row 3, column 4), and the current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (2,4). This position is empty (no apple, no body collision), but it does not directly lead to an apple in the next step. The apple at (2,3) is to the left of (2,4), requiring an additional LEFT move to reach.\n\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (3,3). This position is empty (no body collision). From (3,3), the next move can be UP to (2,3), which is occupied by an apple ('A'). This path allows the snake to eat the apple in the next epoch (epoch 27), increasing the score and growing the snake.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3,5). This position is empty, but it does not lead toward any nearby apples. Further rightward movement risks hitting the wall (column 7 is a wall), making this direction less optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is the best choice, as it positions the snake to reach the nearest apple at (2,3) in the next move, maximizing the score while avoiding collisions.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A     # → so column 1 has an 'A' at (1,1) (assuming rows and columns start at 0)\nRow 2: #   A  # → 'A' at (2,3)\nRow 3: #   HS # → 'H' (head) at (3,3), 'S' (body) at (3,4)\nRow 4: #  SSS # → 'S's at (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\nRow 5: #  SS  # → 'S's at (5,2), (5,3)\nRow 6: #  A   # → 'A' at (6,2)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. Let's track the snake's body. The head is at (3,3). Since the current direction is LEFT, the next move (if we don't change direction) would be to (3,2). But we can choose a new direction, as long as it's not the reverse. The current direction is LEFT, so the reverse would be RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (continue), but not RIGHT.\n\nFirst, let's check the current snake's body positions. Let's list all 'S' and 'H' positions.\n\nH is at (3,3). Then S's:\n\nRow 3: (3,4)\nRow 4: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\nRow 5: (5,2), (5,3)\n\nSo the snake's body segments are: (3,3) [head], (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). Wait, maybe I should list them in order. The snake's body is a sequence. Since the head is moving LEFT, the previous positions would be in the direction opposite to movement. Let's think: when moving LEFT, the head moves to (3,2) next. The current head is (3,3), and the body behind it is (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). Because the body follows the head. So the body positions are (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 3: #   HS # → H at (3,3), S at (3,4) → so the first body segment is (3,4). Then row 4: #  SSS # → (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So (4,4) is next, then (4,3), then (4,2). Then row 5: #  SS  # → (5,2), (5,3). So the body is in this order: (3,4) → (4,4) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (5,2) → (5,3). So the snake's length is 1 (head) + 6 (body) = 7.\n\nNow, the snake's next move direction can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since current direction is LEFT, reverse is RIGHT which is not allowed). Let's check each possible direction.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. Let's see where each possible direction would take the head next.\n\n1. Continue LEFT (current direction): next head position is (3,2). Let's check if that's a wall or body.\n\n(3,2) is within the board (rows 0-7, columns 0-7). The walls are the first and last rows\/columns. So (3,2) is in row 3, column 2. Let's check if that's a body part. The body parts are (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). (3,2) is not in these positions. So moving LEFT to (3,2) is safe. Also, check if there's an apple there. Looking at row 3: #   HS # → (3,2) is empty (since row 3 is \"#   HS #\", which is columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: H, 4: S, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #). So (3,2) is a space. So no apple here. The snake would move, and the tail would move (since no apple is eaten). So the new head is (3,2), and the body shifts: the previous head (3,3) becomes S, and the last body segment (5,3) is removed (since length remains same if no apple eaten).\n\n2. Direction UP: moving up from (3,3) → (2,3). Check if that's a wall. (2,3) is row 2, column 3. Row 2 is \"#   A  #\". So (2,3) is an 'A' (apple). So if the snake moves UP, the head goes to (2,3), which is an apple. Then, the snake eats the apple, grows by 1 (so tail doesn't move), and the score increases. Now, check if (2,3) is a body part. The body parts are (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). (2,3) is not in these, so safe. So moving UP would eat an apple, which is good. Also, direction change from LEFT to UP is allowed (not reverse).\n\n3. Direction DOWN: moving down from (3,3) → (4,3). Check (4,3). The current row 4 is \"#  SSS #\", so (4,3) is an 'S' (body part). So if the snake moves DOWN to (4,3), that's a collision with itself. So that's a game over. So direction DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT (safe, no apple) or UP (safe, apple). Direction DOWN is invalid (collision).\n\nSo between LEFT and UP. The best choice is to go UP, since it eats an apple, increasing the score and growing the snake. So the answer should be UP.\n\n\n########\n#A     #\n#   A  #\n#   HS #\n#  SSS #\n#  SS  #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\n- **Snake Head (H)**: Position (3,3) (row 3, column 3).\n- **Snake Body (S)**: Positions (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3).\n- **Apples (A)**: Positions (1,1), (2,3), (6,2).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (RIGHT is invalid).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT (Current Direction)**:  \n   Next head position: (3,2). This is a safe empty space (no wall or body collision), but no apple is present here. The snake will move without growing.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Next head position: (2,3). This position contains an apple ('A'). Moving here will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score. (2,3) is not occupied by the snake’s body, so no collision occurs.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Next head position: (4,3). This position is occupied by the snake’s body ('S'), causing a self-collision. This direction is invalid (game over).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is the best choice, as it allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and avoid collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position and direction.\n\nThe game board is 8x8 with walls as '#' around. Let's parse the board row by row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #A     # (so column 1 has an 'A' at position (1,1))\nRow 2: #   H  # (H is at (2,3) since spaces are 0-based, so row 2, column 3)\nRow 3: #   SS # (so positions (3,3) and (3,4) are 'S')\nRow 4: #  SSS # (positions (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) are 'S')\nRow 5: #  SSA # (positions (5,2), (5,3) are 'S', (5,5) is 'A')\nRow 6: #  A   # (position (6,2) is 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,3). The current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving upward. The snake can't reverse direction, so from UP, the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP. Wait, no: the problem says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is UP, the player can't choose DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's think about where the snake's next head position would be for each possible direction.\n\nCurrent head is at (2,3). Let's calculate next positions:\n\n- If direction is UP: next head is (1,3). Let's check what's there. Row 1 is \"#A     #\", so (1,3) is a space (since row 1's characters are index 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'). So (1,3) is empty. Then, the snake's body would follow. Since the current direction is UP, moving UP again. The snake's body is currently:\n\nThe head is at (2,3). The body is S's in the following positions (since the snake is moving UP, the body is behind the head):\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 3 has \"   SS \" → (3,3), (3,4) → these are body segments.\n\nRow 4 has \"  SSS \" → (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nRow 5 has \"  SSA \" → (5,2), (5,3).\n\nSo the snake's body is a chain. Let's list the positions in order (from head to tail). The head is (2,3). The next segment (since moving UP, the previous position would be (3,3) because when moving up, the head was at (3,3) before moving to (2,3) in the previous step). Then (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4), (3,4)? Wait, maybe I need to reconstruct the snake's body properly.\n\nAlternatively, the snake's body is a sequence. Let's think about the snake's movement. The snake moves one square at a time. Each time it moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the one in front. So the body is the previous positions of the head.\n\nThe current head is at (2,3). The direction is UP, so the previous head position (before the last move) was (3,3). Then, the next body segment is (3,3). Then the next segment would be (4,3) (since before that, the head was at (4,3)), then (4,2) (before that, head at (4,2)), then (5,2) (before that, head at (5,2)), then (5,3) (before that, head at (5,3)), then (4,4) (before that, head at (4,4)), then (3,4) (before that, head at (3,4))? Maybe I need to look at the S positions.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 2: (2,3) is H.\n\nRow 3: (3,3) and (3,4) are S.\n\nRow 4: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) are S.\n\nRow 5: (5,2), (5,3) are S.\n\nSo all S positions are:\n\n(3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3).\n\nThe snake's body is these S's. The head is (2,3). The snake's length is 1 (head) + 7 (S's) = 8? Because each S is a body segment. So the snake's body is 7 segments long, making total length 8.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the body follows. So the new body positions are the previous positions of the head and the body segments. For example, if the head moves up to (1,3), then the first body segment (the one that was just behind the head) would move to (2,3) (the old head position), the next body segment moves to (3,3) (the previous position of the first body), and so on. The tail (last body segment) would move forward, and if the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move (since the snake grows).\n\nBut first, we need to check if moving in a direction would cause a collision.\n\nLet's check each possible direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT; since DOWN is reverse of UP and not allowed).\n\n1. Direction UP: next head position is (1,3). What's at (1,3)? Let's check row 1: \"#A     #\". The characters are [0]'#', [1]'A', [2]' ', [3]' ', [4]' ', [5]' ', [6]' ', [7]'#'. So (1,3) is a space (empty). Now, check if (1,3) is a wall. The walls are the first and last rows (0 and 7), and first and last columns (0 and 7) in each row. (1,3) is row 1, column 3. Column 3 is not 0 or 7, row 1 is not 0 or 7, so not a wall. Then check if (1,3) is part of the snake's body. The current body positions are (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3). (1,3) is not in those positions, so no collision. So moving UP is safe.\n\n2. Direction LEFT: next head position is (2,2). Let's check (2,2). Row 2 is \"#   H  #\", so columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (2,2) is a space. Check if (2,2) is a wall: no. Check if it's part of the body. The body positions are (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3). (2,2) is not in those positions. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT: next head position is (2,4). Let's check (2,4). Row 2 is \"#   H  #\", so (2,4) is a space. Check walls: no. Check body positions. (2,4) is not in the current body positions. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nNow, we need to see if any of these directions lead to eating an apple. Apples are at positions:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: (1,1) → 'A'.\n\nRow 5: (5,5) → 'A' (row 5 is \"#  SSA #\", so (5,5) is 'A').\n\nRow 6: (6,2) → 'A' (row 6 is \"#  A   #\", (6,2) is 'A').\n\nSo apples are at (1,1), (5,5), (6,2).\n\nNow, let's check where the next head positions are for each direction:\n\n- UP: (1,3) → no apple here.\n\n- LEFT: (2,2) → no apple here.\n\n- RIGHT: (2,4) → no apple here.\n\nSo none of the immediate next moves will eat an apple. So the priority is to avoid collision in the next steps and move towards apples.\n\nLet's think about the next possible moves and possible future paths.\n\nCurrent head position (2,3), direction UP. Let's consider the possible directions and their next steps.\n\nIf we choose UP: next head (1,3). Then, the new direction is UP (since we chose UP). Then, the next possible directions would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't go DOWN). The next position after that would be (0,3), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'), so that's a collision. So moving UP again would hit the top wall in the next step. So choosing UP now would lead to a wall collision in the next move (epoch 29's next move would be epoch 30, which is (0,3), a wall). So that's bad.\n\nIf we choose LEFT: next head (2,2). Then, the direction becomes LEFT (since we turned left from UP). Now, the next possible directions can't be RIGHT (reverse). So possible directions would be LEFT, UP, DOWN. Wait, the direction after moving LEFT would be LEFT, so the next move can't be RIGHT. Let's check where (2,2) is. Then, the next move (epoch 29) would be moving LEFT again to (2,1). Let's check (2,1): row 2 is \"#   H  #\", (2,1) is a space. No collision. Then, next move (epoch 30) would be (2,0), which is a wall (column 0). So moving LEFT might hit the left wall if we keep going left. But maybe there's a path to apples. Let's see the apple positions. (1,1) is in row 1, column 1. If the snake is at (2,2) (after moving left), then moving up to (1,2) (direction UP) would be possible. (1,2) is a space. Then (1,1) is the apple. So from (1,2), moving left to (1,1) would eat the apple. So that's a possible path.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: next head (2,4). Then direction is RIGHT. Next possible directions can't be LEFT. Let's see where (2,4) is. Then, moving RIGHT again would go to (2,5). (2,5) is a space. Then (2,6) is a space. Then (2,7) is a wall. Alternatively, from (2,4), moving UP to (1,4). (1,4) is a space. Then (1,5) is a space. (1,5) is in row 1, which has \"#A     #\", so (1,5) is a space, but (1,1) is the apple. Alternatively, (5,5) is an apple. Let's see where (5,5) is. That's row 5, column 5. The snake's current body is in row 5, columns 2 and 3. So (5,5) is to the right of the body. If the snake can move down towards row 5, column 5, that's an apple.\n\nAlternatively, (6,2) is an apple. That's row 6, column 2. So if the snake moves down towards row 6, column 2, that's another apple.\n\nBut the current direction is UP, so moving down (direction DOWN) is not allowed in the current move. However, after moving in a direction (like LEFT or RIGHT), the next direction could be DOWN, as long as it's not the reverse of the current direction.\n\nWait, the direction can be changed as long as it's not a direct reverse. For example, if the current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT, but can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nSo let's think about the possible paths.\n\nFirst, moving UP now:\n\n- Epoch 28: move UP → head (1,3). Body shifts.\n\nEpoch 29: direction can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't be DOWN).\n\nIf direction is UP again: head (0,3) → wall → game over. So bad.\n\nIf direction is LEFT in epoch 29: head (1,2). Then epoch 30: possible directions (LEFT, UP, DOWN). If LEFT again, (1,1) → which is the apple at (1,1). Oh! (1,1) is an apple. So moving UP in epoch 28, then LEFT in epoch 29, then LEFT in epoch 30 would reach (1,1) and eat the apple. Let's check:\n\nEpoch 28 (current): head (2,3), direction UP.\n\nEpoch 28 move: direction UP → new head (1,3). Now, direction is UP.\n\nEpoch 29: possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf in epoch 29, direction is LEFT → new head (1,2). Direction is LEFT.\n\nEpoch 30: possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN (can't be RIGHT).\n\nIf direction is LEFT → new head (1,1), which is the apple. Then, the snake eats the apple, grows, and score increases. That's a good path.\n\nBut in the current step (epoch 28), we need to choose a direction. Let's check if moving UP in epoch 28 is possible and safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT in epoch 28:\n\nEpoch 28: direction LEFT → head (2,2). Then direction is LEFT.\n\nEpoch 29: possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nIf direction is UP → head (1,2). Then epoch 30: direction LEFT → (1,1) (apple). Same as the previous path.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP in epoch 28 allows reaching the apple in epoch 30. Let's confirm the positions.\n\nAnother apple is at (6,2). That's row 6, column 2. The snake's current body is in row 5, column 2. So (5,2) is a body segment. If the snake moves down towards (6,2), but the current direction is UP, so moving down (DOWN) is not allowed now. However, if the snake changes direction to RIGHT or LEFT, then in the next steps, it can move down.\n\nThe third apple is at (5,5). That's row 5, column 5. Let's see where that is. The snake's body in row 5 is (5,2) and (5,3). So (5,5) is two columns to the right of (5,3). So if the snake can move right towards (5,5), that's another apple.\n\nBut let's focus on the immediate next moves. The snake must avoid collision.\n\nNow, let's check for each possible direction in epoch 28 (current step):\n\n- UP: next head (1,3). Safe.\n\n- LEFT: next head (2,2). Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: next head (2,4). Safe.\n\nWhich direction is best? Let's see possible future steps.\n\nIf we move UP (epoch 28 → (1,3)), then in epoch 29, possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. If we go LEFT (epoch 29 → (1,2)), then epoch 30 LEFT → (1,1) (apple). That's a good path.\n\nIf we move LEFT (epoch 28 → (2,2)), then epoch 29 could go UP → (1,2), then epoch 30 LEFT → (1,1) (apple). Same result.\n\nIf we move RIGHT (epoch 28 → (2,4)), then where can we go next? Epoch 29 direction could be UP, RIGHT, or DOWN. Let's see:\n\nEpoch 28: move RIGHT → (2,4).\n\nEpoch 29: direction UP → (1,4). Then, moving towards (1,5), (1,6), but no apple there. Or direction RIGHT → (2,5), then (2,6), (2,7) (wall). Or direction DOWN → (3,4). (3,4) is part of the current body (row 3, column 4 is 'S'). So (3,4) is a body segment. So if the snake's head moves to (3,4) in epoch 29 (if direction is DOWN from (2,4)), that's a collision with the body. So that's bad. So moving RIGHT now could lead to collision if we go down.\n\nSo moving RIGHT might be riskier. Because (3,4) is a body segment, and if we move down from (2,4) to (3,4), that's a collision. So direction DOWN from (2,4) (epoch 29) would hit the body. So perhaps moving RIGHT is not the best option.\n\nMoving UP or LEFT seems better. Let's compare moving UP and LEFT.\n\nIf we move UP to (1,3), then the next direction (epoch 29) can be LEFT to (1,2), then LEFT to (1,1) (apple). That's two steps to reach the apple.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (2,2), then next direction (epoch 29) can be UP to (1,2), then LEFT to (1,1). Also two steps. So both paths are possible.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP is better because the current direction is UP, so moving UP continues the current direction, which might be more straightforward. Alternatively, moving LEFT could also work.\n\nBut wait, when the snake moves, the body follows. Let's make sure that moving in a direction doesn't cause the head to hit the body in the next steps.\n\nLet's take moving UP first. After moving UP, the new head is (1,3). The body segments will shift. The previous head (2,3) becomes the first body segment. Then the rest of the body follows. So the new body positions would be (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3). Because the snake's length is 8 (head + 7 body segments), so when moving, the tail (last body segment) would stay if the snake doesn't eat an apple. Wait, no: when the snake moves without eating an apple, the tail moves forward (i.e., the last segment is removed). Because the snake's length remains the same. Each move, the head moves forward, and each body segment takes the position of the one in front, so the tail is removed. Only when the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move (so the length increases by 1).\n\nSo the current snake length is 8 (H + 7 S's). So when moving, if no apple is eaten, the snake's length remains 8. So the new body after moving would be the previous head position (2,3) and the first 6 body segments (since 7 body segments, the last one is dropped).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the snake as a list of coordinates, with the head at the front. Let's list the snake's coordinates in order (head first, then body segments):\n\nCurrent head: (2,3).\n\nThe body segments are the positions that the head has previously occupied, in order. Since the snake is moving UP, the previous positions (from most recent to oldest) would be:\n\n(3,3) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (5,2) → (5,3) → (4,4) → (3,4). Let's check the board:\n\n- (3,3) is S (row 3, column 3).\n\n- (3,4) is S (row 3, column 4).\n\n- (4,2) is S (row 4, column 2).\n\n- (4,3) is S (row 4, column 3).\n\n- (4,4) is S (row 4, column 4).\n\n- (5,2) is S (row 5, column 2).\n\n- (5,3) is S (row 5, column 3).\n\nSo the snake's body list (from head to tail) is:\n\nHead: (2,3)\n\nBody segments (in order): (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4), (3,4).\n\nSo the full snake is [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4), (3,4)].\n\nLength is 8.\n\nWhen the snake moves in a direction, the new head is computed, and the new body is the previous head followed by all body segments except the last one (since the tail moves forward when not eating an apple).\n\nSo for example, if moving UP:\n\nNew head = (2-1, 3) = (1,3).\n\nNew body = [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4) ].\n\nSo the new snake is [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4)].\n\nLength remains 8 (since no apple eaten).\n\nNow, check if the new head (1,3) is in the new body. The new body segments are (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4). (1,3) is not in there, so no collision.\n\nIf moving LEFT:\n\nNew head = (2, 3-1) = (2,2).\n\nNew body = [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4) ].\n\nNew snake: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4)].\n\nCheck (2,2) in body? Body segments are (2,3), (3,3), etc. No, so safe.\n\nIf moving RIGHT:\n\nNew head = (2, 3+1) = (2,4).\n\nNew body = [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4) ].\n\nNew snake: [(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4)].\n\nCheck (2,4) in body? No, so safe.\n\nNow, considering future steps. Let's think about the apple at (1,1). To reach there, the snake's head needs to get to (1,1). Let's see the path from current head (2,3):\n\nIf moving UP to (1,3), then LEFT to (1,2), then LEFT to (1,1). That's three moves (epoch 28, 29, 30).\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (2,2), then UP to (1,2), then LEFT to (1,1). Also three moves.\n\nEither path works.\n\nAnother apple is at (6,2). Let's see how to reach that. The current head is (2,3). To get to (6,2), the snake would need to move down. But current direction is UP, so can't move down in epoch 28. But after moving LEFT or RIGHT, the direction could be changed to DOWN.\n\nFor example, if in epoch 28, direction is LEFT → (2,2). Then in epoch 29, direction is DOWN → (3,2). Check if (3,2) is part of the body. The current body (after epoch 28 move LEFT) is [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4)]. So (3,2) is not in the body. So safe. Then epoch 30: direction DOWN → (4,2). But (4,2) is part of the body (since in the body list after epoch 29, (4,2) is a body segment). So (4,2) would be a collision.\n\nHmm, (4,2) is in the body. So moving down to (4,2) would hit the body. So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, moving down from (3,2) (epoch 29) to (4,2) (epoch 30) is a collision. So that path is not safe.\n\nAnother apple at (5,5). Let's see. (5,5) is in row 5, column 5. To reach there, the snake would need to move right. For example, moving RIGHT in epoch 28 → (2,4). Then RIGHT in epoch 29 → (2,5). Then DOWN in epoch 30 → (3,5). Then DOWN → (4,5). Then DOWN → (5,5). That's a path. Let's check if those positions are safe.\n\nEpoch 28: RIGHT → (2,4). Body: [(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4)].\n\nEpoch 29: RIGHT → (2,5). Body: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)].\n\nCheck (2,5): not in body. Safe.\n\nEpoch 30: DOWN → (3,5). Check (3,5): row 3 is \"#   SS #\", (3,5) is a space (since row 3 has \"   SS \" → columns 3 and 4 are S, column 5 is ' '). So (3,5) is safe. Body after epoch 30: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2)].\n\nEpoch 31: DOWN → (4,5). Check (4,5): row 4 is \"#  SSS #\", columns 2-4 are S, column 5 is ' '. So (4,5) is safe. Body: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2)].\n\nEpoch 32: DOWN → (5,5). That's the apple. So that's a path to (5,5) in 5 moves.\n\nBut that's longer than the path to (1,1), which is 3 moves. So the closer apple is (1,1).\n\nSo the best option is to move towards (1,1). Between moving UP or LEFT in epoch 28, which is better?\n\nIf we move UP, then next move (epoch 29) can be LEFT to (1,2), then LEFT to (1,1) (apple). That's two more steps.\n\nIf we move LEFT, next move (epoch 29) can be UP to (1,2), then LEFT to (1,1). Also two steps.\n\nBut what about possible collisions in those steps?\n\nLet's check moving UP first:\n\nEpoch 28: move UP → (1,3). Safe.\n\nEpoch 29: move LEFT → (1,2). Check if (1,2) is in the body. The new body after epoch 28 is [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4)]. So (1,2) is not in the body. Safe.\n\nEpoch 30: move LEFT → (1,1). That's the apple. So that's good.\n\nNow, moving LEFT in epoch 28:\n\nEpoch 28: move LEFT → (2,2). Safe.\n\nEpoch 29: move UP → (1,2). Check body after epoch 28: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4)]. (1,2) is not in the body. Safe.\n\nEpoch 30: move LEFT → (1,1). Apple. Also good.\n\nSo both paths are valid. But which direction to choose now (epoch 28)?\n\nThe problem says to choose the direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) that is best. Since both UP and LEFT are possible, but perhaps moving UP is better because the current direction is UP, and moving UP doesn't require a turn, which might be safer. Alternatively, moving LEFT is also safe.\n\nWait, but when moving UP, the next position is (1,3). Then, in epoch 29, moving LEFT to (1,2) is allowed (since the current direction after epoch 28 is UP, so in epoch 29, the possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. So moving LEFT is allowed.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT in epoch 28 changes the direction to LEFT, so in epoch 29, possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. Moving UP is allowed.\n\nBoth are possible. But perhaps there's another factor: the snake's body positions. Let's check if moving UP or LEFT would bring the head closer to the body in the next steps.\n\nAfter moving UP to (1,3), the body is [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4)]. So the body is behind the head.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (2,2), the body is [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,4)]. So the body is to the right of the head.\n\nNo immediate collision risk in either case.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the other apples. The apple at (6,2) is in row 6, column 2. The snake's current body has (5,2) as a segment. So (5,2) is in row 5, column 2. To get to (6,2), the snake would need to move down from (5,2), but (5,2) is a body segment, so the head can't go there unless it's moving and the body shifts.\n\nBut that's probably further away.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT, either is safe, but perhaps moving UP is better. But wait, what's the current direction? The current direction is UP, so moving UP continues the current direction, which is allowed. So I think the best choice is to move UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#   H  #\n#   SS #\n#  SSS #\n#  SSA #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,3) (row 2, column 3), and the current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible directions for the next move are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN is invalid). \n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **UP**: The next head position would be (1,3). Checking the board, (1,3) is an empty space (not a wall or part of the snake's body). This move is safe. Moving UP keeps the snake aligned with its current direction and allows a potential path toward the apple at (1,1) in subsequent moves (e.g., UP → LEFT → LEFT to reach the apple).\n\n2. **LEFT**: The next head position would be (2,2). This is also an empty space (not a wall or body segment). While safe, moving LEFT changes the direction, and reaching the apple at (1,1) would require additional turns (e.g., LEFT → UP → LEFT), which is slightly less direct than the UP path.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: The next head position would be (2,4). This is safe, but moving RIGHT leads the snake away from the nearest apple (1,1) and toward the right edge of the board, increasing the risk of wall collision in future moves if not carefully controlled.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is the optimal choice as it keeps the snake on a direct path toward the nearest apple (1,1) while avoiding immediate risks. \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#A  H  #\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n#  SSS #\n#  S A #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the current epoch is 29. The snake is moving up. Let's first locate the snake's head (H) and its body (S) to determine possible moves and avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's map out the positions. The board is 8x8, with the top and bottom rows being all # (walls). Let's index rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7), and columns 0 (left) to 7 (right).\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #A  H  # → columns 1 is A, column 4 is H (since positions are 0-7, indexes 1: A, 4: H)\nRow 2: #   S  # → column 4 is S\nRow 3: #   SS # → columns 4 and 5 are S\nRow 4: #  SSS # → columns 3,4,5 are S\nRow 5: #  S A # → column 3 is S, column 5 is A\nRow 6: #  A   # → column 3 is A\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the head (H) is at (row 1, column 4). The current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving upward. Since the head is in row 1, moving UP would take it to row 0, which is a wall. Oh, right! Because row 0 is all #. So if the snake continues moving UP, the next position of the head would be row 0, column 4. That's a wall, which would cause a collision and the game ends. So moving UP is definitely bad.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is UP, so the opposite direction is DOWN. So the snake can't choose DOWN (since that's reversing). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP (but UP leads to wall). So the snake must turn either LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check the possible next positions for each direction:\n\nCurrent head position: (1,4). Let's note the direction options:\n\n- UP: (0,4) → wall → collision. Bad.\n- DOWN: (2,4) → current direction is UP, so can't reverse to DOWN. So invalid (snake can't reverse direction).\n- LEFT: (1,3) → check what's there. Let's see row 1: #A  H  #. Columns are 0: #, 1: A, 2: space, 3: space, 4: H, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So (1,3) is empty (space). So moving LEFT would take head to (1,3). Then we need to check if that's a body part. The body parts are:\n\nRow 2, column 4: S (so (2,4))\nRow 3, columns 4 and 5: (3,4), (3,5)\nRow 4, columns 3,4,5: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\nRow 5, column 3: (5,3)\n\nSo (1,3) is not a body part. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (1,5). Let's check row 1, column 5. The row 1 is #A  H  #. So column 5 is space (since after H (column4), column5 is space). So (1,5) is empty. Check if that's a body part. Body parts are as above. (1,5) is not a body part. So moving RIGHT is also safe.\n\nNow, the snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's check where the apples are. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 1, column 1: A (position (1,1))\nRow 5, column 5: A (position (5,5))\nRow 6, column 3: A (position (6,3))\n\nSo apples are at (1,1), (5,5), (6,3).\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT (to (1,3)), what's next? Let's think about the path. The snake's body is in rows 2-5. Let's see the direction after moving LEFT. The next direction would be LEFT, unless another turn is made, but the player can choose direction each step. But in this step, the direction is chosen. So moving LEFT now, then next step, the direction can be changed (as long as not reversing).\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT (to (1,5)), then next possible moves. Let's see if moving RIGHT gets closer to any apples.\n\nThe current head is at (1,4). Moving LEFT to (1,3): next to (1,3). The apple at (1,1) is two steps to the left (columns 1 vs 3). Moving LEFT would bring the head closer to (1,1).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1,5): then, from (1,5), possible directions could be RIGHT (but check if that's possible). Let's check if (1,6) is a wall? Row 1, column 6 is space (since row 1 is #A  H  #, which is # at 0, A at 1, spaces 2-3, H at 4, spaces 5-6, # at 7. So (1,6) is space. So moving RIGHT again could take the head to (1,6), but that's not near any apples. The apple at (5,5) is in row 5, column 5. So from (1,5), moving down (if direction is changed to DOWN) would approach (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now, the head is at (1,3). Then, the next direction could be LEFT again (to (1,2)), then LEFT again (to (1,1)) which is the apple. That would allow the snake to eat the apple at (1,1) in two steps. That's a good path.\n\nBut need to check if moving LEFT now is safe. The body is in lower rows, so (1,3) is not occupied by the body. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT: (1,5) is safe. Then, next direction could be DOWN (since current direction would be RIGHT, so can't reverse to LEFT. So directions allowed would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT. If direction is RIGHT, next step would be (1,6), which is safe. Then perhaps turn DOWN towards (5,5). But (5,5) is in row 5, column 5. The body is in row 5, column 3. So the path down from (1,5) would go through (2,5), (3,5) (which is part of the body, because row 3, column 5 is S. Oh! Let's check row 3: #   SS #. So columns 4 and 5 are S. So (3,5) is S. So if the snake moves RIGHT to (1,5), then direction DOWN would take head to (2,5). (2,5) is row 2, column 5. Row 2 is #   S  #, which is column 4 is S. So (2,5) is space. Then next step, direction DOWN again to (3,5) which is S (body). So that's a collision. So that path is dangerous.\n\nSo moving RIGHT might lead to a collision with the body in the next steps. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent body positions (S):\n\nRow 2: (2,4)\nRow 3: (3,4), (3,5)\nRow 4: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\nRow 5: (5,3)\n\nSo (3,5) is part of the body. So if the snake's head moves to (2,5) (from (1,5) moving DOWN), then next move DOWN would take it to (3,5), which is a body part. That's a collision. So moving RIGHT then DOWN could be bad.\n\nWhat about moving LEFT? Let's see:\n\nHead moves LEFT to (1,3). The body is in lower rows, so (1,3) is safe. Then, next direction could be LEFT again, moving to (1,2). That's safe. Then LEFT again to (1,1), which is the apple. So in three steps (current step is moving LEFT, then next two steps LEFT), the snake can eat the apple at (1,1). That's a good plan.\n\nAlso, need to check if moving LEFT now (to (1,3)) would cause any immediate collision. The body is in (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3). So (1,3) is not among these, so it's safe.\n\nAnother thing to check: the snake's length. The initial length is 1, and each apple increases length. Let's count the body segments to know current length. The body is S's. Let's count the number of S's:\n\nRow 2: 1 S\nRow 3: 2 S's\nRow4: 3 S's\nRow5: 1 S\nTotal S's: 1+2+3+1=7. Since the head is H, the total length is 7 (body) + 1 (head) = 8. So the snake has eaten 7 apples (since starting length 1, each apple adds 1, so 8-1=7 apples eaten). But the problem states that the game starts with 3 apples. So perhaps new apples are generated when eaten? The example in the problem says that when you eat an apple, the next state has a new apple. So in the example, the initial board has 3 apples, then after eating one, the next board has 3 apples again (the example's initial board has 3 A's, and after eating, 3 A's again). So the apples are replenished when eaten. So the current board has 3 apples (A's) as per the given board.\n\nSo the current apples are at (1,1), (5,5), (6,3).\n\nSo moving LEFT towards (1,1) is a good target. Let's make sure that the direction change is allowed. Current direction is UP, so the possible directions are UP (invalid, wall), LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse). So the player can choose LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nSo the best option is to choose LEFT, to avoid the wall and move towards an apple.\n\n\n########\n#A  H  #\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n#  SSS #\n#  S A #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 1, column 4).\n- **Current Direction**: UP. Moving UP would take the head to row 0 (a wall), causing an immediate collision. Thus, UP is invalid.\n- **Reverse Direction Check**: The snake cannot reverse direction, so DOWN (opposite of UP) is also invalid.\n- **Possible Directions**: LEFT or RIGHT.\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,1), (5,5), and (6,3).\n\n### Analysis of LEFT and RIGHT:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (1,3). This position is empty (no walls or body segments). From (1,3), the snake can continue moving LEFT toward the apple at (1,1) (two steps away), which is a safe and direct path to an apple.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (1,5). This position is empty, but further movement toward the apple at (5,5) would require moving DOWN. However, row 3, column 5 is a body segment ('S'), so moving DOWN from (1,5) could lead to a collision with the body in subsequent steps.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the safest and most strategic direction, avoiding walls\/body collisions and moving toward an apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#A HS  #\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n#  SSS #\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 30. The snake can't reverse direction, so since it's moving LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed).\n\nFirst, let's locate the snake's head. The head is 'H'. Looking at the first row after the top wall (row 1, 0-based or 1-based? Let's assume rows are 0-7, with row 0 and 7 being walls. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (walls)\nRow 1: #A HS  # → positions 1-6 (since 0 and 7 are #). So positions 1: A, 2: space, 3: H, 4: S, 5: space. So H is at (1,3) if rows are 0-based (row 1, column 3). Let's confirm coordinates: rows are 0-7 (top to bottom), columns 0-7 (left to right). So each row's characters are from column 0 (left) to 7 (right). So for row 1: the characters are 0: #, 1: A, 2: space, 3: H, 4: S, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So H is at (row 1, column 3).\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, so the snake is moving left. The next position the head would move to if we continue LEFT is (row 1, column 2). Let's check that position. In row 1, column 2 is a space (from the board: \"#A HS  #\", so positions 1: A, 2: ' ', 3: H, 4: S). So moving LEFT would take H to (1,2), which is empty. But we need to check if that's a valid move (not hitting a wall or self). The walls are at column 0 and 7, row 0 and 7. So (1,2) is within the board (columns 1-6 are inside). The body parts are 'S's. Let's check if (1,2) is a body part. The body parts are in the board:\n\nRow 1: column 4 is S (H is at 3, so 4 is S, which is the body)\nRow 2: #   S  # → column 4 is S (row 2, column 4)\nRow 3: #   SS # → columns 4 and 5 are S (row 3, 4 and 5)\nRow 4: #  SSS # → columns 3,4,5 are S (row 4, 3,4,5)\nRow 5: #    A # → column 4 is A (no S here)\nRow 6: #  A   # → column 3 is A (no S here)\n\nSo (1,2) is a space, not a wall or body. So moving LEFT is possible. But maybe there's a better direction. Let's check possible directions:\n\nPossible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT (can't go RIGHT because current direction is LEFT, and reversing is not allowed).\n\nCurrent head position: (row 1, column 3). Let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT (current direction). Next position: (1, 3-1) = (1,2). What's there? Space. Safe. No apple here (row 1, column 2 is space). So snake moves, no growth. The body would follow. The tail would move if no apple is eaten. Since the snake's length is the number of H and S's. Let's count S and H: H is 1, S's in the board: row 1 column4 (1), row2 column4 (1), row3 columns4-5 (2), row4 columns3-5 (3). Total S's: 1+1+2+3=7. So total length is 8 (H + 7 S). So when moving, if no apple is eaten, the tail (the last S) would be removed. The new head is (1,2), then the body parts shift. The tail is the last S. Let's see the body segments. The snake's body is a sequence. Since the head is moving LEFT, the body follows. The current body is:\n\nH at (1,3) → next is (1,4) (S) → then (2,4) (S) → (3,4) (S) → (3,5) (S) → (4,3) (S) → (4,4) (S) → (4,5) (S). Wait, perhaps the snake's body is connected. Let's think about the snake's path. The snake is moving LEFT, so the head is at (1,3). The body behind the head (previous positions) would be (1,4), then (2,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)? Maybe I need to reconstruct the snake's body path. Let's think of the snake's movement history. Since current direction is LEFT, the previous move was LEFT. So the head was at (1,4) before moving to (1,3) (since moving LEFT from (1,4) to (1,3)). Then the body at (1,4) is the next segment. Then, before that, the head was at (2,4), moving up to (1,4), so the next body segment is (2,4). Then the head was at (3,4), moving up to (2,4), so next is (3,4). Then, perhaps the head was moving right from (3,5) to (3,4), so next is (3,5). Then from (4,5) to (3,5), so next is (4,5). Then (4,4) to (4,5), so (4,4). Then (4,3) to (4,4), so (4,3). So the body segments are (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3). So the tail is (4,3). If the snake moves LEFT (to (1,2)) and doesn't eat an apple, the tail (4,3) would be removed. The new body would be (1,3) (old head), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4). So the new board would have H at (1,2), S's at (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4). The tail (4,3) becomes a space.\n\n2. UP direction: Current head is (1,3). Moving UP would take it to (0,3). But row 0 is a wall (all #). So moving UP would hit the wall. Game over. So UP is invalid.\n\n3. DOWN direction: Head at (1,3). Moving DOWN would take it to (2,3). Let's check (2,3). The row 2 is \"#   S  #\", so columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: S, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So (2,3) is space. Is that a body part? The body parts are (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3). (2,3) is not a body part, so safe. Now, is there an apple at (2,3)? The apples are in row 1 (column1: A), row5 (column4: A), row6 (column3: A). So (2,3) is space. So moving DOWN would take head to (2,3), which is safe, no apple.\n\n4. What about other options? The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT. UP is invalid (wall). So only LEFT and DOWN are possible.\n\nNow, let's check if any of these directions lead to apples. Let's see where the apples are. The apples are at:\n\n- Row1, column1 (A) → (1,1)\n- Row5, column4 (A) → (5,4)\n- Row6, column3 (A) → (6,3)\n\nThe head is at (1,3). Let's see the possible next positions:\n\nIf moving LEFT (to (1,2)), next step's head would be (1,2). The next possible moves after that would depend on direction, but maybe there's a path to an apple. Let's think about the apple at (1,1). If the snake continues moving LEFT from (1,2), it would go to (1,1), which is an apple. That's good. Because (1,1) is A, so if the snake moves LEFT twice (current direction is LEFT, so next direction can be LEFT again, as long as not reversed). Let's check:\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. If we choose LEFT now, head moves to (1,2). Then, next epoch, direction could still be LEFT (since no reversal), moving to (1,1), which is the apple. Eating that apple would increase the score, and the snake would grow. So that's a good path.\n\nIf we choose DOWN now, head moves to (2,3). Then, what's next? The direction could be DOWN, LEFT, or UP (but can't reverse from DOWN to UP). Let's see, moving DOWN again would take to (3,3). Row3 is \"#   SS #\", so (3,3) is space (columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4:S, 5:S, 6: space, 7: #). So (3,3) is safe. Then (4,3): row4 is \"#  SSS #\", column3 is S (body part). Oh, (4,3) is part of the body (since the current body includes (4,3) as the tail). So if the snake moves DOWN to (2,3), then DOWN again to (3,3), then DOWN again to (4,3) would hit the body. So that's dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3), moving LEFT would take to (2,2). Then (2,1), etc. But maybe that's not leading to an apple quickly.\n\nThe apple at (1,1) is in the same row as the current head (row1). The head is at (1,3). To reach (1,1), the snake needs to move LEFT twice. Since current direction is LEFT, moving LEFT now (to (1,2)) and then LEFT again (to (1,1)) would get the apple. That's a direct path.\n\nSo the best direction is LEFT, as it leads towards the apple in the next step. Moving UP is invalid (wall). Moving DOWN doesn't lead to an apple immediately and might lead to a collision later. So the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#A HS  #\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n#  SSS #\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 1, column 3) (0-indexed rows and columns).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT (snake cannot reverse to RIGHT).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,1), (5,4), and (6,3).\n- **Walls**: Surround the board (row 0, row 7, column 0, column 7).\n- **Body Segments**: 'S' appears at (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (1,3) would take the head to (0,3), which is a wall. This causes an immediate collision and game over. **Invalid**.\n   \n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,3) would take the head to (2,3) (a safe, empty space). However, this direction does not lead toward any apple immediately. Further movement in this direction risks colliding with the snake’s own body (e.g., (4,3) is a body segment). **Suboptimal**.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1,3) takes the head to (1,2) (a safe, empty space). The next move (if direction remains LEFT) would take the head to (1,1), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple would increase the score and grow the snake. **Optimal**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is the safest and most strategic choice, as it directly leads toward an apple in the next step without risking collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' as walls. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #AHSS  # (so positions (1,1) is A, (1,2) H, (1,3) S, (1,4) S, rest spaces)\nRow 2: #   S  # (positions (2,3) is S)\nRow 3: #   SS # (positions (3,3) S, (3,4) S)\nRow 4: #   SS # (positions (4,3) S, (4,4) S)\nRow 5: #    A # (position (5,4) A)\nRow 6: #  A   # (position (6,2) A)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake's head is at (1,2) since row 1 has 'H' at column 2 (assuming columns are 0-indexed from left). Let's confirm the positions of the snake's body. The snake's head is H at (1,2). The next positions (since direction is LEFT, the body would be behind the head when moving left). Let's trace the snake's body:\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, so the snake is moving left (towards decreasing column numbers). The head is at (1,2). The body segments (S) should follow. Let's see row 1: after H at (1,2), the next is (1,3) S, (1,4) S. Then row 2 has (2,3) S. Row 3: (3,3) S, (3,4) S. Row 4: (4,3) S, (4,4) S. So the snake's body is a chain. Let's list all the snake's positions (head first, then body segments in order):\n\nHead (H): (1,2)\nBody segments (S):\n(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSo the snake's length is 1 (head) + 6 (body) = 7 segments. Because each S is a body part, and the head is H.\n\nNow, the snake is moving LEFT. So the next position the head would move to is (1,2-1) = (1,1). Let's check what's at (1,1). Looking at row 1: #AHSS  #, so (1,1) is 'A' (apple). So if the snake continues moving LEFT (current direction), the head will move to (1,1), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple would increase the score, and the snake would grow. \n\nBut wait, we need to check if moving LEFT is possible. The snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is LEFT. The possible directions the player can input are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. But the snake can't reverse direction. Reversing direction would be if the current direction is LEFT, then the opposite is RIGHT. So the player can't input RIGHT if current direction is LEFT (since that's a reverse). So allowed directions are LEFT (continue), UP, or DOWN. Because LEFT's opposite is RIGHT, so RIGHT is not allowed.\n\nSo possible directions to choose from are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nLet's analyze each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT (current direction):\nNext head position: (1,2-1) = (1,1). What's there? 'A' (apple). So the snake will eat the apple. Then, the snake grows. The body will follow. The previous head position (1,2) becomes S. The new head is (1,1). Since it's an apple, the snake doesn't lose a segment (because when you eat an apple, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; otherwise, when moving without eating, the tail moves forward, reducing the length by 1, but since the snake's length is maintained, the tail is removed). Wait, in snake games, when you eat food, the snake's length increases by 1, so the tail stays. Otherwise, when moving, the head moves, and the tail is removed (so length remains same). So in this case, if the head moves to an apple, the snake's length increases by 1, so the tail (the last S) remains.\n\nBut let's check if moving to (1,1) is safe. (1,1) is within the board (row 1, column 1: rows 0-7, columns 0-7). The walls are at the edges (row 0, row 7, column 0, column 7). So (1,1) is inside (columns 1 is not 0 or 7). So no wall collision. Also, is (1,1) part of the snake's body? The current body positions are (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4). (1,1) is not among them, so no self-collision. So moving LEFT is safe and will eat an apple. That's a good move.\n\n2. UP direction:\nCurrent direction is LEFT. UP is not the opposite (opposite of LEFT is RIGHT), so allowed. The head's current position is (1,2). Moving UP would take it to (0,2). But row 0 is all '#' (walls). So (0,2) is a wall. So moving UP would cause a collision with the wall. The game ends. So UP is invalid.\n\n3. DOWN direction:\nCurrent direction is LEFT. DOWN is allowed (not opposite). The head is at (1,2). Moving DOWN would take it to (2,2). Let's check (2,2). The row 2 is #   S  #. Columns are 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: S, 4: space, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So (2,2) is a space (not a wall, not a snake body). So (2,2) is safe. But is there an apple there? Let's check. The apples are at (1,1) (row 1, column 1), (5,4) (row 5, column 4), (6,2) (row 6, column 2). (2,2) is not an apple. So moving DOWN would just move the head to (2,2), and the tail would move (since no apple is eaten). The snake's length remains the same. But is (2,2) part of the snake's body? The current body positions are (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4). (2,2) is not in that list, so safe.\n\nBut the question is which direction is better. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible. So moving LEFT allows eating an apple, which is better. So the best choice is LEFT.\n\nWait, but let's confirm the head's position again. Let's make sure where the H is. The first row (row 1) is #AHSS  #. So the characters in row 1 are:\n\nIndex 0: # (column 0)\nIndex 1: A (column 1)\nIndex 2: H (column 2)\nIndex 3: S (column 3)\nIndex 4: S (column 4)\nIndex 5:  (space)\nIndex 6:  (space)\nIndex 7: # (column 7)\n\nYes, so H is at (1,2). So moving LEFT (column decreases by 1) would go to (1,1), which is A. Correct.\n\nSo the best direction is LEFT. Because it's safe, allows eating an apple, and the other options (UP leads to wall, DOWN leads to empty space) are worse.\n\n\n########\n#AHSS  #\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n#   SS #\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head (H) is at (row 1, column 2). The body segments (S) are at (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,1), (5,4), and (6,2).\n- **Walls**: Surround the board (rows 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT (Current Direction)**:  \n   The head moves to (1,1), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision) and will increase the score by 1. The snake grows in length.  \n\n2. **UP**:  \n   The head would move to (0,2), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   The head moves to (2,2), an empty space. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow. This is safe but less beneficial than eating an apple.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is the best choice, as it safely eats an apple and grows the snake.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#HSSS  #\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n#   SS #\n#    A #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, and the current epoch is 32. The snake is moving left, and we can't reverse direction, so we can't choose RIGHT. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since current is LEFT, reversing would be RIGHT, which is not allowed). Wait, wait, the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is LEFT, the opposite is RIGHT. So the possible new directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. Because reversing would be turning to the opposite direction, which is not allowed. So the player can choose UP, DOWN, or LEFT, but not RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's analyze the snake's position. The head is 'H'. Let's find where H is. Looking at the first row (since the first line is ########, which is the top wall). The second line is #HSSS  #. So row 1 (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top) is the first line (########), row 2 is #HSSS  #. So H is at row 1 (since 0 is the top wall, 1 is the next), column 1 (since columns are 0-indexed from left). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7)\nRow 1: #HSSS  # → columns 0 is '#', column 1 is 'H', column 2 'S', column 3 'S', column 4 'S', columns 5-6 ' ', column 7 '#'\nSo H is at (1,1). The snake's body is S's connected to H. Since the direction is LEFT, the snake was moving left, so the next head position would be (1,0) if we continue LEFT. But (1,0) is a wall (since row 1's column 0 is '#'), so moving LEFT would cause a collision with the wall, which ends the game. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP or DOWN. Let's check where moving UP or DOWN would take the head.\n\nCurrent head position is (1,1). Let's note the coordinates. Let's index rows from top (row 0 is top wall, row 1 is next, up to row 7 which is bottom wall). Columns 0 (left wall) to 7 (right wall).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, so the head is at (1,1). The body parts are in (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) (since row 1 is #HSSS  #, so H at 1,1; S at 1,2; 1,3; 1,4). Then row 2: #   S  # → S at (2,4). Row 3: #   SS # → S at (3,4) and (3,5). Row 4: #   SS # → S at (4,4) and (4,5). So the snake's body is a chain. Let's reconstruct the snake's path. Since the direction is LEFT, the head was moving left. So the previous positions would be:\n\nThe head was moving left, so the next position (if moving left) is (1,0), which is a wall. So moving left is bad.\n\nNow, possible directions: UP or DOWN. Let's check each.\n\nIf we choose UP: The head moves up from (1,1) to (0,1). But row 0 is the top wall (all '#'), so (0,1) is a wall. So moving UP would collide with the wall. That's a game over. So UP is invalid.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: The head moves down from (1,1) to (2,1). Let's check what's at (2,1). Row 2 is #   S  # → columns 0 is '#', column 1 is ' ', column 2 is ' ', column 3 is ' ', column 4 is 'S', columns 5-6 ' ', column 7 '#'. So (2,1) is a space (empty). So moving down to (2,1) is safe. Then, we need to check if that square is an apple. Are there any apples in (2,1)? Let's check the board:\n\nRow 5: #    A # → (5,4) is 'A'.\nRow 6: #  A  A# → (6,2) and (6,5) are 'A's.\nSo (2,1) is not an apple. So after moving down, the snake's head is at (2,1). The body will follow. Since the snake's length is the number of S and H. Let's count the current snake length. H is 1, S's: row 1 has 3 S's (columns 2-4), row 2 has 1 S (column 4), row 3 has 2 S's (4-5), row 4 has 2 S's (4-5). Total S's: 3+1+2+2=8. So total length is 8+1=9. When the snake moves, the tail (the last S) will move only if the snake doesn't eat an apple. Since (2,1) is not an apple, the tail will move. So the new head is (2,1), and the body segments shift. The previous head (1,1) becomes S, then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5) — but when moving, the tail (the last part) will be removed. Wait, the snake's movement: when moving, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So the tail (the last segment) is removed unless the snake eats an apple (then the tail stays, increasing length). Since moving down doesn't eat an apple, the tail is removed. So the new snake body would be H at (2,1), followed by (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,4) — and the previous tail at (4,5) is removed. So the new board would have S's in those positions. But regardless, the key is that moving down is safe.\n\nSo the only possible direction that doesn't cause collision is DOWN. Because LEFT leads to wall (row 1, column 0 is '#'), UP leads to wall (row 0, column 1 is '#'), and RIGHT is reversing direction (current direction is LEFT, so RIGHT is opposite, which is not allowed). So the only valid direction is DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#HSSS  #\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n#   SS #\n#    A #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so RIGHT is invalid. We need to check the other possible directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT) for collisions.\n\n- **LEFT**: The head is at (1,1) (row 1, column 1). Moving LEFT would take the head to (1,0), which is a wall ('#'). Collision with the wall, game over. Invalid.\n- **UP**: The head is at (1,1). Moving UP would take the head to (0,1), which is a wall ('#'). Collision with the wall, game over. Invalid.\n- **DOWN**: The head is at (1,1). Moving DOWN would take the head to (2,1). Checking (2,1) on the board: row 2 is \"#   S  #\", so (2,1) is an empty space (' '). No collision with walls or the snake's body. Safe.\n\nThe only valid direction that avoids collision is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#H  S  #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#    A #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, and we're at epoch 33. The snake can't reverse direction, so from DOWN, we can't go UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n\nFirst, let's map the snake's body. The head is 'H' in row 2 (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top). Let's list the positions:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SSSS  # → positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) are 'S'\nRow 2: #H  S  # → (2,1) is 'H', (2,5) is 'S'\nRow 3: #   SS # → (3,4), (3,5) are 'S'\nRow 4: #    S # → (4,5) is 'S'\nRow 5: #    A # → (5,5) is 'A'\nRow 6: #  A  A# → (6,2) and (6,5) are 'A'\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,1). Since the current direction is DOWN, the next position if moving DOWN would be (3,1). Let's check that position. Looking at row 3: #   SS #. So (3,1) is a space (since row 3 is columns 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is ' ', 4 is 'S', 5 is 'S'). So (3,1) is empty. That's safe.\n\nIf we turn LEFT, the direction would be LEFT. The head is at (2,1), moving left would take it to (2,0). But (2,0) is a wall (since row 2 starts with '#'), so that's a collision. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nIf we turn RIGHT, direction is RIGHT. The head is at (2,1), moving right would be (2,2). Let's check row 2: #H  S  # → (2,2) is ' ' (since H is at (2,1), then (2,2) is space, (2,3) is space, (2,4) is space, (2,5) is S). So (2,2) is empty. So moving RIGHT would be (2,2), which is safe.\n\nNow, what's the next position for each possible direction:\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (since can't reverse to UP).\n\n- DOWN: new head position (3,1). Check if that's a wall or body. (3,1) is ' ', so safe. Then, the body segments would shift. The snake's body would follow. The current body is S's. Let's see the snake's body structure. The snake's head is H at (2,1). The body is S's. Let's figure out the order of the body. Since the snake was moving DOWN, the previous positions would be behind. Let's reconstruct the snake's path.\n\nAssuming the snake was moving DOWN, the previous head position (epoch 32) would have been (1,1), because current head is (2,1) (row 2, column 1), moving down from row 1. Let's check row 1: #SSSS  #. So (1,1) is S. That makes sense: the head was at (1,1) in epoch 32, then moved down to (2,1) in epoch 33 (current), leaving (1,1) as S (body). Then, the body would be the previous positions. So the body segments are: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). Wait, maybe I need to track the snake's length. The initial length is 1. Each apple eaten increases length by 1. Let's see how many apples are left. The current board has 3 apples (row 5: (5,5); row 6: (6,2), (6,5)). So the snake's current length would be initial 1 plus number of apples eaten. Let's count the S's and H. The H is 1, S's: row 1 has 4, row 2 has 1, row 3 has 2, row 4 has 1. Total S's: 4+1+2+1=8. So total length is 1 (H) +8 (S) =9. So the snake has eaten 8 apples (since initial length 1, each apple adds 1, so 8 apples eaten, length 9).\n\nNow, when moving, the snake's head moves to a new position. If that position is an apple, the tail doesn't move (so the snake grows by 1). Otherwise, the tail moves (so the length remains the same).\n\nLet's check the next positions:\n\nOption 1: Move DOWN. New head position (3,1). What's there? (3,1) is ' ' (row 3: #   SS # → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4:S, 5:S). So no apple. So the snake's tail (the last S) would be removed. The tail is the oldest part. The current body is 8 S's. So after moving, the new body would be the previous positions except the tail. But the key is, moving DOWN is safe.\n\nOption 2: Move RIGHT. New head position (2,2). (2,2) is ' ' (row 2: #H  S  # → H is at (2,1), so (2,2) is ' '). No apple here. So safe.\n\nOption 3: Move LEFT. (2,0) is a wall (since the first character of row 2 is '#'). So collision, game over. So invalid.\n\nNow, what about the apples? The apples are at (5,5), (6,2), (6,5). The snake's head is at (2,1). Let's see the path to the apples. The current direction is DOWN, so moving DOWN would take the head to (3,1), then next steps: if continue moving down, (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). Then (6,1) is ' ' (row 6: #  A  A# → (6,1) is ' '). Then (6,2) is an apple. So moving down would eventually reach (6,2) in a few steps. Alternatively, moving right now to (2,2), then maybe (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) (but (2,5) is S, so that's body collision). So (2,5) is S. So moving right to (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), (3,4) (which is S). So that's a body. So moving right might lead into the body.\n\nAlternatively, moving down. Let's check (3,1) is safe. Then next direction could be down again, to (4,1). Row 4: #    S # → (4,1) is ' ' (since (4,5) is S). (4,1) is safe. Then (5,1) (row 5: #    A # → (5,1) is ' '). Then (6,1) (row 6: #  A  A# → (6,1) is ' '). Then (6,2) is A. So moving down would reach (6,2) in 4 steps (from current head (2,1) → (3,1) → (4,1) → (5,1) → (6,1) → (6,2)). So that's a path to an apple.\n\nIf we move right now, (2,2). Then next direction could be down. (2,2) → (3,2). Row 3: #   SS # → (3,2) is ' ' (columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4:S, 5:S). (3,2) is safe. Then (4,2). Row 4: #    S # → (4,2) is ' ' (since (4,5) is S). (4,2) is safe. (5,2). Row 5: #    A # → (5,2) is ' ' (since (5,5) is A). (5,2) is safe. (6,2) is A. So that's another path to (6,2) in 4 steps (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (4,2) → (5,2) → (6,2). Also 4 steps.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first. Let's see which path is better. The key is to avoid collision. Let's check if moving down is possible. The next position (3,1) is safe. What's the body positions? The current body includes (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). So (3,1) is not part of the body, so safe.\n\nIf we move down, then next direction can be down again. (3,1) → (4,1). (4,1) is ' ' (row 4: #    S # → (4,1) is ' '). Safe. Then (5,1) → (5,1) is ' ' (row5: #    A # → (5,1) is ' '). Then (6,1) → (6,1) is ' ' (row6: #  A  A# → (6,1) is ' '). Then (6,2) is A. So that's a clear path.\n\nIf we move right, (2,2). Then next direction could be down. (2,2) → (3,2). (3,2) is ' ', safe. (3,2) → (4,2). (4,2) is ' ', safe. (4,2) → (5,2). (5,2) is ' ', safe. (5,2) → (6,2) (A). That's also safe.\n\nBut perhaps moving down is better because the other options may lead into the body. Let's check other possibilities. What if moving down, then right? Let's see. But maybe the best is to go towards the nearest apple. The apples are at (5,5), (6,2), (6,5). The head is at (2,1). The distance to (6,2) is (6-2)=4 rows down, (2-1)=1 column right. So 5 steps. To (6,5): (6-2)=4 down, (5-1)=4 right. 8 steps. To (5,5): (5-2)=3 down, (5-1)=4 right. 7 steps. So (6,2) is the closest.\n\nSo the best path is to move towards (6,2). Since current direction is DOWN, moving down is possible. Let's check if moving down now would allow us to reach (6,2) without hitting the body. Yes. So moving DOWN is safe and leads towards the nearest apple. So the answer should be DOWN.\n\n\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#H  S  #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#    A #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 2, column 1) (0-indexed rows from top). The body 'S' occupies positions in rows 1-4 (detailed in the board).\n- **Current Direction**: The snake is moving DOWN. It cannot reverse to UP.\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 5, column 5), (row 6, column 2), and (row 6, column 5). The closest apple is at (row 6, column 2).\n- **Collision Risks**:\n  - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 2, column 0), which is a wall (row 2 starts with '#'), causing an immediate collision. **Invalid**.\n  - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 2, column 2), which is empty (' '). Safe, but this path leads away from the nearest apple (row 6, column 2) and may intersect the body later.\n  - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (row 3, column 1), which is empty (' '). This direction aligns with the current movement and leads directly toward the nearest apple (row 6, column 2) without body or wall collisions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is safe, maintains progress toward the nearest apple, and avoids collisions.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' as walls. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #SSSS  # (so positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) are 'S')\nRow 2: #S  S  # (positions (2,1) and (2,4) are 'S')\nRow 3: #H  SS # (positions (3,1) is 'H', (3,4), (3,5) are 'S')\nRow 4: #      # (empty)\nRow 5: #    A # (position (5,4) is 'A')\nRow 6: #  A  A# (positions (6,2) and (6,5) are 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, and the epoch is 34 (so we have 66 epochs left before the game ends automatically). The snake's head is at (3,1). Since the snake is moving DOWN, the next position the head would move to is (4,1) (since moving down increases the row number). Let's check if that's a valid move.\n\nFirst, check for walls. The rows go from 0 (top) to 7 (bottom). The head is at row 3, moving down to row 4. Row 4 is within the board (since 4 is between 1 and 6, as the walls are 0 and 7). So row 4, column 1 is (4,1). Let's check what's there. The row 4 is \"#      #\", which means all positions from column 1 to 6 are empty (spaces). So (4,1) is a space. So moving down to (4,1) is safe.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that moving in the current direction (DOWN) doesn't cause a collision with the snake's body. The current head is at (3,1). The body parts are at:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,4)\nRow 3: (3,4), (3,5)\nSo the body positions are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5). The next head position is (4,1). Is (4,1) in any of the body positions? No, because none of the body positions are in row 4. So moving down is safe.\n\nNow, are there any apples in the direction we can move towards? The apples are at (5,4), (6,2), (6,5). The current head is at (3,1). Let's think about possible directions. The snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is DOWN, so the snake can't reverse to UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since the current direction is DOWN, and the player can choose to keep moving in the same direction or turn to LEFT\/RIGHT, but not UP).\n\nWait, the rules say: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So reversing direction is not allowed. So if current direction is DOWN, the snake can't turn UP. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Current direction is DOWN. If we choose to keep moving DOWN, the next head position is (4,1). As checked before, that's a safe spot (no walls, no body). There's no apple there (since (4,1) is a space). So after moving, the snake's length remains the same (since no apple eaten), and the body will shift: the head moves to (4,1), and the tail (the last body part) will be removed if no apple is eaten. Wait, in snake games, when you move, the head moves forward, and each body segment follows the previous one. If you eat an apple, the tail doesn't get removed (so the length increases). If not, the tail is removed (so length stays the same). So in this case, moving to (4,1) (no apple), the snake's body will shift: the head is now at (4,1), the previous head (3,1) becomes body, and the tail (the last 'S' in the body) is removed.\n\nBut maybe there's a better direction to reach an apple. Let's see where the apples are. The apples are at (5,4), (6,2), (6,5). Let's see the positions:\n\nApple 1: (5,4) (row 5, column 4)\nApple 2: (6,2) (row 6, column 2)\nApple 3: (6,5) (row 6, column 5)\n\nThe head is at (3,1). Let's consider possible directions:\n\nOption 1: Move DOWN to (4,1). Then, next possible moves. From (4,1), if we continue moving DOWN, next position is (5,1). Let's check (5,1) in row 5: \"#    A #\". So (5,1) is a space, no apple. Then (6,1) would be next. Row 6: \"#  A  A#\". (6,1) is a space, (6,2) is an apple. So if the snake moves down to (4,1), then (5,1), then (6,1), then (6,2) (apple), that's a path. But that's a few steps.\n\nOption 2: Move RIGHT. Current head is (3,1). Moving RIGHT would take it to (3,2). Is that allowed? Current direction is DOWN, so moving RIGHT is allowed (not reversing). Let's check (3,2). The row 3 is \"#H  SS #\", so (3,2) is a space (since H is at (3,1), then (3,2) is a space, (3,3) is space, (3,4) is S, (3,5) is S). So (3,2) is safe. Then, moving RIGHT, the head would be at (3,2). No apple there, but then maybe next steps.\n\nOption 3: Move LEFT. Current head is (3,1). Moving LEFT would take it to (3,0), which is a wall (since column 0 is part of the wall). So moving LEFT is invalid (collision with wall). So LEFT is not possible.\n\nSo possible directions are DOWN and RIGHT. Let's check RIGHT:\n\nIf direction is RIGHT, head moves to (3,2). Check if (3,2) is a body part. The body parts are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5). (3,2) is not in these positions, so it's safe. Then, (3,2) is a space (no apple), so snake moves there, tail is removed.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,1). Let's see the next possible steps. Let's think about the snake's body. The current snake's body is a chain. Let's reconstruct the snake's path. The head is at (3,1). The body is S's connected. Let's see:\n\nRow 3: H is at (3,1). Then, row 2 has S at (2,1). So (2,1) is adjacent to (3,1) (since moving up from (3,1) would be (2,1)). So (2,1) is the next body segment. Then row 1 has S at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). So (1,1) is adjacent to (2,1) (up), then (1,2) is right of (1,1), (1,3) right of (1,2), (1,4) right of (1,3). Then row 2 has S at (2,4) (down from (1,4)), and row 3 has S at (3,4) (down from (2,4)), (3,5) (right of (3,4)). So the snake's body is arranged as:\n\nHead (3,1) → (2,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (2,4) → (3,4) → (3,5). So the snake's length is 9 (head + 8 body segments). Because the snake starts with length 1, each apple eaten increases length by 1. So the number of apples eaten so far is 8 (since 1 + 8 = 9).\n\nNow, the current apples are at (5,4), (6,2), (6,5). The snake needs to reach these apples without colliding.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (4,1):\n\n- New head position: (4,1). The body will shift. The new body segments will be:\n\nPrevious head (3,1) becomes body, then (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5). But since no apple is eaten, the tail (the last segment, (3,5)) is removed. So the new body would be (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). The new head is (4,1). So the snake's length remains 9 (since no apple eaten).\n\nNext move possibilities from (4,1):\n\nCurrent direction would still be DOWN (if we keep moving down). Next position would be (5,1). Let's check (5,1) in row 5: \"#    A #\". (5,1) is a space. Then (5,1) is safe. Then moving down to (6,1), which is in row 6: \"#  A  A#\". (6,1) is a space, (6,2) is an apple. So if we move down from (5,1) to (6,1), then right to (6,2), that's an apple. But need to check if that path is possible.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,1), maybe turn right. Let's say after moving down to (4,1), the next direction could be RIGHT. Then the head moves to (4,2). Check if that's safe. (4,2) is in row 4, which is empty. Then (4,3), etc. But perhaps that's not the quickest path.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves RIGHT from current position (3,1) to (3,2):\n\nHead moves to (3,2). Body shifts: previous head (3,1) becomes body, then (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5). Tail (3,5) is removed (since no apple). So new body is (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). Head at (3,2). Now, possible next moves: direction could be RIGHT again (to (3,3)), or DOWN (to (4,2)), or UP (but can't reverse from current direction, which after moving RIGHT would be RIGHT? Wait, no: the direction is chosen each step. Wait, the current direction is the direction the snake is moving. So when the player provides a direction input, that's the new direction, as long as it's not a reverse. So when the current direction is DOWN, the player can choose to change direction to RIGHT (since RIGHT is not reverse of DOWN), and then the snake moves in that direction. So the direction is the direction chosen by the player, provided it's allowed.\n\nSo, if the player chooses to move RIGHT now (current direction is DOWN, so RIGHT is allowed), the head moves to (3,2). Then, in the next step, the current direction would be RIGHT, so possible directions would be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (can't reverse to LEFT).\n\nBut back to the current decision. The goal is to eat apples. Let's see which direction leads to an apple soonest.\n\nThe apple at (6,2) is in row 6, column 2. The head is at (3,1). To reach (6,2), the snake would need to move down (rows 4,5,6) and right (column 2). So from (3,1), moving down to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), then right to (6,2). That's 3 moves down, then 1 right.\n\nAnother apple at (5,4): (5,4) is row 5, column 4. The head is at (3,1). To get there, need to move down 2 rows (to row 5) and right 3 columns (from column 1 to 4). So possible path: down to (4,1), right to (4,2), right to (4,3), right to (4,4), down to (5,4). That's 1 down, 3 right, 1 down.\n\nApple at (6,5): (6,5) is row 6, column 5. Head at (3,1). Need to move down 3 rows, right 4 columns. That's a longer path.\n\nThe closest apple seems to be (6,2). Let's see the path:\n\nCurrent head (3,1) → move down to (4,1) (row 4, col 1) → move down to (5,1) (row5, col1) → move down to (6,1) (row6, col1) → move right to (6,2) (apple). That's 3 moves down, then 1 right. All these positions are currently empty (since row 4,5,6 in columns 1-2 are spaces). So if the snake continues moving down, it can reach (6,1) in 3 steps, then right to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nIf the snake moves right now, to (3,2), then the next positions would be (3,3), (3,4). But (3,4) is currently a body part (from the original board: row 3 is \"#H  SS #\", so (3,4) is 'S'). So if the snake moves right to (3,2), then (3,3), then (3,4), that's a collision with the body (since (3,4) is part of the current body). So that's dangerous. So moving right now could lead to a collision if not careful.\n\nAlternatively, after moving right to (3,2), the next direction could be down. Then head moves to (4,2). That's safe (row 4, column 2 is empty). Then (5,2), (6,2) (apple). That's a path: (3,1) → RIGHT → (3,2) → DOWN → (4,2) → DOWN → (5,2) → DOWN → (6,2) (apple). That's 3 steps (right, down, down, down). But the path via moving down first is (3,1) → DOWN → (4,1) → DOWN → (5,1) → DOWN → (6,1) → RIGHT → (6,2). That's 4 steps. The other path via right then down is 4 steps as well (right, down three times). So similar.\n\nBut need to check if any of these paths have body segments in the way. Let's check the path moving down first:\n\n(4,1): empty. (5,1): row 5 is \"#    A #\", column 1 is space. (6,1): row 6 is \"#  A  A#\", column 1 is space. Then (6,2) is apple. So no body parts in these positions. So that path is safe.\n\nThe path moving right first: (3,2) is safe (empty). (4,2) is empty. (5,2) is row 5, column 2: \"#    A #\" → column 2 is space. (6,2) is apple. Also safe.\n\nBut what about the current body? The current body after moving down once (to (4,1)) would have the body segments shifted. Let's see: original body is (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5). When the head moves down to (4,1), the new body segments would be (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). The tail (3,5) is removed. So (3,5) is no longer part of the body. So moving to (4,1) is safe.\n\nIf the snake moves right to (3,2), the new body would be (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). So (3,2) is safe, (3,3) is next. (3,3) is empty (original row 3: \"#H  SS #\", so (3,3) is space). Then moving right to (3,3) would be safe, but (3,4) is part of the body (since (3,4) is in the new body segments). So (3,4) is 'S' again. So moving to (3,4) would collide with the body. So that's a problem. So if the snake turns right, then continues right, it would hit (3,4) which is body. So better to avoid that.\n\nSo the safest path is to continue moving down. Because moving down leads to empty spaces, and eventually to the apple at (6,2) without hitting the body.\n\nSo the best direction to choose now is DOWN. Because moving down is safe, and continues the path towards the nearest apple.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#S  S  #\n#H  SS #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head is at (3,1) (row 3, column 1).\n- Current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP. Possible directions: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- LEFT would move the head to (3,0), which is a wall (invalid).\n- RIGHT would move the head to (3,2). This is a safe empty space but does not lead directly to an apple and risks future collisions with the body (e.g., (3,4) is part of the current body).\n- DOWN moves the head to (4,1). This is a safe empty space (no walls or body collisions) and aligns with a path toward the nearest apple at (6,2). Continuing DOWN from (4,1) leads to (5,1) and (6,1) (both empty), then a right turn to (6,2) (apple).\n\nThus, moving DOWN is the safest and most strategic choice to reach an apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board.\n\nThe board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S'. The current direction is DOWN, and we need to choose the next direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN), but can't reverse direction. Since current direction is DOWN, reversing would be UP, so we can't choose UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since DOWN is the current direction, continuing is allowed).\n\nLet's parse the board row by row. The rows are from top to bottom. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SSSS  # → columns 1-4 are S, columns 5-6 are spaces, column 7 is #\nRow 2: #S  S  # → column 1: S, column 4: S, others spaces (except walls)\nRow 3: #S  S  # → same as row 2, column 1 and 4 are S\nRow 4: #H     # → column 1 is H, rest spaces (columns 2-6)\nRow 5: #    A # → column 5 is A\nRow 6: #  A  A# → columns 3 and 5 are A\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the head (H) is at row 4, column 1. Because rows are 0-indexed from top. So H is at (4,1) coordinates (row, column). The current direction is DOWN, so the next move (if direction remains DOWN) would be to row 5, column 1. Let's check that position.\n\nRow 5, column 1: the row 5 is \"#    A #\", so columns are 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: space, 5: A, 6: space, 7: #. So (5,1) is a space. So moving DOWN would take H to (5,1), which is safe (not wall, not body). Then, the snake's body would follow. Since the snake is moving, the tail (the last S) would be removed unless it ate an apple. But in this case, (5,1) is a space, so no apple eaten. So the snake moves, H to (5,1), and the body parts shift.\n\nBut maybe there's a better direction. Let's check possible directions:\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. Possible directions (can't reverse to UP). So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. DOWN: next position is (5,1). What's there? Space. Safe. Then, after moving, the head is (5,1). The body would be the previous positions. The current body parts: let's see where the S's are. The snake's body is in row 1 (columns 1-4), row 2 (1 and 4), row 3 (1 and 4), row 4 (H is at 1, so previous positions of the body would be the path leading to H). The snake's body is a bit complex. Let's try to track the snake's path.\n\nH is at (4,1). Let's think: the snake's body is S's. The direction was DOWN, so the previous head position (epoch 34) would have been (3,1), because moving DOWN from (3,1) to (4,1) (current H). So the body at (3,1) is now S. Then, before that, the head was at (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). Let's see:\n\nRow 1 (index 1): #SSSS  # → columns 1-4: S, S, S, S. So (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) are S.\n\nRow 2 (index 2): #S  S  # → (2,1) and (2,4) are S.\n\nRow 3 (index 3): #S  S  # → (3,1) and (3,4) are S.\n\nRow 4 (index 4): #H     # → (4,1) is H.\n\nSo the snake's body is a long one. Let's reconstruct the path. The head is at (4,1). The previous position (when moving down) was (3,1) (since direction was down, so previous head was (3,1) → now S). Then, before that, the head was at (2,1) → now S. Then (1,1) → S, then (1,2) → S, (1,3) → S, (1,4) → S. Then, from (1,4), the snake must have moved down to (2,4) (since (2,4) is S). Then (3,4) is S, so the snake went from (2,4) down to (3,4), then perhaps changed direction? Because (3,4) is S, (2,4) is S, (1,4) is S, then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). So the snake's body is like a U-shape. Let's confirm the positions:\n\nThe snake's body segments in order (from head to tail):\n\nHead: (4,1)\n\nThen (3,1) [previous head position]\n\nThen (2,1) [before that]\n\nThen (1,1)\n\nThen (1,2)\n\nThen (1,3)\n\nThen (1,4)\n\nThen (2,4)\n\nThen (3,4) → tail? Because (3,4) is S, and (2,4) is S, (1,4) is S. So the snake's body is in that path.\n\nSo the body positions are: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). That's 8 body segments, so the snake's length is 9 (head + 8 body).\n\nNow, possible next moves:\n\nOption 1: Continue DOWN. New head position (5,1). Check if (5,1) is safe. (5,1) is in row 5, column 1. The row 5 is \"#    A #\", so column 1 is space. So no collision. Then, the new body positions would be the previous head (4,1) becomes S, (3,1) becomes S, etc. The tail (3,4) would be removed unless the snake ate an apple. Since (5,1) is space, no apple eaten. So the tail (3,4) would disappear (since the snake moves forward, the tail is removed if no apple is eaten). So the new board's (3,4) would become space. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nOption 2: Turn LEFT. Current direction is DOWN, so turning LEFT is allowed (since LEFT is not the reverse of DOWN). The direction would change to LEFT. The head's next position would be (4,0) (since moving left from (4,1) → column 0). But column 0 is a wall (since the first character of each row is #). So (4,0) is a wall. Collision! So moving LEFT would hit the wall. That's a losing move. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nOption 3: Turn RIGHT. Current direction is DOWN, so turning RIGHT is allowed. Direction becomes RIGHT. The head's next position would be (4,2) (since moving right from (4,1) → column 2). Let's check (4,2): row 4 is \"#H     #\", so column 2 is space. So (4,2) is safe. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,2). Then, check if that's a body part. The body parts are (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). (4,2) is not in any of those positions, so safe. Then, the snake moves to (4,2). Since no apple there (row 4, column 2 is space), the tail (3,4) would be removed. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo possible directions are DOWN and RIGHT. Which one is better? Let's check the apples' positions. Apples are at:\n\nRow 5, column 5 (A) → (5,5)\n\nRow 6, column 3 (A) → (6,3)\n\nRow 6, column 5 (A) → (6,5)\n\nThe current head is at (4,1). Let's see where moving DOWN or RIGHT would lead towards apples.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (5,1), then next possible directions (since direction would now be DOWN again, unless we turn). From (5,1), the next moves could be DOWN (to (6,1)), LEFT (to (5,0) → wall), RIGHT (to (5,2)). Let's see (5,2) is space. (6,1) is row 6, column 1: row 6 is \"#  A  A#\", so column 1 is space. So moving down to (6,1) is safe. Then, from (6,1), possible directions (DOWN would be to row 7, column 1 → wall). So directions could be RIGHT. (6,1) → RIGHT to (6,2) (space), then (6,3) which is an apple. So that's a path to an apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (4,2). Then direction is RIGHT. Next move could be RIGHT again (to (4,3)), then (4,4), etc. Let's see (4,3) is space. (4,4) is space. Then (4,5) is space (row 4 is \"#H     #\", columns 5 and 6 are space). So from (4,2), moving right, the head could go towards (4,5), then down to (5,5) (which is an apple). That's a path to an apple as well.\n\nBut we need to check for possible collisions. Let's think about the body positions. Let's check if moving RIGHT to (4,2) is safe. The body is at (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). (4,2) is not in any of these, so safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,1) is also safe. So which direction to choose? Let's check if there's any immediate danger. For example, if moving RIGHT, the next positions may have body parts. Let's see. Suppose we move RIGHT to (4,2). The new body positions would be (4,1) (old head) becomes S, (3,1) becomes S, (2,1) becomes S, (1,1) becomes S, (1,2) becomes S, (1,3) becomes S, (1,4) becomes S, (2,4) becomes S. The tail (3,4) is removed, so (3,4) becomes space. So the new body after moving RIGHT would be (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4). The new head is (4,2). Are there any body parts in the next steps? Let's say next move (epoch 36) direction could be RIGHT again. Then head moves to (4,3). (4,3) is space, safe. Then (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (4,6) is row 4, column 6: space. Then (5,6) (if moving down). (5,6) is space (row 5 is \"#    A #\", column 6 is space). Then (6,6) is wall (row 6 is \"#  A  A#\", column 6 is #). So that's a wall. So need to avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN. After moving to (5,1), direction could be DOWN again (to (6,1)), then (6,1) is space. Then direction RIGHT to (6,2), (6,3) which is an apple. That's good. So (6,3) is an apple. So moving down, then right would reach an apple.\n\nBut let's check the current apple positions. The apples are at (5,5), (6,3), (6,5). So (6,3) is one of them. So if we go down to (5,1), then down to (6,1), then right to (6,2), then right to (6,3), which is an apple. That's 3 moves. Alternatively, moving right from (4,1) to (4,2), then right to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), then down to (5,5) (apple). That's 4 moves. So moving down might get to an apple faster.\n\nAnother thing: if we move RIGHT, the next position is (4,2). Is that possible to collide with body in the next steps? Let's see. The body after moving RIGHT would have (4,1) as S. So (4,1) is part of the body. If the snake is at (4,2), and then moves left (but direction can't reverse, so if current direction is RIGHT, next direction can't be LEFT. So possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN. So moving left is not allowed. So (4,2) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,1). The body after that would have (4,1) as S. (5,1) is safe, and next moves can proceed towards apples.\n\nSo which direction is better? Let's think about the snake's current path. The snake's body is in a sort of U-shape. The head is at (4,1), and the body goes up to (1,1), then right along row 1 to (1,4), then down to (3,4). So the left side (columns 1) is filled with body from row 1 to row 3, and row 1 columns 1-4 are body, row 2 and 3 columns 4 are body.\n\nIf we move RIGHT, the head goes to (4,2), which is in the same row as the head. Then, moving right would take the head into open space (row 4, columns 2-6 are empty). That's a good area with no body parts, so that's safe. Then, moving towards the apples in row 5 and 6.\n\nIf we move DOWN, the head goes to (5,1), which is row 5, column 1. Then, moving down to (6,1), which is row 6, column 1. Then, moving right towards (6,3) (apple). That's also a safe path.\n\nBut what about the walls? The snake is in row 4. The bottom wall is row 7. So row 5 and 6 are safe (rows 5 and 6 are within 0-7, so row 5 is index 5, row 6 index 6, row 7 is the bottom wall. So (5,1) is safe, (6,1) is safe, (7,1) is a wall.\n\nSo both directions (DOWN and RIGHT) are safe. Which one is better? Let's see if there's any possible collision in the next steps. For example, if moving RIGHT, the head is at (4,2). The body in row 1, column 2 is S. So (1,2) is S, but (4,2) is far from that, so no collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN, (5,1) is safe. So perhaps either direction is okay. But maybe the best is to go towards the nearest apple.\n\nThe apples are at (5,5), (6,3), (6,5). Let's calculate the distance from the current head (4,1) to each apple.\n\nDistance to (5,5): rows difference 1 (5-4=1), columns difference 4 (5-1=4). Total steps (assuming moving through grid) would be 1+4=5.\n\nDistance to (6,3): rows difference 2 (6-4=2), columns difference 2 (3-1=2). Total steps 4.\n\nDistance to (6,5): rows 2, columns 4. Steps 6.\n\nSo (6,3) is the closest. So the path towards (6,3) would be better. How to reach (6,3)?\n\nCurrent head (4,1). To reach (6,3), the snake can move down twice (to (5,1), (6,1)), then right twice (to (6,2), (6,3)). That's 4 steps, which matches the distance.\n\nSo if the snake moves DOWN now (current direction is DOWN), then next direction can be DOWN again (to (5,1)), then again DOWN (to (6,1)), then RIGHT (to (6,2)), then RIGHT (to (6,3)) which is the apple. So that's a good path.\n\nIf we choose to move RIGHT now, the head would go to (4,2). Then, moving right to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), then down to (5,5) (apple). That's 5 steps, which is longer than the path to (6,3).\n\nSo moving DOWN now would allow the snake to reach the closest apple (6,3) in fewer steps. So the best direction is to continue moving DOWN.\n\n\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#S  S  #\n#S  S  #\n#H     #\n#    A #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse to UP. We need to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (4,1) would take the head to (4,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall). This causes a collision, so LEFT is invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (4,1) would take the head to (4,2), a safe empty space (no walls or body parts). This is a valid option but leads the snake away from the nearest apple.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (4,1) takes the head to (5,1), a safe empty space. This direction aligns with the current movement and brings the snake closer to the nearest apple at (6,3) (rows 5 and 6, column 3).  \n\nThe closest apple is at (6,3). Continuing DOWN allows the snake to approach this apple efficiently (next steps: DOWN to (5,1), then DOWN to (6,1), then RIGHT to (6,2), and finally RIGHT to (6,3) to eat the apple).  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#S  S  #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#H   A #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, and the current epoch is 36. The snake's head is at position (5,1) if we consider rows from top (0) to bottom (7). Let's map the positions. The board has 8 rows. Let's index rows 0 to 7, columns 0 to 7 (since it's 8x8, walls are at the edges).\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SSSS  # → columns 1-4 are 'S', columns 5-6 are spaces, column 7 is '#'\nRow 2: #S  S  # → columns 1 is 'S', columns 2-3 are spaces, column 4 is 'S', columns 5-6 spaces, column 7 '#'\nRow 3: #S     # → column 1 'S', others (2-6) spaces, column 7 '#'\nRow 4: #S     # → column 1 'S', others spaces\nRow 5: #H   A # → column 1 is 'H', columns 2-3 spaces, column 4 'A', column 5-6 spaces, column 7 '#'\nRow 6: #  A  A# → column 1-2 spaces, column 3 'A', column 4-5 spaces, column 6 'A', column 7 '#'\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at row 5, column 1. Current direction is DOWN, which means the snake is moving downward. Let's confirm the direction: moving DOWN from row 5 would take the head to row 6. Let's check where that is.\n\nRow 5, column 1 is H. Moving DOWN (row increases by 1), next position is row 6, column 1. Let's look at row 6: #  A  A# → column 1 is a space (since the row is \"  A  A\" between the #s). So the next position (row 6, column 1) is a space. But wait, what's the snake's body? We need to check if moving there would hit the body.\n\nWait, the snake's body is the 'S's. Let's list all the 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1: columns 1,2,3,4 → (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\nRow 2: column 1 and 4 → (2,1), (2,4)\nRow 3: column 1 → (3,1)\nRow 4: column 1 → (4,1)\nRow 5: column 1 is H, so not S.\n\nSo the snake's body segments are:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (4,1)\n\nThe head is at (5,1). The current direction is DOWN, so the next head position would be (6,1). Let's check if (6,1) is a body part. Looking at the body positions, (6,1) is not in the list. So moving DOWN would take the head to (6,1), which is a space (not a wall, not body). Then, the snake would move. But wait, are there any apples in the next position? Let's check row 6, column 1: row 6 is \"#  A  A#\", so columns 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is space, 3 is A, 4 is space, 5 is space, 6 is A, 7 is #. So (6,1) is a space. So moving DOWN would not eat an apple. \n\nNow, the possible directions the player can choose are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. But the snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is DOWN, so reversing would be UP. So the player can't choose UP (since that's the reverse of DOWN). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nWait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, the example says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, no, the actual reversal is if current direction is UP, you can't go DOWN (reverse), and if current is LEFT, can't go RIGHT (reverse). So, for current direction DOWN, the reverse direction is UP. So the snake can't turn to UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n\nSo the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. Let's evaluate each option.\n\nOption 1: DOWN. Next head position (6,1). As above, that's a space. Then, the snake moves. The tail (the last body part) would move, but since the snake hasn't eaten an apple, the length remains the same, so the tail would be removed. Wait, the snake's movement: when moving, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So if the snake is moving and doesn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So the body would shift.\n\nBut we need to check if moving in any direction would cause collision. Let's check each possible direction.\n\nOption 2: LEFT. Current head is at (5,1). Moving LEFT would take it to (5,0). But (5,0) is a wall (since row 5 starts with #, column 0 is #). So moving LEFT would hit the wall. That's a collision, game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nOption 3: RIGHT. Current head is at (5,1). Moving RIGHT would take it to (5,2). Let's check (5,2). Row 5 is \"#H   A #\", so columns: 0 is #, 1 is H, 2 is space, 3 is space, 4 is A, 5 is space, 6 is space, 7 is #. So (5,2) is a space. Is that position part of the snake's body? The body positions are as listed before. (5,2) is not in the body list, so no collision. So moving RIGHT is possible. What's in (5,2)? It's a space, so no apple. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (5,2), which is safe.\n\nOption 4: DOWN (already considered). (6,1) is safe.\n\nNow, are there apples nearby that we should aim for? Let's look at the positions of apples. The apples are in row 5, column 4 (A), row 6, column 3 (A), row 6, column 6 (A).\n\nHead is at (5,1). Let's see possible paths to apples.\n\nIf current direction is DOWN, moving to (6,1). From there, possible next directions (since direction would now be DOWN, unless changed). Let's see the next steps.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose RIGHT now, head moves to (5,2). Then, possible directions (since current direction would be RIGHT, so can't reverse to LEFT). Let's see.\n\nBut perhaps the best move is to go towards the apples. Let's see the positions:\n\nThe apple at (5,4) is in row 5, column 4. The head is at (5,1). So to reach (5,4), the snake would need to move RIGHT three times (from (5,1) → (5,2) → (5,3) → (5,4)). That's possible if those positions are safe.\n\nCheck (5,3): row 5, column 3 is space. (5,4) is A. So moving RIGHT now (to (5,2)), then RIGHT again (to (5,3)), then RIGHT again (to (5,4)) would eat that apple.\n\nBut need to check if the path is clear. Let's check the body positions. The body is in (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (4,1). So (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) are all not body parts. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nIf we move DOWN now (to (6,1)), then the next possible direction could be RIGHT. Let's see (6,1) is row 6, column 1. From there, moving RIGHT would go to (6,2), which is space (row 6 is \"#  A  A#\" → columns 1: space, 2: space, 3: A). So (6,2) is space, (6,3) is A. So moving RIGHT from (6,1) to (6,2) then (6,3) would reach that apple.\n\nBut which path is better? Let's check if there are any body parts in the way for either path.\n\nIf moving RIGHT now: (5,2) is safe. Then next direction (if we choose RIGHT again) would be allowed (since current direction would be RIGHT, and can't reverse to LEFT). So (5,3) is safe. Then (5,4) is the apple. That's three steps to reach that apple.\n\nIf moving DOWN now: (6,1) is safe. Then, moving RIGHT to (6,2), then RIGHT to (6,3) (the apple there). That's two steps to reach an apple (since from (6,1) → (6,2) → (6,3) which is A). So that's faster.\n\nWait, row 6, column 3 is A. So (6,3) is an apple. Let's confirm: row 6 is \"#  A  A#\", which is columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: 'A', 7: '#'. So (6,3) is A. So if the snake moves DOWN to (6,1), then RIGHT to (6,2), then RIGHT to (6,3), that's an apple. So that's two moves after the current one.\n\nAlternatively, if we move RIGHT now, then next steps would be (5,2) → (5,3) → (5,4) (apple). That's three moves.\n\nBut let's think about the current possible directions. The current direction is DOWN, and the player can choose to continue DOWN, or turn LEFT (invalid), RIGHT (valid), or UP (invalid). So the options are DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nIf we choose DOWN, the next head position is (6,1). Is (6,1) a valid position? Let's confirm. The walls are at column 0 and 7, row 0 and 7. So (6,1) is within the board (row 6 is between 0 and 7, column 1 is between 0 and 7). So it's not a wall. And (6,1) is not part of the snake's body (body positions are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (4,1)), so (6,1) is safe.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT, head moves to (5,2). That's (row 5, column 2). Is that a wall? No. Is that part of the body? The body parts are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (4,1). (5,2) is not in that list, so it's safe.\n\nNow, which direction is better? Let's see if there's any immediate danger. For example, if moving DOWN, the next position is (6,1), which is safe. Then, from there, moving RIGHT towards (6,3) (apple) is possible. If moving RIGHT, (5,2) is safe, then moving RIGHT again to (5,3), then to (5,4) (apple).\n\nBut perhaps the best move is to go towards the nearest apple. Let's check the distance.\n\nThe apple at (5,4) is 3 units to the right of the head (from (5,1) to (5,4): columns 1→2→3→4).\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is 2 units down and 2 units right from the head (current head (5,1) → down to (6,1), then right twice to (6,3)).\n\nThe apple at (6,6) is further away (down 1, right 5).\n\nSo the closest apples are (5,4) and (6,3). Let's see if moving DOWN now gets us closer to (6,3).\n\nIf we move DOWN to (6,1), then the next move could be RIGHT to (6,2), then RIGHT to (6,3) (apple). That's two moves. So that's better than moving RIGHT now, which would take three moves to reach (5,4).\n\nBut we need to check if the path after moving DOWN is clear. Let's imagine the next step after moving DOWN. The new head is (6,1). The body would shift. The snake's body was:\n\nOriginal body (before moving):\n\nH is at (5,1). The body segments are the 'S's. Let's think of the snake's body as a list. The snake's length is the number of 'S's plus 1 (the head). Let's count the 'S's: row 1 has 4 S's, row 2 has 2 S's, row 3 has 1, row 4 has 1. Total S's: 4+2+1+1=8. So the snake's length is 8+1=9. So when moving, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. So the new body would be:\n\nAfter moving DOWN (head to (6,1)), the body would be:\n\nThe previous head (5,1) becomes S, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the body would now be:\n\n(5,1) (old head), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4). Because the original body was:\n\nOriginal S positions (from tail to head? Or head to tail? Hmm. The snake's movement: the head moves forward, and each body part follows the one in front. So the order of the body is such that the first body segment is right behind the head. Let's think: The head is at (5,1). What's the segment immediately behind it (since direction is DOWN, the previous direction was DOWN, so the body would be in (4,1), then (3,1), etc. Because the snake was moving DOWN. So the body segments in order (from head to tail) would be:\n\nHead: (5,1)\n\nBody1: (4,1) (since moving DOWN, the previous position of the head was (4,1), which is now body)\n\nBody2: (3,1) (previous position of Body1)\n\nBody3: (2,1) (previous position of Body2)\n\nBody4: (1,1) (previous position of Body3)\n\nBody5: (1,2) (since the snake must have turned here. Because after (1,1), the next body is (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), then (2,4). So the snake's path was:\n\n(1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (2,4). So those are the other body parts.\n\nSo when the head moves down to (6,1), the new body segments will be:\n\nHead: (6,1)\n\nBody1: (5,1) (old head)\n\nBody2: (4,1) (old Body1)\n\nBody3: (3,1) (old Body2)\n\nBody4: (2,1) (old Body3)\n\nBody5: (1,1) (old Body4)\n\nBody6: (1,2) (old Body5)\n\nBody7: (1,3) (old Body6)\n\nBody8: (1,4) (old Body7)\n\nBody9: (2,4) (old Body8)\n\nSo the new body positions after moving DOWN are:\n\n(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)\n\nSo (6,1) is the new head, and none of the body positions are (6,1), so that's safe.\n\nNow, if the next direction after moving DOWN is RIGHT, the head would move to (6,2). Let's check (6,2): it's a space, not a body part (since the body parts are the ones listed above). Then, moving RIGHT again to (6,3), which is an apple. So that would be a good move.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose RIGHT now (current move), the head moves to (5,2). Let's check the body after that. The body would be:\n\nHead: (5,2)\n\nBody1: (5,1) (old head)\n\nBody2: (4,1) (old Body1)\n\nBody3: (3,1) (old Body2)\n\nBody4: (2,1) (old Body3)\n\nBody5: (1,1) (old Body4)\n\nBody6: (1,2) (old Body5)\n\nBody7: (1,3) (old Body6)\n\nBody8: (1,4) (old Body7)\n\nBody9: (2,4) (old Body8)\n\nSo (5,2) is safe. Then, next direction could be RIGHT again (since current direction would be RIGHT, can't go LEFT). So (5,3) is next. Then (5,4) which is an apple.\n\nBut the question is, which direction (DOWN or RIGHT) is better. Let's check if there's any possible collision in either path.\n\nIf we move DOWN now, (6,1) is safe. Then, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe. Then, moving RIGHT to (6,3) (apple) is safe. That's a valid path.\n\nIf we move RIGHT now, (5,2) is safe. Then, moving RIGHT to (5,3) is safe. Then, moving RIGHT to (5,4) (apple) is safe.\n\nBut are there any other obstacles? Let's check if the body is in the way for either path.\n\nFor the DOWN path: (6,1) → (6,2) → (6,3). The body after moving DOWN would be (5,1), (4,1), etc. So (6,2) and (6,3) are not in the body. So that's safe.\n\nFor the RIGHT path: (5,2) → (5,3) → (5,4). The body after moving RIGHT would be (5,1), (4,1), etc. (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) are not in the body. So that's safe.\n\nSo both directions are possible. But which one leads to an apple sooner? Let's see:\n\nIf we move DOWN, then next step (epoch 37) is (6,1). Then, epoch 38, move RIGHT to (6,2). Epoch 39, move RIGHT to (6,3) (apple). So that's 3 epochs (current 36, then 37, 38, 39: 3 steps to reach apple).\n\nIf we move RIGHT now (epoch 36), then epoch 37: (5,2). Epoch 38: (5,3). Epoch 39: (5,4) (apple). Also 3 steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a closer apple. Let's check the apple at (6,6). That's further away.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake's current direction is DOWN. If we continue moving DOWN, the next position is (6,1), which is a safe space. If we turn RIGHT, that's allowed (since RIGHT is not the reverse of DOWN). So both options are valid.\n\nBut perhaps the best choice is to move RIGHT. Let's see: moving RIGHT now, the head goes to (5,2). Then, the next direction could be RIGHT again. Let's confirm that (5,2) is not part of the body, which it isn't. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN, then RIGHT. Both are safe.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another factor: the snake's body is in row 1, which is the top. The head is in row 5 and 6. So the body is in the upper part, so moving down or right is away from the body, which is safer.\n\nBut I think either direction is possible. However, perhaps moving RIGHT is better because the apple at (5,4) is in the same row as the head, so it's a straight path. Let's check again.\n\nThe head is at (5,1) (row 5, column 1). The apple at (5,4) is in the same row, three columns to the right. So moving RIGHT three times would reach it. That's a straight line, which is easier to navigate.\n\nIn contrast, the apple at (6,3) is in row 6, column 3. So moving down once, then right twice. That's also a straight path but requires a turn.\n\nSince the snake can turn (as long as it's not reversing direction), either is possible. But perhaps moving RIGHT now is better because it's a straight path in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if moving DOWN would lead to a position where the next move could hit the body. For example, after moving DOWN to (6,1), if the snake then moves DOWN again (to row 7, column 1), which is a wall (row 7 is all #). So moving DOWN again would hit the wall, which is bad. So after moving DOWN to (6,1), the next direction can't be DOWN again (since row 7 is a wall). So the snake would have to turn RIGHT or LEFT. But LEFT from (6,1) would be (6,0), which is a wall. So only RIGHT is possible. Which is good, because that's the direction of the apple.\n\nSo moving DOWN now, then RIGHT, then RIGHT would reach the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now, then RIGHT, then RIGHT would reach the apple in (5,4).\n\nBoth paths are safe. But which one is better? Since the problem is to choose the best direction, perhaps either is acceptable, but perhaps the intended answer is to move RIGHT.\n\nWait, let's check the initial example. In the example, when the direction was DOWN, the head moved down and ate an apple. So perhaps in this case, moving towards the apple in the same row is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check the positions again. Let's recheck the apple positions:\n\nRow 5: #H   A # → column 4 is A (position (5,4)).\n\nRow 6: #  A  A# → column 3 (6,3) and column 6 (6,6) are A's.\n\nSo (5,4) is in the same row as the head (row 5). The head is at (5,1). So moving RIGHT would approach (5,4). That's a good target.\n\nIf we move RIGHT now, the head is at (5,2). Then, next move RIGHT to (5,3). Then, RIGHT to (5,4), which is the apple. That's three moves. That's a valid path.\n\nSo the best direction here is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#S  S  #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#H   A #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN  \nCurrent epoch: 36  \n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) while avoiding collisions with walls\/body and prioritizing apple consumption.  \n\n### Key Observations:  \n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (row 5, column 1). The snake’s body (S) occupies positions: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (4,1).  \n- **Apples**: Located at (5,4), (6,3), and (6,6).  \n- **Movement Rules**: The snake cannot reverse direction (current direction is DOWN, so UP is invalid).  \n\n### Evaluation of Options:  \n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,1) leads to (5,0), which is a wall (row 5 starts with '#'). Collision → Game Over. **Invalid**.  \n2. **UP**: Reverse of current direction (DOWN) → Invalid.  \n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5,1) leads to (6,1), a safe empty space (not wall\/body). However, (6,1) has no apple, and further DOWN would hit row 7 (wall). Requires turning RIGHT afterward to reach apples, but this path is longer.  \n4. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5,1) leads to (5,2), a safe empty space (not wall\/body). From (5,2), continuing RIGHT leads to (5,3) (safe) and then (5,4) (apple). This is a direct, safe path to an apple in the same row as the head.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving RIGHT is optimal, as it avoids collisions, follows a clear path, and directly approaches the nearest apple in row 5.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SSSS  # (so positions (1,1) to (1,4) are 'S', then spaces)\nRow 2: #S     # (position (2,1) is 'S')\nRow 3: #S     # (position (3,1) is 'S')\nRow 4: #S     # (position (4,1) is 'S')\nRow 5: #SH  A # (positions (5,1) is 'S', (5,2) is 'H', then two spaces, (5,5) is 'A')\nRow 6: #  A  A# (positions (6,2) and (6,5) are 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the snake's head is at (5,2). Let's confirm the snake's body. The head is 'H' at (5,2). The body 'S' positions are:\n\nLooking at row 5: (5,1) is 'S' (adjacent to head, so next part of the body)\nRow 4: (4,1) is 'S' (so the body continues up from (5,1) to (4,1))\nRow 3: (3,1) is 'S'\nRow 2: (2,1) is 'S'\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) are 'S' (so the body goes from (2,1) to (1,1), then right along row 1 to (1,4))\n\nSo the snake's body is a vertical line from (5,1) up to (2,1), then turns right along row 1 from (1,1) to (1,4). The head is at (5,2), which is to the right of (5,1), so the current direction is RIGHT (as given), which makes sense because the head moved right into (5,2) from (5,1) in the previous step.\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction, so it can't go LEFT (since current is RIGHT, reversing would be LEFT). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT is the reverse and not allowed).\n\nNow, the snake's next move: the head is at (5,2). The next position depends on the direction chosen. Let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. RIGHT: Next head position would be (5,3). Let's check if that's a valid position. (5,3) in row 5 is a space (since row 5 is #SH  A #, so positions (5,0)=#, (5,1)=S, (5,2)=H, (5,3)= (space), (5,4)= (space), (5,5)=A, (5,6)=#). So (5,3) is a space. Then, the snake's body would shift. Since the current length is the number of 'S' plus 1 (head). Let's count the 'S's: row 1 has 4 S's, rows 2-4 each have 1 S, row 5 has 1 S. So 4 + 3 + 1 = 8 S's. So the snake length is 9 (since head is 1). When moving, the tail (the end of the body) would only be removed if the snake doesn't eat an apple. So if moving to (5,3) (no apple there), the tail (the last S) would be removed. The tail is the end of the body. The body's path: head (5,2) → (5,1) → (4,1) → (3,1) → (2,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (1,4). So the tail is at (1,4). So moving RIGHT, the new head is (5,3), and the tail (1,4) is removed. The new body would be (5,2) becomes S, (5,1) S, (4,1) S, (3,1) S, (2,1) S, (1,1) S, (1,2) S, (1,3) S. So (1,4) is no longer part of the body. So that's safe.\n\n2. UP: Next head position is (4,2). Let's check (4,2). Row 4 is #S     #, so (4,0)=#, (4,1)=S, (4,2)= (space). So (4,2) is a space. So moving UP, head goes to (4,2). The body would shift. The tail (1,4) would be removed. Check if (4,2) is a body part. Current body parts are (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (4,2) is not in these positions, so safe. So UP is possible.\n\n3. DOWN: Next head position is (6,2). Let's check (6,2). Row 6 is #  A  A#. So (6,0)=#, (6,1)= (space), (6,2)=A, (6,3)= (space), (6,4)= (space), (6,5)=A, (6,6)=#. So (6,2) is an apple! If the snake moves DOWN, it will eat the apple at (6,2). Then, the snake grows by 1, so the tail is not removed. The current length is 9, so after eating, length becomes 10. So the body would include all previous S's plus the new head (6,2) becomes H, and the previous head (5,2) becomes S, and the tail (1,4) remains (since no tail is removed when eating an apple). So moving DOWN here would get an apple, which is good for the score. Also, check if (6,2) is a wall or body. (6,2) is within the board (row 6, column 2; rows 0-7, columns 0-7, so 6 is within 0-7, 2 is within 0-7). Not a wall. The current body parts are (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (6,2) is not among them. So moving DOWN is safe and gets an apple. That's a good move.\n\n4. LEFT: Not allowed because current direction is RIGHT, and reversing direction is not allowed. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, RIGHT, DOWN. Let's evaluate which is best.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: head moves to (6,2), which is an apple. So score increases by 1, and the snake grows. The new head is (6,2), which was an apple. The next state would have that apple removed, and a new apple might be generated (but the problem states that the game starts with 3 apples, but it's not clear if new apples are added when eaten. The example given in the problem shows that after eating an apple, the next board has the apple replaced. For example, in the example, after moving DOWN, the apple where H was (original position) is gone, and the new H is in the next position. So in the given example, after eating, the apple is consumed and the snake's head is there. So in our current case, moving DOWN to (6,2) which is an 'A' would result in eating it, so that 'A' is removed, and the snake's head is now there. The snake's body would now include (5,2) as S, (5,1) as S, etc., and the tail (1,4) remains (since length increased by 1). So this is a safe move and gains a point.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: moving to (5,3), which is empty. No apple, so the tail (1,4) is removed. The snake doesn't gain length. But (5,3) is safe.\n\nIf we choose UP: moving to (4,2), which is empty. Also safe, but no apple.\n\nSo the best choice here is to go DOWN, as it allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score. Let's confirm that moving DOWN is allowed. The current direction is RIGHT, so possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse). So DOWN is allowed.\n\nCheck for collisions when moving DOWN. The new head position is (6,2). The current body parts are (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (6,2) is not in these positions, so no self-collision. The walls are at the edges (row 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7). (6,2) is in row 6 (valid, since 0-7), column 2 (valid, 0-7). So no wall collision. So moving DOWN is safe and rewards with an apple.\n\n\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SH  A #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current snake position, possible moves, and apple locations:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 5, column 2). The body 'S' extends upward from (5,1) to (2,1), then right along row 1 to (1,4). The current direction is RIGHT.\n\n2. **Valid Directions**: The snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT is invalid). Possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n3. **Analysis of Moves**:\n   - **RIGHT**: Next head position (5,3) is empty (no apple). The tail (1,4) would be removed (no growth). Safe but no score gain.\n   - **UP**: Next head position (4,2) is empty (no apple). The tail (1,4) would be removed. Safe but no score gain.\n   - **DOWN**: Next head position (6,2) contains an apple 'A'. Eating the apple increases the score by 1, grows the snake (no tail removal), and avoids self\/wall collisions (body parts are at (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4); (6,2) is not a body part or wall).\n\nThe best move is DOWN, as it safely eats an apple and grows the snake.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided. \n\nThe board is 8x8. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #SSS   # (so columns 1-3 are 'S', rest empty)\nRow 2: #S     # (column 1 is 'S')\nRow 3: #S     # (column 1 is 'S')\nRow 4: #S     # (column 1 is 'S')\nRow 5: #SS  A # (columns 1-2 are 'S', column 5 is 'A')\nRow 6: # HA  A# (column 2 is 'H', column 4 is 'A', column 6 is 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at row 6, column 2. The current direction is DOWN. Let's check the snake's body. The body 'S's are in the following positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\nRow 2: (2,1)\nRow 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1)\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,2)\n\nSo the snake's body forms a sort of vertical line along column 1 from row 2-4, then turns right at row 5 (columns 1-2), and row 1 has three S's in columns 1-3. The head is at (6,2), which is below row 5's (5,2) S. So the snake's body is connected from head (6,2) up to (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). That makes sense as the snake's body.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake moves one square per step. The snake can't reverse direction. So if current direction is DOWN, the snake can't immediately go UP. The possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since UP is reverse).\n\nNow, we need to check where the head would move next based on the direction we choose. Let's consider each possible direction:\n\n1. Current direction is DOWN. If we choose to continue moving DOWN (direction remains DOWN), then the new head position would be (7,2). But row 7 is the bottom wall (all #), so moving DOWN would cause a collision with the wall. That's a game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\n2. Direction LEFT: The head is at (6,2). Moving LEFT would take it to (6,1). Let's check what's at (6,1). The current row 6 is \"# HA  A#\", so column 1 is a space (since the H is at column 2). So (6,1) is empty. But wait, need to check if that's part of the snake's body. The snake's body includes (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). (6,1) is not part of the body (since row 6, column 1 is empty). So moving LEFT to (6,1) is safe. But what's the next step? Let's see if there's an apple there. (6,1) is empty, so no apple. The snake would move, and the tail would move (since the length is such that when it moves, the tail might shrink if no apple is eaten. But since no apple is eaten, the snake's length remains the same, so the tail (the last S) would be removed. But that's probably handled automatically.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT: The head is at (6,2). Moving RIGHT would take it to (6,3). Let's check row 6: \"# HA  A#\". The H is at column 2, so columns 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is H, 3 is space, 4 is A, 5 is space, 6 is A, 7 is #. So (6,3) is a space. Is that part of the snake's body? The body is in columns 1-3 of row 1, and column 1 of rows 2-4, columns 1-2 of row 5. (6,3) is not part of the body, so moving RIGHT is safe.\n\n4. Direction UP: The current direction is DOWN. The snake can't reverse direction, so UP is not allowed. Because reversing (DOWN to UP) is not permitted. So UP is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT. Now, let's check for apples. The current apples are at (5,5) (row 5, column 5), (6,4), (6,6). Let's see where the snake can move to reach apples.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT, the head moves to (6,3). Next step, if the direction is RIGHT again, the head would go to (6,4), which is an apple. That's a good move. Because moving RIGHT now would allow the snake to reach the apple at (6,4) next step. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head (6,2). Direction RIGHT: new head (6,3). Since (6,3) is empty, no apple eaten. The snake's body would shift: the previous head (6,2) becomes S, and the tail (which is the last S in the body) is removed. The tail is currently at (1,3), because the body is (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2). So the tail is (1,3). When moving, if no apple is eaten, the tail (1,3) is removed. So the new body would be (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2) as S, and new head (6,3). \n\nThen, in the next step, if direction remains RIGHT, the head would go to (6,4), which is an apple. Eating that apple would increase the score, and the snake would grow (so the tail isn't removed that time). That's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose LEFT, moving to (6,1). Then, the next direction could be... Let's see. After moving LEFT, the new head is (6,1). The next possible directions would be LEFT (reverse of RIGHT, but current direction would be LEFT now), or UP (since current direction after moving LEFT would be LEFT, so can't reverse to RIGHT). But (6,1) is adjacent to (5,1), which is part of the body. If the snake moves UP from (6,1), it would go to (5,1), which is S. That's a collision. So moving LEFT might lead to a dead end.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT now (to (6,3)) is safe, and the next step can reach the apple at (6,4). So that's a better option.\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any other possible collisions. Let's confirm the possible moves again.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: (6,2) → (6,3). Check (6,3): is it a wall? No. Is it part of the body? The body S's are in (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2). (6,3) is not in those positions, so it's safe. So RIGHT is a valid direction.\n\nSo the best direction here is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSS   #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SS  A #\n# HA  A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at row 6, column 2. The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). We need to choose between LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but DOWN would move the head to row 7 (a wall), causing a collision. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (6,1), which is empty and safe. However, this direction leads away from the nearest apples and may limit future movement options.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6,3), which is empty and safe. This direction positions the snake to reach the apple at (6,4) in the next move, allowing it to eat the apple and grow.  \n\nChoosing RIGHT is optimal as it avoids collisions, moves toward an apple, and maintains safe movement options. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as required. \n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body segments are 'S', and apples are 'A'. Let's parse the board row by row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #SSS   # (so positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are 'S')\nRow 2: #S     # (position (2,1) is 'S')\nRow 3: #S     # (position (3,1) is 'S')\nRow 4: #S    A# (position (4,1) is 'S', (4,5) is 'A')\nRow 5: #SS  A # (positions (5,1), (5,2) are 'S'; (5,5) is 'A')\nRow 6: # SH  A# (positions (6,2) is 'S', (6,3) is 'H'; (6,5) is 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at position (6,3) (row 6, column 3). The current direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right, so the next position the head would move to is (6,4) if the direction remains RIGHT. Let's check that position. \n\nWhat's in (6,4)? Looking at row 6: \"# SH  A#\" which is characters 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'H', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (6,4) is a space, which is empty. That's good. But wait, we need to check possible collisions. Also, we need to consider if changing direction is possible (can't reverse). The current direction is RIGHT, so possible directions to turn are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT. Can't turn LEFT (reverse).\n\nLet's list the possible directions and their outcomes:\n\n1. Current direction is RIGHT. Next head position is (6,4). Let's check if that's a wall or body. The walls are at columns 0 and 7, rows 0 and 7. (6,4) is within the board (rows 1-6, columns 1-6). So no wall collision. What's in (6,4)? It's a space. So moving right here would be safe. Then, after moving, the snake's body would shift. Since the snake is moving, the tail would move if it's not growing. But wait, the snake's length depends on how many apples it's eaten. The initial length is 1. Each apple eaten increases length by 1. Let's count the number of 'S' and 'H' to find the current length. \n\nCurrent snake body: Let's list all 'S' and 'H' positions. \n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) → 3 S\nRow 2: (2,1) → 1 S\nRow 3: (3,1) → 1 S\nRow 4: (4,1) → 1 S\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,2) → 2 S\nRow 6: (6,2) → 1 S, (6,3) → H\nTotal S: 3+1+1+1+2+1 = 9. H is 1. So total length is 10. That means the snake has eaten 9 apples (since initial length is 1, 1 + 9 apples = 10).\n\nNow, the apples on the board: let's check. \n\nRow 1: No A.\nRow 2: No A.\nRow 3: No A.\nRow 4: (4,5) → A\nRow 5: (5,5) → A\nRow 6: (6,5) → A\nSo there are 3 apples left. So if the snake moves right to (6,4), that's empty. Then, the next position. The snake's body would move: the head moves to (6,4), and each body segment follows the previous one. The tail (the last S) would be removed unless the snake just ate an apple. Since (6,4) is not an apple, the tail would move. Let's think about the tail position. The current snake's body is a chain. The head is at (6,3), then the next segment is (6,2). Then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). Wait, the snake's body path: Let's trace from head backwards. Head is (6,3). The body adjacent to head is (6,2) (since (6,3) is H, (6,2) is S). Then from (6,2), the next segment would be (5,2) (since row 5 has (5,2) as S). Then (5,1) (row 5, column 1). Then (4,1) (row 4, column 1). Then (3,1) (row 3, column 1). Then (2,1) (row 2, column 1). Then (1,1) (row 1, column 1). Then (1,2) (row 1, column 2). Then (1,3) (row 1, column 3). So the tail is at (1,3). Because that's the last S in the chain. So when the snake moves right, the head moves to (6,4), and the tail (1,3) is removed (since no apple was eaten). So the new body segments would be (6,3) (now S), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). The new tail would be (1,2). \n\nNow, possible directions: can we turn up, down, or right. Let's check each possible direction.\n\nOption 1: Continue RIGHT. Next head position (6,4). Is that safe? Let's check if (6,4) is a body part. The current body parts are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2). (6,4) is not in any of these. So safe. Then, after moving, the next position. The next move would be towards (6,5), which is an apple (A). So if the snake moves right to (6,4), then next move (epoch 40) could be right again to (6,5), which is an apple. That would be good, as eating that apple would increase the score.\n\nOption 2: Turn UP. Current direction is RIGHT. Turning UP is allowed (not reverse). The head is at (6,3). Moving UP would take it to (5,3). Let's check (5,3). Row 5 is \"#SS  A #\". Columns: 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (5,3) is a space. Is that position part of the snake's body? Current body positions: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2). (5,3) is not in these, so safe. Then, moving up to (5,3). Then, the next direction could be up again, but let's see if that's useful. There's an apple at (5,5), so maybe moving towards that. But perhaps not as direct as moving right towards (6,5) which is an apple.\n\nOption 3: Turn DOWN. Current direction is RIGHT. Turning DOWN would take the head from (6,3) to (7,3). But row 7 is the bottom wall (all '#'). So (7,3) is a wall. That would cause a collision, game over. So turning down is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are RIGHT, UP. Turning down is into a wall. Turning left is reverse (current direction is right, left is reverse, which is not allowed). So left is invalid.\n\nSo the options are RIGHT or UP. Let's evaluate which is better.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: next head position (6,4) (safe). Then, the next epoch (40), the snake can move right again to (6,5), which is an apple. Eating that apple would grow the snake. So that's a good path. \n\nIf we choose UP: next head position (5,3). Then, what's around (5,3)? The next possible moves could be right (towards (5,4), then (5,5) which is an apple). But (5,5) is an apple, so that's another possible path. But moving right first gets us to (6,4), then (6,5) apple. Which is a shorter path.\n\nAlso, check if moving right (6,4) is safe. Yes, as (6,4) is empty. Then, moving to (6,5) (apple) would be the next step. So the immediate next move (epoch 40) would be to eat that apple, which is optimal. \n\nTherefore, the best direction is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\n\n########\n#SSS   #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#SS  A #\n# SH  A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- **Snake Head Position**: (6,3) (row 6, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT (snake is moving right).\n- **Board Constraints**: Walls are at the edges (rows 0\/7, columns 0\/7). The snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT is invalid here).\n- **Apples**: Located at (4,5), (5,5), (6,5).\n- **Snake Body**: Segments are at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **RIGHT**: Next head position is (6,4). This cell is empty (no wall or body collision). Moving right keeps the snake on a path toward the apple at (6,5) (next move in epoch 40), which is optimal for eating an apple and growing.\n2. **UP**: Next head position is (5,3). This cell is empty, but it diverts the snake away from the closest apple at (6,5), requiring more steps to reach an apple.\n3. **DOWN**: Next head position is (7,3), which is a wall (game over). Invalid.\n4. **LEFT**: Reverse of current direction (RIGHT), which is not allowed. Invalid.\n\n**Best Choice**: Continuing RIGHT safely moves the snake toward the nearest apple at (6,5), maximizing the score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls as '#'. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #SS    # (so positions (1,1) and (1,2) are 'S' (body), rest spaces)\nRow 2: #S     # (position (2,1) is 'S')\nRow 3: #S     # (position (3,1) is 'S')\nRow 4: #S    A# (position (4,1) is 'S', (4,5) is 'A')\nRow 5: #SS  A # (positions (5,1) and (5,2) are 'S', (5,5) is 'A')\nRow 6: # SSH A# (positions (6,1) is 'S', (6,2) is 'S', (6,3) is 'H' (head), (6,5) is 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at position (6,3). The current direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right, so normally, the next move would be to (6,4) if it continues RIGHT. Let's check what's in (6,4). Looking at row 6: \"# SSH A#\", so positions are 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'H', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: '#'. So (6,4) is a space (empty). \n\nBut we need to check possible directions. The snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is RIGHT, the snake can't go LEFT (reverse). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. RIGHT (current direction). Next head position would be (6,4). What's there? It's empty (space). The snake's body is in positions (6,1), (6,2), (5,1), (5,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). So (6,4) is not part of the body. Also, it's not a wall. So moving RIGHT is safe. After moving, the head is at (6,4). Since there's no apple there, the snake doesn't grow. The body moves: the tail (which is the last 'S') would be removed unless an apple is eaten. But since there's no apple, the tail (the earliest 'S' in the sequence) would move. Let's track the snake's body. The snake's body is a sequence. The head is at (6,3). The body segments are (6,2), (6,1), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,2), (1,1)? Wait, let's reconstruct the snake's path. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the board, the 'S's are:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2)\nRow 2: (2,1)\nRow 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1)\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,2)\nRow 6: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) is H.\n\nSo the snake's body is a continuous path. Let's trace the snake's body from the head backwards. The head is at (6,3). The adjacent 'S' would be (6,2) (since current direction is RIGHT, the previous position of the head was (6,2), and before that (6,1), then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)? Wait, that might not be the case. Let's think about the snake's movement. Since the snake moves one square at a time, each 'S' is where the head was in previous steps. The head is at (6,3). The previous position (when moving RIGHT) would be (6,2) (so (6,2) is the next body segment). Then before that, (6,1), then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) (since row 1 has (1,1) and (1,2)). So the body is a chain: H at (6,3) → (6,2) → (6,1) → (5,2) → (5,1) → (4,1) → (3,1) → (2,1) → (1,1) → (1,2). So the tail is at (1,2). \n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (6,4), the new head is (6,4). The body segments shift: (6,3) becomes 'S', (6,2) remains 'S', (6,1) remains 'S', (5,2) remains 'S', (5,1) remains 'S', (4,1) remains 'S', (3,1) remains 'S', (2,1) remains 'S', (1,1) remains 'S', and the tail (1,2) would be removed (since no apple was eaten). So the new board's row 1 would have (1,1) as 'S' and (1,2) as space, and row 6, (6,4) is 'H', (6,3) is 'S'.\n\nBut maybe I need to check if moving in other directions is better. Let's check UP. Current direction is RIGHT. So UP is allowed (not reverse). Moving UP would mean the head moves from (6,3) to (5,3). Let's check (5,3). Row 5 is \"#SS  A #\". So positions are 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: '#'. So (5,3) is space. Is that part of the body? The body is at (5,1), (5,2), so (5,3) is safe. So moving UP is possible.\n\nMoving DOWN: the head would go from (6,3) to (7,3). But row 7 is all walls (########), so (7,3) is a wall. So moving DOWN would cause collision with the wall, which ends the game. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are RIGHT, UP.\n\nNow, let's check if there are apples in the possible next positions. For RIGHT: (6,4) is space, no apple. For UP: (5,3) is space, no apple. So neither direction immediately gets an apple. But maybe we need to look for the next steps to reach apples.\n\nLooking at the apples on the board. Apples are at:\n\nRow 4: (4,5) is 'A' (column 5, row 4)\nRow 5: (5,5) is 'A' (column 5, row 5)\nRow 6: (6,5) is 'A' (column 5, row 6)\n\nSo there are three apples. The head is at (6,3). The closest apples are in column 5 (since 6,3 to 6,5 is two steps to the right). So if the snake continues moving RIGHT, next step to (6,4), then next step to (6,5) (which is an apple). That would be good. Let's check:\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. If we move RIGHT, next head at (6,4). Then next move (epoch 41) would be direction (could be RIGHT again, as current direction would be RIGHT). Then (6,5) is the apple. So moving RIGHT now allows the snake to reach the apple at (6,5) in the next step. That's a good plan.\n\nIf we move UP now, the head is at (5,3). Then next possible directions: current direction would be UP. So possible directions (can't reverse, so can't go DOWN). Then possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's see. From (5,3), moving RIGHT would go to (5,4). Then (5,5) is the apple. So that's another path. But which path is safer?\n\nLet's check if moving RIGHT now is safe. After moving RIGHT to (6,4), the next step (epoch 41) would be moving RIGHT again (assuming we choose RIGHT again). Then head at (6,5), which is the apple. Eating that apple would increase the score, and the snake grows. That's a good move.\n\nWhat if we move UP? The head is at (5,3). The body is in (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) (now becomes 'S'), etc. So (5,3) is safe. Then, moving RIGHT from (5,3) would reach (5,4), then (5,5) (apple). That's also possible. But which path is better?\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is better because it's a straight path to the apple in (6,5). Let's check if there's any body in the path. The snake's body in row 6 is (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) (head). So (6,4) and (6,5) are empty. So moving RIGHT now, then RIGHT again would reach the apple. That's safe.\n\nSo the best direction here is to continue moving RIGHT. Because moving RIGHT now is safe, and the next step can reach the apple at (6,5). Moving UP might also be possible, but the apple at (6,5) is closer. Also, moving DOWN is invalid (hits the wall). So the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS    #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#SS  A #\n# SSH A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction (RIGHT), and potential moves. The snake's head 'H' is at (6,3) (row 6, column 3). The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid), leaving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT as options.\n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,3), which is a wall (`#`). This causes an immediate collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (5,3). This cell is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe. However, this path does not immediately lead to an apple.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6,4), which is empty (no wall or body). This is safe. The next step (if continuing RIGHT) would reach (6,5), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple would grow the snake and increase the score.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is safe and positions the snake to reach an apple in the next step. Other directions either lead to collision (DOWN) or do not directly target an apple (UP). \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by analyzing the game board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's list out each row to get a clear picture:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #S     # (so positions (1,1) is S)\nRow 2: #S     # (position (2,1) is S)\nRow 3: #S     # (position (3,1) is S)\nRow 4: #S    A# (position (4,1) is S, (4,5) is A)\nRow 5: #SS  A # (positions (5,1)=S, (5,2)=S; (5,5)=A)\nRow 6: # SSSHA# (positions (6,2)=S, (6,3)=S, (6,4)=S, (6,5)=H, (6,6)=A)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,5) (since H is in row 6, column 5). The current direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction, so it can't go LEFT immediately. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since current is RIGHT, reversing would be LEFT, which is not allowed).\n\nWait, the movement direction rules: the snake can't reverse direction. So if current direction is RIGHT, the next direction can't be LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's track the snake's body. The head is H at (6,5). The body parts are S. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1)\nRow 2: (2,1)\nRow 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1)\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,2)\nRow 6: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo the snake's body is a long line from (1,1) down to (4,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), and the head at (6,5). So the snake is shaped like a vertical line on the left (rows 1-4, column 1), then turns right at row 5, column 1 to 2, then continues right to row 6, columns 2,3,4, then head at 5. So the body is following the path: (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (4,1) → (5,1) → (5,2) → (6,2) → (6,3) → (6,4) → (6,5) (head). That makes sense, as each S is the previous position of the head or body as the snake moves.\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT (current direction). So the next move would be to the right of the head's current position. The head is at (6,5). Moving RIGHT would take it to (6,6). Let's check (6,6) on the board. Looking at row 6: # SSSHA#. So row 6 has columns 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is S, 3 is S, 4 is S, 5 is H, 6 is A, 7 is #. So (6,6) is A (an apple). So if the snake moves RIGHT, it will eat the apple at (6,6). That's good because eating the apple increases the score and the snake grows. But we need to check if moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nWhat's (6,6) after moving? The head would be there. The current head is at (6,5). The next position is (6,6). The square (6,6) is A, so that's safe (no collision with body or wall). The wall is at column 7 (since row 6 is ########, column 7 is #). So (6,6) is within the board (columns 0-7, so 6 is okay). So moving RIGHT is possible.\n\nAlternatively, let's check other possible directions. The snake can't go LEFT (reverse of RIGHT). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nCheck UP: The head is at (6,5). Moving UP would take it to (5,5). Let's check (5,5) on the board. Row 5 is #SS  A #. Columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3: (space), 4: (space), 5:A, 6: (space), 7: #. So (5,5) is A (apple). So moving UP would take the head to (5,5), which is an apple. Is that safe? Let's check if (5,5) is part of the snake's body. The body positions are the S's listed earlier. (5,5) is A, not S. So no collision. So moving UP is possible.\n\nCheck DOWN: The head is at (6,5). Moving DOWN would take it to (7,5). But row 7 is ######## (all walls). So (7,5) is a wall. So moving DOWN would cause a collision with the wall, which ends the game. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are RIGHT and UP. Let's evaluate both.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT: next head position (6,6), which is A. The snake eats the apple, grows. The new body would include the previous head position (6,5) as S, and the rest of the body shifts. The new board would have H at (6,6), and (6,5) becomes S. Since the snake grows, the tail (the end of the body) doesn't move. The current tail is at (1,1), since the body is (1,1) → (2,1) → ... → (6,4) → (6,5) (H). So when the snake moves, the tail would stay if it eats an apple (since length increases). So the body would now include all previous S's plus the old H. So moving RIGHT is safe and gains a point.\n\nIf the snake moves UP: head goes to (5,5), which is A. That's also an apple. Let's check if (5,5) is safe. (5,5) is not part of the body (current body S's are at (5,1), (5,2)). So moving UP is safe. Then, the snake would eat that apple, grow, and the new head is (5,5). The previous head (6,5) becomes S. The body would adjust accordingly. \n\nNow, which direction is better? Let's see the positions. The snake's current direction is RIGHT. If it continues RIGHT, it's moving along the current path. The next position (6,6) is A. After that, what's next? The next move (epoch 42) would be in direction chosen. But since the snake is moving RIGHT, if it continues, after eating (6,6), the next position would be (6,7), which is a wall (since row 6, column 7 is #). So if the snake moves RIGHT now (epoch 41), then in epoch 42, if it continues RIGHT, it would hit the wall. But the player can choose direction each epoch, so perhaps after moving RIGHT and eating the apple, the player can change direction. But the current decision is for epoch 41.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP (to (5,5), which is A) would be safe. Then, the next position (epoch 42) could be directions other than DOWN (since current direction would then be UP). Let's check (5,5) after moving up. The head is at (5,5). What's around (5,5)? The body is at (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) (now S). So (5,5) is A. After eating, the body would include (6,5) as S. So the next possible directions would be UP, DOWN, LEFT (but can't reverse from UP, so can't go DOWN). Wait, no: the direction after moving UP would be the direction chosen. The current direction after moving UP would be UP (if the player inputs UP as direction). Then, next move would be UP again, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT is better because (6,6) is an apple, and after that, the snake can turn. Let's check the other apples. On the board, there are apples at (4,5) (row 4, column 5), (5,5) (row 5, column 5), and (6,6) (row 6, column 6). So the current apples are at (4,5), (5,5), (6,6). The snake's head is at (6,5). So (6,6) is adjacent (RIGHT), (5,5) is UP, (4,5) is UP two steps.\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, it eats (6,6) apple. Then, the next head would be (6,6). The next possible directions (epoch 42) can't be LEFT (reverse of RIGHT). So possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. But (6,7) is a wall (RIGHT would hit wall), so RIGHT is invalid. So next direction could be UP (to (5,6)), which is currently a space (since row 5 is #SS  A # → column 6 is space). That's safe. Alternatively, DOWN (to (7,6)), which is a wall. So UP would be the way to go. \n\nIf the snake moves UP (to (5,5)), that's an apple. Then, the head is at (5,5). Next possible directions (epoch 42) can't be DOWN (reverse of UP). So possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check (5,5) adjacent positions. UP would be (4,5) which is an apple (current row 4, column 5 is A). That's good. So moving UP now (epoch 41) to (5,5) (apple), then next move (epoch 42) UP to (4,5) (another apple). That's two apples in two moves. That might be better.\n\nWait, current apples are (4,5), (5,5), (6,6). So (5,5) is one, (4,5) is another. If the snake moves UP (epoch 41) to (5,5) (eats that apple), then in epoch 42, if direction is UP, moves to (4,5) (another apple). That's efficient.\n\nBut let's check if moving UP is possible. The current head is at (6,5). Moving UP to (5,5) is (row 5, column 5). Is that square part of the snake's body? The snake's body is S's. Looking at row 5: #SS  A #. So columns 1 and 2 are S, column 5 is A. So (5,5) is A, not S. So moving UP is safe (no collision with body). So UP is a valid direction.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,6) (A) is also safe, as (6,6) is A, not S or wall. So both directions are possible. Which is better? Let's see the snake's body. The snake's body is a long line, and if it moves UP, it's moving towards another apple (4,5). If it moves RIGHT, it's moving towards the wall (column 7), but after that, it can turn up. \n\nBut perhaps moving UP is better because it leads to another apple immediately. Let's confirm the positions:\n\nCurrent head: (6,5)\nCurrent direction: RIGHT.\n\nPossible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. DOWN is invalid (wall). So options are UP and RIGHT.\n\nIf direction is UP:\nNew head position: (5,5). Which is A. Safe. Then, in next step (epoch 42), the snake can move UP again to (4,5) (another A). That's two apples in two moves.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT:\nNew head position: (6,6). Which is A. Safe. Then, next step (epoch 42), possible directions (can't go LEFT). So directions could be UP (to (5,6)), which is empty, or RIGHT (to (6,7), which is wall, invalid), or DOWN (to (7,6), wall, invalid). So UP is possible, but (5,6) is empty, not an apple. So the next apple would be (4,5) which is further.\n\nSo moving UP now allows the snake to reach two apples in two steps, whereas moving RIGHT gets one apple now but the next step is to an empty space. Therefore, moving UP is better.\n\nWait, but let's make sure that moving UP doesn't cause a collision. The head is at (6,5). Moving UP to (5,5). Are there any S's in (5,5)? The row 5 is #SS  A #. So columns 1 and 2 are S, column 5 is A. So (5,5) is A, not S. So no collision. Safe.\n\nTherefore, the best direction is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#SS  A #\n# SSSHA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6,5) (row 6, column 5), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot choose LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,5), which is a wall (row 7 is all walls). This would cause a collision, ending the game. Thus, DOWN is invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (6,6), which is an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body) and would allow the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (5,5), which is also an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body) and would allow the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score.  \n\nBetween RIGHT and UP:  \n- Moving RIGHT leads to (6,6) (an apple) but the next move (epoch 42) would have limited safe directions (e.g., UP to (5,6), an empty space).  \n- Moving UP leads to (5,5) (an apple) and the next move (epoch 42) can continue UP to (4,5), another apple, allowing the snake to eat two apples in two moves.  \n\nThus, moving UP is more optimal.  \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position and direction.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S', apples are 'A'. The current direction is UP, and the epoch is 42, which is well before 100, so the game isn't ending yet.\n\nFirst, let's map out the board. Let's list each row from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7):\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #S     # (so column 1 is S, others empty)\nRow 2: #S     # (column 1 is S)\nRow 3: #S  A  # (column 1 is S, column 4 is A)\nRow 4: #S    A# (column 1 is S, column 5 is A)\nRow 5: #SS  H # (columns 1 and 2 are S, column 5 is H)\nRow 6: # SSSSA# (column 1 is space, columns 2-5 are S, column 6 is A)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is in row 5, column 5 (assuming rows start at 0, columns 0-7). Let's confirm that:\n\nRow 5 is \"#SS  H #\", which is characters: [0]# [1]S [2]S [3] [4] [5]H [6] [7]#. So yes, H is at (5,5) (row 5, column 5).\n\nThe current direction is UP. So the snake is moving up. The next position the head would move to is (5-1,5) = (4,5). Let's check what's there.\n\nRow 4 is \"#S    A#\". Column 5 of row 4: let's see, row 4's characters: [0]# [1]S [2] [3] [4] [5]A [6] [7]#. So (4,5) is 'A' (an apple). Oh, that's good! Because if the snake moves UP (current direction), the head will go to (4,5), which is an apple. So eating that apple would increase the score by 1, and the snake would grow. Also, since the direction is UP, the snake can't reverse direction (so can't go DOWN now). The possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since current is UP, can't go DOWN).\n\nWait, but the player can choose to change direction to LEFT, RIGHT, or keep going UP. But the snake's movement is such that each move is in the direction it's facing. The player's input is the new direction, but the snake can't reverse. So current direction is UP, possible new directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse).\n\nBut let's check where each direction would take the head:\n\nCurrent head position: (5,5).\n\nCurrent direction is UP. So if we keep direction UP, next head position is (4,5) which is 'A' (apple). That's a good move because eating the apple will grow the snake and increase the score. No collision here because (4,5) is an apple, not a wall or body.\n\nIf we choose LEFT, the direction would change to LEFT. The next head position would be (5,5-1) = (5,4). Let's check row 5, column 4: row 5 is \"#SS  H #\", columns 0-7: 0=#, 1=S, 2=S, 3= (space), 4= (space), 5=H, 6= (space), 7=#. So (5,4) is a space. Is that part of the snake's body? Let's check the body positions. The snake's body is all the 'S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1, column 1: S\n\nRow 2, column 1: S\n\nRow 3, column 1: S\n\nRow 4, column 1: S\n\nRow 5, columns 1 and 2: S\n\nRow 6, columns 2,3,4,5: S (row 6 is \"# SSSSA#\", so columns 2-5 are S)\n\nSo (5,4) is a space (not S), so moving LEFT to (5,4) is safe. But there's no apple there. So that's a possible move but no apple.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT, direction becomes RIGHT. Next head position is (5,5+1) = (5,6). Check row 5, column 6: row 5 is \"#SS  H #\", column 6 is a space (since the row ends with # at 7). So (5,6) is a space. No apple there. Also, check if that's part of the body. The body S's are in other positions, so (5,6) is safe. But no apple.\n\nIf we choose UP (current direction), the next position is (4,5) which is 'A'. So that's the best option because it allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and increase the score. Also, moving UP here is allowed (since it's not reversing direction). There's no collision because (4,5) is an apple, not a wall (walls are the edges, row 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7). The snake's body is in other positions, so (4,5) is not S. So moving UP is safe and gains an apple.\n\nTherefore, the best direction to choose is UP.\n\n\n########\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S  A  #\n#S    A#\n#SS  H #\n# SSSSA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is currently at position (5,5) (row 5, column 5) and moving UP. The next position if continuing UP is (4,5), which contains an apple ('A'). Moving UP will allow the snake to eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length. \n\nPossible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since reversing to DOWN is not allowed). Moving UP is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body) and rewards with an apple. Moving LEFT or RIGHT would lead to empty spaces without apples. Thus, the optimal choice is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided. \n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' walls. Let's parse each row from top to bottom:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #      # (empty except walls)\nRow 2: #S     # (has a 'S' in column 1)\nRow 3: #S  A  # (column 1 is 'S', column 4 is 'A')\nRow 4: #S   HA# (column 1 is 'S', column 4 is 'H' (head), column 5 is 'A')\nRow 5: #SS  S # (columns 1 and 2 are 'S', column 5 is 'S')\nRow 6: # SSSSA# (columns 2,3,4,5 are 'S', column 6 is 'A')\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe snake's head is 'H' at position (row 4, column 4) because row 4 is \"#S   HA#\", so let's index columns from 0 to 7. Let's check each character in row 4:\n\nColumns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: 'A', 6: '#', 7: (but row 4 is 8 characters, so columns 0-7). So H is at (4,4). \n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake is moving up. Let's remember that the snake can't reverse direction. So if current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. The possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse).\n\nNow, the snake moves one square in the direction. Let's see where the head would go next if we choose each possible direction.\n\nFirst, current head position is (4,4). Let's list the possible next positions based on direction:\n\n- UP: (3,4) (since moving up decreases row by 1)\n- LEFT: (4,3) (column decreases by 1)\n- RIGHT: (4,5) (column increases by 1)\n- DOWN: (5,4) (row increases by 1) but this is reverse of current direction (UP), so invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWe need to check each of these to see if they are safe (not hitting wall or self) and if they have an apple (A) to eat.\n\nFirst, check UP direction: next position (3,4). Let's look at row 3, column 4. Row 3 is \"#S  A  #\". Columns: 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: '#', 7: (but 8 columns). So (3,4) is 'A' (apple). So moving UP would take the head to (3,4), which is an apple. That's good because eating it increases the score and the snake grows. Now, is there a collision? The next position (3,4) is an apple, not a wall or 'S' (snake body). So safe.\n\nNext, check LEFT direction: next position (4,3). Row 4 is \"#S   HA#\". Column 3 in row 4 is ' ' (since columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: 'A', 6: '#'). So (4,3) is empty. But we need to check if that's part of the snake's body. Let's check the snake's body positions. The snake's body is represented by 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 2, column 1: (2,1)\nRow 3, column 1: (3,1)\nRow 4, column 1: (4,1)\nRow 5, column 1: (5,1)\nRow 5, column 2: (5,2)\nRow 5, column 5: (5,5)\nRow 6, column 2: (6,2)\nRow 6, column 3: (6,3)\nRow 6, column 4: (6,4)\nRow 6, column 5: (6,5)\n\nSo (4,3) is not in any of these positions, so it's safe. But there's no apple here, so moving left would just move the head there, and the snake's tail would move (since it's not growing).\n\nCheck RIGHT direction: next position (4,5). Row 4, column 5 is 'A' (from \"#S   HA#\"). So (4,5) is an apple. Let's check if that's safe. The position (4,5) is 'A', so no collision. So moving right would also eat an apple.\n\nNow, need to check if moving UP or RIGHT would cause any issues. Let's check the positions.\n\nIf moving UP: (3,4) is 'A' (safe). The next position after moving up, the snake's head is there, and since it's an apple, the snake grows. So the body would not lose a segment. So the new head is (3,4), and the previous head (4,4) becomes 'S', and the rest of the body follows.\n\nIf moving RIGHT: (4,5) is 'A' (safe). Head moves to (4,5), previous head (4,4) becomes 'S'.\n\nNow, let's check if moving UP would lead to any collision in the next steps. Let's see the current body positions. For example, if the head moves to (3,4), then the next positions would be (3,4) as H, (4,4) as S, etc. Let's check if (3,4) is adjacent to any body parts. The current body in row 3 is (3,1). (3,4) is column 4, which is far from (3,1), so no collision.\n\nIf moving RIGHT to (4,5), which is (4,5). Let's check if that's adjacent to any body. The body in row 4 is (4,1). (4,5) is column 5, which is far from (4,1). So no collision.\n\nSo both UP and RIGHT directions are possible and would eat apples. What about the current direction is UP. The snake is moving UP, so if we choose UP, that's continuing the current direction, which is allowed.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the player provides direction inputs, and the snake moves in that direction. So the direction input is the new direction, but the snake can't reverse. So if current direction is UP, the next direction can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse).\n\nSo possible options are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's check if there's any other considerations. For example, after moving UP, what's the next position? The head would be at (3,4), which is an apple. Then, the snake grows. The next epoch, the direction could be adjusted again.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (4,5), which is an apple. Also safe.\n\nBut which direction is better? Let's see if moving UP could lead to a wall collision in the next steps. Let's see, moving UP from (4,4) to (3,4). The next possible direction could be UP again (to row 2, column 4). Let's check row 2: \"#S     #\". Column 4 in row 2 is ' ' (empty), so safe. So moving UP is safe.\n\nMoving RIGHT: (4,5) is 'A', then next possible direction could be RIGHT again (column 6), but row 4, column 6 is '#', which is a wall. Oh! Wait, row 4 is \"#S   HA#\", so column 6 is '#'. So (4,5) is column 5. If we move RIGHT again, next position would be (4,6), which is a wall. So that's a problem. So moving RIGHT now would lead to a possible wall collision in the next step if we continue RIGHT.\n\nSo if we choose RIGHT now, the head moves to (4,5) (apple), which is safe. But then, in the next epoch, if we try to move RIGHT again, the head would go to (4,6), which is a wall. So that's a bad direction. So maybe better to avoid RIGHT.\n\nWhat about moving UP? After moving UP to (3,4), which is apple, then next possible directions could be UP (row 2, column 4). Let's check row 2: \"#S     #\". Column 4 in row 2 is ' ', so safe. So moving UP again is possible.\n\nAnother thing to check: Are there any other apples on the board? Let's list all 'A's.\n\nRow 3, column 4: 'A' (position (3,4))\nRow 4, column 5: 'A' (position (4,5))\nRow 6, column 6: 'A' (row 6 is \"# SSSSA#\", column 6 is 'A')\n\nSo three apples. So moving UP would eat the (3,4) apple, moving RIGHT would eat (4,5) apple.\n\nSo between UP and RIGHT, which is better. Let's check the body positions again. Let's make sure that moving UP doesn't hit the body. The head is moving to (3,4). The snake's body in row 3 is at (3,1), which is column 1, so (3,4) is far away, no collision. So that's safe.\n\nIf we choose UP, that's the current direction, so it's allowed, and it's safe. So the best direction here is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#S     #\n#S  A  #\n#S   HA#\n#SS  S #\n# SSSSA#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and safety:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 4, column 4).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is invalid as it reverses the current direction).\n- **Apples**: Located at (3,4), (4,5), and (6,6).\n- **Walls**: Board edges are walls ('#').\n\n### Analysis of Each Possible Direction:\n1. **UP**:  \n   Moving UP would take the head to (3,4), which contains an apple ('A'). This position is not a wall or part of the snake's body (body segments are at (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,5), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)). Eating this apple is safe and increases the score.\n\n2. **LEFT**:  \n   Moving LEFT would take the head to (4,3), an empty space (' '). This position is safe (no collision), but there is no apple here, so the snake does not grow.\n\n3. **RIGHT**:  \n   Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,5), which contains an apple ('A'). This position is safe (no collision). However, a subsequent RIGHT move would lead to (4,6), a wall ('#'), risking a collision in the next epoch.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is the safest and most beneficial choice. It allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and avoids immediate collision risks. \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's list out each row to get a clear picture:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #      # (so columns 1-6 are empty)\nRow 2: #      # (same, empty)\nRow 3: #S  AH # → Let's check columns 1-6 here. Column 1 is 'S', column 4 is 'A', column 5 is 'H' (head). So positions (3,1) = S, (3,4)=A, (3,5)=H.\nRow 4: #S   SA# → Column 1: S, column 4: S, column 5: A. So (4,1)=S, (4,4)=S, (4,5)=A.\nRow 5: #SS  S # → Column 1:S, column 2:S, column 5:S. (5,1)=S, (5,2)=S, (5,5)=S.\nRow 6: # SSSSA# → Column 2:S, column 3:S, column 4:S, column 5:S, column 6:A. (6,2)=S, (6,3)=S, (6,4)=S, (6,5)=S, (6,6)=A.\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake's head is at (3,5) (row 3, column 5). Since the direction is UP, the next move would be to row 2, column 5 if the direction remains UP. But we need to check possible directions the snake can turn. The snake can't reverse direction, so since current direction is UP, the snake can't go DOWN. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the snake's body positions to avoid collision. The snake's body is made of 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nFrom row 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,4)\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,2), (5,5)\nRow 6: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\nAlso, the head is (3,5) as 'H'.\n\nNow, the current direction is UP. Let's check the next positions for each possible direction:\n\n1. UP direction: The head would move to (2,5). Let's check if (2,5) is a wall or body. Row 2, column 5 is in row 2 (which is \"#      #\"), so column 5 is empty (since row 2 has columns 1-6 as spaces). So (2,5) is empty. No collision here. But are there any apples there? Let's check row 2: it's \"#      #\", so no 'A's. So moving UP would just move the head to (2,5), and the body would follow (since the snake's length increases when it eats an apple, but since no apple is eaten here, the tail would move). But the current question is about the next move's safety and possible apple consumption.\n\n2. LEFT direction: Current head is (3,5). Moving LEFT would take it to (3,4). Let's check (3,4): in row 3, the row is \"#S  AH #\". Column 4 is 'A' (since positions are 0-based: row 3, columns 0-7. So columns 0 is '#', 1 is 'S', 2 is ' ', 3 is ' ', 4 is 'A', 5 is 'H', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'). So (3,4) is 'A'! So moving LEFT would make the snake eat the apple at (3,4). That's good because it increases the score and the snake grows. Now, check if (3,4) is a body part. The body parts are all the 'S's listed earlier. (3,4) is 'A', not 'S', so no collision. So moving LEFT would be safe and get an apple.\n\n3. RIGHT direction: Moving RIGHT from (3,5) would take the head to (3,6). Let's check (3,6). Row 3 is \"#S  AH #\", column 6 is ' ' (since after 'H' (column5) is column6 which is space). So (3,6) is empty. No apple there. Check if that's a body part: no, since the body parts are in other positions. So moving RIGHT is safe but no apple.\n\n4. DOWN direction: The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is UP, so DOWN is a reverse. So direction can't be DOWN. So that's invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Now, which is best? Let's check if moving LEFT is possible. The apple is at (3,4). If we move LEFT (to (3,4)), we eat the apple. That's a good move. Now, check if there's any collision. The head would move to (3,4), which is an apple. The snake's body is currently in (3,1), (4,1), (4,4), (5,1), (5,2), (5,5), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (3,4) is not a body part, so no collision. So moving LEFT is safe and gains an apple.\n\nWhat about moving UP? The next position is (2,5). That's empty. No apple. So that's a safe move but no gain. Moving RIGHT is (3,6), also empty. So the best move is to go LEFT and eat the apple.\n\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#S  AH #\n#S   SA#\n#SS  S #\n# SSSSA#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current state:\n\n- **Snake Head Position**: (3,5) (row 3, column 5)  \n- **Current Direction**: UP (cannot reverse to DOWN)  \n- **Possible Directions**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is invalid as it reverses direction).  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **UP**: Next head position is (2,5). This cell is empty (no apple or body). Safe but no apple.  \n2. **LEFT**: Next head position is (3,4). This cell contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake. Check collision: (3,4) is not part of the snake's body (body segments are at (3,1), (4,1), (4,4), (5,1), (5,2), (5,5), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)). Safe and rewards an apple.  \n3. **RIGHT**: Next head position is (3,6). This cell is empty (no apple or body). Safe but no apple.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, which is the most beneficial action.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board.\n\nThe board is 8x8, surrounded by walls (the '#' characters). Let's parse each row from top to bottom.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #    A # → So positions (1,1) to (1,6) are ' ', ' ', ' ', 'A', ' ' (assuming 0-based indexing, row 1, columns 1 to 6)\nRow 2: #      # → All spaces except walls.\nRow 3: #S  HS # → Let's break this down. Columns 1 to 6: 'S', ' ', ' ', 'H', 'S', ' ' → So positions (3,1) is 'S', (3,4) is 'H', (3,5) is 'S'\nRow 4: #S   SA# → Columns 1-6: 'S', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'S', 'A' → (4,1) 'S', (4,5) 'S', (4,6) 'A' (since the row ends with #, so column 6 is 'A')\nRow 5: #SS  S # → Columns 1-6: 'S', 'S', ' ', ' ', 'S', ' ' → (5,1) 'S', (5,2) 'S', (5,5) 'S'\nRow 6: # SSSSA# → Columns 1-6: ' ', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'A' → (6,1) ' ', (6,2) 'S', (6,3) 'S', (6,4) 'S', (6,5) 'S', (6,6) 'A'\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the snake's head is at (3,4) since that's the 'H'. The current direction is LEFT. Since the snake is moving LEFT, the next position the head would move to is (3,3) (since moving left decreases the column index by 1).\n\nNow, I need to check if moving in the current direction (LEFT) would cause a collision. Let's see where (3,3) is. Looking at row 3, column 3 (0-based, so 3rd column), which in row 3 is the 4th character (since columns start at 0). Row 3 is \"#S  HS #\", so the characters are [ '#', 'S', ' ', ' ', 'H', 'S', ' ' ] (columns 0 to 6). So column 3 (index 3) is ' ', which is empty. So moving LEFT to (3,3) is safe. But wait, what about the rest of the snake's body?\n\nThe snake's body is all the 'S's. Let's list all the 'S' positions:\n\nRow 3: (3,1), (3,5)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,5)\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,2), (5,5)\nRow 6: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo (3,3) is a space, not a wall or 'S', so moving LEFT here is okay. But maybe there's an apple there? Let's check. The apples are 'A's. Let's list all 'A's:\n\nRow 1: (1,4) → 'A'\nRow 4: (4,6) → 'A' (since row 4 is \"#S   SA#\", so column 6 is 'A')\nRow 6: (6,6) → 'A' (row 6 is \"# SSSSA#\", column 6 is 'A')\n\nSo (3,3) is not an apple. So if the snake moves LEFT, it will just move to (3,3), and the body will follow. The previous head position (3,4) becomes 'S', and the new head is (3,3).\n\nBut wait, the current direction is LEFT. The player can choose a new direction, but the snake can't reverse direction. Since the current direction is LEFT, the snake can't immediately turn RIGHT (reverse). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.\n\nWe need to choose a direction that avoids collision and ideally gets to an apple. Let's check the possible directions.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,4). Let's list possible next positions for each direction:\n\n- LEFT: (3,3) → as before, which is empty.\n- RIGHT: (3,5) → (3,5) is 'S' (from row 3: #S  HS # → column 5 is 'S'). So moving RIGHT would make the head go into its own body → collision, game over. So RIGHT is invalid.\n- UP: (2,4). Let's check (2,4). Row 2 is \"#      #\", which is all spaces. So (2,4) is ' '.\n- DOWN: (4,4). Let's check row 4, column 4. Row 4 is \"#S   SA#\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: 'A'. So (4,4) is ' ', which is empty.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. (RIGHT is invalid because it's reverse of LEFT? Wait, no: the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is LEFT. Reverse would be RIGHT. So the snake can't turn RIGHT. So RIGHT is invalid as a direction input, because you can't reverse. So possible directions are LEFT (current direction), UP, or DOWN.\n\nSo the player can choose LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\nNow, we need to check which direction is best. Let's see where the apples are. The apples are at (1,4), (4,6), (6,6).\n\nCurrent head is at (3,4). Let's see the positions:\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT (to 3,3), next step, direction can be changed again. But perhaps moving towards apples.\n\nApple at (1,4) is in row 1, column 4. So that's above the current head (row 3, column 4). So moving UP would go towards (2,4), then maybe (1,4) which is the apple. Let's check if moving UP is possible.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. If we choose UP, the snake will turn UP. So the next head position is (3,4) + UP → (2,4). Let's check (2,4): row 2, column 4 is ' ', so safe.\n\nIf the snake moves UP, then the next position is (2,4). Then, perhaps next move could be UP again towards (1,4) which is the apple. That would be good. Because (1,4) is an apple. So if the snake can reach (1,4), it would eat the apple, grow, and score increases.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN? Head moves to (4,4). Then, row 4, column 4 is ' '. Then, perhaps moving towards (4,6) which is an apple. (4,6) is column 6. So from (4,4), moving RIGHT (if possible) would get to (4,5) (which is 'S' in row 4, column 5), then (4,6). But (4,5) is 'S', so moving RIGHT from (4,4) to (4,5) would hit the body.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (4,4) to (5,4). Let's check (5,4). Row 5 is \"#SS  S #\", columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ' → (5,4) is ' ', so safe. Then, maybe moving towards (6,6) apple. But that's a bit further.\n\nThe apple at (1,4) is directly above. Let's see the path:\n\nCurrent head: (3,4). If direction is UP, next head (2,4). Then, next direction could be UP again (since current direction would be UP), moving to (1,4), which is the apple. That's perfect. Because (1,4) is an apple. So if we choose UP now, then in the next step (epoch 46), the snake's head would be at (2,4). Then, in epoch 47, if we choose UP again, head moves to (1,4) where the apple is. Then, the snake eats the apple, grows, and the score increases.\n\nSo choosing UP now is a good move. Let's confirm the movement.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. If we input UP, the snake changes direction to UP (since it's allowed; can't reverse, but UP is not reverse of LEFT). So the next movement is UP. The head moves from (3,4) to (2,4). Let's check (2,4): yes, it's a space. So that's safe.\n\nWhat about moving LEFT? The head moves to (3,3). Then, what's around (3,3)? Let's see, row 3, column 3 is ' ', but then the next move could be towards other directions. But (3,3) is not near any apples. The apples are at (1,4), (4,6), (6,6). So moving LEFT might not lead towards an apple quickly.\n\nMoving DOWN: head to (4,4). Then, (4,4) is a space. Then, next possible directions (current direction would be DOWN). Let's see, (4,4) is in row 4, column 4. The apple at (4,6) is two columns to the right. But (4,5) is 'S' (from row 4: #S   SA# → column 5 is 'S'), so moving right from (4,4) to (4,5) would hit the body. So that's not safe.\n\nSo the best option is to move UP towards the apple at (1,4).\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#S  HS #\n#S   SA#\n#SS  S #\n# SSSSA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3,4) (row 3, column 4), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot choose RIGHT. The possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (3,3), which is an empty space (safe but not near an apple).  \n- **RIGHT**: Invalid (reverse of current direction).  \n- **UP**: Moving up would take the head to (2,4), which is an empty space (safe). This direction moves the head toward the apple at (1,4) (row 1, column 4), a direct path to an apple.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (4,4), which is an empty space (safe but not directly toward an apple).  \n\nThe optimal choice is UP, as it positions the snake to reach the apple at (1,4) in the next move. \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#   H  #\n#   SS #\n#S   SA#\n#SS  S #\n# SSSSA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and we're at epoch 46. The snake can't reverse direction, so from UP, the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP (since reversing to DOWN is not allowed).\n\nFirst, let's map out the snake's body and head. The head is 'H' in the second row (since the first row is the top wall). Let's index rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7). Columns from left (column 0) to right (column 7).\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7 are all #)\nRow 1: #    A # → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'A', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 2: #   H  # → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 3: #   SS # → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 4: #S   SA# → columns 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: 'A', 7: #\nRow 5: #SS  S # → columns 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: #\nRow 6: # SSSSA# → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'A', 7: #\nRow 7: ######## \n\nSo the head 'H' is at (row 2, column 3). Current direction is UP, which means the next move would be to row 1, column 3 (since moving up decreases the row number). Let's check where that cell is.\n\nRow 1, column 3: in row 1, columns 0-7 are #, ' ', ' ', ' ', 'A', ' ', ' ', #. So column 3 is ' ' (empty). So if we move UP, the head would go to (1,3). Then, the snake's body would follow. Since the current length: let's count the 'S's and 'H' (H is 1, S's are body). Let's count S's:\n\nRow 2: H (1)\nRow 3: SS (2)\nRow 4: S (1) and S (1) → 2\nRow 5: SS (2) and S (1) → 3\nRow 6: SSSS (4)\nTotal S's: 2+2+3+4=11? Wait, let's count each S:\n\nRow 3: columns 3 and 4 are S → 2 S's\nRow 4: column 1 (S) and column 5 (S) → 2 S's\nRow 5: column 1 (S), column 2 (S), column 5 (S) → 3 S's\nRow 6: column 2 (S), 3 (S), 4 (S), 5 (S) → 4 S's\nSo total S's: 2+2+3+4=11. Head is 1, so total length is 12. So when moving, the head moves, and the body follows. So the tail (last S) would be removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nNow, possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since current direction is UP, can't go DOWN). Let's check each possible direction's outcome.\n\n1. Direction UP:\nHead moves from (2,3) to (1,3). Check if (1,3) is a wall or body. (1,3) is ' ', so safe. The cell (1,3) is empty (no apple). So the snake moves: the head is now at (1,3), and the body shifts. The previous head (2,3) becomes S, and the tail (the last S) is removed. Let's see the tail: the snake's body is a chain. Since the snake was moving UP, the body parts follow the path. Let's track the body. The current head is at (2,3). The next part of the body (since moving UP) would be the cell the head was previously in. Wait, the snake's movement: each step, the head moves in the direction, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the body's positions are the previous positions of the head and each segment. So the body is ordered such that the first S after the head is the previous head position, then the next S is the position before that, etc.\n\nBut perhaps a better way: when moving UP, the new head is (1,3). The previous head (2,3) becomes S. Then the rest of the body shifts. The body in row 3, columns 3 and 4 (SS) would move up. The first S (row 3, col3) was the position before the head (2,3) when the head was moving. Let's think of the snake's path. Let's assume the snake's movement history. Current direction is UP, so previous direction was also UP (since epoch 46, maybe it's been moving up). The head was at (3,3) in the previous step, then moved up to (2,3) (current head). Then, the body segments would be (3,3) (now S), (3,4) (next S), etc. So when moving UP again, the new head is (1,3), the previous head (2,3) becomes S, the next segment (3,3) moves to (2,3) (but that's now the new S from the head), so perhaps I need to track the body positions in order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the body is a list of coordinates. Let's list all the S and H positions:\n\nH is at (2,3)\nS positions:\nRow 3: (3,3), (3,4)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,5)\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,2), (5,5)\nRow 6: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo total body positions (excluding H): 2 (row3) + 2 (row4) +3 (row5) +4 (row6) = 11. So the snake's length is 12 (H + 11 S's). When moving, the head moves to new position, and each body part takes the position of the previous part. The tail (last S) is removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nIf we move UP to (1,3):\n\n- New head position: (1,3). Check if it's a wall (no, row 1 is within 0-7, column 3 is within 0-7). Check if it's a body part. The body parts are (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,5), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (1,3) is not in any of these, so safe. No apple here (row 1, column 3 is ' '). So after moving, the snake's new positions are:\n\nH at (1,3)\nBody segments: (2,3) (old H), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,5), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\nTail (6,5) is removed (since no apple eaten). So the new body would have 11 segments (since length remains 12, as no apple). The new board would have (6,5) as empty (since tail is removed).\n\n2. Direction LEFT:\nCurrent head is at (2,3). Moving LEFT would mean column 3 → 2. So new head position (2,2). Check if that's a wall: row 2, column 2 is ' ' (from row 2: #   H  # → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', etc. So column 2 is ' '). Check if (2,2) is a body part. Current body parts: (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,5), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (2,2) is not in these, so safe. Check for apple: (2,2) is ' ', so no apple. So moving LEFT would be safe. The new head is (2,2), body shifts. Tail (6,5) is removed.\n\n3. Direction RIGHT:\nHead moves from (2,3) to (2,4). Check row 2, column 4: in row 2, it's ' ' (since row 2 is #   H  # → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #). So (2,4) is ' '. Check if (2,4) is a body part. Current body parts: none are (2,4), so safe. No apple here. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nNow, we need to check if any of these directions lead to apples. Let's look for apples on the board. The apples are 'A's. Let's list their positions:\n\nRow 1, column 4: (1,4) → 'A'\nRow 4, column 6: (4,6) → 'A'\nRow 6, column 6: (6,6) → 'A'\n\nSo there are 3 apples. Let's see where each direction would take the head next step (epoch 47). The goal is to eat apples. Let's see if any direction leads the head towards an apple.\n\nCurrent head is (2,3). Let's check possible next steps and then possible future steps.\n\nIf we move UP to (1,3), then next possible directions (since new direction would be UP, can't go DOWN). From (1,3), next move could be UP (row 0, which is a wall, so game over), LEFT (row 1, column 2), RIGHT (row 1, column 4 → which is an apple!). Oh! Because (1,4) is an apple. So if we move UP now (epoch 46), the head is at (1,3). Then, in epoch 47, the direction could be RIGHT (since current direction would be UP, so next direction can be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP). If we choose RIGHT in epoch 47, the head would move to (1,4), which is the apple. That would be good. But we need to decide the direction for epoch 46. So moving UP now would position the head to be one step away from the apple at (1,4).\n\nIf we move RIGHT now (epoch 46) to (2,4), then next possible directions (current direction would be RIGHT, so can't go LEFT). Then, possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Let's see where (2,4) is. From (2,4), moving RIGHT would go to (2,5), which is empty. Moving UP to (1,4) (the apple!). Oh, (1,4) is the apple. So if we move RIGHT in epoch 46, the head is at (2,4). Then in epoch 47, direction UP would take us to (1,4), which is the apple. That's even better! Because moving RIGHT now, then UP next step would get the apple.\n\nWait, let's check: moving RIGHT in epoch 46, head moves to (2,4). Then, in epoch 47, the current direction would be RIGHT (since we moved RIGHT in epoch 46). So the allowed directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (can't reverse to LEFT). So if in epoch 47, we choose UP, that's allowed (since direction is RIGHT, turning UP is allowed). Then the head would move from (2,4) to (1,4), which is the apple. That would eat the apple, increase the score, and the snake grows (so the tail isn't removed). That's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, if we move UP in epoch 46 to (1,3), then in epoch 47, the current direction is UP. So allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, UP. If we choose RIGHT, the head moves to (1,4) (the apple), which is also good.\n\nSo both UP and RIGHT could lead to eating the apple next step. What about moving LEFT? If we move LEFT to (2,2) in epoch 46. Then, in epoch 47, direction is LEFT (since we moved LEFT). Allowed directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Let's see (2,2) is the new head. From there, moving UP would be (1,2), which is empty. Moving LEFT would be (2,1), which is empty. Not near any apples. So moving LEFT might not be as good.\n\nNow, check if any direction leads to immediate collision. All three directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe. So the best is to choose a direction that allows reaching an apple next step.\n\nLet's compare the two options (UP and RIGHT) for epoch 46.\n\nIf we move UP to (1,3), then in epoch 47, direction RIGHT to (1,4) (apple). That's possible.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (2,4), then in epoch 47, direction UP to (1,4) (apple). That's also possible.\n\nWhich is better? Let's check if moving RIGHT now (epoch 46) to (2,4) is safe. The cell (2,4) is empty. Then, in epoch 47, moving UP to (1,4) (apple) is safe. Because (1,4) is an apple, not a body or wall.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (1,3) (epoch 46), then moving RIGHT (epoch 47) to (1,4) (apple) is also safe.\n\nBut let's check the current body positions to see if there are any possible collisions in the next steps.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT (epoch 46), head at (2,4). The body would shift. The new body positions would be:\n\nH: (2,4)\nBody segments: (2,3) (old H), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,5), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\nTail (6,5) is removed (since no apple eaten). So (6,5) becomes empty.\n\nThen, in epoch 47, moving UP to (1,4) (apple). Check (1,4) is apple, so the snake eats it. The snake's length increases by 1 (so tail is not removed). The new head is (1,4). The body would be:\n\nH: (1,4)\nBody segments: (2,4) (old H), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,5), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\nTail remains (since apple eaten, so no removal). So that's safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving UP (epoch 46) to (1,3), then RIGHT (epoch 47) to (1,4) (apple) would also work.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT now (epoch 46) is better because (2,4) is in a position that's more central, and (1,4) is the apple. Let's confirm the positions again.\n\nOriginal apple positions: (1,4), (4,6), (6,6).\n\nAnother apple is at (4,6). Let's see where that is. (4,6) is row 4, column 6. The current head is (2,3). To reach (4,6), the snake would need to move down and right. But perhaps that's further away. The closest apple is (1,4), which is two steps away (if moving RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT).\n\nSo between UP and RIGHT, which direction is better? Let's see if moving UP now would cause a wall collision in the next step. If after moving UP (epoch 46) to (1,3), the next move (epoch 47) could be UP again to (0,3), which is a wall (row 0 is all #). So that's a problem. So if we move UP in epoch 46, and then in epoch 47, if we mistakenly choose UP again, we hit the wall. But the player can choose direction, so the player would avoid that. So the player would choose RIGHT in epoch 47.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT in epoch 46 to (2,4), then in epoch 47, moving UP to (1,4) (apple). That's a safe path. So moving RIGHT now (epoch 46) allows reaching the apple in the next step without risk of wall collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP in epoch 46, then RIGHT in epoch 47: (1,3) → (1,4) (apple). That's also safe, but (1,3) is in row 1, which is close to the top wall. So if the snake continues moving up from (1,3), it would hit the wall. But the player can choose to turn right, which is better.\n\nSo both directions are possible. But perhaps moving RIGHT is better because (2,4) is a more central position, and the next move up to the apple is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if there's any other apple that's closer. The other apples are at (4,6) and (6,6). Let's see (4,6) is in row 4, column 6. The head is at (2,3). The distance to (4,6) is (4-2) = 2 rows down, (6-3)=3 columns right. So 5 steps. (6,6) is row 6, column 6: (6-2)=4 rows down, (6-3)=3 columns right. 7 steps. So the closest is (1,4), which is 1 row up, 1 column right from current head (2,3) → that's two steps (either up then right, or right then up).\n\nSo the best strategy is to move towards (1,4). Between the two options (UP then RIGHT, or RIGHT then UP), which is possible.\n\nIf we move RIGHT now (epoch 46), the head goes to (2,4). Then, in epoch 47, direction UP (allowed, since current direction would be RIGHT, so can turn UP) → (1,4), which is the apple. That would eat the apple. So this is a valid path.\n\nIf we move UP now (epoch 46), head goes to (1,3). Then, in epoch 47, direction RIGHT (allowed, since current direction is UP, can turn RIGHT) → (1,4), apple. Also valid.\n\nSo which direction to choose? Let's see if moving RIGHT now (epoch 46) to (2,4) is possible. (2,4) is empty. The body is not there. So safe.\n\nYes, moving RIGHT is a valid direction and leads to the apple in the next step. So I think the best direction is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#   H  #\n#   SS #\n#S   SA#\n#SS  S #\n# SSSSA#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current position, possible moves, and apple locations. The snake's head ('H') is at (row 2, column 3), moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid), leaving UP, LEFT, or RIGHT as options.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (row 1, column 4), (row 4, column 6), and (row 6, column 6). The closest apple is at (1, 4), 1 row up and 1 column right from the head.\n2. **Possible Moves**:\n   - **UP**: Head moves to (1, 3). This is safe (no wall\/body collision) but leaves the head adjacent to the top wall, risking future collisions if not turned.\n   - **LEFT**: Head moves to (2, 2). This is safe but does not position the snake closer to any apple.\n   - **RIGHT**: Head moves to (2, 4). This is safe and positions the head one step away from the apple at (1, 4). From (2, 4), the next move UP (allowed, as direction can change from RIGHT to UP) would reach the apple (1, 4) in the next epoch.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT positions the snake to reach the nearest apple in the next epoch, maximizing score growth while avoiding immediate risks.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by parsing the board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' walls. Let's list out each row to see where the snake (H, S) and apples (A) are.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #    A # → positions 1-6: indexes 1 is #, 2-4 are spaces, 5 is A, 6 is space, 7 is #\nRow 2: #   SH # → positions 1: #, 2-3: spaces, 4: S, 5: H, 6: space, 7: #. So the head (H) is at (2,5) [row 2, column 5, if rows start at 0].\nRow 3: #   SS # → positions 1: #, 2-3: spaces, 4: S, 5: S, 6: space, 7: #. So (3,4) and (3,5) are S.\nRow 4: #    SA# → positions 1: #, 2-3: spaces, 4: space, 5: S, 6: A, 7: #. So (4,5) is S, (4,6) is A.\nRow 5: #SS  S # → positions 1: #, 2: S, 3: S, 4: space, 5: space, 6: S, 7: #. So (5,2), (5,3), (5,6) are S.\nRow 6: # SSSSA# → positions 1: #, 2: space, 3: S, 4: S, 5: S, 6: S, 7: A, 8: #? Wait, row 6 is 8 characters. Let's count: index 0 is #, 1: space, 2: S, 3: S, 4: S, 5: S, 6: A, 7: #. So (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) are S, (6,6) is A.\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right. The head is at (2,5). Let's confirm the snake's body segments. Since the snake moves in the current direction, the body follows. The head was previously moving right, so the next position would be (2,6) if direction remains RIGHT. Let's check the current body positions.\n\nLet's list all S and H positions:\n\nH is at (2,5).\n\nOther S positions:\nRow 2, column 4: (2,4)\nRow 3, column 4: (3,4)\nRow 3, column 5: (3,5)\nRow 4, column 5: (4,5)\nRow 5, column 2: (5,2)\nRow 5, column 3: (5,3)\nRow 5, column 6: (5,6)\nRow 6, column 2: (6,2)\nRow 6, column 3: (6,3)\nRow 6, column 4: (6,4)\nRow 6, column 5: (6,5)\n\nSo the snake's body is in these positions. Now, the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is RIGHT. Reversing would be LEFT, which is not allowed. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since reversing is only when the new direction is opposite). Wait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, the example says that if current direction is UP, you can't go DOWN. So if current direction is RIGHT, you can't go LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since LEFT is opposite).\n\nNow, the snake's head is at (2,5). Let's check possible next positions based on direction:\n\n- RIGHT: next head position is (2,6). Let's check what's there. Row 2 is \"#   SH #\", so column 6 is a space (since row 2 is #, then three spaces (columns 1,2,3), then S (4), H (5), space (6), # (7). So (2,6) is a space. So moving RIGHT would take head to (2,6), which is empty. Then the body would follow. But need to check if that's a valid move (not hitting walls or self). The walls are at column 0 and 7 (since rows are 0-7, columns 0-7). (2,6) is column 6, which is within 0-7 (since 7 is the wall). So 6 is safe. Then, the next position is safe.\n\n- UP: current direction is RIGHT. UP is allowed (not opposite). The head is at (2,5). Moving UP would take it to (1,5). Let's check (1,5). Row 1 is \"#    A #\", which is columns 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: space, 5: A, 6: space, 7: #. So (1,5) is an apple (A). So moving UP would make the snake eat the apple. That's good. Then the snake would grow. The new head is (1,5), and since it ate an apple, the body doesn't shrink (since when you eat an apple, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move). So this is a good move because it gets an apple.\n\n- DOWN: direction is RIGHT, so DOWN is allowed. Head at (2,5) moving down to (3,5). Let's check (3,5). Row 3 is \"#   SS #\", so column 5 is S (since row 3: #, space, space, space, S (4), S (5), space, #). So (3,5) is S. That's the snake's own body. So moving DOWN would cause a collision with self, which ends the game. So that's bad.\n\nSo possible directions: RIGHT (safe, no apple), UP (safe, apple), DOWN (collision). So the best choice is UP, which gets an apple. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head is (2,5). Moving UP to (1,5), which is A. So the snake eats the apple. The new head is (1,5). The body will grow, so the previous head (2,5) becomes S, and the rest of the body follows. So this is a valid move that increases the score. So the direction to choose is UP.\n\n\n########\n#    A #\n#   SH #\n#   SS #\n#    SA#\n#SS  S #\n# SSSSA#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The head (H) is at (row 2, column 5). The body (S) occupies multiple positions, including (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,2), (5,3), (5,6), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\n2. **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Valid options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n3. **Next Positions Check**:\n   - **RIGHT**: Head moves to (2,6). This is an empty space (no collision), but no apple is present here.\n   - **DOWN**: Head moves to (3,5). This position is occupied by the snake’s own body (S), causing a collision (game over).\n   - **UP**: Head moves to (1,5). This position contains an apple (A). Eating the apple increases the score and allows the snake to grow safely.\n\nThe only safe and beneficial move is UP, as it avoids collision and collects an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body segments are 'S', and apples are 'A'. The current direction is UP, and the epoch is 48 (so we have 52 epochs left before the game ends at 100). The snake can't reverse direction, so from UP, the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (since DOWN would be reversing).\n\nFirst, let's map out the positions of the head, body, apples, and walls. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #    H # → Let's index columns 0-7. So row 1, column 4 is 'H' (since spaces are 0-based: columns 0 is '#', 1-3 are ' ', 4 is 'H', 5 is ' ', 6 is '#', 7 is '#')? Wait, let's check each row properly.\n\nRow 1: \"#    H #\" → positions (row 1, columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: '#', 7: '#'? Wait, 8 characters per row. Let's split each row into 8 columns (0-7):\n\nRow 0: columns 0-7: # # # # # # # # → all walls.\nRow 1: columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: '#', 7: '#' → So H is at (1,4).\nRow 2: #   SS # → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: '#', 7: '#' → So (2,3) and (2,4) are 'S'.\nRow 3: # A SS # → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: '#', 7: '#' → (3,2) is 'A'; (3,4), (3,5) are 'S'.\nRow 4: #    SA# → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'A', 6: '#', 7: '#' → (4,4) is 'S'; (4,5) is 'A'.\nRow 5: #SS  S # → columns 0: #, 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: '#', 7: '#' → (5,1), (5,2), (5,5) are 'S'.\nRow 6: # SSSSA# → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'A', 7: '#' → (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) are 'S'; (6,6) is 'A'.\nRow 7: ######## → all walls.\n\nSo the head (H) is at (row 1, column 4). The current direction is UP. Since the snake is moving UP, the next position the head would move to is (row 0, column 4). But row 0 is a wall (all '#'), so moving UP would cause a collision with the wall. That's bad because the game ends if the snake hits the wall. So UP is not a valid direction here. So we can't choose UP.\n\nNow, the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Wait, the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. The current direction is UP, so reversing would be DOWN. So can we turn DOWN? Let's confirm: the snake's movement direction can be changed to any direction except the reverse. So if current direction is UP, the snake can turn LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP. Turning DOWN would be reversing (since the opposite of UP is DOWN), so that's not allowed. Wait, the example in the problem statement says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So, if current direction is UP, you can't turn to DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. But UP leads to a wall, as we saw. So the possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check where LEFT and RIGHT would take the head.\n\nCurrent head position: (1,4).\n\nIf direction is LEFT: moving left (column decreases by 1), so new head position is (1,3). Need to check if that's a wall, snake body, or apple.\n\nCheck (1,3): row 1, column 3. Looking at row 1: \"#    H #\", columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: ' ', 6: '#', 7: '#'. So (1,3) is a space. So that's safe. What's in that cell? It's empty (no 'S' or 'A' there). So moving LEFT would take the head to (1,3), which is safe. Then, the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is determined by the number of 'S' plus the 'H'. Let's count the current body:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: H (head)\nRow 2: SS → (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: SS → (3,4), (3,5)\nRow 4: S → (4,4)\nRow 5: SS (5,1,2), S (5,5)\nRow 6: SSSS (6,2-5)\nSo total S's: Let's count.\n\nRow 2: 2 S's.\nRow 3: 2 S's.\nRow 4: 1 S.\nRow 5: 3 S's (columns 1,2,5).\nRow 6: 4 S's (columns 2-5).\nTotal S's: 2+2+1+3+4=12. So the snake's length is 1 (head) + 12 (body) = 13. When moving, the snake moves the head to the new position, and the body follows (each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment). If the head moves to a cell with an apple, the snake grows (so the tail doesn't move; the new head is added, and the body increases by 1).\n\nNow, check direction RIGHT: moving right (column increases by 1). New head position is (1,5). Let's check that cell. Row 1, column 5: row 1 is \"#    H #\", so column 5 is ' ' (since H is at 4, then 5 is space, 6 is #). So (1,5) is a space. Safe. No collision here.\n\nSo both LEFT (1,3) and RIGHT (1,5) are possible. Now, we need to see if moving in either direction leads to an apple, or avoids collision in the next steps. Also, the snake's goal is to eat as many apples as possible. Let's check where the apples are.\n\nApples are 'A's. Let's list their positions:\n\nRow 3, column 2: (3,2) → 'A'\nRow 4, column 5: (4,5) → 'A'\nRow 6, column 6: (6,6) → 'A'\n\nSo there are 3 apples left.\n\nThe head is at (1,4). Let's see which direction (LEFT or RIGHT) would get the snake closer to an apple.\n\nIf moving LEFT to (1,3), the next possible moves. Let's think about the snake's body positions. The current body is a chain. The head is at (1,4). The next body segment (since the snake is moving UP, the previous position before the head would be (2,4), because when moving UP, the head was at (2,4) before moving to (1,4). Let's confirm: the current direction is UP, so the previous head position (before moving to current head) would be (2,4). Because moving UP from (2,4) to (1,4) (current head). So the body segments follow. So the body after the head is (2,4), then (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (5,5), (5,2), (5,1), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) — perhaps. But maybe I should track the body's order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the body segments are arranged in the order of movement. Let's think: the snake's body is a sequence. The head is first, then each body segment follows. When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the body's positions are the previous positions of the head.\n\nAssuming that, the current head is at (1,4). The previous position (when moving UP) would have been (2,4) (since moving UP from (2,4) to (1,4)). So the first body segment (immediately behind the head) is at (2,4). Then, the next body segment would be where the previous position of (2,4) was. Let's see: the row 2 has \" #   SS # \" → (2,3) and (2,4) are S. So (2,4) is the first body segment (behind the head), (2,3) is next. Then row 3 has \" # A SS # \" → (3,4) and (3,5) are S. So (3,4) comes after (2,3), then (3,5). Then row 4 has \" #    SA# \" → (4,4) is S. So (4,4) comes after (3,5). Then row 5 has \" #SS  S # \" → (5,1), (5,2), (5,5) are S. So (5,5) comes after (4,4), then (5,2), (5,1). Then row 6 has \" # SSSSA# \" → (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) are S. So (6,1) is not, (6,2) comes after (5,1), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Then (6,6) is A.\n\nSo the body sequence is:\n\nHead: (1,4)\n\nBody 1: (2,4)\n\nBody 2: (2,3)\n\nBody 3: (3,4)\n\nBody 4: (3,5)\n\nBody 5: (4,4)\n\nBody 6: (5,5)\n\nBody 7: (5,2)\n\nBody 8: (5,1)\n\nBody 9: (6,2)\n\nBody 10: (6,3)\n\nBody 11: (6,4)\n\nBody 12: (6,5)\n\nSo that's 12 body segments, making the total length 13.\n\nNow, if the snake moves LEFT (direction LEFT), the new head position is (1,3). Let's check if (1,3) is a body segment. The current body segments are (2,4), (2,3), (3,4), etc. (1,3) is not in the body positions, so that's safe. Then, after moving LEFT, the new head is (1,3), and the body segments shift: Body 1 (2,4) moves to (1,4), Body 2 (2,3) moves to (2,4), Body 3 (3,4) moves to (2,3), and so on. The tail (Body 12: (6,5)) would move to (6,4) (assuming the snake didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves forward).\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT (direction RIGHT), the new head position is (1,5). Check if (1,5) is a body segment. Current body segments are (2,4), (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (5,5), etc. (1,5) is not a body segment, so that's safe. Then the body shifts: Body 1 (2,4) moves to (1,4), Body 2 (2,3) moves to (2,4), Body 3 (3,4) moves to (2,3), Body 4 (3,5) moves to (3,4), Body 5 (4,4) moves to (3,5), Body 6 (5,5) moves to (4,4), Body 7 (5,2) moves to (5,5), Body 8 (5,1) moves to (5,2), Body 9 (6,2) moves to (5,1), Body 10 (6,3) moves to (6,2), Body 11 (6,4) moves to (6,3), Body 12 (6,5) moves to (6,4). So the tail (Body 12) would move to (6,4), and the previous tail position (6,5) is now Body 11's new position.\n\nNow, are there any apples in the next possible moves? Let's see where the apples are. The apples are at (3,2), (4,5), (6,6).\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT to (1,3), the next move possibilities. Let's think about where the snake can go next. The next direction would depend on the new current direction. If the snake turns LEFT, the current direction becomes LEFT, so next possible directions would be UP, DOWN (but can't reverse, so from LEFT, can't go RIGHT). Wait, the movement direction is whatever direction the player inputs, as long as it's not reversing. So after moving LEFT, the current direction is LEFT, so the next direction can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing would be RIGHT).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction after moving is the direction the player chose. For example, if the current direction is UP, and the player chooses LEFT, then the new direction is LEFT, so the next movement is in the LEFT direction unless another direction is chosen (as long as it's not reversing).\n\nBut perhaps the direction the snake is moving is the direction of the last input. So if the current direction is UP, and the player inputs LEFT, then the snake's new direction is LEFT, and next movement is LEFT unless another direction is chosen (as long as it's not the reverse of LEFT, which is RIGHT).\n\nBut for the current decision, we need to choose a direction (LEFT or RIGHT) that allows the snake to avoid collision and reach apples.\n\nLet's check if moving LEFT or RIGHT leads to an apple in the next step. The current head is at (1,4). Moving LEFT to (1,3): that cell is empty (no A). Moving RIGHT to (1,5): that cell is empty (no A). So neither direction immediately gets an apple.\n\nNow, let's look at possible paths. Let's consider the walls. The snake is in row 1 (second row from top). The top wall is row 0, so row 1 is adjacent to the top wall. The snake is at (1,4). If the snake moves LEFT, to (1,3), then possible next moves could be UP (but row 0 is wall), so can't. Or LEFT again (to (1,2)), or DOWN (to (2,3)). Let's check (2,3): that's a body segment (current body 2 is at (2,3)), so if the snake moves DOWN from (1,3) (direction DOWN), then the new head position would be (2,3), which is a body segment → collision. So that's bad. So if we move LEFT, next possible directions could be LEFT (to (1,2)) or UP (invalid), or DOWN (which would hit body).\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (1,5), next possible directions: RIGHT (to (1,6)), which is a wall (row 1, column 6 is '#') → collision. So moving RIGHT again would hit the wall. Alternatively, direction DOWN (from RIGHT, can we turn DOWN? The current direction after moving RIGHT would be RIGHT. So the snake can't reverse direction (reverse of RIGHT is LEFT). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. If direction is DOWN, moving down from (1,5) to (2,5). Let's check (2,5): row 2 is \"#   SS #\", column 5 is ' ' (since row 2 has SS at (2,3), (2,4), column 5 is space). So (2,5) is safe. Then, the next position would be (2,5). Then, perhaps moving towards apples.\n\nLooking at the apple positions: (3,2), (4,5), (6,6). The apple at (4,5) is in row 4, column 5. If the snake is moving towards (4,5), that's a possible target. Let's see: (1,5) → (2,5) → (3,5) (current body 4 is at (3,5) → if the snake moves down from (2,5) to (3,5), that's a body segment → collision. Oh, right! (3,5) is a body segment (row 3 has \" # A SS # \" → (3,4) and (3,5) are S). So (3,5) is S. So moving down from (2,5) to (3,5) would hit the body. That's bad.\n\nWhat about the apple at (6,6)? That's in row 6, column 6. To get there, the snake would need to move down. Let's see the path from (1,4) moving RIGHT to (1,5). Then possible direction DOWN to (2,5). (2,5) is safe. Then, direction DOWN again to (3,5) → but (3,5) is S → collision. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother apple is at (3,2). Let's see the path to (3,2). The head is at (1,4). If the snake moves LEFT to (1,3), then direction DOWN to (2,3). (2,3) is S (current body 2 is at (2,3)) → collision. So that's bad. Alternatively, moving LEFT again to (1,2). Then direction DOWN to (2,2). (2,2) is ' ' (row 2 is \"#   SS #\", column 2 is ' '). So (2,2) is safe. Then direction DOWN to (3,2), which is the apple! Oh, that's a good path. Let's walk through that:\n\nCurrent head (1,4) → move LEFT to (1,3) (direction LEFT). Then, next move could be LEFT again (direction LEFT) to (1,2). Then, direction DOWN (since current direction is LEFT, so can turn DOWN (not reversing LEFT, which is RIGHT)). So moving DOWN from (1,2) to (2,2) (safe). Then, direction DOWN again to (3,2) (which is the apple at (3,2)). So eating that apple would increase the score. That's a possible path.\n\nLet's check if that path is possible. Let's outline the steps:\n\nEpoch 48: current head (1,4), direction UP. Player chooses LEFT. New head (1,3), direction becomes LEFT. Body shifts: (2,4) → (1,4), (2,3) → (2,4), (3,4) → (2,3), (3,5) → (3,4), (4,4) → (3,5), (5,5) → (4,4), (5,2) → (5,5), (5,1) → (5,2), (6,2) → (5,1), (6,3) → (6,2), (6,4) → (6,3), (6,5) → (6,4). Tail was (6,5) → now (6,4). So new body positions after moving LEFT:\n\nHead: (1,3)\n\nBody 1: (1,4)\n\nBody 2: (2,4)\n\nBody 3: (2,3)\n\nBody 4: (3,4)\n\nBody 5: (3,5)\n\nBody 6: (4,4)\n\nBody 7: (5,5)\n\nBody 8: (5,2)\n\nBody 9: (5,1)\n\nBody 10: (6,2)\n\nBody 11: (6,3)\n\nBody 12: (6,4)\n\nSo in epoch 49, the direction is LEFT. Now, the player can choose direction LEFT again (since current direction is LEFT, can't reverse to RIGHT). So moving LEFT again would take the head to (1,2). Check (1,2): row 1, column 2 is ' ' (safe). Then, body shifts again. Epoch 50: head (1,2), direction LEFT.\n\nThen, in epoch 50, the player can choose direction DOWN (since current direction is LEFT, so possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT). Choosing DOWN would move the head to (2,2). Check (2,2): row 2, column 2 is ' ' (safe). Then, body shifts. Epoch 51: head (2,2), direction DOWN.\n\nThen, in epoch 51, the player can choose direction DOWN again (current direction is DOWN; possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN). Moving DOWN to (3,2). (3,2) is the apple 'A'! So the snake would eat the apple, grow in length, and the score increases by 1. That's a good move.\n\nSo moving LEFT now allows the snake to reach an apple in a few steps. What about moving RIGHT? Let's see. If the player chooses RIGHT now, head moves to (1,5). Then, possible directions next could be DOWN (since RIGHT direction can turn to DOWN). Let's check:\n\nEpoch 48: move RIGHT. New head (1,5), direction RIGHT. Body shifts: (2,4) → (1,4), (2,3) → (2,4), (3,4) → (2,3), (3,5) → (3,4), (4,4) → (3,5), (5,5) → (4,4), (5,2) → (5,5), (5,1) → (5,2), (6,2) → (5,1), (6,3) → (6,2), (6,4) → (6,3), (6,5) → (6,4). So new body positions:\n\nHead: (1,5)\n\nBody 1: (1,4)\n\nBody 2: (2,4)\n\nBody 3: (2,3)\n\nBody 4: (3,4)\n\nBody 5: (3,5)\n\nBody 6: (4,4)\n\nBody 7: (5,5)\n\nBody 8: (5,2)\n\nBody 9: (5,1)\n\nBody 10: (6,2)\n\nBody 11: (6,3)\n\nBody 12: (6,4)\n\nNow, in epoch 49, direction is RIGHT. Next possible directions: UP (wall), RIGHT (column 6 is '#', so (1,6) is wall → collision), or DOWN. So direction DOWN would be chosen. Moving DOWN from (1,5) to (2,5). (2,5) is ' ' (safe). Epoch 50: head (2,5), direction DOWN.\n\nThen, in epoch 50, direction DOWN again. Moving to (3,5), which is a body segment (current body 5 is at (3,5)) → collision. So that's bad. So moving RIGHT could lead to a collision in the next steps.\n\nAlternatively, after moving RIGHT to (1,5), direction could be LEFT (but current direction is RIGHT, so reversing is LEFT → not allowed). So can't choose LEFT. So the only safe direction after moving RIGHT is DOWN, but that leads to (3,5) which is body.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems better. Another thing to consider: the snake's current body positions. Are there any other possible collisions if moving LEFT? The new head (1,3) is not on any body segments, so that's safe.\n\nTherefore, the best direction to choose is LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    H #\n#   SS #\n# A SS #\n#    SA#\n#SS  S #\n# SSSSA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (1,4), and the current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP would collide with the top wall (row 0), which is invalid. \n\n### Analysis of LEFT and RIGHT directions:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (1,3), which is empty (no walls or body segments). This direction avoids immediate collision. From (1,3), the snake can later move LEFT again to (1,2) and then DOWN to (2,2), (3,2), where an apple ('A') is located. This path allows the snake to reach an apple safely in subsequent moves.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (1,5), which is also empty. However, continuing RIGHT would hit the wall (column 6). Moving DOWN from (1,5) leads to (2,5), but further DOWN to (3,5) collides with the snake's body (row 3, column 5 is 'S'). This path risks collision with the body.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT avoids immediate danger and provides a viable path to an apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#   HS #\n#   SS #\n# A SS #\n#    SA#\n# S  S #\n# SSSSA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 49. The snake can't reverse direction, so from LEFT, it can't go RIGHT. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. But we need to check which of these directions will avoid collision with walls or the snake's own body, and ideally eat an apple.\n\nFirst, let's map the positions. Let's index the rows from top to bottom as 0 to 7 (since it's 8x8, 0-7 inclusive). Columns from left to right 0 to 7.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #   HS # → positions 1,2,3,4,5. So column 3 is 'H' (head), column 4 is 'S' (body). So head at (1,3).\nRow 2: #   SS # → columns 3 and 4 are 'S's. So (2,3), (2,4) are body.\nRow 3: # A SS # → column 2 is 'A', columns 3 and 4 are 'S's. (3,2) is apple, (3,3), (3,4) body.\nRow 4: #    SA# → column 4 is 'S', column 5 is 'A'. (4,4) body, (4,5) apple.\nRow 5: # S  S # → column 1 is 'S', column 4 is 'S'. (5,1), (5,4) body.\nRow 6: # SSSSA# → columns 1-4 are 'S's, column 5 is 'A'. (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) body; (6,5) apple.\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left, so the head (1,3) would move to (1,2) next if direction remains LEFT. Let's check if that's safe.\n\nCheck possible directions:\n\n1. LEFT (current direction, allowed since not reversing). New head position: (1,3) → left (column 3-1=2) → (1,2). What's in (1,2)? The current row 1 is \"#   HS #\", which is positions 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: '#'. So (1,2) is ' ' (empty). So moving left to (1,2) is safe. But is there an apple there? No, (1,2) is empty.\n\n2. UP: Can the snake turn up? Since current direction is LEFT, turning up is allowed (not reversing). The new head position would be (1-1,3) = (0,3). But row 0 is all walls (since row 0 is ########). So (0,3) is a wall. Moving up would cause collision with the wall. So UP is invalid.\n\n3. DOWN: Turning down from LEFT is allowed. New head position is (1+1,3) = (2,3). What's (2,3)? Row 2 is \"#   SS #\", which is (2,3) is 'S' (body). So the head would collide with the body. So DOWN is invalid.\n\n4. RIGHT: Reversing direction from LEFT, which is not allowed. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo the only possible direction is LEFT. Let's confirm the movement:\n\nCurrent head is at (1,3). Moving left to (1,2). The new head position is (1,2). The body segments will follow. Since the snake's length is the number of 'S' and 'H' (H is 1, S count as body). Let's count the current snake length.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: H (1), S (1) → 2\nRow 2: S (2), S (3) → 2 more → total 4\nRow 3: S (4), S (5) → 2 more → total 6\nRow 4: S (6) → 1 more → total 7\nRow 5: S (7), S (8) → 2 more → total 9\nRow 6: S (9), S (10), S (11), S (12) → 4 more → total 13. So H is 1, S is 12 → total length 13.\n\nWhen moving, the snake's body follows. So when moving left, the head moves to (1,2), and each body part moves to the position of the previous part. The tail (the last S) would move forward, but since there's no apple eaten, the tail is removed (since length remains same). Wait, no. The snake's length increases only when it eats an apple. Otherwise, when moving, the head moves, and the tail is removed (so the length stays the same). So in this case, since moving to (1,2) which is empty, the snake's body shifts: the new head is (1,2), then the old head (1,3) becomes S, then (1,4) S moves to (2,3), (2,3) S moves to (2,4), etc., and the tail (the last S in row 6, which is (6,4)) would be removed, replaced by a space. But that's perhaps more detail than needed. The key is whether the new head position is safe.\n\nSo the only safe direction is LEFT. Because UP hits a wall, DOWN hits the body, RIGHT is reverse. So the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#   HS #\n#   SS #\n# A SS #\n#    SA#\n# S  S #\n# SSSSA#\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the current game board, snake's position, and movement constraints:\n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Head (H)** is at (row 1, column 3) (0-indexed).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT (snake is moving left).\n- **Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot turn LEFT → RIGHT). Collisions with walls (`#`) or its own body (`S`) end the game.\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT** (current direction, allowed):  \n   The head would move to (row 1, column 2). Checking this position:  \n   Row 1 is `#   HS #`, so (row 1, column 2) is empty (` `). No collision with walls or body. Safe.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   The head would move to (row 0, column 3). Row 0 is all walls (`########`). Collision with wall. Unsafe.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   The head would move to (row 2, column 3). Row 2 is `#   SS #`, so (row 2, column 3) is `S` (snake's body). Collision with self. Unsafe.\n\n4. **RIGHT** (reverse of LEFT):  \n   Reversing direction is not allowed. Invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only safe direction is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #  HSS # (positions 2: H, 3: S, 4: S)\nRow 2: #   SS # (positions 3: S, 4: S)\nRow 3: # A SS # (position 2: A, 3: S, 4: S)\nRow 4: #    SA# (position 4: S, 5: A)\nRow 5: #    S # (position 4: S)\nRow 6: # SSSSA# (positions 1: S, 2: S, 3: S, 4: S, 5: A)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo the snake's head is at (row 1, column 2) since H is there. The current direction is LEFT, which means the snake is moving towards the left (decreasing column index). Let's confirm the snake's body positions to check for possible collisions.\n\nThe head (H) is at (1,2). Then the body (S) is in the next positions in the direction of movement. Since the current direction is LEFT, the body should be behind the head. Let's track the snake's body segments:\n\nFrom row 1, column 2 (H), moving LEFT (so previous position would be to the right). The next S is at (1,3), then (1,4). Then row 2, columns 3 and 4: (2,3), (2,4). Row 3, columns 3 and 4: (3,3), (3,4). Row 4, column 4: (4,4). Row 5, column 4: (5,4). Row 6, columns 1-4: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). So the snake's body is a continuous line from H (1,2) moving right (since direction is LEFT, the body is behind). Let's list all the body positions (excluding H):\n\n(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). Wait, maybe I need to reconstruct the snake's path properly. Because the snake moves one square at a time, each body part follows the previous. So the head moves, then each body part takes the position of the previous one. So the body segments are in the order of the snake's movement history.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to check the positions of S and H. Let's list all positions with H or S:\n\nRow 1: (1,2) H, (1,3) S, (1,4) S\nRow 2: (2,3) S, (2,4) S\nRow 3: (3,3) S, (3,4) S\nRow 4: (4,4) S, (4,5) A (so (4,4) is S)\nRow 5: (5,4) S\nRow 6: (6,1) S, (6,2) S, (6,3) S, (6,4) S, (6,5) A\n\nSo the snake's head is at (1,2). The next segments (body) are (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1). Wait, maybe that's the path. Let's think: when the snake moves LEFT, the head moves to (1,1) next. But we need to check possible directions. The current direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction, so it can't go RIGHT (since LEFT's opposite is RIGHT). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.\n\nWait, the rules say: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So current direction is LEFT, so the next direction can't be RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (same direction).\n\nNow, the snake's head is at (1,2). Let's find the next positions for each possible direction:\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So if the snake continues moving LEFT, the head will move to (1,1). Let's check if that's a wall or body. The top row (row 0) is all walls, row 1's first column (column 0) is '#', column 1 is part of row 1: row 1 is \"#  HSS #\", so columns 0 is '#', column 1 is ' ', column 2 is 'H', etc. So (1,1) is a space (empty). Is there a body part there? Let's check all S positions: none are at (1,1). So moving LEFT to (1,1) is safe.\n\nIf the snake turns UP, direction becomes UP. The head would move to (0,2). But row 0 is a wall (all '#'), so (0,2) is a wall. That's a collision. So UP is invalid.\n\nIf the snake turns DOWN, direction becomes DOWN. The head moves to (2,2). Let's check (2,2): row 2 is \"#   SS #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: '#'. So (2,2) is a space. Are there any S there? The S in row 2 are at (2,3) and (2,4). So (2,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT and DOWN. Now, check if any of these directions lead to apples.\n\nCurrent apples are positions where 'A' is present. Let's list the A positions:\n\nRow 3, column 2: (3,2) A (row 3 is \"# A SS #\", so column 2 is 'A').\n\nRow 4, column 5: (4,5) A (row 4: \"#    SA#\", column 5 is 'A').\n\nRow 6, column 5: (6,5) A (row 6: \"# SSSSA#\", column 5 is 'A').\n\nSo apples at (3,2), (4,5), (6,5).\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT to (1,1): that square is empty (no apple), so no growth. The next head position is (1,1), and the body follows. The tail (last S) would move forward. The snake's length is the number of H and S: let's count. H is 1, S count: row 1 has 2, row 2 has 2, row 3 has 2, row 4 has 1, row 5 has 1, row 6 has 4. Total S: 2+2+2+1+1+4=12. So total length is 13. So when moving, the tail (last S) would be removed unless an apple is eaten. So moving to (1,1) (no apple) would mean the tail (probably (6,1)) is removed, and the new head is (1,1).\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (2,2). Let's check (2,2) for apple: no, it's empty. So no apple eaten. The head moves to (2,2), which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better direction. Let's think about the current direction. The snake is moving LEFT. Let's see the next positions if it continues LEFT. The head is at (1,2). Next LEFT would be (1,1). Then, after that, next LEFT would be (1,0), which is a wall (column 0 is '#'), so that's a problem. So moving LEFT once is safe, but moving again would hit the wall. So perhaps we need to avoid that.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN? Let's see where (2,2) is. From there, possible next directions. If direction is DOWN, next move would be (3,2). Oh! (3,2) is an apple (A). So if the snake moves DOWN now (direction becomes DOWN), then in the next step (epoch 51), the head would be at (2,2). Then, if in epoch 51, the direction remains DOWN (since current direction would be DOWN), the next move (epoch 52) would be to (3,2), which has an apple. So that's a good path.\n\nWait, but the current epoch is 50, and the player is to choose the direction for the next move (epoch 50's move). Let's clarify: each epoch is a move. So in epoch 50, the player chooses a direction (must not be reverse of current direction, which is LEFT, so can't be RIGHT). The snake moves in that direction, and the game state updates.\n\nSo in the current state (epoch 50), the head is at (1,2), direction is LEFT. The player chooses direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Let's check each possible direction's outcome:\n\n1. Direction LEFT:\n   - New head position: (1,2) moving LEFT (column decreases by 1) → (1,1).\n   - Check if (1,1) is wall: row 1, column 1 is ' ' (from the board \"#  HSS #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'H', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: '#'). So (1,1) is safe (no wall, no body).\n   - Check if (1,1) has an apple: no. So the snake moves, the tail (last S) is removed. The new body positions would be H at (1,1), followed by the previous H (1,2) becoming S, then (1,3), (1,4), etc., with the last S (probably (6,1)) being removed. So the snake remains the same length (since no apple eaten).\n   - Next direction is LEFT (since the direction chosen is LEFT, so the next current direction is LEFT).\n\n2. Direction UP:\n   - New head position: (1,2) moving UP (row decreases by 1) → (0,2).\n   - (0,2) is part of the top wall (row 0 is all '#'), so collision. Game ends. So UP is invalid.\n\n3. Direction DOWN:\n   - New head position: (1,2) moving DOWN (row increases by 1) → (2,2).\n   - Check (2,2): row 2 is \"#   SS #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: '#'. So (2,2) is ' ', safe (no wall, no body).\n   - No apple here, so snake moves, tail is removed. The new direction is DOWN.\n   - Then, in the next epoch (epoch 51), the snake is moving DOWN. The head would be at (2,2), next move DOWN to (3,2). Let's check (3,2): row 3 is \"# A SS #\", so column 2 is 'A' (apple). So in epoch 51, if the direction is DOWN, the snake would move to (3,2) and eat the apple, increasing the score and growing.\n\nSo moving DOWN now (epoch 50) allows the snake to position itself to eat the apple at (3,2) in the next move. That's a good strategy.\n\nIf we choose LEFT now, the next position is (1,1). Then, in epoch 51, the direction would be LEFT (since we continued LEFT), so the head would move to (1,0), which is a wall (column 0 is '#'), causing collision. So that's bad.\n\nSo the best direction is DOWN. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent head at (1,2). Direction DOWN → new head (2,2). Safe. Next move (epoch 51) direction is DOWN, head moves to (3,2), which is an apple. That's a valid path. So choosing DOWN now is better.\n\n\n########\n#  HSS #\n#   SS #\n# A SS #\n#    SA#\n#    S #\n# SSSSA#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: (Row 1, Column 2) (marked as 'H').\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so RIGHT is invalid.\n- **Apples**: Located at (Row 3, Column 2), (Row 4, Column 5), and (Row 6, Column 5).\n- **Walls**: Surround the board (edges marked with '#').\n- **Body Segments**: S positions are spread across rows 1-6 (no immediate collision risk except walls).\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (Row 0, Column 2), which is a wall (game ends). Invalid.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (Row 1, Column 1). While safe initially, the next move (LEFT again) would hit the wall at (Row 1, Column 0). Risky long-term.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (Row 2, Column 2). This position is safe (no wall\/body collision). From here, the next move (DOWN again) would reach (Row 3, Column 2), which contains an apple. This allows the snake to eat the apple and grow in the next epoch.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the safest and most strategic choice, as it avoids immediate walls\/body collisions and positions the snake to eat an apple in the next move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#  SSS #\n#  HSS #\n# A SS #\n#    SA#\n#    S #\n#  SSSA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, and the current epoch is 51. The snake can't reverse direction, so since it's moving DOWN, the next direction can't be UP. The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n\nFirst, let's locate the snake's head. The head is 'H' in the board. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: ######## (index 0 maybe)\nRow 2: #  SSS # (index 1)\nRow 3: #  HSS # (index 2) → Here, the H is at position (2, 3) assuming rows are 0-based. Let's check each row's characters. Let's index rows from top to bottom as 0 to 7 (since it's 8x8). Let's list each row with indices:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  SSS # → positions 1-6: '  SSS ' (so positions 2,3,4 are 'S', S, S)\nRow 2: #  HSS # → positions 1-6: '  HSS ' → position 3 is 'H', 4 and 5 are 'S'\nRow 3: # A SS # → positions 1-6: ' A SS ' → position 2 is 'A', 4 and 5 are 'S'\nRow 4: #    SA# → positions 1-6: '    SA' → position 5 is 'S', 6 is 'A' (since row 4 is \"#    SA#\", so columns 1-6: 1 is ' ', 2 ' ', 3 ' ', 4 ' ', 5 'S', 6 'A'? Wait, 8 characters per row. Let's index columns 0 to 7 (since 8 columns). So for row 2 (index 2), which is \"#  HSS #\", the columns are:\n\nColumn 0: '#'\nColumn 1: ' '\nColumn 2: ' '\nColumn 3: 'H'\nColumn 4: 'S'\nColumn 5: 'S'\nColumn 6: ' '\nColumn 7: '#'\n\nSo the head (H) is at (row=2, column=3). Because rows are 0-based from top. So row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So when moving, the next position of the head would be (row+1, column). Since current direction is DOWN, moving down would take the head from (2,3) to (3,3). Let's check that position.\n\nRow 3 (index 3) is \"# A SS #\". Columns 0-7: 0='#', 1=' ', 2='A', 3=' ', 4='S', 5='S', 6=' ', 7='#'. So (3,3) is ' ' (empty). So if we move DOWN, the head goes to (3,3). Now, what's the next cell? Let's see if that's safe.\n\nBut wait, we need to check for collisions. The snake's body is all the 'S's. Let's list all the S positions. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1 (index 1): \"#  SSS #\" → columns 3,4,5 are 'S' (columns 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S')? Wait, row 1: \"#  SSS #\". Let's split into characters:\n\nRow 1: [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] ' ', [3] 'S', [4] 'S', [5] 'S', [6] ' ', [7] '#'\n\nRow 2 (index 2): \"#  HSS #\" → [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] ' ', [3] 'H', [4] 'S', [5] 'S', [6] ' ', [7] '#'\n\nRow 3 (index 3): \"# A SS #\" → [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] 'A', [3] ' ', [4] 'S', [5] 'S', [6] ' ', [7] '#'\n\nRow 4 (index 4): \"#    SA#\" → [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] ' ', [3] ' ', [4] ' ', [5] 'S', [6] 'A', [7] '#'\n\nRow 5 (index 5): \"#    S #\" → [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] ' ', [3] ' ', [4] ' ', [5] 'S', [6] ' ', [7] '#'\n\nRow 6 (index 6): \"#  SSSA#\" → [0] '#', [1] ' ', [2] ' ', [3] 'S', [4] 'S', [5] 'S', [6] 'A', [7] '#'\n\nSo S positions (excluding H):\n\nRow 1, columns 3,4,5 → (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nRow 2, columns 4,5 → (2,4), (2,5)\n\nRow 3, columns 4,5 → (3,4), (3,5)\n\nRow 4, column 5 → (4,5)\n\nRow 5, column 5 → (5,5)\n\nRow 6, columns 3,4,5 → (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo the current head is at (2,3). The current direction is DOWN. So next head position if moving DOWN is (3,3). Let's check (3,3). The cell there is ' ' (empty). So no collision with body. Also, (3,3) is within the board (rows 0-7, columns 0-7; row 3 is between 0 and 7, column 3 is between 0 and 7, not a wall). So moving DOWN is possible.\n\nNow, what if we turn LEFT? The current direction is DOWN. Turning LEFT would mean the new direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction (so can't go UP from DOWN). LEFT is allowed. So the new direction is LEFT. The head's next position would be (2, 3-1) = (2,2). Let's check (2,2). The cell at row 2, column 2 is ' ' (from row 2: \"#  HSS #\", columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', etc. So (2,2) is ' '). So moving LEFT would take head to (2,2). Is that cell a wall? No. Is it part of the body? Let's check S positions. (2,2) is not in any of the S positions listed. So safe.\n\nIf we turn RIGHT, direction becomes RIGHT. Next head position is (2, 3+1) = (2,4). (2,4) is 'S' (from row 2: \"#  HSS #\", column 4 is 'S'). Oh, that's part of the snake's body. So moving RIGHT would cause a collision with the body. That's bad, game over. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, or UP (but UP is reverse of current direction DOWN, which is not allowed). So UP is invalid. So options are DOWN and LEFT.\n\nNow, check if moving DOWN leads to any apple. The next head position (3,3) is ' ' (no apple). What about moving LEFT to (2,2). Let's check if (2,2) has an apple. The cell (2,2) is ' ' (from row 2: \"#  HSS #\"). So no apple there.\n\nWhat's the position of apples? Let's check the board for 'A's.\n\nRow 3 (index 3): \"# A SS #\" → column 2 is 'A' → (3,2)\n\nRow 4 (index 4): \"#    SA#\" → column 6 is 'A' → (4,6)\n\nRow 6 (index 6): \"#  SSSA#\" → column 6 is 'A' → (6,6)\n\nSo apples are at (3,2), (4,6), (6,6).\n\nSo moving DOWN to (3,3). Then, next possible moves. Let's think about the path to apples. The closest apple is (3,2) which is to the left of (3,3). So if after moving DOWN, the direction could be LEFT next time. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, if we move LEFT now (direction LEFT), the head is at (2,2). Then, next direction can't be RIGHT (reverse). Possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Current direction would be LEFT. Then next move would be (2,1). Let's check (2,1): ' ' (from row 2, column 1 is ' '). That's safe. But where's the apple (3,2) in row 3, column 2. So (3,2) is below (2,2). So if the head is at (2,2), moving DOWN next would reach (3,2), which is an apple. That would be good. Let's see.\n\nCurrent head at (2,3). If we move LEFT to (2,2) (direction LEFT). Then, next possible direction could be DOWN (since current direction is LEFT, next direction can't be RIGHT). So moving DOWN from (2,2) would take head to (3,2), which is the apple. Then, the snake would eat the apple, grow, and score increases. That's a good path.\n\nIf we move DOWN now (current direction DOWN) to (3,3), then next direction options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (can't go UP). Let's see (3,3) is ' ', and (3,2) is the apple. So from (3,3), moving LEFT would take head to (3,2) (apple). That's also possible. So if we go DOWN first, then LEFT, we can get the apple.\n\nSo which path is better? Let's check if there's any danger in either path.\n\nFirst, moving DOWN to (3,3). The next move could be LEFT to (3,2) (apple). Let's check (3,2) is 'A'. So that's safe. The cell (3,2) is not part of the body. The S positions are (3,4), (3,5). So (3,2) is safe. So moving DOWN then LEFT would get the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (2,2), then DOWN to (3,2) (apple). That's also safe. Both paths can reach the apple.\n\nBut let's check the snake's body positions to see if there's any potential collision in the next steps. Let's think about the body movement. When the snake moves, the body follows. Since the snake's length is more than 1, each move, the tail may or may not move (depending on whether it ate an apple). Since the snake hasn't eaten an apple in the current move, the tail would move (since the length remains the same). But in this case, the current move (the one we're deciding) hasn't eaten an apple yet, so after moving, if no apple is eaten, the tail will move. But perhaps that's more complex. Let's focus on the immediate next move.\n\nThe question is to choose the direction that allows the snake to eat an apple as soon as possible and avoid collision.\n\nIf we choose DOWN now, next head position (3,3). Then next move LEFT to (3,2) (apple). That's two steps. If we choose LEFT now, next head (2,2). Then next move DOWN to (3,2) (apple). Also two steps. So same number of steps.\n\nBut are there any other factors? Let's check if moving LEFT now could lead to a wall collision. The head is at (2,2). If we move LEFT again (direction LEFT), next position (2,1), which is ' ' (safe). Then (2,0) is a wall (column 0 is '#'), so can't go further left. So no problem.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (3,3), then LEFT to (3,2) (apple). That's safe.\n\nAnother thing to check: Are there any other apples that are more accessible? The other apples are at (4,6) and (6,6). Let's see the distance. The head is at (2,3). (4,6) is (row 4, column 6). The distance is (4-2) = 2 rows down, (6-3)=3 columns right. So 5 steps. (6,6) is (6-2)=4 rows down, (6-3)=3 columns right → 7 steps. So the closest is (3,2), which is 1 row down and 1 column left from current head (if moving DOWN then LEFT) or 1 column left and 1 row down (if moving LEFT then DOWN).\n\nSo either direction (DOWN or LEFT) can reach the apple in two steps. But which direction is possible?\n\nWait, the current direction is DOWN. If we choose to move LEFT (direction LEFT), that's allowed (since it's not the reverse). So both directions (DOWN and LEFT) are possible, but moving RIGHT is invalid (as (2,4) is 'S').\n\nSo which one to choose? Let's check if moving DOWN now would lead to any immediate problem. The next position (3,3) is safe, no collision. Moving LEFT to (2,2) is also safe.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better option. Let's see if there's any other possible collision in the next steps. For example, after moving DOWN, the snake's body will shift. Let's think about the snake's body structure. The snake's body is a chain. The head is at (2,3). The body segments are probably in the order of movement. Since the current direction is DOWN, the previous direction might have been DOWN as well, so the body is following. Let's assume the snake's body is arranged such that the next segment after the head is (2,4), then (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), etc. But perhaps that's more detailed than needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best choice is to move towards the nearest apple. The nearest apple is (3,2). To reach (3,2) from (2,3), the head can move DOWN to (3,3) then LEFT to (3,2), or move LEFT to (2,2) then DOWN to (3,2). Both paths are valid.\n\nBut let's check the current direction. The snake is moving DOWN. If we continue moving DOWN, the next position is (3,3), which is safe. Then, changing direction to LEFT (allowed, since current direction would be DOWN, next direction LEFT is allowed). That's possible.\n\nAlternatively, changing direction to LEFT now (from DOWN) is allowed. So both options are possible.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT now is better because (3,2) is in row 3, column 2, which is directly below (2,2) (if we move LEFT to (2,2), then down to (3,2)). That's a straight path. Let's confirm.\n\nCurrent head (2,3). Move LEFT → (2,2). Then, direction can be DOWN (since current direction is LEFT, next direction can't be RIGHT). So moving DOWN from (2,2) → (3,2), which is the apple. That's correct. So that's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN → (3,3). Then, direction LEFT → (3,2) (apple). Also valid.\n\nSo which direction should we choose? Since both are possible, but perhaps the problem expects us to choose the direction that leads to the apple in the next step. Wait, but in the current move, neither direction leads to an apple. The apple is at (3,2). So the current move's target cell (whether (3,3) or (2,2)) doesn't have an apple. So the next move after that would get the apple.\n\nBut maybe there's another apple we're missing. Let's check again the board for 'A's.\n\nRow 3: \"# A SS #\" → (3,2) is 'A'\n\nRow 4: \"#    SA#\" → (4,6) is 'A'\n\nRow 6: \"#  SSSA#\" → (6,6) is 'A'\n\nYes, three apples. So (3,2) is the closest.\n\nAnother thing to check: Are there any body segments in the path. For example, moving LEFT to (2,2): is there any S in (2,2)? No. (2,2) is ' '.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3,3): (3,3) is ' '.\n\nSo both directions are safe.\n\nBut perhaps the problem requires choosing a direction that avoids future collisions. Let's think about the snake's body positions. Let's list all S positions again:\n\n(1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\n(2,4), (2,5)\n\n(3,4), (3,5)\n\n(4,5)\n\n(5,5)\n\n(6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo the body is mostly along column 5 (rows 1-5), and column 3 (rows 1,6), and column 4 (rows 1-3,6). So the right side (columns 3-5) has a lot of body. The left side (columns 1-2) is mostly empty.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT, it's moving into the left side, which is more open. That might be better for avoiding future collisions. Whereas moving DOWN keeps it in the same area where the body is. So perhaps moving LEFT is better to explore more space.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake can move LEFT now, then DOWN to get the apple, and then have more space to move. So I think moving LEFT is a good choice here.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  SSS #\n#  HSS #\n# A SS #\n#    SA#\n#    S #\n#  SSSA#\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN and cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **RIGHT**: The head (at row 2, column 3) would move to (2, 4), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a collision, so RIGHT is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (3, 3), which is empty (' '). No collision occurs, but there is no apple here.  \n- **LEFT**: The head would move to (2, 2), which is empty (' '). No collision occurs, and this direction leads the snake toward the nearest apple at (3, 2) (down from (2, 2) in the next move).  \n\nMoving LEFT avoids immediate collision, positions the snake closer to the nearest apple, and keeps it in a less crowded area of the board (left side has more empty space compared to the right side, which is filled with the snake's body). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board. The board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' as walls. \n\nLet me parse the board row by row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #  SSS # (columns 2,3,4 are S)\nRow 2: # HSSS # (columns 1 is H, 2,3,4 are S)\nRow 3: # A SS # (column 2 is A, 3,4 are S)\nRow 4: #    SA# (column 4 is S, 5 is A)\nRow 5: #    S # (column 4 is S)\nRow 6: #   SSA# (columns 3,4 are S, 5 is A)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake's head is at row 2, column 1 (since H is there). The snake's body is made of S's. Let's track the snake's body to see its length and positions. \n\nFrom row 2 (H at (2,1)), the S's in row 2 are at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Then row 1 has S's at (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). Row 3 has S's at (3,3), (3,4). Row 4 has S at (4,4). Row 5 has S at (5,4). Row 6 has S's at (6,3), (6,4). So the snake's body is a continuous path. Let's list the positions in order (since the head is H, followed by body S's in the direction of movement). Since the current direction is LEFT, the head was moving left. So the previous positions would be: when moving left, the head moves from (2,2) to (2,1) (since current H is at (2,1)), so the body would follow. The body S's are in the path the head has taken. \n\nThe snake's head is at (2,1). The current direction is LEFT. The possible directions the player can choose are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, but cannot reverse direction. Since current direction is LEFT, reversing would be RIGHT. So the player can't choose RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, we need to check where each direction would move the head next. Let's compute the next head position for each possible direction.\n\nCurrent head position: (row, column) = (2,1) (since row 2, column 1). Let's index rows from 0 to 7, columns 0 to 7 (since 8x8, each row is 8 characters).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So the snake's movement direction is LEFT (so moving towards column 0). Let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. LEFT: next head position would be (2, 0). But column 0 is a wall (since row 2 starts with '#', which is column 0). So moving LEFT would hit the wall. That's a collision, game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n2. UP: moving UP would change the direction to UP. The next head position is (2-1, 1) = (1,1). Let's check what's at (1,1). The row 1 is \"#  SSS #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: '#'. So (1,1) is a space (empty). So that's a valid position. No collision with body or wall.\n\n3. DOWN: moving DOWN would change direction to DOWN. Next head position is (2+1, 1) = (3,1). Let's check row 3: \"# A SS #\". Columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: '#'. So (3,1) is a space (empty). Valid position.\n\n4. RIGHT: Can't choose RIGHT because current direction is LEFT, reversing is not allowed. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP or DOWN. Now, we need to check if moving in these directions would hit any apples or body.\n\nLet's check UP first:\n\nUP direction: next head at (1,1). What's there? From row 1, column 1 is ' ' (empty). So no apple. The snake would move here. The body would follow. The snake's length would remain the same (since no apple eaten). The new head is (1,1), and the body segments shift. The previous head (2,1) becomes S, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nNow check DOWN direction: next head at (3,1). Row 3, column 1 is ' ' (empty). So no apple here either. Wait, row 3 is \"# A SS #\". Column 2 is 'A' (apple at (3,2)). So (3,1) is empty. So moving DOWN would take the head to (3,1), which is safe.\n\nBut wait, are there any apples in the path that the snake can reach next? Let's check the positions of apples. Let's list all 'A's on the board:\n\nRow 3, column 2: (3,2) is 'A'.\nRow 4, column 5: (4,5) is 'A'.\nRow 6, column 5: (6,5) is 'A'.\n\nSo apples at (3,2), (4,5), (6,5).\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (1,1), then the next possible moves would depend on where the apples are. If moving DOWN to (3,1), then the next position could be towards (3,2) (the apple there). Let's see:\n\nIf current direction is changed to DOWN (from LEFT), then the next move (epoch 53) would be in the DOWN direction. So if the player chooses DOWN now, the next direction is DOWN, and the next head position would be (3,1). Then, in the next step (epoch 54), the snake would move down again to (4,1). Let's check (4,1): row 4 is \"#    SA#\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'A', 6: '#'. So (4,1) is ' ', safe. Then (5,1) in row 5: \"#    S #\", (5,1) is ' ', safe. Then (6,1) in row 6: \"#   SSA#\", (6,1) is ' ', safe. So moving down might allow the snake to reach (3,2) (the apple at (3,2)) in the next move if it turns right. Because after moving down to (3,1), the direction is DOWN, so next move could be to (4,1), but if the player then turns right (since direction was DOWN, can't reverse to UP, but can turn left or right). Wait, no. The direction can be changed each step, as long as it's not reversing. For example, if current direction is DOWN, next direction can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (can't be UP). So from (3,1), if direction is RIGHT, then the next head position would be (3,2), which is the apple. That would be good. So moving DOWN now might set up the snake to reach that apple next.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves UP to (1,1), direction becomes UP. Next move would be (0,1), but row 0 is a wall (all '#'), so (0,1) is a wall. So moving UP again would hit the wall. So from (1,1), if direction is UP, next step is (0,1) which is wall. So that's bad. So after moving UP to (1,1), the player would have to change direction to avoid the wall. The possible directions from UP would be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. But LEFT from (1,1) would be (1,0), which is a wall (row 1 starts with '#'). So LEFT is wall. So from (1,1), possible directions after moving UP would be RIGHT (since UP is current direction, can't reverse to DOWN). So direction RIGHT: next head (1,2). (1,2) is 'S' (from row 1: \"#  SSS #\", column 2 is S). So that's a collision with the body. Oh, that's bad. So moving UP to (1,1) would lead to possible collision in the next step.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\nCurrent head (2,1). If direction is UP, next head (1,1). Then, the next possible directions (since current direction is UP) can't be DOWN. So possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- UP: (0,1) is wall. Die.\n- LEFT: (1,0) is wall (row 1, column 0 is '#'). Die.\n- RIGHT: (1,2). What's in (1,2)? Row 1 is \"#  SSS #\", column 2 is 'S'. So that's the snake's body. So collision. Die.\n\nSo moving UP now would lead to a dead end in the next step. That's dangerous.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN? Let's see:\n\nCurrent head (2,1) → direction DOWN → next head (3,1). Then, the current direction is now DOWN, so next move can't be UP. Possible directions: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nAt (3,1), the snake's head is here. Let's check the body positions. The body of the snake is S's. The previous head was (2,1), which becomes S. The body segments would be (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4). So (3,1) is a new position, not part of the body. So moving to (3,1) is safe.\n\nNext, possible directions from (3,1) with current direction DOWN:\n\n- DOWN: next head (4,1). (4,1) is ' ' (row 4: \"#    SA#\"). Safe.\n- LEFT: next head (3,0) → wall. Die.\n- RIGHT: next head (3,2). (3,2) is 'A' (apple). That's good! Because moving RIGHT from (3,1) (current direction is DOWN, so changing direction to RIGHT is allowed (not reversing)). So (3,2) is an apple. So if the snake moves DOWN now (to (3,1)), then next step can turn RIGHT to (3,2) and eat the apple. That would increase the score and grow the snake.\n\nSo moving DOWN now allows the snake to reach an apple in the next step. That's a good move. \n\nSo the best direction here is DOWN. Because moving UP leads to a dead end, LEFT hits a wall, RIGHT is invalid (reverse). So the answer should be DOWN.\n\n\n########\n#  SSS #\n# HSSS #\n# A SS #\n#    SA#\n#    S #\n#   SSA#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 2, column 1).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT (snake is moving left).\n- **Collision Rules**: The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Collisions with walls ('#') or its own body ('S') end the game.\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (3,2), (4,5), and (6,5).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: Next head position would be (2,0), which is a wall ('#'). Collision → Game Over. Invalid.\n2. **RIGHT**: Reverses the current direction (LEFT → RIGHT is not allowed). Invalid.\n3. **UP**: Next head position is (1,1). This is empty, but subsequent moves are risky:\n   - From (1,1), possible directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) all lead to collisions (wall or body). Dead end.\n4. **DOWN**: Next head position is (3,1). This is empty, and subsequent moves can target the apple at (3,2):\n   - From (3,1), changing direction to RIGHT (allowed, as current direction would be DOWN) moves the head to (3,2), which contains an apple. This would safely eat the apple and grow the snake.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN avoids immediate collision and sets up a safe path to an apple in the next step.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided. \n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S', apples are 'A'. The current direction is DOWN, and we're at epoch 53 (so 47 epochs left before the game ends). The snake can't reverse direction, so from DOWN, the possible directions are UP (but that's reversing, so not allowed), LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (same direction). Wait, the problem says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is DOWN, reversing would be UP. So the allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n\nFirst, let's map out the current positions. Let's index the rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7), and columns 0 (left) to 7 (right).\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  SSS # → columns 2,3,4 are S (since positions 1 and 7 are walls)\nRow 2: # SSSS # → columns 1,2,3,4 are S\nRow 3: # H SS # → columns 1 is H, 2,3 are S (since row 3: index 1 is H, then 2 and 3 are S)\nRow 4: #    SA# → columns 4 is S, 5 is A (row 4: columns 4 and 5)\nRow 5: # A  S # → columns 1 is A, 4 is S\nRow 6: #   SSA# → columns 3,4 are S, 5 is A (row 6: columns 3,4,5)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the head (H) is at row 3, column 1 (since row 3 is \"# H SS #\", so positions 0 is #, 1 is H, 2 is S, 3 is S, 4 is space, 5 is space, 6 is #, 7 is #).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So if the snake moves DOWN, the next head position would be row 4, column 1. Let's check what's there. Row 4 is \"#    SA#\", which is columns 0: #, 1: space (since positions 1-3 are spaces), 2: space, 3: space, 4: S, 5: A, 6: #, 7: #. So row 4, column 1 is a space. So moving DOWN would take the head to (4,1). Is that a collision? The current body parts are S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: columns 2,3,4 (S)\nRow 2: columns 1,2,3,4 (S)\nRow 3: columns 2,3 (S)\nRow 4: column 4 (S)\nRow 5: column 4 (S)\nRow 6: columns 3,4 (S)\n\nSo (4,1) is a space, not a wall or body. So moving DOWN is safe here.\n\nWhat about moving LEFT? Current direction is DOWN. LEFT is a possible direction (not reversing). The head is at (3,1). Moving LEFT would take it to (3,0). But (3,0) is a wall (since row 3 starts with #). So moving LEFT would hit a wall, game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nMoving RIGHT: Current head is (3,1). Moving RIGHT would take it to (3,2). But (3,2) is S (since row 3 has \"# H SS #\", so column 2 is S). So that's a self-collision. So moving RIGHT would hit the body, game over.\n\nSo possible directions are DOWN (safe) or maybe other options. Let's confirm:\n\nPossible directions are UP (reverse of DOWN, not allowed), LEFT (wall), RIGHT (body), or DOWN (safe). So the only valid direction is DOWN. Because any other direction would cause collision.\n\nWait, let's check again. The snake's movement: each move, the head moves in the new direction, and the body follows. But when moving, the body's positions shift. However, the problem states that the collision is checked when the head moves into a square. So the current body positions are all S's except the head. So if the new head position is on any S (body), it's a collision.\n\nSo for moving RIGHT: (3,1) → (3,2). (3,2) is S (from row 3: \"# H SS #\", which is columns 1: H, 2:S, 3:S). So yes, moving RIGHT into (3,2) would hit the body.\n\nMoving LEFT: (3,1) → (3,0) → which is a wall (row 3, column 0 is #), so collision.\n\nMoving UP: (3,1) → (2,1). Let's check (2,1). Row 2 is \"# SSSS #\", which is columns 1:S (since columns 1-4 are S). So (2,1) is S. So moving UP (reverse direction) is allowed? Wait, the problem says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is DOWN, the reverse is UP. So you can't turn UP. So even if moving UP was possible, you can't choose it. So the allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. But LEFT and RIGHT are invalid (collision), so only DOWN is possible.\n\nSo the answer must be DOWN.\n\n\n########\n#  SSS #\n# SSSS #\n# H SS #\n#    SA#\n# A  S #\n#   SSA#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Current Head Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at row 3, column 1.\n2. **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid).\n3. **Possible Directions**: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (3,1) would take the head to (3,0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a wall collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (3,1) would take the head to (3,2), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a self-collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (3,1) takes the head to (4,1). Checking row 4 (\"#    SA#\"), column 1 is empty (no wall or body). This is safe and valid.\n\nThe only valid direction that avoids collision is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board.\n\nThe board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' as walls. Let's list out each row to visualize the snake's position and the apples.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #  SSS # (positions 2-4 are S, others are space except walls)\nRow 2: # SSSS # (positions 1-4 are S)\nRow 3: # S SS # (positions 1 is S, 3-4 are S)\nRow 4: # H  SA# (positions 1 is H, 5 is S, 6 is A)\nRow 5: # A  S # (positions 2 is A, 5 is S)\nRow 6: #    SA# (positions 4 is S, 5 is A)\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. The snake's head is at row 4, column 1 (since H is in row 4, let's count columns from 0: row 4 is \"# H  SA#\", so positions 0 is #, 1 is H, 2 is space, 3 is space, 4 is S, 5 is A. Wait, let's correct that. Let's index each cell properly. Each row is 8 characters, with first and last being #. So for row 4: \"# H  SA#\" is positions 0: #, 1: H, 2:  , 3:  , 4: S, 5: A, 6: #? Wait, 8 characters. Let's count: 0-7. So row 4 is:\n\n0: #, 1: H, 2:  (space), 3:  (space), 4: S, 5: A, 6: #. Wait, 0-7: 0 is #, 1 is H, 2 is space, 3 is space, 4 is S, 5 is A, 6 is #? Wait, 8 characters: 0-7. So \"# H  SA#\" would be:\n\nIndices 0: #, 1: H, 2:  , 3:  , 4: S, 5: A, 6: #? No, 0-7, so 7th is #. Let me recheck. The row is \"# H  SA#\". Let's count each character:\n\nCharacters: [0]'#', [1]' ', [2]'H', [3]' ', [4]' ', [5]'S', [6]'A', [7]'#'? Wait, no, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's split each row into 8 characters. Let's take row 4 as \"# H  SA#\". Let's split it:\n\n- Character 0: '#'\n- Character 1: ' '\n- Character 2: 'H'\n- Character 3: ' '\n- Character 4: ' '\n- Character 5: 'S'\n- Character 6: 'A'\n- Character 7: '#'\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the row is 8 characters long. So the H (head) is at (row=4, column=2). Because rows are 0-7 (top to bottom), columns 0-7 (left to right).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, which means the snake is moving down. So the next position the head will move to is row 5, column 2. Let's check where that is.\n\nRow 5 is \"# A  S #\". Let's split that into 8 characters:\n\n0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\n\nSo row 5, column 2 is 'A' (an apple). So if the snake continues moving DOWN (current direction), the head moves to (5,2), which is an apple. Eating that apple would make the snake grow. The new head position is (5,2), and the body would follow. Also, since it's moving down, the direction is allowed (can't reverse, but current direction is down, so next direction can be up? No, wait, the rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is DOWN, the next direction can't be UP. But the player is choosing the direction input, but the snake's movement is in the direction it's facing. Wait, the problem says: \"The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So, for example, if current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. So, if current direction is DOWN, the next direction can't be UP. The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since DOWN is current direction, allowed).\n\nSo the current direction is DOWN, and the next move is in the direction the snake is facing. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs.\" So, each epoch, the player provides a direction input (which must not be a reversal of current direction), and the snake then moves in that new direction. So the direction input is the new direction, which must not reverse the current direction.\n\nWait, let's recheck the rules: \"The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So, the player's input direction must not be the reverse of the current direction. For example, if current direction is UP, the player can't input DOWN. If current direction is DOWN, player can't input UP. If current direction is LEFT, can't input RIGHT, and vice versa.\n\nSo, current direction is DOWN. So the player can input directions: DOWN (continue), LEFT, or RIGHT. Because UP is the reverse of DOWN, so it's invalid.\n\nSo the possible directions to choose from are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, the head is at (4,2) (row 4, column 2). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 4: \"# H  SA#\" → columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: H, 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: S, 6: A, 7: #. So (row, column) is (4,2).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, so the next position if moving DOWN would be (5,2). Let's check row 5, column 2. Row 5 is \"# A  S #\": columns 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: A, 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: S, 6: ' ', 7: #. So (5,2) is A. So if the snake moves DOWN (direction input DOWN), then the head moves to (5,2), which is an apple. Eating the apple would increase the score, and the snake grows. The new head is at (5,2), and the body parts follow. The previous head (4,2) becomes part of the body (S), and the rest of the body shifts.\n\nBut we need to check if moving in other directions (LEFT or RIGHT) would cause collision.\n\nLet's check direction LEFT. The current direction is DOWN, so LEFT is allowed (not reverse). If direction is LEFT, the head moves to (4,1). Let's check (4,1): row 4, column 1 is ' ' (since row 4's column 1 is ' '). Is that a valid position? The walls are the edges (row 0 and 7, column 0 and 7). So (4,1) is within the board (row 4 is between 0 and 7, column 1 is between 0 and 7). So no wall collision. Now, check if (4,1) is part of the snake's body. The body is represented by S. Let's look at the current board.\n\nLooking for S positions:\n\nRow 1: #  SSS # → columns 2,3,4 are S (since row 1 is [0]#, [1]' ', [2]S, [3]S, [4]S, [5]' ', [6]' ', [7]#) → (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) are S.\n\nRow 2: # SSSS # → columns 1,2,3,4 are S → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\n\nRow 3: # S SS # → columns 1,3,4 are S → (3,1), (3,3), (3,4).\n\nRow 4: # H  SA# → column 5 is S → (4,5).\n\nRow 5: # A  S # → column 5 is S → (5,5).\n\nRow 6: #    SA# → column 4 is S, column 5 is A? Let's split row 6: \"#    SA#\" → [0]#, [1]' ', [2]' ', [3]' ', [4]S, [5]A, [6]' ', [7]#? Or maybe [0]#, [1]' ', [2]' ', [3]' ', [4]S, [5]A, [6]' ', [7]#. So (6,4) is S.\n\nSo S positions are:\n\n(1,2), (1,3), (1,4),\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4),\n\n(3,1), (3,3), (3,4),\n\n(4,5),\n\n(5,5),\n\n(6,4).\n\nThe head is at (4,2). So (4,1) is (row 4, column 1). Is that S? Looking at row 4, column 1: it's ' ', so no. So moving LEFT to (4,1) is safe (no collision with body or wall). But there's no apple there, so the snake would just move, and the tail would move (since it's not eating an apple, the length remains the same; the tail would remove the last segment).\n\nNow, direction RIGHT. Current direction is DOWN, so RIGHT is allowed. The head would move to (4,3). Check (4,3): row 4, column 3. Row 4's columns are [0]#, [1]' ', [2]H, [3]' ', [4]' ', [5]S, [6]A, [7]#. So column 3 is ' ', which is empty. So (4,3) is safe (no collision with body or wall). No apple there either.\n\nSo the possible directions are DOWN (eat apple), LEFT (safe, no apple), RIGHT (safe, no apple).\n\nThe goal is to eat as many apples as possible. So moving DOWN would eat the apple at (5,2). That's beneficial. Let's confirm that (5,2) is indeed an apple. Row 5 is \"# A  S #\", which has 'A' at column 2. So yes. So moving DOWN (current direction) would result in eating the apple, increasing the score, and the snake grows.\n\nAre there any other apples on the board? Let's check.\n\nRow 4, column 6: A (from row 4: \"# H  SA#\" → column 6 is A? Let's check again. Row 4: \"# H  SA#\" → 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: H, 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: S, 6: A, 7: # → (4,6) is A.\n\nRow 5, column 2: A (as before).\n\nRow 6: \"#    SA#\" → 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: S, 5: A, 6: ' ', 7: # → (6,5) is A.\n\nSo there are three apples: (4,6), (5,2), (6,5).\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN, the next head position is (5,2), which is an apple. So that's good. Let's check if moving DOWN would cause any collision. The new head position (5,2) is not part of the current body. The current body parts are the S positions listed earlier, none of which are (5,2). So moving there is safe. The snake will eat the apple, grow, and the score increases.\n\nSo the best direction here is DOWN, as it allows eating an apple without collision.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SSS #\n# SSSS #\n# S SS #\n# H  SA#\n# A  S #\n#    SA#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at (row=4, column=2).\n- Current direction is DOWN, so the snake can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (cannot reverse to UP).\n- The next position if moving DOWN is (row=5, column=2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score and grow the snake.\n- Moving LEFT (to row=4, column=1) or RIGHT (to row=4, column=3) would not hit walls or the snake's body but would not eat an apple.\n\nSince moving DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple safely, this is the best choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #  SSS # (so positions 2,3,4 are S)\nRow 2: # SSSS # (positions 1,2,3,4 are S)\nRow 3: # S SS # (positions 1,3,4 are S)\nRow 4: # S  SA# (positions 1,5 are S; position 6 is A)\nRow 5: # H AS # (position 1 is H; positions 3 is A, 4 is S)\nRow 6: #    SA# (positions 4,5 are S; position 6 is A)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe snake's head is at row 5, column 1 (since H is there). The current direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. Let's check where the head will move next if we keep going DOWN. The next position would be row 6, column 1. Let's check that position.\n\nLooking at row 6: \"#    SA#\" which is columns 0: #, 1: (space), 2: (space), 3: (space), 4: S, 5: S, 6: A, 7: #. So row 6, column 1 is a space (empty). So moving DOWN would take the head to (6,1), which is safe. But wait, the snake's body is made of S's. Let's see if (6,1) is part of the body. The body S's are in various positions. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: (3,1), (3,3), (3,4)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,5)\nRow 5: (5,4)\nRow 6: (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo (6,1) is not an S, so moving DOWN here is safe. But maybe there's a better direction. Let's check the possible directions. The current direction is DOWN. The snake can't reverse direction, so it can't go UP (since current is DOWN, reversing would be UP). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n\nWait, the rules say: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, no. The example says that reversing is not allowed. So if current direction is DOWN, the opposite is UP. So the snake can't turn UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\nNow, let's check each possible direction:\n\n1. Continue DOWN: next position (6,1). What's there? It's a space. So the snake moves there. The tail (since length is such that when moving, the tail may or may not move. But since the snake's length is the number of S and H. Let's count the S's and H: H is 1, S's: let's count.\n\nRow 1: 3 S\nRow 2: 4 S\nRow 3: 3 S (positions 1,3,4)\nRow 4: 2 S (positions 1,5)\nRow 5: 1 S (position 4)\nRow 6: 2 S (positions 4,5)\nTotal S: 3+4+3+2+1+2=15. So total length is 15+1=16. So when moving, the snake's body will follow. The head moves to (6,1), and the last segment (the tail) will be removed if the snake didn't eat an apple. So the new head is (6,1). Now, check if that's a wall or body. (6,1) is within the board (rows 0-7, columns 0-7). Walls are on the edges (row 0,7 and column 0,7). So (6,1) is not a wall. And not part of the body, so safe.\n\n2. Turn LEFT: current direction is DOWN. Turning LEFT would mean the new direction is LEFT. The head is at (5,1). Moving LEFT would take it to (5,0). Column 0 is a wall (since row 5, column 0 is '#'). So that's a collision with the wall. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n3. Turn RIGHT: direction is RIGHT. The head is at (5,1). Moving RIGHT would take it to (5,2). Let's check (5,2). The row 5 is \"# H AS #\", which is columns 0: #, 1:H, 2: (space), 3:A, 4:S, 5: (space), 6: #. So (5,2) is a space. So moving RIGHT would be (5,2). Check if that's a body part. The S's are at (5,4). So (5,2) is safe. So RIGHT is possible.\n\nNow, let's check apples. Are there apples in the possible next positions?\n\nCurrent apples (A's) on the board:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: no A (row 1 is #  SSS #)\nRow 2: no A\nRow 3: no A\nRow 4: position 6 is A (row 4: # S  SA# → (4,6))\nRow 5: position 3 is A (row 5: # H AS # → (5,3))\nRow 6: position 6 is A (row 6: #    SA# → (6,6))\n\nSo apples are at (4,6), (5,3), (6,6).\n\nIf we go DOWN: next head is (6,1). No apple there. So no growth, just move.\n\nIf we go RIGHT: next head is (5,2). No apple there. The apple in row 5 is at (5,3). So if we go RIGHT again next time, we can reach (5,3). But current move is to (5,2).\n\nIf we go DOWN, next position (6,1). Then, perhaps next moves can lead towards apples.\n\nAlternatively, what's the current direction. The snake is moving DOWN. So the next position is (6,1) if we keep direction. Let's check the body's movement. The snake's body is a chain. The head moves, each body part follows the previous one.\n\nBut maybe there's a better path. Let's think about the snake's body positions. The head is at (5,1). The body parts are connected. Let's try to trace the snake's body path.\n\nThe head is H at (5,1). The adjacent S's would be the next part. Let's look for S adjacent to H. The H is at (5,1). Adjacent cells: up (4,1), down (6,1), left (5,0: wall), right (5,2). The cell (4,1) is S (row 4: # S  SA# → (4,1) is S). So the next body part is (4,1). Then, from (4,1), adjacent S's. Let's check (4,1)'s neighbors. Up is (3,1), which is S (row 3: # S SS # → (3,1) is S). So (3,1) is next. Then (3,1) up is (2,1), which is S (row 2: # SSSS # → (2,1) is S). Then (2,1) up is (1,1), which is space (row 1: #  SSS # → (1,1) is space). Wait, (2,1) is S, (2,2) is S, (2,3) is S, (2,4) is S. So (2,1) is part of the body. So the body from H is (5,1) → (4,1) → (3,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (3,3) → (3,4) → (4,5) → (5,4) → (6,4) → (6,5). Let's count: H is 1, then 15 S's, so 16 segments. So the tail is at (6,5), perhaps. When the snake moves, the tail will move if no apple is eaten.\n\nSo, if the snake moves DOWN to (6,1), the new head is (6,1), the body parts shift: (5,1) becomes S, (4,1) becomes S, etc., and the tail (6,5) is removed (if no apple is eaten). So the new body would have (6,1) as H, (5,1) as S, (4,1) as S, (3,1) as S, (2,1) as S, (2,2) as S, (2,3) as S, (2,4) as S, (1,2) as S, (1,3) as S, (1,4) as S, (3,3) as S, (3,4) as S, (4,5) as S, (5,4) as S, (6,4) as S. So the tail would be (6,4) now? Maybe I'm getting the tail wrong, but the main point is whether the next position is safe.\n\nNow, the possible directions are DOWN, RIGHT (since LEFT leads to wall). Let's check for possible collisions in the next steps.\n\nIf we go RIGHT: head moves to (5,2). Is (5,2) safe? Yes. Then, the next possible direction could be RIGHT again (to (5,3), which is an apple). That would be good. Because (5,3) is A. So moving RIGHT now, then RIGHT again would let the snake eat the apple. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head (5,1). If direction is RIGHT, next head (5,2). Then, if next direction is RIGHT again (since current direction would be RIGHT, can't reverse to LEFT), then head moves to (5,3) which is A. Eating that apple would increase the score, and the snake grows. So that's a good path.\n\nBut wait, is (5,2) a valid move? Let's confirm. (5,2) is in row 5, column 2. The row 5 is \"# H AS #\", so the characters are [0]# [1]H [2] (space) [3]A [4]S [5] (space) [6]#. So (5,2) is a space, not a body part. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nIf we go DOWN, the next position is (6,1). Then, what's around (6,1)? Let's look at row 6: \"#    SA#\". So (6,1) is space, (6,2) is space, (6,3) is space, (6,4) is S, (6,5) is S, (6,6) is A. So (6,1) is safe, but then the next move could be DOWN again (to row 7, column 1). But row 7 is a wall (########), so (7,1) is a wall. So moving DOWN again would hit the wall. So after moving DOWN once, next direction can't be DOWN again (since row 7 is wall). So maybe after moving DOWN to (6,1), next possible directions are LEFT (but (6,0) is wall), RIGHT (to (6,2)), or UP (but can't reverse from DOWN to UP). So direction after DOWN would have to be RIGHT. So (6,1) → (6,2). Then (6,2) → (6,3), then (6,3) → (6,4) which is S (body). So that's a collision. So moving DOWN might lead to a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose RIGHT now, then (5,2). Then next move RIGHT to (5,3) (apple). That's better. Let's confirm (5,3) is A. Yes, row 5, column 3 is A. So moving RIGHT twice would get the apple. So first move RIGHT (to (5,2)), then next move RIGHT again (to (5,3)), which is an apple. That's a good plan.\n\nSo the best direction now is RIGHT. Because moving RIGHT allows the snake to approach the apple at (5,3) in the next step. Moving DOWN would not reach an apple soon and might lead to a wall. LEFT is invalid (wall). So the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SSS #\n# SSSS #\n# S SS #\n# S  SA#\n# H AS #\n#    SA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5,1) (row 5, column 1) and is currently moving DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot choose UP. The possible directions to consider are LEFT, RIGHT, or continuing DOWN.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,1) would take the head to (5,0), which is a wall (`#`). This would cause an immediate collision and end the game. LEFT is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5,1) would take the head to (6,1), which is a safe empty space (not a wall or body part). However, this position does not contain an apple, and continuing DOWN further would eventually hit the bottom wall (row 7 is a wall). This path does not lead to an apple quickly.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5,1) would take the head to (5,2), which is a safe empty space. From (5,2), the next move RIGHT would reach (5,3), which contains an apple (`A`). This path allows the snake to eat an apple in the next step, increasing the score and growing the snake.  \n\nThus, the optimal direction is RIGHT. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let me start by visualizing the board.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#'. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #  SSS # (so positions (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) are S)\nRow 2: # SSSS # (positions (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) are S)\nRow 3: # S SS # (positions (3,1) and (3,3), (3,4) are S)\nRow 4: # S  SA# (positions (4,1), (4,4) is S, (4,5) is A)\nRow 5: # SHAS # (positions (5,1) is S, (5,2) is H (head), (5,3) is A, (5,4) is S)\nRow 6: #     A# (position (6,5) is A)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving right. The head (H) is at row 5, column 2 (since rows are 0-based from top, columns 0-based from left). Wait, let's confirm coordinates. Let's index rows from 0 (top) to 7 (bottom), columns 0 (left) to 7 (right). So:\n\nRow 5 (since row 0 is top, row 5 is 6th row). Let's parse row 5: \"# SHAS #\". So positions:\n\nColumn 0: # (wall)\nColumn 1: S\nColumn 2: H (head)\nColumn 3: A (apple)\nColumn 4: S\nColumn 5: (space)\nColumn 6: # (wall)\nSo H is at (5,2). Current direction is RIGHT. So next move, the head would go to (5,3), which is A (apple). \n\nWait, the snake is moving RIGHT. So the next position of the head is current head's position (5,2) plus direction RIGHT (which is column +1). So (5,2+1) = (5,3). Let's check what's at (5,3): A. So if we move RIGHT, the head will eat the apple. That's good because it increases the score. Also, when the snake eats an apple, it grows in length. \n\nBut we need to check if moving RIGHT is allowed. The snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is RIGHT. Reversing would be LEFT, which is opposite. So allowed directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since current direction is RIGHT, can't go LEFT). Wait, the rule says \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, no, the example given: UP to DOWN is reverse. So if current direction is RIGHT, the reverse is LEFT, so the snake can't turn to LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since moving in the same direction is allowed). \n\nSo if we choose RIGHT, which is the current direction, the head moves to (5,3), which is an apple. Then, the snake grows. Let's think about the next state. The current snake's body is a chain. Let's figure out the snake's body segments. The head is at (5,2). The body parts (S) are connected. Let's track the snake's body:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 5: # SHAS # → positions (5,1) is S, (5,2) H, (5,3) A, (5,4) S. So (5,1) and (5,4) are S. \n\nRow 4: # S  SA# → (4,1) S, (4,4) S, (4,5) A. \n\nRow 3: # S SS # → (3,1) S, (3,3) S, (3,4) S.\n\nRow 2: # SSSS # → (2,1) S, (2,2) S, (2,3) S, (2,4) S.\n\nRow 1: #  SSS # → (1,2) S, (1,3) S, (1,4) S.\n\nSo the snake's body is a continuous path. Let's reconstruct the snake's segments. The head is at (5,2). Let's see where the next segment is. The snake moves in direction RIGHT, so the previous direction before RIGHT must have been such that the body follows. Alternatively, the body segments are the previous positions of the head as it moves. Since the snake's movement: when it moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the one in front. Except when it eats an apple, the tail doesn't move (so the length increases by 1). \n\nBut for collision, we need to check if the new head position is a wall or a body segment. Let's check the next position if moving RIGHT: (5,3). What's there? A (apple). So no collision. So moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nIf we move UP, direction would be UP. The head is at (5,2). Moving UP would take it to (4,2). Let's check (4,2): row 4 is \"# S  SA#\", so columns 0: #, 1: S, 2: (space), 3: (space), 4: S, 5: A, 6: #. So (4,2) is a space. Is that safe? Let's check if (4,2) is a body part. Looking at the board, (4,2) is empty (space), so no collision. But moving UP would change direction from RIGHT to UP, which is allowed (since not reverse). \n\nIf we move DOWN: head at (5,2) → (6,2). Row 6 is \"#     A#\", so (6,2) is space. No collision. \n\nBut moving RIGHT is better because it's an apple. Eating the apple increases the score. So the best choice is to continue moving RIGHT, which will eat the apple. \n\nSo the answer should be RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SSS #\n# SSSS #\n# S SS #\n# S  SA#\n# SHAS #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is located at position (5, 2) (row 5, column 2). The current direction is RIGHT, meaning the next move will be to (5, 3) if the direction remains RIGHT. \n\nChecking the target position (5, 3) in the current board: it contains an apple ('A'). Moving RIGHT will allow the snake to eat this apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake's length. \n\nThe snake cannot reverse direction (current direction is RIGHT, so reversing to LEFT is invalid). Moving UP or DOWN would not target an apple in the immediate next step, whereas moving RIGHT directly targets an apple without collision (the target position is not a wall or part of the snake's body). \n\nThus, the optimal direction is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's list out each row to visualize the snake's position, apples, and other elements.\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #  SSS #\nRow 2: # SSSS #\nRow 3: #AS SS #\nRow 4: # S  SA#\nRow 5: # SSHS #\nRow 6: #     A#\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nSo, the snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. Let's find the position of 'H'. Looking at row 5 (index 5), the row is \"# SSHS #\". Let's index each character in row 5 (since rows are 0-based from top, and columns 0-based from left):\n\nRow 5 characters (indices 0 to 7):\n0: #, 1:  , 2: S, 3: S, 4: H, 5: S, 6:  , 7: #\n\nSo the head 'H' is at (row 5, column 4). The current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is moving to the right. The next position the head would move to is (row 5, column 5), since moving right increases the column index by 1. Let's check what's at (5,5). Looking at row 5, column 5 is 'S' (from \"# SSHS #\", the characters are: positions 0: #, 1: space, 2: S, 3: S, 4: H, 5: S, 6: space, 7: #). So if the snake continues moving RIGHT, the head would hit its own body (S), which is a collision. That's bad, so we can't go RIGHT.\n\nNow, the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is RIGHT, so reversing would be LEFT. So the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing is not allowed). Wait, no: the rule says \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So, current direction is RIGHT. The reverse direction is LEFT. So the snake can't turn directly to LEFT. Wait, wait. Let me confirm. The example says, \"cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly.\" So, if moving UP, you can't turn to DOWN (reverse). If moving LEFT, you can't turn to RIGHT (reverse). So, for current direction RIGHT, the reverse is LEFT, so the snake cannot turn to LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (but that's a collision). Wait, the player can choose direction inputs, but they can't reverse. So, if current direction is RIGHT, the allowed next directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse). But in this case, moving RIGHT is into a body (S), which is a collision, so that's a loss. So we need to choose between UP, DOWN, or maybe LEFT (but LEFT is reverse, which is not allowed). Wait, let's clarify the movement rules again. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing. The player controls the direction by providing inputs. The snake cannot reverse direction. So, if the current direction is RIGHT, the next direction can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT is reverse). So the player can't choose LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. But moving RIGHT is into S (body), which is a collision, so that's invalid. So we need to check UP and DOWN.\n\nLet's find the head's position again: (row 5, column 4). Let's check the possible next positions:\n\n- If direction is UP: the new head position is (row 5 - 1, column 4) = (4,4). Let's check row 4: \"# S  SA#\". Row 4's columns 0-7: 0: #, 1: space, 2: S, 3: space, 4: space, 5: S, 6: A, 7: #. So (4,4) is a space (empty). So that's safe. Let's check if there's an apple there. (4,4) is space, so no apple. So the snake would move there, and the body would follow. But since no apple is eaten, the snake's length remains the same (so the tail would move).\n\n- If direction is DOWN: new head position is (5 + 1, column 4) = (6,4). Row 6 is \"#     A#\". Columns 0-7: 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4: space, 5: space, 6: A, 7: #. So (6,4) is a space. So that's safe. No apple there. So moving DOWN would be safe.\n\nWait, but let's check if there are apples in the board. The apples are 'A's. Let's list all 'A's:\n\nRow 1: #  SSS # → no A.\nRow 2: # SSSS # → no A.\nRow 3: #AS SS # → (3,1) is A (since row 3 is \"#AS SS #\": columns 0: #, 1: A, 2: S, 3: S, 4: space, 5: S, 6: S, 7: #). So (3,1) is A.\nRow 4: \"# S  SA#\" → column 6 is A. (4,6) is A.\nRow 6: \"#     A#\" → column 6 is A. (6,6) is A.\n\nSo apples are at (3,1), (4,6), (6,6).\n\nNow, the head is at (5,4). Let's check possible moves:\n\n- UP: (4,4). Is that an apple? No. (4,4) is space.\n- DOWN: (6,4). Space. No apple.\n- RIGHT: (5,5) → S (body) → collision.\n- LEFT: reverse direction (current is RIGHT), so not allowed. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP or DOWN. Now, we need to choose between them. Let's check the next steps to avoid future collisions. Let's think about the snake's body positions to see if moving UP or DOWN leads to a safe path.\n\nFirst, let's map all the S positions (body and head, but H is the head). Let's list all coordinates of 'S' and 'H':\n\nRow 1: #  SSS # → columns 2,3,4 (since \"#  SSS #\": 0: #, 1: space, 2: S, 3: S, 4: S, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #). So (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\nRow 2: # SSSS # → columns 1,2,3,4 (since \"# SSSS #\": 0: #, 1: S, 2: S, 3: S, 4: S, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #). So (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\nRow 3: #AS SS # → columns 2,3,5,6 (since \"#AS SS #\": 0: #, 1: A, 2: S, 3: S, 4: space, 5: S, 6: S, 7: #). So (3,2), (3,3), (3,5), (3,6).\nRow 4: \"# S  SA#\" → columns 2,5 (since \"# S  SA#\": 0: #, 1: space, 2: S, 3: space, 4: space, 5: S, 6: A, 7: #). So (4,2), (4,5).\nRow 5: # SSHS # → columns 2,3,5 (since \"# SSHS #\": 0: #, 1: space, 2: S, 3: S, 4: H, 5: S, 6: space, 7: #). So (5,2), (5,3), (5,5).\nH is at (5,4).\n\nSo the snake's body is in all those S positions, and the head is at (5,4). The snake's length is the number of S and H, which is (row1:3) + (row2:4) + (row3:4) + (row4:2) + (row5:3) → 3+4=7, 7+4=11, 11+2=13, 13+3=16. Plus H (1), total length 17? Because each S is part of the body, and H is the head. So the snake's body is 16 segments, head is 1, total length 17. So when moving, the snake's body follows: the head moves to new position, each body part moves to the previous position of the part in front of it. So the tail (the last part) would move if no apple is eaten.\n\nNow, if the snake moves UP to (4,4):\n\nThe new head is (4,4). The next body parts would shift. Let's see: the previous positions of the body. The head was at (5,4). The next part (the first body segment) is probably (5,3) (since in row 5, the positions are 2:S, 3:S, 4:H, 5:S. So the order of the snake's body could be: H at (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4?), wait, maybe I need to reconstruct the snake's path. Alternatively, perhaps the snake is arranged in a way that the body segments are connected. For example, H is at (5,4). The adjacent S's would be part of the body. Let's check adjacent cells to H (5,4). The cells around H are:\n\nUp: (4,4) (space)\nDown: (6,4) (space)\nLeft: (5,3) (S)\nRight: (5,5) (S)\n\nSo the body segments adjacent to H are (5,3) (left) and (5,5) (right). But since the current direction is RIGHT, the snake was moving right. So the previous head position would have been (5,3), and then moved to (5,4). So the body after H is (5,3), then (5,2), etc. Because when moving right, the head moves from (5,3) to (5,4), so the body at (5,3) is the next segment. Let's confirm:\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So the movement before this step would have been: the head was at (5,3), moved right to (5,4), making (5,3) part of the body, and the rest of the body follows. So the snake's body is in the order: H at (5,4) → (5,3) → (5,2) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (2,3) → (2,2) → (2,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (2,4) → (3,4) (but row 3, column 4 is space?), maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snake's body is a contiguous chain. Let's list all S positions and H and see their connections.\n\nH is at (5,4). Let's look for S's adjacent to H. (5,3) is S (left of H), (5,5) is S (right of H), (4,4) is space (up), (6,4) is space (down). So H has S to the left and right. Since the current direction is RIGHT, the snake is moving right, which implies that the next position would be (5,5), but that's S (body), so collision. But how did the snake get to (5,4)? The previous position of the head must have been (5,3), moving right to (5,4). So (5,3) was the previous head, now part of the body. So the body segments after (5,3) would be (5,2), (4,2), etc. Let's see (5,2) is S (row 5, column 2: yes). (4,2) is S (row 4, column 2: yes). (3,2) is S (row 3, column 2: yes). (3,3) is S (row 3, column 3: yes). (2,3) is S (row 2, column 3: yes). (2,2) is S (row 2, column 2: yes). (2,1) is S (row 2, column 1: yes). (1,2) is S (row 1, column 2: yes). (1,3) is S (row 1, column 3: yes). (1,4) is S (row 1, column 4: yes). (2,4) is S (row 2, column 4: yes). (3,5) is S (row 3, column 5: yes). (3,6) is S (row 3, column 6: yes). (4,5) is S (row 4, column 5: yes). (5,5) is S (row 5, column 5: yes). \n\nSo the snake's body is a long chain. Let's try to trace the path. Starting at H (5,4):\n\nPrevious head position (since moving RIGHT) was (5,3). Then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4?) (row 3, column 4 is space, maybe (2,4) connects to (3,4) which is space. Alternatively, perhaps (1,4) connects to (2,4) (row 2, column 4 is S). (2,4) is S. Then (2,4) connects to (3,4) (space, no), (3,5) (row 3, column 5 is S). So (2,4) → (3,5). (3,5) → (3,6) (S). (3,6) → (4,6) (A, which is not S). (4,6) is A. (4,5) is S (row 4, column 5). So (4,5) connects to (5,5) (S). (5,5) is S, adjacent to H (5,4). So the snake's body forms a loop? Because (5,5) is S next to H (5,4), and (5,3) is S next to H (5,4). So the snake is in a looped shape, which is dangerous because moving into any of those S's would cause collision.\n\nNow, back to possible directions. If we choose UP, the head moves to (4,4). Let's check if (4,4) is safe. Yes, it's a space. Then the next body segment (5,4) becomes S, and the rest of the body shifts. The tail (the last segment) would move, but since we didn't eat an apple, the length stays the same. So the tail would leave its previous position. Let's see where the tail is. The tail is the last segment of the snake. Since the snake is long, the tail could be at one of the ends. For example, if the snake's path is H (5,4) → (5,3) → (5,2) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (2,3) → (2,2) → (2,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (2,4) → (3,5) → (3,6) → (4,5) → (5,5) → ... but where does it end? Let's count the number of S and H. Let's count all S and H:\n\nRow 1: 3 S → (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\nRow 2: 4 S → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: 4 S → (3,2), (3,3), (3,5), (3,6)\nRow 4: 2 S → (4,2), (4,5)\nRow 5: 3 S and 1 H → (5,2), (5,3), (5,5), (5,4) (H)\nTotal: 3+4+4+2+3 = 16 S, plus 1 H → 17 segments. So the tail is the 17th segment. Let's see the order. The head is the first segment. The next is (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (5,5). That's 16 segments after the head. So the tail is (5,5). So when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (5,5) would be removed (turn into space), and the new head is (4,4). So the new positions would be:\n\nHead at (4,4). Then (5,4) becomes S (previous head), (5,3) remains S, (5,2) remains S, (4,2) remains S, (3,2) remains S, (3,3) remains S, (2,3) remains S, (2,2) remains S, (2,1) remains S, (1,2) remains S, (1,3) remains S, (1,4) remains S, (2,4) remains S, (3,5) remains S, (3,6) remains S, (4,5) remains S. The tail (5,5) becomes space. Let's check if (4,4) is adjacent to any S in the new positions. (4,4) is up of (5,4) (which is now S). So (4,4) is adjacent to (5,4) (S), but since that's the new body position, that's okay. The snake's body is connected properly.\n\nIf we choose DOWN, the head moves to (6,4). Let's check (6,4) in row 6: \"#     A#\". So (6,4) is space. Then the new head is (6,4). The previous head (5,4) becomes S. The tail (5,5) would become space (since no apple is eaten). The body segments shift. The new positions would have head at (6,4), (5,4) as S, and the rest as before. (6,4) is in row 6, which is otherwise empty except for (6,6) which is A. So moving DOWN to (6,4) is safe. \n\nNow, the goal is to eat apples. Let's see where the apples are. Apples are at (3,1), (4,6), (6,6). Let's see if moving UP or DOWN can lead the snake towards an apple.\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (4,4), the next possible moves could be towards (4,6) (apple at (4,6)). From (4,4), moving right would go to (4,5), which is S (current S at (4,5)), so collision. So can't go right. Moving up from (4,4) would be (3,4), which in row 3 is \"#AS SS #\". Row 3, column 4 is space. So (3,4) is space. Then from (3,4), possible directions. Let's see, (3,1) is an apple. To reach (3,1), the snake would need to move left from (3,4) to (3,3) (S, collision?), (3,2) (S, collision). So maybe that's not easy.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (6,4), then next possible direction could be RIGHT towards (6,5), (6,6) (apple). (6,6) is A. So moving DOWN, then RIGHT (if possible) could reach the apple at (6,6). Let's see:\n\nCurrent head at (5,4). If we move DOWN to (6,4) (safe). Then the next direction could be RIGHT (since current direction would now be DOWN, so the next direction can't be UP (reverse), but can be RIGHT, LEFT, or DOWN. So from (6,4), moving RIGHT to (6,5) (space), then again RIGHT to (6,6) (A). That would allow the snake to eat the apple at (6,6). That's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (4,4) would be (4,4). Then the next direction could be UP to (3,4) (space). From (3,4), moving LEFT towards (3,3) (S, collision), (3,2) (S, collision). So that path might not lead to apples quickly.\n\nSo moving DOWN seems better because it can lead towards the apple at (6,6) in the next steps. Also, moving RIGHT is a collision, so that's invalid. Moving LEFT is reverse direction, which is not allowed. So the best options are UP or DOWN. Between them, DOWN seems better as it can approach an apple.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SSS #\n# SSSS #\n#AS SS #\n# S  SA#\n# SSHS #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (row 5, column 4), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Moving RIGHT would collide with the snake's own body (S at (5,5)), which is a loss. Thus, the valid directions are UP or DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of UP:\n- New head position: (4, 4) (row 4, column 4). This cell is empty (space), so no collision. However, there is no apple here, and this path does not immediately lead toward any visible apples (apples are at (3,1), (4,6), (6,6)).\n\n### Analysis of DOWN:\n- New head position: (6, 4) (row 6, column 4). This cell is empty (space), so no collision. This direction moves the snake toward the apple at (6,6) (row 6, column 6). From (6,4), subsequent RIGHT moves could reach (6,6) to eat the apple, making this a more favorable path.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to look at the current game board and the current direction. The current direction is DOWN, and the epoch is 58, which is well before 100, so the game isn't ending yet.\n\nLet me start by visualizing the game board. The board is 8x8, surrounded by '#' walls. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: #  SSS # (so columns 2,3,4 are S)\nRow 2: # SSSS # (columns 1,2,3,4 are S)\nRow 3: #AS SS # (columns 1 is A, 2 is S, 3 is S, 5 is S)\nRow 4: # S  SA# (columns 1 is S, 4 is S, 5 is A)\nRow 5: # SSS  # (columns 1,2,3 are S)\nRow 6: #   H A# (columns 3 is H, 5 is A)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe snake's head is at row 6, column 3 (since H is there). The current direction is DOWN. So, the snake is moving down. Let's check where the next position would be if it continues DOWN. The head is in row 6 (since rows are 0-7, row 6 is the 7th row). Moving DOWN would take it to row 7. But row 7 is the bottom wall (all #), so that's a collision. Oh right, so moving DOWN now would hit the wall, which ends the game. So we can't choose DOWN.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is DOWN, reversing would be UP. So the snake can't turn directly to UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (but that's a wall). Wait, no: the rule says \"cannot reverse direction (i.e., cannot turn UP to DOWN or LEFT to RIGHT directly)\". Wait, the example says \"the snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly)\". Wait, maybe I misread. Let's check: reversing direction would be if current direction is UP, then turning DOWN. If current is DOWN, turning UP is reverse. If current is LEFT, turning RIGHT is reverse. If current is RIGHT, turning LEFT is reverse. So, in this case, current direction is DOWN. So the snake can't turn to UP (reverse). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (but DOWN is a wall). So options are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's find the head's position: (row 6, column 3). Let's note coordinates as (row, column), rows 0-7, columns 0-7 (since each row is 8 characters, including the # at start and end). So row 6 is the 7th row (0-based), column 3 (since the row is \"#   H A#\", so positions 0 is #, 1 is space, 2 is space, 3 is H, 4 is space, 5 is A, 6 is space, 7 is #). So H is at (6,3).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So moving DOWN would take head to (7,3). But row 7 is all #, so that's a wall collision. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (but UP is reverse, so allowed? Wait, the rule says \"cannot reverse direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly)\". Wait, the example says, \"the snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly)\". So, perhaps \"reverse\" is 180-degree turn. So if current direction is UP, you can't go DOWN. If current is DOWN, you can't go UP. If current is LEFT, can't go RIGHT. Current is RIGHT, can't go LEFT. So in this case, current direction is DOWN, so you can't choose UP (reverse). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (but DOWN is wall). So only LEFT or RIGHT are possible.\n\nLet's check LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nFirst, direction LEFT: moving left would take the head from (6,3) to (6,2). What's in (6,2)? The row 6 is \"#   H A#\", which is:\n\nIndices 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: H, 4: ' ', 5: A, 6: ' ', 7: #. So (6,2) is ' ', which is empty. So that's safe.\n\nThen, direction RIGHT: moving right from (6,3) to (6,4). (6,4) is ' ' (since row 6 is \"#   H A#\", column 4 is space). So that's also safe.\n\nNow, need to check if moving LEFT or RIGHT would cause collision with the snake's body.\n\nThe snake's body is represented by 'S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: #  SSS # → columns 2,3,4 (row 1, columns 2,3,4) → (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\nRow 2: # SSSS # → columns 1,2,3,4 → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: #AS SS # → columns 1 (A), 2 (S), 3 (S), 5 (S) → (3,2), (3,3), (3,5)\nRow 4: # S  SA# → columns 1 (S), 4 (S), 5 (A) → (4,1), (4,4)\nRow 5: # SSS  # → columns 1,2,3 → (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\nRow 6: #   H A# → H is (6,3), others are spaces except A at (6,5)\n\nSo all S positions are:\n\n(1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n(3,2), (3,3), (3,5)\n(4,1), (4,4)\n(5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n\nNow, moving LEFT: head goes to (6,2). Is (6,2) an S? Looking at the S positions, none of them are (6,2). So safe.\n\nMoving RIGHT: head goes to (6,4). Check S positions. (6,4) is not in any S positions. So safe.\n\nNow, check if there's an apple in the next position. Let's see.\n\nCurrent apples are 'A's. Let's list A positions:\n\nRow 3: column 1 (row 3, column 1) → (3,1)\nRow 4: column 5 (row 4, column 5) → (4,5)\nRow 6: column 5 (row 6, column 5) → (6,5)\n\nSo apples are at (3,1), (4,5), (6,5).\n\nIf moving LEFT: (6,2) → no apple.\n\nIf moving RIGHT: (6,4) → no apple. So neither direction immediately eats an apple.\n\nBut maybe we need to look ahead for possible paths to apples. Let's see where the apples are.\n\nThe closest apple is at (6,5) (current head is at (6,3), so that's two steps to the right (RIGHT, then RIGHT again). Let's see if that path is possible.\n\nCurrent head is (6,3). If we go RIGHT now (direction RIGHT), next head position is (6,4). Then, next move (epoch 59), the direction can be changed (but not reversed). The new direction would be whatever we choose. If we go RIGHT again, then head would be (6,5), which is the apple. That would be good. So moving RIGHT now allows us to reach the apple at (6,5) in the next step.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now (to (6,2)), then what's next? The next direction could be UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (but can't reverse). If we move LEFT, the current direction would be LEFT, so next direction can't be RIGHT. Let's see where (6,2) is. Then, possible next moves:\n\nIf direction is LEFT (current direction after moving LEFT), next step would be (6,1). (6,1) is space. Then, perhaps. But there's no apple in that direction.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT then UP: (6,2) → (5,2). (5,2) is S (since row 5 is # SSS  #, which has S at (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)). Oh! (5,2) is S. So if we move LEFT to (6,2), then next direction could be UP. But (5,2) is part of the snake's body (from row 5: columns 1,2,3 are S). So (5,2) is S. So moving UP from (6,2) would hit the body. So that's a collision.\n\nSo moving LEFT might lead to a dead end. Let's check the possible paths.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (6,4). Then, next move, the direction could be RIGHT again (since current direction would be RIGHT, and we can choose directions except LEFT (reverse)). So moving RIGHT again would take us to (6,5), which is the apple. That's good. Because (6,5) is A. So if we go RIGHT now, then next step (epoch 59), direction RIGHT again, we reach the apple. Then, the snake would eat it, grow, and the score increases. That's a good move.\n\nWhat about other apples? The apple at (4,5) is in row 4, column 5. The head is at row 6, column 3. To get there, maybe moving up. But current direction is DOWN, so moving up is reverse. So can't do that now. But if we first move RIGHT to (6,4), then maybe UP? Let's see.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (6,4), the current direction is RIGHT. Then, next direction could be UP (since reverse of RIGHT is LEFT, so UP is allowed). So direction UP from (6,4) would take us to (5,4). What's (5,4)? Row 5 is \"# SSS  #\", which is columns 1-3 S, column 4 is space. So (5,4) is space. Then, moving UP again (direction UP) to (4,4). (4,4) is S (from row 4: # S  SA#, column 4 is S). Oh, (4,4) is S. So that's a collision. So that path is bad.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,4), direction RIGHT to (6,5) (the apple), which is safe. So that's the best immediate path.\n\nAnother apple is at (3,1). That's in row 3, column 1. That's further away, and probably not reachable without hitting the body.\n\nSo the best move is to go RIGHT now, so that next step we can reach the apple at (6,5). Let's confirm.\n\nCurrent head (6,3). Direction RIGHT: next position (6,4). That's safe (no S, no wall). Then, next move (epoch 59), direction RIGHT again: head (6,5), which is A. So that's good. So moving RIGHT now is the best option.\n\nWhat if we move LEFT? Let's see. (6,3) → (6,2). Then, next direction options (since current direction is LEFT, can't go RIGHT). Possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nIf direction LEFT again: (6,1). That's space. Then, next direction LEFT again: (6,0), which is # (wall). So collision. So that's bad.\n\nIf direction UP from (6,2): (5,2). (5,2) is S (from row 5's SSS). So collision.\n\nIf direction DOWN from (6,2): (7,2). Row 7 is wall, so collision. So moving LEFT leads to possible collision in next steps. So moving LEFT is not good.\n\nSo the best direction is RIGHT.\n\n\n########\n#  SSS #\n# SSSS #\n#AS SS #\n# S  SA#\n# SSS  #\n#   H A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 6, column 3).  \n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving DOWN, but moving DOWN further would take the head to row 7 (a wall), causing a collision. Thus, DOWN is invalid.  \n3. **Reversing Direction**: The snake cannot reverse direction (DOWN → UP is reversed), so UP is also invalid.  \n4. **Possible Directions**: Only LEFT or RIGHT are valid.  \n\n### Analysis of LEFT:  \nMoving LEFT would take the head to (6, 2) (a space, no collision). However:  \n- Next possible moves from (6, 2) would be UP (to (5, 2), which is part of the snake's body 'S'), DOWN (to (7, 2), a wall), or LEFT (to (6, 1), then further LEFT to (6, 0), a wall). All paths from LEFT lead to collisions.  \n\n### Analysis of RIGHT:  \nMoving RIGHT would take the head to (6, 4) (a space, no collision). From (6, 4):  \n- The next move can be RIGHT again, taking the head to (6, 5), which contains an apple 'A'. Eating this apple would grow the snake and increase the score. This path is safe and leads to an apple.  \n\nThus, moving RIGHT is the optimal choice.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#  SSS #\n# SSSS #\n#AS SS #\n# S   A#\n# SSS  #\n#   SHA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT, and we're at epoch 59. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. Let's locate the head. Looking at the last row (since rows are 0 to 7, I'll count from top to bottom):\n\nRow 6 (since the first line is row 0, and the last is row 7, but let's check the input again. The given board lines are:\n\nLine 0: ######## (row 0)\nLine 1: #  SSS # (row 1)\nLine 2: # SSSS # (row 2)\nLine 3: #AS SS # (row 3)\nLine 4: # S   A# (row 4)\nLine 5: # SSS  # (row 5)\nLine 6: #   SHA# (row 6)\nLine 7: ######## (row 7)\n\nSo row 6 is the 7th line (index 6). In row 6, the characters are \"#   SHA#\". Let's index each position (columns 0 to 7):\n\nColumn 0: # (wall)\nColumn 1: space\nColumn 2: space\nColumn 3: S\nColumn 4: H\nColumn 5: A\nColumn 6: # (wall)\nColumn 7: (end, but the line is 8 characters, so column 7 is the last #)\n\nWait, let's parse row 6 correctly. The line is \"#   SHA#\" — that's 8 characters. Let's list each column (0-7):\n\n0: #\n1: ' ' (space)\n2: ' '\n3: 'S'\n4: 'H'\n5: 'A'\n6: '#'\n7: ? Wait, no. The line is 8 characters. Let's count: \"#\", \" \", \" \", \" \", \"S\", \"H\", \"A\", \"#\" — maybe I miscounted. Let's check again. The user wrote \"#   SHA#\". Let's split into individual characters:\n\nCharacter 0: #\nCharacter 1: ' '\nCharacter 2: ' '\nCharacter 3: ' '\nCharacter 4: 'S'\nCharacter 5: 'H'\nCharacter 6: 'A'\nCharacter 7: '#'\n\nYes, that's 8 characters. So row 6, column 5 is 'H' (head position). So head is at (row=6, column=5). The current direction is RIGHT. So the snake is moving to the right. Let's see where the next position would be if it continues RIGHT. The next position would be (row=6, column=6). But column 6 is a wall (since row 6, column 6 is '#'). So moving RIGHT would hit the wall, causing a collision. That's bad. So we can't go RIGHT.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is RIGHT, so the opposite direction is LEFT. So the snake can't turn LEFT (since reversing is not allowed). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. But RIGHT is a wall. So options are UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check the possible directions. Let's first check UP. Moving UP would take the head from (6,5) to (5,5). Let's check row 5: \"# SSS  #\". Let's parse row 5 (row index 5). The line is \"# SSS  #\". Columns 0-7:\n\n0: #\n1: ' '\n2: 'S'\n3: 'S'\n4: 'S'\n5: ' '\n6: ' '\n7: '#'\n\nSo row 5, column 5 is a space. So (5,5) is empty. So moving UP would be safe.\n\nNow check DOWN. Moving DOWN from (6,5) would go to (7,5). But row 7 is all walls (########), so column 5 in row 7 is '#', which is a wall. So moving DOWN would hit the wall. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP (since RIGHT and DOWN are walls, LEFT is reverse). Let's confirm. Current direction is RIGHT, so can't reverse to LEFT. So possible moves are UP, RIGHT, DOWN. But RIGHT is wall (row 6, column 6 is #), DOWN is row 7, column 5 is # (wall). So only UP is possible.\n\nWait, but let's confirm the head's current position again. Let's recheck row 6: \"#   SHA#\". So positions are:\n\nColumns 0: #\n\n1: ' '\n\n2: ' '\n\n3: ' '\n\n4: 'S' (body)\n\n5: 'H' (head)\n\n6: 'A' (apple)\n\n7: '#'\n\nSo head is at (6,5). Current direction is RIGHT. So moving RIGHT would take head to (6,6), which is 'A' (apple). Wait, wait! Oh! Because row 6, column 6 is 'A'? Let me recheck the row 6. The user wrote \"#   SHA#\". Let's split into each character:\n\nThe string is \"#   SHA#\". Let's index each character (0-7):\n\n0: #\n\n1: ' ' (space)\n\n2: ' ' (space)\n\n3: ' ' (space)\n\n4: 'S'\n\n5: 'H'\n\n6: 'A'\n\n7: '#'\n\nYes! So (6,5) is H, (6,6) is A. So moving RIGHT (current direction) would take the head to (6,6), which is an apple. Oh, I made a mistake earlier. The wall is at column 7. So (6,6) is A. So moving RIGHT would eat the apple. That's good. Because when the snake moves, it moves into the next square. So if the next square is A, it's safe (since it's not a wall or body), and the snake eats the apple, grows, and the score increases.\n\nWait, so the head is at (6,5), direction RIGHT. The next position is (6,6), which is 'A' (apple). So moving RIGHT is possible. Then, the next position is (6,6), which is A. So the snake would eat the apple. That's safe. So why did I think it's a wall? Because the row ends with #, which is column 7. So (6,6) is A, (6,7) is #. So moving RIGHT (from (6,5) to (6,6)) is into A, which is safe.\n\nSo the initial mistake was thinking (6,6) is a wall, but it's actually the apple. That's a critical error. Let's correct that.\n\nSo the current head position is (row=6, column=5). Current direction is RIGHT. The next square in the direction of RIGHT is (6,6), which is 'A'. So moving RIGHT would be safe, and the snake would eat the apple. So that's a good move.\n\nNow, what about the other directions. The snake can't reverse direction. So from RIGHT, can't go LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nCheck UP: moving UP from (6,5) would go to (5,5). Let's check row 5, column 5. Row 5 is \"# SSS  #\". Let's split into columns:\n\n0: #\n\n1: ' '\n\n2: 'S'\n\n3: 'S'\n\n4: 'S'\n\n5: ' ' (column 5)\n\n6: ' '\n\n7: '#'\n\nSo (5,5) is a space. So moving UP is possible, but there's no apple there. So that's a possible direction but not as good as eating the apple.\n\nCheck DOWN: moving DOWN from (6,5) would go to (7,5). Row 7 is ########, so column 5 is '#', which is a wall. So moving DOWN would hit the wall, game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nCheck LEFT: reversing direction (from RIGHT to LEFT is not allowed). So can't go LEFT.\n\nSo the options are RIGHT (eat apple, safe), UP (move to empty space, safe), or DOWN (wall, game over). So the best move is RIGHT, because it allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score and growing. Since the current epoch is 59 (out of 100), there's still time, but eating apples is the goal.\n\nSo the correct direction is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  SSS #\n# SSSS #\n#AS SS #\n# S   A#\n# SSS  #\n#   SHA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is located at row 6, column 5. The current direction is RIGHT. \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (6,5) leads to (6,6), which is an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body) and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP from (6,5) leads to (5,5), which is an empty space. This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (6,5) leads to (7,5), which is a wall ('#'). This would cause a collision and end the game.  \n- **LEFT**: Reversing direction (from RIGHT to LEFT) is not allowed.  \n\nThe optimal move is to continue in the current direction (RIGHT) to eat the apple and grow. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by parsing the game board.\n\nThe board is 8x8, with '#' as walls. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S', apples are 'A'. The current direction is RIGHT, and we're at epoch 60 (so 40 epochs left). The snake can't reverse direction, so from RIGHT, the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since reversing to LEFT is not allowed).\n\nLet's map out the board row by row. Let's index rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7), and columns 0 to 7 (left to right).\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # ASSS # → columns 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 2: # SSSS # → columns 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 3: #AS SS # → columns 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 4: # S   A# → columns 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 5: # SSS  # → columns 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 6: #   SSH# → columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'H', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nNow, find the head 'H' position. In row 6, column 5. So head is at (6,5). The current direction is RIGHT, so the next position if moving RIGHT would be (6,6). Let's check that square. Looking at row 6, column 6 is ' ' (since row 6 is #   SSH# → columns 0 is #, 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is 'S', 4 is 'S', 5 is 'H', 6 is ' ', 7 is #). So (6,6) is empty. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (6,6). Then, the snake's body would shift: the previous positions (the body segments) would follow. Since the snake's length is the number of 'S' plus 1 (the head). Let's count the 'S's:\n\nRow 1: 'SSS' → 3 S\nRow 2: 'SSSS' → 4 S\nRow 3: 'S' (column 2) and 'SS' (columns 4,5) → 3 S\nRow 4: 'S' (column 1) → 1 S\nRow 5: 'SSS' (columns 1-3) → 3 S\nRow 6: 'SS' (columns 3-4) → 2 S\nTotal S: 3+4+3+1+3+2= 16. So snake length is 17 (16 S + H). So when moving, the head moves to new position, and the tail (the last S) is removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nNow, check possible directions. Current direction is RIGHT. Can't reverse to LEFT. So possible directions: RIGHT, UP, DOWN.\n\nLet's check each direction:\n\n1. RIGHT: next head position (6,6). What's there? ' ' (empty). So snake moves. The new head is (6,6). The body segments shift. The tail (the oldest part) would be removed. Let's see if there's any collision. The new head (6,6) is within the walls (row 6 is 0-7, column 6 is 0-7, so not hitting walls). Check if (6,6) is a body part. Current body positions are all the 'S's. (6,6) is not an 'S', so no collision. So this is safe. But no apple here, so no growth.\n\n2. UP: direction is UP. Current head is (6,5). Moving UP would take it to (5,5). Let's check (5,5). Row 5 is # SSS  # → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (5,5) is ' ' (empty). No collision (walls: row 5 is within 0-7, column 5 is 0-7). Check if (5,5) is a body part. Current body positions: looking at row 5, columns 1-3 are S. (5,5) is not S, so safe. So moving UP is possible. No apple here, so no growth.\n\n3. DOWN: direction is DOWN. Head is (6,5). Moving DOWN would go to (7,5). But row 7 is all '#' (wall). So (7,5) is a wall. Collision. Game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are RIGHT and UP. Now, check if moving in these directions leads to apples.\n\nCurrent apples: need to count 'A's on the board.\n\nRow 1: column 2 is 'A' → (1,2)\nRow 3: column 1 is 'A' → (3,1)\nRow 4: column 5 is 'A' → (4,5)\nSo three apples.\n\nCheck the next positions:\n\nFor RIGHT: (6,6) is empty. No apple.\n\nFor UP: (5,5) is empty. No apple.\n\nWhat's the next step? Maybe look for the path to the apples. Let's see where the apples are.\n\nApple at (1,2), (3,1), (4,5).\n\nHead is at (6,5). Let's see the positions of the apples:\n\nApple (4,5) is in row 4, column 5. That's directly above the head's current position (6,5). The path from (6,5) to (4,5) would be moving UP twice. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head (6,5). If we move UP, head goes to (5,5). Then next move (if direction remains UP), head would go to (4,5), which is the apple (4,5) is 'A'. So that's an apple. So if we choose UP now, next move can be UP again (since direction can be maintained) to reach the apple.\n\nBut wait, need to check if the path is clear. Let's see (5,5) is empty. Then (4,5) is the apple. So moving UP now (to (5,5)), then next direction UP (to (4,5)) would eat the apple. That's a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now (to (6,6)), then what's next? Let's see (6,6) is empty. Then next direction could be UP (from RIGHT, can turn UP). (6,6) → (5,6). Let's check (5,6) in row 5: # SSS  # → column 6 is ' ', so (5,6) is empty. Then moving UP again to (4,6). Row 4 is # S   A# → column 6 is ' ', so (4,6) is empty. Not helpful. Alternatively, moving RIGHT again would go to (6,7), which is a wall (column 7 is #), so that's invalid. So moving RIGHT might not lead to an apple quickly.\n\nSo the best direction is UP, to position (5,5), then next move UP to (4,5) to eat the apple. So the current direction choice should be UP.\n\nWait, but let's check the body positions. When moving UP to (5,5), we need to make sure that (5,5) isn't part of the snake's body. Current body in row 5 is columns 1-3 (SSS). So (5,5) is column 5, which is empty. So no collision. So UP is safe.\n\nSo the answer is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# ASSS #\n# SSSS #\n#AS SS #\n# S   A#\n# SSS  #\n#   SSH#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction (RIGHT), and possible moves (RIGHT, UP, DOWN; reversing to LEFT is invalid). \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 6, column 5).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse to LEFT.\n- **Possible Moves**:\n  - **RIGHT**: Next head position is (6, 6), which is empty (no collision, no apple).\n  - **UP**: Next head position is (5, 5), which is empty (no collision, no apple).\n  - **DOWN**: Next head position is (7, 5), which is a wall (collision, game over).\n\n### Strategy:\nThe goal is to reach apples safely. The closest apple is at (row 4, column 5). Moving UP from (6, 5) to (5, 5) positions the snake to move UP again in the next epoch, reaching (4, 5) (the apple). This path avoids collisions and leads to an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board. The board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S', and apples are 'A'.\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the epoch is 61 (so 39 more moves before the game ends). The snake can't reverse direction, so if current direction is UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFirst, I need to find the position of the head 'H'. Let's parse the board row by row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # ASSS # → columns 1 to 6. Let's index columns from 1 to 6 (since row 0 and 7 are walls). So row 1, columns 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ' (assuming spaces are empty except where noted)\nRow 2: # SSSS # → columns 1-6: S, S, S, S, ' ', ' ' (maybe)\nRow 3: #AS S  # → columns 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' '\nRow 4: # S   A# → columns 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: 'A'\nRow 5: # SSS H# → columns 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: 'H' → So the head is at (5,6) (row 5, column 6)\nRow 6: #   SSS# → columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S'\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nWait, rows are 0-based? Let's confirm. The input shows the board as 8 rows. So row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom.\n\nSo the head 'H' is in row 5, column 6. Because row 5 is \"# SSS H#\", which when split, the characters are: index 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is 'S', 3 is 'S', 4 is 'S', 5 is ' ', 6 is 'H', 7 is '#'. So column 6 (since columns 0 and 7 are walls). So head position is (row=5, col=6).\n\nCurrent direction is UP. So the next move, if direction remains UP, the head would move to (row=4, col=6). Let's check what's in (4,6). Looking at row 4: \"# S   A#\" → columns 1-6. Column 6 is 'A' (since row 4 is \"# S   A#\", so positions: 0='#', 1=' ', 2='S', 3=' ', 4=' ', 5=' ', 6='A', 7='#'). So (row=4, col=6) is 'A' → that's an apple. So moving UP would eat the apple. That's good because it increases the score and the snake grows. \n\nBut we need to check if moving UP is possible. The next position (row=4, col=6) is within the board (since row 4 is between 0 and 7, column 6 is between 0 and 7). So no wall collision. Also, we need to check if that position is part of the snake's body. The current snake's body is 'S's. Let's see: (4,6) is 'A', so no 'S' there. So moving UP is safe.\n\nWhat if we choose LEFT or RIGHT? Let's check. The snake can't reverse direction (current direction is UP, so can't go DOWN). So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: the head would move to (5,5). Let's check (5,5): row 5 is \"# SSS H#\", column 5 is ' ' (since positions are 0:'#', 1:' ', 2:'S', 3:'S', 4:'S', 5:' ', 6:'H', 7:'#'). So (5,5) is empty. But is that a safe move? We need to check if that square is part of the snake's body. Let's check the body positions. The body is all 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1: # ASSS # → columns 2: 'A', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S' → (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\nRow 2: # SSSS # → columns 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S' → (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\nRow 3: #AS S  # → columns 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 4: 'S' → (3,2), (3,4)\nRow 4: # S   A# → column 2: 'S' → (4,2)\nRow 5: # SSS H# → columns 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S' → (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)\nRow 6: #   SSS# → columns 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S' → (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSo (5,5) is (row 5, column 5). Looking at the list above, none of the 'S's are at (5,5). So moving LEFT would take the head to (5,5), which is empty. But there's no apple there. So that's a safe move but doesn't eat an apple.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: the head is at (5,6). Moving RIGHT would take it to (5,7), which is a wall (since row 5, column 7 is '#'). So that's a collision. So RIGHT is invalid, leads to game over. So RIGHT is not possible.\n\nSo options are UP, LEFT, or maybe DOWN (but DOWN is reverse of UP, which is not allowed). So the snake can't go DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT.\n\nMoving UP: head moves to (4,6) which is 'A' → eat apple, score increases. That's good. The next position is safe (no wall, no body). So that's a valid and beneficial move.\n\nMoving LEFT: head moves to (5,5), which is empty. No apple. So that's safe but not helpful.\n\nSo the best choice is UP, because it allows the snake to eat an apple, which is better for the score.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# ASSS #\n# SSSS #\n#AS S  #\n# S   A#\n# SSS H#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 5, column 6) with a current direction of UP. The snake cannot reverse direction, so DOWN is invalid. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 4, column 6), which contains an apple ('A'). This is within the board (no wall collision) and not part of the snake's body (no 'S' here). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake, which is beneficial.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 5, column 5), an empty space. This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 5, column 7), which is a wall ('#'), causing a collision and ending the game.  \n\nThe optimal choice is UP, as it allows the snake to eat an apple and avoid collision. \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n# ASSS #\n# SSSS #\n#AS S  #\n# S   H#\n#ASSS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the epoch is 62. The snake can't reverse direction, so since it's moving UP, the next direction can't be DOWN. The possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is the reverse). \n\nFirst, let's map out the snake's body and head. The head is 'H' in the 5th row (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top). Let's check each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # ASSS # → positions 1-6: 1 is '#', 2 is 'A', 3 is 'S', 4 is 'S', 5 is 'S', 6 is ' ' (assuming 0-based columns)\nRow 2: # SSSS # → columns 1-6: 1 is '#', 2-5 are 'S's, 6 is ' '\nRow 3: #AS S  # → columns 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' '\nRow 4: # S   H# → columns 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'H', 6: '#'\nRow 5: #ASSS S# → columns 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: 'S', 7: '#'\nRow 6: #   SSS# → columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'\nRow 7: ########\n\nThe head 'H' is at row 4, column 5 (since row 4 is \"# S   H#\", so columns 0 is '#', 1 is 'S', 2-4 are spaces, 5 is 'H', 6 is '#'). So (row, column) = (4,5). \n\nCurrent direction is UP. So the next position if moving UP would be row 3, column 5. Let's check that position. Row 3 is \"#AS S  #\". Columns 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ' (assuming 0-based). So row 3, column 5 is a space (' '). So moving UP would take the head to (3,5), which is empty. But we need to check if that's a safe move. Also, we need to check if there's an apple in the possible directions to eat.\n\nLet's list possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since current direction is UP, can't go DOWN). Let's check each possible next position:\n\n1. UP (current direction): Next head position is (4-1,5) = (3,5). Let's check (3,5). Row 3 is \"#AS S  #\". Let's index columns from 0 to 7. So row 3, columns 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (3,5) is ' ' (empty). So moving UP would be to an empty cell. The snake's body would follow. Since the head moves to (3,5), the previous head (4,5) becomes part of the body. The rest of the body shifts. Need to check if the new head position is not colliding with the body. Are there any 'S's at (3,5)? No, that's a space. So safe.\n\n2. LEFT: Direction LEFT would mean moving to (4,5-1) = (4,4). Let's check (4,4). Row 4 is \"# S   H#\". Columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'H', 6: '#'. So (4,4) is ' ' (empty). So moving LEFT to (4,4) is possible. Check collision: (4,4) is empty, so safe.\n\n3. RIGHT: Direction RIGHT would move to (4,5+1) = (4,6). But row 4, column 6 is '#', which is a wall. So moving RIGHT would hit the wall and end the game. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, LEFT. Now, let's check if there are apples in the possible next positions. The apples are 'A's on the board. Let's find all 'A's:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: # ASSS # → column 2 is 'A' (row 1, column 2)\nRow 3: #AS S  # → column 1 is 'A' (row 3, column 1)\nRow 5: #ASSS S# → column 1 is 'A' (row 5, column 1)\n\nSo apples are at (1,2), (3,1), (5,1). The current head is at (4,5). The next positions for possible directions:\n\n- UP: (3,5) → no apple there.\n- LEFT: (4,4) → no apple there (row 4 has 'S' at column 1, others are spaces).\nSo none of the immediate next moves will eat an apple. So we need to choose a direction that avoids collision and allows the snake to move towards apples.\n\nLet's think about the snake's body positions. The snake's body is made of 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1: # ASSS # → columns 3,4,5 (since row 1 is # A S S S #, so columns 3,4,5 are 'S's). So (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\nRow 2: # SSSS # → columns 2,3,4,5 (since row 2 is # S S S S #). So (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3: #AS S  # → column 2 and 4 (row 3: # A S  S  → columns 2 and 4). So (3,2), (3,4)\nRow 4: # S   H# → column 1 (row 4: # S ... H). So (4,1)\nRow 5: #ASSS S# → columns 2,3,4 and 6 (row 5: # A S S S  S # → columns 2,3,4,6). So (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6)\nRow 6: #   SSS# → columns 4,5,6 (row 6: #   S S S #). So (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSo the snake's body is in these positions. Now, when the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. The tail (last segment) will only move if the snake doesn't eat an apple. Since no apples are being eaten in the next move (as none of the next positions are 'A'), the tail will move, so the snake's length remains the same (since length increases only when eating an apple).\n\nLet's consider the possible moves:\n\nMoving UP: New head at (3,5). The previous head (4,5) becomes 'S'. The rest of the body shifts. The tail (the last 'S') would be removed. Let's check if (3,5) is adjacent to any body parts. The new head (3,5) is adjacent to (4,5) (previous head, now body), (3,4) (which is 'S' in row 3, column 4). So (3,5) is next to (3,4) which is 'S' (body). But collision occurs only if the head moves into a body part. (3,5) is empty, so no collision.\n\nMoving LEFT: New head at (4,4). Check if (4,4) is a body part. (4,4) is a space (row 4: # S   H# → columns 1 is 'S', 2-4 are spaces, 5 is 'H'). So (4,4) is safe. Now, after moving LEFT, the head is at (4,4). The previous head (4,5) becomes 'S'. The next body parts follow.\n\nNow, which direction is better? Let's think about the snake's path. The snake is currently moving UP. If we continue UP, next head is (3,5). Then, the next possible moves from there. Let's see: (3,5) is in row 3. From (3,5), possible directions (since the current direction would be UP again, unless we change direction). Let's check the surroundings of (3,5):\n\nRow 3: #AS S  #. (3,5) is space. Up from (3,5) is row 2, column 5: which is 'S' (row 2, column 5 is part of the SSSS). So if we move UP again from (3,5), the next position would be (2,5), which is 'S' (body). That's a collision. So moving UP now would lead to a possible collision in the next step. \n\nAlternatively, if we move LEFT now, the head is at (4,4). Then, the next direction options (since current direction would be LEFT). The next possible moves would be LEFT (can't reverse to RIGHT), UP, or DOWN. Let's check (4,4). From (4,4), moving LEFT would be (4,3), which is a space (row 4, column 3 is space). That's safe. Alternatively, moving UP from (4,4) would be (3,4), which is 'S' (row 3, column 4 is 'S'). So moving UP from (4,4) would hit a body part. So if we move LEFT now, next move could be LEFT again (to (4,3)), which is safe.\n\nAnother angle: Let's check if moving UP now would lead to the head being in a position where the next move is blocked. If the snake is at (3,5) (after moving UP), the current direction is UP. The next move would be to (2,5), which is 'S' (from row 2, column 5: part of SSSS). So that's a collision. So moving UP now would cause the snake to hit its own body in the next step (epoch 63). Therefore, moving UP is dangerous.\n\nWhat about moving LEFT? After moving LEFT to (4,4), the current direction is LEFT. The next move (epoch 63) could be LEFT again (to (4,3)), which is safe. Let's check (4,3): row 4 is \"# S   H#\", so column 3 is space. So (4,3) is safe. Then, from (4,3), direction LEFT again would go to (4,2), which is space (row 4, column 2 is space). That's safe. So moving LEFT allows the snake to move leftward without hitting walls or body.\n\nSo the better choice is to move LEFT to avoid the upcoming collision when moving UP.\n\n\n########\n# ASSS #\n# SSSS #\n#AS S  #\n# S   H#\n#ASSS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 4, column 5) (0-indexed rows\/columns).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is invalid due to reversal rule).\n- **Collision Checks**:\n  - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4, 6), which is a wall ('#') → game over.\n  - **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (3, 5). This cell is empty (' '), but the next move (if continuing UP) would go to (2, 5), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S') → collision in the next epoch.\n  - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (4, 4). This cell is empty (' '). From (4, 4), subsequent moves (e.g., LEFT again to (4, 3)) are safe, avoiding walls and body collisions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT avoids immediate and future collisions, making it the safest choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. Let's list out each row to get a clear picture:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # ASSS # (so positions (1,1) is ' ', (1,2) 'A', (1,3) 'S', (1,4) 'S', (1,5) 'S', (1,6) ' ')\nRow 2: # SSSS # (positions (2,1) 'S', (2,2) 'S', (2,3) 'S', (2,4) 'S', (2,5) ' ', (2,6) ' ')\nRow 3: #AS    # (positions (3,1) 'A', (3,2) 'S', (3,3) ' ', (3,4) ' ', (3,5) ' ', (3,6) ' ')\nRow 4: # S  HS# (positions (4,1) ' ', (4,2) 'S', (4,3) ' ', (4,4) ' ', (4,5) 'H', (4,6) 'S')\nRow 5: #ASSS S# (positions (5,1) 'A', (5,2) 'S', (5,3) 'S', (5,4) 'S', (5,5) ' ', (5,6) 'S')\nRow 6: #   SSS# (positions (6,1) ' ', (6,2) ' ', (6,3) ' ', (6,4) 'S', (6,5) 'S', (6,6) 'S')\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. The head is 'H'. Let's find the position of the head. Looking at row 4 (since row 4 has 'HS'), the head is at (4,5) (assuming rows are 0-7 and columns 0-7, with (row, column) indices). Wait, row 4 is \"# S  HS#\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'H', 6: 'S', 7: '#'. So the head 'H' is at (4,5). \n\nThe snake's body is 'S's. Let's track the snake's body. The snake moves in the current direction (LEFT), so the next position the head would move to is (4,4) (since moving left from (4,5) is column 5-1=4). Let's check what's at (4,4). In row 4, column 4 is ' ', so that's empty. But we need to check if moving left is possible, and also consider possible collisions.\n\nBut wait, the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is LEFT. The possible directions the player can input are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, but can't reverse. Wait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So if current direction is LEFT, the snake can't immediately turn RIGHT (since that's reverse). So possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. Because turning RIGHT would be reversing.\n\nSo the possible directions to choose are LEFT, UP, DOWN. Because RIGHT is reverse of LEFT, so it's invalid.\n\nNow, let's check where the head is and possible next positions.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,5). Current direction is LEFT, so next position if direction remains LEFT is (4,4). Let's check (4,4) in the current board: row 4, column 4 is ' ' (from \"# S  HS#\" which is columns 0-7: 0='#', 1=' ', 2='S', 3=' ', 4=' ', 5='H', 6='S', 7='#'). So (4,4) is empty. So moving left would be possible, and no collision with body or wall.\n\nWhat if we choose UP? Then the head would move from (4,5) to (3,5). Let's check (3,5). Row 3 is \"#AS    #\": columns 0='#', 1='A', 2='S', 3=' ', 4=' ', 5=' ', 6=' ', 7='#'. So (3,5) is ' ', which is empty. So moving up is possible.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: head moves from (4,5) to (5,5). Row 5 is \"#ASSS S#\": columns 0='#', 1='A', 2='S', 3='S', 4='S', 5=' ', 6='S', 7='#'. So (5,5) is ' ', which is empty. So moving down is possible.\n\nNow, we need to check if any of these directions would lead to eating an apple. Let's check the positions of apples. Apples are 'A's on the board. Let's list all 'A's:\n\nRow 1: (1,2) 'A' (since row 1 is \"# ASSS #\": columns 1 is ' ', 2 is 'A', 3-5 are 'S's, 6 is ' ')\nRow 3: (3,1) 'A' (row 3 is \"#AS    #\": column 1 is 'A', column 2 is 'S')\nRow 5: (5,1) 'A' (row 5 is \"#ASSS S#\": column 1 is 'A', column 2-4 'S's, 5 ' ', 6 'S')\n\nSo apples are at (1,2), (3,1), (5,1).\n\nIf the snake moves in direction LEFT to (4,4): is (4,4) an apple? No, (4,4) is ' '.\n\nIf direction UP to (3,5): (3,5) is ' ', not an apple.\n\nIf direction DOWN to (5,5): (5,5) is ' ', not an apple.\n\nSo none of the immediate next positions have apples. So we need to look further, perhaps, but the snake moves one square at a time, so the next step's apple is only if the head moves into an 'A' square.\n\nBut perhaps the next move's direction could lead the snake towards an apple. Let's think about the snake's body positions. The snake's body is all the 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) (row 1: \"# ASSS #\": columns 3-5 are 'S')\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) (row 2: \"# SSSS #\": columns 1-4 are 'S')\nRow 3: (3,2) (row 3: \"#AS    #\": column 2 is 'S')\nRow 4: (4,2), (4,6) (row 4: \"# S  HS#\": column 2 is 'S', column 6 is 'S')\nRow 5: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6) (row 5: \"#ASSS S#\": columns 2-4 are 'S', column 6 is 'S')\nRow 6: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) (row 6: \"#   SSS#\": columns 4-6 are 'S')\n\nSo the snake's body is quite extensive. The head is at (4,5). Let's think about possible paths.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, so if we continue LEFT, next head position is (4,4). Then, after that, the direction could change again. But the player has to choose the next direction now.\n\nWe need to avoid collisions. Let's check if moving in any direction would cause collision with the body.\n\nIf direction LEFT: (4,4) is ' ', no collision.\n\nIf direction UP: (3,5) is ' ', no collision. Let's check (3,5) in the body list: (3,5) is not in the S positions, so safe.\n\nIf direction DOWN: (5,5) is ' ', not in S positions, so safe.\n\nSo all three directions (LEFT, UP, DOWN) are possible. Now, which direction is better? The goal is to eat apples. Let's see where the apples are. The apples are at (1,2), (3,1), (5,1). Let's see the positions of the head (4,5). The apple at (5,1) is in row 5, column 1. The head is at (4,5). To reach (5,1), the snake would need to move down to row 5, then left multiple times.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN now, the head would be at (5,5). Then, from (5,5), possible directions (can't reverse from DOWN, so possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. But RIGHT would be reverse of LEFT (if current direction was LEFT, but after moving DOWN, the current direction becomes DOWN, so reversing would be UP). So after moving DOWN, next direction could be LEFT (since DOWN's reverse is UP). So moving left from (5,5) would take the head to (5,4), which is 'S' (since row 5, column 4 is 'S'). Oh, right! (5,4) is part of the body (row 5: \"#ASSS S#\" has S at columns 2,3,4). So (5,4) is S, so if the head moves to (5,4), that's a collision with the body. So if the snake moves DOWN to (5,5), and then next direction is LEFT, that would hit the body.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,5). From (3,5), possible directions (current direction would be UP, so reverse is DOWN, so possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, UP). Moving left from (3,5) would be (3,4), which is ' ', then (3,3), ' ', (3,2) which is 'S' (row 3, column 2 is S). So (3,2) is body, so that's a collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,4). From (4,4), possible directions (current direction LEFT, reverse is RIGHT). So directions can be UP, DOWN, LEFT. Moving left again to (4,3), which is ' ', then (4,2) which is 'S' (row 4, column 2 is S), collision. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. Let's check if there's a path to an apple without collision. Let's look at the apple at (3,1). The head is at (4,5). To reach (3,1), the snake would need to go up to row 3, then left. Let's see the path. (4,5) → (3,5) (UP) → (3,4) (LEFT) → (3,3) (LEFT) → (3,2) (LEFT) → (3,1) (LEFT). But (3,2) is 'S' (body), so that's a collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nApple at (5,1): (4,5) → (5,5) (DOWN) → (5,4) (LEFT, but (5,4) is S, collision) → can't go left. Alternatively, (5,5) → (5,6) (RIGHT), but (5,6) is S (row 5, column 6 is S). So (5,6) is body. So moving right from (5,5) would hit S. So (5,5) can't move right. So moving down to (5,5) is possible, but next steps are blocked.\n\nApple at (1,2): (4,5) → (3,5) (UP) → (2,5) (UP) → (2,5) is row 2, column 5. Row 2 is \"# SSSS #\": column 5 is ' ', so (2,5) is ' '. Then (2,5) → (1,5) (UP). Row 1, column 5 is 'S' (row 1: \"# ASSS #\", columns 3-5 are S). So (1,5) is S, collision. So that path is blocked.\n\nHmm. So all the apples are in positions that require the snake to move through its own body. Maybe the snake is in a tight spot. Let's check if any direction leads to a wall. The walls are the edges (row 0 and 7, column 0 and 7). The head is at (4,5). Moving LEFT would take it to (4,4), which is row 4 (not 0 or 7), column 4 (not 0 or 7). So no wall collision. UP to (3,5): row 3, column 5: safe. DOWN to (5,5): row 5, column 5: safe.\n\nSo all directions are safe for the next move. But which one is better? Since none of the next moves have apples, perhaps the best is to choose a direction that allows the snake to have more space, avoiding future collisions. Let's look at the possible next positions and their adjacent cells.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT to (4,4):\n\nNext head position: (4,4). The adjacent cells (for future moves) would be (4,3) (left), (3,4) (up), (5,4) (down). Let's check these:\n\n(4,3) is ' ' (row 4: \"# S  HS#\", column 3 is ' '). (3,4) is ' ' (row 3: \"#AS    #\", column 4 is ' '). (5,4) is 'S' (row 5, column 4 is 'S'). So (5,4) is body. So moving left to (4,4), next possible directions could be up, left, or down (but down would hit S).\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (3,5):\n\nNext head position: (3,5). Adjacent cells: (3,4) (left), (2,5) (up), (4,5) (down). (3,4) is ' ', (2,5) is ' ' (row 2: \"# SSSS #\", column 5 is ' '), (4,5) was the previous head position (now it's part of the body after moving, since the snake's body follows). Wait, when the snake moves, the body segments follow. So when the head moves, the body moves into the previous positions of the head. So after moving, the previous head position becomes part of the body, and the tail (last body segment) may or may not be removed, depending on whether an apple was eaten. Since no apple was eaten in this move, the snake's length remains the same, so the tail (the last 'S') would be removed. But tracking the exact body movement is complex, but perhaps in the current scenario, the next move's body positions would shift.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to choose a direction that doesn't lead into the body in the next steps. Since all directions are safe for the next move, perhaps the best is to continue in the current direction (LEFT), as changing direction might not help. Alternatively, maybe UP or DOWN.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if any direction leads to an apple in the next steps. For example, if the snake moves UP to (3,5), then next direction could be LEFT to (3,4), then LEFT to (3,3), then LEFT to (3,2) (which is S, collision). So that path is blocked. If moving LEFT to (4,4), then next direction LEFT to (4,3), then LEFT to (4,2) (which is S, collision). So that's blocked. If moving DOWN to (5,5), then next direction LEFT to (5,4) (S, collision). So all directions lead to collision in the next few steps. But since the game has 100 epochs and current epoch is 63, there are 37 epochs left. The snake needs to survive as long as possible. But perhaps the best choice is to pick a direction that doesn't immediately hit the body.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is to choose the direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) that is valid (not reversing) and safe (no collision). Since RIGHT is reversing (current direction is LEFT, so can't choose RIGHT), possible options are LEFT, UP, DOWN. All are safe. Which to choose? The example given in the problem shows that when the snake moves into an apple, it grows. But here, none of the next positions are apples. So perhaps any direction is acceptable, but perhaps the best is to continue in the current direction (LEFT), as changing direction may not be necessary. So the answer would be LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# ASSS #\n# SSSS #\n#AS    #\n# S  HS#\n#ASSS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4,5) (row 4, column 5), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so RIGHT is invalid. The possible directions to choose are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (4,5) leads to (4,4), which is an empty space (' ') with no collision (no wall or body). \n- **UP**: Moving up from (4,5) leads to (3,5), which is an empty space (' ') with no collision. \n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (4,5) leads to (5,5), which is an empty space (' ') with no collision. \n\nNone of these directions immediately lead to an apple, but all are safe. Since the snake is currently moving LEFT and there is no immediate need to change direction, continuing in the current direction (LEFT) is a reasonable choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by parsing the game board.\n\nThe board is 8x8, with walls as '#'. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # ASSS # → positions 1 to 6 (since walls are 0 and 7). So row 1, columns 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' '\nRow 2: # SS S # → columns 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' '\nRow 3: #AS    # → columns 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' '\nRow 4: # S HSS# → columns 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'H', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ' (since row 4 is \"# S HSS#\", the characters are: 0:'#',1:' ',2:'S',3:'H',4:'S',5:'S',6:' ',7:'#')\nRow 5: #ASSS S# → columns 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: 'S'\nRow 6: #   SSS# → columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S'\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake can't reverse direction, so if current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since LEFT is current, can continue moving LEFT, or turn UP\/DOWN, but not reverse to RIGHT).\n\nFirst, let's find the snake's head position. The head is 'H'. Looking at row 4, column 3 (since rows are 0-based, columns 0-based). So H is at (4,3).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, so if the snake continues moving LEFT, the next position of the head would be (4,2). Let's check what's at (4,2). Looking at row 4, column 2: 'S' (from \"# S HSS#\" → positions 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'H', etc.). So (4,2) is 'S' → that's the snake's own body. Moving LEFT would cause a collision with itself. So moving LEFT is invalid (game over).\n\nSo the snake can't go LEFT again. Next, possible directions are UP or DOWN (since RIGHT is reverse of LEFT, which is not allowed). Let's check each.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. Possible directions to turn are UP or DOWN. Let's check each possible direction's next head position.\n\nFirst, direction UP: the snake would move up. The head is at (4,3). Moving UP would take it to (3,3). Let's check (3,3) in the board. Row 3 is \"#AS    #\", columns 0-7. Column 3 of row 3 is ' ' (since row 3 is \"#AS    #\", columns 1 is 'A', 2 is 'S', 3 is ' ', 4 is ' ', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' '). So (3,3) is empty. That's safe.\n\nNext, check direction DOWN: moving down from (4,3) would take the head to (5,3). Let's check row 5, column 3. Row 5 is \"#ASSS S#\", columns 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: 'S'. So (5,3) is 'S' → snake's body. Moving DOWN would hit the body. So that's a collision. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nWhat about direction RIGHT? Wait, the current direction is LEFT. The rule says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is LEFT, the reverse is RIGHT, which is not allowed. So the snake can't choose RIGHT. So the only possible directions are UP (valid) or DOWN (invalid) or LEFT (invalid). So the only possible direction is UP.\n\nWait, let's confirm the positions again. Let's list the head's current position (row, column) as (4,3). \n\nIf direction is UP: next head position is (4-1,3) = (3,3). What's in (3,3)? Row 3 is \"#AS    #\". Let's index each character: row 3, columns 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (3,3) is ' ' → safe.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: (4+1,3) = (5,3). Row 5: \"#ASSS S#\" → columns 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: 'S', 7: '#'. So (5,3) is 'S' → body. Collision.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: (4,3-1) = (4,2). Row 4: \"# S HSS#\" → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'H', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. (4,2) is 'S' → body. Collision.\n\nDirection RIGHT is reverse, so invalid. So the only possible direction is UP. So the answer should be UP.\n\n\n########\n# ASSS #\n# SS S #\n#AS    #\n# S HSS#\n#ASSS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4, 3) (row 4, column 3). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction to RIGHT. \n\n- **Moving LEFT**: Next head position would be (4, 2), which is occupied by 'S' (snake's body), causing a collision. Invalid.  \n- **Moving DOWN**: Next head position would be (5, 3), which is occupied by 'S' (snake's body), causing a collision. Invalid.  \n- **Moving UP**: Next head position would be (3, 3), which is an empty space (' '), safe to move.  \n\nThe only valid direction is UP.  \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n# ASSS #\n# SS   #\n#AS H  #\n# S SSS#\n#ASSS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the epoch is 65, which is under 100, so the game isn't ending yet. \n\nFirst, let's identify the snake's head (H) and body (S). The head is in the row \"#AS H  #\". Let's index the rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7). So row 3 (since 0-based) has \"AS H  #\". Let's look at the columns. The row is \"#AS H  #\", so positions:\n\nColumn 0: # (wall)\nColumn 1: A\nColumn 2: S\nColumn 3: (space)\nColumn 4: H (head)\nColumn 5: (space)\nColumn 6: (space)\nColumn 7: # (wall)\n\nSo the head (H) is at (row 3, column 4). The current direction is UP, meaning the snake is moving upwards. The next position the head would move to if we keep direction UP is (row 2, column 4). Let's check that position.\n\nRow 2 is \"# SS   #\". Columns: 0 is #, 1 is (space), 2 is S, 3 is S, 4 is (space), 5 is (space), 6 is (space), 7 is #. So (row 2, column 4) is a space. So if we move UP, the head would go there. But wait, we need to check if that's a valid move (no collision with walls or own body). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 2, column 4: space. So no collision there. But we also need to check if there's an apple there. The current direction's next position (row 2, column 4) in row 2: the row is \"# SS   #\", which has no A in column 4. So moving UP would take the head to a safe spot, but no apple.\n\nNow, the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is UP, so the opposite direction is DOWN. So we can't choose DOWN. The possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is reverse). Let's check those.\n\nLet's list the possible directions:\n\n1. UP: next position (row 3-1, column 4) = (2,4). As above, that's a space. No apple. So the snake moves there, the body follows. The new head is (2,4), and the previous head (3,4) becomes S. The body segments shift.\n\n2. LEFT: direction is LEFT. The next position is (row 3, column 4-1) = (3,3). Let's check that cell. The row 3 is \"#AS H  #\", so column 3 is a space (since \"AS H\" is columns 1:A, 2:S, 3: space, 4:H). So (3,3) is space. No apple. Is that safe? No collision.\n\n3. RIGHT: direction is RIGHT. Next position is (row 3, column 4+1) = (3,5). Check row 3, column 5: it's a space. So (3,5) is safe.\n\nBut we need to look for apples. Let's check where the apples (A) are on the board. Let's list all A positions:\n\nRow 1: \"# ASSS #\" → columns 1, 2, 3, 4? Wait, let's parse each row properly.\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # ASSS # → columns 1 is A, 2 is S, 3 is S, 4 is S, 5 is space, 6 is space, 7 is #. So row 1, column 1: A.\nRow 2: # SS   # → columns 1: space, 2:S, 3:S, 4: space, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. No A here.\nRow 3: #AS H  # → columns 1:A, 2:S, 3: space, 4:H, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So row 3, column 1: A.\nRow 4: # S SSS# → columns 1: space, 2:S, 3: space, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S, 7: #. No A here.\nRow 5: #ASSS S# → columns 1:A, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 5: space, 6:S, 7: #. So row 5, column 1: A.\nRow 6: #   SSS# → columns 1: space, 2: space, 3: space, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S, 7: #. No A here.\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo apples are at (1,1), (3,1), (5,1).\n\nNow, the snake's head is at (3,4). Let's see which direction can lead to an apple. Let's check the possible next moves and their adjacent apples.\n\nCurrent direction is UP. Let's think about the snake's body. The snake's body is made of S's. Let's try to map the snake's body to see its length and positions. The head is at (3,4). The body segments (S) are in the surrounding areas. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: columns 2,3,4 (since \"# ASSS #\": column 1 is A, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S)\nRow 2: columns 2,3 (\"# SS   #\": columns 2:S, 3:S)\nRow 3: column 2 (\"#AS H  #\": column 2:S)\nRow 4: columns 2,4,5,6 (\"# S SSS#\": column 2:S, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S)\nRow 5: columns 2,3,4,6 (\"#ASSS S#\": column 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 6:S)\nRow 6: columns 4,5,6 (\"#   SSS#\": columns 4:S, 5:S, 6:S)\n\nSo the snake's body is in all these positions. The snake's head is (3,4). Let's see the direction of movement. The snake moves in the current direction (UP) each step, unless the player changes direction (but can't reverse). \n\nThe next possible positions:\n\nIf direction is UP: head moves to (2,4). Check if (2,4) is S: row 2 is \"# SS   #\", column 4 is space. So safe.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: head moves to (3,3). Check (3,3): space. Safe.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: head moves to (3,5). Check (3,5): space. Safe.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: reverse of UP. Not allowed.\n\nNow, let's check if any of these directions lead towards an apple. The apples are at (1,1), (3,1), (5,1). All in column 1. The head is at (3,4), so column 4. So to reach column 1, the snake would need to move left multiple times.\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT now, the head would be at (3,3). Then, next possible moves could continue left. Let's see if moving left is possible. The next position (3,3) is safe. Then, from (3,3), possible directions (current direction would be LEFT, so can't go RIGHT). So next moves could be UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,4) might allow the snake to move left towards (2,3), which is S (row 2, column 3 is S). Oh, row 2, column 3 is S (from \"# SS   #\": columns 2 and 3 are S). So (2,3) is S, which is part of the body. So if the snake is at (2,4) (after moving UP), and then tries to move left to (2,3), that's a collision with the body.\n\nHmm. Let's think about possible collisions. The snake's body is all the S's. So if the head moves into any S, it's a collision.\n\nLet's check possible moves again. Let's list all the possible next positions for each direction:\n\nUP: (2,4) → is this S? Row 2, column 4: the row is \"# SS   #\", which is columns 0: #, 1: space, 2:S, 3:S, 4: space, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So (2,4) is space. Safe.\n\nLEFT: (3,3) → row 3, column 3: row 3 is \"#AS H  #\", which is columns 0: #, 1:A, 2:S, 3: space, 4:H, 5: space, 6: space, 7: #. So (3,3) is space. Safe.\n\nRIGHT: (3,5) → row 3, column 5: space. Safe.\n\nNow, the snake's goal is to eat apples. Let's see which direction gets the head closer to an apple. The apples are in column 1, rows 1, 3, 5. The head is at (3,4). So the closest apple in row 3, column 1. To reach that, the head needs to move left (from column 4 to 3, then 2, then 1). Let's check (3,3) (LEFT move) is safe, then next move LEFT to (3,2). (3,2) is S (from row 3: \"#AS H  #\", column 2 is S). Oh! (3,2) is S. So if the snake moves LEFT to (3,3), then tries to move LEFT again, the next position would be (3,2), which is S → collision. That's bad.\n\nSo moving LEFT once is safe, but moving LEFT again would hit the body. What about moving UP first? Let's say we move UP to (2,4). Then, possible directions (current direction is UP, so can change to LEFT, RIGHT, or keep UP). If next direction is LEFT, head moves to (2,3). (2,3) is S (row 2, column 3 is S from \"# SS   #\"), which is a collision. So that's bad.\n\nWhat about moving RIGHT? The head moves to (3,5). Then, possible directions: RIGHT (can't reverse, so if direction is RIGHT, next can't be LEFT). Let's see where (3,5) is. Then, moving RIGHT again would go to (3,6), which is space (row 3, column 6 is space). Then, (3,6) is safe. But there's no apple in that direction. The apples are all in column 1, so moving right takes the head away from apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN (but that's reverse of current direction UP, which is not allowed). So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo the available directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check if any of these directions have an apple in the next step. The next positions (UP: (2,4), LEFT: (3,3), RIGHT: (3,5)) — none of these positions are A. So none of the immediate next moves will eat an apple.\n\nSo the next step's priority is to avoid collision and move towards apples. Let's check the snake's body structure to see possible paths.\n\nThe snake's body is quite extensive. Let's try to trace the snake's body to see its length and direction. The head is (3,4). The body segments (S) around it: \n\nLooking at the head's position (3,4), adjacent cells:\n\nUp: (2,4) → space (as before)\nDown: (4,4) → row 4 is \"# S SSS#\", column 4 is S. So (4,4) is S (body).\nLeft: (3,3) → space\nRight: (3,5) → space\nSo the head's previous position (since the snake was moving UP) would be (4,4), because when moving UP, the head moves from (4,4) to (3,4). Because the current direction is UP, the previous position (the part that was the head before moving to (3,4)) would be (4,4). Let's confirm: the snake's movement: when moving, the head moves forward, and each body segment follows the previous one. So if the current head is (3,4) and direction is UP, the previous head position was (4,4), which is now part of the body (S). That's correct, because row 4, column 4 is S. So the body is (4,4), then (5,4) (since row 5 is \"#ASSS S#\", column 4 is S), and so on. So the snake's body is a chain going down from (3,4) to (4,4), (5,4), etc.\n\nSo the snake is moving UP, which is away from its body (since the body is below it in row 4,5,6). So moving UP is safe because the next position (2,4) is not part of the body.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,3): that's a space. Then, the next move's possible directions would be UP, LEFT, or DOWN (since current direction would be LEFT, so can't go RIGHT). Let's say after moving LEFT, direction is LEFT again. The next position would be (3,2), which is S (row 3, column 2 is S). That's a collision. So moving LEFT once is okay, but moving LEFT again is bad.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,5): that's a space. Then, next direction could be RIGHT again (moving to (3,6)), which is safe (row 3, column 6 is space). Then, (3,6) is safe, and next move could be RIGHT again to (3,7), which is a wall (column 7 is #). Oh, (3,7) is a wall. So moving RIGHT twice would hit a wall. So that's dangerous.\n\nSo moving UP seems safer. Let's check the next position (2,4). Then, the next possible directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Let's see (2,4) is in row 2, which is \"# SS   #\". So (2,4) is space. If the snake moves UP again (direction UP), the next position would be (1,4). Let's check (1,4): row 1 is \"# ASSS #\", column 4 is S (since \"# ASSS #\" → columns 1:A, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S). So (1,4) is S → collision. Oh, that's bad. So moving UP again would hit the body.\n\nSo if current direction is UP, and we choose UP again, the next head position is (2,4). Then, if we choose UP again, the next position is (1,4), which is S (body). So that's a collision. So after moving UP once, the next move UP would be dangerous.\n\nSo perhaps moving LEFT is better. Let's think: moving LEFT to (3,3). Then, the snake's direction is LEFT (since we changed direction to LEFT). Then, next possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (can't go RIGHT). Let's see (3,3) is space. Next, if we move UP from (3,3), the new position is (2,3). (2,3) is S (row 2, column 3 is S from \"# SS   #\"), so collision. If we move DOWN from (3,3), new position (4,3). Row 4 is \"# S SSS#\", column 3 is space (since row 4: columns 0: #, 1: space, 2:S, 3: space, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S, 7: #). So (4,3) is space. So that's safe. Then, from (4,3), direction could be DOWN again, moving to (5,3). Row 5 is \"#ASSS S#\", column 3 is S (row 5, column 3: S). So (5,3) is S → collision. So moving DOWN from (4,3) is bad. Alternatively, from (4,3), move LEFT to (4,2). (4,2) is S (row 4, column 2 is S) → collision. So that's bad.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try to find a path that avoids collision and leads towards an apple. The apples are in column 1. The head is at (3,4). To get to column 1, the head needs to move left through columns 3, 2, 1. Let's check column 2 in row 3: (3,2) is S (from \"#AS H  #\": column 2 is S). So (3,2) is part of the body, so the head can't go there. So the path left from (3,4) to (3,3) (safe), then (3,2) (body, collision). So that's blocked. What about other rows?\n\nLooking at row 5, column 1 is A (apple). The head is at (3,4). To reach row 5, column 1, the snake would need to move down (but current direction is UP, so can't reverse to DOWN immediately). If the snake first moves UP to (2,4), then maybe turn down. Let's see: moving UP to (2,4) (safe). Then, direction could be DOWN (since current direction is UP, changing to DOWN is allowed? Wait, the rule says \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Oh, right. So you can't reverse direction. So if current direction is UP, you can't immediately turn to DOWN. Because that's a reverse. So allowed directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nSo after moving UP, the direction is still UP. So next move can't be DOWN. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,3). Then, direction is LEFT, so next directions can be UP, DOWN, LEFT (can't go RIGHT). If we then move DOWN (allowed, since direction is LEFT, and DOWN is not reverse of LEFT). So from (3,3), moving DOWN to (4,3) (space). Then, from (4,3), direction could be DOWN again (current direction is DOWN, so can't go UP). Let's check (4,3) → (5,3). Row 5, column 3 is S (row 5: \"#ASSS S#\" → columns 2:S, 3:S, 4:S). So (5,3) is S → collision. So that's bad.\n\nWhat about moving RIGHT? The head moves to (3,5). Then, direction is RIGHT. Next directions can be UP, DOWN, RIGHT (can't go LEFT). Moving RIGHT again to (3,6) (space). Then, moving RIGHT again to (3,7) → wall. So collision. So that's bad.\n\nSo all directions seem to have potential issues, but we need to choose the one that's safest and maybe leads towards an apple. Let's check again for apples. The apples are at (1,1), (3,1), (5,1). The head is at (3,4). The apple at (3,1) is in the same row. The path from (3,4) to (3,1) is left through columns 3, 2, 1. But column 2 in row 3 is S (body). So (3,2) is blocked. So the snake can't reach (3,1) via that row. \n\nWhat about the apple at (5,1)? To reach (5,1), the snake would need to move down. But current direction is UP, so can't reverse to DOWN. So the snake would have to change direction to LEFT or RIGHT first, then down. Let's say the snake moves LEFT to (3,3) (safe). Then, direction is LEFT. Then, move DOWN to (4,3) (safe). Then, direction is DOWN. Then, move LEFT to (4,2). (4,2) is S (row 4, column 2 is S) → collision. So that's bad. Alternatively, from (4,3), move DOWN to (5,3) (S → collision). So that's not good.\n\nThe apple at (1,1): row 1, column 1. To reach there, the snake would need to move up. Let's see. Current direction is UP. So moving UP to (2,4) (safe). Then, direction is UP. Next move UP to (1,4) (S → collision). So can't go up further. So (1,4) is S, so the head can't go there. So the snake can't reach (1,1) via that path.\n\nSo all apples are in column 1, but the snake's body is blocking the path in their respective rows. So maybe the best option is to move in a direction that avoids collision and allows the snake to continue moving without hitting itself or walls.\n\nLet's recheck the possible next positions:\n\nUP → (2,4): space. Safe. No collision.\n\nLEFT → (3,3): space. Safe.\n\nRIGHT → (3,5): space. Safe.\n\nWhich of these is the best? Let's check if any of these positions are adjacent to apples. For example, (3,3) is adjacent to (3,2) (S) and (3,4) (H). (2,4) is adjacent to (2,3) (S), (2,5) (space). (3,5) is adjacent to (3,4) (H), (3,6) (space).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snake's body is arranged such that moving UP is better. Let's imagine the snake's body after moving UP. The new head is (2,4). The previous head (3,4) becomes S. The rest of the body shifts. The body was (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), etc. So after moving UP, the body would be (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), etc. So (2,4) is safe, and the next move could be LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,3) would make the new head (3,3), and the previous head (3,4) becomes S. The body would then include (3,4), (4,4), etc. \n\nBut perhaps the best choice here is to move UP. Because moving UP is the current direction, and the next position is safe, and there's no immediate danger. Let's confirm that (2,4) is not a body part. As row 2, column 4 is space, yes. So moving UP is safe.\n\n\nThe game board is:\n########\n# ASSS #\n# SS   #\n#AS H  #\n# S SSS#\n#ASSS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the snake needs to choose a new direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN) without reversing. Since the snake cannot reverse direction, DOWN is invalid. \n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n- **UP**: The head moves to (row 2, column 4). Checking the board, row 2, column 4 is a space (no wall or body collision). Safe.\n- **LEFT**: The head moves to (row 3, column 3). Row 3, column 3 is a space (no collision). Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: The head moves to (row 3, column 5). Row 3, column 5 is a space (no collision). Safe.\n- **DOWN**: Reverse of current direction (UP), so invalid.\n\n### Prioritizing safety and apple proximity:\nAll three directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe. However, the apples are located at (1,1), (3,1), and (5,1) (column 1 in rows 1, 3, 5). The snake’s head is at (3,4), so moving toward column 1 (LEFT) would bring it closer to apples. However, moving LEFT to (3,3) is safe, but further LEFT from (3,3) would hit the snake’s body (row 3, column 2 is S). Moving UP to (2,4) avoids immediate body contact and keeps the snake in a safer path. \n\nGiven the current board layout and the need to avoid future collisions, moving UP is the safest choice as it does not immediately block the snake’s path.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body segments are 'S', and apples are 'A'. The current direction is UP, and the epoch is 66, which is under 100, so the game is still ongoing.\n\nFirst, let's map out the positions of the head, body, apples, and walls. Let's list each row (rows are from top to bottom, 0 to 7, and columns 0 to 7 left to right):\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # ASS  # → So columns 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 2: # SSH  # → Columns 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'H', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 3: #AS S  # → Columns 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 4: # S SSS# → Columns 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'\nRow 5: #ASSS S# → Columns 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: 'S', 7: '#'\nRow 6: #   SSS# → Columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nNow, the snake's head is at row 2, column 3 (since row 2 is \"# SSH  #\", so positions 1: S, 2:S, 3:H, so H is (2,3)). The current direction is UP. The snake moves one square in the current direction each step, unless the player changes direction (but can't reverse). So if direction is UP, the next position of the head would be (1,3) (since moving up from row 2 to row 1, same column 3). Let's check what's at (1,3). Looking at row 1: \"# ASS  #\", column 3 is 'S' (since row 1's columns 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: 'S', 4: 'S'). So (1,3) is a body segment. If the snake moves UP, the head would collide with its own body, which ends the game. So moving UP is bad.\n\nThe player can choose a new direction, but can't reverse. The current direction is UP, so the opposite direction is DOWN. So the player can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP (but that's bad). Let's check possible directions:\n\nPossible directions (can't reverse, so can't go DOWN if current is UP? Wait, the problem says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So reversing is not allowed. So from UP, the snake can turn to LEFT or RIGHT, but not DOWN. Because DOWN is the reverse of UP.\n\nSo possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, or keep moving UP (but moving UP leads to collision). Let's check each possible direction.\n\nFirst, current head position is (2,3). Let's list possible next positions based on direction:\n\n- UP: (1,3) → which is 'S' (body) → collision → game over.\n- DOWN: (3,3) → check row 3: \"#AS S  #\", column 3 is ' ' (since row 3's columns 1: A, 2:S, 3: ' ', 4:S). So (3,3) is empty. But can we choose DOWN? Since current direction is UP, turning to DOWN is a reverse. So the player cannot choose DOWN. Because the rule says \"cannot reverse direction (i.e., UP to DOWN is reverse)\". So DOWN is invalid.\n- LEFT: direction is LEFT → head moves to (2,2). Let's check (2,2). Row 2 is \"# SSH  #\", so column 2 is 'S' (since row 2's columns 1:S, 2:S, 3:H). So (2,2) is a body segment. So moving LEFT would collide with body → game over.\n- RIGHT: direction is RIGHT → head moves to (2,4). Check (2,4): row 2 is \"# SSH  #\", column 4 is ' ' (since columns 1:S, 2:S, 3:H, 4: ' '). So (2,4) is empty. So moving RIGHT would be safe.\n\nWait, let's confirm positions again. Let's index rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7), columns left (0) to right (7).\n\nRow 2: \"# SSH  #\" → indexes 0 is '#', 1 is 'S', 2 is 'S', 3 is 'H', 4 is ' ', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So head is at (row 2, column 3).\n\nIf direction is RIGHT, the next head position is (row 2, column 4). What's in (row 2, column 4)? It's ' ' (empty). So that's safe. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,4).\n\nWhat's the next position for each direction:\n\nUP: (row 1, column 3). Let's check row 1: \"# ASS  #\". Columns 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is 'A', 3 is 'S', 4 is 'S', 5 is ' ', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So (1,3) is 'S' (body). Collision. So invalid.\n\nLEFT: (row 2, column 2). Which is 'S' (body). Collision. Invalid.\n\nRIGHT: (row 2, column 4). ' ', safe. So that's a valid move.\n\nDOWN: (row 3, column 3). Let's check row 3: \"#AS S  #\". Columns 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (3,3) is ' ' (empty). But can we turn to DOWN? The current direction is UP. The problem states that the snake cannot reverse direction (UP to DOWN is reverse). So the player cannot choose DOWN as the direction. So the allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP (but UP is bad). So the only possible safe direction is RIGHT.\n\nSo the best direction to choose is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# ASS  #\n# SSH  #\n#AS S  #\n# S SSS#\n#ASSS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (row 2, column 3) with the current direction UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., UP to DOWN), so valid directions to consider are LEFT, RIGHT, or continuing UP. \n\n- **UP**: Next head position is (row 1, column 3), which contains a body segment ('S'). Collision would end the game.  \n- **LEFT**: Next head position is (row 2, column 2), which contains a body segment ('S'). Collision would end the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: Next head position is (row 2, column 4), which is empty (' '). This is safe and avoids collision.  \n\nThus, the only safe direction is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out what direction the snake should move next. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's state.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls as '#'. Let's parse the board row by row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # AS   # (so positions (1,1) is ' ', (1,2) 'A', (1,3) 'S', (1,4) ' ', (1,5) ' ', (1,6) '#')\nRow 2: # SSSH # (positions (2,1) 'S', (2,2) 'S', (2,3) 'S', (2,4) 'H', (2,5) ' ', (2,6) '#')\nRow 3: #AS S  # (positions (3,1) 'A', (3,2) 'S', (3,3) ' ', (3,4) 'S', (3,5) ' ', (3,6) '#')\nRow 4: # S SSS# (positions (4,1) ' ', (4,2) 'S', (4,3) ' ', (4,4) 'S', (4,5) 'S', (4,6) 'S', (4,7) '#')\nRow 5: #ASSS S# (positions (5,1) 'A', (5,2) 'S', (5,3) 'S', (5,4) 'S', (5,5) ' ', (5,6) 'S', (5,7) '#')\nRow 6: #   SSS# (positions (6,1) ' ', (6,2) ' ', (6,3) ' ', (6,4) 'S', (6,5) 'S', (6,6) 'S', (6,7) '#')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe snake's head is 'H'. Looking at row 2, position (2,4) is 'H'. So the head is at (row, column) (2,4). The current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is moving to the right (column increases by 1 each step).\n\nThe snake's body is made of 'S's. We need to track the body to avoid collision. Also, the snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is RIGHT, the snake can't immediately go LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (but need to check if that's safe).\n\nLet's first check where the head will move if we choose each possible direction.\n\nCurrent head position: (2,4). Let's note coordinates as (row, column), where rows are 0 (top) to 7 (bottom), columns 0 (left) to 7 (right). Wait, the board is presented with each row as a string, so for row 2, the characters are from index 0 to 7. So for row 2: \"# SSSH #\", which is index 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'H', 6: ' ', 7: '#'? Wait, no. Let me re-express each row properly. Let's index rows from 0 (top) to 7 (bottom), columns 0 (left) to 7 (right). Each row has 8 characters.\n\nRow 0: ######## (columns 0-7 are all '#')\nRow 1: # AS   # → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\nRow 2: # SSSH # → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'H', 6: ' ', 7: '#' → Oh! So H is at (2,5) (row 2, column 5). Because row 2 is \"# SSSH #\", which is 8 characters. Let's split it: index 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is 'S', 3 is 'S', 4 is 'S', 5 is 'H', 6 is ' ', 7 is '#'. So H is at (2,5).\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So moving RIGHT from (2,5) would take the head to (2,6). Let's check that position. In row 2, column 6 is ' ' (from the row \"# SSSH #\", column 6 is ' '). So moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,6), which is empty. Is that safe? Let's check if (2,6) is a wall or body. It's a ' ', so no collision. So possible.\n\nIf we choose UP: the head would move to (1,5). Let's check row 1, column 5. Row 1 is \"# AS   #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'A', 3: 'S', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (1,5) is ' ', which is safe. But we need to check if moving UP is allowed (current direction is RIGHT; can't reverse, so UP is allowed, since reverse of RIGHT is LEFT. So UP is allowed.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: the head would move to (3,5). Let's check row 3, column 5. Row 3 is \"#AS S  #\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: '#'. So (3,5) is ' ', safe.\n\nIf we choose LEFT: current direction is RIGHT. Reverse direction is LEFT, which is not allowed. So can't choose LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, we need to check for apples. The goal is to eat apples. Let's look for 'A's on the board.\n\nRow 1: column 2 → (1,2) is 'A'.\nRow 3: column 1 → (3,1) is 'A'.\nRow 5: column 1 → (5,1) is 'A'.\n\nSo apples at (1,2), (3,1), (5,1).\n\nCurrent head position (2,5). Let's see which direction gets the head closer to an apple.\n\nIf moving RIGHT to (2,6): next position is (2,6). What's around there? Let's see. Then, the next move (epoch 68) would have direction (could be changed again, but we need to think for this step). But the immediate next position is (2,6), which is empty. No apple here.\n\nIf moving UP to (1,5). Then (1,5) is ' ', no apple. The next possible steps: from (1,5), directions could be UP (row 0 is wall, so can't), LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\nIf moving DOWN to (3,5). (3,5) is ' ', no apple. Then, possible next moves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to check the path to apples. Let's see the snake's body positions. The body is 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1, column 3 → (1,3): 'S'.\nRow 2, columns 2,3,4 → (2,2), (2,3), (2,4): 'S's.\nRow 3, column 2 and 4 → (3,2), (3,4): 'S's.\nRow 4, column 2,4,5,6 → (4,2), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6): 'S's.\nRow 5, columns 2,3,4,6 → (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6): 'S's.\nRow 6, columns 4,5,6 → (6,4), (6,5), (6,6): 'S's.\n\nSo the snake's body is quite extensive. The head is at (2,5), moving RIGHT. Let's check possible directions for next move.\n\nFirst, check if moving RIGHT is possible. Next position (2,6). Is that a wall? No. Is that a body part? Let's check (2,6) in the body list. The body positions are as above; (2,6) is not in the list. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nMoving UP: (1,5). Check if (1,5) is a body part. (1,5) is ' ', so no. Safe.\n\nMoving DOWN: (3,5). (3,5) is ' ', no body. Safe.\n\nSo all three directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are possible. Now, which direction leads towards an apple?\n\nThe apples are at (1,2), (3,1), (5,1). Let's see the head's position (2,5). The apples are to the left (lower column numbers). So moving LEFT would be towards apples, but LEFT is the reverse direction (current direction is RIGHT), which is not allowed. So the snake can't go LEFT. So the alternative is to turn UP or DOWN, then maybe go LEFT in the next steps (if possible).\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (1,5), then next possible directions could be LEFT (since current direction would be UP, so can't go DOWN). If direction becomes LEFT, then from (1,5) moving LEFT to (1,4), then (1,3) (which is a body part, since (1,3) is 'S' in row 1, column 3). Oh, (1,3) is part of the body. So moving LEFT from (1,5) to (1,4) (which is ' ' in row 1, column 4), then (1,3) is 'S' (body). So that's a collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (1,5), then direction could be UP again (row 0 is wall, so can't), or RIGHT (to (1,6), which is ' '), but that's away from apples.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (3,5). Then, possible directions next step could be LEFT (since current direction would be DOWN, can't go UP). From (3,5), moving LEFT to (3,4). (3,4) is 'S' (row 3, column 4 is 'S'), which is body. So collision. So that's bad.\n\nIf the snake continues RIGHT to (2,6). Then next direction could be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again. Let's see (2,6) is ' ', then moving RIGHT again would take to (2,7), which is a wall (row 2, column 7 is '#'). So that's a collision. So can't move RIGHT again. So next step from (2,6), possible directions are UP (to (1,6)), DOWN (to (3,6)), or LEFT (reverse of RIGHT, which is allowed if direction was changed). Wait, the current direction after moving RIGHT would be RIGHT. So from (2,6), the next direction can't be LEFT (reverse). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. But RIGHT is wall (column 7), so only UP or DOWN.\n\nMoving UP from (2,6) to (1,6): (1,6) is ' ' (row 1, column 6 is ' '). Then, possible directions (UP is current direction now?), no. The direction would have been RIGHT, then after moving to (2,6), the direction is still RIGHT. So next direction can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (but RIGHT is wall). So from (2,6), moving UP to (1,6), direction would be UP (since we changed direction to UP). Then from (1,6), possible directions are UP (row 0 is wall), LEFT (allowed, since previous direction is UP, reverse is DOWN), or RIGHT (wall). So moving LEFT from (1,6) to (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3) (body), etc.\n\nHmm. Maybe the snake is in a position where all directions are possible but none immediately lead to an apple. So the priority is to avoid collision and survive. Let's check if any direction leads to a body collision.\n\nWait, when the snake moves, the tail may move. Because when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (last segment) is removed. If it eats an apple, the tail stays, so the snake grows.\n\nIn the current state, the snake's length is the number of 'S's plus 1 (the head). Let's count the 'S's:\n\nRow 1: 1 S (column 3)\nRow 2: 3 S's (columns 2,3,4)\nRow 3: 2 S's (columns 2,4)\nRow 4: 4 S's (columns 2,4,5,6)\nRow 5: 4 S's (columns 2,3,4,6)\nRow 6: 3 S's (columns 4,5,6)\nTotal S's: 1+3+2+4+4+3=17. So the snake's length is 17+1=18. So the snake has 18 segments. When moving, if it doesn't eat an apple, the tail (the last segment) is removed. So the body shifts.\n\nBut perhaps for the current move, the key is to check where the next head position is. Let's recheck the head's next positions.\n\nCurrent head at (2,5), direction RIGHT. Possible next positions:\n\n- RIGHT: (2,6). What's (2,6)? From row 2: \"# SSSH #\", column 6 is ' ', so that's safe. So the new head is (2,6). Then, the body segments shift. The previous head (2,5) becomes 'S', and the tail (the last 'S') is removed. But without knowing the exact order of the body (since the snake's body is a sequence), it's hard to track. But the problem states that the snake can't collide with itself, which means the new head position can't be any of the current body positions (except possibly if the tail is moving, but in the same step, the tail is only removed after the head moves. So if the head moves to a position that is the tail's current position, and the tail is removed, then it's safe. Because the tail is no longer there.)\n\nSo when the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and if that position is not a wall or a body (except the tail, which will be removed), then it's safe.\n\nIn the current scenario, the next head positions:\n\nRIGHT → (2,6). Check if (2,6) is a body part. Current body positions are all 'S's. (2,6) is not in the 'S' positions listed earlier (row 2, column 6 is ' '), so safe.\n\nUP → (1,5). (1,5) is ' ', not a body part. Safe.\n\nDOWN → (3,5). (3,5) is ' ', not a body part. Safe.\n\nSo all three directions are safe. Now, which direction should be chosen to maximize the chance of eating an apple.\n\nLooking at the apples' positions: (1,2), (3,1), (5,1). All are on the left side (columns 1 or 2). The snake is on the right side (column 5, 6). So the snake needs to turn left (but can't reverse) and navigate towards the left.\n\nIf the snake continues moving RIGHT to (2,6), next step can't go RIGHT (wall), so must go UP or DOWN. If it goes UP to (1,6), then can go LEFT towards (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) (body). Oh, (1,3) is a body part, so that's a collision. So that path is dangerous.\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (1,5), then next direction could be LEFT (since current direction is UP, can't go DOWN). Moving LEFT from (1,5) to (1,4) (safe), then (1,3) (body). So that's a collision.\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to (3,5), then next direction could be LEFT (current direction is DOWN, can't go UP). Moving LEFT to (3,4), which is 'S' (body part) → collision. So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT is the best option, as the other directions may lead into body parts when trying to turn left. Let's check if moving RIGHT is safe. (2,6) is safe. Then, next step (epoch 68), direction could be UP or DOWN. Let's say after moving RIGHT to (2,6), the direction is now RIGHT (since the player could choose to continue, but the player can change direction as long as it's not reverse). Wait, the player controls the direction input each step. So after moving RIGHT, the next direction input can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since can't go LEFT). So if the player then chooses UP, the head moves to (1,6). Then, (1,6) is ' ', safe. Then, next direction could be LEFT (since current direction is UP, so reverse is DOWN, so allowed to go LEFT). Moving LEFT to (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3) (body). So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an apple that the snake can reach. Let's check if any of the next positions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) have an apple. None of them do. The apples are at (1,2), (3,1), (5,1). So none are adjacent to the current head.\n\nSo the best option is to choose a direction that doesn't lead to immediate collision and allows the snake to navigate towards apples. Since all directions are safe, perhaps the snake should continue moving in the current direction (RIGHT) unless it's unsafe. Since moving RIGHT is safe, that's a possible choice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN. Let's see: moving DOWN to (3,5). Then, the next positions. Let's check (3,5) is safe. Then, from (3,5), possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (can't go LEFT). If direction is DOWN, moving to (4,5). (4,5) is 'S' (row 4, column 5 is 'S') → collision. Oh, row 4 is \"# S SSS#\". Let's parse row 4 again:\n\nRow 4: \"# S SSS#\" → columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'. So (4,5) is 'S' (body part). So moving DOWN from (3,5) to (4,5) would hit the body. So direction can't be DOWN from (3,5). So from (3,5), possible directions are UP (to (2,5) → which is the previous head position, now part of the body?), or RIGHT (to (3,6), which is ' ' in row 3: \"#AS S  #\" → column 6 is ' '). (3,6) is ' ', so safe. So moving RIGHT from (3,5) to (3,6) is possible.\n\nBut perhaps the safest direction is to continue moving RIGHT. So the answer would be RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# AS   #\n# SSSH #\n#AS S  #\n# S SSS#\n#ASSS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,5) (row 2, column 5) with a current direction of RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). We need to check possible directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) for safety and apple proximity.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (2,5) leads to (2,6). Row 2, column 6 is ' ', which is empty (no wall or body collision). Safe.\n2. **UP**: Moving UP from (2,5) leads to (1,5). Row 1, column 5 is ' ', which is empty. Safe.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (2,5) leads to (3,5). Row 3, column 5 is ' ', which is empty. Safe.\n\n### Apple Proximity:\nApples are at (1,2), (3,1), and (5,1) (all left of the snake's current position). Since reversing to LEFT is invalid, the snake must navigate toward apples by first moving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT, then adjusting direction. \n\n### Safety and Path Considerations:\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,6) avoids immediate body\/wall collisions and leaves options to adjust direction (UP\/DOWN) in subsequent steps to navigate toward apples. \n- Moving UP or DOWN could lead to body collisions when attempting to turn LEFT in future steps (e.g., UP to (1,5) → LEFT to (1,4) → (1,3) is body; DOWN to (3,5) → LEFT to (3,4) is body). \n\nThus, continuing RIGHT is the safest choice to avoid immediate collisions and maintain flexibility.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S', apples are 'A'. The current direction is RIGHT, and the epoch is 68 (so 32 epochs left before the game ends at 100).\n\nFirst, I'll map out the board row by row to see where everything is. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # A    # → positions (1,1) is A, others (1,2-6) are empty, walls at (1,0) and (1,7)\nRow 2: # SSSSH# → Let's index columns 0-7. So row 2, columns 1-5: (2,1)=S, (2,2)=S, (2,3)=S, (2,4)=S, (2,5)=H. Columns 0 and 6 are # (walls), column 7 is #. So head is at (2,5).\nRow 3: #AS S  # → (3,1)=A, (3,2)=S, (3,3)= (space?), (3,4)=S, (3,5)= (space), (3,6)= (space), (3,7)=#. So (3,1)=A, (3,2)=S, (3,4)=S.\nRow 4: # S SSS# → (4,1)=S, (4,2)= (space), (4,3)=S, (4,4)=S, (4,5)=S, (4,6)=# (since the row ends with #). So (4,1)=S, (4,3)=S, (4,4)=S, (4,5)=S.\nRow 5: #ASSS S# → (5,1)=A, (5,2)=S, (5,3)=S, (5,4)=S, (5,5)= (space), (5,6)=S, (5,7)=#. So (5,1)=A, (5,2)=S, (5,3)=S, (5,4)=S, (5,6)=S.\nRow 6: #   SSS# → (6,1)= (space), (6,2)= (space), (6,3)=S, (6,4)=S, (6,5)=S, (6,6)=#. So (6,3)=S, (6,4)=S, (6,5)=S.\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nNow, the snake's head is at (2,5) (row 2, column 5). The current direction is RIGHT. The snake can't reverse direction, so if current direction is RIGHT, the next direction can't be LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nWe need to check where the head would move next in each possible direction, and see if that's safe (no collision with walls or own body), and if it's an apple (so we can eat and grow).\n\nFirst, let's find the current head position: (row 2, column 5). Let's note rows are 0-7 (top to bottom), columns 0-7 (left to right). So moving RIGHT from (2,5) would take the head to (2,6). Let's check that position. Looking at row 2: \"# SSSSH#\" → columns 0 is #, 1-5 are SSSSH, column 6 is # (since the row ends with #). So (2,6) is a wall. So moving RIGHT would hit the wall. That's a collision. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nNext, possible directions: UP or DOWN (since can't go LEFT, which is reverse of RIGHT).\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. But RIGHT is invalid (wall). So options are UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check moving UP. The head is at (2,5). Moving UP would take it to (1,5). Let's check row 1: \"# A    #\". Columns in row 1: 0 is #, 1 is A, 2-5 are spaces, 6 is # (since the row is \"# A    #\", which is 8 characters: # A    # → columns 0: #, 1: A, 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #? Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in parsing the rows. Let's count each row's characters.\n\nEach row is 8 characters. Let's parse each row correctly:\n\nRow 0: \"########\" → 8 #, columns 0-7: all #.\nRow 1: \"# A    #\" → columns 0: #, 1: A, 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (1,5) is ' ' (empty). So moving UP to (1,5) is empty. Is that safe? Are there any body parts there? Let's check if (1,5) is S. The snake's body is S. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) → S's here.\nRow 3: (3,2), (3,4) → S's.\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) → S's.\nRow 5: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6) → S's.\nRow 6: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) → S's.\n\nSo (1,5) is (row 1, column 5) → ' ', no S here. So moving UP to (1,5) is safe. Is there an apple there? No. The apple in row 1 is at (1,1). So (1,5) is empty. So moving UP would be safe, but no apple.\n\nNext, check moving DOWN. The head is at (2,5). Moving DOWN would take it to (3,5). Let's check (3,5) in row 3: \"#AS S  #\". Let's parse row 3: columns 0: #, 1: A, 2: S, 3: ' ', 4: S, 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (3,5) is ' ' (empty). Is there a body part there? Let's check S positions. (3,5) is ' ', so no S. So (3,5) is safe. Are there apples? No. So moving DOWN to (3,5) is safe, no apple.\n\nWait, but wait, what about the snake's body? The snake's body is all the S's. So (3,5) is empty, so no collision. So both UP and DOWN are possible. But we need to check if there's any apple in the next positions, and also plan for future moves to get apples.\n\nLet's look for apples. Current apples are 'A's on the board. Let's list all A positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1) → A.\nRow 3: (3,1) → A.\nRow 5: (5,1) → A.\n\nSo three apples. The snake's head is at (2,5). Let's see the positions of the apples. (1,1) is top left, (3,1) is row 3, column 1, (5,1) is row 5, column 1. All apples are on the left side (column 1) of the board. The snake's head is on the right side (column 5). The snake is moving RIGHT, but that's a wall. So the snake is in a position where moving right is blocked. So it must turn up or down.\n\nThe snake's body is in various positions. Let's think about the snake's body structure. The head is at (2,5). The body in row 2 is (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1). So the snake's body is extending left from the head in row 2, then maybe continues down. Let's see the next part. Let's try to trace the snake's body.\n\nSnake head at (2,5). The body is S's. The immediate next part (since snake moves, the body follows) would be the position the head was in before. Let's think about the snake's movement. The snake moves in direction RIGHT, so each step, the head moves right, and the body follows. So the previous position of the head would be (2,4), which is S (since row 2 has SSSSH, so (2,4) is S). Then (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) are S's. Then where does the body go next? Let's check row 3. Row 3 has \"AS S  #\". So (3,2) is S, (3,4) is S. Maybe the snake's body goes down from (2,1) to (3,2), then (4,1), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). It's a bit complex, but perhaps the snake is coiled in the lower left area.\n\nThe key is to avoid collision. Let's check possible directions again.\n\nOption 1: UP. Head moves to (1,5). Next direction can be UP, RIGHT (but RIGHT is wall), or DOWN. Wait, after moving UP, the new direction would be UP (if we choose UP as the direction input). The next move would be in the direction we choose. The player provides the direction input, which the snake will move in. So if we choose UP, the snake's direction becomes UP, and next move would be UP again (unless we change direction again, but each move is one step in the direction provided).\n\nOption 2: DOWN. Head moves to (3,5). Direction becomes DOWN. Next move would be DOWN.\n\nNow, let's check if there's any possible collision in the next steps. Let's see the positions:\n\nIf we go UP to (1,5):\n\n- The new head is (1,5). The next position (if moving UP again) would be (0,5), which is a wall (row 0 is all #). So moving UP again would hit the wall. So after moving UP once, the next direction can't be UP (as that would hit the wall). So perhaps the snake would need to turn left or right, but can't reverse.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3,5):\n\n- The new head is (3,5). Next move DOWN would be (4,5). Let's check row 4: \"# S SSS#\". Column 5 in row 4 is S (since row 4 is \"# S SSS#\" → columns 1: S, 2: ' ', 3: S, 4: S, 5: S, 6: #). So (4,5) is S. So if we move DOWN to (3,5) and then next direction is DOWN, the head would move to (4,5), which is S (body), causing collision. So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, after moving DOWN to (3,5), the next direction could be LEFT. Because the current direction after moving DOWN would be DOWN. The next direction can't be UP (reverse). So possible directions would be DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But RIGHT is (3,6), which in row 3 is ' ' (since row 3 is \"#AS S  #\", column 6 is ' '). So (3,6) is empty. But moving RIGHT from (3,5) would be (3,6), which is safe. But perhaps there's a better path.\n\nBut let's focus on the current move. The question is, which direction (UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT) should we choose now. Remember, the current direction is RIGHT, so can't go LEFT (reverse). So options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. But RIGHT is wall, so only UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check if moving UP or DOWN leads to an apple. The apples are at (1,1), (3,1), (5,1). The head is at (2,5). So the apples are far to the left. So the snake needs to navigate left to reach them.\n\nIf we move UP to (1,5), then the next possible direction could be LEFT (since after moving UP, the current direction would be UP, so next direction can't be DOWN (reverse). So possible directions would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT. But moving LEFT from (1,5) would take the head to (1,4), which is empty. Then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) which is an apple. So if the snake can move left from (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) (apple). That's a path to an apple.\n\nAlternatively, if we move DOWN to (3,5), then next direction could be LEFT. Moving LEFT from (3,5) would take the head to (3,4). Let's check (3,4): in row 3, \"#AS S  #\", column 4 is S (since row 3 has (3,4)=S). So (3,4) is S. So moving LEFT from (3,5) would hit the body. That's a collision. So that's bad. So moving DOWN to (3,5) and then trying to go LEFT would hit S at (3,4).\n\nSo, if we choose DOWN, the next move (if we try to go left) is blocked. Let's confirm (3,4) is S. Yes, row 3 is \"#AS S  #\", which is columns 0: #, 1:A, 2:S, 3: ' ', 4:S, 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: #. So (3,4) is S. So moving from (3,5) to (3,4) (LEFT) would hit the body.\n\nIf we choose UP, moving to (1,5). Then, next possible direction could be LEFT. Let's check (1,4) (moving left from (1,5)): (1,4) is ' ', no S. Then (1,3) is ' ', (1,2) is ' ', (1,1) is A. So that's a path to an apple. So moving UP now allows the snake to turn left and head towards the apple at (1,1).\n\nAnother thing to check: after moving UP, the new head is (1,5). The snake's body would grow if it eats an apple, but in this case, moving UP doesn't eat an apple (since (1,5) is empty). So the snake's length remains the same, and the body would follow. The body's previous positions would shift. The head was at (2,5), then moves to (1,5). The next body segment would be (2,5) (previously head), then the rest follow.\n\nNow, are there any other possible collisions if we move UP? Let's confirm (1,5) is empty. Yes, row 1 is \"# A    #\", which in column 5 is ' '.\n\nSo the options are UP or DOWN. UP seems better because moving DOWN may lead to collision when trying to go left (since (3,4) is S). So choosing UP allows the snake to move left towards the apple. Therefore, the best direction is UP.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A    #\n# SSSSH#\n#AS S  #\n# S SSS#\n#ASSS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,5) (row 2, column 5) with a current direction of RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible next directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (2,5) would take the head to (2,6), which is a wall (row 2 ends with '#'). This causes a collision, so RIGHT is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (2,5) would take the head to (3,5). Checking row 3 (\"#AS S  #\"), (3,5) is an empty space (safe). However, if the snake later tries to move LEFT from (3,5), it would hit (3,4), which is a body segment ('S'), leading to a collision.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP from (2,5) takes the head to (1,5). Row 1 (\"# A    #\") shows (1,5) is an empty space (safe). From (1,5), the snake can then move LEFT toward the apple at (1,1) (columns 4, 3, 2, and 1 are empty, avoiding body segments).  \n\nUP is the safest choice as it avoids immediate collision and allows a path toward an apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # A   H# (positions 1-6: 'A', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'H')\nRow 2: # S SSS# (positions 1-6: 'S', ' ', 'S', 'S', 'S')\nRow 3: #AS S  # (positions 1-6: 'A', 'S', ' ', 'S', ' ')\nRow 4: # S SSS# (positions 1-6: ' ', 'S', ' ', 'S', 'S', 'S')\nRow 5: #ASSS S# (positions 1-6: 'A', 'S', 'S', 'S', ' ', 'S')\nRow 6: #   SSS# (positions 1-6: ' ', ' ', ' ', 'S', 'S', 'S')\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the epoch is 69 (so 31 more moves before the game ends at 100). The snake's head is 'H' at row 1, column 5 (since row 1 is index 1, and the characters are positions 0-7; so row 1, column 5: because the row is \"# A   H#\", which is index 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'H', 6: '#', 7: '#'? Wait, let's check each row's columns properly.\n\nEach row is 8 characters. Let's index rows from 0 (top) to 7 (bottom), and columns 0 (left) to 7 (right).\n\nRow 0: columns 0-7 are all '#' (walls).\nRow 1: column 0 is '#', column 1 is 'A', columns 2-4 are ' ', column 5 is 'H', columns 6-7 are '#'. So H is at (1,5).\nRow 2: column 0 '#', column 1 'S', column 2 ' ', column 3 'S', column 4 'S', column 5 'S', column 6 '#', column 7 '#'.\nRow 3: column 0 '#', column 1 'A', column 2 'S', column 3 ' ', column 4 'S', column 5 ' ', column 6 '#', column 7 '#'.\nRow 4: column 0 '#', column 1 ' ', column 2 'S', column 3 ' ', column 4 'S', column 5 'S', column 6 'S', column 7 '#'.\nRow 5: column 0 '#', column 1 'A', column 2 'S', column 3 'S', column 4 'S', column 5 ' ', column 6 'S', column 7 '#'.\nRow 6: column 0 '#', column 1 ' ', column 2 ' ', column 3 ' ', column 4 'S', column 5 'S', column 6 'S', column 7 '#'.\nRow 7: all '#' (walls).\n\nThe snake's head is at (1,5). The current direction is UP. The snake is moving up. So the next position if it continues UP would be (0,5), which is a wall (since row 0 is all '#'). That's a collision, so the game would end. So moving UP is bad.\n\nWe need to choose a direction that's not the reverse of current direction. Current direction is UP. The reverse direction is DOWN, so we can't go DOWN (since you can't reverse direction). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. But UP leads to a wall, so UP is invalid. So options are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check possible directions:\n\nCurrent direction is UP. The snake can turn LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP (but UP is a wall). So possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nFirst, check LEFT direction. Moving LEFT from (1,5) would be (1,4). Let's see what's at (1,4). The row 1 is \"# A   H#\", which is columns 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: 'H'. So (1,4) is ' ', which is empty. Then, we need to check if that position is part of the snake's body. Let's look at the snake's body positions (all 'S's):\n\nLooking for 'S' in the board:\n\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3: (3,2), (3,4)\nRow 4: (4,2), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\nRow 5: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6)\nRow 6: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSo (1,4) is (row 1, column 4). Is that an 'S'? Let's check row 1: no, row 1 has 'A' at (1,1), 'H' at (1,5), others are ' '. So (1,4) is empty. So moving LEFT to (1,4) is safe.\n\nNext, check RIGHT direction. Moving RIGHT from (1,5) would be (1,6). Row 1, column 6 is '#', which is a wall. So moving RIGHT would hit the wall, game over. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo the only possible directions are LEFT. Because UP is wall, RIGHT is wall, DOWN is reverse direction (can't reverse). So the snake must turn LEFT.\n\nLet's confirm: current direction is UP. The snake can't reverse to DOWN. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. UP leads to (0,5) which is wall. RIGHT leads to (1,6) which is wall. LEFT leads to (1,4), which is empty (no body, no wall). So moving LEFT is the only safe option.\n\n\n########\n# A   H#\n# S SSS#\n#AS S  #\n# S SSS#\n#ASSS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head is at (1, 5). Moving UP would take the head to (0, 5), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'), causing a collision. Reversing direction to DOWN is not allowed. Moving RIGHT would take the head to (1, 6), which is a wall (column 6 of row 1 is '#'). The only valid direction is LEFT, which moves the head to (1, 4), an empty space (no wall or snake body). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls as '#' around the edges. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # A  HS# → Let's index the columns 0-7. So positions (1,1) is 'A', (1,4) is 'H' (head), (1,5) is 'S' (body part)\nRow 2: #   SSS# → (2,3) 'S', (2,4) 'S', (2,5) 'S'\nRow 3: #AS S  # → (3,1) 'A', (3,2) 'S', (3,4) 'S'\nRow 4: # S SSS# → (4,1) 'S', (4,3) 'S', (4,4) 'S', (4,5) 'S'\nRow 5: #ASSS S# → (5,1) 'A', (5,2) 'S', (5,3) 'S', (5,4) 'S', (5,6) 'S'\nRow 6: #   SSS# → (6,3) 'S', (6,4) 'S', (6,5) 'S'\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake is moving left. The head's position is (1,4) because in row 1, the 'H' is at column 4 (since the row is \"# A  HS#\", so columns 0 is '#', 1 is 'A', 2 is ' ', 3 is ' ', 4 is 'H', 5 is 'S', 6 is '#', 7 is '#'). Wait, let's check the columns again. Each row is 8 characters. Let's index each row's columns from 0 to 7.\n\nRow 1: index 0: '#', 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'H', 5: 'S', 6: '#', 7: '#' → So head is at (row 1, column 4).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So the next move would be to (row 1, column 3) if the direction remains LEFT. Let's check what's there. Row 1, column 3 is ' ' (space) according to row 1: \"# A  HS#\" → columns 0-7: 0=#, 1=A, 2= , 3= , 4=H, 5=S, 6=#, 7=#. So (1,3) is a space. But we need to check if moving left is possible, and also consider other directions.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is LEFT, so the opposite direction is RIGHT. So the snake can't turn RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.\n\nFirst, let's check the next positions for each possible direction.\n\nCurrent head position: (1,4). Let's note the body positions. The snake's body is all the 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1, column 5: S\nRow 2, columns 3,4,5: S, S, S → (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3, columns 2,4: S, S → (3,2), (3,4)\nRow 4, columns 1,3,4,5: S, S, S, S → (4,1), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\nRow 5, columns 2,3,4,6: S, S, S, S → (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6)\nRow 6, columns 3,4,5: S, S, S → (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo the body is all these positions.\n\nNow, possible directions:\n\n1. LEFT (current direction, allowed). Next head position: (1,4-1) = (1,3). Check if that's a wall or body. (1,3) is ' ' (empty), not a wall (walls are at column 0 and 6 in row 1). So safe. What's there? Just empty. No apple. So the snake would move there, and the tail would move (since the length would stay the same unless it eats an apple). But since there's no apple, the tail (last body part) would be removed. But since the problem is about choosing direction, we need to check if the move is safe.\n\n2. UP: Direction is UP. Next head position is (1-1,4) = (0,4). Row 0 is all '#' (top wall). So (0,4) is a wall. Collision with wall. Game over. So UP is invalid.\n\n3. DOWN: Direction is DOWN. Next head position is (1+1,4) = (2,4). Check (2,4): in row 2, which is \"#   SSS#\". Columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: '#', 7: '#'. So (2,4) is 'S' (body). So moving DOWN would cause the head to hit the body. Collision. Game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\n4. RIGHT: Opposite direction of current (LEFT), so not allowed. The snake can't reverse direction. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo the only possible direction is LEFT, which leads to (1,3), which is safe. Any other options? Let's confirm.\n\nWait, the current direction is LEFT, so possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (since RIGHT is reverse). But UP leads to wall, DOWN leads to body. So only LEFT is possible. So the answer must be LEFT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A  HS#\n#   SSS#\n#AS S  #\n# S SSS#\n#ASSS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (row 1, column 4).\n- Current direction: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so RIGHT is invalid.\n- Possible directions to consider: LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 0, column 4). Row 0 is a wall ('#'), so this causes a wall collision. **Invalid**.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 2, column 4). Row 2, column 4 is 'S' (snake's body), causing a self-collision. **Invalid**.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 1, column 3). This position is empty (' '), with no walls or body parts. **Safe and valid**.\n\nThe only valid direction is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake to move next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as required.\n\nThe game board given is:\n\n########\n# A HSS#\n#   SSS#\n#A  S  #\n# S SSS#\n#ASSS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, and the epoch is 71. The snake is moving left, and we need to choose a direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) that doesn't reverse the current direction (since reversing is not allowed). The current direction is LEFT, so the snake can't immediately go RIGHT. So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nFirst, let's locate the snake's head. The head is 'H'. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 1 (0-based index 1, since rows start from 0 maybe?), let's check each row. Let's index rows from top as 0 to 7 (since it's 8x8).\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # A HSS# → So positions (1,1) is ' ', (1,2) is 'A', (1,3) is ' ', (1,4) is 'H', (1,5) is 'S', (1,6) is 'S', (1,7) is '#'\nSo head is at (1,4) (row 1, column 4). Because in row 1 (second line), the characters are: index 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is 'A', 3 is ' ', 4 is 'H', 5 is 'S', 6 is 'S', 7 is '#'.\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, so the snake is moving left. The next position the head would move to if we choose LEFT is (1,3) (since moving left decreases the column index by 1). Let's check what's in (1,3). From row 1, column 3 is ' ' (space). So if the snake moves left, the head goes to (1,3). Now, we need to check if that's a wall or a body part. (1,3) is a space, so not a wall. Now, the body parts are 'S's. Let's check the rest of the board to see if (1,3) is part of the snake's body.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: ... (1,4)=H, (1,5)=S, (1,6)=S.\n\nRow 2: #   SSS# → positions (2,3)= ' ', (2,4)= 'S', (2,5)= 'S', (2,6)= 'S'\n\nRow 3: #A  S  # → (3,1)= 'A', (3,4)= 'S'\n\nRow 4: # S SSS# → (4,2)= 'S', (4,4)= 'S', (4,5)= 'S', (4,6)= 'S'\n\nRow 5: #ASSS S# → (5,1)= 'A', (5,2)= 'S', (5,3)= 'S', (5,4)= 'S', (5,6)= 'S'\n\nRow 6: #   SSS# → (6,3)= ' ', (6,4)= 'S', (6,5)= 'S', (6,6)= 'S'\n\nSo (1,3) is a space, not a body part. So moving LEFT is possible. But let's check other options.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN (since RIGHT is reverse).\n\nLet's check moving UP. The head is at (1,4). Moving UP would take it to (0,4). But row 0 is all '#', which is a wall. So moving UP would cause collision with the wall, game over. So UP is invalid.\n\nNext, moving DOWN. The head is at (1,4). Moving DOWN would take it to (2,4). Let's check (2,4). Row 2 is \"#   SSS#\". The columns are 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'. So (2,4) is 'S' (snake's body). So moving DOWN would cause the head to collide with the body, game over. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo the only possible direction is LEFT. Because UP is wall, DOWN is body, RIGHT is reverse. So moving LEFT is the only safe option.\n\nLet's confirm. If the snake moves LEFT, the head goes to (1,3), which is empty. Then, since the snake is moving, the body will follow. The previous positions of the snake's body are (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) — wait, maybe I need to track the snake's body properly, but the key point is that (1,3) is not part of the body. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nTherefore, the correct direction is LEFT.\n\n\n########\n# A HSS#\n#   SSS#\n#A  S  #\n# S SSS#\n#ASSS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 1, column 4) (0-based indexing).\n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so RIGHT is invalid.\n3. **Possible Directions**: LEFT, UP, DOWN (since RIGHT is reversed and invalid).\n4. **Collision Checks**:\n   - **UP**: Moving UP from (1,4) leads to (0,4), which is a wall ('#'). Collision with the wall would end the game. UP is invalid.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,4) leads to (2,4). Checking row 2 (\"#   SSS#\"), (2,4) is 'S' (snake's body). Collision with the body would end the game. DOWN is invalid.\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1,4) leads to (1,3). Checking row 1 (\"# A HSS#\"), (1,3) is a space (' '), not a wall or body part. This is safe.\n\nThe only valid direction that avoids collisions is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by parsing the game board.\n\nThe board is 8x8, with walls ('#') around. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # AHSSS# → Let's index columns 1 to 6 (since the first and last are walls). So positions (1,1) is ' ', (1,2) is 'A', (1,3) is 'H', (1,4) 'S', (1,5) 'S', (1,6) 'S'\nRow 2: #   SSS# → Columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S'\nRow 3: #A  S  # → Columns 1: 'A', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: ' '\nRow 4: #   SSS# → Columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S'\nRow 5: #ASSS S# → Columns 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: 'S', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: 'S'\nRow 6: #   SSS# → Columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S'\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe snake's head is 'H'. From row 1, column 3: (row, column) is (1,3) since rows are 0-7. Current direction is LEFT, so the snake is moving left. The next position if moving left would be (1,2). Let's check that position. (1,2) is 'A' (an apple). So if the snake moves LEFT, it will eat the apple. But wait, what's the rule about direction reversal? The current direction is LEFT. The possible directions the player can choose are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. But the snake cannot reverse direction. Reversing would be if current is LEFT, then RIGHT is reverse. So allowed directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN. Because RIGHT is the opposite of LEFT. So the player can't choose RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's check where the head is. The head is at (1,3). Current direction is LEFT, so moving left would take it to (1,2). Let's check if that's a valid move. The next position (1,2) is 'A', which is an apple. So eating that apple would make the snake grow. But we need to check if moving LEFT would cause a collision. The next position (1,2) is not a wall (since row 1, column 2 is inside the board), and is that part of the snake's body? The snake's body is 'S's. Let's list all 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1, columns 4,5,6 → (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\nRow 2, columns 4,5,6 → (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\nRow 3, column 4 → (3,4)\nRow 4, columns 4,5,6 → (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\nRow 5, columns 2,3,4,6 → (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6)\nRow 6, columns 4,5,6 → (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSo (1,2) is 'A', not a snake body. So moving LEFT is safe. That's good. If we move LEFT, we eat the apple, score increases by 1, and the snake grows. The new head would be at (1,2), and the body would follow. \n\nWhat about other directions? Let's see. Current direction is LEFT. Possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN (since RIGHT is reverse). Let's check UP. Moving UP from (1,3) would take the head to (0,3). But row 0 is a wall (all #), so that's a collision. So UP is invalid. \n\nMoving DOWN: current head is at (1,3). Moving DOWN would go to (2,3). Let's check (2,3). Looking at row 2: \"#   SSS#\" → column 3 is ' ' (since columns 1-6: 1 is ' ', 2 ' ', 3 ' ', 4 'S'). So (2,3) is empty. Is that part of the snake's body? The body positions listed earlier don't include (2,3). So (2,3) is safe. So moving DOWN is possible. But is there an apple there? Let's check (2,3): it's ' ', so no apple. So moving DOWN would just move the snake without eating, but it's safe. \n\nBut moving LEFT would eat the apple. Since the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, moving LEFT would be better. Let's confirm again: current direction is LEFT. The next position when moving LEFT is (1,2), which is 'A' (apple). So that's a valid move, no collision. So the best direction is LEFT.\n\n\n########\n# AHSSS#\n#   SSS#\n#A  S  #\n#   SSS#\n#ASSS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake's head is at position (1,3) (row 1, column 3). The snake cannot reverse direction, so the allowed directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (RIGHT is the reverse of LEFT and is invalid). \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (1,3) would take the head to (0,3), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). This would cause a collision, ending the game. Invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,3) would take the head to (2,3). Checking the board, (2,3) is empty (no wall or snake body). This is a safe move but does not eat an apple.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1,3) would take the head to (1,2), which contains an apple ('A'). This position is not a wall or snake body, so it is safe. Eating the apple increases the score and allows the snake to grow.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move LEFT to eat the apple.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let's list out each row to get a clear picture:\n\nRow 0: ######## (top wall)\nRow 1: # HSSSS# (so positions 1,1 is H, then 1,2-1,5 are S)\nRow 2: #   SSS# (positions 2,3-2,5 are S)\nRow 3: #A  S  # (position 3,1 is A, 3,4 is S)\nRow 4: # A SSS# (position 4,2 is A, 4,4-4,6 are S)\nRow 5: #ASSS S# (position 5,1 is A, 5,2-5,4 are S, 5,6 is S)\nRow 6: #   SSS# (positions 6,3-6,5 are S)\nRow 7: ######## (bottom wall)\n\nThe snake's head is at (1,1) since row 1 has 'H' at position 1 (assuming rows are 0-indexed and columns 0-7). The current direction is LEFT, which means the snake is moving left (towards lower column indices). The snake's body is the 'S's connected to the head.\n\nFirst, check the possible directions the snake can turn. The current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so it can't go RIGHT (since LEFT's opposite is RIGHT). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. But we need to check where the next position would be for each direction to avoid collision.\n\nLet's find the next positions for each possible direction:\n\nCurrent head position: (row, column) = (1,1) (since row 1 is the second line, and columns are 0-based. Let's confirm: the first character is '#', then the second is 'H' at column 1. So row 1, column 1.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So moving LEFT would take the head to (1, 0). But column 0 is a wall (since the first character of each row is '#'). So moving LEFT would hit the wall, which is a collision. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP or DOWN (since RIGHT is reverse and invalid, LEFT leads to wall).\n\nCheck UP direction: Moving UP from (1,1) would go to row 0, column 1. Row 0 is the top wall (all '#'), so (0,1) is a wall. So moving UP would hit the wall. That's invalid.\n\nCheck DOWN direction: Moving DOWN from (1,1) would go to row 2, column 1. Let's check row 2: \"#   SSS#\" so column 1 is a space (since row 2's characters are: index 0 '#', 1 ' ', 2 ' ', 3 'S', 4 'S', 5 'S', 6 '#'). So (2,1) is empty (not a wall, not a body part).\n\nNow, check if that position is part of the snake's body. The snake's body is all the 'S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: columns 2,3,4,5 (H is at 1,1; SSSS at 1,2-1,5)\nRow 2: columns 3,4,5 (SSS)\nRow 3: column 4 (S)\nRow 4: columns 4,5,6 (SSS)\nRow 5: columns 2,3,4 (SSS), column 6 (S)\nRow 6: columns 3,4,5 (SSS)\n\nSo (2,1) is (row 2, column 1) which is a space, not in any S positions. So moving DOWN is safe.\n\nNow, check if there's an apple in the next position. The next position when moving DOWN is (2,1). Let's check the apples. Apples are 'A's. Let's list all A positions:\n\nRow 3: column 1 (A)\nRow 4: column 2 (A)\nRow 5: column 1 (A)\n\n(2,1) is not an apple. So moving DOWN would just move the head there, and the body follows. The snake doesn't eat an apple here, but it's safe.\n\nAre there other possible directions? Let's confirm:\n\n- LEFT: (1,0) is wall → collision.\n- UP: (0,1) is wall → collision.\n- RIGHT: reverse direction of LEFT → not allowed (snake can't reverse).\nSo only possible direction is DOWN. Because any other direction leads to collision. So the answer must be DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# HSSSS#\n#   SSS#\n#A  S  #\n# A SSS#\n#ASSS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the snake's current state:\n- The snake's head is at (row 1, column 1).\n- Current direction is LEFT, so the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT.\n- Possible directions to consider: UP, DOWN, or continuing LEFT (but reversing is invalid, so only UP and DOWN are viable).\n\nChecking each direction:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1,1) would take the head to (1,0), which is a wall (row 1 starts with '#'). Collision occurs; invalid.\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (1,1) would take the head to (0,1), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). Collision occurs; invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,1) takes the head to (2,1). Checking row 2 (\"#   SSS#\"), column 1 is a space (not a wall or snake body). No collision; valid.\n\nThus, the only safe direction is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. The game board is 8x8 with walls around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body parts are 'S', apples are 'A', and walls are '#'. The current direction is DOWN, and we're at epoch 74, which is well before 100, so the game isn't ending yet.\n\nFirst, let's map out the current positions. Let's list each row to get the coordinates. Let's index rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7), and columns left (column 0) to right (column 7).\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# → columns 1-6: S S S S S (so columns 1-5 are S, column 6 is S? Let's check each position:\nRow 1: columns 1 is S, 2 S, 3 S, 4 S, 5 S, 6 S (since the row is # followed by SSSSS and then #, so positions 1-6 are S, but wait, 1 to 6 is 6 characters. Let's count: \"# SSSSS#\" → characters are 0: #, 1: S, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S, 7: #. So row 1 has S from (1,1) to (1,6).\n\nRow 2: # H SSS# → row 2: 0 is #, 1 is H, 2 is space, 3 S, 4 S, 5 S, 6: #. So (2,1) is H (head). The current direction is DOWN, so the head is moving down. The next position would be (3,1) if direction remains DOWN.\n\nRow 3: #A  S  # → (3,1) is A, (3,2) is space, (3,3) is S, (3,4) space, (3,5) space, (3,6) #. So (3,1) is an apple.\n\nRow 4: # A SSS# → (4,1) space, (4,2) A, (4,3) S, (4,4) S, (4,5) S, (4,6) #. So (4,2) is A.\n\nRow 5: #A SS S# → (5,1) A, (5,2) S, (5,3) S, (5,4) space, (5,5) S, (5,6) #. So (5,1) is A.\n\nRow 6: #   SSS# → (6,1) space, (6,2) space, (6,3) space, (6,4) S, (6,5) S, (6,6) S, (6,7) #. So (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are S.\n\nNow, the snake's head is at (2,1). Current direction is DOWN, so next move (without changing direction) would be to (3,1). Let's check what's at (3,1): it's an apple ('A'). So if we keep moving DOWN, the head moves to (3,1), eats the apple, grows, and the score increases. That's a good move.\n\nBut wait, we need to check if changing direction is possible. The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is DOWN. Reversing would be UP, which is not allowed. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since DOWN is current direction, which is allowed).\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, the example given is UP to DOWN (reverse), LEFT to RIGHT (reverse). So the reverse directions are opposite: UP ↔ DOWN, LEFT ↔ RIGHT. So current direction is DOWN. So the snake can't turn to UP (reverse). So possible directions are DOWN (current direction), LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. We need to check each for collision.\n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. DOWN: next position (3,1). What's there? (3,1) is A. So the head moves there. Since it's an apple, the snake eats it, grows. The new head is (3,1), and the body will extend. But since the snake was moving down, the previous head (2,1) becomes part of the body (S). So no collision here. The new position (3,1) is an apple, so that's safe. So this is a valid move.\n\n2. LEFT: direction LEFT. The next position would be (2,0). But (2,0) is a wall (since row 2 starts with # at column 0). So moving LEFT would hit the wall, causing collision. So that's invalid.\n\n3. RIGHT: direction RIGHT. The next position is (2,2). What's (2,2)? Let's check row 2: \"# H SSS#\". So row 2 is [ #, H,  , S, S, S, # ] → column 2 (third character) is a space (empty). So (2,2) is empty. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,2). But need to check if that's part of the snake's body. Let's check if (2,2) is S. From row 2: column 2 is space. So no, (2,2) is empty. So moving RIGHT is possible. But then, what's the next position? The current head is (2,1), moving RIGHT to (2,2). Then, the next step, the body would follow. But the current direction is DOWN, but if we change to RIGHT, the next direction could be any except LEFT (since current direction would be RIGHT, then can't reverse to LEFT). But in this move, we need to check if (2,2) is safe. (2,2) is empty, so moving RIGHT is safe. But then, we miss the apple at (3,1) which is directly below. So moving DOWN would get the apple, which is better.\n\nSo the best option is to move DOWN, eat the apple, which increases the score. So the answer should be DOWN.\n\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# H SSS#\n#A  S  #\n# A SSS#\n#A SS S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Current Position of the Head**: The snake's head 'H' is at (row 2, column 1) (rows indexed from top 0 to bottom 7, columns left 0 to right 7).  \n2. **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid), so possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.  \n3. **Collision Checks**:  \n   - **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (row 2, column 0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, so LEFT is invalid.  \n   - **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (row 2, column 2), which is empty (no snake body or wall). This is safe but does not target an apple.  \n   - **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (row 3, column 1), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score, and the snake grows without collision (since the target cell is not a wall or snake body).  \n\nThe best move is to continue moving DOWN to eat the apple and avoid collision.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid. Let's list out each row to visualize the positions:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# (so columns 1-5 are S, column 6 is #)\nRow 2: # S SSS# (columns 1: S, 2: space, 3-5: S)\nRow 3: #AH S  # (columns 1: A, 2: H, 3: S, 4: space, 5: space)\nRow 4: # A SSS# (columns 1: A, 2: space, 3: S, 4: S, 5: S)\nRow 5: #A  S S# (columns 1: A, 2: space, 3: space, 4: S, 5: S)\nRow 6: #   SSS# (columns 1-3: space, 4-6: S)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head is 'H'. Let's find the head's position. Looking at row 3, column 2 (since rows are 0-7, columns 0-7, and each row starts with #, so column 0 is #, column 1 is the first cell inside). So row 3, column 2 is H.\n\nThe snake is moving DOWN. The next move direction can't be the reverse, which for DOWN would be UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since current is DOWN, can't go UP). Wait, the rules say the snake cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is DOWN, the snake can't immediately go UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n\nNow, we need to check where the head will move if we choose each direction, and see if that's a valid move (not hitting wall or itself), and if it's an apple.\n\nFirst, current head position: (row 3, column 2). Let's note coordinates as (row, column), where row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So moving DOWN would take the head to (row 4, column 2). Let's check that cell. Row 4, column 2 is space (from row 4: # A SSS# → columns 1 is A, 2 is space, 3-5 S). So (4,2) is empty. That's a valid move. But are there any apples there? No. So the snake would move there, and since no apple, the tail would move (since the snake's length is more than 1, when it moves without eating, the tail is removed).\n\nIf we choose LEFT: direction LEFT would move the head to (row 3, column 1). What's in (3,1)? From row 3: #AH S  # → column 1 is A (apple). So moving LEFT would take the head to an apple. That's good. Then, the snake would eat the apple, grow longer, and the apple is replaced (but in the example, when you eat an apple, the next state shows the head moving there, and the body extends. So the current snake's body is S's. Let's check if moving LEFT would cause collision. The new head position (3,1) is an apple, so no collision with body. Because the body parts are S's. Let's confirm the body positions.\n\nLooking at the current snake's body: All S's. Let's list all S positions.\n\nRow 1: columns 1-5 (so (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5))\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3: (3,3) [since row 3 is #AH S  # → column 3 is S]\nRow 4: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\nRow 5: (5,4), (5,5)\nRow 6: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) [since row 6 is #   SSS# → columns 4-6 are S: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]\n\nSo the head is at (3,2). If moving LEFT to (3,1): (3,1) is A. No S there, so no collision. So that's a valid move. Eating the apple would increase the score, and the snake's length increases. So that's a good option.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT: direction RIGHT would move the head to (3,3). (3,3) is S (from row 3: #AH S  # → column 3 is S). So that's the snake's own body. So moving RIGHT would cause a collision, game over. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nIf we choose DOWN: moving to (4,2) which is empty. That's valid, but no apple. So that's safe but doesn't gain a point.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT (eat apple, safe), DOWN (safe, no apple), RIGHT (collision, game over). So the best choice is LEFT.\n\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# S SSS#\n#AH S  #\n# A SSS#\n#A  S S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 3, column 2) (rows 0-7, columns 0-7, with column 0 and 7 being walls).\n2. **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so UP is invalid.\n3. **Possible Directions**: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 3, column 3). This cell contains 'S' (snake's body), causing a self-collision. **Game over** if chosen.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 4, column 2). This cell is empty (no apple or body), so it is safe but does not increase the score.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 3, column 1). This cell contains 'A' (apple). Eating the apple is safe (no collision) and increases the score by 1. The snake will grow longer, which is beneficial.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the best choice, as it safely eats an apple and improves the score without collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to look at the current game board and the current direction. The snake is currently moving LEFT, and we can't reverse direction, so we can't choose RIGHT. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed).\n\nLet me start by mapping out the current positions of the snake's head and body. The head is 'H'. Let's parse the board row by row. The board is 8x8, with the first and last rows being all '#'. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (walls)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# → columns 1-6: positions (1,1)=S, (1,2)=S, (1,3)=S, (1,4)=S, (1,5)=S\nRow 2: # S SSS# → (2,1)=S, (2,2)=space, (2,3)=S, (2,4)=S, (2,5)=S\nRow 3: #HS S  # → (3,1)=H, (3,2)=S, (3,3)=space, (3,4)=S, (3,5)=space, (3,6)=space\nRow 4: #AA SSS# → (4,1)=A, (4,2)=A, (4,3)=space, (4,4)=S, (4,5)=S, (4,6)=S\nRow 5: #A  S S# → (5,1)=A, (5,2)=space, (5,3)=space, (5,4)=S, (5,5)=space, (5,6)=S\nRow 6: #   SSS# → (6,1)=space, (6,2)=space, (6,3)=space, (6,4)=S, (6,5)=S, (6,6)=S\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at position (3,1). The current direction is LEFT, which means the next move (if we continue LEFT) would take the head to (3,0), which is a wall (since the first column is 0, and row 3, column 0 is part of the wall '#'). So moving LEFT would cause a collision with the wall, which is a game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nNow, the other possible directions are UP or DOWN. Let's check each.\n\nFirst, current direction is LEFT, so possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (but LEFT is invalid as it's a wall). So options are UP or DOWN.\n\nCheck UP: If we turn UP, the new direction is UP. The head is at (3,1). Moving UP would take it to (2,1). What's at (2,1)? Looking at row 2: \"# S SSS#\", so column 1 is 'S' (body part). So moving UP would make the head hit the body (S), which is a collision. That's game over. So UP is invalid.\n\nCheck DOWN: If we turn DOWN, the new direction is DOWN. The head is at (3,1). Moving DOWN would take it to (4,1). What's at (4,1)? Row 4 is \"#AA SSS#\", column 1 is 'A' (an apple). So moving DOWN would eat the apple. That's good. The snake would grow, and the apple at (4,1) would be replaced by the new head, and the body would follow. Let's confirm the next position:\n\nCurrent head (3,1). Moving DOWN to (4,1) which is 'A'. So after moving, the head is at (4,1), and since the snake grows, the body parts shift. The previous positions of the body would follow. Since the snake was moving LEFT, the body was behind the head. Let's think: the snake's body is a chain. The head was moving LEFT, so the previous positions (before the head) would be to the right. For example, in row 3, column 2 is 'S' (body), which is the next part. Then, the body continues in row 3, column 4 is 'S' (from row 3: \"#HS S  #\"), so (3,4) is S. Then row 2, column 3 is S, etc. But the key point is, moving DOWN to (4,1) is an apple, and there's no collision. The position (4,1) is not a wall and not a body part (since the body parts are S, and (4,1) is A). So that's safe.\n\nSo the only possible direction that doesn't cause a collision is DOWN. Because LEFT is wall, UP is body. So the answer should be DOWN.\n\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# S SSS#\n#HS S  #\n#AA SSS#\n#A  S S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current state:\n\n1. **Current Head Position**: The snake's head 'H' is at (row 3, column 1).\n2. **Current Direction**: LEFT. Reversing direction (to RIGHT) is invalid.\n3. **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since RIGHT is reversed).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (3,1) would take the head to (3,0), which is a wall ('#'). Collision with walls ends the game. **Invalid**.\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (3,1) would take the head to (2,1), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). Collision with self ends the game. **Invalid**.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (3,1) would take the head to (4,1), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or self), and eating the apple increases the score and snake length. **Valid**.\n\nThus, the only safe and beneficial direction is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body segments are 'S', and apples are 'A'. The current direction is DOWN, and the epoch is 77, which is well before 100, so the game isn't ending yet.\n\nFirst, let's map out the positions of the snake's head, body, and apples. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# (so positions 1-5 are S, since index starts at 0, the row is from index 0 to 7. So row 1, columns 1-5: S)\nRow 2: # S SSS# (columns 1: S, column 3-5: S)\nRow 3: #SS S  # (columns 1-2: S, column 3: S, columns 4-5: empty)\nRow 4: #HA SSS# (columns 1: H, column 2: A, columns 4-6: S)\nRow 5: #AA S S# (columns 1-2: A, column 3: S, column 5: S)\nRow 6: #   SSS# (columns 3-5: S)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nWait, let's parse each row carefully. Each row is 8 characters (since it's 8x8). Let's index rows from 0 (top) to 7 (bottom), and columns 0 (left) to 7 (right). The '#' are the walls, so columns 0 and 7 in all rows are walls. The inner part is columns 1-6.\n\nRow 0: [0][0] to [0][7] are all #.\nRow 1: [1][0] is #, [1][1] to [1][5] are S, [1][6] is #, [1][7] is #. So positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) are S.\nRow 2: [2][0] is #, [2][1] is S, [2][2] is space, [2][3] is S, [2][4] is S, [2][5] is S, [2][6] is #, [2][7] is #. So (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are S.\nRow 3: [3][0] is #, [3][1] is S, [3][2] is S, [3][3] is space, [3][4] is S, [3][5] is space, [3][6] is #, [3][7] is #. So (3,1), (3,2), (3,4) are S.\nRow 4: [4][0] is #, [4][1] is H (head), [4][2] is A (apple), [4][3] is space, [4][4] is S, [4][5] is S, [4][6] is S, [4][7] is #. So (4,1) is H, (4,2) is A, (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) are S.\nRow 5: [5][0] is #, [5][1] is A, [5][2] is A, [5][3] is S, [5][4] is space, [5][5] is S, [5][6] is #, [5][7] is #. So (5,1), (5,2) are A, (5,3), (5,5) are S.\nRow 6: [6][0] is #, [6][1] is space, [6][2] is space, [6][3] is S, [6][4] is S, [6][5] is S, [6][6] is #, [6][7] is #. So (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) are S.\nRow 7: all #.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake is moving down. The head is at (4,1) (row 4, column 1). Moving down would take the head to row 5, column 1 (since down increases the row number). Let's check where that position is. (5,1) is an A (apple). So if the snake moves down, the head would go to (5,1), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple would increase the score and the snake grows.\n\nBut we need to check if moving down is allowed. The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is DOWN. Reversing would be UP. So moving down is the same direction, which is allowed. The next possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since you can't reverse, so from DOWN, you can't go UP). Wait, the player can choose to change direction to LEFT, RIGHT, or keep moving DOWN (since direction input is one of the four, but you can't reverse). The current direction is DOWN. So the snake is moving down. The player can input a direction, but it can't be UP (since that's reversing). So possible directions are DOWN (same), LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So, the allowed directions are those that are not the reverse of the current direction. Current direction is DOWN. Reverse is UP. So the player can input LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since those are not the reverse). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nNow, let's check each possible direction to see if it leads to a collision (with walls or self) or allows eating an apple.\n\nCurrent head position is (4,1). Let's note the current head's coordinates. Rows are 0 (top) to 7 (bottom). So row 4 is the current row of H. Column 1 is the column.\n\nIf direction is DOWN: next head position is (5,1). Let's check (5,1) in the board. Looking at row 5, column 1: it's an 'A' (apple). So moving down would result in eating the apple. Then, the snake grows. Also, (5,1) is not a wall (since walls are at columns 0 and 7, rows 0 and 7). So (5,1) is within the board (row 5 is between 1-6, column 1 is between 1-6). So no wall collision. Also, (5,1) is an apple, not a body segment. So this is safe.\n\nIf direction is LEFT: next head position would be (4,0). But column 0 is a wall (since the board's edges are walls). So moving left would take the head to (4,0), which is a wall. That's a collision, game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: next head position is (4,2). Let's check (4,2) in row 4. Row 4 is \"#HA SSS#\", so (4,2) is 'A' (apple). So (4,2) is an apple. So moving right would take the head to (4,2), which is an apple. Now, check if that's a valid position. (4,2) is column 2, row 4. Columns 1-6 are inside, so column 2 is okay. No wall. Is (4,2) a body segment? The body segments are 'S's. (4,2) is 'A', so not a body. So moving right would eat the apple, which is good.\n\nIf direction is UP: but current direction is DOWN, so UP is reversing. So direction can't be UP. So UP is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are DOWN, RIGHT. Let's check each.\n\nFirst, direction DOWN: next head (5,1). What's (5,1) in the current board? It's 'A' (apple). So the snake would eat it, grow, and score increases. Then, the new head is (5,1). The body would follow. Since the snake was moving down, the previous head (4,1) becomes part of the body (so 'S'), and the new head is (5,1) (now 'H'). The apple at (5,1) is removed, and a new apple may be generated? Wait, the example given shows that when the snake eats an apple, the next state has the head in the apple's position, and the previous head becomes a body. For example, in the example, the initial head is at (3,1) (row 3, column 1, since the example's board has H in row 3). Direction is DOWN, so moving to row 4, column 1. That position was A. So the new head is (4,1) (H), and the previous head (3,1) becomes S. The other S's shift accordingly. So in that example, the apple is replaced by H, and the previous H becomes S.\n\nIn our current case, if direction is DOWN: head moves from (4,1) to (5,1) (which is A). So the new head is (5,1) (H), the old head (4,1) becomes S. The rest of the body follows. So (5,1) is safe.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT: head moves from (4,1) to (4,2) (which is A). That's (row 4, column 2). (4,2) is A. So the head moves there, eats the apple, becomes H. The old head (4,1) becomes S. Check if (4,2) is a body part. The current body in row 4 is at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) (since row 4 is \"#HA SSS#\", so after H (4,1) and A (4,2), there's a space (4,3), then SSS (columns 4-6). So (4,2) is A, not S, so no collision. So moving right is safe.\n\nSo both DOWN and RIGHT would allow eating an apple, which is good. But we need to check if there's any other considerations. Let's see the positions after moving.\n\nAfter moving DOWN: new head at (5,1). What's around (5,1)? The next possible moves. Let's think about future steps, but maybe that's overcomplicating. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible. Both directions lead to eating an apple now. Are there any other apples? Let's check the current board for other A's.\n\nCurrent apples are at (4,2) (row 4, column 2), (5,1), (5,2). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 4: \"#HA SSS#\" → (4,2) is A.\n\nRow 5: \"#AA S S#\" → (5,1) and (5,2) are A's.\n\nSo there are three apples: (4,2), (5,1), (5,2). So moving DOWN (to (5,1)) would eat one apple, and moving RIGHT (to (4,2)) would eat another.\n\nNow, what's the current direction? The snake is moving DOWN. If we choose to go RIGHT, that's a turn. The next direction would be RIGHT. Then, the next move would be in the direction chosen. But perhaps we need to check if after moving RIGHT, the next position is safe. Let's see:\n\nIf we move RIGHT (direction RIGHT), the head is now at (4,2). The next possible directions would be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since current direction is RIGHT, can't go LEFT). Let's check possible next positions. (4,2) is the new head. Next move in direction RIGHT would be (4,3). Let's check (4,3) in the current board: row 4, column 3 is a space (since row 4 is \"#HA SSS#\", after (4,2) is A, then (4,3) is space, then (4,4) is S). So (4,3) is empty. That's safe.\n\nIf we move DOWN (direction DOWN), new head is (5,1). The next direction could be DOWN (again), RIGHT, or LEFT (since current direction is DOWN, can't go UP). Let's check (5,1) moving DOWN again: (6,1). (6,1) is row 6, column 1. Row 6 is \"#   SSS#\", so (6,1) is space. Safe. So (6,1) is empty.\n\nBut perhaps the key here is that both directions are safe and lead to eating an apple. So which is better? The problem says to choose the direction to eat as many as possible. Since both options are valid, perhaps either is acceptable. But let's check if there's any collision in the current move.\n\nWait, moving LEFT would be (4,0), which is a wall. So invalid. Moving UP is reverse, invalid. So only options are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nIn the current board, moving DOWN to (5,1) (A) is safe. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) (A) is also safe.\n\nBut let's check if the snake's body is in the way for any of these directions. For example, moving RIGHT to (4,2): (4,2) is A, not S, so no collision. Moving DOWN to (5,1): (5,1) is A, not S, so no collision.\n\nSo both directions are valid. The question is which direction to choose. Since the problem requires to pick one of the four directions (but only DOWN, RIGHT are valid), perhaps either is acceptable. But perhaps there's a better choice. Let's see the snake's body positions.\n\nThe snake's body is made of S's. Let's list all S positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,4)\nRow 4: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\nRow 5: (5,3), (5,5)\nRow 6: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nThe head is at (4,1). So the snake's body is in various positions. Let's see if moving RIGHT (to (4,2)) would lead to any future issues, but perhaps not necessary. Since both options are safe, maybe either is correct. However, perhaps the example given in the problem statement shows that when moving in the current direction (DOWN) leads to eating an apple, that's a good choice. But in this case, moving DOWN (current direction) would eat (5,1), and moving RIGHT would eat (4,2). Both are apples. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction that allows the snake to move into a position with more available space. Let's check the area around the head after each move.\n\nIf moving DOWN to (5,1): the new head is at (5,1). The adjacent cells are:\n\nUP: (4,1) (now S, since old head becomes S)\nDOWN: (6,1) (space)\nLEFT: (5,0) (wall)\nRIGHT: (5,2) (A) → which is another apple. So after moving DOWN, the next move could be RIGHT to (5,2) to eat another apple. That's a good path.\n\nIf moving RIGHT to (4,2): the new head is at (4,2). Adjacent cells:\n\nUP: (3,2) (S, from row 3, column 2 is S)\nDOWN: (5,2) (A)\nLEFT: (4,1) (now S)\nRIGHT: (4,3) (space)\n\nSo moving RIGHT, the next move could be DOWN to (5,2) (A) which is another apple. So either direction allows for a subsequent apple.\n\nBut perhaps the best immediate choice is to continue moving in the current direction (DOWN) since it's allowed and leads to an apple. But the problem doesn't state any preference for direction, just to avoid collisions and eat apples. Since both options are valid, but perhaps the answer is either. However, let's check again.\n\nWait, current head is (4,1). Moving DOWN (current direction) would take it to (5,1) (A). That's valid. Moving RIGHT would take it to (4,2) (A). Both are valid. But perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Let's recheck the positions.\n\nRow 4: \"#HA SSS#\" → columns 0: #, 1: H, 2: A, 3: space, 4: S, 5: S, 6: S, 7: #. So (4,1)=H, (4,2)=A. Correct.\n\nRow 5: \"#AA S S#\" → columns 0: #, 1: A, 2: A, 3: S, 4: space, 5: S, 6: #, 7: #. So (5,1)=A, (5,2)=A. Correct.\n\nSo (5,1) is A, (4,2) is A. So moving DOWN (to 5,1) or RIGHT (to 4,2) are both apples. So either direction is acceptable. But the problem requires to pick one. Since the current direction is DOWN, perhaps the player can choose to continue moving down, which is allowed. So the answer could be DOWN or RIGHT. But let's check if there's any other factor.\n\nAnother thing: when the snake moves, the body follows. The length of the snake is the number of S's plus 1 (the head). Let's count the S's in the current board. Let's count all S's:\n\nRow 1: 5 S's (columns 1-5)\nRow 2: 4 S's (columns 1,3-5)\nRow 3: 3 S's (columns 1-2,4)\nRow 4: 3 S's (columns 4-6)\nRow 5: 2 S's (columns 3,5)\nRow 6: 3 S's (columns 3-5)\nTotal S's: 5+4+3+3+2+3= 20. So the snake's current length is 20 +1 (head) = 21. When it eats an apple, the length increases by 1. So after moving, the length becomes 22.\n\nBut that doesn't affect the current direction choice. So, since both directions are valid, perhaps either is correct. But perhaps I made a mistake in considering the directions. Let's check again the movement directions.\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The possible directions the player can input are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since UP is reverse). So the answer must be one of these. Since moving LEFT is into a wall (column 0), that's invalid. So options are DOWN and RIGHT. Both are valid. Which to choose?\n\nIn the example given, when the direction is DOWN and moving down leads to an apple, that's the correct choice. So perhaps in this case, moving down is the correct answer. So I'll go with DOWN.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# S SSS#\n#SS S  #\n#HA SSS#\n#AA S S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,1) (row 4, column 1), moving in the DOWN direction. The goal is to choose a direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) that avoids collisions (walls or self) and allows the snake to eat apples. \n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n- **UP**: Reverses the current direction (DOWN → UP is invalid per rules).  \n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (4,1) would take the head to (4,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall). Collision, game over.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (4,1) takes the head to (4,2), which is an apple (A). No collision (no walls or body segments here). Safe, and the snake eats the apple.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (4,1) takes the head to (5,1), which is an apple (A). No collision (no walls or body segments here). Safe, and the snake eats the apple.  \n\n### Decision:\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN are valid and lead to eating an apple. However, the snake is currently moving DOWN, and continuing in this direction (DOWN) is straightforward and avoids unnecessary turns. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# (so positions (1,1) to (1,5) are 'S', with (1,6) being a wall)\nRow 2: # S SSS# (positions (2,1) 'S', (2,2) empty, (2,3)-(2,5) 'S')\nRow 3: #SS S  # (positions (3,1)-(3,2) 'S', (3,3) empty, (3,4)-(3,5) empty)\nRow 4: #SA SSS# (positions (4,1) 'S', (4,2) 'A', (4,3) empty, (4,4)-(4,5) 'S')\nRow 5: #HA S S# (positions (5,1) 'H' (head), (5,2) 'A', (5,3) empty, (5,4) 'S', (5,5) 'S')\nRow 6: #  ASSS# (positions (6,1)-(6,2) empty, (6,3) 'A', (6,4)-(6,5) 'S')\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, and the epoch is 78, which is well before 100, so the game hasn't ended yet. The snake can't reverse direction, so from DOWN, it can't go UP. The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since reversing is not allowed).\n\nFirst, let's find the head position. The head 'H' is at (5,1) (row 5, column 1, assuming rows are 0-based and columns 0-based). Let's confirm: row 5 is \"#HA S S#\", so index 1 is 'H'.\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, so the next move would be in the direction we choose (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN). Let's check where each direction would take the head.\n\nCurrent head position: (5,1). Let's note coordinates as (row, column). So row 5, column 1.\n\nPossible directions:\n\n1. DOWN: Moving down would take the head to row 6, column 1. Let's check row 6: \"#  ASSS#\", which is row 6, columns 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is ' ', 3 is 'A', 4 is 'S', 5 is 'S', 6 is 'S', 7 is '#'. So (6,1) is empty (space). So moving DOWN would take the head to (6,1), which is safe (not a wall or body). Then, the snake's body would follow. But wait, since the snake moves, the tail would only stay if it ate an apple. Let's check if there's an apple in the next position. (6,1) is empty, so the snake doesn't eat an apple, so the tail would move (the length remains the same, so the last segment of the body is removed).\n\n2. LEFT: Moving left from (5,1) would go to (5,0). But (5,0) is a wall (since row 5 starts with '#'), so that's a collision with the wall. So LEFT is invalid, would end the game. So can't choose LEFT.\n\n3. RIGHT: Moving right from (5,1) would go to (5,2). Let's check row 5, column 2: it's 'A' (from \"#HA S S#\", position 2 is 'A'). So moving RIGHT would take the head to (5,2), which is an apple. Eating the apple would make the snake grow. So the head moves to (5,2), and the body increases (so the tail doesn't get removed this step). Now, we need to check if (5,2) is a body part. The current body parts are all 'S's. Let's list current body positions. Let's look at all 'S's and 'H' (since H is the head).\n\nRow 1: columns 1-5: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\nRow 2: (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\nRow 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (3,5) (Wait, row 3 is \"#SS S  #\", so columns 1 and 2 are 'S' (since 0 is '#', 1 is 'S', 2 is 'S', 3 is ' ', 4 is ' ', 5 is ' ', 6 is '#'). Wait, let's recheck row 3: \"#SS S  #\" — so columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: '#', 7: '#'. So (3,1) and (3,2) are 'S's.\n\nRow 4: \"#SA SSS#\" — columns 0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'. So (4,1), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) are 'S's.\n\nRow 5: \"#HA S S#\" — columns 0: '#', 1: 'H', 2: 'A', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: '#', 7: '#'. So (5,4), (5,5) are 'S's.\n\nRow 6: \"#  ASSS#\" — columns 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'. So (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are 'S's.\n\nSo the body positions (S) are:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5),\n\n(2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5),\n\n(3,1), (3,2),\n\n(4,1), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6),\n\n(5,4), (5,5),\n\n(6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nThe head is at (5,1). So moving RIGHT to (5,2): is (5,2) a body part? Looking at the list, (5,2) is 'A' (apple), not an 'S'. So moving RIGHT would be safe (no collision with body or wall), and the snake eats the apple, which is good. \n\nWhat about moving DOWN: (6,1) is empty. That's safe. But no apple there. So that's a safe move but doesn't increase the score. \n\nNow, are there other apples? Let's check the board for 'A's.\n\nRow 4, column 2: (4,2) is 'A'.\n\nRow 5, column 2: (5,2) is 'A' (the one we just considered).\n\nRow 6, column 3: (6,3) is 'A'.\n\nSo there are three apples left. \n\nIf we move RIGHT, the head goes to (5,2), which is an apple. So that's a good move. Then, the snake grows, so the body will now include the previous head position (5,1) as a new 'S', and the tail (the last 'S') would stay because the snake length increased. So the new head is (5,2), and the body includes (5,1) as part of the body now.\n\nIs there any collision in moving RIGHT? (5,2) is an apple, not a body part. So that's safe. \n\nWhat about moving DOWN? (6,1) is safe. But no apple. \n\nWhat about moving LEFT? That's a wall, so game over. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo the possible directions are RIGHT or DOWN. Between these, moving RIGHT allows eating an apple, which is better. So the best direction is RIGHT.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# S SSS#\n#SS S  #\n#SA SSS#\n#HA S S#\n#  ASSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5,1) (row 5, column 1), and the current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot choose UP. \n\nAnalyzing possible moves:\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (5,1) leads to (5,0), which is a wall. This would cause a collision, ending the game. Invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (5,1) leads to (5,2), which contains an apple ('A'). This position is not occupied by the snake's body, so it is safe. Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake. Valid and beneficial.\n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (5,1) leads to (6,1), which is an empty space. This is safe but does not result in eating an apple. Less optimal than RIGHT.\n\nThe best choice is to move RIGHT to eat the apple and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid surrounded by walls ('#'). Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# → So positions (1,1) to (1,5) are 'S' (body segments), since the row starts with # and ends with #.\nRow 2: #AS SSS# → Let's index columns from 1 to 6 (since 0 and 7 are walls). So (2,1) is 'A' (apple), (2,2) is 'S', (2,3) is space, (2,4) 'S', (2,5) 'S', (2,6) 'S'.\nRow 3: #SS S  # → (3,1) 'S', (3,2) 'S', (3,3) space, (3,4) 'S', (3,5) space, (3,6) space.\nRow 4: #SA SSS# → (4,1) 'S', (4,2) 'A' (apple), (4,3) space, (4,4) 'S', (4,5) 'S', (4,6) 'S'.\nRow 5: #SH S S# → (5,1) 'S', (5,2) 'H' (head), (5,3) space, (5,4) 'S', (5,5) space, (5,6) 'S'.\nRow 6: #  ASSS# → (6,1) space, (6,2) space, (6,3) 'A' (apple), (6,4) 'S', (6,5) 'S', (6,6) 'S'.\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake is moving to the right. The snake's head is at (5,2) (row 5, column 2). Since the direction is RIGHT, the next move would be to (5,3) (row 5, column 3) if we continue RIGHT. Let's check what's there. In row 5, column 3 is a space (from the board: \"#SH S S#\" → positions 1: S, 2:H, 3: space, 4:S, 5: space, 6:S). So (5,3) is empty. But wait, we need to check if moving in that direction would cause a collision with the body or the wall.\n\nBut wait, the snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is RIGHT. The possible directions the player can input are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, but cannot reverse. So the reverse of RIGHT is LEFT. So the player can't choose LEFT as the next direction. So possible directions are RIGHT (current direction, allowed), UP, or DOWN.\n\nNow, let's think about the snake's body. The snake's head is at (5,2). The body segments are the 'S's. Let's list all the 'S' positions:\n\nRow 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\nRow 2: (2,2), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\nRow 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,4)\nRow 4: (4,1), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\nRow 5: (5,1), (5,4), (5,6)\nRow 6: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nSo the head is at (5,2). The next position if moving RIGHT is (5,3). Let's check if (5,3) is a wall (no, since walls are at 0 and 7 in rows and columns). (5,3) is space, so no collision with body or wall. So moving RIGHT is safe here.\n\nBut maybe there's an apple nearby. Let's check where the apples are. Apples are 'A's:\n\nRow 2, column 1: (2,1)\nRow 4, column 2: (4,2)\nRow 6, column 3: (6,3)\n\nSo the head is at (5,2). Let's see possible directions:\n\nIf we move RIGHT (current direction), head goes to (5,3). That's a space. No apple, so the snake doesn't grow. The body would follow. The new head is (5,3), and the tail (the last segment) would be removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nIf we move UP (from current direction RIGHT, allowed). UP direction: head would move from (5,2) to (4,2). Let's check (4,2): in row 4, the entry is \"#SA SSS#\", so (4,2) is 'A' (apple). Oh! So moving UP would take the head to (4,2), which is an apple. That's good because eating the apple increases the score and the snake grows. Also, we need to check if (4,2) is a body part. (4,2) is 'A', so not 'S'. So moving UP would be safe and get an apple.\n\nWait, (4,2) is (row 4, column 2). Let's confirm: row 4 is \"#SA SSS#\". Columns 1: S, 2: A, 3: space, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S. So yes, (4,2) is 'A'. So moving UP (from current direction RIGHT) is allowed (since you can turn up from right). The direction change from RIGHT to UP is allowed (not reversing). So that's a valid direction.\n\nIf we move DOWN, the head would go from (5,2) to (6,2). Let's check row 6: \"#  ASSS#\". Columns 1: space, 2: space, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S. So (6,2) is space. No apple there. So moving DOWN would take the head to (6,2), which is safe but no apple.\n\nSo the options are:\n\n- RIGHT: (5,3) → safe, no apple.\n- UP: (4,2) → apple, safe.\n- DOWN: (6,2) → safe, no apple.\n\nMoving UP would eat an apple, which is better. So the best direction is UP.\n\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n#AS SSS#\n#SS S  #\n#SA SSS#\n#SH S S#\n#  ASSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 5, column 2).\n2. **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n3. **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n4. **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (2,1), (4,2), and (6,3).\n5. **Collision Check**:\n   - **RIGHT**: Next position is (5,3), which is empty (safe, no apple).\n   - **DOWN**: Next position is (6,2), which is empty (safe, no apple).\n   - **UP**: Next position is (4,2), which contains an apple ('A') (safe, and eating the apple increases the score).\n\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple, which is beneficial for growth and score. Other directions do not yield apples. Thus, UP is the best choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game board and the snake's position. Let's start by looking at the board provided.\n\nThe game board is an 8x8 grid with walls as '#'. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# (so positions (1,1) to (1,5) are 'S', body segments)\nRow 2: #AS SSS# → Let's break it down. (2,1) is 'A' (apple), (2,2) is 'S', (2,3) is ' ', (2,4) 'S', (2,5) 'S', (2,6) 'S'\nRow 3: #SS S  # → (3,1) 'S', (3,2) 'S', (3,3) ' ', (3,4) 'S', (3,5) ' ', (3,6) ' '\nRow 4: #SHASSS# → (4,1) 'S', (4,2) 'H' (head), (4,3) 'A' (apple), (4,4) 'S', (4,5) 'S', (4,6) 'S'\nRow 5: #SS S S# → (5,1) 'S', (5,2) 'S', (5,3) ' ', (5,4) 'S', (5,5) ' ', (5,6) 'S'\nRow 6: #  ASSS# → (6,1) ' ', (6,2) ' ', (6,3) 'A' (apple), (6,4) 'S', (6,5) 'S', (6,6) 'S'\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake is moving up. Let's find the head position. In row 4, column 2: (4,2) is 'H'. Since the direction is UP, the next position the head will move to is (3,2) (since moving up decreases the row number by 1). Let's check what's at (3,2). Looking at row 3, which is \"#SS S  #\", so column 2 is 'S' (since (3,1) is 'S', (3,2) is 'S'). Oh, that's a body segment! If the snake continues moving UP, the head would hit its own body, causing a collision and the game ends. So we can't go UP.\n\nNow, the snake can't reverse direction. The current direction is UP, so reversing would be DOWN. But can the snake turn to LEFT or RIGHT? Let's see the possible directions. The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, but can't reverse. So from UP, the allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP (but UP is bad here). So we can choose LEFT or RIGHT, or DOWN? Wait, the rule says \"cannot reverse its direction (i.e., cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly)\". So if current direction is UP, the reverse is DOWN. So turning to DOWN is not allowed. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (but UP is bad). So options are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check where the head is (4,2). Let's note the coordinates. Let's assume rows are 0 (top) to 7 (bottom), columns 0 (left) to 7 (right). So row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom.\n\nHead is at (row 4, column 2). Current direction is UP (moving towards row 3). So next position if direction remains UP is (3,2), which is 'S' (body) → collision. So UP is invalid.\n\nNow, possible directions are LEFT (column 1), RIGHT (column 3), or DOWN (row 5). But DOWN is reverse of UP, which is not allowed. So only LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check moving LEFT: direction LEFT. The head would move to (4,1). What's (4,1)? Looking at row 4: \"#SHASSS#\", column 1 is 'S' (body). So (4,1) is 'S' → collision. So moving LEFT would hit the body.\n\nMoving RIGHT: direction RIGHT. The head moves to (4,3). What's (4,3)? Row 4, column 3 is 'A' (apple). Oh, that's an apple. So if the snake turns RIGHT, the head moves to (4,3) which is an apple. Then, the snake eats the apple, grows, and the score increases. Also, moving RIGHT is allowed because current direction is UP, and RIGHT is not the reverse (reverse is DOWN). So turning RIGHT is a valid direction.\n\nLet's confirm: current direction is UP. Turning to RIGHT is allowed (since it's not the reverse direction). The next position when moving RIGHT is (4,2) → (4,3). (4,3) is 'A' (apple). So that's safe. After moving, the head is at (4,3), the body will follow. Since the snake ate an apple, it grows, so the tail doesn't shrink. So this is a good move.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN? The reverse direction (UP to DOWN) is not allowed. So the player can't choose DOWN. So the only valid directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. But UP and LEFT lead to collision, RIGHT leads to eating an apple. So the best direction is RIGHT.\n\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n#AS SSS#\n#SS S  #\n#SHASSS#\n#SS S S#\n#  ASSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 4, column 2).  \n2. **Current Direction**: UP. The snake is moving upward.  \n3. **Collision Checks**:  \n   - **UP**: Next position would be (row 3, column 2), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). Collision occurs.  \n   - **LEFT**: Next position would be (row 4, column 1), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). Collision occurs.  \n   - **DOWN**: Reversing direction (UP → DOWN) is invalid per rules.  \n   - **RIGHT**: Next position is (row 4, column 3), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe, allows the snake to eat the apple, grow, and avoid collision.  \n\nThe only valid and safe direction is RIGHT, as it avoids collision and allows the snake to eat an apple.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by analyzing the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, surrounded by walls ('#'). The snake's head is 'H', body parts are 'S', apples are 'A'. The current direction is RIGHT, and we're at epoch 81, so there are 19 more epochs left (since the game ends after 100).\n\nFirst, let's map out the positions. Let's list each row (rows 0 to 7, top to bottom):\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# (columns 1 to 6: ' ', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S')\nRow 2: #AS SSS# (columns 1: 'A', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S')\nRow 3: #SS SA # (columns 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'A', 6: ' ')\nRow 4: #SSHSSS# (columns 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: 'H', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S')\nRow 5: #SS S S# (columns 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: 'S')\nRow 6: #  ASSS# (columns 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S')\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at row 4, column 3 (assuming rows are 0-7, columns 0-7, with (0,0) top-left). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 4 is \"#SSHSSS#\", so positions:\n\nColumn 0: '#'\nColumn 1: 'S'\nColumn 2: 'S'\nColumn 3: 'H' → head is at (4,3)\nColumn 4: 'S'\nColumn 5: 'S'\nColumn 6: 'S'\nColumn 7: '#'\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. So the snake is moving right. The next position if moving RIGHT would be (4,4). Let's check what's there. In row 4, column 4 is 'S' (from the row \"#SSHSSS#\", column 4 is 'S'). So if the snake moves RIGHT, the head would go to (4,4), which is part of the snake's body. That's a collision, so the game would end. So moving RIGHT is bad.\n\nNow, the snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is RIGHT, the opposite direction is LEFT. So the snake can't turn LEFT (reverse). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (but RIGHT is collision, so can't).\n\nWait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Wait, the example says: \"cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly\". So if current direction is RIGHT, the reverse is LEFT. So the snake cannot choose LEFT as the direction (since that's reversing). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. But moving RIGHT is into a body part (S), which is a collision. So RIGHT is invalid. So options are UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check possible directions:\n\nCurrent head position: (4,3). Current direction is RIGHT. The next move is determined by the direction we choose. Let's check each possible direction (excluding LEFT, which is reverse):\n\nOption 1: UP. Moving UP would take the head from (4,3) to (3,3). Let's check (3,3) on the board.\n\nRow 3 is \"#SS SA #\", columns 0-7:\n\n0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: 'A', 6: ' ', 7: '#'\n\nSo (3,3) is ' ' (empty). So moving UP would be to (3,3). Is that safe? Let's check if that's a wall or body. (3,3) is empty, so safe. Then, the snake's body would follow. Since the snake is moving, the tail would move if it doesn't eat an apple. But let's see if there's an apple in (3,3). (3,3) is ' ', so no apple. So the snake would move, head to (3,3), and the tail would move (since no apple eaten, length remains same). So that's a safe move.\n\nOption 2: DOWN. Moving DOWN would take the head from (4,3) to (5,3). Let's check (5,3). Row 5 is \"#SS S S#\", columns:\n\n0: '#', 1: 'S', 2: 'S', 3: ' ', 4: 'S', 5: ' ', 6: 'S', 7: '#'\n\nSo (5,3) is ' ' (empty). So moving DOWN would take the head to (5,3), which is safe. No apple there, so tail moves. That's safe.\n\nOption 3: RIGHT. As before, (4,4) is 'S' (body), collision. So invalid.\n\nOption 4: LEFT. Reverse direction, which is not allowed. So invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are UP or DOWN. Now, we need to check if there are apples nearby that we can reach to increase the score. Let's look for 'A's on the board.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 1: # SSSSS# → no A.\nRow 2: #AS SSS# → column 1: 'A' (position (2,1))\nRow 3: #SS SA # → column 5: 'A' (position (3,5))\nRow 6: #  ASSS# → column 3: 'A' (position (6,3)), column 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S' → row 6, column 3 is 'A' (so (6,3))\n\nSo apples are at (2,1), (3,5), (6,3).\n\nCurrent head is at (4,3). Let's see the positions of these apples.\n\nApple at (3,5): (row 3, column 5). That's to the right and up from the head. The head is (4,3). To reach (3,5), the snake would need to move up then right, or right then up, but need to check path.\n\nApple at (6,3): (row 6, column 3). That's below the head (current head row 4, so row 6 is two down). So (6,3) is two steps down from (4,3). Let's check the path from (4,3) to (6,3). The positions in between: (5,3) is ' ', (6,3) is 'A'. So if the snake moves down, then down again, it can reach that apple. Let's see:\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. If we choose DOWN now, next move is (5,3) (safe). Then, in the next step, the direction could be DOWN again (since current direction would then be DOWN, and reversing would be UP). So moving DOWN again would take to (6,3), which is the apple. That would be a good move, as it would eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nApple at (2,1): (row 2, column 1). That's up and to the left. The head is (4,3). To reach (2,1), the snake would need to move up twice and left twice, but the path may be blocked by the snake's body. Let's check row 2, column 1 is 'A'. The path from (4,3) to (2,1):\n\n(4,3) → (3,3) (if move up), then (2,3). Let's check row 2: \"#AS SSS#\" → row 2, column 3 is ' ' (since the row is columns 0-7: 0='#',1='A',2='S',3=' ',4='S',5='S',6='S',7='#'). So (2,3) is ' '. Then (2,2) is 'S' (row 2, column 2 is 'S'). So to get to (2,1), from (2,3), you need to move left twice. (2,3) → (2,2) (S, body, collision) → can't go that way. So that apple may be hard to reach.\n\nApple at (3,5): (row 3, column 5). Let's see. Head is (4,3). To reach (3,5), the snake could move up to (3,3), then right to (3,4) (row 3, column 4 is 'S'), which is body. So (3,4) is 'S' (row 3: \"#SS SA #\", column 4 is 'S'). So (3,4) is body. So moving right from (3,3) would hit body. So that's not safe.\n\nApple at (6,3): (row 6, column 3). Let's check the path. From (4,3), moving down to (5,3) (which is ' '), then down again to (6,3) (which is 'A'). Let's confirm (5,3) and (6,3):\n\nRow 5, column 3: ' ' (from \"#SS S S#\" → column 3 is ' ').\n\nRow 6, column 3: 'A' (from \"#  ASSS#\" → column 3 is 'A').\n\nSo moving down twice would reach that apple. Let's see the next steps. Current epoch is 81. So after this move (epoch 81), next epochs 82, 83, etc. Let's say in epoch 81, we choose DOWN. Then head moves to (5,3). Then in epoch 82, the direction could be DOWN again (since current direction would be DOWN now), moving to (6,3), which is the apple. Then, the snake eats the apple, grows, score increases. That's a good plan.\n\nIf we choose UP now (epoch 81), the head moves to (3,3). Let's see what's around (3,3). Then, possible directions. The current direction would be UP. So possible directions next would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't reverse to DOWN). Let's see (3,3) is ' ', so next positions. Maybe there's a path, but the apple at (6,3) is more accessible.\n\nSo the best direction now is DOWN, to move towards the apple at (6,3). Because moving DOWN now (epoch 81) would take the head to (5,3), then next move (epoch 82) can be DOWN again to (6,3) where the apple is. That way, we can eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nSo the answer should be DOWN.\n\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n#AS SSS#\n#SS SA #\n#SSHSSS#\n#SS S S#\n#  ASSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 4, column 3).  \n2. **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT is invalid).  \n3. **Collision Check for RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,4), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'), causing a collision. Thus, RIGHT is invalid.  \n4. **Valid Directions**: UP or DOWN (since LEFT is reversed and RIGHT is unsafe).  \n\n### Analysis of UP:  \nMoving UP would take the head to (3,3), which is empty (' '). This is safe but does not lead directly to an apple.  \n\n### Analysis of DOWN:  \nMoving DOWN takes the head to (5,3), which is empty (' '). This is safe. From (5,3), the next move (if direction remains DOWN) would reach (6,3), where an apple ('A') is located. This allows the snake to eat the apple, grow, and increase the score.  \n\nGiven the proximity of the apple at (6,3) and the safe path via DOWN, the best choice is DOWN.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. Let's start by looking at the game board. The user mentioned to repeat the current game board first, so I'll note that down.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n#AS SSS#\n#SS SA #\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSH  S#\n#  ASSS#\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, and the current epoch is 82. The snake is moving down. The snake can't reverse direction, so if the current direction is DOWN, the snake can't go UP next. The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (but maybe that's not possible if there's a collision).\n\nFirst, let's identify the snake's head. The head is 'H'. Looking at the board, the line with 'H' is the fifth line from the top (since rows are 0-7, let's index them). Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: # SSSSS# (so columns 1-6: S S S S S)\nRow 2: #AS SSS# (columns 1: A, 2: S, 3: space, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S)\nRow 3: #SS SA # (columns 1:S, 2:S, 3: space, 4:S, 5:A, 6: space)\nRow 4: #SSSSSS# (columns 1-6: S S S S S S)\nRow 5: #SSH  S# (columns 1:S, 2:S, 3:H, 4: space, 5: space, 6:S)\nRow 6: #  ASSS# (columns 1: space, 2: space, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at row 5, column 3 (assuming rows are 0-7, columns 0-7; row 0 is top, column 0 is left). Let's confirm: row 5 is \"#SSH  S#\", so column 0 is '#', column 1 is 'S', column 2 is 'S', column 3 is 'H', columns 4 and 5 are spaces, column 6 is 'S', column 7 is '#'. So H is at (5,3).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN, which means the next move would be to row 6, column 3 (since moving down increases the row index). Let's check where (6,3) is. Row 6 is \"#  ASSS#\", column 3 is 'A' (since columns 0 is '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'A', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S'). So if the snake moves DOWN (current direction), the head would go to (6,3), which is an 'A' (apple). That's good because eating the apple would increase the score and the snake grows. But wait, we need to check if moving there is possible (no collision with walls or self).\n\nWait, the walls are around the edges, so row 7 is all walls. The current head is at row 5, column 3. Moving DOWN would take it to row 6, column 3. Let's check the cell (6,3): it's 'A', so that's safe. The snake's body is 'S' cells. Are there any 'S' cells at (6,3)? No, because row 6, column 3 is 'A', so moving there is okay. So moving DOWN would eat the apple, which is good.\n\nBut wait, what's the snake's body? The snake's body is all the 'S's. Let's think about the snake's current path. The head is at (5,3). The body parts are the 'S's connected to it. Let's track the snake's body. Since the snake is moving down, the previous position (before the last move) would be above the head. The head was moving down, so previous head position was row 4, column 3. Let's check row 4: \"#SSSSSS#\", column 3 is 'S' (since all columns 1-6 are S). So the body is connected. So the snake's body includes (5,1), (5,2) (since row 5 is \"#SSH  S#\", columns 1 and 2 are S), (4,1-6) (all S), etc. But the key is that when moving, the new head position (row 6, column 3) is 'A', which is not a wall or body, so it's safe.\n\nBut wait, what if the direction is changed? The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since can't reverse to UP). Let's check possible directions:\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. Possible next directions: can't go UP. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nLet's check each:\n\n1. DOWN: new head at (6,3). What's there? 'A' (apple). So eating it, score increases. The snake grows, so the tail doesn't move (since when you eat an apple, the snake's length increases, so the tail remains, and the head moves forward). So the new head is (6,3), which is safe. No collision.\n\n2. LEFT: direction LEFT. The head would move to (5,2). Let's check (5,2). The current cell (5,2) is 'S' (from row 5: \"#SSH  S#\", column 2 is 'S'). So that's the snake's own body. Collision! So moving LEFT would cause the snake to hit itself. That's a loss. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n3. RIGHT: direction RIGHT. The head would move to (5,4). Let's check (5,4). The current cell (5,4) is ' ' (space, since row 5 is \"#SSH  S#\", column 4 is space). So that's empty. But we need to check if moving there would cause collision. The new head is (5,4). Is (5,4) a wall? No, walls are at column 0 and 7, row 0 and 7. So (5,4) is within the board. Are there any 'S's there? No, (5,4) is a space. So moving RIGHT would be possible, but there's no apple there, so no score increase. But is that safe?\n\nBut let's check the current direction. The snake is moving DOWN. If the player changes direction to RIGHT, that's allowed (since RIGHT is not the reverse of DOWN; reverse of DOWN is UP). So direction change to RIGHT is allowed.\n\nBut moving RIGHT to (5,4) is safe, but there's no apple. So that's a possible move but not as good as eating the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,3) which is an apple. That's better.\n\nSo the best move is to continue moving DOWN, eat the apple, and grow. Because that's the only safe direction that gives a point, and the other possible directions (LEFT is collision, RIGHT is safe but no apple).\n\nSo the answer should be DOWN.\n\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n#AS SSS#\n#SS SA #\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSH  S#\n#  ASSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current state:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at row 5, column 3.\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN (snake moves one square down per epoch).\n- **Possible Directions**: The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid). Options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n- **Collision Checks**:\n  - **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (5, 2), which is occupied by 'S' (snake's body). This causes a self-collision (game loss).\n  - **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (5, 4), which is empty space (safe but no apple).\n  - **DOWN**: Moving down takes the head to (6, 3), which is occupied by 'A' (apple). This is safe (no wall\/body collision) and results in eating the apple (score +1, snake grows).\n\nThe only safe direction that improves the score is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by looking at the game board provided.\n\nThe game board is 8x8, with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's head is 'H', body is 'S', apples are 'A'. The current direction is DOWN, and the epoch is 83. The snake can't reverse direction, so from DOWN, it can't go UP. The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (but wait, the direction input is what the player gives, which changes the movement direction. The snake moves in the direction it's facing, which is updated by the input, except reversing isn't allowed. So current direction is DOWN, so the next direction can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since UP is the reverse and not allowed).\n\nFirst, let's map out the board. Let's list each row from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7):\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #ASSSSS#\nRow 2: #AS SSS#\nRow 3: #SS SA #\nRow 4: #SSSSSS#\nRow 5: #SSS  S#\nRow 6: #  HSSS#\nRow 7: ######## (all walls)\n\nSo row 6 is the 7th row (since starting from 0). Let's find the position of 'H' (head). Looking at row 6: \"#  HSSS#\". Let's index columns from 0 to 7. So row 6, column 2 is ' ', column 3 is 'H' (since the string is \"#  HSSS#\", which is positions 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H', 4: 'S', 5: 'S', 6: 'S', 7: '#'). So head is at (6,3) (row 6, column 3).\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. So normally, the next move would be in the current direction, which is DOWN. But the player can change direction to LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since UP is reverse and not allowed).\n\nLet's check where the head would move if direction is DOWN: moving down from (6,3) would take it to row 7, column 3. But row 7 is a wall (all '#'), so that's a collision with the wall. So moving DOWN would end the game. So that's bad.\n\nNext, direction LEFT: moving left from (6,3) would take the head to (6,2). Let's check that position. Row 6, column 2 is ' ' (from \"#  HSSS#\" — positions 0: '#', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'H'...). So (6,2) is empty (not a wall, not a body part). So moving LEFT would take the head to (6,2). Now, check if that square has an apple. The current square (6,2) in row 6 is ' ', so no apple. Then, the snake's body would follow. Since the snake's length is determined by the number of 'S' and 'H' (since it starts at length 1, and each apple increases length by 1). Let's count the number of 'S' and 'H' to find current length. Let's count all 'S' and 'H' in the board:\n\nRow 1: #ASSSSS# → 5 S (since A is at column 1, then SSSSS (columns 2-6) → 5 S)\nRow 2: #AS SSS# → A at 1, S at 2, then space at 3, then SSS (columns 4-6) → 1 + 3 = 4 S\nRow 3: #SS SA # → SS (columns 1-2), space at 3, S at 4, A at 5, space at 6 → 2 +1 = 3 S\nRow 4: #SSSSSS# → SSSSSS (columns 1-6) → 6 S\nRow 5: #SSS  S# → SSS (columns 1-3), spaces at 4-5, S at 6 → 3 +1 =4 S\nRow 6: #  HSSS# → H at 3, SSS (columns 4-6) → 3 S\nTotal S: 5 +4 +3 +6 +4 +3 = 25. H is 1. So total length is 26. So when moving, the head moves to (6,2), and the tail (the last S) would be removed unless the head eats an apple. Since (6,2) is empty, no apple, so the tail is removed. So the new head is (6,2), and the body shifts. But we need to check if (6,2) is part of the current body. Let's see: the current body is all S's. (6,2) is ' ', so not part of the body. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nNext, direction RIGHT: moving right from (6,3) would take the head to (6,4). (6,4) in row 6 is 'S' (since row 6 is \"#  HSSS#\", so columns 4 is 'S'). So that's the snake's own body. Collision with self, game over. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo possible directions are LEFT (safe) or DOWN (wall collision, game over) or RIGHT (body collision, game over). So the only safe direction is LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#ASSSSS#\n#AS SSS#\n#SS SA #\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSS  S#\n#  HSSS#\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, and the snake's head is at (row 6, column 3). The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible next directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (6,3) would take the head to row 7, column 3, which is a wall. This causes a collision and ends the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (6,3) would take the head to (6,4), which is occupied by the snake's own body ('S'). This causes a self-collision and ends the game.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (6,3) takes the head to (6,2), which is an empty space (no wall or body). This is a safe move.  \n\nThe only safe direction is LEFT. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction for the snake. First, I need to understand the current game state. Let's start by repeating the game board as instructed.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n########\n#ASSSSS#\n#AS SSS#\n#SS SA #\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSS  S#\n# HS SS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, and we're at epoch 84. The game ends at epoch 100, so there's still 16 moves left. The snake's head is 'H', and the body is 'S'. Let's find where the head is. Looking at the board, the last row (7th row, 0-based index 6) has \"# HS SS#\". So the head 'H' is at position (6,2) assuming rows are 0-7 and columns 0-7. Let's confirm the coordinates: row 6 (since the first line is row 0), columns 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is 'H', 3 is ' ', 4 is 'S', 5 is 'S', 6 is '#'. So H is at (6,2).\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. So the snake is moving left. Let's see where the next position would be if it continues LEFT. Moving left from (6,2) would take it to (6,1). What's in (6,1)? The row is \"# HS SS#\", so column 1 is ' ', so that's empty. But wait, need to check if that's a valid move. The snake can't reverse direction. Current direction is LEFT, so the previous direction was not RIGHT (since reversing is not allowed). So possible directions to turn are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. Because the snake can't reverse, so if current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. So possible options are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nNow, check the possible next positions for each direction:\n\n1. Continue LEFT: next head position (6,1). What's there? Let's check the current board. The 6th row (row index 6) is \"# HS SS#\". So positions are:\nRow 6: columns 0 is '#', 1 is ' ', 2 is 'H', 3 is ' ', 4 is 'S', 5 is 'S', 6 is '#', 7 is '#' (since it's 8 characters). So (6,1) is ' ' (empty). So moving left here is possible. But we need to check if that square is part of the snake's body. The body is 'S's. Let's check the current body positions.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: #ASSSSS# → columns 1 is 'A', 2-6 are 'S's.\nRow 1: #AS SSS# → columns 1 is 'A', 2 is 'S', 3 is ' ', 4-6 are 'S's.\nRow 2: #SS SA # → columns 1-2 are 'S's, 3 is 'S', 4 is ' ', 5 is 'A', 6 is ' '.\nRow 3: #SS SA # → Wait, maybe I should list all S positions. Let's list all the cells (row, column) that are 'S' or 'H':\n\nRow 0: columns 1 (A), 2-6 (S) → S at (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)\nRow 1: column 1 (A), 2 (S), 4-6 (S) → S at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\nRow 2: columns 1 (S), 2 (S), 3 (S), 5 (A) → S at (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\nRow 3: #SS SA # → columns 1 (S), 2 (S), 3 (S), 5 (A) → S at (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\nRow 4: #SSSSSS# → columns 1-6 (S) → S at (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\nRow 5: #SSS  S# → columns 1-3 (S), 6 (S) → S at (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,6)\nRow 6: # HS SS# → column 2 (H), 4 (S), 5 (S) → H at (6,2), S at (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo the head is at (6,2). The body is all the S positions listed.\n\nNow, moving LEFT (current direction) would take the head to (6,1). Let's check (6,1). Is (6,1) a wall? No, the walls are the '#' around the edges, so (6,0) is '#', (6,1) is ' ', so not a wall. Is (6,1) part of the snake's body? Let's check if (6,1) is in the S positions. From above, row 6's S positions are (6,4), (6,5). (6,1) is ' ', not S. So moving LEFT is possible. No collision here.\n\nNext, possible direction: UP. The snake is currently moving LEFT. Turning UP is allowed (since it's not reversing). UP direction would mean the head moves from (6,2) to (5,2). Let's check (5,2). What's (5,2) in the current board? Row 5 is \"#SSS  S#\". So columns 1-3 are S's. So (5,1) is S, (5,2) is S, (5,3) is S. So (5,2) is 'S' (body part). So moving UP would make the head collide with the body. That's a loss. So UP is invalid.\n\nNext direction: DOWN. Current direction is LEFT, turning DOWN is allowed (not reversing). DOWN direction would take the head from (6,2) to (7,2). But the board is 8x8, rows 0-7. Row 7 is the bottom wall: the last line is \"########\", which is row 7. So (7,2) is '#', a wall. So moving DOWN would hit the wall, causing a loss. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo the only possible directions are LEFT (current direction, allowed) or maybe check if other directions are possible. Wait, the possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN (since can't reverse to RIGHT). But UP leads to body collision, DOWN leads to wall collision. So only LEFT is possible.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm. Let's recheck (5,2). Row 5 is \"#SSS  S#\", so columns 1-3 are S's. So (5,1) is S, (5,2) is S, (5,3) is S. So (5,2) is S. So moving UP (from (6,2) to (5,2)) would hit the body. So UP is invalid.\n\nMoving DOWN: (6,2) → (7,2). Row 7 is \"########\", so (7,2) is '#', which is a wall. So collision. So invalid.\n\nSo the only possible direction is LEFT. So the snake must move LEFT to survive this step. Let's check if moving LEFT leads to any apple. The next position (6,1) is ' ', no apple. So no score increase, but the snake moves there. The body will follow as per snake movement. Since the snake's length is the number of S and H. Let's count the current length. The head is H (1), and all the S's. Let's count S's:\n\nRow 0: 5 S's (cols 2-6)\nRow 1: 4 S's (cols 2,4-6)\nRow 2: 3 S's (cols 1-3)\nRow 3: 3 S's (cols 1-3)\nRow 4: 6 S's (cols 1-6)\nRow 5: 4 S's (cols 1-3,6)\nRow 6: 2 S's (cols 4-5)\nTotal S's: 5+4+3+3+6+4+2 = 27. So total length is 27 +1 (H) = 28. When moving, the tail (the last S) will move if the snake doesn't eat an apple. Since (6,1) is empty, the snake moves, the head goes to (6,1), and the tail (the last S in the body) is removed. So the body shifts.\n\nBut the key here is that the only safe direction is LEFT. Any other direction leads to collision. So the answer should be LEFT.\n\n\n########\n#ASSSSS#\n#AS SSS#\n#SS SA #\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSS  S#\n# HS SS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 6, column 2) (0-indexed).\n2. **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid).\n3. **Possible Directions**: LEFT, UP, DOWN (since RIGHT is reversed).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (6,2) leads to (6,1). Checking the board, (6,1) is empty (no wall or snake body). This is a valid, safe move.\n- **UP**: Moving up from (6,2) leads to (5,2). The cell (5,2) is occupied by 'S' (snake body), causing a self-collision. Invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (6,2) leads to (7,2). Row 7 is a wall ('#'), causing a wall collision. Invalid.\n\nThe only safe direction is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Okay, let's try to figure out the best direction to move the snake next. First, I need to understand the current game state. The game board is 8x8, with walls around. The snake's head is 'H', body 'S', apples 'A'. The current direction is LEFT, and we're at epoch 85. The game ends at epoch 100, so we have 15 moves left.\n\nFirst, let's parse the game board. Let's list out each row:\n\nRow 0: ######## (all walls)\nRow 1: #ASSSSS# (so positions 1,1 is A; 1,2-6 are S; 1,7 is #)\nRow 2: #AS SSS# (positions 2,1 is A; 2,2 is S; 2,3 is space; 2,4-6 are S; 2,7 is #)\nRow 3: #SS SA # (positions 3,1-2: S; 3,3: S; 3,4: space; 3,5: A; 3,6: space; 3,7: #)\nRow 4: #SSSSSS# (positions 4,1-6: S; 4,7: #)\nRow 5: #SSS  S# (positions 5,1-3: S; 5,4-5: space; 5,6: S; 5,7: #)\nRow 6: #HSS  S# (positions 6,1: H; 6,2-3: S; 6,4-5: space; 6,6: S; 6,7: #)\nRow 7: ######## (walls)\n\nSo the head 'H' is at (6,1) (assuming rows are 0-7, columns 0-7; so row 6, column 1). The current direction is LEFT, which would mean the snake is moving towards column 0. But the next move in direction LEFT would take the head to (6,0), which is a wall (since row 6, column 0 is part of the first # in the row). So moving LEFT now would cause a wall collision, ending the game. That's bad. So we can't go LEFT.\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction. Since current direction is LEFT, the opposite is RIGHT. So we can't reverse, so RIGHT is allowed? Wait, the rule says \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" Oh, right, so if current direction is LEFT, turning to RIGHT is a reverse, which is not allowed. So the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or keep going LEFT (but LEFT is into a wall). So possible directions are UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's check where the head is and possible moves. Head is at (6,1). Let's list possible directions:\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So possible directions to turn are UP, DOWN (since can't reverse to RIGHT). Let's check each:\n\n1. UP: Moving UP from (6,1) would take the head to (5,1). What's at (5,1)? Looking at row 5: #SSS  S#. So row 5, column 1 is S (since positions 5,1-3 are S). So (5,1) is part of the snake's body. So moving UP would collide with the body, which ends the game. So UP is invalid.\n\n2. DOWN: Moving DOWN from (6,1) would take the head to (7,1). But row 7 is ########, so (7,1) is a wall. So moving DOWN would hit a wall. That's also a collision. Oh no, that's bad.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in coordinates. Let's confirm the rows and columns. Let's index rows from top (row 0) to bottom (row 7). Columns left (0) to right (7).\n\nSo row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom.\n\nRow 6 is the row with H: \"#HSS  S#\". So row 6's columns are:\n\nColumn 0: #\nColumn 1: H\nColumn 2: S\nColumn 3: S\nColumn 4: (space)\nColumn 5: (space)\nColumn 6: S\nColumn 7: #\n\nSo H is at (row 6, column 1).\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. So moving LEFT would be to column 0, row 6. Column 0 of row 6 is # (a wall). So moving LEFT hits the wall.\n\nPossible directions: can't reverse (so can't go RIGHT). So options are UP (row 5, column 1) or DOWN (row 7, column 1).\n\nRow 5: \"#SSS  S#\" → columns 0: #, 1: S, 2:S, 3:S, 4: space, 5: space, 6:S, 7: #. So (5,1) is S (body). So moving UP (to 5,1) → collision with body.\n\nRow 7 is all #, so (7,1) is #. Moving DOWN (to 7,1) → wall collision.\n\nWait, what about RIGHT? The current direction is LEFT, so reversing to RIGHT is not allowed. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo all possible directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT) lead to collision? That can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the body positions.\n\nLet me re-examine the board. Let's list each cell (row, column) and what's in it.\n\nRow 0 (index 0): columns 0-7: all #. So (0,0)-(0,7): #.\n\nRow 1 (index 1): # A S S S S S # → columns 0: #, 1: A, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S, 7: #.\n\nRow 2 (index 2): # A S  S S S # → columns 0: #, 1:A, 2:S, 3: (space), 4:S, 5:S, 6:S, 7: #.\n\nRow 3 (index 3): # S S  S A  # → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3: (space), 4:S, 5:A, 6: (space), 7: #.\n\nRow 4 (index 4): # S S S S S S # → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4:S, 5:S, 6:S, 7: #.\n\nRow 5 (index 5): # S S S  (space) (space) S # → columns 0: #, 1:S, 2:S, 3:S, 4: (space), 5: (space), 6:S, 7: #.\n\nRow 6 (index 6): # H S S  (space) (space) S # → columns 0: #, 1:H, 2:S, 3:S, 4: (space), 5: (space), 6:S, 7: #.\n\nRow 7 (index 7): all #.\n\nSo the head is at (6,1). Let's check the adjacent cells:\n\n- LEFT (column 0, row 6): # → wall. Collision.\n- RIGHT (column 2, row 6): S → body. Because (6,2) is S. So moving RIGHT (which is reverse of current direction LEFT) is not allowed. Even if it's possible, but the direction is invalid. So can't choose RIGHT.\n- UP (row 5, column 1): (5,1) is S (from row 5: columns 1 is S). So body. Collision.\n- DOWN (row 7, column 1): row 7, column 1 is # → wall. Collision.\n\nWait, that's all four directions leading to collision. But that can't be possible. Maybe I made a mistake in the body positions. Let's check row 6 again. The row is \"#HSS  S#\", so columns 0 is #, 1 is H, 2 is S, 3 is S, 4 is space, 5 is space, 6 is S, 7 is #. So (6,2) and (6,3) are S (body), (6,6) is S.\n\nWhat's the snake's body structure? Since the snake is moving LEFT, the previous position would be to the right of H. Because when moving LEFT, the head was at (6,2) before, then moved to (6,1). So the body segments follow. So the body after H would be (6,2), (6,3), etc.\n\nSo the snake's body is in positions (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)? Not sure, but the key is, the adjacent cells to H are:\n\nLEFT: (6,0) → wall.\n\nRIGHT: (6,2) → S (body).\n\nUP: (5,1) → S (body).\n\nDOWN: (7,1) → wall.\n\nSo all possible moves (since direction can't reverse) are UP, DOWN, or LEFT, but all lead to collision. That would mean the game is about to end. But maybe I made a mistake in the direction possibilities.\n\nWait, the rule says: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So if current direction is LEFT, the next direction can be UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. So the player can choose to keep moving LEFT (even though it's into a wall), but that's a collision. Alternatively, turn UP or DOWN, but those also hit the body or wall.\n\nSo in this case, all possible directions lead to a collision, so the snake will die regardless of the direction chosen. But the problem says to choose a direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nLet me check again. Let's list all adjacent cells to H (6,1):\n\n- LEFT (6,0): wall → collision. So moving LEFT is invalid.\n- RIGHT (6,2): S → body. But can we choose RIGHT? The current direction is LEFT. The reverse is RIGHT, which is not allowed. So direction can't be RIGHT. So even if (6,2) is S, the direction is invalid. So the player can't choose RIGHT.\n- UP (5,1): S → body. So moving UP here would collide with body. So direction UP is invalid.\n- DOWN (7,1): wall. So moving DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo all possible directions (allowed directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT) result in collision. So the answer would be that any direction leads to game over, but the player has to choose a direction. But according to the problem statement, the player must provide a direction. So perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the snake's body isn't in (5,1). Let's check row 5 again. Row 5 is \"#SSS  S#\". So columns 1, 2, 3 are S. So (5,1) is S. So (5,1) is part of the body. So moving UP from (6,1) to (5,1) would hit the body.\n\nWhat about (6,4) and (6,5)? Those are spaces. Are they accessible? The head is at (6,1). To reach those, the snake would have to turn RIGHT (but that's reverse of current direction LEFT, which is not allowed). So the next move direction can't be RIGHT, so the head can't go to (6,2) (which is S anyway).\n\nIs there any apple left? Let's check the board for 'A's.\n\nRow 1: column 1 is A.\n\nRow 2: column 1 is A.\n\nRow 3: column 5 is A.\n\nSo there are three apples left. But the snake can't reach them because all moves lead to collision.\n\nSo in this scenario, the snake is in a position where all possible moves (allowed directions) result in collision, so the game ends. The player must choose a direction, but any choice leads to game over. So perhaps the answer is any direction, but according to the rules, we need to pick one. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the positions.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the rows and columns reversed. Let's think of rows as y-coordinate (top to bottom 0-7) and columns as x-coordinate (left to right 0-7). So (row, column) is (y, x).\n\nH is at (6,1) → y=6, x=1.\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT → moving in the x direction, decreasing x by 1 each step. So next position would be x=0, y=6. Which is a wall (since x=0 is a wall). So moving LEFT → wall.\n\nIf the direction is UP, which is y-1 (since UP is towards top, y decreases). So from (6,1), moving UP would be (5,1). Check (5,1): row 5, column 1. Row 5 is \"#SSS  S#\", which in terms of columns (x=0 to x=7) is:\n\nx=0: #, x=1: S, x=2:S, x=3:S, x=4: (space), x=5: (space), x=6:S, x=7: #. So (5,1) is S (body). So moving UP → collision.\n\nIf direction is DOWN, moving DOWN is y+1. So (6,1) → (7,1). Row 7 is all #, so (7,1) is # → wall. Collision.\n\nIf direction is RIGHT (reverse of LEFT), which is not allowed. So direction can't be RIGHT. So even if (6,2) is S, the direction is invalid. So the player can't choose RIGHT.\n\nSo all possible directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT) result in collision. So the snake will die regardless. But the problem requires us to pick a direction. Maybe I made a mistake in the body positions. Let's check row 3 again. Row 3 is \"#SS SA #\". So x=0: #, x=1:S, x=2:S, x=3: (space), x=4:S, x=5:A, x=6: (space), x=7: #. So (3,5) is A.\n\nIs there any path to reach that apple? The snake's head is at (6,1). To reach (3,5), the snake would need to move right, up, etc. But current direction is LEFT, and the snake is surrounded by its own body and walls. So no possible moves. Therefore, any direction chosen will result in collision. So the answer is any direction, but perhaps the problem expects us to choose one. Since the current direction is LEFT, which leads to a wall, but the other options also lead to collision. So perhaps the answer is LEFT, but that's a collision. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the head is at (6,1), and moving RIGHT (even though it's reverse direction) is allowed? Wait, the rule says \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" So if the current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT. So the player can't input RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. All of which result in collision. So the snake will die, but the player must choose a direction. So the answer could be any of them, but perhaps the correct answer is to choose a direction that doesn't immediately collide, but in this case, there's none. So perhaps the answer is LEFT (current direction), even though it's a wall.\n\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#ASSSSS#\n#AS SSS#\n#SS SA #\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSS  S#\n#HSS  S#\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is located at position (6, 1) (row 6, column 1). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Let's analyze possible moves:\n\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (6, 1) would take the head to (6, 0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall in all rows). This causes a wall collision, ending the game.  \n2. **UP**: Moving UP from (6, 1) would take the head to (5, 1). Row 5, column 1 is 'S' (snake's body), resulting in a self-collision, ending the game.  \n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (6, 1) would take the head to (7, 1), which is a wall (row 7 is entirely walls). This causes a wall collision, ending the game.  \n4. **RIGHT**: Reversing direction (from LEFT to RIGHT) is not allowed per the rules, so this direction is invalid.  \n\nAll valid directions (LEFT, UP, DOWN) lead to collisions. Since the snake must choose a direction, even if it results in game over, the only allowed directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Given the current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse, the most immediate direction (though fatal) is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#ASSSSS#\n#AS SSS#\n#SS SA #\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSS  S#\n#HSS  S#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 86\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","epoch":86,"seed":12,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
