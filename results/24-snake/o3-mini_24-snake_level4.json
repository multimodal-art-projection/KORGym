When moving DOWN, the snake’s head will go from (4,2) to (5,2), where there is an apple ('A'). This move is allowed (it’s not a reversal of LEFT) and will help increase the score by eating the apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S A  #\n#AH    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nAfter a close analysis, notice that the snake’s head is at row 5, column 2 and its current direction is DOWN. However, if we change direction to LEFT the head will move from (5,2) to (5,1) – a cell containing an apple. Eating that apple will immediately increase the score and grow the snake, and this move is allowed because turning LEFT does not reverse the current direction. Therefore, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S A  #\n#HS   A#\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe optimal move is to go DOWN: moving \"DOWN\" from the current head at row 5, column 1 will take the snake to row 6, column 1, where it will eat an apple. Eating an apple not only increases the score by one but also grows the snake’s length, which is beneficial in the game. Since moving LEFT would cause a collision with the wall and UP would not yield any immediate benefit, DOWN is the best choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S A  #\n#SS   A#\n#H     #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the situation:\n• The snake’s head is at row 6, column 1 and is currently moving DOWN.\n• Moving DOWN would send the head into the bottom wall (row 7 contains only walls).\n• Moving LEFT from the head (to row 6, column 0) would also hit a wall.\n• Reversing direction (UP) is not allowed since a 180° turn is forbidden.\n• Therefore, the only safe move is to go RIGHT to row 6, column 2.\n\nThus, the best move to keep the snake safe is: RIGHT\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#SS   A#\n#SH    #\n########\n\nGiven the current head is at row 7, column 3 (if we consider rows starting at 1) and moving RIGHT is the only non-reversing safe move (since UP would lead to collision with the snake’s body and DOWN would hit the wall), the correct move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#S    A#\n#SSH   #\n########\n\nGiven the current snake’s head at row 6, column 3 and its current direction being RIGHT, we cannot choose DOWN because that would hit the wall (row 7 is all walls). Also, we cannot choose LEFT (reversal of direction). Our safe options are RIGHT and UP. Evaluating both, moving RIGHT from (6,3) lands on (6,4), a safe empty cell and it positions the snake a bit closer to the nearby apple (the apple at row 4, column 4 has a Manhattan distance of 2 if we are at (6,4)). Moving UP to (5,3) is also safe, but both choices result in a similar Manhattan distance to the apple. In these situations it is usually best to continue in the current direction when it is safe. Therefore, the best move is to continue going RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#     A#\n#SSSH  #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, I see that from the snake’s head at row6, column4 (with current movement RIGHT), the nearest apple is at (4,4) (the apple on row4, column4), which is best reached by turning UP. Moving RIGHT would eventually try to reach the apple at (5,6), but that apple is a bit further in terms of moves. Also, moving DOWN is not safe because it will hit the wall. Thus, turning UP maximizes the chance to eat an apple quickly without colliding. \n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#   H A#\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP and its head is located on row 5, column 4, moving UP will take the head to row 4, column 4. That cell contains an apple ('A'), so choosing UP will allow the snake to consume the apple, increase in length, and earn 1 point. This move is safe because it doesn't cause the snake to collide with its body or the wall, and it is not the reverse of the current movement direction. \n\nAnswer: UP","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#   S A#\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nBased on the board configuration and the snake’s current direction (UP), a smart move is to steer the snake toward the nearby apple. The head is at the center row (row 4, column 4 if we index from 0) and an apple lies on row 5, column 6. By turning RIGHT, the snake will begin moving in the direction that brings it closer to that apple while safely avoiding walls and its own body.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SH #\n#   S A#\n#  SS  #\n########\n\nI choose to continue in the current direction. From the head’s position at row4, column5 moving RIGHT takes it to row4, column6, which is safe and moves us closer to the apple at row5, column6. Staying with the current RIGHT direction minimizes sudden turns and potential collisions, while offering a clear path towards an apple on the subsequent move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSH#\n#   S A#\n#   S  #\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, moving RIGHT is not safe because it would hit the wall. Moving UP would be safe but does not yield an apple. However, by moving DOWN, the snake's head at row 5, column 6 reaches the apple at row6, column6. Thus, moving DOWN not only avoids collision but also grants immediate benefit by eating an apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#   SSS#\n#   S H#\n#   S  #\n########\n\nConsidering the board, the snake’s head is currently at (row5, column6) and moving DOWN. The only non-reversing moves allowed are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Moving RIGHT leads into a wall, so it isn’t safe. Moving DOWN would simply head into an empty space at (row6, column6), but that move takes the snake even further away from the apples (notably the apple at (row1, column5)). On the other hand, choosing LEFT moves the head to (row5, column5), which is safe and brings the snake closer to the apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","The current game board is:\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#   SSS#\n#   SHS#\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at row 5, column 5 and the current moving direction is LEFT, we examine the potential moves. Moving LEFT puts the head into the cell at (5,4), which is currently occupied by a snake segment. However, because that cell is the tail’s position and the tail will be removed in the process (no apple is eaten in this move), it is safe to move there. Other moves, such as UP, would lead directly into another body segment that isn’t being freed, and RIGHT is disallowed because it directly reverses the current direction. The DOWN move is safe but does not improve the situation toward reaching an apple.\n\nThus, the optimal move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

To reach that apple without directly reversing its DOWN direction, the snake can turn RIGHT so that in the following move it can go DOWN to eat the apple. Thus, the best move is to change its direction to RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# SH   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake's head is located at row 4, column 3 and the current direction is RIGHT, the optimal move is to change the direction to DOWN. This move causes the snake to move from (4,3) to (5,3), where an apple is located. Eating the apple increases the score by one and makes the snake grow. Also, moving downward doesn't reverse the current RIGHT direction, so it is a valid change of direction.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#   A A#\n#      #\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n#  HA  #\n#      #\n########\nBased on the board, the snake’s head is at row6, column4 and it’s moving DOWN. However, there’s an apple immediately to the RIGHT at (row6, column5). Turning RIGHT (which is allowed because it’s not a reversal from DOWN) will move the head into the apple, grow the snake, and increase the score. Thus, the best move is to input RIGHT.\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#   A A#\n#      #\n# S   A#\n# SS   #\n#  SH  #\n#      #\n########\n\nAfter evaluating the board, we see that the snake’s head is currently at row 5, column 4 and its moving direction is RIGHT. There are three apples on the board—two on the top row and one at row 3, column 6. Moving UP would bring the head closer to the upper apples (especially the one at (1,4)) and the one at (3,6) while avoiding a backwards turn (which is not allowed), and it positions the snake favorably for future moves. Therefore, the best move is to go UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let's review the current board first:\n\n########\n#   A A#\n#      #\n#     A#\n# SSH  #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is UP and the snake's head is at position (4,4) (with its body parts immediately to its left and below), the safe moves available are UP or RIGHT (since LEFT would immediately hit a body cell and DOWN is not allowed as a reversal of the current direction). There is an apple at (3,6) – if we continue UP the head will move to (3,4), which is free and positions us a couple of moves away from that apple. On the other hand, moving RIGHT would put the head at (4,5), also safe but not as naturally aligned with the current travel direction. Sticking with the current heading (UP) seems the best option: it is safer, avoids immediate collision, and maintains the momentum towards the upward region where at least one apple is accessible within a few moves.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#   A A#\n#      #\n#   H A#\n#  SS  #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current state and that the snake’s head is at row 3, column 4 moving upward, continuing with the same UP direction will steer the head towards the apple located at row 1, column 4 in two moves. This move keeps the snake moving in its current safe path and positions it well to consume an apple on the following epochs. \n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#   A A#\n#   H  #\n#   S A#\n#   S  #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head is at row 2, column 4 and the current direction is UP, moving UP from (2,4) will take the head to row 1, column 4 where an apple is located. Eating the apple will increase the score and grow the snake, so it is an optimal move. \n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#   H A#\n#   S  #\n#   S A#\n#   S  #\n#  SS  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nBased on the current board, the snake’s head is at row 2, column 5 and is currently moving UP. Moving UP would immediately result in hitting the wall (row 1 is all walls), so that option is out. The remaining choices are LEFT and RIGHT. Moving RIGHT will take the snake from (2,5) to (2,6), which is an empty space, but it gets the head closer to the adjacent apple at (2,7) for a likely next move. There’s no immediate danger in moving RIGHT, and it is a step toward scoring by enabling the snake to potentially pick up the apple on the next move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#   SHA#\n#   S  #\n#   S A#\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nBy moving RIGHT, the snake's head will advance from its current position at row 2, column 5 to row 2, column 6 where an apple is located. Eating that apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake's length, making RIGHT the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n# A SSH#\n#   S  #\n#   S A#\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#    A #\n########\nAfter analyzing the board with the snake’s head at (1,6) and its current direction being RIGHT, moving RIGHT would lead into the wall, and turning UP would also hit the wall. Since reversing direction (LEFT) is not allowed, the only safe option is to turn DOWN, which moves the head to (2,6), an empty cell. This avoids a collision and keeps the game going.\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# A SSS#\n#   S H#\n#   S A#\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nFrom the current position of the snake’s head at row 2, column 6 and with the current direction being DOWN, moving down takes the head to row 3, column 6 where there is an apple. Eating this apple will increase the score and cause the snake to grow, which is beneficial. Therefore, the best move is to continue in the DOWN direction.\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# A SSS#\n#   S S#\n# A S H#\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 3, column 6 and it is currently moving DOWN. We cannot turn right because that would hit the wall, and we can’t choose UP because it would be a direct reversal. Moving DOWN would take the head to (4,6), which is safe but doesn’t bring it any closer to an apple. On the other hand, if we turn LEFT, the head moves to (3,5) and that puts it on a path that appears to be heading toward the apple at (3,2). Therefore, the best move is to turn LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Repeating the current game board:\n########\n# A SSS#\n#   S S#\n# A SHS#\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake's head (H) is located at row 4, column 6 and is currently moving LEFT. The square directly to the LEFT (row4, col5) is occupied by its own body (S), so moving LEFT is not viable. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., RIGHT), leaving the UP and DOWN options.\n\nLooking at the board:\n• Moving UP from (row4, col6) leads to row3, col6 which is a free space. However, there is an apple (A) at row2, col3—not directly reachable if we move UP.\n• Moving DOWN leads from row4 to row5, then row6, and finally row7, where an apple (A) is directly in column 6. This is a clear vertical path with no obstacles.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to go DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# A SSS#\n#   S S#\n# A  SS#\n#    H #\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at (4,5) and the apple at (6,5) is directly below the head, the best move is to continue DOWN. By choosing DOWN, the snake will move from (4,5) to (5,5) on this epoch and will be one step away from eating the apple on the following move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n# A SSS#\n#     S#\n# A  SS#\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#    A #\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head is at row 5, column 5 and the current direction is DOWN, moving DOWN will bring the head directly to the cell at row 6, column 5, which contains an apple. This move results in the snake eating the apple, scoring a point, and growing in length. Therefore, the best move is to continue in the DOWN direction.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n# A SSS#\n#     S#\n# A  SS#\n#    SA#\n#    S #\n#    H #\n########\n\nGiven the snake's current direction is DOWN and the head is located at row 6, column 5, moving DOWN would immediately collide with the wall. The only legal options that avoid immediate death are turning either LEFT or RIGHT. Evaluating the situation, there is an apple at position (4,6). If the snake turns RIGHT, its head will move to (6,6) and then it can move upward toward the apple in subsequent moves. This path appears more direct to the apple compared to turning LEFT. Therefore, the best next move is to change direction to RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# A  SS#\n#     S#\n# A  SS#\n#    SA#\n#    S #\n#    SH#\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT, but the head at (row 7, column 7 in our board’s coordinate if we count walls as boundaries) is adjacent to a wall in the RIGHT direction. Moving RIGHT would immediately collide with the wall. Also, reversing to LEFT is not allowed, and moving DOWN would also hit a wall. The only safe direction is UP, which moves the head from its current position to a free space (specifically from row 7, column 7 to row 6, column 7 if we ignore the walls’ indices). Thus, based on the board and rules, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# A   S#\n#     S#\n# A  SS#\n#    SA#\n#    SH#\n#    SS#\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 5, column 6 and the current movement direction is UP. Looking at the available moves:\n• UP: Moving the head from (5,6) to (4,6) lands on an apple ('A'), which is safe and increases the score.\n• LEFT: Moving to (5,5) would hit an existing snake body ('S').\n• RIGHT: Moving to (5,7) would hit the wall (‘#’).\n\nSince reversing (DOWN) is not allowed, the optimal move is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# A   S#\n#     S#\n#AA  SS#\n#    SH#\n#    SS#\n#    SS#\n########\nAfter analyzing the available moves for the snake's head at row 5, column 7 in the current board—with all adjacent cells being either a wall or occupied by its own body (and none being the tail cell that would vacate this turn)—there is no safe move. In such a situation, the snake has no option that avoids an immediate collision. Since the snake is currently moving UP and we must give one of the four directions as our answer, the optimal (default) choice is to continue moving in its current direction.\n\nAnswer: UP"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

Since the snake is currently moving LEFT but is allowed to change direction (except going directly RIGHT), choosing UP will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow, and increase the score—making this the best move.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# H    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nI choose to maintain our current UP direction. Moving UP will bring the snake’s head from (3,2) to (2,2), positioning it one step closer to the apple at (2,1) for a potential score increase in the next move while keeping the movement safe.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#AH    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\nI choose LEFT because the snake’s head at (2,2) can immediately move left to position (2,1), where an apple is located. This move will allow the snake to grow and increase the score without risk of collision. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#HS    #\n# S    #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at position (2,1) moving LEFT. Moving LEFT would immediately hit the wall (position (2,0)), so that option is unsafe. Turning RIGHT is disallowed because reversing direction is not allowed. Out of the valid moves, UP and DOWN are potential choices. Moving UP puts the head at (1,1), which is safe but does not steer it toward any of the nearby apples. Moving DOWN would relocate the head to (3,1), a safe spot that might be more favorable in eventually reaching the apple at (6,1). Therefore, the best move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#SS    #\n#H     #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nAfter examining the board, the current snake head is at row 3, column 1 and the snake is moving DOWN. Continuing DOWN moves the head to row 4, column 1, which is empty and safely leads toward an apple located at row 6, column 1 in forthcoming moves. Thus, moving DOWN is a good choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#H   A #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake is a vertical body at column 1 (with its head at row 4, column 1) and is moving DOWN. There is an apple directly below in row 6, column 1 if the snake continues moving down (after an empty cell at row 5, column 1, the head will eventually reach row 6, column 1 to eat the apple). Since moving DOWN keeps the snake on course to get an apple without colliding with a wall (and reversing is not allowed), the optimal move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#S     #\n#S   A #\n#H     #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 5, column 1 and is currently moving DOWN. Looking at the square directly below the head at row 6, column 1, we see an apple ('A'). By moving DOWN, the snake will eat this apple, which will increase the score and cause the snake to grow. Also, moving DOWN is legal (it is not a reverse of the current direction), so the best move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#S     #\n#S   A #\n#S   A #\n#H  A  #\n########\n\nSince the snake’s current direction is DOWN, continuing that way would move the head from (6,1) into row 7, where there is a wall. Moving LEFT would also lead to a wall (column 0 is a wall). The best option is to turn RIGHT so that the head moves from (6,1) to (6,2) safely, putting it on an empty square and setting up a potential path toward the apples.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#S   A #\n#S   A #\n#SH A  #\n########\n\nBased on the board setup, the snake’s head is at row 6, column 2 and is currently moving RIGHT. Continuing in the RIGHT direction will move the snake’s head to row 6, column 3—an empty space—and position the snake to eventually reach the apple located at row 6, column 4. There are no immediate threats by keeping its current trajectory, so the optimal move is to continue RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board as provided:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#S   A #\n#SSHA  #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head (H) is at row 7, column 3 (ignoring border indices) and the snake is moving RIGHT. Moving RIGHT will bring the snake’s head into the square at row 7, column 4 which contains an apple (A). This means that the snake will eat the apple, its score will increase by 1, and it will grow in length. No risk of collision exists with this move and it is a beneficial action.\n\nThus, the direction I choose is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#S   A #\n#SSSH A#\n########\n\nBased on the current board and the fact that the snake’s head is at (row7, col4) moving RIGHT and the cell immediately to the right (row7, col5) is empty (no apple, no collision), the safest action is to keep moving RIGHT. This will advance the snake into an empty cell, update the head position to (7,5) as 'H', turn the previous head cell into a body segment 'S', and remove the tail segment (which was at (row6, col1)). This move avoids collision with the wall and the snake’s own body.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#SSSSHA#\n########\n\nSince the snake is moving RIGHT and the next cell (row7, column7) contains an apple, moving RIGHT will cause the snake to eat the apple, increasing its score by 1 and its length by 1. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#SSSSSH#\n########\n\nI evaluated the snake’s possible moves. The current head is at row 7, column 7 when counting from 1 (or row6, col6 in 0-indexed form) and is moving RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would cause a collision with the wall (the cell to the right is a '#' on the board). Moving DOWN would also lead into a wall, as the row below is the bottom boundary. The only safe alternative is to turn UP. \n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    AH#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 5, column 6, moving UP. However, there is an apple immediately to its left at (row 5, column 5). Moving UP would move the head to (row 4, column 6) – an empty cell – while moving LEFT will put the head onto an apple, causing the snake to grow and earn a point. (The snake is allowed to turn LEFT when moving UP, as it is not a direct reversal.) Therefore, the best move is to go LEFT.\n\nSimulating the move:\n• When moving LEFT, the snake’s head moves from (5,6) to (5,5) where an apple is located.\n• The apple is eaten and the snake grows in length (so no tail removal happens this move).\n• The old head at (5,6) turns into a body segment.\n• The updated row 5 becomes: \"#    HS#\" (with 'H' now at col5 and 'S' at col6).\n\nThus, based on the board and rules, the chosen direction is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    HS#\n# SSSSS#\n########\nI analyzed the options from the snake’s current head position at row6, col5 (in the board’s coordinates). Since the snake is moving LEFT, it can continue LEFT, UP, or DOWN (it can’t reverse to RIGHT). Moving LEFT leads to an empty cell at (row6, col4) with no apple. Moving DOWN from (row6, col5) would cause the head to move into row7, col5, where there is a snake body segment, causing a collision. However, moving UP from (row6, col5) positions the snake’s head at (row5, col5) where an apple 'A' is located. Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and safely grows the snake. Therefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let's start by repeating the current game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n# A   A#\n#      #\n#    H #\n#    SS#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at (row 4, column 5) and is currently moving UP. Looking at the board, if we continue with the current direction, the snake’s head will move from (4,5) to (3,5). There is no obstacle at (3,5) and the move does not reverse direction. Moreover, this move keeps us on a safe path and eventually positions us to get closer to the apple at (row 1, column 5). Therefore, keeping the direction as UP is the best decision.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n# A   A#\n#    H #\n#    S #\n#    SS#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at (3,5) and is currently moving UP. The square immediately above (at (2,5)) is empty, and continuing UP on the following move will put the head at (1,5) where an apple is located. Since moving UP is safe (it avoids colliding with the snake’s body or walls) and it sets up the snake to eat an apple soon, I choose to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n# A  HA#\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#    SS#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 3, column 6 and the snake is currently moving UP. There is an apple directly above the head at row 2, column 6, and an apple to the right at row 3, column 7. Moving UP (continuing in the current direction) immediately steers the head to the apple at row 2, column 6, which is safe and results in an immediate gain. The DOWN direction would lead to a collision with the body, and turning LEFT would move to an empty space. Therefore, the best move is to continue UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#    H #\n# A  SA#\n#    S #\n#A   S #\n#    SS#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nBy analyzing the board, the snake’s head at (1,5) moving UP cannot continue forward because that would hit the top wall. The only legal turns are LEFT or RIGHT. If we turn RIGHT, the new head position becomes (1,6); then on the next epoch we could turn downward to reach the apple at (2,6) in just one move. This move is safe and positions us to eat an apple quickly. Therefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#    SH#\n# A  SA#\n#    S #\n#A   S #\n#    SS#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head (H) is at row 1, column 6 and it is currently moving RIGHT. However, moving RIGHT is not an option because going right would hit a wall at column 7. Moving UP would also lead into the wall (row 0 is part of the border). The only move that both avoids immediate collision and places the snake’s head on an apple is moving DOWN – that is, going from row 1, column 6 to row 2, column 6 where there is an apple. This move will increase your score and is allowed since it isn’t a reversal of the current RIGHT direction.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n# A  SS#\n# A  SH#\n#    S #\n#A   S #\n#    SS#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is currently at (row 2, column 6) and it is moving in the DOWN direction. The available moves (without reversing to UP) are:\n• DOWN – which would move the head to (3,6). Checking row 3 “#    S #”, column 6 is an empty space.\n• LEFT – which would move the head to (2,5), but that cell is already occupied by the snake’s body (a non‐tail segment), and thus would result in a collision.\n• RIGHT – which would send the head to (2,7), a wall cell (since the right edge is “#”) and is not allowed.\n \nSince moving DOWN is the only safe option and it does not immediately lead to an apple (the apple positions are at (1,2), (2,2), and (4,1)), continuing in the current direction is the best move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n# A  SS#\n# A  SS#\n#    SH#\n#A   S #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 3, column 6 and moving in the current DOWN direction. Checking each neighboring cell:\n• UP (row 2, column 6) is occupied by part of the snake.\n• LEFT (row 3, column 5) is also occupied by a snake segment.\n• RIGHT (row 3, column 7) is a wall.\n• DOWN (row 4, column 6) is empty.\n\nThus, the only safe move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# A  SS#\n# A  SS#\n#    SS#\n#A   SH#\n#    SS#\n#      #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board:\n• The snake’s head “H” is at row 4, column 6.\n• Its current moving direction is DOWN.\n• The cell immediately DOWN from the head (row 5, column 6) is occupied by “S”. However, by examining the connections between the snake segments, we can infer that the “S” at (5,6) is the tail (it touches only one other snake part). In a typical snake move, if no apple is eaten the tail cell is removed at the same time the head moves.\n• Other potential moves (LEFT, RIGHT, and UP) either move into a solid snake part that isn’t the tail or into a wall; also, the snake is not allowed to reverse (UP would be disallowed).\nTherefore, the safe move is to continue in the current direction: DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The current direction is RIGHT, but since continuing right would only take the snake into an empty cell at (row 5, column 6) and none of the apples are directly to the right, we look for a direction that leads closer to an apple. \n\nThere is an apple at row 3, column 4 (based on visual inspection of board rows where the apples appear in the upper part, notably the apple in row 3 in the inner grid corresponds to (row2, col3) when ignoring walls). By turning UP, the snake would move from (row 5, column 5) to (row 4, column 5) (again, when counting with borders the indices shift, but it is clear that going UP brings the snake closer to the cluster of apples in the upper rows). Also turning UP is valid because the snake cannot reverse its direction (so turning LEFT would be reversing the horizontal component) and between continuing RIGHT or switching to DOWN also does not approach the apples. \n\nThus, the optimal move is to change direction to UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# A   A#\n#  A   #\n#   H  #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake's head is at row 3, column 4 and is currently moving UP. The square ahead (row 2, column 4) is safe, and by continuing UP the snake can later maneuver left to collect the apple at (2,3). There is no need to change direction immediately, so staying on course with UP is a good choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# A   A#\n#  AH  #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nI analyzed the board and noticed that the snake’s head is at row 2, column 4 and the available apple at row 2, column 3 can be immediately reached by turning left from the current UP direction, which avoids any collisions. Therefore, the optimal move is to turn LEFT.\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# A   A#\n#A HS  #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nThe best move is to continue moving LEFT. Moving left from the current head position (2,3) lands on (2,2), which is safe and will help the snake eventually reach the apple at (2,1) in a subsequent move. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n# A   A#\n#AHSS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nMy move: The snake’s head is located at row 2, column 2 and the current direction is LEFT. Moving left from (2,2) takes the head to (2,1) where there is an apple. This move is valid and will cause the snake to eat the apple, increase the score by one, and grow in length (with the head moving to (2,1), the former head at (2,2) turning into a body segment, and the rest of the body remaining unchanged). \n\nThus, my answer is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# A   A#\n#HSSS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving LEFT but moving left would make it hit the wall, we must choose a different valid direction. We cannot choose RIGHT because it is directly reversing the current direction. Among the valid options, moving UP will bring the head closer to the apple at row 1 (specifically near the apple at (1,2)), making it a better choice than moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#HA   A#\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake's head \"H\" is at row 1, column 1 and is currently moving UP. Continuing UP would hit the wall, and turning LEFT would also result in a collision with the wall. Since reversing (going DOWN) is not allowed, the only safe move is to turn RIGHT. This move will take the snake to row 1, column 2 where an apple \"A\" is located, allowing the snake to eat the apple and grow.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n#SHA  A#\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nBased on the board and rules, the snake’s head is at row 1, column 2 and is currently moving RIGHT. The cell immediately to the RIGHT (row 1, column 3) contains an apple. Moving RIGHT will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score. Therefore, the optimal move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Repeating the current game board:\n########\n#SSH  A#\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head is at row 1, column 3 and it is currently moving RIGHT, the simplest safe choice is to continue moving RIGHT. This move will have the head shift to position (1,4), which is empty and will gradually bring the snake closer to the apple at (1,6) while avoiding collision with walls or its own body. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","The current game board is:\n########\n#SSSH A#\n#SS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nConsidering that the snake’s head is at the position of 'H' (row 1, column 4) and is currently moving RIGHT, the next cell to the RIGHT (row 1, column 5) is free. By moving right, the snake will eventually have the chance to eat the apple at row 1, column 6 on the subsequent move. Also, turning UP would lead directly into a wall (row 0 is the boundary), and turning DOWN doesn’t provide the direct path to the apple. So, the best safe option is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSSSHA#\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nConsidering the snake is currently moving RIGHT and its head is positioned at row1, column5 with an apple right next to it at row1, column6, the optimal move is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple. This move is valid under the game rules and should increase the snake’s score and length.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSSSSH#\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A  A#\n########\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSSSS#\n#     H#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nConsidering the snake is moving downward from its current head position at row 2, column 6, going down (to row 3, column 6) is a safe and logical move as it avoids walls and the snake’s own body while working towards the apples located further down on the board. Changing direction to LEFT could be an option, but maintaining the downward trajectory keeps us in line with our current progress and reduces risk.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n# SSSSS#\n#     S#\n#     H#\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nGiven that the snake is currently moving DOWN and its head is located at row 4, column 7, continuing to move DOWN appears to be the safest and most rewarding strategy. Moving DOWN from the current head position (row 4, column 7) will take the head to row 5, column 7, which is an empty space. This move maintains the current trajectory so that the snake can later reach the apple positioned at row 6, column 7 without any risk of collision with the walls or itself. Therefore, the optimal move at this epoch is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#  SSSS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#     H#\n#     A#\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nAnalysis:\nThe snake’s head is at row 4, column 6 and the snake is currently moving DOWN. Moving DOWN from (4, 6) lands in row 5, column 6 where an apple (“A”) is located. When the snake eats an apple, it grows in length – meaning the apple is removed and the head moves to the apple’s cell, while the previous head becomes a body segment (\"S\"). The rest of the snake remains intact (i.e. the tail is not removed) because the snake has grown.\n\nThus, if we choose the DOWN direction, the snake will eat the apple at row 5, column 6, increase the score by 1, and update the board accordingly.\n\nSo, the best move is to continue in the current direction, which is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#  SSSS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#     H#\n#  A AA#\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 5, column 6 and is moving DOWN. Looking at the board, if we continue moving DOWN, the snake’s head will enter the cell at row 6, column 6 where an apple (A) is located. This move will cause the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score by one and growing the snake. No collisions occur with the wall or itself, so continuing in the current direction is safe and beneficial.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#  SSSS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#A    S#\n#     S#\n#  A AH#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 6, column 6 and is currently moving DOWN. If it continued downward, it would hit the wall on row 7. Moving RIGHT would also hit the wall at column 7, and moving UP would cause the head to enter a square already occupied by its body (row 5, col6). However, if the snake turns LEFT, it will move to row 6, column 5 where there is an apple. This is a safe move that will also increase the score.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here’s the current board:\n########\n#  SSSS#\n#     S#\n#   A S#\n#A    S#\n#     S#\n#  A HS#\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is currently at row 6, column 5 and is moving LEFT. Among the legal moves (the snake can’t reverse, so RIGHT is forbidden and DOWN is not safe because it leads into the wall), continuing LEFT is a promising option since there is an apple two squares to the left (at row 6, column 3).Choosing LEFT not only safely moves the snake but also positions it closer to that apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#   SSS#\n#     S#\n#   A S#\n#A    S#\n#     S#\n#  AHSS#\n########\n\nI analyzed the board and noticed that the snake’s head is at row 7, column 5 and is currently moving LEFT. Directly to its left (row 7, column 4) is an apple ('A'). Moving left will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score. The move does not risk collision with the snake’s body or the wall, making LEFT the most advantageous choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#   SSS#\n#     S#\n#   A S#\n#AA   S#\n#     S#\n#  HSSS#\n########\n\nBased on the board and current direction (LEFT), moving LEFT leads the snake’s head from (6,3) to (6,2), which is an empty space. This move avoids collisions and keeps the snake on a safe path while progressing toward nearby apples. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Repeating the game board:\n########\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#   A S#\n#AA   S#\n#     S#\n# HSSSS#\n########\n\nI analyzed the board and noted that the snake’s head is at row 7, column 3 while the snake is currently moving LEFT. Based on the board setup, the available safe moves (not reversing direction and not colliding with the wall) are LEFT or UP (moving DOWN would hit the wall, and moving RIGHT is a direct reversal which isn’t allowed). Moving UP from (7,3) would bring the head to (6,3) – a clear cell – and would place the head closer to the two apples located at row 5 (at columns 2 and 3). Therefore, to approach an apple more directly, I choose UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","The current game board is:\n########\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#   A S#\n#AA   S#\n# H   S#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n\nI analyzed the board: The snake’s head is at row 5, column 2, and it is currently moving UP. If we move UP, the head will go from row 5 to row 4, staying in the same column (column 2). Looking at row 4 (“#AA   S#”), the cell at column 2 is an apple ('A'). Eating an apple is beneficial because it increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. The move does not lead to a collision with walls or its own body. Also, UP is allowed since reversing direction is prohibited but continuing in the same direction is perfectly fine.\n\nThus, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#   A S#\n#AH   S#\n#AS   S#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n\nBased on the board, the snake’s head is at row 4, column 2 (with the top row as row 0) and is currently heading UP. However, looking at its adjacent squares, moving LEFT from (4,2) lands on (4,1) where an apple ('A') is located. Eating this apple would increase the score while safely growing the snake. Moving RIGHT or continuing UP wouldn’t achieve this immediate benefit (and moving DOWN would cause a collision with its own body at (5,2)), so the best move is to turn LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#   A S#\n#HS  AS#\n#AS   S#\n# SSSSS#\n########\nThe snake's head is at row 4, column 1 and is currently moving LEFT. Moving LEFT from the head (4,1) would immediately hit the wall at (4,0). Changing direction to RIGHT is not allowed since it would be a reversal of the current direction. Instead, turning UP or DOWN are the only valid options. \n\nLooking at the board, moving DOWN from (4,1) takes the head to (5,1) where there is an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is beneficial because it increases the score and grows the snake, which is aligned with the goal of collecting apples. Therefore, the best move is to turn DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#   A S#\n#SSA AS#\n#HS   S#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board:\n• The snake’s head (H) is at row 5, column 1.\n• The snake’s current direction is DOWN.\n• The snake cannot reverse direction (so moving UP is forbidden) and cannot move into walls or its own body.\n• Checking the adjacent squares:\n  – LEFT from (5,1) goes to (5,0) which is a wall.\n  – RIGHT from (5,1) goes to (5,2) which is occupied by S (body).\n  – DOWN from (5,1) goes to (6,1) which is empty.\nEven though there are apples above the head, the only safe move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#     S#\n#   A S#\n#SSA AS#\n#SS   S#\n#HSSSSS#\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at (6,1) and is currently moving DOWN but moving further down would hit the wall. Likewise, moving LEFT would hit the wall as well, and UP is not allowed because it’s the forbidden reverse of the current direction. Although the cell at (6,2) (to the RIGHT) is occupied by a snake segment, in a typical snake game the tail moves forward if no apple is encountered—provided that the cell in question is actually the tail (or will be vacated by the time the head arrives). Based on the board configuration and the available moves, turning RIGHT is the only input that might ultimately result in survival and an opportunity to approach the apple (at a nearby coordinate such as (4,3)). \n\nTherefore, the best move is:\nAnswer: RIGHT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

There’s an apple immediately to its left (in the same row, one column to the left). Changing direction to LEFT is allowed (it isn’t the reverse of UP), and moving LEFT will allow the snake to eat that apple immediately.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# HS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current head position at row 4, column 2 and an apple present directly below at row 5, column 2, the optimal move is to go DOWN in order to consume the apple and increase the score, while staying consistent with the allowed moves (UP, LEFT, or DOWN) since reversing to RIGHT is forbidden.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#    A #\n# SS   #\n# H    #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the board and the positions of the apples relative to the snake's head—currently at row 5, column 2—and the fact that the snake is moving DOWN, a reversal (UP) is not allowed. Among the valid moves (\"DOWN\", \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\"), moving RIGHT positions the snake’s head at (row 5, column 3), which is a safer choice that aligns better with reaching the closest apple at (row 2, column 3). Therefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#    A #\n# S    #\n# SH   #\n#      #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board and noticed the snake’s head is at row 6, column 4, and there are two apples above: one directly above at row 3, column 4 and one at row 4, column 6. The apple at (3,4) is the most straightforward target because it is directly upward from the snake’s current position. Since the snake is currently moving RIGHT, it cannot reverse direction (i.e., it cannot go LEFT), but turning UP is allowed. Moving UP will bring the snake gradually closer to the apple, while avoiding collision with its own body or the walls. \n\nTherefore, my next move is to turn UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n# SS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nI choose to continue moving UP, as this move safely advances the snake toward the apple at (2,3) while following the movement rules. \n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#  H A #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at (row 4, column 4) and it is currently moving UP, the most promising move is to continue moving UP. Moving UP would take the head to (row 3, column 4), where an apple (“A”) is located. This move will allow the snake to eat the apple, increase the score by one, and grow in length without risking a collision with its body or the walls.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  H  A#\n#  S A #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#A     #\n########\n\nGiven the head is at (row 3, column 4) and the current direction is UP, one promising option is to steer RIGHT. Moving RIGHT will bring the snake nearer to the apple at (row 3, column 7) without colliding with any part of its body or the walls. Turning RIGHT is also allowed (since it isn’t a reversal from UP) and positions the head on a safe, open square. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  SH A#\n#  S A #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head (H) is at row 3, column 5 and it’s moving RIGHT, if it continues moving in that direction it will move into the cell at row 3, column 6, which is currently empty. This positions the snake one step closer to the apple at row 3, column 7. There is no risk of colliding with the walls or its own body in this move, and it avoids turning unnecessarily. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here's the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  SSHA#\n#  S A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nSince the snake's head is at (row 2, column 5) and it is currently moving RIGHT, moving one square to the right will bring it directly onto the apple at (row 2, column 6). This move increases the score by 1, and it is a safe and legal move that doesn’t reverse direction. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Repeating the game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  SSSH#\n#  S A #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A     #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake’s head is at the position (row 2, column 6) and the current direction is RIGHT. Moving RIGHT is not possible because it would hit the wall. Since the snake cannot reverse (i.e. move LEFT), the two available options are UP and DOWN. Moving DOWN would bring the head to (row 3, column 6) which is safe and positions the snake closer to the nearby apple located at (row 3, column 5). Choosing DOWN promises a better chance to reach an apple in the next move. Therefore, the best move is DOWN.\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  SSSS#\n#    AH#\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A     #\n########\n\nBased on the board configuration and the snake’s current direction (DOWN), the best move is to turn LEFT. This move immediately brings the snake’s head from position (3,6) to (3,5), where an apple (\"A\") is present. Eating this apple will increase the score and lengthen the snake, with no risk of hitting walls or its body. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#  SSSS#\n#   AHS#\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A     #\n########\n\nI choose to continue moving in the same direction (LEFT). Moving LEFT from the current head position (row 4, column 6) will move the snake’s head to row 4, column 5 where an apple 'A' is located. This move will result in eating the apple, thereby increasing the score and growing the snake's length. Given that this move is safe and beneficial, I choose LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#  SSSS#\n#   HSS#\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A    A#\n########\n\nConsidering the current position of the snake's head at (3,4) and its moving direction LEFT, the available moves that do not lead to collision are LEFT and DOWN (UP would move into the snake’s own body and RIGHT is not allowed because it reverses the direction). Moving LEFT keeps the snake on its current course safely without collision, while beginning to gradually shift towards the apple eventually can be achieved. Therefore, the optimal move is LEFT.\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   SSS#\n#  HSSS#\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A    A#\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head is at row 4, column 4 (if we count from 1) and the snake is currently moving LEFT, its next position will be one cell to the left of (row 4, column 4)—that is, at (row 4, column 3). That move does not hit a wall (the border is at the edges) and does not land on an apple. With no apple eaten, the snake moves forward by adding a new head in that cell and simultaneously removing the tail segment.\n\nTracing the snake’s body segments along the board (which appear in two rows) shows that if we move LEFT, then the new head at (row 4, column 3) becomes “H”, the old head (at (row 4, column 4)) turns into “S”, and the very last tail segment from the other end is removed. This move is safe and follows the rules.\n\nThus, following the game rules and the current board state, the best (and valid) move is to continue LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#    SS#\n# HSSSS#\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A    A#\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head (located on row 4, column 2) is moving left and that moving left leads it into an empty cell (row 4, column 1) while avoiding collision with its body or walls, continuing in the current LEFT direction is a safe option. It also positions the snake in a direction from which it can later maneuver toward one of the nearby apples (for example, the one at row 7, column 1). Therefore, my move is to maintain the LEFT direction.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#     S#\n#HSSSSS#\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A    A#\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s current direction is LEFT, moving forward (LEFT) is not safe because the head at (4,2) would move into the wall at (4,1). Between the two legal alternatives—UP and DOWN—moving DOWN brings the snake closer to the nearest apple (at (7,2)). Therefore, the best move is to change direction to DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#SSSSSS#\n#H     #\n#     A#\n#A    A#\n########\n\nI analyzed the board. The snake’s head is at row 5, column 2 and its current direction is DOWN. Moving straight DOWN from the head would place it at row 6, column 2, which is empty and safe. This move also positions the snake favorably to reach the apple at row 7, column 2 in the near future. Hence, the best move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#SSSSS #\n#S     #\n#H    A#\n#A    A#\n########\n\nI recommend moving DOWN. By moving the snake's head from (5,1) down to (6,1), the snake will eat the apple there, increasing its length and score, while following the current direction (DOWN) without any collisions.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#SSSSS #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#H    A#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake's head is at row 7, column 2 (if we start counting from the left with the wall at column 1). The current direction is DOWN, but moving DOWN would hit the wall (the bottom row is a boundary) and moving LEFT would run into the left wall. Therefore, among the allowed directions (RIGHT or DOWN or LEFT—with UP being disallowed as the snake cannot reverse) the safe move is to turn RIGHT. This move keeps the snake safely on the board and sets up potential for approaching an apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#SH   A#\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 7 column 3 and is currently moving RIGHT. Moving RIGHT from (7,3) will take the snake to (7,4), which is safe and steadily guides it toward the apple at (7,7). Thus, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#SSS   #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#SSH  A#\n########\nBased on the current board, the snake’s head is at row 6, column 3 and it is moving RIGHT. Moving RIGHT brings the head from (6,3) to (6,4), which is an empty cell and safely continues toward the apple at (6,6). Turning UP might also be safe, but it does not immediately work toward an apple, and moving DOWN would hit the wall. Also, reversing direction (LEFT) is not permitted. Therefore, the optimal move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#SS    #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#SSSH A#\n########\nI analyzed the board with the snake’s head currently at position (6,4) and the snake moving RIGHT. Looking at the available moves (the snake can’t reverse direction so LEFT is off limits, and DOWN would hit a wall) the only safe moves are UP or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT leads the snake safely into an empty space at (6,5), and it sets up the opportunity to reach the apple at (6,6) in a subsequent move. Thus, the optimal direction is to continue RIGHT.\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#SSSSHA#\n########\n\nContinuing in the current direction (RIGHT) will bring the snake's head from position (7,6) to (7,7) where there is an apple. This move is valid and will allow the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score by one and growing in length. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board as provided:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#S     #\n#S  A  #\n#S    A#\n#SSSSSH#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board with the snake currently moving RIGHT: the snake’s head is at row 6, column 6. Moving RIGHT would lead into the wall (column 7 in row 6 is a wall), and turning LEFT is not allowed because that is directly reversing the current direction and it would move into its own body. Moving DOWN would also hit the wall (row 7 is entirely walls). The only safe move is UP. Moving UP from row 6, column 6 would bring the head to row 5, column 6 where there is an apple, which is a beneficial move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#S  A  #\n#S  A  #\n#S    H#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 5, column 6 and it is currently moving UP. The available moves (without reversing to DOWN or running into the walls) are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT isn’t an option because it leads directly to the wall. Although continuing UP (taking the head to row 4, column 6) is a safe move, the apples lie to the left (one at position [4,4] and another at [3,4]). By choosing LEFT, the snake moves from (5,6) to (5,5) which brings it closer to the nearest apples. Thus, turning LEFT is the best decision to help steer the snake toward an apple and eventually grow in length.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","The current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#S  A  #\n#S   HS#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 6, column 6 and its current moving direction is LEFT. The nearby apples are located at row 2, col6; row 4, col5; and row 5, col5 with the closest apple being at row 5, col5. From the current head position (6,6) the apple at (5,5) is one step upward and one step to the left.\n\nSince the snake is already moving LEFT, one safe option is to keep moving LEFT to reach open space (cell (6,5) is empty). By moving LEFT, the snake stays in a safe area and later can turn upward to approach and eventually eat the apple at (5,5).\n\nTherefore, following the rules and considering safety and the approach toward the apple, the best move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#   A  #\n#S  HSS#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 5, column 4 and the current direction is LEFT. There are three apples on the board: one at row 1, column 5; one at row 3, column 4; and one at row 4, column 4. The closest apple is at row 4, column 4 which is directly above the head. Moving UP from the current head position will immediately let the snake eat this apple, increasing the score. Since turning UP from LEFT is a valid move (and it is not the reverse of LEFT), the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here’s the current game board repeated exactly as provided:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#   H A#\n#S  SSS#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is located at row 4, column 4. Its current movement direction is UP and the allowed moves (since the snake cannot directly reverse) are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP will position the head at (3,4), where there is an apple. Collecting an apple increases the score and extends the snake’s length without any risk of immediate collision. Therefore, the optimal move is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n# A H  #\n#   S A#\n#S  SSS#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is UP and analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 3, column 4. There is an apple at (3,2) which is only two spaces to the left of the head. By choosing LEFT this turn, the snake will move from (3,4) to (3,3), which is safe and positions it closer to that nearby apple. This move does not reverse the current direction, and on the following moves the snake can continue toward the apple to increase the score. Therefore, the optimal move now is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n# AHS  #\n#   S A#\n#   SSS#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nBased on the board, the snake’s head is at row 3, column 3 and is moving LEFT. If it continues moving left, it will immediately move into the cell at row 3, column 2, which contains an apple ('A'). This allows the snake to eat the apple, gain a score point, and grow without risking a collision. Therefore, the optimal move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n# HSS  #\n#   S A#\n#  ASSS#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 3, column 2 and is currently moving LEFT. The valid moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed). The immediate square to the left (row 3, column 1) is empty, but moving DOWN to (row 4, column 2) brings the snake closer to an apple (specifically the apple at row 5, column 3) with a smaller Manhattan distance. Thus, to approach an apple while remaining safe, the best move is to turn DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n# H S A#\n#  ASSS#\n# SSSSS#\n########\nI choose to continue moving DOWN. This move keeps the snake on a safe path while positioning it close to the apple at (5,3), which can be collected on the following move. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n# S S A#\n# HASSS#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nThe best move is to go RIGHT. Moving RIGHT from the head at (5,2) will immediately put the snake onto the apple at (5,3), increasing the score and growing the snake. This move is legal since the snake is currently moving DOWN and can turn RIGHT without reversing its direction.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n# S S A#\n# SHSSS#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at position (5,3) moving RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would lead the head into (5,4), which is already occupied by its body (\"S\"), causing a collision. Similarly, moving DOWN sends the head to (6,3), another body cell. The only safe and viable move is UP, which moves the head to (4,3) – an empty space that avoids collision. Therefore, the best direction choice is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n# SHS A#\n# SSSSS#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head (H) is at row 5, column 4 and the current direction is UP. Its adjacent cells in the allowed directions (UP, LEFT, and RIGHT – noting that reversing to DOWN is not allowed) are:\n • UP: cell (row 4, col 4),\n • LEFT: cell (row 5, col 3),\n • RIGHT: cell (row 5, col 5).\n\nHowever, all these cells are currently occupied by part of the snake’s body (S). In a typical snake move the tail cell is removed unless an apple is eaten, making it sometimes safe for the head to move into the tail. Yet none of these occupied neighbors is the tail cell (which is farther along the snake’s body, likely at the bottom‐right end). Therefore, whichever direction we choose (UP, LEFT, or RIGHT) the new head position would intersect with a body segment that is not going to be cleared this move and would result in immediate collision.\n\nSince there is no move that avoids collision, the best (and only valid) option is to continue in the current direction.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls.

This move immediately positions the snake onto an apple, increasing the score and growing its length.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#AHS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nI choose to continue with the current direction. Moving LEFT from the snake’s head at row 4, column 2 places it into the apple at row 4, column 1, where it will eat the apple and grow in length.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#HSS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at row5, column2 and the snake is currently moving LEFT, moving left would immediately hit the wall. Also, the snake cannot choose RIGHT because that would be a direct reversal. Moving DOWN would take the head to row6, column2, which is safe but does not help approach any apple. On the other hand, moving UP takes the head to row4, column2, which is a safe move and helps steer the snake towards the apple at row2, column2. Therefore, the best decision is to move UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#H  A  #\n#SS    #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake's head is at row 4 (\"#H  A  #\") and is moving UP. The most straightforward way to approach an apple is by continuing in the UP direction toward the apple at row 2, col1 (which is in line with the apple at row 1, col1). Moving UP is safe since the next position (row 2, col1) is empty and keeps us heading toward the closest apple. It also follows the rule that the snake cannot reverse direction.\n\nAnswer: UP","Repeating the current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#H     #\n#S  A  #\n#S     #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is UP, moving UP will take the snake's head from its current position (row 3, column 2) directly into the cell in row 2, column 2 where an apple ('A') is located. Eating the apple will increase the score and grow the snake without risking a collision with the walls or its own body. Therefore, the best move in this situation is to continue heading UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#S  A  #\n#S     #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nGiven that the snake is currently moving UP but moving UP would take the snake into the wall (row 0), and turning LEFT would also collide with the wall (column 0), the only safe and legal move is to turn RIGHT. \n\nThus, my answer is:\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SH    #\n#S     #\n#S  A  #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 1, column 2 and it is currently moving RIGHT. The available safe moves (avoiding reversing direction or hitting walls) are to continue RIGHT or change to DOWN (or UP, but UP would hit the wall). There is an apple at row 5, column 2 which is directly aligned with the snake’s column if it moves downward. By changing the direction to DOWN, the snake will eventually be able to reach that apple in a direct path without risk of self-collision. Therefore, the best decision here is to issue the command DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","The current game board is:\n########\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 3, column 3 (inside the walls) and the snake is currently moving DOWN. There are three apples on the board. In particular, one apple is located on row 4 (in the “A” cell in \"#   A  #\"), which is reasonably close to the head. Although moving DOWN from (3,3) would be a safe option (moving to (4,3)), choosing RIGHT will position the head at (3,4) and orient it more toward the apple on row 4, column 5. Since the snake cannot reverse (so LEFT is not allowed because it would hit its own body) and UP is the direct reverse relative to the current direction, the best options are either pressing DOWN or turning RIGHT. With RIGHT the snake would have a clear path to eventually maneuver to the apple by possibly turning DOWN next.\n\nThus, considering immediate progress toward an apple and safe movement, the selected move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","The current game board is:\n########\n#SS    #\n# SH   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nConsidering the snake’s head is at row 3, column 4 (using 1-indexed rows\/columns with walls) and the current direction is RIGHT, we have options of continuing RIGHT, or changing to UP or DOWN (we cannot reverse to LEFT). Moving RIGHT will take the snake to an open cell (row 2, col 4 in 0-indexed notation) safely. This move keeps the snake moving in a steady direction and positions it well to reach the apple in the near future (the apple at row 4, column 5 is nearby when considered in subsequent moves). There are no immediate obstacles in that direction.\n\nThus, the best decision for this move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Repeating the current game board:\n########\n# S    #\n# SSH  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is currently at row 3, column 5 (H) and moving RIGHT. Looking at the potential moves:\n• Moving RIGHT goes to (3,6), which is empty.\n• Moving UP goes to (2,5), which is also empty.\n• Moving DOWN goes to (4,5) where there is an apple (A).\n\nSince moving DOWN will let the snake immediately collect an apple, increasing the score and growing its length, the best action is to move DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Repeating the current game board:\n########\n# S    #\n# SSS  #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nGiven the snake’s head is at (row3, col4) and moving in the current DOWN direction would place the head at (row4, col4) (an empty space), this is a safe move. Moreover, one of the apples is located at (row5, col4), so continuing DOWN positions the snake to eat that apple on the following move, making this direction appealing.\n\nThus, I choose to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n#   S  #\n#   H  #\n# A A  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nSince the snake’s current direction is DOWN and moving DOWN will land the head on the cell at row 6, column 5 where there is an apple, this move is optimal. By going DOWN the snake will eat the apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing in length, while staying safe from any collisions.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#AA H  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the head is at (5,4) and the available apples are mostly to its left (at positions (5,1) and (5,2)). Since the snake’s current direction is DOWN, a reversal is forbidden (i.e. UP is not allowed). However, we can choose to go LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. Moving LEFT from (5,4) leads to (5,3), which is an empty space that places the snake a step closer to the apple cluster. Thus, the best move is to change direction to LEFT.\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the repeating of the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#AAHS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving LEFT and the cell immediately to the left of its head at (5,3) is (5,2) which contains an apple, the best move is to continue moving LEFT. By moving LEFT, the snake will eat the apple at (5,2), grow by one segment (its previous head becomes a body segment), and increase the score by one. This move is both legal (no reversing direction) and beneficial.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#A  S  #\n#   S  #\n#AHSS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nBased on the current direction (LEFT) and the board layout, the snake's head at row6, col3 moving LEFT would go to row6, col2. That cell contains an apple ('A'), so this move will allow the snake to eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and grow its length. This is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#A  S  #\n#A  S  #\n#HSSS  #\n#     A#\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, I noticed that moving LEFT (the current direction) would immediately hit the wall, which is not allowed. Moving DOWN would put the snake into an empty space, but moving UP will lead to the position containing an apple (in row 5, column 1) and therefore increase the score. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction and the best option, therefore, is to turn UP and take the apple, I choose UP.\nAnswer: UP","Here's the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  SS A#\n#A  S  #\n#H  S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is located at row 4, column 1 and is currently moving UP. If we continue moving UP from (4,1), the snake will move into row 3, column 1 where an apple ('A') is located, allowing the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1. Since moving UP directly is both a legal move (the snake cannot reverse direction, but continuing UP is allowed) and brings immediate benefit, the best direction to choose is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#  SS A#\n#H  SA #\n#S  S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAfter reviewing the board, the snake’s head is at row 4 (the second character of \"#H  SA #\") and the current movement is UP. Moving UP from (row 4, column 1) puts the head into an empty space in row 3 (specifically in \"#  SS A#\"), ensuring safety for this epoch. Among the allowed moves, turning RIGHT might eventually lead toward the apple at (row 4, col 5) but it also risks a collision with the snake’s own body. Therefore, the safe and immediate option is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#H  S A#\n#S  SA #\n#S  S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row2, column1 and is currently moving UP. The legal moves (without reversing direction) are to continue moving UP or to turn RIGHT. Moving UP would take the snake to row1, column1—which is safe—but moving RIGHT brings the head closer to the apple at row2, column6. Given that the snake’s body is mostly to the left and below the head, turning RIGHT provides a healthier path toward an apple while keeping safety in mind.\n\nThus, the recommended direction is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#SH   A#\n#S  SA #\n#S  S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 2, column 2 and is currently moving RIGHT. If the snake continues moving RIGHT it will enter an empty space at (2,3) and eventually reach the apple at (2,6) along the same row without colliding with any part of its body or the walls. Turning UP or DOWN at this moment does not provide a clear path to an apple and may complicate the route. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#SSH  A#\n#S   A #\n#S  S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAnalysis:\nThe snake's head is currently at row 2, column 3 and is moving to the RIGHT. Checking the cell immediately to the RIGHT (row 2, column 4) shows an empty space (a blank). Although there are apples on the board (one at row 2, column 6; another at row 3, column 5; and one at row 6, column 6), moving RIGHT will advance the head toward the apple at row 2, column 6. Additionally, this move is safe as it does not immediately cause a collision with the wall or the snake’s body, and it adheres to the game rule of not reversing direction.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#SSSH A#\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#SSSS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nBased on the current board configuration and the fact that the snake's head (H) is at the right end of its body in row 3 and there is an apple two spaces to its right, continuing in the current direction (RIGHT) seems like the optimal move. Moving RIGHT will allow the snake to first move into an empty square and, on the subsequent move, reach the apple, increase its score, and grow without colliding with the body or walls.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Reproducing the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#SSSSHA#\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#SSS   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board:\n• The snake’s head (H) is at row2, column5. The snake’s current direction is RIGHT.\n• One cell to the RIGHT of the head is row2, column6, which contains an apple (A).\n• Moving RIGHT into an apple will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1.\n• There is no collision risk in that cell, and the move does not reverse the current direction.\n\nThus, moving RIGHT is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#SSSSSH#\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#SSS   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nConsidering the current direction is RIGHT, moving straight would cause a collision with the wall. Also, reversing directly to LEFT is prohibited. Thus, the snake must turn either UP or DOWN. By turning DOWN, the snake advances to position (4,7) where the square is empty and it positions itself adjacently to the apple at (4,6) on the next move. This provides a strategic advantage to quickly reach the apple and grow in length. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#SSSSSS#\n#S   AH#\n#S     #\n#SS    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 4, column 7 and the snake is currently moving DOWN. Notice that to the left of the head (row 4, column 6) there is an apple. Changing direction to LEFT from the current DOWN direction is allowed (it’s not a direct reverse) and will allow the snake to immediately eat the apple, gaining a point and increasing its length.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A     #\n#SSSSSS#\n#S   HS#\n#S  A  #\n#SS    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nI'll choose to continue in the current LEFT direction. Moving left from the head's current position at (row3, col5) will move the head to (row3, col4), which is an empty space. This move is safe and positions the snake close to the apple at (row4, col4), making it accessible in the near future while avoiding collision with its body. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A     #\n#SSSSSS#\n#S  HSS#\n#S  A  #\n#S     #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake's head is located at row 4, column 5 and is currently moving LEFT. The available moves (other than LEFT) are UP and DOWN (since a reverse to RIGHT is not allowed, and UP would collide with its own body at row 3, column 5). Moving DOWN from (4,5) goes to row 5, column 5, where there is an apple. Eating that apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake, making DOWN the best move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#AA    #\n#SSSSSS#\n#S  SSS#\n#S  H  #\n#S     #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake's head is at row 4, column 4 and moving downward. The nearest apple appears to be at row 6, column 6, and continuing in the current \"DOWN\" direction safely moves the snake to (5, 4) – a clear and viable cell. Since continuing in the same direction does not present an immediate hazard and also keeps the snake in a good position for later maneuvers toward the apple, the best decision is to keep moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n#AA    #\n#SSSSSS#\n#S  SSS#\n#S  S  #\n#   H  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nLooking at the snake’s head at row 5, column 4 (with the top row as row 0) and considering that the current movement direction is DOWN, the next square in that direction is row 6, column 4. This square is empty, meaning no immediate collision with any snake body or wall. It also positions the snake a bit closer to the apple in row 6 at column 6. Since turning left (to (5,3)) or right (to (5,5)) would move the snake away from that nearby apple and the board’s safe area is open in this direction, the optimal strategy is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#AA    #\n#SSSSSS#\n#S  SSS#\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#   H A#\n########\n\nThe current head is at row 6, column 4 and it’s moving DOWN, but continuing DOWN would immediately hit the wall. Since the snake cannot reverse direction (i.e., UP is disallowed) the only options are LEFT or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT puts the head at (6,5) and on the following move (if we continue RIGHT) it will land on (6,6), where an apple is located. This move is optimal because it leads directly to an apple and increases the score. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#AA    #\n#SSSSSS#\n#   SSS#\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#   SHA#\n########\n\nConsidering the snake’s current direction is RIGHT and its head is at (row6, col5), moving RIGHT will lead it to (row6, col6) where there is an apple ('A'). This move will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1. Since turning LEFT is not allowed (as it would be a reversal) and UP or DOWN do not offer the immediate benefit of eating an apple, the optimal move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#AA A  #\n#SSSSSS#\n#   SSS#\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#   SSH#\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is currently at row 6, column 6 and the snake is moving RIGHT, continuing that way would immediately crash into the wall (as column 7 is a wall). Moving DOWN would also lead into the wall (row 7 is entirely walls). The only viable option is to move UP, which moves the head from row6, col6 to row5, col6—a safe and open space. \n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#AA A  #\n# SSSSS#\n#   SSS#\n#   S  #\n#   S H#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nBased on the current board and position of the snake’s head at (5,6) moving UP—with three apples positioned in row 1—the best move is to continue in the UP direction.

In a standard Snake game move (when no apple is eaten) the snake’s tail is removed at the same time the head is advanced. This means it is safe to move into a square that is currently occupied by the tail, provided that square is indeed the tail cell that will soon be freed. In the current configuration the snake’s body forms a nearly complete block, and although all immediate adjacent cells (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN) are occupied by segments, the snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid because the snake is moving DOWN). \n\nBetween the remaining directions (LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN), choosing LEFT appears to be the best option for trying to maneuver out of the confined “block” and eventually head toward the apples on the upper part of the board.

Notice that there’s an apple immediately to the right (in row 5, column 5) – turning RIGHT will let the snake eat the apple and gain a point. Therefore, the best move is to change direction to RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#  SH  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head is at row 4, column 4 and the current moving direction is RIGHT, we cannot directly reverse to LEFT. Noticing there is an apple at row 2, column 4 (directly above the head if we look vertically), it makes sense to change direction to UP in order to move towards eating that apple. Therefore, the best move is to steer UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A  H  #\n#   S  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the snake’s current direction is UP and the head is at row 3, column 4, moving UP will take the snake to row 2, column 4 where an apple is located. Eating this apple is optimal because it increases the score and causes the snake to grow, with no risk of collision. Therefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n# A H  #\n#A  S  #\n#   S  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the board, the snake’s head is at row 2, column 4 and the closest apple is at row 2, column 2. Since the snake is currently moving UP and cannot reverse (i.e. it cannot turn DOWN directly), the best option is to steer LEFT so that the snake gradually moves toward the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n# AHS  #\n#A  S  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nI choose to move LEFT since the snake’s head at row 3, column 4 will reach the apple at row 3, column 3, allowing it to eat the apple, grow longer, and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n# HSS  #\n#A  S  #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at (row 2, column 2) and its current movement is LEFT, we must choose a direction that does not reverse the movement (i.e. we can choose LEFT, UP, or DOWN). Moving left advances the head from (2,2) to (2,1) – a safe and open cell. Although there isn’t an apple immediately at (2,1), continuing in the left direction keeps the snake safe and sets up an opportunity to steer toward the nearby apple at (row 3, column 1) in a future move. Therefore, I choose to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#HSSS  #\n#A     #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 2, column 1 and is currently moving LEFT. If it kept going LEFT, it would hit the wall because the cell to its left (row 2, column 0) is a wall. Instead, the best move is to change direction to DOWN. Moving DOWN from (2,1) will take the snake’s head to row 3, column 1 where an apple is located. Eating the apple will increase the score and the snake will grow longer, making this the optimal move.\n\nAfter executing the DOWN move, the snake’s head moves to (3,1), eating the apple there. The head (H) now appears on row 3, column 1, and the previous head at (2,1) becomes part of the snake’s body (S). The rest of the snake’s body remains at its old positions, and the apple at (3,1) is removed from the board. All other cells remain unchanged.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","The current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#SSSS  #\n#H     #\n#A  A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 3, column 1, and it is currently moving DOWN. The square directly below the head (row 4, column 1) contains an apple. Moving DOWN will result in the snake eating that apple, increasing the score and growing in length without any collision issues.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#SSSS  #\n#S   A #\n#H  A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake's head is at row 5, column 2 (between the walls), and it is currently moving in the DOWN direction. Notice that directly below the head in row 6, column 2, there is an apple ('A'). Moving DOWN will allow the snake to eat that apple, increasing the score and growing its length without any risk of colliding with any walls or its own body. Therefore, the optimal move in this situation is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","The current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#SSSS  #\n#S   A #\n#S  A  #\n#H A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at row 6, column 2 and the current moving direction is DOWN, we have three valid choices (DOWN, RIGHT, or LEFT). However, a LEFT move would put the snake into the wall because column 1 is a wall, and continuing DOWN would lead the snake away from the nearby apple at (6,4). By turning RIGHT, the snake will move to (6,3) which sets it on course to reach the apple at (6,4) in the subsequent move. This increases our chances to score and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#SSS   #\n#S   A #\n#S  A  #\n#SHA   #\n#      #\n########\n\nMoving RIGHT is the best move here. The snake’s head at position (row 5, column 2) will move to (row 5, column 3), which contains an apple. Eating this apple will increase the score by one, and since the move is legal in the current direction (RIGHT), it is both safe and beneficial.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#SSS   #\n#S  AA #\n#S  A  #\n#SSH   #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 5, column 3 and it is currently moving RIGHT. There is an apple at (4,4) which is the closest one to the head. Although moving RIGHT would still keep the snake safe, turning UP positions the head at (4,3) which directly sets up for eating the apple in the next move by moving RIGHT. Since reversing is not allowed and both RIGHT and UP are valid turns, choosing UP seems optimal for approaching the apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#SS    #\n#S  AA #\n#S HA  #\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board:\n• The snake’s head (H) is at row 5, column 3.\n• The current direction is UP.\n• The cell immediately above (row 4, column 3) is empty.\n• However, turning RIGHT would move the head to row 5, column 4 where there is an apple (A), which will increase the score and grow the snake.\n\nSince eating an apple is beneficial, I choose to turn RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#SS    #\n#S  AA #\n#S SH  #\n#SSS   #\n#   A  #\n########\nI choose to move UP since it will immediately take the snake's head from (4,4) to (3,4) where an apple is located, increasing the score and safely growing the snake without risk of collision.\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#SS    #\n#S  HA #\n#SASS  #\n#SSS   #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nConsidering the head is at row 3, column 4 and the snake is moving UP, the allowed directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT moves the head to row 3, column 5 where an apple is located. Eating that apple will increase the score and grow the snake. Therefore, the optimal move is RIGHT.\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#SS    #\n#S  SH #\n#SASS  #\n#SSS   #\n#  AA  #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 3, column 5 and moving in the RIGHT direction. The adjacent cell to the right (row 3, column 6) is empty and safe. This move preserves the current safe heading while avoiding an immediate collision, and it keeps options open to eventually reach one of the apples on the board. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#S     #\n#S  SSH#\n#SASS  #\n#SSS   #\n#  AA  #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is currently at row 4, column 7 and is moving RIGHT. Continuing RIGHT would immediately hit the wall (at column 8), so that isn’t an option. Since the snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT is disallowed), our remaining options are UP and DOWN. \n\nMoving UP would take the head to row 3, column 7, which is safe but does not progress towards the nearby apples. Moving DOWN places the head at row 5, column 7. This is also safe and steers the snake closer to the apples on row 7. Therefore, choosing DOWN is the best move to survive and work towards collecting more apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#S  SSS#\n#SASS H#\n#SSS   #\n#  AA  #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head (H) is at row 4, column 6 and it is currently moving DOWN. Moving RIGHT is immediately blocked by the wall, and moving UP would cause the snake to collide with its own body (at row 3, column 6). That leaves DOWN and LEFT as safe options.\n\nIf we continue moving DOWN, the head would advance to row 5, column 6, which is safe but does nothing to immediately approach any apple. Alternatively, by turning LEFT, the head moves to row 4, column 5—a safe move that brings the snake closer to the apple located at row 4, column 2. This makes LEFT a more strategic choice to get an apple soon and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSS#\n#SASSHS#\n#SSS   #\n#  AA  #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake's head is at row 4, column 5 and is currently moving LEFT. Moving LEFT would move the head to (4,4), which is occupied by its body. Moving UP would take the head to (3,5), but that cell is also occupied by the snake’s body. The only viable move without an immediate collision is DOWN, which moves the head from (4,5) to (5,5) — an empty cell. Therefore, the best and safe move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSS#\n# ASSSS#\n#SSS H #\n#  AA  #\n########\nI analyzed the board and noticed that the snake’s head is at row 5, column 5 while the nearest apple (one of them) is located at row 6, column 4.

Continuing in the current DOWN direction would result in a collision with the wall, and reversing direction is not allowed. Therefore, the optimal move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current Game Board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSS#\n# ASSSS#\n# SSAS #\n#  AHS #\n########\n\nBased on the board, the snake’s head at row 6, column 4 is immediately adjacent on its left (row 6, column 3) to an apple.

Checking the adjacent squares:\n• Moving LEFT would take the head to (6,2), which is empty.\n• Moving UP would lead to (5,3), which is occupied by the snake’s body.\n• Moving DOWN would hit the wall.\nAdditionally, the snake cannot reverse direction (i.e., going RIGHT is prohibited as it’s the opposite of LEFT). Therefore, the only valid move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#   SSS#\n# ASSSS#\n#  SAS #\n# HSSS #\n########\n\nBased on the board analysis, the snake's head is at (6,2) and its current direction is LEFT. Moving DOWN is not an option because it immediately hits the wall, and turning RIGHT would mean an illegal direct reversal. Looking at the board, there is an apple at (4,2) directly above the head (after moving UP from (6,2) to (5,2)). Moving UP brings the snake closer to that apple, while moving LEFT (to (6,1)) does not lead directly to an apple. Therefore, the best move is to change direction upward.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here’s the current board you provided:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#   SSS#\n# ASSSS#\n# H AS #\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nObserving the board, the snake’s head (H) is at row5, column2 and it’s currently moving UP. Directly above the head is row4, column2 which contains an apple (A). Moving UP will therefore allow the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score by one and safely growing the snake’s body. Since this move is valid and beneficial, the best decision is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#   SSS#\n# HSSSS#\n# S AS #\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nBased on the board and the current direction (UP), the snake’s head is at row 5, column 3. Moving UP will take the head into row 4, column 3, which is unoccupied and lies in the path toward one of the apples (for instance, the apple at row 2, column 3). A LEFT turn would also be possible, but it wouldn’t bring the snake any closer to an apple. Turning RIGHT from UP would result in a collision with its body (since the snake occupies row 5, column 4). Therefore, the best option is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n# H SSS#\n# S SSS#\n# S AS #\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is currently at (3,2) and moving UP would put it at (2,2) (an empty cell), this move safely advances the snake without an immediate collision. From (2,2) the snake will be one step away from either the apple at (2,3) or the apple at (1,2) on subsequent moves, increasing the chance to grab an apple with minimal risk. Changing direction to LEFT or RIGHT now would not yield any direct advantage but could bring the snake dangerously close to its own body, especially considering the cluster of snake segments mostly on the right. Therefore, continuing with the current upward motion appears to be the safest and most strategic move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# A    #\n# HA   #\n# S SSS#\n# S  SS#\n# S AS #\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, our snake’s head (marked H) is at the third row, second column (inside the walls).

Since moving UP would immediately allow the snake to eat that apple, increase the score, and grow in length without colliding with a wall or itself, the best move here is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","The current game board is:\n########\n# H    #\n# SA   #\n# S SSS#\n# S ASS#\n# S AS #\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the situation:\n• The snake’s head is at position (1,2) and is currently moving UP.\n• Moving UP would take the head into the top wall (row 0), which is not allowed.\n• Reversing direction (DOWN) is disallowed.\n• That leaves LEFT and RIGHT as the only options.\n• Looking at nearby apples:\n – There’s an apple at (2,3), which is the closest target.\n• Moving RIGHT from (1,2) takes the snake to (1,3), setting up a clear path to turn DOWN in the next move and reach the apple at (2,3).\n• In contrast, choosing LEFT would move the head to (1,1), and would not be as direct in guiding the snake toward an apple.\n  \nTherefore, the best move is to go RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n# SH   #\n# SA   #\n# S  SS#\n# S ASS#\n# S AS #\n# SSSS #\n########\nConsidering the snake's head is at (1,3) and the current direction is RIGHT, the best option is to change direction DOWN. This move will send the snake's head to (2,3), where an apple is located. Eating this apple is desirable because it will increase the score and extend the snake's length. Therefore, the chosen direction is DOWN.\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# SS   #\n# SH   #\n# SA SS#\n# S ASS#\n# S AS #\n# SSSS #\n########\nI choose to move DOWN to eat the apple at (row 3, column 3). Since the snake is currently moving DOWN and the forward cell contains an apple, moving DOWN will immediately increase the score and grow the snake without risk of collision.\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# SS   #\n# SS   #\n# SH SS#\n# S ASS#\n#AS AS #\n# SSSS #\n########\nI will choose to keep moving DOWN. Moving down from the snake’s head at (4,4) places it at (5,4), which is free and positions the snake closer to the apple present at (5,5). Also, turning left would lead to collision with its own body, and reversing direction is not allowed. So the best move is to continue DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# SS   #\n# SS   #\n# SS  S#\n# SHASS#\n#AS AS #\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nBased on the current board, the snake’s head is located at row 5, column 4 and the current moving direction is DOWN. Moving RIGHT from the head’s position leads to row 5, column 5 which contains an apple (‘A’). Since eating an apple increases the score and the snake grows, and because turning RIGHT is allowed (it is not the reverse of DOWN), the optimal move is to change direction to RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n# SS   #\n# SSA  #\n# SS  S#\n# SSHSS#\n#AS AS #\n# SSSS #\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head (at row 5, column 5) is currently moving right, but moving right would immediately lead it into its own body. The only valid moves besides the forbidden left (reverse) are UP and DOWN. Moving UP would take the head to row 4, column 5 – a safe empty space – but moving DOWN from (5, 5) leads to row 6, column 5 where an apple ('A') is located. Since eating an apple is beneficial (increasing the score and growing the snake), the optimal move is to turn DOWN.\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n# SS   #\n# SSA A#\n# SS  S#\n# SSSSS#\n#AS HS #\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board with the snake’s head at row 5, column 4 and the current direction being DOWN, we check possible moves. Moving DOWN would take the head to row 6, column 4, but that cell is occupied by a snake body part, which would lead to a collision. Moving RIGHT would take the head to row 5, column 5, which is also occupied by a snake body segment. The only safe move is to turn LEFT, which takes the head from (5,4) to (5,3), an empty space that avoids immediate collision. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board as provided:\n########\n# SS   #\n# SSA A#\n# SS   #\n# SSSSS#\n#ASHSS #\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nLooking closely at the situation, the snake’s head is at row 6, column 4 and is currently moving LEFT. Its immediately adjacent squares are:\n • LEFT: (6,3) contains an S,\n • UP: (5,4) contains an S,\n • DOWN: (7,4) contains an S.\nBecause the snake moves by adding a new head cell and (unless it eats an apple) then removing its tail, the only “safe” move into a body cell is if that cell is exactly where the tail is located. After analyzing the snake’s chain, it appears that the only tail candidate (with only one adjacent snake segment) is at (5,7) – which is not one of the adjacent squares to the head.\n\nThus, none of the allowed moves (LEFT, UP, or DOWN – note that RIGHT is forbidden because it is a reversal) would lead into what is currently the tail cell. In this trapped situation no move avoids collision. \n\nSince the snake is essentially locked in with no safe alternative, the best available (or rather, inevitable) choice is to continue in the current direction, LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

By moving UP, the snake will eat the apple at (3,3), grow in length (the current head becomes a body piece) and increase the score by 1. This follows the game rules just like in the provided example.\n\nThus, my move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#  H   #\n#  S A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nI decide to move UP. This continues in the current direction, bringing the head from (4,4) to (3,4) and getting the snake closer to the apple at (3,3) in the next move. Staying in the UP direction is safe and follows the rules.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nI choose to move LEFT, because by turning left the snake's head moves from (2,3) to (2,2) where there is an apple. This move will allow the snake to immediately eat the apple, increase the score and grow in length, while following the allowed direction changes from the current UP movement.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n# HS   #\n#  S   #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nConsidering the situation, the snake’s head is at position (2,2) and the apple nearest to it is at (1,5). Moving UP from (2,2) puts the head at (1,2), reducing the Manhattan distance (from 4 down to 3) toward that apple. This move is allowed since the snake’s current direction is LEFT and UP is not a reversal. Therefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n# H  A #\n# SS   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 1, column 2 and it’s currently moving UP. However, moving UP would bring the head into the wall (row 0, column 2) and end the game. Moving LEFT is safe, but the apple at row 1, column 5 is closer on the right. By turning RIGHT, the snake moves to row 1, column 3, safely advancing toward the nearby apple. Therefore, the best direction is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n# SH A #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nI choose to continue in the current direction (RIGHT). Moving RIGHT brings the head from (2,4) to (2,5), which is safe and puts the snake one step closer to the apple at (2,6).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n# SSHA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nI see that the snake’s head (H) is at row 2, column 5 (using 1-indexed rows and columns with the walls as boundaries) and it is moving RIGHT. Directly in front (to its RIGHT) is an apple (“A”). Eating this apple will increase your score and grow the snake. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# SSSH #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 1, column 5 and is moving RIGHT. Moving UP would hit the top wall, and moving RIGHT would only move into an empty cell. However, moving DOWN takes the snake to row 2, column 5 where there is an apple. Since eating an apple increases the score and the snake’s length, the best move is to go DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# SSSS #\n#    H #\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nGiven the current snake head position at row 2, column 5 and the apple directly below at row 4, column 5 (with one safe step in between at row 3, column 5), it makes sense to continue moving in the same direction (DOWN) so that on the subsequent move the snake can consume the apple. Therefore, my answer is DOWN.\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#  SSS #\n#    S #\n#A   H #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nGiven the snake's current position at (4,6) and moving DOWN, moving DOWN will take the snake's head to (5,6) where an apple is located. This move lets the snake eat an apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1 while avoiding any collisions. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#  SSS #\n#    S #\n#A   S #\n#    H #\n#A     #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the head is at row 5, column 5 and the current direction is DOWN. By moving DOWN, the snake’s head will advance to row 6, column 5 which is an empty cell. This move keeps the snake safe and maintains its current trajectory. Continuing in the DOWN direction should eventually allow maneuvering toward the apples, such as the one at row 7, column 4, without risking an immediate collision with either the walls or its own body.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","The current game board is:\n########\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#A   S #\n#    S #\n#A   H #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head is currently at row 5, column 5 and the snake is moving DOWN, moving in the same direction (DOWN) will move the head to row 6, column 5, which is a safe empty space. This move also keeps our options open to eventually approach the nearby apple at (6,4) by turning left later. Therefore, the choice is to continue moving in the DOWN direction.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#A   S #\n#    S #\n#A   S #\n#   AH #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at (6,5) and is currently moving DOWN. Moving DOWN would make the snake hit the wall at row 7, so that move is not viable. Turning LEFT from the current head position moves the snake from (6,5) to (6,4), which contains an apple. This move both avoids collision with the wall and allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score. Therefore, the best move is LEFT.\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    S #\n#  A S #\n#A   S #\n#    S #\n#A   S #\n#   HS #\n########\n\nI choose UP as the next direction so the snake can start moving towards one of the nearby apples.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#  A S #\n#A   S #\n#    S #\n#A  HS #\n#   SS #\n########\nI'm choosing to go LEFT so the snake can approach the apple at (6,2) more quickly.\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#A   S #\n#    S #\n#A HSS #\n#   SS #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at row 5, column 3 and is currently moving LEFT, the best move is to continue moving LEFT. This move will take the head to cell (5,2) which is empty, keeping the snake safe while heading toward the apple located at (5,1) in subsequent move(s). Since the snake cannot reverse its direction and there is no immediate danger in proceeding with the current direction (LEFT), our recommended move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#A     #\n#    S #\n#AHSSS #\n#   SS #\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head is currently moving LEFT and the square immediately to its left (row 6, column 1) contains an apple, moving LEFT will immediately help gain a point and safely grow the snake without causing a collision.

Moving UP (to row 5, column 2) not only avoids collision with the walls or the snake’s own body but also moves the snake toward the cluster of apples above (in row 4 and row 3). Thus, turning UP is the optimal move.\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#AA    #\n#H     #\n#SSSSS #\n#   SS #\n########\n\nConsidering the snake's current direction is UP and that moving UP from the head's position at row 5, column 2 will lead directly to an apple (located on row 4, column 2), this move is optimal. It allows the snake to eat an apple, grow longer, and increase the score by 1 point without any risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#  A A #\n#HA    #\n#S     #\n#SSSSS #\n#   SS #\n########\nThe optimal move is to turn RIGHT. Moving RIGHT from the current head position at (row3, column1) will immediately take the snake to an apple at (row3, column2). This move increases the score and avoids collisions, making it the best option.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  A AA#\n#SH    #\n#S     #\n#SSSSS #\n#   SS #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is currently at row 3, column 2 and it is moving to the RIGHT. Although continuing RIGHT would be safe, steering UP will bring the head closer to the nearby apple at row 2, column 3. Moving UP from (3,2) takes you to (2,2), setting up a subsequent move to the right that can reach the apple. This choice avoids collisions while advancing toward an apple, which is our goal for increasing the score.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n# HA AA#\n#SS    #\n#S     #\n#SSSS  #\n#   SS #\n########\n\nGiven the head is at (2,2) and moves are restricted due to the current upward motion (you cannot reverse from UP to DOWN), turning RIGHT is the best option. Moving RIGHT takes the head from (2,2) to (2,3), where an apple is located. Therefore, by choosing RIGHT, the snake will immediately eat an apple, increasing its score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n# SH AA#\n#SS    #\n#S     #\n#SSSS  #\n#   SSA#\n########\n\nGiven that the snake head is at row 3, column 4 and the current direction is RIGHT, the square immediately to the right (row 3, column 5) is empty. By moving RIGHT, the snake will continue toward the apples at row 3, columns 6 and 7. This move is safe and strategically sound, as it sets up for the snake to possibly consume an apple on a subsequent move. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# SSHAA#\n#SS    #\n#S     #\n#SSSS  #\n#   S A#\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is RIGHT and the snake’s head is at row 2, column 4, moving RIGHT will take it directly to (row 2, column 5), which contains an apple. Eating that apple will increase the score and grow the snake. This move is both safe and beneficial without any collisions. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n# SSSHA#\n#SS  A #\n#S     #\n#SSSS  #\n#   S A#\n########\n\nI choose to continue moving RIGHT. The snake’s head in row 3 at column 6 will progress into column 7, where an apple (A) resides. This move is in accordance with the rules (since reversing direction isn’t allowed) and leads directly to apple consumption, increasing the score. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here's the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n# SSSSH#\n#SS  A #\n#S  A  #\n#SSSS  #\n#   S A#\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is RIGHT and the snake’s head is at row 2, column 6, moving RIGHT would immediately hit the wall at (2,7). The snake cannot reverse direction (thus LEFT is not an option), so we consider UP and DOWN. Moving UP from (2,6) would bring the head to (1,6), which is safe but drifts away from the nearby apple. Meanwhile, moving DOWN places the head at (3,6), which is adjacent to the apple at (3,5) and sets up a potential apple-eating move in subsequent epochs. Therefore, the best direction to move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n# SSSSS#\n#SS  AH#\n#S  A  #\n#SSSS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 4, column 7 and it is currently moving DOWN. The available directions that are allowed are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT since reversing (UP) is prohibited. Moving DOWN would simply go to an empty cell at row 5, column 7, but if we change direction to LEFT, the snake’s head would move to row 4, column 6, where an apple (\"A\") is located. Eating an apple increases the score and grows the snake, which is clearly beneficial. Therefore, the best move is to turn LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n# SSSSS#\n#SS  HS#\n#S  A  #\n#SSSS  #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is currently at row 4, column 6 and it is moving LEFT. Checking the adjacent squares from the head’s position:\n• LEFT: The new head position would be row 4, column 5 which is empty.\n• UP: Would move into row 3, column 6, but that square is occupied by the snake’s body.\n• RIGHT: Would go to row 4, column 7 where the body is present.\n• DOWN: Would move to row 5, column 6 which is safe; however, it is not as direct a path toward the apple since the apple in row 5 is at column 5.\n\nThus, continuing in the current direction (LEFT) appears to be the best option since after moving left, the snake can then move down in a following move to reach the apple at row 5, column 5. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# SSSSS#\n#SS HSS#\n#S  A  #\n#SSS   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nAfter reviewing the board, I noticed that the snake’s head is at row 4, column 5 and the current direction is LEFT. Moving directly LEFT would land the head on an empty space at (row 4, column 4). However, I see an apple at row 5, column 5. Changing direction to DOWN is allowed (because from LEFT you can turn UP or DOWN, just not RIGHT) and would immediately move the snake’s head onto the apple cell. This not only makes the snake grow but also increases the score by one. Therefore, the optimal move is to go DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#    A #\n# SSSSS#\n#SS SSS#\n#S  H  #\n#SSS   #\n#  A  A#\n########\nI choose to move DOWN.\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current board:\n########\n#    A #\n# SSSSS#\n#SS SSS#\n#S  S  #\n#SS H  #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nConsidering the head is at row 6, column 5 and the current moving direction is DOWN, the cell immediately below (row 7, column 5) is empty. Moving DOWN keeps us on a safe path while setting up an approach to the apple at row 7, column 4 (by turning LEFT later) or even aiming toward the apple at row 7, column 7 with further maneuvers. Also, continuing in the same direction minimizes abrupt turns and avoids the risk of a self-collision, since the snake’s body is mostly above and to the left of the head. Therefore, the best move is to continue in the current direction or move DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n# SSSSS#\n#SS SSS#\n#S  S  #\n#S  S  #\n#  AH A#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board: The snake’s head is at row 6, column 4 (inside the board, with walls all around). The snake is currently moving DOWN, which would move its head into the wall (row 7, column 4) and lose the game. Since the snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is not allowed), the only valid turns are LEFT or RIGHT. Checking the adjacent cells from the head:\n• Moving RIGHT from (6,4) goes to (6,5) which is empty.\n• Moving LEFT from (6,4) goes to (6,3), which contains an apple. \n\nEating an apple increases the score and makes the snake grow. Therefore, the best move is to turn LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    A #\n# SSSSS#\n#SS SSS#\n#SA S  #\n#S  S  #\n#  HS A#\n########\nI choose to continue moving LEFT. This safely advances the head into an empty space, and from that position the snake can head upward in subsequent moves to reach the apple at (row5, column2). It avoids the risk of collision with walls or the snake’s own body, and it sets up a promising path toward increasing the score.\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n# SSSSS#\n#SS SSS#\n#SA S  #\n#   S  #\n# HSS A#\n########\n\nLooking at the board and the snake’s current head position at row6, column2 and knowing that it is currently moving LEFT (so it cannot reverse to RIGHT), we notice there is an apple at row4, column2 which is the closest apple in Manhattan distance (2 moves away vertically). Moving UP from (6,2) will bring the snake closer to that apple, as the next square (row5, col2) is free. Thus, the best move is to change direction from LEFT to UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n# SSSSS#\n#SS SSS#\n# A S  #\n# H S  #\n# SSS A#\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head is at row 5, column 2 and the current direction is UP, moving up will take the head into row 4, column 2 – which contains an apple ('A'). Eating an apple increases the score and grows the snake, so the best move is to continue going UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n# SSSSS#\n#SS SSS#\n# H S  #\n# S SA #\n# SSS A#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 4, column 2 and the current direction is UP. Moving UP would cause the head to move into a cell already occupied by part of the snake’s body (at row 3, column 2), which would result in a collision. The only legal moves that don’t reverse the current direction are LEFT or RIGHT. Evaluating both options, moving RIGHT (to row 4, column 3) moves the snake into an empty space and keeps options open for reaching an apple, such as the one at (5,5). Therefore, the optimal move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n# SSSSS#\n# S SSS#\n# SHS  #\n# S SA #\n# SSS A#\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 4, column 3 and it is moving RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would immediately crash into the body at (4,4), so that option is not safe. Checking the adjacent squares, the cell above (3,3) is free but the apple that is closest lies at (5,5), which is reached more directly by heading downward. Moving DOWN from (4,3) brings the snake to (5,3), a safe cell that starts a path toward the nearby apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here’s the current game board as provided:\n########\n#    A #\n# SSSSS#\n#   SSS#\n# SSS  #\n# SHSA #\n# SSS A#\n########\n\nAfter careful analysis of the board and factoring in the snake’s movement rules (remembering that the snake can’t reverse from its current DOWN direction), I examined its neighboring cells relative to the head at row 6, column 4. Checking UP (which is disallowed), LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN, all the adjacent squares are occupied by part of the snake’s body. In standard Snake rules only the tail cell is “safe” to move into (because it will be cleared when the snake advances), but based on the board layout none of the three legal moves (LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN) seem to target a cell that is the tail (the tail is found at the far end of the snake’s long body).\n\nFaced with no move that avoids immediate self‐collision, the best (and only) option is to continue in the current direction since changing direction would not bypass the inevitable collision. Therefore, the answer is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

Moving RIGHT from the current head position (row1, col3) will land the head onto the apple at row1, col4, increasing the score by 1 and extending the snake’s length without colliding with any walls or its own body.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here’s the current game board as provided:\n########\n#  SH  #\n#  S A #\n#      #\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at position (1,4) and it is currently moving RIGHT. Notice that immediately going UP would hit the wall and LEFT is not allowed since it directly reverses the current direction.\n\nEvaluating the two viable moves:\n• If we continue RIGHT, the head moves to (1,5) which is safe. However, the closest apple (at (2,5)) would then require a turn DOWN in the next move. \n• If we choose DOWN immediately, the head goes to (2,4). This directly positions the snake beside the apple at (2,5) (to the right of (2,4)), allowing us to grab it in the following epoch while keeping the snake safely away from walls and its own body.\n\nThus, to head toward the apple efficiently while ensuring safety, the best move now is to turn DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#  SS  #\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe best move is to go RIGHT so that the snake's head moves from (2,4) to (2,5) and consumes the apple there.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#A SS  #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board: The snake’s head is at row 2, column 5 and its current direction is RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would simply shift the head into an empty cell at (2,6) without any immediate benefit. However, by switching to DOWN, the snake will move into row 3, column 5, positioning it directly above one of the apples in row 4. In the subsequent move, continuing DOWN would let it reach an apple at (4,5) and increase the score. Additionally, DOWN is not a reversal of RIGHT (which would be LEFT) so it’s allowed.\n\nThus, my move is to change direction to DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#A  S  #\n#   SS #\n#    H #\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake's head (H) is at row 3, column 5 and it’s currently moving DOWN, we check the square immediately below. The square at row 4, column 5 contains an apple (A). Moving DOWN will allow the snake to eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length while avoiding any collision. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#A  S  #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#   AH #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nConsidering the current game board, the snake’s head is at row 5, column 6 and the apple immediately to its left is at row 5, column 5. Since the snake is currently moving DOWN, turning LEFT is allowed (it’s not a reversal) and will make the snake eat the apple, which is beneficial for the score.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n#A  S  #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#   HS #\n#      #\n# A   A#\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board and the snake’s current direction (LEFT), it is safest and most natural to continue moving in that same direction. There are no immediate hazards in the left square, and the snake avoids potential collisions with itself. Therefore, the move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A     #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#  HSS #\n#      #\n# A   A#\n########\n\nI analyzed the board and noticed that the snake’s head at (4,3) currently moving left can safely continue that direction. Moving left will take the head to (4,2), which is empty, keeping the snake on a safe path towards nearby apples (especially the one at (6,2) and eventually the apple at (1,1)). Thus, I recommend continuing left.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n# HSSS #\n#      #\n# A   A#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake’s head (H) is currently located on row 5 and the snake is moving LEFT. However, if it continues moving LEFT the head would hit the wall immediately. Reversing direction to RIGHT is not allowed by the rules, so the only safe options are UP or DOWN. \n\nLooking at nearby apples, there is an apple in row 7, column 2 (from the board line “# A   A#”). Moving DOWN from the head’s current position (row 5, column 2) will eventually bring the snake closer to that apple in just two moves (to row 6 then row 7). Thus, choosing DOWN not only avoids immediate danger, it also works toward the goal of collecting an apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#    S #\n# SSSS #\n# H    #\n# A   A#\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head is at (5,2) and the current direction is DOWN, if we continue moving down, the head will move to (6,2) where an apple (“A”) is located. By moving DOWN, the snake will immediately eat the apple, increasing the score by one and growing in length. This move is safe because (6,2) is not occupied by the snake's body and is not a wall.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#    S #\n# SSSS #\n# S    #\n#AH   A#\n########\n\nSince the snake is moving DOWN, it cannot reverse (UP is forbidden) and moving DOWN would hit the wall at row 7. Moving RIGHT from (6,2) is safe, but there is an apple immediately to the left at (6,1). By turning LEFT, the snake’s head will move to (6,1), collect the apple, increase the score, and grow in length without hitting any walls or its body. Therefore, the best move is to go LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   AS #\n# SSSS #\n# S    #\n#HS   A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at row6, col1 and is currently moving LEFT. Moving LEFT from (6,1) would hit the wall (at col0), so that option is deadly. Similarly, moving DOWN is not allowed because row7 is a wall. The only safe move available is to go UP. Therefore, the optimal move is to change direction to UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n# SSSS #\n#HS    #\n#SS   A#\n########\n\nThe only valid move is UP since moving LEFT would hit the wall, RIGHT would make the snake collide with its body, and DOWN is both reversing the direction (illegal) and would also cause a collision with the snake's body. Thus, moving UP to (4,1) is safe.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#HSSS  #\n#SS    #\n#SS   A#\n########\nI choose to continue moving UP since the cell above the head at (3,1) is safe and open. It avoids collision with the wall or the snake’s body while maintaining the current upward direction. \n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#H  A  #\n#SSS   #\n#SS    #\n#SS   A#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake’s head is at (3,1) and is moving UP already. There is an apple at (1,1) two rows above, so if we continue moving UP from (3,1) to (2,1) and then on the subsequent move to (1,1), we will eventually eat the apple. Moving LEFT would hit the wall and moving RIGHT would divert from the nearby apple without any added benefit at this stage. Thus, the optimal move is to continue in the current direction, which is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#H     #\n#S  A  #\n#SS    #\n#SS    #\n#SS   A#\n########\n\nThe best move is to continue UP. Moving UP from the current head position (row3, col1) brings the snake to (row2, col1), where an apple (‘A’) is located, allowing the snake to eat it, grow, and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#S  A  #\n#SS    #\n#SS    #\n#SS  AA#\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is currently at position (row2, column2) in the board (ignoring the wall offsets) and is moving UP. However, moving UP would place the snake into the wall on the top row, and moving LEFT would also hit the wall. The only safe move is to continue with a 90° turn to the RIGHT. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n#SH    #\n#S     #\n#S  A  #\n#S     #\n#SS    #\n#SS  AA#\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 1, column 2 and is moving RIGHT. Moving straight ahead (RIGHT) leads the snake to an empty square, keeping it in a safe zone and giving time to adjust later toward any apples. Hence, I’ll choose to continue moving in the current RIGHT direction.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSH   #\n#S     #\n#S  A  #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SS  AA#\n########\nI examined the board: the head \"H\" is at row 2, column 4 and is currently moving RIGHT. Moving UP would hit a wall, and LEFT is not allowed because the snake cannot reverse direction. Continuing RIGHT to (row 2, column 5) is safe since it’s an empty space, and it moves us closer to the apple at row 4, column 5 in future epochs. Therefore, the optimal move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n#SSSH  #\n#S     #\n#S  A  #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S   AA#\n########\n\nConsidering the snake's head is currently at row 1, column 4 and moving RIGHT, the closest apple is positioned at row 3, column 4. Moving RIGHT would keep the snake on the same row, distancing it from the apple. Instead, switching to DOWN will start aligning the snake with that apple, allowing its head to eventually reach it in the next move (with the head moving from row 1, col 4 to row 2, col 4 and then toward row 3, col 4).\n\nThus, based on the board layout and current direction, the best choice is to change direction to DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#S  H  #\n#S  A  #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#    AA#\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 2, column 4 and is currently moving DOWN. There is an apple directly below the head at row 3, column 4. Moving DOWN will guide the head onto the apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake’s length without any risk of collision. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSS  #\n#S  S  #\n#S  H  #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n# A  AA#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the apple targets are on the lower row (row 6) while the snake’s head is at row 3 in column 4. Continuing in the current direction “DOWN” moves the head from (3,4) to (4,4), safely advancing toward the apples. No immediate collision is expected and it positions the snake closer to the apple at (6,5) or (6,6) in subsequent moves. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSS  #\n#S  S  #\n#S  S  #\n#S  H  #\n#      #\n# A  AA#\n########\n\nConsidering the current board, the snake's head is at row 5, column 5 (if we count the first row as the top border) and is moving DOWN. Among the three available moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) — with UP disallowed because it would reverse the snake’s direction — moving RIGHT appears to put the snake in a more favorable position toward the nearest apple (located at row 7, column 6, if we index with the wall). By moving RIGHT, the snake will be able to maneuver downward in the next steps to reach the apple at (row 7, column 6) in a minimal number of moves. \n\nThus, my move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#S  S  #\n#S  S  #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n# A  AA#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the situation: The snake’s head at row5, column6 is currently moving RIGHT, but continuing to move RIGHT would eventually risk hitting the wall (since the next cell after (5,7) would be the wall if we don’t turn soon). There’s an apple positioned at (7,6) on the board. By turning DOWN now from (5,6) to (6,6), the snake heads safely into an empty cell and sets itself up to reach the apple on the following move. Therefore, the best safe move that also moves toward an apple is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSS  #\n#S  S  #\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n#    H #\n# A  AA#\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is currently at row 5, column 5 and the snake is moving DOWN. Looking at the board, the square directly below the head (row 6, column 5) has an apple ('A'). Moving DOWN will allow the snake to eat the apple safely without colliding with a wall or its own body. Since taking an apple increases the score and the snake grows in length, the best move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSS  #\n#S  S  #\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#AA  HA#\n########\nI analyzed the board. The snake’s head is at row 6, column 5 and the current direction is DOWN. Moving DOWN would hit the wall on row 7. Turning LEFT is safe but only moves to an empty space.

Therefore, the best move is to go RIGHT.\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSSS  #\n#S  S  #\n#   S A#\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#AA  SH#\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 7, column 7 (within the walls).

Moving UP would take the head to position (5,7) which is empty, making it the only safe move. Turning LEFT would send the snake into (6,6), a space occupied by its body (and not the cell that will be vacated by the tail), and turning RIGHT would hit a wall. Reversing the direction (DOWN) is not allowed. \n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# SSS  #\n#   S  #\n#   S A#\n#   SSH#\n#    SS#\n#AA  SS#\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is currently at row 4, column 6 and it is moving UP. The cell directly above it (row 3, column 6) contains an apple. Moving UP will let the snake consume the apple immediately, increase the score by one, and grow the snake in length. Since this is the optimal move and does not involve any risk of collision, my answer is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# SSS A#\n#   S  #\n#   S H#\n#   SSS#\n#    SS#\n#AA  SS#\n########\n\nBased on the board and current snake direction (UP), moving UP appears to be the best option. This move continues in the current direction and will bring the snake closer to the apple located at row 2, column 7 (reachable in two moves), while avoiding immediate collision with either the snake’s body or the walls.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here's the current game board:\n########\n#  SS A#\n#   S H#\n#   S S#\n#   SSS#\n#    SS#\n#AA  SS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 2, column 6 and is moving UP. If we choose UP, the head will move to row 1, column 6 where there is an apple ('A'). Eating an apple increases the score and the snake grows, with the current head turning into a body piece ('S') and the apple location becoming the new head ('H'). This move is beneficial since it lets us score and grow.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#  SS H#\n#   S S#\n#   S S#\n#   SSS#\n#    SS#\n#AA ASS#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake's head ('H') is at row 1, column 6 and is currently moving UP.

The cell directly below the head (row 4, col 5) is empty, making it the safest move. Since the current direction is DOWN and turning directly opposite (UP) is not allowed, continuing in the same direction (DOWN) is our best choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    SS#\n#    SS#\n#   SHS#\n#   SSS#\n#    SS#\n#AA ASS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head (“H”) is at row 3, column 5 and is currently moving DOWN.

Moving RIGHT from (3,5) would land at (3,6) and moving DOWN would also hit a body‐segment, neither of which are safe.\n\nHowever, if the snake moves LEFT, its head would go from (3,5) to (3,4). Although (3,4) contains an “S”, careful inspection of the snake’s continuous body shows that (3,4) is the tail end of the snake. In a typical snake move, unless an apple is eaten, the tail cell is removed right after the head advances.

The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

Moving LEFT takes the head closer to that apple without violating the rule against reversing direction (since DOWN is not allowed from UP). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nFrom the head position at row 4, column 2 and with the current direction LEFT, we have an apple immediately below at row 5, column 2. Changing direction from LEFT to DOWN is valid (it isn’t the direct reverse) and allows the snake to consume the apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H   A#\n#     A#\n########\nBased on the board and the current direction (DOWN), moving RIGHT will bring the snake closer to the nearby apples, especially the one on row 6 (col 6) in the current configuration. It’s a safe move that avoids reversing the direction while progressing towards an apple.\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SH  A#\n#     A#\n########\n\nI will maintain the current direction (RIGHT) to steer safely toward the apple in the same row. This move avoids turning unnecessarily and heads in the correct general direction, keeping the snake on a safe path.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SH A#\n#     A#\n########\n\nConsidering the current game state, the snake’s head is at row 6, column 5 and is moving RIGHT. There is an apple two steps ahead on the right side (in row 6, column 7). Continuing in the current direction (RIGHT) is safe because the immediate cell in that direction (row 6, column 6) is empty and will eventually lead the snake toward the apple without causing a collision. Also, switching to UP or DOWN does not offer any immediate benefit over progressing RIGHT. Therefore, the optimal move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SHA#\n#     A#\n########\n\nI recommend moving RIGHT. By moving RIGHT, the snake’s head from row 6, column 6 will enter the cell at row 6, column 7 containing an apple. This move will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1. Since the snake is currently moving RIGHT and cannot reverse, continuing in the RIGHT direction is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSH#\n#   A A#\n########\nThe best move is DOWN because if the snake moves DOWN from its current head at row6, column6, it will move to row7, column6 where there is an apple, resulting in immediate growth and a point increase. Also, moving RIGHT would hit the wall and moving LEFT is not allowed (the snake cannot reverse its direction), so DOWN is the optimal safe move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#   SSS#\n#   A H#\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN, so it cannot reverse to UP. Moving DOWN would hit the wall since the cell below the head is a wall. Moving RIGHT is not allowed either because that would immediately hit the wall on the right. The only safe move is LEFT. Moving LEFT from the head at (6,6) will position it at (6,5), which is safe and puts it closer to the apple at (6,4).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#    SS#\n#   AHS#\n########\n\nI analyzed the board: The snake’s head is at row 7, column 6 while the snake is currently moving LEFT. Looking at the cell immediately to the LEFT (row 7, column 5), I see it contains an apple ('A'). Moving LEFT will result in the snake eating the apple, increasing the score, and is safe because there’s no collision with its own body or the walls. Therefore, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n#    SS#\n#   HSS#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, our head is at row6, column4 and the current direction is LEFT. Checking the adjacent cells from (6,4):\n• LEFT brings us to (6,3) – an empty space.\n• UP leads to (5,4) – also an empty space.\n• RIGHT would lead into our own body (collision).\n• DOWN would hit the wall.\n\nBoth LEFT and UP are viable moves, but since we’re already moving LEFT and it maintains our current course safely while allowing us to eventually reach the apple (for example, after moving LEFT, we can adjust upward later toward the apple at (4,3)), the best option is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n#     S#\n#  HSSS#\n########\n\nGiven that the snake's head is at row6, column3 and the nearest apple is at row4, column3 (only two moves upward), the best move is to turn UP. The move UP is valid because it's not the opposite of the current LEFT direction and it leads us directly toward the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n#  H   #\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nSince the current direction is UP and the snake’s head is at (row 5, column 3), moving UP takes it directly to (row 4, column 3) where an apple is located. This move allows the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by one. Therefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n#A S   #\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nI analyzed the board: the snake’s head is at row 4, column 3 and is currently moving UP, and the snake cannot reverse (so we cannot choose DOWN). The nearby apples are at (1,5), (3,5), and (5,1). Moving UP (from (4,3) to (3,3)) is safe and keeps the snake going in its current direction while moving closer toward the apple at (3,5) in subsequent moves, and there is no immediate danger of colliding with its body or the walls.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  H A #\n#  S   #\n#A S   #\n#  SSS #\n########\nBased on the current board state, the snake’s head (at row 4, column 4) is moving upward, but there is an apple at row 4, column 6 – just two moves away if heading right. Changing direction from UP to RIGHT is valid (it’s not a reversal) and safely brings the snake closer to that apple. Therefore, the best move is to change direction to RIGHT.\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  SHA #\n#  S   #\n#A S   #\n#  SS  #\n########\n\nSince the snake’s current head is at row 3, column 4 and its direction is RIGHT, moving RIGHT leads the head into the cell at (row 3, column 5) which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score and grow the snake. Therefore, the correct move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  SSH #\n#  S   #\n#AAS   #\n#  SS  #\n########\nAfter analyzing the board and considering that one of the apples is at (1,5) – two cells directly above the current head at (3,5) – the optimal move is to change direction to UP. This move will steer the snake toward that apple in the next few moves while keeping within the allowed directions.\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#    H #\n#  SSS #\n#  S   #\n#AAS   #\n#  S   #\n########\n\nThe best move is to continue moving UP. Moving UP from the current head position at row3, column6 will move the head to row2, column6, where there is an apple ('A'). This move will result in the snake eating the apple and increasing your score by 1. Since the move is valid and it collects an apple without colliding with anything, UP is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#    H #\n#    S #\n#  SSS #\n#  S A #\n#AAS   #\n#  S   #\n########\n\nBased on the current board, the snake’s head is at row 1, column 5 and is moving UP. However, moving UP would immediately hit the top wall (row 0 is filled with '#' characters), which is fatal. The snake cannot reverse into DOWN, so the remaining safe options are to turn LEFT or RIGHT. Looking at the board, turning LEFT would move the snake’s head to (1,4) which is a safe, empty cell. This is also a potentially better move as it might allow us to route towards some of the apples later. Therefore, the optimal move is to turn LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n#   HS #\n#    S #\n#  SSS #\n#  S A #\n#AAS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 1, column 4 and it’s currently heading LEFT. There are three apples on the board: one at row 4, column 5, and two at row 5 (columns 1 and 2). The closest apple is at row 4, column 5. To approach that apple, we need to eventually head downward\/right from the head’s current position. Although the snake’s current direction is LEFT and it could continue straight, if it goes LEFT it will move farther away from the apple (ending at row 1, column 3). Instead, if we change direction to DOWN, the snake’s head will move from (1,4) to (2,4), reducing the Manhattan distance to the closest apple (now |4–2| + |5–4| = 2 + 1 = 3). Also, the move DOWN is allowed (the snake cannot reverse, so RIGHT is forbidden, and UP would hit the wall). The cell at (2,4) is empty and safe, and it puts the snake in a better position to subsequently steer towards the apple. \n\nTherefore, my answer is: DOWN\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#   SS #\n#   HS #\n#  SSS #\n#  S A #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current state:\n• The snake’s head (H) is located in row 3, column 5 (if counting columns from the left, starting at 1).\n• The snake is moving DOWN, so its straight move would take it into row 4, column 5, which is occupied by part of its body ('S')—resulting in a collision.\n• Moving RIGHT would also put the snake into a cell occupied by 'S'.\n• The only safe direction that doesn’t reverse (as reversing is not allowed) is LEFT. By moving LEFT, the head will advance into a free space.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#   SS #\n#  HSS #\n#  SSS #\n#    A #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n########\n\nConsidering the current board, the head is at (2,3) and the snake is moving LEFT. Examining the three available moves (LEFT, UP, and DOWN—remembering that a reverse move RIGHT is not allowed), we see that:\n• Moving DOWN from (2,3) would immediately hit a body segment at (3,3), which is fatal.\n• Moving UP to (1,3) is safe; however, it does not put the snake nearer to the apple(s) compared with continuing in the current direction.\n• Remaining in the LEFT direction moves the head to (2,2), which is safe and places the snake in a favorable position to reach one of the apples (specifically the apple at row5, col1 or col2) with fewer moves.\n\nThus, the best move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#   SS #\n# HSSS #\n#   SS #\n#    A #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board: the snake’s head is at (row2, col2) and is currently moving LEFT. Checking its adjacent cells, moving LEFT (to row2, col1) is a safe move—as that cell is empty and avoids immediate collision with walls or the snake's body. Although there are apples on the board (one at row4 and two on row5), none are immediately reachable in one move. Continuing in the current direction lets us keep the game safe and positions the snake to eventually maneuver toward an apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#   SS #\n#HSSSS #\n#    S #\n#    A #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n########\n\nI choose to move DOWN. This move avoids the wall on the left, and it heads toward the apple at row6, column2 which is in a promising direction.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#   SS #\n#SSSSS #\n#H     #\n#    A #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at (3,1) moving DOWN. The nearest apple is at (5,1) which is two cells down. By continuing in the current DOWN direction the head will move to (4,1) (a safe, empty space) and set up to reach the apple (5,1) on the next move. Therefore, the best move here is to continue going DOWN.\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#   SS #\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#H   A #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n########\n\nAfter examining the board, I see that the snake's head (H) is at Row 5, Column 2 and the snake is currently moving DOWN. Directly below the head, at Row 6, Column 2, there's an apple (A). Moving DOWN will therefore allow the snake to eat the apple, growing in length and increasing the score. In addition, this move is safe since it does not lead to a wall collision or cause the snake to run into itself, making DOWN the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#   SS #\n#SSSS  #\n#S    A#\n#S   A #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake is moving DOWN and cannot reverse (cannot go UP), the available moves are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Going LEFT would hit the wall, and moving DOWN would just land in an empty space. However, if the snake turns RIGHT, its head (currently at row 6, column 2) will immediately move onto an apple (at row 6, column 3 in the board if we count from the wall, or simply the adjacent apple to the right) and collect it thereby increasing the score and allowing the snake to grow. This is the optimum move. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#   SS #\n#SSSS  #\n#S    A#\n#S   AA#\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board with the snake’s head at row 6, column 3 and its current moving direction as RIGHT. The cell to the RIGHT of the head (row 6, column 4) is empty and safe, so continuing in the RIGHT direction will allow the snake to keep moving without collision and eventually work toward the apples. Therefore, my next move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#   S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#S    A#\n#S   AA#\n#SSH   #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current board, the snake's head is at row 6, column 4 (in a 1-indexed view) moving RIGHT. Ahead of the head (to the RIGHT) is an empty space and it gives us a safe and direct continuation of our current movement. With apples located at row 4, columns 6 and 7 (and one more apple at row 3, column 7), moving RIGHT keeps us on track without causing a collision with the walls or the snake’s own body. \n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#SSSS  #\n#S    A#\n#S   AA#\n#SSSH  #\n#      #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board: The snake’s head is at row 5, column 4 and is currently moving RIGHT. To get closer to the apples—particularly the one at row 4, column 5—it makes sense to change direction. Moving UP will take the snake’s head from (5,4) to (4,4), positioning it one step away from the apple. Since turning UP is allowed (the snake cannot reverse but can turn UP, RIGHT, or DOWN when moving RIGHT), the best move is to go UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#SSS   #\n#S    A#\n#S  HAA#\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head is at (4,4) and the apple is immediately to its right at (4,5), it is optimal to turn RIGHT to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score. This move is safe as it does not cause a collision with the walls or the snake’s body, and the turn is allowed since it isn’t a direct reversal of the current UP direction.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here's the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#SSS   #\n#SA   A#\n#S  SHA#\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board: the snake’s head is at row 5, column 6 and is currently moving RIGHT. Directly to the RIGHT (row 5, column 7) is an apple (\"A\"). By moving RIGHT, the snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1. Since this move does not cause any collision with walls or its own body, it is the best move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Repeating the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#SSS   #\n#SA   A#\n#S  SSH#\n#SSSS  #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at row 5, column 7 and is currently moving RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would hit the wall since column 8 is a wall. Moving DOWN to row 6, column 7 is safe but does not give an immediate opportunity to eat an apple. However, moving UP would place the head at row 4, column 7 where an apple is located. Eating an apple is beneficial because the snake grows and the score increases.\n\nGiven these factors, the best move is to change direction to UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#SSS   #\n#SA   H#\n#S ASSS#\n#SSSS  #\n#A     #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is currently at row 4, column 7 and moving UP. Moving RIGHT would hit the wall and moving DOWN is not allowed because it would reverse the snake’s direction (UP). Between continuing UP (to row 3, column 7) and turning LEFT (to row 4, column 6), turning LEFT moves the snake closer to the apple located at row 4, column 3. Therefore, the chosen move is to turn LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Repeating the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#SS    #\n#SA  HS#\n#S ASSS#\n#SSSS  #\n#A     #\n########\n\nBased on the current board and the rules, the snake’s head is at row 4, column 6 while moving LEFT. Checking the neighboring squares, moving LEFT to (row 4, column 5) is safe and steers the snake toward the apple at (row 4, column 3), which is reachable in a few moves. The UP option is also safe, but LEFT is directly aligned with one of the closer apples. Therefore, the best move is to continue going LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#S     #\n#SA HSS#\n#S ASSS#\n#SSSS  #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrently, the snake’s head is at position (row 3, column 4) and is moving LEFT.

Moving DOWN from the current head position will move the snake to (4,2), which is empty. Moreover, the apple at (4,3) lies immediately to the right of that position, making it easier to gather in subsequent moves. Since the snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is disallowed), and UP would also not target an apple as directly as DOWN, the best decision is to go DOWN.\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n# SSSSS#\n#SHASSS#\n#SSSSA #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe only safe and beneficial move is to go RIGHT so that the snake's head will move onto the apple at row5, column4, increasing the score and growing the snake without colliding with its body.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","I'll start by rewriting the given board exactly as it is:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# SSSSS#\n#SSHSSS#\n#SSSSA #\n#A     #\n########\n\n──────────────────────────────\nAnalysis:\n\nWe are playing a Snake game on an 8×8 board. The walls (“#”) border the board. The snake’s head is drawn as “H” (located on row 4, column 3 in the board’s internal coordinates if we count from 0) and the rest of its body “S” fills several cells. There are also three apples (“A”) on the board: one at row 1, column 4; one at row 5 (appears at the fifth or sixth position in that row); and one at row 6, column 1.\n\nThe snake is moving RIGHT. On every move the snake’s head advances one cell in the given direction. (If no apple is eaten the cell at the snake’s tail is freed in the same epoch.) One very important “trick” in Snake is that it is safe to move into the cell currently occupied by the tail if, by advancing, that cell is being removed from the snake.\n\nLet’s check the three possible new positions (recall that reversing direction is forbidden, so from RIGHT the snake cannot choose LEFT):\n\n• If we go RIGHT – the head would move from (4,3) to (4,4). In the drawing, cell (4,4) is marked “S”. (In many Snake situations this “S” would eventually be removed as the tail moves—but here, after careful reconstruction of the snake’s continuous body, none of the snake’s adjacent cells is in fact the tail cell; rather, all of them are “internal” portions that won’t be removed this turn.) Therefore moving RIGHT would have the snake’s head immediately run into a body segment.\n\n• If we go UP – the head would go from (4,3) to (3,3). Again the board shows that cell as “S” and not the tail; collision occurs immediately.\n\n• If we go DOWN – the head would shift from (4,3) to (5,3). That cell is also “S” and is not the snake’s tail (it is an internal cell in the thick snake).\n\nThus every available “legal” input (UP, RIGHT, or DOWN) causes the snake’s head to enter a cell occupied by its own body. (Turning LEFT is prohibited since that would be an immediate reversal of direction.) In this board configuration it appears that there is no move that avoids immediate collision; the snake is trapped.\n\nSince no move will let the snake keep living, the “best” choice is normally to continue in the current direction. In many puzzles the “stay on course” answer is chosen when every legal option leads to collision. (Sometimes one picks the move that might “at least” attempt to harvest an apple—but in this board no adjacent cell holds an apple.)\n\nTherefore, based on the game board and the analysis above, I choose the current direction, RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Moving UP from our head’s current position at row 3, column 3 places it at row 2, column 3, which is safe and keeps our options open to steer toward the nearby apples on subsequent moves. This also avoids any illegal reverse movement.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#A H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head (H) is at row 3, column 3 (if we number positions starting at 0 on each line after the wall). There are two apples on the upper left side: one in row 2 (in “# A    #”) and another right in row 3 (in “#A H   #”). Since the snake is currently moving UP, continuing straight would take the head into row 2, column 3 which moves it a step closer to the apple in row 2 (which is at column 2). However, if we instead choose to turn LEFT, the snake will move from (3,3) to (3,2) – this positions the snake directly one move away from the apple in row 3 at column 1 (since on the next turn a move LEFT would bring it to (3,1), where the apple is located).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe moves, but turning LEFT creates a more direct horizontal route toward an apple (the one in row 3), allowing us potentially to eat the apple in fewer moves without the need for a subsequent vertical adjustment. Thus, a LEFT turn is the most straightforward choice here.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#AH    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is currently at row 2, column 2 and it is moving LEFT, moving left immediately brings the head from (2,2) to (2,1) where there is an apple. Eating that apple will grow the snake and increase the score. Since turning left is allowed (and it is not a reversal), the best move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# A    #\n#HS    #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nI choose to move UP. When moving UP, the snake’s head will go from its current position (row3, column2) to the cell in row2, column2, which contains an apple. This move allows the snake to eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length without colliding with the wall or itself.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#HA    #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\nThe snake's head is at row 1, column 1 and currently moving UP. Continuing UP would hit the wall, and moving LEFT would also hit the wall. The only safe move is to change direction to RIGHT so that the snake moves into the apple at row 1, column 2. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SH    #\n#S A   #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nI will choose to keep moving in the current direction. Going RIGHT will safely move the snake into an empty space and bring it closer to the nearby apple (which is one cell down and to the right). Since turning LEFT is not allowed and UP would hit a wall, the RIGHT move is the best option.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSH   #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSS   #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n########\n\nConsidering the board, the snake’s head is at row 2, column 3 and the snake is currently moving DOWN. By continuing in the DOWN direction, the head will move from (2,3) to (3,3) which is safe. Moreover, this path sets up the snake to reach the apple at (4,3) on the following move, allowing it to eat the apple and grow. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving in the same direction, i.e., DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Repeating the game board:\n########\n# SS   #\n#  S   #\n#  H   #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the current direction is DOWN and the snake's head is at the fourth row and fourth column, moving DOWN will put the snake head directly on the apple at row 5, column 4. This move results in eating an apple, increasing the score, and growing the snake—making it the optimal choice. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here's the current game board:\n########\n# SS   #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#A H   #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at (4,3) and its current moving direction is DOWN, if we continue moving DOWN the snake's head will move into (5,3) where an apple is located. This move allows the snake to eat the apple, increase its score by 1, and safely progress without colliding with itself or a wall. Therefore, the optimal move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# SS   #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#A S   #\n#  H  A#\n#    A #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at row 6, column 3 and the current movement is DOWN, we have three possible valid moves (DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT – we cannot reverse to UP). Looking at the board layout and the positions of the apples ((row5, col1), (row6, col6), and (row7, col5)), moving RIGHT is a promising option because it will steer the snake toward the apple at (row6, col6) in the near future. Although moving DOWN is safe, it doesn’t head in the direction of any apple immediately, and turning LEFT leads away from the larger cluster of apples on the right-hand side. Therefore, I choose to turn RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current Game Board:\n########\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#A S   #\n#  SH A#\n#    A #\n########\n\nGiven the snake’s current head at row 6, column 4 moving RIGHT, the safest and most strategic move is to continue going RIGHT. This move brings the head to row 6, column 5, leaving an open space. It also positions the snake closer to the apple located at row 6, column 6 on the following move, allowing it the opportunity to increase its score. Therefore, the optimal direction is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#A S   #\n#  SSHA#\n#    A #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 6, column 6 and it is moving RIGHT. Looking at the board, the square immediately to the right (row 6, column 7) contains an apple ('A'). Moving RIGHT will make the snake eat the apple, increase its score by 1, and grow its length, without colliding with itself or a wall. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n# A    #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#A S   #\n#  SSSH#\n#    A #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board. The snake’s head is at row 5, column 6 and is currently moving RIGHT. However, moving right would hit the wall and the snake cannot reverse (so LEFT is forbidden). The nearest apple is at row 6, column 5. Moving DOWN will bring the head to row 6, column 6, from where the apple at (6,5) is more easily reached in subsequent moves. Thus, I choose to change direction to DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#A S   #\n#  SSSS#\n#    AH#\n########\n\nConsidering the snake's current head position at row6, column6 and its movement direction as DOWN, here are the options:\n\n• Moving DOWN from (6,6) would move it to (7,6); however, row7 is a wall.\n• Moving RIGHT from (6,6) (which would mean going to (6,7)) would also hit the wall.\n• Moving LEFT from (6,6) brings it to (6,5), where there is an apple.\n\nSince moving LEFT is both a legal move and allows the snake to eat the apple (increasing the score and growing the snake), the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# AA   #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#A S   #\n#  SSSS#\n#    HS#\n########\n\nBased on the snake’s current head position at (6,5), its current movement direction (LEFT), and the positions of obstacles (body segments and walls), the safest move is to continue moving LEFT. Moving UP or DOWN would either hit part of the snake’s body or the wall, and reversing direction (RIGHT) is not allowed.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n# AA   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A S   #\n#  SSSS#\n#   HSS#\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s current head is at row 6, column 4 and its current moving direction is LEFT, we must choose a direction that is not a direct reversal. Checking all neighbouring cells:\n• LEFT: The cell at (6,3) is free (an empty space).\n• UP: Would put the head at (5,4) but that cell already has an S.\n• DOWN: The cell at (7,4) is a wall (“#”).\n• RIGHT is not allowed because it is the opposite of LEFT.\n\nThus, the only safe move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAfter moving LEFT, the snake’s head will advance from (6,4) to (6,3). Since no apple (“A”) is encountered, the snake will not grow; instead, the tail segment will be removed. Reconstructing the snake’s body from the board (by connectivity) we deduce that the tail is the body segment at (4,3). Therefore, the new snake positions become:\n• New head: (6,3) marked as H.\n• The previous head at (6,4) becomes a body segment (S).\n• All other body segments shift accordingly, and the tail at (4,3) is removed.\n• All apples remain in place.\n\nAccordingly, the updated board would become:\n\n########\n# AA   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  SSSS#\n#  HSSS#\n########\n\nThe correct move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n# AA   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  SSSS#\n#  HSSS#\n########\n\nBased on the current state, the snake's head is at row 7, column 4 and is moving LEFT. The only safe option is to continue moving LEFT, because:\n• Turning UP would move into row 6, column 4 where the snake’s body exists.\n• Turning DOWN would hit the wall.\nThus, the correct move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# AA   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#   SSS#\n# HSSSS#\n########\nAfter analyzing the current board and the snake’s head position at row 6, column 2 (with the current movement direction being LEFT), I see that moving DOWN is not viable because it would hit the wall, while continuing LEFT would eventually force a turn to approach the nearest apple at row 4, column 1. Instead, moving UP—placing the head at row 5, column 2—moves the snake closer to that apple. Thus, the best move is to change direction to UP.\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n# AA   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n# H  SS#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n\nI will choose the UP direction. Moving UP from the current head position (row 5, column 2) to (row 4, column 2) is safe as it does not result in a collision with any wall or the snake's body, and it moves the snake closer to the nearby apple positioned at (4,1) in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current Game Board:\n########\n# AA   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AH    #\n# S   S#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n\nConsidering the snake is currently moving UP and its head is at row 5, column 3, we see an apple directly to its LEFT at row 5, column 2 (\"A\" in \"#AH    #\"). Choosing LEFT will immediately eat that apple, increase the score, and grow the snake—which is beneficial for the game.\n\nTherefore, my move is to turn LEFT.\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n# AA A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#HS    #\n# S   S#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n\nSince the snake's current direction is LEFT (moving into the wall if it continues), we must choose between UP and DOWN (RIGHT is not allowed because it is a reversal). Moving UP from the head at row4, column1 puts the snake at row3, column1. That square is free and also moves us in the general direction toward the apples located on row1. Therefore, the best move is to go UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n# AA A #\n#      #\n#H     #\n#SS    #\n# S    #\n# SSSSS#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board with the current snake moving UP from its head at row 3, column 1, the safest and most strategic option is to continue moving UP. This avoids any wall collisions and heads in the direction of the apples located in row 1, while also not reversing the snake’s movement. \n\nAnswer: UP","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n# AA A #\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#SS    #\n# S    #\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board: the snake’s head is at row 2, column 1 (if we count rows and columns starting from 0 at the top‐left, with the walls forming the border). The current direction is UP so its natural forward movement would take it from (2,1) to (1,1). Checking row 1 shows that (1,1) is an empty space. Although this move doesn’t immediately give an apple, it sets the snake up to be adjacent to the apple at (1,2) on the next move. (Other moves like RIGHT would send the head to (2,2) — still safe — but moving UP keeps the natural course and offers opportunity to turn right in the subsequent epoch to eat the apple.) \n\nThus, the best move is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#HAA A #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SS    #\n# S    #\n# SSS  #\n########\nAfter analyzing the current state: The snake's head is at row1, column1 and is moving UP. Moving UP would hit the wall, and turning DOWN is not allowed since the snake cannot reverse direction. Moving LEFT would also hit a wall because row1, column0 is a wall. The only remaining safe move is turning RIGHT, which would move the snake into row1, column2 where an apple is present. Hence, the correct move is RIGHT.\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SHA A #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SS    #\n# S A  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is located at row 2, column 2 (with the top left corner being row 1, column 1). Since the snake is currently moving RIGHT and the square immediately to its right (row 2, column 3) contains an apple (\"A\"), moving RIGHT will allow the snake to consume the apple and increase its score. Also, going RIGHT is allowed because it is not a reverse move. \n\nThus, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSH A #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SS    #\n# S A  #\n# SSSA #\n########\nI choose to continue in the current direction, RIGHT.

This move will lead the snake's head from its current position (row 1, column 4) directly into the cell containing an apple at (row 1, column 5), thereby increasing the score and growing the snake.\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SSSSH #\n#S     #\n#S  A  #\n#SS    #\n# S A  #\n# SS A #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake’s head is currently at row 1, column 5 and is moving RIGHT. Checking the adjacent cells: moving UP isn’t allowed (it would hit the wall at row 0), and turning RIGHT would only put the head at (1,6) without bringing it any closer to an apple. By choosing DOWN the snake moves to (2,5), which is a safe open space and sets up a potential approach toward the apple at (3,4) or even the one further down (at 6,5) in upcoming moves. Therefore, I decide to change the direction to DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSSS #\n#S   H #\n#S  A  #\n#SS    #\n# S A  #\n# S  A #\n########\nBased on the current position of the snake's head at row3, column6 and considering the apple positioned just below and to the left, continuing in the current direction (\"DOWN\") is a safe and effective move. Moving DOWN puts the head at row4, column6, which is an empty cell adjacent to the apple at row4, column5, allowing a future turn to capture the apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSSS #\n#S   S #\n#S  AH #\n#SS    #\n# S A  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake's head is located at row 3, column 5 and is currently moving DOWN. However, if we look at the cell immediately to the left of the head (row 3, column 4), we notice an apple ('A') sitting there. Since the snake can safely turn left (as it is not the reverse of its current direction) and gain an immediate point by eating the apple, the optimal move here is to go LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#SSSSSA#\n#S   S #\n#S  HS #\n#SS    #\n# S A  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at (3,4) and moving LEFT, but it cannot reverse its direction (i.e., RIGHT is forbidden). Among the available moves (LEFT, UP, DOWN), the apple at (5,4) is the closest target (Manhattan distance 2). Moving DOWN will directly guide the snake toward that apple. Therefore, the best move is to change direction and go DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SSSSSA#\n#S   S #\n#S  SS #\n#SS H  #\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 4, column 4. The snake is currently moving DOWN. If the snake continues DOWN, its head will move to row 5, column 4, where there is an apple ('A'). This move will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase its score without causing an immediate collision with a wall or its own body.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSSSA#\n#S A S #\n#S  SS #\n#SS S  #\n#   H  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board. The snake’s head is at row 5, column 4 and it’s currently moving DOWN. From that position, moving DOWN would take the head to (6,4) – an empty square safely advancing toward the nearby apple at (6,5). Continuing in the current direction is safe since there is no risk of immediate collision with the body or wall, and it puts the snake in a good position to grab the apple in the following move. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#SSSSSA#\n#S A S #\n#S  SS #\n#S  S  #\n#   S  #\n#   HA #\n########\n\nI choose to move RIGHT. By moving RIGHT, the snake’s head will move from row7, col5 into row7, col6, which contains an apple. Eating the apple increases the score by one, and the snake’s head becomes H in that cell while the old head cell becomes part of the snake body (S). The updated board will therefore be:\n\n########\n#SSSSSA#\n#S A S #\n#S  SS #\n#S  S  #\n#   S  #\n#   SH #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSSSSA#\n#S A S #\n#S  SS #\n#S  S A#\n#   S  #\n#   SH #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board and found that with the snake’s head at row 7, column 6 (with walls around and all snake body positions marked with S), the most natural approach is to continue in the current RIGHT direction. Moving RIGHT places the head into (7,7), which is clear of any walls or self-collision and positions the snake closer to the apple at (row5, col7). Turning UP could also be feasible, but maintaining the current RIGHT direction avoids an unnecessary turn while keeping safe space for subsequent moves.

However, moving RIGHT would result in hitting a wall (since column 8 is a wall), and moving DOWN would also lead to a collision with the wall (row 8 is entirely walls). The only viable move that does not reverse direction and avoids an immediate collision is UP, which moves the head to row 6, column 7—a safe, empty space.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#SSSSSA#\n#S A S #\n#   SS #\n#   S A#\n#   S H#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nGiven the snake's current head is located on row 6, column 7 and its current direction is UP, the cell directly above (row 5, column 7) contains an apple ('A').

By moving UP from the snake's current head at row 5, column 7, the snake will move toward row 4, column 7 which is empty and on a clear path leading eventually to an apple located at row 2, column 7.

The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

Moving UP will let the snake eat that apple, increasing the score.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#  S   #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nBased on the current board, the snake’s head at row 4, column 4 is facing UP. Moving UP takes the snake to row 3, column 4, which is empty yet safe. This move allows more flexibility to eventually steer towards one of the apples while maintaining the current safe path. Thus, I choose to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#  H  A#\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  SH A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nSince the snake is already moving to the RIGHT and the cell immediately ahead (row 2, column 5) is free (it’s an empty space), it is safe to continue moving RIGHT. In doing so, the snake will simply move forward without colliding with the wall or itself, preserving its current length (as no apple was eaten) and keeping the gameplay smooth. \n\nThus, my move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#   SHA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake’s head (H) is at row 3, column 6 and is currently moving RIGHT. Directly to its RIGHT, at row 3, column 7, there is an apple (A). Continuing in the current direction (RIGHT) will allow the snake to eat the apple safely. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#   SSH#\n# A    #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nGiven the current board, the snake’s head is at the rightmost position of row 2. Continuing to move RIGHT would cause the snake to hit the wall immediately. Since the snake cannot reverse directions (i.e., cannot go LEFT when moving RIGHT), our alternative moves are UP or DOWN.\n\nLooking at the board, there is an apple positioned in the lower area at row 6, column 6 (inside the board). Moving DOWN from the head’s current position (row 2, column 6) will gradually bring the snake closer to that apple without causing an immediate collision with the wall or the snake’s body. Therefore, the best safe move is to change direction to DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#    SS#\n# A   H#\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board and considering that the snake’s head (located at row 4, column 6) moving in the current direction (DOWN) would advance into an empty cell at row 5, column 6, this move seems safe. It also aligns the head with the apple located at row 7, column 6 in the coming moves. Alternative directions like LEFT or UP do not offer a clear benefit (UP would collide with the body and RIGHT would hit the wall), so continuing in the current direction (DOWN) is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#     S#\n# A   S#\n#     H#\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nI choose to continue moving in the current direction, DOWN. Moving DOWN from H at row 4, column 6 will take the snake to row 5, column 6, which is empty and safe. Furthermore, by moving DOWN, the snake positions itself to potentially eat the apple located at row 6, column 6 in a subsequent move, increasing the score and growing in length. There is no immediate risk of self-collision or hitting a wall, so continuing in the same direction is a good strategic move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A   S#\n#     S#\n#  A  H#\n#     A#\n########\n\nBased on the board state and the snake's current direction (DOWN), the best move is to continue moving DOWN. This move will take the snake's head from its current position (row 5, column 6) to row 6, column 6, where an apple (\"A\") is located. Eating this apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake's length, exactly as intended by the game rules.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A   S#\n#    AS#\n#  A  S#\n#     H#\n########\n\nConsidering the current direction is DOWN, moving DOWN would make the head hit the wall, and moving RIGHT would also hit a wall. Moving UP is not allowed since it would reverse the current direction, plus it would shift the head into its own body. The only safe move is LEFT, which moves the head from (7,7) to (7,6) – an empty space.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#    AS#\n#  A  S#\n#    HS#\n########\n\nGiven the board and rules, the snake’s head is currently at row 6, column 5 and moving left. Checking the possibilities:\n• Moving LEFT from (6,5) takes the head to (6,4), which is an empty space and safe.\n• Moving UP would put the head at (5,5), which is also empty, but since our goal is not only safety but also efficient apple collection, we note that an apple is at (4,5). With the snake currently headed LEFT, continuing that direction maintains the current movement pattern without risking an unintended reversal (the snake cannot turn RIGHT) or hitting the wall (DOWN is blocked by the wall at row 7).\nBy choosing LEFT the snake continues forward safely. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#    A #\n#  A  S#\n#   HSS#\n########\n\nI recommend moving LEFT. Continuing in the current direction allows the snake’s head at (6,4) to safely move to (6,3), which places it one step closer to the nearest apple at (5,3). Moving left keeps the path clear from obstacles and reduces the Manhattan distance efficiently. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n#  HSSS#\n########\n\nBased on the current state, the snake's head is at row 7 (in the board, excluding the border) and the current movement is LEFT. Checking the potential moves:\n• Moving LEFT would put the head at an empty space.\n• Moving DOWN is not possible because the wall is immediately below.\n• Moving UP, however, would move the head to the cell containing an apple (as seen in row 6: \"#  A   #\", where the apple is at column 4 when counting from 1 with the border). \nThus, the best move is UP, allowing the snake to consume an apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#AA    #\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 5, column 3 and is currently moving UP. There is an apple at (4,5), which is closer if we work toward aligning the head horizontally with that apple. Although continuing up is a valid move, turning RIGHT will position the snake closer to that apple, allowing for a more direct approach in upcoming moves while still respecting the rule that the snake cannot reverse its direction.\n\nThus, my move for the current epoch is to change direction to RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#AA    #\n#    A #\n#  SH  #\n#  SSS #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 5, column 4 and the current direction is RIGHT. The available moves (other than the forbidden reverse LEFT and the dangerous DOWN into its body) are to continue RIGHT or turn UP. Aiming for the apple at row 4, column 5, turning UP is a strategic choice because it positions the snake closer (one row above) so that the next move (likely RIGHT) can secure the apple. Therefore, the chosen direction is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#AA    #\n#   HA #\n#  SS  #\n#  SS  #\n########\nI notice that the snake’s head is at row 5, column 5 and there’s an apple immediately to the right at row 5, column 6. Since the snake’s current direction is UP and turning RIGHT is allowed (as it’s not directly reversing), the best move is to turn RIGHT and eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#AA    #\n#   SH #\n#A SS  #\n#  SS  #\n########\n\nMy decision is to change the snake’s route upward so that its head (currently at row 5, column 6) moves closer to the apples in row 4. Moving UP will place the head at row 4, column 6 (an empty square) and will set up future moves to head toward the apple cluster at row 4 (the apple best positioned is at column 3). Continuing in this manner should allow safe navigation and a viable route for apple collection. \n\nAnswer: UP","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#AA  H #\n#   SS #\n#A SS  #\n#  S   #\n########\n\nBased on the board layout and the fact that the snake's head (at row 3, column 5) is closer horizontally to the apple cluster at row 3, columns 1–2, a move to turn left appears the best option. Moving left will start guiding the snake toward these apples, while staying safe from collisions given the current layout, and it’s allowed (since the snake is moving UP, turning left is a valid change).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#AA HS #\n#   SS #\n#A SS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s current direction is LEFT and its head (at row 3, column 4) has three possible moves—continuing LEFT, UP, or DOWN—we analyze our options. Moving DOWN is unsafe because row 4, column 4 contains part of the snake’s body (S), which would result in a collision. Moving UP (to row 2, column 4) is safe but takes the snake away from the nearby apples that are located on row 3 (at columns 1 and 2) and row 5 (at column 1). On the other hand, continuing LEFT moves the snake toward the apples on row 3. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#AAHSS #\n#   SS #\n#A  S  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe best move is to continue heading LEFT so that the snake's head moves onto an apple, increasing the score and length.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#AHSSS #\n#   SS #\n#A  S  #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 3, column 2 and is moving LEFT. Moving left will take the head to row 3, column 1 where there is an apple ('A'). This move is safe (no collision with walls or the snake’s own body) and will immediately increase the score.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Repeating game board:\n########\n#      #\n# A   A#\n#HSSSS #\n#   SS #\n#A  S  #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current board and the snake's position and movement rules, the snake’s head is at (row 3, col 1) and is currently moving LEFT. Moving LEFT immediately would hit the wall because (row 3, col 0) is a wall. Analyzing the alternative moves, both UP and DOWN are viable since neither would result in an immediate collision. \n\nIf the snake moves UP, its head goes from (3,1) to (2,1), which is safe and brings it very close to the apple at (2,2). This creates a good opportunity to grab the apple on the subsequent move. Therefore, the best decision according to the board state is to change direction to UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#HA   A#\n#SSSSS #\n#   SS #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head (H) is located at row 3, column 2, and it’s currently moving UP. However, if we continue moving UP, we’d simply step into an empty space at row 2, column 2. On the other hand, if we steer RIGHT, the head will move into row 3, column 3 where an apple ('A') is placed. Eating that apple will increase the score and grow the snake. Since turning RIGHT is allowed (we cannot reverse direction, but turning RIGHT from UP is valid) and it gives us a beneficial apple, the best move is to turn RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#SH   A#\n#SSSSS #\n#   SS #\n#A     #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is currently at row 3, column 3 and moving RIGHT, the most straightforward and safe move is to continue moving in the RIGHT direction. Moving RIGHT puts the snake’s head into an empty square at row 3, column 4. This move keeps the snake on course toward the apple at row 3, column 7 without immediately risking collision with its own body or the board’s walls. It’s also aligned with the current momentum since the snake isn’t allowed to reverse direction. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#SSH  A#\n#SSSSS #\n#    S #\n#A     #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the situation: The snake’s head is at row 3, column 4 and is moving RIGHT. Looking ahead, moving right from (3,4) leads to (3,5), which is free. The apple on row 3 is at column 7, meaning that by continuing to move right the snake can eventually reach that apple. Turning UP is unnecessary since it doesn’t approach an apple, and turning DOWN would immediately lead to collision with the snake’s own body (as row 4, column 4 is already occupied by a body segment). Thus, the best move is to continue in the current direction, which is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#SSSH A#\n#SSSSS #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head (at row 2, column 4) is currently moving RIGHT, we have to choose a valid move among RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving DOWN would cause an immediate collision with its own body because row 3, column 4 is already occupied by an S. Moving UP would head the snake into an open space at (1,4), but that route does not provide a more direct path to the nearby apple (located at row 2, column 6). Staying in the RIGHT direction will allow the snake to move into the empty square at (2,5), setting up the possibility of reaching the apple on the next move. \n\nTherefore, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#SSSSHA#\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 2, column 5 and is moving RIGHT. One square RIGHT is row 2, column 6 where an apple ('A') is located. Moving RIGHT will cause the snake to eat that apple, grow in length, and get an extra score point. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#     A#\n#SSSSSH#\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nGiven that the current direction is RIGHT, moving directly forward would move the snake head into the wall at (row3, column8). Since the snake cannot reverse direction (i.e., it cannot go LEFT when heading RIGHT), the available choices are UP or DOWN. Checking the board, moving UP from the head's current position at (row3, column7) leads to (row2, column7), where an apple ('A') is located. Eating this apple would increase the score and grow the snake, making UP the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#     H#\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSSSA #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nGiven that continuing UP would result in a collision with the top wall (row 0) and turning RIGHT would also hit a wall (row1, col7), the only safe option is to turn LEFT. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    HS#\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSS A #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nFrom the snake’s head at (1,5) and with the current direction already set to LEFT, the safest and most straightforward move is to continue moving LEFT. Moving UP would immediately hit the wall and moving DOWN would likely lead to a collision with the snake’s own body. Therefore, the best choice is to continue in the current LEFT direction.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#   HSS#\n#SSSSSS#\n#SS  A #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  A   #\n########\nBased on the current game board, the snake’s head is at row1, column4 and is moving LEFT. Turning UP would immediately lead into a wall (row0 is all '#' characters), and turning DOWN would make the head hit its own body (row2, column4 is occupied by 'S'). Therefore, the only safe move is to continue moving LEFT.\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#  HSSS#\n#SSSSSS#\n#S   A #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT and analyzing the board:\n• The head is at row 1, column 3.\n• Moving UP would hit the wall (row 0 is all '#').\n• Moving DOWN would collide with snake body (row 2 has snake segments).\n• Moving RIGHT is a reversal which is not allowed.\nThus, the only safe and legal move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n# HSSSS#\n#SSSSSS#\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board and following the rules, the head of the snake (at row 1, col 2) moving in the LEFT direction can safely continue by moving to row 1, col 1 (an empty space). Other options such as turning UP or DOWN would result in a collision (UP hits the wall; DOWN moves into the snake body). Therefore, the best and only viable move to continue safely is to keep moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#HSSSSS#\n# SSSSS#\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is located at row 2, column 2 and it is currently moving LEFT. However, going LEFT would hit the wall (since row 2, column 1 is a wall). Similarly, turning UP from the current heading would result in hitting the top wall (row 1, column 2). The only legal move available is to turn DOWN. Moving DOWN will take the snake’s head from (2,2) to (3,2) on the board, which is an empty space and safe from collisions with either walls or its own body. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSSSS#\n#H SSSS#\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  A   #\n########\nI choose to move DOWN, as it safely advances the snake toward an apple at (5,1) while avoiding collisions.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SSSSSS#\n#S  SSS#\n#H   A #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 3, column 1. Its current direction is DOWN. If we continue moving DOWN, the snake will move from (3,1) to (4,1), which is a safe empty space. This move sets up the possibility to eventually reach the apple at (5,1) in the following move, so it seems like a good path to eventually gain points while remaining safe.\n\nTherefore, my answer is to keep moving DOWN.\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SSSSSS#\n#S   SS#\n#S   A #\n#H     #\n#A     #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nSince the snake’s current direction is DOWN and moving DOWN from its head at row 4, column 1 will land on the cell in row 5, column 1—which contains an apple ('A')—this move lets the snake eat the apple and grow, thereby increasing the score by one. Therefore, the best move according to the game rules is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSSSS#\n#S   SS#\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at row 5, column 1 and the current movement direction is DOWN, moving DOWN would put the head at (6,1) (an empty cell). However, by checking the adjacent cells, we see that moving RIGHT would lead the head from (5,1) to (5,2), where there is an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake, making RIGHT the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSSSSS#\n#S   SS#\n#SA  A #\n#S     #\n#SH    #\n#  A   #\n########\nI choose to continue moving in the current direction. Moving RIGHT from the head at row 5, column 2 will advance the snake safely into an empty space and set up opportunities to reach an apple later. \nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSSSSS#\n#S    S#\n#SA  A #\n#S     #\n#SSH   #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nConsidering the snake's head is at row 5, column 3 and the current direction is RIGHT, we look for the nearest apple. The apple at row 6, column 3 is just one step away if we move DOWN. Since turning DOWN from RIGHT is allowed (the only forbidden turn would be directly reversing to LEFT), moving DOWN allows the snake to eat the apple safely. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSSSS#\n#S    S#\n#SA  A #\n#S     #\n#SSS   #\n#A H   #\n########\n\nGiven the snake's current direction is DOWN, moving straight down would immediately hit the wall at row 7. Turning right would be safe, but turning left moves the head closer to the apple at (6,1). Since the snake cannot reverse (i.e., cannot choose UP) and we need to avoid collisions while steering toward an apple, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#SSSSSS#\n#S     #\n#SA  A #\n#S     #\n#SSS   #\n#AHS   #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 6, column 2 and is currently moving LEFT. Looking at the neighboring cells:\n• Moving LEFT goes to (6,1) which contains an apple (‘A’), so the snake will eat the apple and increase the score.\n• Moving UP would lead to (5,2), but that cell is occupied by the snake’s body (‘S’), causing a collision.\n• Moving DOWN would head into the wall on row 7.\nTherefore, the best and only safe move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#SSSSSS#\n#S   A #\n#SA  A #\n#S     #\n#SSS   #\n#HSS   #\n########\nAfter analyzing the board and possible moves from the head at row6, column1, I see that continuing left leads immediately into a wall and turning down would also hit a wall. Although moving UP would normally be dangerous because the adjacent cell is occupied by the snake’s body, in many versions of Snake the tail is removed on each move when no apple is consumed. It is possible that the cell above the head (row5, column1) might belong to the tail that is about to be removed, thus offering a chance (even if slim) to stay alive one more epoch. Since reversing direction (RIGHT) is forbidden, I choose UP as the move.\n\nAnswer: UP"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Moving RIGHT will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1. Since eating an apple is desirable and no rules prevent continuing to move in the same direction, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# ASSSH#\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at row 4, column 6 and the current movement is RIGHT, moving RIGHT would place the head into the wall at column 7. Also, because the snake is currently moving RIGHT, it cannot reverse to LEFT. That leaves UP and DOWN as valid options.\n\nLooking at the positions of the apples:\n• Apple at row 1, column 3\n• Apple at row 4, column 2\n• Apple at row 5, column 5\n\nThe apple at row 5, column 5 is the closest (Manhattan distance from head (4,6) is 2) so moving in the DOWN direction would help steer the snake toward that apple. Moving DOWN from (4,6) places the new head at (5,6) which is safe, and then subsequent moves can collect the apple.\n\nThus, the optimal move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A SSS#\n#    AH#\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 6 (counting from the top, starting at 1) and column 7. The snake is currently moving DOWN, meaning it would normally move into row 7. However, the best move is to steer towards an apple if possible. Notice that directly to the left of the head (row 6, column 6) there is an apple. Since turning LEFT is allowed (it is not a direct reversal of DOWN), moving LEFT would let the snake eat the apple and gain a point. Therefore, the optimal direction to choose is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# AASSS#\n#    HS#\n#      #\n########\n\nI analyze the board: The snake’s head “H” is currently at row 6, column 6 (if we index starting at 1 for the rows as shown) and is moving LEFT. Looking at the cell immediately to the left of the head (row 6, column 5), it is empty. Moving LEFT is safe and also positions the snake closer to one of the nearby apples on row 5 (the two apples “AA” found in row 5). Changing direction to UP would lead the snake into its own body (since the cell above (4,5) has a body segment “S”), and moving DOWN would take us farther from the apples. \n\nThus, the best decision is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","The current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# AA SS#\n#   HSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board:\n• The snake’s head is at row 5, column 4 (counting from 0). Its body segments are at (row5, col5), (row5, col6), (row4, col5), and (row4, col6).\n• Apples are located at (row1, col3), (row4, col2), and (row4, col3).\n• The snake is currently moving LEFT. If it continues LEFT, its head will move from (5,4) to (5,3). This move is safe—(5,3) is empty, and it heads in the direction of the cluster of apples (notably the apple at (4,3) is close by).\n• Other possible moves (UP or DOWN) do not immediately bring the head toward an apple as efficiently, and the snake isn’t allowed to reverse direction (i.e. RIGHT is not permitted).\n\nThus, to approach the nearest apple, the best safe move is to keep moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current Game Board:\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# AA  S#\n#  HSSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the snake's current position at row 5, column 3 and its current direction (LEFT), we evaluate the available moves. Continuing LEFT would move the head to (5,2), which is safe but does not yield an apple. However, moving UP would take the snake from (5,3) to (4,3) where an apple is present. Eating the apple will increase the score and grow the snake, making UP the optimal choice. Also, turning UP is allowed (since reversing direction to RIGHT is forbidden), ensuring a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# AH  S#\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n########\nI recommend moving LEFT to eat the apple at (row5, col3) and increase the score while keeping a safe path.\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n# A    #\n# HS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 4, column 2 and the current movement is LEFT. However, one of the apples is located at row 3, column 2 (\"A\" on row 3) which is directly above the head. Since turning UP from LEFT is allowed (it is not directly reversing, which would have been RIGHT), the best move is to turn UP—this will immediately take the snake to the apple’s position, to eat it, increasing our score and growing the snake.\n\nThus, the move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#  A   #\n# AA   #\n# H    #\n# SS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nConsidering the snake’s current direction is UP and its head is located at row 3, column 2, the best move is to continue moving UP. Moving UP from (3,2) will take the snake’s head to (2,2), which contains an apple. This move will safely collect an apple, increase the score by one, and grow the snake's length.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#  A   #\n# HA   #\n# S    #\n# SSA S#\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row2, column2 and moving RIGHT would immediately consume the apple at row2, column3. This increases the score and grows the snake, making it an optimal choice over continuing UP or turning LEFT. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#  A   #\n# SH   #\n# S    #\n#ASSA S#\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head at (2,3) is right below the apple at (1,3). Since the snake currently moves RIGHT, turning UP is a legal move (it isn’t a direct reversal) and will let the snake immediately eat the apple. Therefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n#  H   #\n#ASS   #\n# S    #\n#ASSA S#\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the situation:\n• The snake’s head is at row 2, column 4 and is currently moving UP.\n• Moving UP would immediately hit the wall (row 1 is all walls), which would end the game.\n• The snake cannot reverse direction directly so DOWN is out.\n• That leaves LEFT and RIGHT as viable options.\n• Moving LEFT from (2,4) takes the snake to (2,3), an empty space that safely avoids collisions.\n• LEFT also appears to steer the snake closer to available apples located at (3,2) or (5,2) in subsequent moves.\n\nThus, based on the current board and game rules, the best move is to turn LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# HS   #\n#ASS   #\n# S    #\n#ASSA  #\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe only safe and valid move is to continue moving LEFT. Moving UP would hit the wall and moving DOWN would cause a collision with the snake’s own body. Therefore, based on the current board configuration and rules, the best move is to go LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#HSS   #\n#ASS   #\n# S    #\n#ASSA  #\n#  SSS #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board with the snake's head at (1,1) and its current direction LEFT:\n• Moving LEFT would place the head at (1,0), which is a wall.\n• Moving UP would send the head to (0,1), also a wall.\n• Moving RIGHT is not allowed because it would be a direct reversal of the current LEFT direction.\n• Moving DOWN would move the snake’s head from (1,1) to (2,1). At (2,1) there is an apple ('A'), so this move is both safe and rewards an increase in score.\n\nThus, the best direction is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSS  A#\n#HSS   #\n# S    #\n#ASSA  #\n#  SSS #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the snake’s head is at row2, column1 and the current movement direction is DOWN, we look at the possible moves. Continuing DOWN would take the head to row3, column1. Checking the board, that cell is empty (a safe move), whereas turning LEFT (which for a snake moving DOWN would direct it east to row2, column2) would hit an existing body segment and turning RIGHT (which would mean going west to row2, column0) would hit a wall. Therefore, the only safe and logical direction is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#SSS  A#\n#SSS   #\n#HS    #\n#ASSA  #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake's head is at (row 3, column 1) and the current direction is DOWN, moving down will take the head to (row 4, column 1) where an apple (\"A\") is located. Eating this apple will not only increase the score by 1, but it will also grow the snake. This move follows the rules and is optimal given the board layout.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSS  A#\n#SSS   #\n#SSA   #\n#HSSA  #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nAfter careful analysis of the board and the current direction (DOWN), we see that the snake’s head is currently at row 4, column 1. Moving RIGHT would immediately lead to a collision with its own body at (4,2), and moving LEFT would hit the wall at column 0. Therefore, the only safe move is to continue moving DOWN, which advances the head to row 5, column 1 safely. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#SSS  A#\n#SSS   #\n#SSA   #\n#SSSA  #\n#H S   #\n#      #\n########\n\nI analyzed the situation. The snake’s head is at row 6, column 1, and it’s currently moving DOWN. Looking at the board, there are apples at positions (row 2, column 6), (row 4, column 3), and (row 5, column 4). The apple at (row 5, column 4) seems closest to the head. Continuing in the current direction (DOWN) would move the head to (row 7, column 1), which does not help approach any apple immediately. Instead, if we change direction to RIGHT, the snake’s head would go from (6,1) to (6,2) and then closer in the next moves to that apple. Also, among the allowed moves (remembering the snake cannot directly reverse its direction), RIGHT is the safest and most promising move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSS  A#\n#SSS   #\n#SSA   #\n#SSSA  #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake, currently headed RIGHT from position (6,3), has safe moves available in either RIGHT or DOWN. Moving UP would result in collision with its own body (as row5, col3 already contains an S). Among the safe options, moving RIGHT keeps the current direction and places the head at (6,4), leaving room for planned adjustments to eventually approach the apple at (5,5). Therefore, the chosen direction is RIGHT.\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here’s the current game board as provided:\n########\n#SSS  A#\n#SSS   #\n#SSA   #\n#SS A  #\n#SSH   #\n#      #\n########\n\nConsidering the snake’s head is at row 6, column 4 (in the board row \"#SSH   #\") and it’s currently moving RIGHT, we note that the nearest apple is above, specifically the apple at row 4, column 4 (and another one at row 4, column 3 if you consider the board offset) and the one at row 4, column 4 becomes accessible if we redirect upward. Moving RIGHT would simply go to an empty space with no immediate benefits, and moving DOWN would not direct the snake towards any of the apples. Since the snake cannot directly reverse its direction from RIGHT to LEFT, the best valid option is to steer UP.\n\nThus, changing the snake’s direction to UP will set it on course toward the apple positioned two cells above its current location while keeping the move safe.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#SSS  A#\n#SSS   #\n#SSA   #\n#S HA  #\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 4, column 3 and it is currently moving UP. Moving UP will take the head into row 3, column 3 which contains an apple. Eating the apple will increase the score and grow the snake, so UP is a beneficial move.\nAnswer: UP","########\n#SSS  A#\n#SSS   #\n#SSH  A#\n#S SA  #\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\nBased on the current position of the snake’s head at row 3, column 3 (with rows numbered from 0) and moving in the UP direction, moving UP would result in collision with its body (an 'S' at row 2, column 3), and turning LEFT would also lead to collision (into an 'S' at row 3, column 2). The only safe direction is RIGHT, which takes the head to an empty space at row 3, column 4.\nAnswer: RIGHT","The current game board is:\n########\n#SSS  A#\n#SSS   #\n#S SH A#\n#S SA  #\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake's head ('H') is at row 4, column 4, and the current direction is RIGHT. Notice that directly below the head (row 5, column 4) there is an apple ('A'). By steering DOWN, the snake immediately moves onto the apple, which will grow the snake and increase the score. Moving RIGHT would only advance into an empty space, delaying the benefit of eating the apple. Since turning DOWN is allowed (as it isn’t a direct reversal of the current RIGHT direction), the best move is to go DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#SSS AA#\n#SSS   #\n#S SS A#\n#S SH  #\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnalysis:\nThe snake’s head is currently at row 4, column 4 and the snake is moving DOWN. Looking at the apple positions, the nearest apple is at (3,6) which is to the upper right of the head. Directly moving UP is not allowed since it would be a reversal of the current DOWN direction. Moving LEFT from DOWN would send the head into the snake’s own body (row4, col3 is occupied by 'S'). Thus, turning RIGHT (which is perpendicular and allowed) is the best move. This move will place the head at row4, col5, starting progress toward reaching the apple while avoiding collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here’s the current board as given:\n\n########\n#SSS AA#\n#S S   #\n#S SS A#\n#S SSH #\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the head “H” is located in row 5, column 6 while several apples “A” appear in the upper rows (for example, one apple in row 4, column 7). Although the snake is currently moving RIGHT, it may turn UP since that is a perpendicular turn (and not an immediate reversal). Moving UP from (5,6) takes the head to (4,6), which is empty and positions the snake closer to the apple at (4,7). This choice seems safe because the adjacent cells are not occupied by snake or walls, and it brings the snake nearer to an apple for an immediate opportunity in the following move.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#SSS AA#\n#S     #\n#S SSHA#\n#S SSS #\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\nConsidering the head is at row 3, column 5 and there is an apple immediately to the right at (3,6), the best move is to change direction to RIGHT in order to eat the apple and increase the score.\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSS AA#\n#S     #\n#SASSSH#\n#S SSS #\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\nMy choice is to go UP because moving RIGHT would hit the wall and moving DOWN would take me further away from the apples in row2. Going UP moves the head from row4, col7 to row3, col7, which is safe and appears to guide the snake toward the nearby apples. \nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#SS  AA#\n#S    H#\n#SASSSS#\n#S SSS #\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnalysis:\nThe snake’s head is at row 3, column 7 and it is currently moving UP. If we continue moving UP, the head will move to row 2, column 7, which contains an apple ('A'). Eating an apple will increase the score and grow the snake, which is a good move. Therefore, the best move is to proceed UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#SS  AH#\n#S    S#\n#SASSSS#\n#S SSSA#\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is currently at row 1, column 6 and is facing UP. Moving UP from (1,6) would hit the wall since row 0 is a boundary. Moving RIGHT is also blocked by the wall at column 7. Moving DOWN to (2,6) is possible but doesn’t grab an apple and might lead to a less favorable position considering the snake’s body nearby. However, moving LEFT from (1,6) leads directly to (1,5) where an apple sits. This move will allow the snake to eat an apple and increase the score, with no collision risk. Therefore, based on the current board situation and the movement rules, the best move is to go LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SS  HS#\n#S    S#\n#SASSSS#\n#S SSSA#\n#SSS   #\n# A    #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row2 column6 and its current moving direction is LEFT. If we continue moving LEFT, the head will move into row2 column5, which is currently an empty space. This move is safe because it avoids any walls or collisions with the snake’s own body. Although there are apples on the board (at row4 column3, row5 column7, and row7 column3), moving LEFT now doesn’t immediately create a conflict and keeps the snake in a safe area with options to steer toward an apple later. Therefore, the best move is to keep moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#S  HSS#\n#S    S#\n#SASSSS#\n#S SSSA#\n#SSS   #\n# A    #\n########\n\nLooking at the state, the snake’s head is at row 1, column 4 and it is currently moving LEFT. The square immediately left (row 1, column 3) is empty, and switching to any perpendicular direction (UP or DOWN) does not offer an immediate advantage in reaching an apple while maintaining safety. Going UP would lead directly into the wall, and going RIGHT is blocked by the snake’s own body. Moving LEFT keeps the snake on course toward the closer apple (at row 3, column 2) after a few moves. Therefore, I will keep moving in the current direction.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#  HSSS#\n#S    S#\n#SASSSS#\n#S SSSA#\n#SSS   #\n# A    #\n########\n\nConsidering the snake’s head at (1,3) and the current direction LEFT, moving straight ahead (LEFT) puts the head at (1,2) which is free and does not lead to an immediate collision. Therefore, the best safe move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the given game board:\n########\n# HSSSS#\n#     S#\n#SASSSS#\n#S SSSA#\n#SSS   #\n# A    #\n########\n\nCurrently the snake is moving LEFT. Its head is at cell (1,2) and one move to the LEFT would take the head into cell (1,1) which is empty. (It is not an apple cell and it is not a collision with a wall or its own body.) Therefore, moving LEFT is safe and causes no apple consumption so no growth; the snake’s head moves into (1,1), its former head (1,2) becomes part of its body, and the tail (which we can determine is the only snake body square with a single snake-part neighbor) is removed from the board. (In this board the tail is at (3,1).)\n\nSo the move “LEFT” is a valid safe move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#HSSSSS#\n#     S#\n# ASSSS#\n#S SSSA#\n#SSS   #\n# A    #\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head currently at (1,1) moving LEFT cannot proceed left (that leads directly into a wall), nor go UP (which is also a wall). The only safe move is to change direction to DOWN, moving the head to (2,1) which is an empty space. This move avoids a collision and keeps the snake in play.\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SSSSSS#\n#H    S#\n# ASSSS#\n#  SSSA#\n#SSS   #\n# A    #\n########\n\nFrom the current board, the snake’s head is at row 2, column 1 and it is moving DOWN. Looking at the available moves (it cannot reverse to UP and LEFT would hit the wall), the two legal moves are RIGHT and DOWN. If we continue moving DOWN, the head will move from (2,1) to (3,1), which is an empty space and remains safe. Also, this keeps the current momentum, and on the next move, the snake will be just one cell away from the apple at (3,2). While moving RIGHT is also safe (moving from (2,1) to (2,2)), moving DOWN allows us to maintain the current direction and approach the apple efficiently.\n\nThus, the best move is to continue in the current direction: DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSSSS#\n#S    S#\n#HASSSS#\n#  SSSA#\n# SS   #\n# A    #\n########\nBased on the current game board, the snake’s head is at row 3, column 1 and is moving down.

Eating the apple would increase the score and allow the snake to grow.\nSince eating an apple is the optimal move, the best direction to choose is RIGHT.\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#SSSSSS#\n#S  A S#\n#SHSSSS#\n#  SSSA#\n# SS   #\n# A    #\n########\n\nLooking at the head position at row 3, column 2 (considering the top row as row 0) and the current direction being RIGHT, moving straight would lead the head into (3,3) which already contains part of the snake (an “S”) and would cause an immediate collision. Also, turning directly to the opposite direction is forbidden.\n\nThus, only UP and DOWN are valid choices. Evaluating these:\n\n• UP – The head would move from (3,2) to (2,2). In row 2 (“#S  A S#”), column 2 is empty. Future moves from this position have a promising path: the only safe next move is to (2,3), and that in turn leads directly towards the apple at (2,4). This route looks direct and efficient.\n\n• DOWN – The head would move from (3,2) to (4,2). In row 4 (“#  SSSA#”), column 2 is empty. However, from (4,2) the only safe move next is to (4,1). The path from there eventually may lead down toward the apple at row 6, column 2, but it involves more detours and navigating through tighter spaces.\n\nGiven these options, turning UP appears to be the best choice to safely pursue an apple with a more straightforward route.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#SSSSSS#\n#SH A S#\n#SSSSSS#\n#  SSSA#\n#  S   #\n# A    #\n########\n\nFrom the current position of the head at row 3, column 2 (with the snake moving UP), moving UP would put the head into a segment of the snake (as seen in row 2), and moving LEFT would also result in colliding with its body (row 3, column 1). However, moving RIGHT leads to an empty cell (row 3, column 3), which positions the snake closer to the apple at row 3, column 4. Thus, given the hazards around and the opportunity to get closer to an apple, the best direction to move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSHA S#\n#SSSSSS#\n#  SSSA#\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\nBased on the board, the snake's head is at row3, column3 and facing RIGHT.

From the board, an apple is located at (5,5) which lies downward from the head. Thus, by turning DOWN the snake continues to its natural progression toward an apple while avoiding a direct collision (anticipating that the tail cell it leaves might free up space). \n\nAnswer: DOWN"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Although the apple is below, we cannot immediately reverse from UP to DOWN. By turning LEFT, we can maneuver in subsequent moves to eventually reach the nearby apple at (6,4).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","The current board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at row 5, column 3 and the current direction is LEFT, moving LEFT would continue away from the nearby apples. Instead, turning DOWN moves the head from (row5, col3) to (row6, col3), putting it one step closer to the apple at (row6, col4). In the subsequent move, the snake could then turn right (which would be allowed from a DOWN direction) to directly reach and eat that apple. This sequence of moves maximizes our chances of increasing our score quickly.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# HA   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board and the current movement direction (DOWN), I noticed that if the snake moves RIGHT from its current head position at row 6, column 3, it will land on the apple at row 6, column 4. This move is allowed since the snake’s current direction is DOWN and moving RIGHT is not a reverse move. Eating the apple will increase the score and help grow the snake, making RIGHT the most beneficial move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SH   #\n#  AA A#\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at row 5, column 3 and the current direction is RIGHT, we have the following options: continuing RIGHT (to row 5, column 4) leads to an empty space, whereas turning DOWN will immediately take the snake’s head to row 6, column 3, where an apple is located. Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake’s length. Since turning DOWN is allowed (it isn’t a reversal from RIGHT) and provides an immediate benefit, the best move is to go DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n# SS   #\n#  HA A#\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 7, column 4 (if we count the left wall as column 1) and its body segments are in the row above (row 6). There are three apples on the board: one in row 5, column 6, and two in row 7 (columns 5 and 7). Since the snake is currently moving downward, a move in the same direction would lead into the wall (row 8 is a wall). A move upward would hit its own body (segment in row 6, column 4). Moving left from the head at (7,4) would result in an empty cell, but it doesn’t allow us to eat an apple. However, moving right would move the head from (7,4) to (7,5) where there is an apple, allowing the snake to eat it and grow without collision.\n\nThus, the best move is to turn RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#    A #\n# SS   #\n#  SH A#\n########\nI choose RIGHT because the snake’s head is at row 7, column 4 and, while moving RIGHT continues the current safe path. Moving RIGHT will eventually allow the snake to approach the nearby apple at row 7 column 6. No collisions occur with this move, and it keeps advancing toward the apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#    A #\n#  S   #\n#  SSHA#\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head (H) is located at row 6, column 5 and facing RIGHT, the square directly ahead (row 6, column 6) contains an apple (“A”). By moving RIGHT, the snake will consume the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1 while following all the game rules. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving in the RIGHT direction.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#    A #\n#  S   #\n#  SSSH#\n########\n\nBased on the board, the snake’s head is located at row 7, column 7 and it is currently moving RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would put the head into the wall, and moving DOWN would also collide with the wall. The only safe option is to turn UP, where the cell (6,7) is unoccupied. Therefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#    A #\n#     H#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at (5,6) and is currently moving UP. From (5,6):\n • Moving UP will bring the head to (4,6), which is an empty space.\n • The apple at (3,6) lies directly above (4,6), so continuing UP in subsequent moves should lead to that apple.\n • Turning LEFT would go to (5,5) (a safe cell), but then further adjustments would be needed to reach any apple.\nSince continuing straight (UP) keeps the snake safe and moves it in the direction of one of the nearest apples, the best move is to continue UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#    AH#\n#     S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 4, column 6 and is currently moving UP. The potential moves from this head position are:\n• UP → row 3, column 6, where there is an apple.\n• LEFT → row 4, column 5, where there is also an apple.\nMoving RIGHT would hit the wall and moving DOWN would collide with its own body. Continuing with the current direction (UP) is a safe move that also gets an apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","The current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  A  H#\n#    AS#\n#     S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the head (H) is at row 3, column 6 and the snake is currently moving UP. There are three apples at (2,1), (3,3), and (4,5). The apple at (4,5) is the closest since its Manhattan distance from the head (3,6) is only 2 (|4-3| + |5-6|). However, if the snake continues moving UP, its head would go to (2,6), which moves it farther from the apple at (4,5). Instead, turning LEFT will move the head to (3,5), which brings it immediately adjacent to (4,5) in the next moves and opens up a clear path to eat that apple.\n\nThus, based on safety (avoiding walls and body) and the opportunity to quickly reach an apple, the best move is to go LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  A HS#\n#    AS#\n#     S#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake's head is at (3,5) and is currently moving LEFT. Continuing straight (LEFT) would move the head into an empty space at (3,4). However, turning DOWN from the current direction will move the head from (3,5) to (4,5), where an apple is located. Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake, which is the optimal move in this situation. Since turning DOWN is allowed (it’s perpendicular to the current movement, not a reversal), the best choice is to move DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# AA SS#\n#    HS#\n#     S#\n#    SS#\n########\nMy answer is to turn LEFT, because moving right is fatal (it would collide with the snake's body) and continuing DOWN would steer us further away from the cluster of apples located in the upper left. By choosing LEFT, the snake safely avoids immediate danger and positions itself better to approach an apple in future moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# AA SS#\n#   HSS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n########\nI choose UP because moving upward from the current head position at (4,4) will bring the snake closer to the apples located at (3,2) and (3,3), while avoiding immediate collisions with the walls or its own body. Given the available moves from the current direction (LEFT) – namely LEFT, UP, or DOWN – UP positions the snake better for eventually reaching an apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# AAHSS#\n#   SSS#\n#     S#\n#      #\n########\n\nI recommend turning LEFT. By moving LEFT from the current direction UP, the snake’s head will move from row 4, column 5 to row 4, column 4 where an apple is located. This give us an immediate benefit by eating the apple and increasing the score. It avoids any collisions and adheres to the movement rules.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# AHSSS#\n#   SSS#\n# A   S#\n#      #\n########\nI choose to go LEFT because moving left from the head at row 3, column 3 will bring it directly onto an apple located at row 3, column 2, which increases the score and grows the snake safely.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# HSSSS#\n# A SSS#\n# A   S#\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at row 3, column 2 and the current direction is LEFT, we consider the possible moves. Moving LEFT takes the head to (3,1) which is empty; moving UP goes to (2,2) which is safe as well; but moving DOWN goes to (4,2), where an apple ('A') is located. Since eating an apple not only increases the score but also grows the snake in length—and moving DOWN is allowed (it is not the direct opposite of LEFT)—the best move is to change direction to DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#A     #\n# SSSSS#\n# H SSS#\n# A   S#\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head (H) is at row 5, column 3 and the current direction is DOWN. If we continue moving DOWN, the head will move into row 6, column 3 where an apple (A) is located. According to the rules, eating an apple will increase the score and grow the snake. This move is safe as it does not result in colliding with a wall or the snake’s own body. Therefore, the best move is to continue in the DOWN direction.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#A    A#\n#A     #\n# SSSSS#\n# S SSS#\n# H   S#\n#      #\n########\n\nI'll choose to continue moving in the current direction, which is DOWN. Moving DOWN from the snake’s head (currently at row 5, column 2) leads to an empty space (row 6, column 2) without colliding with any walls or its own body. This maintains safety while the snake maneuvers around the board. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#A    A#\n#A     #\n# SSSSS#\n# S SSS#\n# S    #\n# H    #\n########\n\nGiven the snake’s head is currently at (6,2) and moving DOWN would result in hitting the bottom wall (row 7), a safe alternative is needed. Since the snake cannot reverse from DOWN to UP, the only legal alternatives are LEFT or RIGHT. Moving LEFT takes the head from (6,2) to (6,1), which is an empty space and also positions the snake in a direction more favorable to reach the nearby apples located at (1,1) and (2,1). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A    A#\n#A     #\n# SSSSS#\n# S SS #\n# S    #\n#HS    #\n########\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 7 (line \"#HS    #\"), position 1 (after the wall) and is currently moving LEFT. However, continuing left would cause the snake to hit the wall at column 0. The only safe direction is UP, which will move the snake’s head from row 7 to row 6 at column 1, steering clear of the wall and body. \n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A    A#\n#A     #\n# SSSS #\n# S SS #\n#HS    #\n#SS    #\n########\n\nGiven the snake’s current position and that it's moving UP, the only safe and valid move is to continue moving UP.

The UP move would take the head into row3, column1 which is safely an empty space. In contrast, moving RIGHT or DOWN would immediately hit existing snake body segments and LEFT would hit the wall. Therefore, the optimal move is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A    A#\n#A     #\n#HSSS  #\n#SS S  #\n#SS    #\n#SS    #\n########\nThe best move is to continue moving UP.

Therefore, my answer is to move UP.\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#H    A#\n#S     #\n#SSSS  #\n#SS S  #\n#SS AA #\n#SS    #\n########\n\nAnalysis:\nThe snake’s head is at row 1, column 1 and is currently moving UP.

This move keeps the snake on a safe course toward the apple located further to the right on the same row, and avoids colliding with the walls or the snake’s own body.

By moving RIGHT, the snake aligns closer in the column with the apple (from column 4 to column 5) and can then follow up to reach and eventually eat the apple in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nConsidering the snake's head is currently at row 5, column 5 and its current direction is RIGHT, the most promising move is to change direction to UP to head directly toward the apple at row 3, column 5. Moving UP will start guiding the snake toward that apple, increasing the chance of a quick score while keeping future movement options open.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nBased on the current board and the fact that the snake’s head is at row 3, column 4 and moving UP would take it to row 2, column 4 where an apple is located, the best move is to go UP. This will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length (its former head will become part of the body), and increase the score by one.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# A    #\n#   H  #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board with the snake’s head at (row 2, column 4), moving UP, and with the nearest apple at (row 1, column 2). Continuing UP from (2,4) moves the head to (1,4), which is safe and keeps the snake’s options open. In subsequent moves the snake can turn LEFT to reach the apple. As no immediate apple is available, and moving UP does not risk collision with either the walls or the self, the optimal and safe move for this epoch is to continue in the current direction, UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n# A H  #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is UP, moving straight (UP) would immediately hit the wall (row 0). Also, going DOWN is not allowed because it’s the reverse of UP. That leaves LEFT and RIGHT. The closest apple is in row 1 at column 2 (with the head at row 1, column 4). Changing direction to LEFT will bring the snake closer to that apple. Therefore, the best move is to change direction to LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# AHS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head is at position (row 1, column 3) and it’s currently moving LEFT, the next square in that direction is (row 1, column 2). This cell contains an apple ('A'). By moving LEFT, the snake will eat the apple, grow (its head moves to (1,2) becoming 'H', and the previous head becomes part of its body marked with 'S'), and increase the score by 1. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n# HSS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nAfter evaluating the board, the snake's head at row 2, column 3 is currently moving LEFT. However, moving LEFT would simply take it further away from the apples situated towards the bottom. Turning UP is not viable due to the wall above. Thus, the best move is to change direction and go DOWN, which brings the snake closer to the apples while avoiding collision with the snake's own body or walls.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# SS   #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nI choose to continue in the current direction (DOWN) because moving down is safe and keeps the snake on a valid path toward the apples. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nConsidering the snake’s current position and its downward moving direction, continuing to move DOWN is safe and will eventually help approach the apples. Moving DOWN from (3,2) to (4,2) avoids collisions and maintains progress toward the nearest apple positions. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#   A  #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 4, column 2 (within the inner grid) and its current direction is DOWN. If the snake continues moving DOWN, its head will move into (row 5, column 2), which is an empty space. Although none of the apples is immediately adjacent, moving DOWN keeps the snake safe and allows flexibility in later moves toward the apples located at (row 5, column 4), (row 6, column 3), and (row 6, column 5). Also, turning LEFT from its current direction would move it farther away from the apples, and turning RIGHT is an alternative but not significantly faster in reaching any apple compared to continuing in the current safe direction. Therefore, the most straightforward and safe choice is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# H A  #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board: the snake’s head (H) is at row 5, column 2 and its body extends upward. There are apples at row 5, column 4 and row 6 (columns 3 and 5). Since the snake is currently moving DOWN, it cannot move UP, but it can turn LEFT or RIGHT, or continue moving DOWN. Moving RIGHT from (5,2) takes the head to (5,3), which positions it one step away from the apple at (5,4), making it easier to consume on the next move. Thus, the optimal move is to turn RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# SHA  #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe best move is to continue moving in the current direction (RIGHT) so that the snake’s head moves onto the apple at row6, column4. This will let the snake eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by one.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# SSH  #\n#  A A #\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 5, column 4 and is currently moving RIGHT. None of the immediately adjacent squares in the allowed movement directions (UP, RIGHT, or DOWN) contain an apple, so a safe move is required. Continuing in the current direction (RIGHT) will move the head to (5,5), which is empty. This move maintains safety without colliding with the wall or the snake’s body, and it also sets up the potential to reach the apple at row 6, column 5 in future moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SSSH #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 5, column 5 (inside the walls) and is currently moving RIGHT. Checking the adjacent cells, if the snake continues moving RIGHT it will simply move into an empty cell. However, if it turns DOWN from its current position, the new head position would be at row 6, column 5, which contains an apple (\"A\"). Since turning DOWN is allowed (it isn’t a reversal of the current RIGHT direction) and eating an apple increases the score and grows the snake, the best move is to go DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#ASSSS #\n#  A H #\n########\n\nGiven the snake’s head is at (row 6, column 5) and the snake is moving DOWN, moving further DOWN would make it hit the wall at row 7. Meanwhile, the apple located at (row 6, column 3) is just two spaces to the left. Moving LEFT will bring the snake closer to that apple and keep it safe. Therefore, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A SSS #\n#  AHS #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is currently at (row6, col4) and is moving LEFT. By moving left from (6,4), the snake will reach (6,3) where there is an apple. This move is safe and also gains a point by eating the apple, while maintaining the current allowed direction (the snake cannot reverse its direction, so moving LEFT is the valid continuation). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A SSSA#\n#  HSS #\n########\n\nConsidering the current direction is LEFT, let's check possible moves. Moving UP from the head at (6,3) would lead to (5,3) which is currently part of the snake, and moving DOWN would lead into the wall. The only safe option is to continue moving LEFT, which will move the head to (6,2) and avoid collisions while keeping the possibility to reach one of the nearby apples. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  SSA#\n# HSSS #\n########\n\nI choose to move UP, as it takes the head from position (7,3) upward to (6,3), which sets up an opportunity to reach the nearby apple at (6,2) on the following move. This avoids a potential dead‐end that could result from continuing LEFT. \n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AH  SA#\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row6, column2 and is currently moving UP. There are three apples on the board:\n• One at row2, column5.\n• One at row6, column1.\n• One at row6, column6.\n\nThe closest apple is the one to the left of the head (row6, column1) with a Manhattan distance of 1. Since the snake isn’t allowed to reverse direction (i.e. it cannot go DOWN when moving UP), turning LEFT is legal and safe. Furthermore, moving LEFT from (6,2) will place the head on the apple at (6,1), which will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake.\n\nThus, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#HS  SA#\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board. The snake’s head is at row6, column2 and is moving LEFT. Continuing LEFT would immediately hit the wall (# at row6, col1), so that’s not an option. The available turns are UP or DOWN. Moving UP from (6,2) to (5,2) seems preferable because it gets the head closer to the apple at row3, column4 (Manhattan distance 4) compared to the alternatives. Thus, my decision is to go UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#H     #\n#SS   A#\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nI choose to move RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#SH    #\n#SS   A#\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board:\n• The snake’s head (H) is at row 4, column 2 (if we index rows starting from 0 at the top), and the current direction is RIGHT.\n• If we continue moving RIGHT, the head will advance to (4,3), which is empty.\n• Other potential moves are UP or DOWN; however, moving DOWN would go to (5,2), where part of the snake's body lies, causing a collision. Moving UP is safe as well, but it would change the current direction.\n• Continuing to move RIGHT maintains the current momentum and safely avoids obstacles, while still positioning the head closer to the apple at (2,3) (or the other apples on the board) in subsequent moves.\n\nThus, the best move is to continue RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here's the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#SSH   #\n#SS   A#\n# SS   #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at row 5, column 4 and the nearest apple is located at row 3, column 4 (which is two squares upward), the best strategy is to steer the snake in the UP direction. This will eventually let the snake reach the apple safely without risking collision with itself or the walls, keeping in mind that a direct reversal (i.e. LEFT) is forbidden when moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n#  H   #\n#SSS   #\n#SS   A#\n# S    #\n########\n\nExamining the board, the snake’s head is at row 4, column 3 (if we count starting with the top row as row 1) and the current direction is UP. Moving UP from (row 4, col3) places the head at row 3, col3, which contains an apple ('A'). Eating an apple is beneficial since it increases the score and grows the snake.

Moving UP from the current head position to (row2 - 1, col3) is safe and it sets up the snake to reach that apple in the following moves (a subsequent RIGHT move can take it closer to the apple). Also, turning LEFT or RIGHT doesn’t provide an immediate advantage toward the nearest apple, and since the snake’s current direction is UP (and it cannot reverse direction), the best move is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#  H A #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#SSS A #\n#SS   A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is currently at (row 1, col 3) and is moving UP. Moving UP would result in hitting the top wall since row 0 is all walls, and reversing to DOWN is not allowed. Between turning LEFT (to (row 1, col 2)) and RIGHT (to (row 1, col 4)), moving RIGHT is favorable because it directs the snake toward the apple at (row 1, col 5). Thus, the best move is to turn RIGHT.\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#  SHA #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#SSS A #\n#S    A#\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current state, the snake’s head is at row 2, column 5 and is moving RIGHT. Directly to the RIGHT (row 2, column 6) is an apple. Moving RIGHT will let the snake eat the apple, gain a score, and extend its length. This move is also valid because the snake is not allowed to reverse direction (and RIGHT is the current direction already). Therefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n#  SSH #\n#  S   #\n#A S   #\n#SSS A #\n#S    A#\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board with the snake’s head at row1, column5 and the current direction RIGHT, we notice that one apple is positioned at row4, column5 – directly beneath the head’s column. Moving DOWN will bring the snake closer to that apple in a straight-line path (from (1,5) to (2,5), then eventually to (4,5)), while avoiding walls and the snake’s own body. Note that “UP” would mean colliding with the wall at row0, and “LEFT” is not allowed from RIGHT since the snake cannot reverse its direction. Therefore, the best move is to turn DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#  SSS #\n#  S H #\n#A S   #\n#SSS A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\nBased on the position of the snake’s head at row 2, column 5 and its current moving direction “DOWN,” the most direct and safe move to get closer to an apple (specifically, the apple at row 4, column 5) is to continue moving DOWN. This will bring the snake closer to the apple in the next steps while avoiding collisions. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n#  SSS #\n#  S S #\n#A S H #\n# SS A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 3, column 5 and it is moving DOWN. The DOWN neighbor of the head (i.e. at row 4, column 5) contains an apple (A), so moving DOWN will let the snake eat the apple, increasing its score and length without any collision. Since reversing direction isn’t allowed (i.e. cannot go UP) and LEFT or RIGHT don’t offer an immediate benefit, the best move here is to continue going DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Let's first repeat the current game board:\n\n########\n#  SSS #\n#  S S #\n#A S S #\n# SS H #\n# A   A#\n#      #\n########\n\nNow, looking at the board, the snake’s head (H) is at row 4, column 5 (if we use a 0-indexed scheme with the first row being row0). The snake is currently moving DOWN so the head’s next position if it continues DOWN would be at (5,5) – an empty space. However, there is an apple at (5,6) which is only one cell to the right from the head’s current column and then one step down. Moving DOWN would not immediately put us closer to that apple, but a turn to the RIGHT from the current head’s position would put the head at (4,6), which is directly adjacent to the apple and positions us well to take it in the subsequent move.\n\nSince turning RIGHT is allowed (because snake cannot reverse, meaning moving UP is forbidden when moving DOWN; LEFT and DOWN remain valid but RIGHT is the best way to approach the nearest apple), the best move is to change direction to RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#  SSS #\n#  S S #\n#A S S #\n#  S SH#\n# A   A#\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake is currently moving RIGHT and its head is at row 5, column 7, moving further RIGHT would hit the wall (cell at row 5, column 8 is a wall). Also, the snake is not allowed to reverse its direction, so it cannot go LEFT. Looking at the potential moves, if the snake goes UP, the new head position would be at (row 4, column 7), which is empty. However, going DOWN takes the head from (row 5, column 7) to (row 6, column 7) where there is an apple. Eating the apple is beneficial because it increases the score and grows the snake, making it the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#  SSS #\n#  S S #\n#A SAS #\n#  S SS#\n# A   H#\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board the snake’s head is at row 5, column 6 (if we index rows from 0 to 7), and it is moving DOWN. Moving RIGHT would hit the wall, and switching to UP is not allowed since that reverses the direction. Moving LEFT is safe, but continuing DOWN moves the snake into an empty cell (row 6, column 6) without risk. Continuing in the current direction (DOWN) is the simplest and safe option.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#  SSS #\n#  S S #\n#A SAS #\n#    SS#\n# A   S#\n#     H#\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is DOWN, we cannot reverse to UP, and moving DOWN or RIGHT would immediately result in a collision with the wall. The only safe move is to go LEFT, which also directs the snake toward one of the remaining apples. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#  SSS #\n#  S S #\n#A  AS #\n#    SS#\n# A   S#\n#    HS#\n########\n\nBased on the board layout and the fact that the snake’s head (currently at row 6, column 5) is moving LEFT with the cell immediately to its left (row 6, column 4) being free, the safest and most natural continuation is to maintain the current LEFT direction. This move will keep the snake on a clear path and set up potential maneuvers toward nearby apples (for example, the apple at row 3, column 4 or the apple at row 5, column 2) while avoiding walls and its own body.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#  SSS #\n#    S #\n#A  AS #\n#    SS#\n# A   S#\n#   HSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board with the snake’s head currently at row 6, column 4 and its current moving direction LEFT, we need to decide safely how to continue while potentially approaching one of the apples. The immediate cells around the head are:\n\n• LEFT from (6,4): moves to (6,3) which is empty.\n• UP from (6,4): moves to (5,4) which is also empty.\n• RIGHT from (6,4): is not allowed because it would be a reverse of the current direction.\n• DOWN from (6,4): moves into the wall.\n\nBoth moving LEFT and UP are safe moves. However, looking at the apple positions on the board—notice apples at (3,1), (3,4), and (5,2)—choosing UP may give the snake a quicker route toward the apple at (5,2) in the near future. By moving up, the snake can later adjust its direction (for example, turning left) to easily reach that apple.\n\nThus, my move is to change the snake’s direction to UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","The current game board is:\n########\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#A  AS #\n#    SS#\n# A H S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake's head (H) is in row 6, column 4 and it is currently moving UP. By continuing the UP direction, the snake will move into row 5, column 4, which is empty. Continuing that path, it will approach the apple located in row 4, column 4. This move seems safe and beneficial since it leads directly to an apple without risking collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#A  AS #\n#   HSS#\n# A S S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nMy move is to continue going UP, which will allow the snake to eat the apple located at row 4, column 5 and safely grow in length without colliding with a wall or itself.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#A  HS #\n#   SSS#\n# A S S#\n# A SSS#\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 4, column 5 and is currently moving UP. Moving right would result in a collision since row 4, column 6 is already occupied by its body. Continuing upward would not take the snake any closer to the nearest apple at row 4, column 2. Changing direction to LEFT would start guiding the snake toward that apple. Therefore, based on safety and the goal to collect apples, the best move is to turn LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#    S #\n#A HSS #\n#   SSS#\n# A S S#\n# A SSS#\n########\n\nI recommend the snake keep moving LEFT. Moving left from the current head position at (3,3) to (3,2) is safe. It positions the snake to eventually reach the apple at (3,1) on subsequent moves, while avoiding collisions. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#AHSSS #\n#   SSS#\n# A S S#\n# A SSS#\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at the 'H' in row 4, column 2 (if we count starting at index 1 after the left wall) and the current direction is LEFT, the immediate cell to its left (row 4, column 1) contains an apple ('A'). Moving LEFT will safely collect that apple, increase the score, and allow the snake to grow. Since turning directly right (the reverse of LEFT) is not allowed and moving UP or DOWN does not appear as advantageous as obtaining a bonus apple, the best choice is to continue with LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#HSSSSA#\n#   SSS#\n# A S S#\n# A SSS#\n########\n\nGiven that the snake's head is at (row3, col1) and the current direction is LEFT, moving directly left would hit the wall. Between UP and DOWN, both moves are safe. However, by choosing DOWN the snake will head toward the apples located at (row5, col2) and (row6, col2), which seems promising for increasing the score. Therefore, the best move is to go DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Let's first repeat the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#SSSS A#\n#H  SSS#\n# A S S#\n# A SSS#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board:\n• The snake’s head is at row 4, column 1 (in the string \"#H  SSS#\").\n• The current movement direction is DOWN.\n• Moving DOWN from (4,1) brings the head to the cell at row 5, column 1, which is empty.\n• This move safely progresses the snake toward the nearby apple at row 5, column 2.\n• It also avoids immediate collision with walls or snake body segments, so continuing downward is a sound choice.\n\nThus, the best move on this turn is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#SSSS A#\n#S  S S#\n#HA S S#\n# A SSS#\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is currently at row 5, column 1 and moving DOWN would lead it to an empty space (row 6, column 1). Notice that the cell to the RIGHT of the head, at row 5, column 2, contains an apple. Since turning RIGHT (from DOWN) is allowed (it is not directly reversing), the optimal move is to turn RIGHT, eat the apple, grow the snake, and increase the score.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT, the snake’s head moves into the cell with the apple, becoming 'H', and the previous head position becomes part of the body ('S'). No tail is removed because the snake grows upon eating an apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#SSSS A#\n#S  S S#\n#SH S S#\n# A SSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is located at row 5, column 2 (with columns and rows counted from the top-left, starting at 0) and is currently moving RIGHT. The legal moves from RIGHT are UP, RIGHT, or DOWN (the snake cannot reverse to LEFT). Notice that if we move DOWN from (5,2) the snake’s head will go to row 6, column 2 where there is an apple. Eating an apple is beneficial as it increases your score and grows your snake without risking a collision. Therefore, choosing DOWN is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#SSSS A#\n#S  S S#\n#SS S S#\n# H SSS#\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 6, column 2 and its current movement is DOWN. Moving DOWN would immediately hit the wall, and moving UP is not allowed because that would reverse its direction. Both LEFT and RIGHT are possible, but if we check the surroundings, going RIGHT to (6,3) is safer since the square above (5,3) is free, which can later help in approaching the closer apple at (1,2). In contrast, moving LEFT to (6,1) would lead to (5,1) on the next move where a body part is present. Therefore, the best move is to go RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#SSSS A#\n#S  S  #\n#SS S S#\n# SHSSS#\n########\n\nBased on the board and the fact that the snake's head (at row 6, column 3) cannot move RIGHT (that cell is occupied by its own body), LEFT (also body) or DOWN (would hit the wall), the only safe move is to go UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#SSSS A#\n#S  S  #\n#SSHS  #\n# SSSSS#\n########\n\nGiven the snake’s head is located at row 6 (counting from 1) at the 'H' position and is currently moving UP, the safest and most logical move is to continue moving in the same direction. Moving LEFT or RIGHT would cause immediate collision with its own body, and reversing to DOWN is not allowed. Therefore, the best move is to keep moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#SSSS A#\n#S HS  #\n#SSSS  #\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nAnalysis:\nThe snake’s head is located at row 5, column 4 (in the board \"#S HS  #\"). Its current moving direction is UP; however, moving UP would lead the head to row 4, column 4 where there is a snake body segment ('S'), which would cause a collision.\n\nChecking the adjacent moves from the head:\n• UP: row 4, col 4 → collision with 'S'\n• RIGHT: row 5, col 5 → collision with 'S'\n• DOWN: row 6, col 4 → collision with 'S'\n• LEFT: row 5, col 3 → empty cell\n\nThus, the only safe move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#SSSS A#\n#SHSS  #\n#SSSS  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at (row 4, column 2) and its current movement is LEFT, the three allowed directions are LEFT, UP, and DOWN. Checking the adjacent cells:\n• LEFT from (4,2) goes to (4,1), which is occupied by a snake body part.\n• UP from (4,2) goes to (3,2), again a body part.\n• DOWN from (4,2) goes to (5,2), also occupied by the snake.\n\nIn a typical snake game move (unless an apple is eaten), the snake moves by adding a new head and simultaneously removing its tail. The only safe move into an occupied square is if that square is currently the tail (so it will be vacated shortly). In this board it appears that none of the three adjacent cells is the tail cell.\n\nAs a result, every possible move (LEFT, UP, or DOWN) will force the snake into a body collision, meaning the game is inevitably over. When no safe move exists the usual strategy is to continue in the current direction. Therefore, I will choose to go in the current direction: LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

If the snake continues moving UP, it will move into an empty space. However, there is an apple immediately to the RIGHT (at row 4, column 4). Since turning RIGHT from UP is allowed and would allow the snake to eat an apple immediately (thereby increasing the score and growing the snake), the best move is to change direction to RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current board and the snake's position, the snake’s head (H) is at row 4, column 4 while its body (S) is at row 4, column 3. Since the snake’s current direction is RIGHT, it normally would continue moving to row 4, column 5 if no input is given. However, there is an apple at row 5, column 4. By changing direction to DOWN (which is a valid direction as it is not the reverse of RIGHT), the snake can immediately move from (4,4) to (5,4) and consume that apple, increasing the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#  A A #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the game board and current conditions, the snake’s head is at (5,4) and the current moving direction is DOWN. The available moves (besides UP, which is prohibited as it would be a reverse move) are LEFT, RIGHT, or continuing DOWN. Moving DOWN would take the snake farther away from the apples, which are located in the upper part of the board at (1,3), (1,5), and (2,5). By moving RIGHT, the snake positions itself in a column adjacent to two apples (at columns 5), which could potentially set up a more favorable path toward collecting them in subsequent moves. This reasoning makes RIGHT the best option.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#  A A #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n########\nI choose UP because it steers the snake toward the apples above, particularly heading toward the apple at row3 col6.

Moving UP from the current head position at row 4, column 6 will land the snake on row 3, column 6, where an apple is located. This move is safe and will increase the score while causing the snake to grow, so the optimal direction is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#  A A #\n# A  H #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP, we check the move in that direction. The head is at row2, col5; moving UP will bring it to row1, col5. Looking at the board, row1, col5 contains an apple ('A'). By moving UP, the snake will immediately eat an apple, increasing the score by one and growing in length without colliding with a wall or itself. Therefore, the best move is to continue UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#  A H #\n# A  S #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nI choose to turn LEFT. The snake head at row 2, column 6 is moving UP, but that would lead into the wall. Turning LEFT moves the head to row 2, column 5, a safe move and brings it closer to the apple at row 2, column 4. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#  AHS #\n# A  S #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\nI choose to continue with the current direction, LEFT. Moving left from the head's position (row 1, column 4) will lead the snake to the apple at row 1, column 3, which will increase the score and grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#  HSS #\n# A  S #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nI choose to continue moving in the same direction – LEFT. From the snake’s head at (1,3), moving left to (1,2) keeps you in a safe empty space and positions you well for reaching the nearby apple at (2,2) in the following move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# HSSS #\n# A  S #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nThe optimal move is to go DOWN: moving down from the head at (1,2) will eat the apple at (2,2) and increase the score, while maintaining a safe position.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# SSSS #\n# H  S #\n#  A S #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n########\nI choose to continue in the current direction, which is DOWN. Moving down from the head’s current position (row 2, col 2) to (row 3, col 2) keeps the snake safe and sets up the possibility to turn toward the nearby apple at (row 3, col 3) in the following moves.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# SSSS #\n# S  S #\n# HA   #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nConsidering the snake’s current direction is DOWN and its head is at row 4, column 3, note that the cell to its RIGHT (row 4, column 4) contains an apple. Turning RIGHT is allowed (since the snake cannot reverse from DOWN to UP, but turning RIGHT is a valid move) and will let the snake eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score. Therefore, the best move is to turn RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# SSSS #\n# S  S #\n# SH   #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n# AA   #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 3, column 3 and is currently moving RIGHT. There are apples positioned further down (one located at row 5, column 3 and two on row 6). In order to get closer to an apple, moving DOWN would be the best choice because that would quickly bring the head closer to (or directly into) an apple’s line of travel without risking collision with the snake’s own body or the wall. \n\nThus, my answer is:\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# SSSS #\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n#  H   #\n#  A   #\n# AA   #\n########\n\nBased on the current direction (DOWN) and the board layout, moving DOWN will take the snake's head from the current position (\"H\") on the fifth row into row six, where there is an apple (\"A\"). This move will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by one. Since the apple is immediately in the snake’s path when moving DOWN, and this move does not cause any collision with the snake’s body or the board walls, the optimal move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n# SSSS #\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n#  S  A#\n#  H   #\n# AA   #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board: The snake’s head (H) is at row 5, column 3 and its current direction is DOWN. Moving DOWN takes the snake to row 6, column 3, where an apple (A) is located. Eating the apple will increase the score by 1 and extend the snake, which is beneficial. There are no hazards (walls or snake body) in that direction, so the best move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n# SSSS #\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n#A S  A#\n#  S   #\n# AH   #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the situation:\n• The snake’s head (H) is at row 6, column 3 (if we count rows and columns starting at 0).\n• The snake is currently moving DOWN, but going DOWN would move the head into the bottom wall (“########” in row 7), ending the game.\n• Looking at the adjacent squares, turning LEFT would move the head to row 6, column 2, which contains an apple (“A”). This is a beneficial move that will not result in a collision and will increase the score.\n• The snake cannot reverse direction, so the only safe and advantageous option is to move LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#ASSSS #\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n#A S  A#\n#  S   #\n# HS   #\n########\n\nReviewing the board, our snake’s head is at row 6, column 2 and is currently moving LEFT. Moving LEFT from (6,2) puts the head into (6,1), which is an empty space and safely avoids collisions with both the wall and its own body. Other possible safe move would be UP, but going LEFT aligns with the current direction and brings the head slightly closer to the apple at (4,1). Since turning RIGHT is not allowed (reversing direction) and going DOWN would collide with the wall, the optimal move is to continue LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#ASSS  #\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n#A S  A#\n#  S   #\n#HSS   #\n########\n\nThe only safe move is UP because continuing LEFT would hit the wall, DOWN would hit the wall, and RIGHT is not allowed (reversing the current direction). Thus, the snake should go UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n#ASS   #\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n#A S  A#\n#H S   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head (H) is at row 5, column 1 and is moving UP. Directly above the head at row 4, column 1 there is an apple ('A'). Moving UP will immediately make the snake eat this apple, increasing the score by 1 and allowing the snake to grow. This move is both safe and beneficial as it gets us closer to our goal.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#ASS   #\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n#H S  A#\n#S S   #\n#SSS A #\n########\n\nConsidering the head at row 4, column 1 and the current direction UP, moving UP takes the snake to row 3, column 1. That square is free (it’s not a wall or a snake body) and is in the general direction of the nearest apple at row 1, column 1. Other options – turning LEFT would hit the wall and turning RIGHT does not immediately help reach an apple – are less favorable. Therefore, the optimal decision is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#AS    #\n# S    #\n#HSS   #\n#S S  A#\n#S S   #\n#SSS A #\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake's head is at row 4, column 2 and is currently moving UP. Moving UP would take the head to row 3, column 2, which is a safe empty space. Turning LEFT would result in hitting a wall, RIGHT would result in collision with its own body, and reversing direction (DOWN) is not permitted. Therefore, the optimal move is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A     #\n#HS    #\n#SSS   #\n#S S  A#\n#S S   #\n#SSS A #\n########\n\nI analyze the board: The snake's head (H) is at row 3, column 2, and it's currently moving UP. Moving UP takes the head to row 2, column 2 where there's an apple (A). Picking UP will immediately eat an apple, growing the snake and increasing the score by one.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#H     #\n#SS    #\n#SSS   #\n#S S  A#\n#S S   #\n#SSS AA#\n########\n\nCurrently, the snake’s head is at row 1, column 1 and is moving UP. Continuing UP would take the head into the top wall (row 0), and turning LEFT would hit the wall on the left (column 0). Although turning DOWN is not allowed because it directly reverses the current UP direction, the only valid and safe option is to turn RIGHT. This move will advance the snake to row 1, column 2, which is free and does not result in collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SH    #\n#S     #\n#SSS   #\n#S S  A#\n#S S   #\n#SSS AA#\n########\n\nConsidering that the snake’s head is at (1,2) moving RIGHT and the upcoming space (1,3) is empty, the most natural and safe continuation is to keep moving straight ahead. Continuing RIGHT avoids an immediate collision and still moves the snake toward the clusters of apples in the lower right portion of the board.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n#SSH   #\n#S     #\n#S S   #\n#S S  A#\n#S S   #\n#SSS AA#\n########\n\nThe head is on row 1, column 3 and the snake is moving RIGHT. Looking at the board, both moving RIGHT and DOWN are legal options. However, UP would hit the wall and LEFT is not allowed since the snake cannot reverse its direction.\n\nMoving RIGHT takes the head from (1,3) to (1,4). That square is empty and it keeps the snake moving in the current direction toward the apples located in the lower-right area (one apple at row 4, column 6 and two apples at row 6, columns 5 and 6). Continuing in the same direction seems safe right now, and it offers a straightforward path until you can change course to approach an apple later.\n\nThus, the best move at this moment is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSSH  #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S S  A#\n#S S   #\n#SSS AA#\n########\nI will move RIGHT since the snake’s head is at row 2, column 5 and moving right into column 6 is safe. The cell ahead is empty, not an apple but it continues the safe trajectory. Moving UP is not allowed because of the wall, and moving DOWN is safe but does not offer immediate advantages. Thus, continuing RIGHT is the optimal decision.\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSSSH #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#S S   #\n#SSS AA#\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at (row1, column5) and is currently moving RIGHT. The available legal moves (without reversing) are RIGHT or DOWN (since UP would lead into the wall). Considering the apple positions (one near (row4, col6) and others in row6) and aiming to reduce the Manhattan distance toward the nearest apple, moving DOWN from (1,5) to (2,5) brings the snake closer (moving from a distance of 4 to 3) while avoiding immediate wall hazards. Therefore, the best move in this position is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSSS #\n#S   H #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#S     #\n#SSS AA#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 2, column 5 and the current moving direction is DOWN. Continuing in that direction appears safe since moving DOWN from (2,5) takes the head to (3,5), which is empty. Eventually, moving further down will let the snake reach the apple at (6,5) on row 6. There are no imminent collisions or dangers when going DOWN, and it is in line with the current movement. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSSS #\n#S   S #\n#S   H #\n#S    A#\n#S     #\n#SS  AA#\n########\n\nI analyzed the board. The snake’s head is at row 3, column 5 and the closest apple is at row 4, column 6. Continuing in the current direction (DOWN) moves the head from (3,5) to (4,5), which brings it only one step away (horizontally) from the apple. This path is safe and sets up reaching the apple in the next move. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSSS #\n#S   S #\n#S   S #\n#S   HA#\n#S     #\n#S   AA#\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is currently at row5, column6 and the apple lies immediately to its right at row5, column7. Continuing the current DOWN direction would move to an empty square, and moving LEFT or UP would either not reach an apple or result in a collision with the snake’s own body. Therefore, the optimal move is to change direction to RIGHT, which will consume the apple, increase the score, and cause the snake to grow.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S   S #\n#S   S #\n#S   SH#\n#S A   #\n#S   AA#\n########\n\nGiven that the snake is currently facing RIGHT and the head is at row 5, column 7, moving RIGHT would immediately collide with the wall. Also, reversing direction (i.e. LEFT) is forbidden. Checking UP and DOWN, we see that moving DOWN from (5,7) brings the head to row 6, column 7 – an empty cell. More importantly, this move positions the snake one step away from the apples at row 7, columns 6 and 7, so the snake can eat an apple in the following move. Therefore, moving DOWN is the optimal and safe choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSSS #\n#S   S #\n#S   S #\n#S   SS#\n#S A  H#\n#    AA#\n########\n\nGiven the snake’s head is at row 6, column 7 and the current direction is DOWN, moving DOWN will take the snake’s head to row 7, column 7, where an apple ('A') is present. Eating the apple will increase the score and extend the snake’s length. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S   S #\n#S   S #\n#S   SS#\n#SAA  S#\n#    AH#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 7, column 7 and the current direction is DOWN. Moving DOWN would immediately hit the wall (row 8 is all walls) and moving RIGHT would also result in a collision with the wall. Moving UP is not allowed because that reverses the current direction (from DOWN to UP) and would lead to a collision with the snake’s own body in row 6, column 7. The only safe and rewarding move is to turn LEFT, which takes the snake to row 7, column 6 where an apple is located. That move both avoids collision and increases the score.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S A S #\n#S   S #\n#S   SS#\n#SAA  S#\n#    HS#\n########\n\nBased on the game state, the snake’s head is at (6,5) and moving LEFT will take it from (6,5) to (6,4), which is an empty cell. Since continuing in the current direction is safe and there is no immediate apple at the next cell (thus avoiding any collision risk), I choose to move LEFT. After moving, the head will shift to (6,4), the old head becomes a body segment, and the tail (the oldest segment at (5,1)) will be removed.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#SSSSS #\n#S A S #\n#S   S #\n#S   SS#\n# AA  S#\n#   HSS#\n########\n\nI’ve examined the board and the position of the snake’s head at (6,4) along with the position of nearby apples. Since the snake is moving LEFT and turning UP is also allowed (but RIGHT isn’t, as that would be a reversal), one safe and promising option is to continue moving LEFT. Although no apple is immediately available by turning UP or continuing straight, moving LEFT keeps the snake in a safe area and positions it to reach the apples (for example, by turning UP on the following move to get the apple at (5,3)). Therefore, my chosen move is to go LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here's the current game board:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S A S #\n#S   S #\n#    SS#\n# AA  S#\n#  HSSS#\n########\n\nI evaluated our options from the current head position (row 6, column 3) and current direction LEFT. Moving left (to row 6, column 2) would simply continue with an empty square. However, turning UP (to row 5, column 3) would land the snake directly on an apple (as row 5, column 3 is occupied by an 'A'), which increases the score and grows the snake. Moving DOWN would hit the wall. Since turning UP is both safe and beneficial, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S A S #\n#S A S #\n#    SS#\n# AH  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nEvaluating the options from the head’s current position (row 6, column 3) and with the snake moving UP, we see that the cell immediately to the left (row 6, column 2) contains an apple ('A'). Moving LEFT will allow the snake to immediately eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length—all while following the rule that the snake cannot reverse direction (since LEFT is a valid turn from UP). Therefore, the optimal move is to turn LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#SSSSS #\n#S A S #\n#S A S #\n#   ASS#\n# HS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nBased on the board layout and the positions of the apples (notably around row3, row4, and row5) compared to the head’s current location (row6, column3) and considering that the Manhattan distances toward the nearest apples are shorter if we move upward, I decide that moving UP will steer us closer to an apple (for instance, the apple at row5, column5 or even the ones above). Therefore, the best move to pursue growth and score is to change direction to UP.\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S A S #\n#  A S #\n# H ASS#\n# SS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, we see that the snake’s head is at row 4, column 2 and the current moving direction is UP. Looking at the cells adjacent to the head, the cell above (row 3, col 2) is empty, the cell to the left (row 4, col 1) is empty, and the cell to the right (row 4, col 3) is empty as well. Notably, there is an apple at (row 4, col 4) which is directly to the right of the head’s vicinity.\n\nBy moving RIGHT, the snake will position itself directly next to the apple in the same row, enabling it to potentially eat the apple on the next move and increase the score. Additionally, this turn is valid because it is not the reverse of the current direction (DOWN would be disallowed, but RIGHT is safe). Therefore, to move toward a closer apple while avoiding obstacles, the optimal move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSSSS #\n#  A S #\n#  A S #\n# SHASS#\n# SS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here’s the given game board:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#  A S #\n#  AAS #\n# SSHSS#\n# SS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the situation, the snake’s head is at row 4, column 4 and it is currently moving RIGHT. One of the nearest apples is located directly above the head (row 3, column 4 is an apple). Changing direction from RIGHT to UP is a legal move (the snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT wouldn’t be allowed) and will secure the apple and increase the score. Therefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#  A S #\n# AAHS #\n# SSSSS#\n# SS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at row 3, column 4. Since the snake is currently moving UP, if it were to continue moving UP, it would move into (2,4), which is empty. However, if we turn LEFT, the head moves to (3,3), where there is an apple ('A'). Eating an apple not only increases the score but also grows the snake. Moving RIGHT would result in the snake hitting its own body (cell (3,5) contains 'S'), and turning DOWN is not allowed because the snake cannot reverse its direction.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to turn LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#  A S #\n# AHSS #\n# SSSSS#\n# SS  S#\n# ASSSS#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board: The snake’s head (H) is at row 3, column 3, and the current direction is LEFT. Moving LEFT from (3,3) will take the snake to (3,2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake without causing any collision.

Its left neighbor (row 4, column 2) is empty, while the upward cell (row 3, column 3) is also free. Moving down would result in a collision since row 5, column 3 is occupied by part of the snake. Furthermore, the rule prohibits reversing its direction, so RIGHT is not allowed.

Since the snake is currently moving UP, and it cannot reverse direction, the allowed choices are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. LEFT is immediately blocked by the wall at (2,0), and moving UP leads to an empty space at (1,1) that does not advance toward the nearby apple.

The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#A SH  #\n#A S  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Among the three apples on the board, the apple at (row 1, column 3) is the closest in terms of Manhattan distance. Since the apple is directly above the head, continuing in the UP direction will eventually put you in position to eat it. Also, with a snake length of 1 there’s no risk of self-collision, and moving UP remains safe with respect to the walls.\n\nThus, the best move for this turn is to keep moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current state, the head (at row 4, column 4) is aligned vertically with the apple at (row 2, column 4). Continuing in the UP direction will move the snake closer to that apple. Since the snake is already moving UP and no obstacles block that path, the best move is to keep moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#A A   #\n#  H  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nMoving UP from the current head position at row 2, column 3 will move the snake to row 1, column 3, where there is an apple. This move will allow the snake to eat an apple and increase the score, making it the optimal decision. \n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#A HA  #\n#  S  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nConsidering the current snake head at row2, column4 and its upward direction, moving UP would hit the wall. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is not allowed). Between LEFT (moving to an empty cell at row2, column3) and RIGHT (moving to row2, column5 where there's an apple), the best move is to go RIGHT to immediately eat the apple and grow. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current board:\n########\n#A SH  #\n#A S  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is RIGHT and the snake’s head is at the 'H' in row 2 (fourth column), moving RIGHT makes the head advance to the next empty cell (row 2, column 6 in a 1-indexed view or (1,5) in a 0-indexed internal view). There is no apple immediately to the right but this move is safe – it won’t violate the no-reversal rule and avoids wall or self-collision. Moving RIGHT also positions the snake in the proper trajectory to eventually approach the apple that is further to the right (the one in row 3, near column 6).\n\nThus, the next move is to continue in the RIGHT direction.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here's the current game board:\n########\n#A SSH #\n#A    A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board: the snake’s head (H) is currently at row 2, column 5 (using 0‐indexed columns within the row, where walls occupy the first and last positions), and the snake is moving RIGHT. The adjacent cell ahead to the RIGHT (row 2, column 6) is empty and safe. Turning UP would cause an immediate collision with the top wall, and reversing to LEFT is not allowed. Moving DOWN is safe too, but continuing RIGHT positions the snake to eventually turn DOWN in a subsequent move to reach the apple at row 3, column 6. Given the current safe and natural continuation, the best move is to keep moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the repeated game board:\n########\n#A  SSH#\n#A    A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 1, column 6 and it is moving RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would hit the wall (cell at row 1, column 7 is '#') and moving UP would also hit a wall (row 0 is all walls). The only safe move is to change its direction to DOWN, which will move the head to row 2, column 6 where there is an apple. This will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow, and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#A  SSS#\n#A    H#\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current board and snake’s position—with the head at row 3, column 7 and moving DOWN—the closest apple is located at (row 5, column 6). Moving DOWN from (3,7) puts the head at (4,7), which is safe and sets up a subsequent opportunity to turn toward that apple. Therefore, continuing in the current direction (DOWN) is a prudent choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#A   SS#\n#A    S#\n#     H#\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 3, column 6 and is currently moving DOWN. Moving RIGHT would immediately hit the wall because the right cell is a border, and turning UP is not allowed since that would be reversing the current direction (DOWN to UP). That leaves LEFT and DOWN. Although the apple at (row 4, column 5) is one move diagonally from the head, continuing in the current direction (DOWN) puts the snake closer to that apple (the new head would be at row 4, column 6) without risking a collision, and then a next turn LEFT can grab the apple. For these reasons, the recommended move is to continue with the current direction.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#A    S#\n#A    S#\n#     S#\n#    AH#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the board, the snake’s head is at row 5, column 7 (if we count starting at 1 for the top left corner, it appears on the 5th row in the board provided) and is currently moving DOWN. There is an apple immediately to its left (at row 5, column 6), which makes it a great opportunity to eat the apple and grow. Since the snake cannot reverse direction (and reversing from DOWN would be UP), but moving LEFT is allowed, the best move is to change direction to LEFT so that the head moves into the apple’s cell.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#A    S#\n#A    S#\n#     S#\n#  A HS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nI choose to continue moving in the current direction (LEFT). Moving left from the head’s current position at row4, column5 will move the head into an empty space at (4,4). Although there isn’t an apple immediately, this move safely positions the snake so that on the following epoch it can reach the apple at (4,3), while avoiding collision with the walls or its body. This is in accordance with the rules and safe gameplay.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#A    S#\n#     S#\n#  AHSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is located at row 4, column 4 (within the grid where the first row is row 0). The snake is currently moving LEFT and cannot reverse direction. Moving LEFT means the head will advance from (4,4) to (4,3). At position (4,3) there is an apple ('A'). This move will safely collect an apple, which increases the score by one and causes the snake to grow in length without any immediate collision issues.\n\nThus, the best move is to continue LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#A    S#\n# A   S#\n#  HSSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nI recommend continuing in the current direction, which is LEFT, to safely progress toward the apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","The current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#A     #\n# A   S#\n# HSSSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is currently at row 4, column 2 and is moving LEFT. However, if instead of continuing LEFT (which would take the head into an empty space at (4,1)), we turn UP, the head will move from (4,2) to (3,2) where there is an apple. Eating that apple will increase the score and grow the snake, which is beneficial.\n\nSince turning UP is allowed (changing direction from LEFT to UP is not a reversal) and it brings the snake directly onto an apple, the best move is to change direction to UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","The current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#A     #\n# H A S#\n# SSSSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 4, column 3 and it is currently moving UP. However, one of the nearest apples is on the same row at column 5. By turning RIGHT from the current direction, the head would move from (4,3) to (4,4). In the next epoch, a RIGHT move would then bring the head onto (4,5) where an apple is located, allowing the snake to grow and increase its score. Moving UP would simply place the head at (3,3), which is an empty space—and although safe, it delays grabbing an apple. Therefore, RIGHT is the best move to eventually secure an apple sooner.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#A     #\n# SHA  #\n# SSSSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the board and rules, the snake’s head is currently at row 3, column 3 moving RIGHT; the cell immediately to the right (row 3, column 4) contains an apple. By moving RIGHT, the snake will eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length (the head moves to (3,4) while the former head becomes a body part, and the tail does not move). This is a beneficial move, so I will choose RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n# SSH  #\n# SSSSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving RIGHT and its head (H) is at row 4, column 5, the next move in the RIGHT direction will move the head into the cell at row 4, column 6. That cell is empty so no apple is eaten and the snake does not grow. In a standard snake move the new head is placed in the target cell while the tail (the oldest segment) is removed. Based on the assumed ordering of the snake’s segments, the tail (which was at row 5, column 7) will be removed, and the former head (row 4, column 5) becomes a body segment (S).\n\nAfter the move, the board updates as follows:\n\n• Row 4 originally was: \n   \"# SSH  #\"\n  It becomes: \n   \"#\" followed by a space, then the previous body at col3 ('S'), at col4 ('S'), at col5 now becomes a body ('S'), at col6 the new head ('H'), then a space at col7, and finally the wall at col8.\n  So row 4 becomes: \"# SSSH #\"\n\n• Row 5 originally was:\n   \"# SSSSS#\"\n  It now loses its tail at col7, so with snake cells at col3–col6 remaining, it becomes:\n   \"# SSSS #\"\n\nOther rows (rows 2, 3, 6, and 7) remain unchanged.\n\nThus the new game board state will be:\n\n########\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n# SSSH #\n# SSSS #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince our chosen move is to continue RIGHT, the final answer is as follows.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n# SSSH #\n# SSSS #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake is currently moving RIGHT and cannot reverse (so LEFT is invalid), we have three possible moves: RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. Moving DOWN would have the snake’s head go to (row5, col6), which is currently occupied by the tail. Although moving into the tail is safe in cases when the tail is about to move, this option doesn’t steer the snake toward the apple cluster in the upper left (apples at row2 and row3). Moving RIGHT would simply carry the head closer to the wall without any immediate benefit. Moving UP, on the other hand, takes the snake’s head to (row3, col6), a safe empty space that better positions the snake for subsequent leftward moves to approach the apples.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to change direction and go UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#AA    #\n#A   H #\n# SSSS #\n# SSS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the apples are on the left side (at positions (1,1), (1,2), and (2,1)) and our snake’s head is at (2,5) moving UP, it makes sense to start steering left so that you can eventually move toward and consume the apple at (2,1). Moving UP (continuing the current direction) would take you to an empty cell at (1,5) and further away from the apples. While RIGHT would not help either since it directs the snake further away from the apples, switching direction to LEFT is both safe and aims toward a nearby apple. Note that with the snake’s current length, turning left now should not result in any collision, and this change of direction keeps you on a safe path. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","The current game board is:\n########\n#AA    #\n#A  HS #\n# SSSS #\n# SS   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 2, column 4 and is currently moving LEFT. The space immediately to the left (row 2, column 3) is empty. Other potential moves—such as UP—could be considered, but turning DOWN would lead directly into the snake’s body and RIGHT is not allowed since the snake cannot reverse direction. Staying on course (LEFT) keeps the snake safe while moving it toward the cluster of apples in the upper left part of the board.\n\nThus, the best move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let's first restate the current game board and information:\n\n########\n#AA    #\n#A HSS #\n# SSSS #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 21\n\nNow let’s analyze the situation. The snake’s head is located in row 3 at the position marked by ‘H’ (at approximately column 4). The current direction is LEFT, meaning if we continue moving LEFT the head will advance one cell to the left (from column 4 to column 3). Checking row 3, column 3, we see that cell is empty (a space) and safe. There is an apple positioned in row 3 at column 2, which we could aim for in subsequent moves. (Note that turning UP would take the head to row 2, column 4 – which is also open – and DOWN would immediately collide with a body segment, making it an invalid move. Also, reversing by going RIGHT is not allowed.) \n\nGiven that continuing LEFT keeps the snake safe and moves it closer to an apple on its left, the optimal move in this epoch is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#AA    #\n#AHSSS #\n# SSSS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head at row 2, column 2 moving LEFT would go to row 2, column 1 where an apple ('A') is located. This move not only follows the current direction but also guarantees that the snake eats an apple, increasing the score. Therefore, the best move is to continue LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#AA    #\n#HSSSS #\n# SSSS #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nAfter evaluating the moves from the current head position (row2, col1), moving LEFT would result in a collision with the wall. However, turning UP moves the head to row1, col1 where an apple is present while remaining within the board boundaries, thereby increasing the score. Moving DOWN is safe too, but it misses the opportunity to eat an apple. In snake games, eating an apple is beneficial because it increases your score and the snake’s length. Therefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#HA    #\n#SSSSS #\n# SSSS #\n#      #\n# A  A #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe only safe move that avoids a collision while allowing the snake to consume an apple is to move RIGHT (from (2,2) to (2,3), where there is an apple).

The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

The available moves (without reversing) are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Checking the apple positions:\n• There is an apple at row6 (near the bottom) at column2 (“#A     #”) which is the closest in Manhattan distance.\n• The other apples at row2 and row3 are farther away.\n\nEven though the closest apple is found “down” from the head, the snake cannot directly reverse from UP to DOWN. However, by turning LEFT the snake can then later maneuver toward that apple; from (5,4) turning LEFT leads to (5,3), and on subsequent moves the snake can adjust its course (for example turning DOWN) since from LEFT a direct reversal (RIGHT) is the only forbidden change. Thus, turning LEFT is a safe move that sets the snake on a favorable path toward the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# H    #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\nI choose to continue moving LEFT so that the snake can quickly align with the apple at (5,1) in the subsequent move.\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#H     #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board. The snake's head is at row 5, column 2 (inside the walls). Its current direction is LEFT, which means it cannot immediately reverse and go RIGHT, and going LEFT would hit the wall. Moving UP would be safe but doesn't yield a benefit. However, moving DOWN leads to row 6, column 2, where there is an apple. Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake. Thus, the best move is to go DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#A   A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current situation, the snake's head is at row 5 column 1 and the only valid moves are continuing straight (DOWN) or turning RIGHT—turning LEFT would make it hit the wall and UP is not allowed as it reverses direction. Moving DOWN moves the head to row 6 column 1, which is safe. Although no apple is consumed this move, it is a secure move that avoids collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#A   A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#S     #\n#H     #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 6, column 1 (inside the walls) and currently moving DOWN. If it continued going DOWN, the head would move into the wall at row 7 (since row 7 is entirely walls), causing a collision. Moving LEFT from (6,1) would also hit the wall (column 0 is a wall). Therefore, the safe option is to move RIGHT, which moves the head from (6,1) to (6,2) into an empty space.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#A   A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#SH    #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board: The snake’s head is at row7, column3 and it is currently moving RIGHT. The only legal directions are RIGHT (continue moving) or UP (since moving DOWN would hit the wall and LEFT is not allowed because it reverses the current direction). By moving UP the snake will start moving toward the higher rows where the apples are located, which is more promising for eventually eating an apple. So I choose to change direction from RIGHT to UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here's the current game board:\n########\n#A   A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n# S    #\n########\n\nI choose to continue moving UP. This keeps the snake safe and moves it in the general direction of the closest apple at (row2,1) over subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#A   A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# H    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the board:\n• The snake’s head is at row 4, column 2 and it is moving UP.\n• The nearest apple is at row 1, column 1.\n• Continuing in the current direction (UP) moves the head from (4,2) to (3,2), which is a safe move that brings the snake closer to the apple.\nThus, the best move is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n#A   A #\n#     A#\n# H    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at row 4, column 3 and the current movement is UP, continuing in the UP direction moves the head into row 3, column 3, which is safe. This move also keeps the snake on course toward the nearest apple (at row 2, column 2) with only a minor adjustment (a subsequent left turn could then secure that apple). Therefore, I’ll continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#A   A #\n# H   A#\n# S    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the board, the head is at position (2,2) and the nearest apple is at (1,1) with a Manhattan distance of only 2. Continuing in the current UP direction will place the head at (1,2), which is just 1 move away from turning left toward the apple in subsequent epochs. Given that moving straight maintains our current momentum without risking an immediate collision, the optimal move is to keep moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#AH  A #\n# S   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is currently at position (row1, col2) and moving UP. However, if the snake continues moving UP, its head will hit the wall on row0. We cannot go DOWN because that would be a direct reversal of the current UP direction. Turning RIGHT would move to an empty cell at (row1, col3), but turning LEFT leads to (row1, col1) where an apple ('A') is located. Eating an apple increases our score and tail growth, so the best move is to go LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#HS  A #\n# S   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nConsidering the snake's head is at (1,1) and the current direction is LEFT, moving left would hit the wall because (1,0) is a boundary. Also, the snake cannot reverse direction (i.e., move RIGHT). The only safe alternatives are UP and DOWN, but UP would move the head into the wall at (0,1). Thus, the only valid and safe move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SS  A #\n#H    A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nI choose RIGHT because the snake's head (currently at row 3, column 2) moving RIGHT will bring it closer to the apple at row 3, column 7 while avoiding collision with its own body or the surrounding walls. This maneuver looks optimal considering the current board layout and movement restrictions.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n#S   A #\n#SH   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nExamining the board, the snake’s head is at row 2, column 2 and it’s currently moving RIGHT. The cell immediately to its RIGHT (row 2, column 3) is empty. Moving in the current direction (RIGHT) is safe and keeps the snake alive. Therefore, I choose to continue in the RIGHT direction.\n\nAfter making this move, the snake’s head will move from (2,2) to (2,3). The previous head becomes part of the snake’s body and the tail will shift accordingly (the tail cell at (1,1) will be cleared), so the snake remains at length 3. No apple will be eaten in this move since (2,3) is blank.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#SSH  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake's head is at position (2,3) and it is currently moving RIGHT, the most natural and safe move is to continue moving in the same direction. This will bring the snake closer to the apple at (2,6) while avoiding any collisions with its own body or the walls.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n# SSH A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nMy move is to continue moving in the current direction (RIGHT). By moving RIGHT from the head at row2, column4, the snake will advance into an empty cell at row2, column5. This move sets up the snake to reach the nearby apple at row2, column6 on the upcoming turn without risking collision. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#  SSHA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board and noticed that the snake’s head (H) is at the sixth cell of the third row, currently moving RIGHT. Directly to the right of the head is an apple ('A'). By continuing in the RIGHT direction, the snake will move into the apple square, eat the apple, increase its score by 1, and grow in length. This move is valid according to the game rules and maximizes the score gain.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#    A #\n#  SSSH#\n#A     #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at position (2,6) moving right. Moving RIGHT would immediately hit the wall at (2,7), so that option is invalid. Comparing the UP and DOWN moves, moving UP to (1,6) is preferable because it brings the snake closer to the apple at (1,5). Thus, the best move is UP.\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#    AH#\n#   SSS#\n#A     #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the snake’s current head position at (row1, col6) and the current direction UP, the only move that avoids hitting a wall is to move LEFT. Moving LEFT will bring the head to (row1, col5) which contains an apple, allowing the snake to eat it, increase its score, and grow in length. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#    HS#\n#   SSS#\n#A     #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT, we need to choose a move that avoids colliding with walls or the snake’s own body. The snake head is at row 2, column 6 and moving left will take it to row 2, column 5, which is an empty space. Turning UP would lead to row 1, column 6, a wall, and turning DOWN would put the head on part of its body. Therefore, the best (and only “safe”) option is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#   HSS#\n#    SS#\n#A     #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board and given that the snake’s head is at the fourth column of the second row and is moving LEFT, we must choose a move that avoids a collision with the wall or snake’s own body while steering toward the apples in future turns. Moving UP would immediately result in hitting the wall. Changing direction to RIGHT is not allowed as it would be a reversal of the current direction. Although turning DOWN is a viable option, it does not offer an immediate safe continuation, since the snake is already aligned safely when moving left. Continuing to move LEFT moves the snake into an empty cell (position (1,3)) and keeps options open for future maneuvers toward the apples. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#  HSSS#\n#     S#\n#A     #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the snake’s head is at row 1, column 3 and its current direction is LEFT, moving one square to the left (to row 1, column 2) puts the head on an empty space and avoids collisions with its body or the walls. This move is safe and leaves options open for approaching one of the apples later. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# HSSSS#\n#      #\n#A     #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board, the snake's head located in the second row (positioned at the 'H') is currently heading LEFT. Continuing in that direction will move the head into an empty space (the cell immediately to its left), keeping the snake safe while preserving opportunities to steer toward the nearby apples in the coming moves. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#HSSSS #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT, but moving left would immediately hit the wall. Moving UP is also not an option because the head would hit the top wall. The only safe move is to choose DOWN, making the snake’s head move into an empty space. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSS  #\n#H     #\n#A     #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\nDOWN\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#S A   #\n#H     #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake is currently moving DOWN and its head (\"H\") is at the beginning of row 4, moving DOWN will take it to row 5 where there is an apple (\"A\"). Eating the apple increases the score and is a safe move because there’s no collision with the snake’s own body or walls.

Moving from the head’s current position at (row 4, column 1) to (row 5, column 1) is safe since that cell is empty. This move avoids any self-collision and also keeps our options open for redirecting toward the nearby apple later. Therefore, my chosen move is DOWN.\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSS   #\n#SAA   #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#H    A#\n#      #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the situation: The snake’s head is at position (5,1) and the current moving direction is DOWN. Since the snake cannot reverse, UP is not allowed and LEFT would immediately run into the wall (# at column 0). Moving DOWN would shift the head to (6,1), a blank space. However, a move to the RIGHT would take the head from (5,1) to (5,2), which is also safe. Considering the position of the apple in the same row (at (5,6)) and the opportunity to head in that general direction, turning RIGHT brings the snake closer to the apple while still preserving safety.\n\nThus, the best move is to turn RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#SS    #\n#SAA   #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SH   A#\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the snake's current head position at row 5, column 2 and its current direction being RIGHT, moving right to position (5,3) is safe since that cell is empty.

This move will advance the snake’s head one square to the right (from column 3 to column 4 in row 6), heading toward the apple at column 6. It is a safe move and brings the snake closer to an apple, helping to increase the score and grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#SAA   #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SSSH A#\n#      #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board and the snake’s current position and movement (currently going RIGHT), I find that continuing RIGHT is the best move. Moving RIGHT will advance the head from (6,5) to (6,6), keeping a clear path so that the apple at (6,7) is easily reached in the next move. Moving UP or DOWN does not bring us any closer to an apple and risks complicating the snake’s path. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","The current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n# AA   #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SSSSHA#\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head is at (6,6) and the current direction is RIGHT, moving RIGHT will cause the snake to enter the cell (6,7) where there is an apple. Eating the apple increases the score, and the snake grows (the head moves to (6,7) and the previous head becomes a body segment, without moving the tail). Therefore, the optimal move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAfter the move, the board will update as follows:\n- The old head at (6,6) becomes a body segment.\n- The apple at (6,7) is replaced by the new head.\nThus, row 6 changes from \"#SSSSHA#\" to \"#SSSSSH#\".\n\nIn summary, the move that makes the snake eat an apple is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n# AA   #\n#S  A  #\n#S     #\n#SSSSSH#\n#      #\n########\nI choose to move UP so that the snake avoids colliding with the wall by not going RIGHT and heads in the direction of the apples.\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n# AA   #\n#   A  #\n#S    H#\n#SSSSSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake is currently moving UP and its head is at row 4, column 6, moving straight ahead (UP) would take the head to row 3, column 6.

Also, although there is an apple at row 3, column 4, choosing UP positions the snake closer to that apple in subsequent moves without risking an immediate collision. As the snake cannot reverse direction and turning RIGHT would hit the wall while turning LEFT wouldn’t offer any immediate advantage over going UP, the optimal move is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n# AA   #\n#   A H#\n#     S#\n#SSSSSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the current direction is UP and the snake’s head is at (3,6), there are two safe moves: UP (moving to an empty space at (2,6)) and LEFT (moving to (3,5)). The RIGHT move would hit a wall, and the snake cannot reverse direction by going DOWN. By choosing LEFT, the head gets closer to the apple at (3,4) (only two moves away), making it a more advantageous move.

The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs.

The three apples are located at positions (2,5), (3,5), and (5,2). The closest apple is at (5,2), reachable by steering left first (position (4,2)) and then later turning downward to get the apple. Moving UP would simply take the snake to an empty space at (3,3) without progressing toward any apple. Similarly, turning RIGHT would not help as much in reaching the nearest apple. Therefore, the best move is to steer LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let's first repeat the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n# H    #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnalysis:\n• The snake’s head 'H' is on row 4, column 2.\n• There is an apple 'A' directly below, on row 5, column 2.\n• Since the snake is currently moving LEFT (and it cannot reverse to RIGHT), it is allowed to change its direction to either UP or DOWN.\n• Moving DOWN will immediately bring the snake’s head from (4,2) to (5,2) and allow it to eat the apple, thus increasing the score by 1 and growing in length.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nConsidering the snake’s current head position at row 5, column 2 and its current movement direction being DOWN, the closest apple appears to be located at row 6, column 4. Moving DOWN from the current head position will bring the snake closer vertically to that apple while also keeping the move safe. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H A  #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board. The snake’s head is at row 7, column 3. Since the current direction is DOWN, if the snake continued its motion it would hit the wall on row 8. Reversing is not allowed, so the only legal turns are LEFT and RIGHT. The apple on row 7 is at column 5 – turning RIGHT will move the head closer to that apple. Therefore, the best move is to turn RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SHA  #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving RIGHT and its head is at (row6, col3) with the nearby apple located at (row6, col4), moving RIGHT will immediately allow the snake to eat the apple. Eating the apple will increase the score and grow the snake by one, while safely not colliding with any walls or itself. Therefore, based on the current board and game rules, the optimal move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#   AA #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SSH  #\n########\n\nGiven that the current direction is RIGHT and the snake cannot immediately reverse its direction (which would be LEFT), the valid moves are RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. Moving DOWN would immediately lead the snake to hit the wall at the bottom, so that isn’t safe. Staying to the RIGHT would move the snake’s head into an empty space in the same row as its tail, but it wouldn’t bring the snake any closer to the apples, which are located in the upper part of the board (rows 2 and 3). By turning UP, the snake advances toward the cluster of apples while avoiding collisions. Therefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#   AA #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#  SS  #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board: the snake's head is at row 5 (column 4) moving UP and the apples are located in the upper part of the board. Continuing UP is both legal (no reverse direction) and eventually leads the snake closer to one of the apples. Therefore, after reviewing all possible safe moves, the best move is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#   AA #\n#    A #\n#   H  #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n########\n\nBased on the current position and direction (UP), the best move is to continue moving UP.

The snake’s head is at row 2, column 4 and is currently moving UP. Noticing that there is an apple at (row 2, column 5) to the right of the head, turning RIGHT will allow the snake to move directly into the apple. This is a safe move since it doesn’t reverse the current UP direction and it scores by eating an apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#   SH #\n# A SAA#\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n########\n\nConsidering the current head position at row 2, column 5 and the current direction RIGHT, the possible moves are UP, RIGHT, or DOWN (since the snake cannot reverse its current direction).

If the snake continues moving DOWN, it will move to (4,5), which is empty. However, there is an apple at position (3,6), so if we turn RIGHT the head would move to (3,6) and immediately eat the apple, increasing the score and growing the snake. Turning LEFT would result in colliding with the snake’s own body, and moving UP isn’t allowed since that would be a direct reversal of the current direction.

Since the snake cannot reverse its direction (so LEFT is not allowed), the remaining safe options are UP or DOWN. Evaluating these two options shows that moving DOWN brings the snake closer to the apple at (6,1) (in addition to the ones on row 4) by reducing the Manhattan distance (from (4,6) to (6,1): 1+5=6) compared to UP.

However, after moving RIGHT the options to maneuver upward are blocked by nearby snake body parts, whereas moving LEFT opens an upward path (for example, from (5,3) to (4,3)) toward the apples, one of which is located not too far away (for instance, apple at row 3, column 2 or row 2, column 3). \n\nThus, the best move to avoid collision and steer toward an apple is to turn LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#S A A #\n#SA    #\n#S  SSS#\n#S HS S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nConsidering the board, the snake’s head is currently at row 5, column 3 and it is moving LEFT. However, going left would just move into an empty space without immediately approaching any apple. On the other hand, changing direction to UP is allowed (since a 90° turn is permitted) and would bring the snake closer to the nearby apple at (3,2) as well as the apple located at (2,3). Moving UP (to row 4, column 3) is safe since that cell is empty. Thus, to maximize chances at eating an apple and increasing the score without risking an immediate collision, the best move is to change direction to UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#SSS   #\n#S A A #\n#SA    #\n#S HSSS#\n#S SS S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nBased on the current board and the rules, the snake’s head is at row 4, column 3 and its current direction is UP. Moving UP will take the head from (4,3) to (3,3), which is a free space (not a wall or snake body) and safe for the current move. Although there is an apple at (3,2) nearby, continuing upward now keeps the snake safe and leaves the option to turn left on the following move to get the apple. Therefore, the best decision at this epoch is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#SS    #\n#S A A #\n#SAH   #\n#S SSSS#\n#S SS S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nI will choose to move UP. When the snake moves from (3,3) to (2,3), it lands on an apple ('A'), which increases the score and grows the snake. This move is legal and optimal given the current board state and the current direction (UP).\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SS    #\n#S H A #\n#SAS   #\n#SASSSS#\n#S SS S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nConsidering the head is at row2, column3 and the snake is currently moving UP, a safe and strategic move is to turn RIGHT. This will position the head at row2, column4, setting up a direct approach toward the apple at row2, column5 in the following move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#S     #\n#S SHA #\n#SAS   #\n#SASSSS#\n#S SS S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nI analyzed the board: the snake’s head is at row3, column5 and is moving RIGHT. Directly to the right (row3, column6) there’s an apple ('A'). Moving RIGHT will allow the snake to eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and grow the snake without causing any collisions. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current board as provided:\n########\n#S A   #\n#S SSH #\n#SAS   #\n#SASSSS#\n#S SS S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at row 2, column 5 (0-indexed with walls around the edges) and it is currently moving RIGHT. There are apples on the board at row 1, column 3, row 3, column 2, and row 4, column 2.\n\nMoving directly RIGHT would take the head into an empty cell at (2,6), but eventually this would bring the snake dangerously close to the wall (column 7) and force a turn. Meanwhile turning DOWN from (2,5) would move into (3,5), but that path makes it hard to reach any of the apples since the snake’s body occupies key spaces in row 3 (for example, cell (3,3) is taken).\n\nOn the other hand, turning UP from (2,5) moves the head to cell (1,5) where there is no snake body, and from that upward position the snake can later move left to grab the apple at (1,3). This appears to be a safe and strategic move that steers the snake toward an apple while avoiding immediate danger.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#  A H #\n#S SSS #\n#SAS   #\n#SASSSS#\n#S SS S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nGiven the current board and that the snake’s head is at row 1, column 5 with its current moving direction UP, we must avoid going UP because that would result in a wall collision. Also, reversing direction (i.e., going DOWN) is not allowed. Between the remaining safe moves, LEFT and RIGHT, moving LEFT brings the snake closer to the apple located at row 1, column 3. Therefore, the best move according to the game rules and the board state is to move LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#  AHS #\n#  SSS #\n#SAS   #\n#SASSSS#\n#S SS S#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\nMoving LEFT will immediately allow the snake to eat the apple at (1,3). Since the snake is already moving LEFT, continuing in that direction is both legal and beneficial. This move increases the score and grows the snake, so it is the optimal choice.\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#  HSS #\n#  SSS #\n#SAS   #\n#SASSSS#\n#S SSAS#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 1, column 3 and is currently moving LEFT. Checking the options from its head position:\n• Moving UP would collide with the top wall.\n• Moving DOWN would result in a collision with its own body (the square at row 2, column 3 is occupied by an S).\n• Moving RIGHT is not allowed because it would be a direct reversal of its current LEFT direction.\nThus, the only safe move is to continue moving LEFT into an empty square (row 1, column 2).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# HSSS #\n#  SSS #\n# AS   #\n#SASSSS#\n#S SSAS#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\nBased on the current board, the snake’s head is at position (1,2) and is moving LEFT. Moving UP would lead into the wall, and RIGHT is not allowed because it’s the reverse of LEFT. Moving LEFT would take the snake head to (1,1), which is safe but doesn’t head toward any apples. Moving DOWN, however, takes the snake head to (2,2), which is an empty cell that is closer to the apple at (3,2). Therefore, I choose the DOWN direction.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# SSSS #\n# HSSS #\n# AS   #\n# ASSSS#\n#S SSAS#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head is at (row 2, column 2) and the current direction is DOWN, moving DOWN will bring the head to (row 3, column 2) where there is an apple ('A'). This move will let the snake eat the apple, increasing the score and growing the snake’s length. Therefore, the best move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# SSSS #\n# SSSS #\n# HS A #\n# ASSSS#\n#S SSAS#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nConsidering the snake’s current direction is DOWN, we evaluate the possible moves:\n• Moving RIGHT would land on the cell at (row4, col4) which is occupied by ‘S’ (part of the snake’s body) causing a collision.\n• Moving LEFT goes to an empty space (row4, col2) but does not provide any immediate benefit.\n• Moving DOWN takes the snake from (row4, col3) to (row5, col3), where an apple (‘A’) is located. Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake.\n\nThus, the optimal move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board as provided:\n\n########\n# SSSS #\n# SSSSA#\n# SS A #\n# HSSSS#\n#S SSAS#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board:\n• The snake’s head is at row 4, column 2 and is currently moving DOWN. (Remember that a direct reversal—in this case UP—is forbidden.)\n• Checking the neighboring squares from the head (at (4,2)):\n  – UP: (3,2) contains an S (body), so that’s not allowed anyway.\n  – RIGHT: (4,3) contains an S.\n  – LEFT: (4,1) is an empty space.\n  – DOWN: (5,2) is an empty space.\n• Although moving straight (DOWN) might follow the current direction, if we go DOWN the head would be in a small isolated empty cell (at (5,2)) that is surrounded by snake parts on three sides. This “trap” could severely limit maneuverability in subsequent moves.\n• Alternatively, moving LEFT into (4,1) moves the head into a connected group of free cells (for example, (4,1) connects with free cells at (1,1), (2,1), and (3,1)) that allow more room to eventually reach one of the apples.\n• Since staying down (moving to (5,2)) appears risky while moving LEFT keeps options open for further navigation toward apples, the best choice is to turn LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n# SSSS #\n# SSSSA#\n# SS A #\n#HSSSSS#\n#  SSAS#\n#SSSSSS#\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, the snake’s head is at (row4, col1) and it is moving LEFT. However, moving LEFT would immediately hit the wall. The only other allowed moves (since the snake cannot reverse direction) are UP or DOWN. Looking at the board, moving UP to (row3, col1) is a safe option because that cell is currently empty. Also, moving UP makes it easier to potentially access the apple in row3 (the one at col5) by allowing future turns. Thus, the best move is to change direction to UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","The current game board is:\n########\n# SSSS #\n# SSSSA#\n#HSS A #\n#SSSSSS#\n#  SSAS#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head is at (3,1) and is currently moving UP. The available directions (other than reversing DOWN) are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT would send the head into the wall at col0, and turning RIGHT would send it into its own body at (3,2). Therefore, the only safe and sensible move is to keep going UP, which leads the head from (3,1) to (2,1), an empty cell. \n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# SSSS #\n#HSSSSA#\n#SSS A #\n#SSSSSS#\n#  SSAS#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is at row 2, column 1 and the current direction is UP, the square directly ahead (row 1, column 1) is empty. Turning left would have the snake hit the wall and turning right or down would make it collide with its body. Therefore, the best and only safe move is to keep moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#HSSSS #\n#SSSSSA#\n#SSS A #\n#SSSSSS#\n#  SSAS#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at (2,2) and its current direction is UP—but moving UP would immediately hit the wall (row1 is all “#”), and turning LEFT would also lead into the wall at column 1. Although turning DOWN is not allowed because it directly reverses direction, the only remaining legal option is turning RIGHT. Even if (2,3) already contains part of the snake’s body, all other directions lead to immediate collision with the wall. Therefore, the only permitted move is to steer RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Notably, there is an apple ('A') immediately to the left of the snake head (in the same row but one column to the left). The snake is currently moving UP, and since it is allowed to turn left (as turning in any direction except the exact reverse is permitted), the best move is to turn LEFT. This move will make the snake’s head enter the square with the apple, consuming it and increasing the score by one.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let's first restate the current game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# HS   #\n#     A#\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT and the head of the snake (located at row 4, column 2) is facing left. There are three apples on the board:\n• One at row 2, column 1.\n• One at row 5, column 6.\n• One at row 6, column 2.\n\nBased on the head’s position (row 4, col 2), the closest apple is at (row 6, col 2) – two rows below, with no horizontal difference. Although the snake is currently moving LEFT, it is allowed to change direction (except directly reversing its course). Out of the allowed directions (LEFT, UP, or DOWN) the move DOWN will steer the snake toward that apple. \n\nThus, the optimal move is to change the direction to DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here's the current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H   A#\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 4, column 2 and its body stretches upward to row 3, column 2. With the current direction DOWN, the snake would move from (4,2) to (5,2). Notably, there’s an apple at (5,2), so if we moved down, the snake would eat that apple and grow. However, thinking ahead, after eating the apple the new head will be at (5,2) and the snake’s current body parts will remain—pushing us closer to the borders in the lower part of the board. Comparing the positions of the remaining apples (one at row 1, column 1 and one at row 4, column 6), a move to the RIGHT from (5,2) (taking us to (5,3)) keeps our options open to later navigate towards the apple at (4,6) without immediately heading for the wall after further DOWN movements.\n\nThus, rather than directly going DOWN and growing into a potentially tight area, a RIGHT move appears to be a safer choice to reposition the snake toward the area with better apple prospects.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SH  A#\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current state—with the snake's head at row 4, column 3 and moving RIGHT—the closest apple in the snake’s path is the apple at (row 4, column 6). Continuing RIGHT will steer the snake toward that apple in upcoming moves, and the move is safe with an empty space at (row 4, column 4).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SH A#\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nI analyzed the position: The snake’s head is at row 5, column 5 (considering 1-indexed rows according to the board lines, with the head positioned in “#  SH A#”) and is currently moving RIGHT. There is an apple on the same row at the 7th column (the \"A\" at the end of that row). By continuing to move RIGHT, the snake will advance into the empty cell immediately to its right, and in the subsequent move it can consume the apple, thus increasing the score and length.\n\nChanging the direction to UP or DOWN would not bring the snake any closer to an apple in the immediate future, whereas continuing RIGHT aligns with the apple’s direction. Also, switching to LEFT is not allowed since that would reverse the current direction.\n\nThus, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SHA#\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is currently at the cell next to an apple when moving RIGHT (from the current layout \"#   SHA#\"). Since continuing in the same direction will have the snake move from its head's position at 'H' into the apple 'A', this move is optimal for scoring and growth. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSH#\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board we see that the snake’s head (H) is at row 4, column 6 and its body parts are at (4,4) and (4,5). The snake is currently moving RIGHT. However, moving RIGHT would take the head into the wall at (4,7), which is fatal. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction (so LEFT is not allowed), we are left with turning UP or DOWN.\n\nEvaluating the apple positions:\n• There's an apple at (1,1) and one at (1,4), both in the upper part of the board.\n• There’s also an apple at (5,2) in the lower half.\nWith our head at (4,6), turning DOWN would move the head to (5,6) – a safe empty cell. From there, obtaining the apple at (5,2) (which is 4 steps to the left) seems promising. In contrast, turning UP moves the head to (3,6) and would make the nearer target the apple at (1,4) but it would take a longer route overall given the board layout and our snake’s body position.\n\nThus, the optimal move is to turn DOWN for a safe future path toward the apple on row 5.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    SS#\n# A   H#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe best move is to go LEFT so that the snake can eventually approach the nearby apple at (5,2) by moving horizontally from its current row.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     S#\n# A  HS#\n#      #\n########\n\nI analyzed the board. The snake’s head is at row 6, column 6, and its current direction is LEFT. Since the apple at (row 6, column 3) is straight to the left and moving forward continues in that direction, the best move is to continue going LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A HSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head is at row6, column5 and its current direction is LEFT, the next cell in that direction is at row6, column4 which is empty. Moving LEFT is safe and it will eventually allow the snake to approach the apple located at row6, column3 without jeopardizing itself. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here’s the current game board:\n########\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# AHSS #\n#      #\n########\n\nI’m choosing to continue in the same direction (LEFT) because the snake’s head at row 6, column 4 will then move to row 6, column 3 where an apple is located. This move will let the snake eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#A  A  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# HSSS #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the snake’s head is at row 5, column 2 and currently moving LEFT, we must choose a direction that does not immediately reverse its course and steers it toward one or more of the three apples. The apples are located at (row1, col1), (row1, col4), and (row2, col5). From the head’s position (5,2), moving UP toward row 4, col2 brings the snake closer to the apple at (1,1) (with Manhattan distance dropping from 5 to 4) and overall moves the snake upward into the apple cluster region. Also, moving LEFT would send the head to (5,1) (reducing the distance to (1,1) by 1 as well), but continuing to go LEFT might run it into the wall more quickly given the board edges. Therefore, turning UP is a safer and more strategic choice in this epoch.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#A  A  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n# H    #\n# SSS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nConsidering that the snake is moving UP and the adjacent square above the head (row4, column3) is free and safe, the best choice is to continue in the current direction, which is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#A  A  #\n#    A #\n# H    #\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nI choose to continue moving in the current direction (UP), which leads the snake's head from (3,2) to (2,2). This move is safe as it avoids collisions with the walls and the snake’s body while positioning the snake closer to the apples in the upper rows, allowing for potential future consumption.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#A  A  #\n# H  A #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is currently at (2,2) and it is moving UP, we look at the nearby apples. There’s an apple at (1,1), which is a Manhattan distance of 2 from the head. If we continue moving UP, the head will go to (1,2) on the next move. From that position the apple at (1,1) will be just one move away by turning LEFT, setting up a quick opportunity to gain a score point. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT right now would put the head at (2,1); although from there the apple at (1,1) would also be one move away, staying with the current UP movement avoids abrupt lateral changes and keeps the snake’s path more predictable. There is an apple on the right as well (at (2,5) and (1,4)) but those are farther in Manhattan distance if we deviate. \n\nThus, to steer toward an apple with minimal risk and to continue safely given the board layout and the snake’s current body positions, the best move is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Repeating the current game board:\n########\n#AH A  #\n# S  A #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nConsidering the snake’s head is at row 2, column 3 and it's moving UP, moving UP would immediately hit the top wall. Moving RIGHT would move to an empty cell. However, turning LEFT from row 2, column 3 will place the head on row 2, column 2, where there is an apple. Eating an apple is the best choice since it increases the score and the snake grows. Additionally, turning LEFT is valid because it is not a reversal of the current UP direction. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let's start by repeating the current game board:\n\n########\n#HS AA #\n# S  A #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row1, column1 and the body segments are at row1 col2, row2 col2, row3 col2, and row4 col2. The snake is currently moving LEFT, but continuing LEFT would take the head into the wall at row1, column0. The only valid directions (other than RIGHT, which is not allowed as it is a direct reversal of LEFT) are UP and DOWN. Moving UP would lead the head from (1,1) to (0,1), but row0 is full of wall (‘#’), so that is not safe. Moving DOWN takes the head from (1,1) to (2,1), which is an empty space. Therefore, the safest and only valid move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SS AA #\n#HS  A #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is DOWN and analyzing the board, the snake’s head is at row 2, column 1 and the possible moves (aside from the illegal move of reversing direction) are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT would hit the wall and RIGHT would run into its own body. Therefore, the only safe move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#SS AA #\n#SS  A #\n#H     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake is presently heading DOWN and cannot reverse (i.e., cannot move UP), the available safe moves are to either continue moving DOWN or turn RIGHT. The snake’s head is at (row 4, column 1) and its body occupies positions above it (rows 2‐3, columns 1–2). There are apples on the board in the upper half (in row 2 and row 3), so they lie above the current head position. While moving DOWN does not immediately put the snake on an apple, turning RIGHT will allow a potential change in direction soon that can eventually lead the snake back upward toward those apples. In addition, moving RIGHT is a safe move now because it avoids collision with the walls or the snake’s own body.\n\nThus, the best move according to the current board state and rules is to turn RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here’s the current game board:\n\n########\n#SS AA #\n#S   A #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nLooking at the board, the snake’s head (H) is at row 4, column 3 and is currently moving RIGHT. Since the apple positions (row2: columns 5 and 6; row3: column 6) are to the upper right of the head, continuing in the RIGHT direction keeps the snake on a safe trajectory toward the apples without risking a collision. \n\nThus, based on the game rules and the current board layout, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#S  AA #\n#S   A #\n#SSH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current position of the snake's head (which is in the fourth row at the \"H\" located in the \"SSH\" sequence) and given that it is currently moving RIGHT, continuing in the RIGHT direction moves the head from (3,3) to (3,4). This square is empty, avoiding any collision with the snake’s body or the walls, while also placing the snake in a favorable position to eventually reach one of the nearby apples (especially those at (2,5) and (1,4)\/(1,5)). Thus, the safest and most promising move is to continue moving in the RIGHT direction.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#   AA #\n#S   A #\n#SSSH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head (H) is at row 3, column 4 and the current direction is RIGHT, moving UP would bring the head closer to the nearest apple at (2,5) while maintaining a safe move. Moving RIGHT would simply lead to an empty square, and moving DOWN would take the snake away from the apples. Therefore, the best move is to go UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#   AA #\n#   HA #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 3, column 5 and is moving UP. If the snake continues UP, it will move from row 3, column 5 to row 2, column 5. Analyzing the board, row 2, column 5 contains an apple. Eating this apple will increase the score, and it is a safe move since there’s no body part or wall there. Therefore, the optimal move is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#   HA #\n#   SA #\n#SSSS  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake’s head is currently at row 1, column 4 and moving UP would cause it to hit the wall at row 0, column 4, we must choose another direction. Since the snake is not allowed to reverse (i.e., cannot move DOWN from its current UP direction), the remaining choices are LEFT and RIGHT.

Moreover, by continuing downward the snake can eventually approach the apple at row 6, column 4. Given the obstacles set by the snake's own body on the board, continuing in the current (DOWN) direction avoids immediate risk and maintains a safe path.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#SSS   #\n#S S   #\n#S S  A#\n#S H S #\n#SSSSS #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 5, column 4 and is moving DOWN.

The only legal moves (since the snake cannot reverse its direction, so UP is forbidden) are LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nLooking at the board, we see that the closest apple is at row 7, column 5. While both the apple at row 7, column 2 and row 7, column 5 are equally near in Manhattan distance overall, the gap to safely approach these apples seems to be available on the right side. Notice that row 6 has snake segments in columns 2–6 with an empty gap at column 7. Moving RIGHT from the head (from (5,4) to (5,5)) looks safest as it also leads toward that gap. This move should eventually allow the snake to go past the body and access an apple without colliding immediately. \n\nThus, the best move here is to go RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSS   #\n#S S   #\n#S S  A#\n#S SH  #\n#SSSSS #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the board and the possible moves, I note that the snake’s head is positioned at row 4, column 4, and it’s currently moving RIGHT. Among the three apples on the board, the apple at row 3, column 6 appears to be most accessible if the snake continues to move in its current trajectory. Moving RIGHT will keep the snake in a safe zone while allowing it to eventually turn toward that apple. Additionally, moving DOWN would immediately put it adjacent to an S occupying row 5, column 4 — which is unsafe unless that segment vacates as the tail; however, without certainty on the body’s movement and order, this option is riskier. Moving LEFT is not allowed since it would directly reverse the current movement.

From the head’s position (at column 5), a RIGHT move lands on an empty space at (row 5, column 6). However, if we turn UP instead, the head moves to row 4, column 5 (from the board perspective with walls), which is also an empty cell. By moving UP the snake gets closer to the apple on the same row to the right in the next move (the apple in “#S S  A#” on the row above). Moving UP does not reverse the current direction “RIGHT” and appears to be a better strategy to quickly reach an apple while staying safe.\n\nThus, my move is to go UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#SSS   #\n#S S   #\n#S S HA#\n#S SSS #\n#SSS   #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nI will move RIGHT because that takes the snake’s head from (row 4, col 5) directly onto an apple at (row 4, col 6), ensuring immediate apple consumption and a score increase, while still following the rule that the snake cannot reverse direction (the current direction is UP and RIGHT is allowed).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#SSS   #\n#S S   #\n#SAS SH#\n#S SSS #\n#SSS   #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nSince the snake’s head is at row 4, column 7 and the current motion is RIGHT, moving further RIGHT would hit the wall.

That leaves UP and DOWN as the only legal options.\n\nLooking at the available apples (one at row 4, column 3 and two in row 7) and considering the congestion of snake parts in the upper area, moving DOWN appears the safer and more promising choice. It avoids the wall and, after moving down from (4,7) to (5,7), the snake can eventually navigate toward the apple at (7,5) in the open space at the bottom of the board.\n\nTherefore, based on the current situation, my chosen move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#SSS   #\n#S S   #\n#SAS SS#\n#S SSSH#\n#SS    #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake’s head is at row 4, column 6 and it is moving DOWN.

Therefore, the optimal move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","The current game board is:\n########\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSSS S#\n#SSSSSS#\n#SAH   #\n#S  AA #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nAnalyzing the board, our snake’s head is at (row 4, column 3) (using 0-indexed rows where the top wall is row 0) and is currently moving DOWN. There is an apple directly to the left of the head, at (row 4, column 2). Since turning LEFT (from a downward movement) is allowed (the snake cannot turn directly UP from DOWN, but LEFT is fine), moving LEFT would immediately consume an apple, increase the score, and grow the snake—all beneficial outcomes.\n\nThus, my move will be LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSSS S#\n#SSSSSS#\n#SHS   #\n#S  AAA#\n#SSS   #\n########\nBased on the current board, the snake’s head is at row 5, column 2, and all the apples are on row 6 at columns 4–6. Continuing in the left direction would move into the body (at row 5, column 1) and moving up would also run into a body segment (at row 4, column 2). Moving down will bring the head to row 6, column 2 – a safe move that directs the snake closer to the apples. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSSS S#\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSS   #\n#SH AAA#\n#SS    #\n########\n\nAfter analyzing the current board: the snake's head is at row 6, column 3 and its current movement is DOWN. Continuing DOWN would move the head into row 7, column 3, which is already occupied by the snake’s body ('S'), resulting in an immediate collision. Changing to LEFT would reverse the horizontal position to row 6, column 2, which is also occupied by the snake’s body. However, turning RIGHT moves the head from row 6, column 3 to row 6, column 4—a safe, empty space—and it brings the snake closer to the apples at row 6, columns 5 to 7. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSSS S#\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSS   #\n#SSHAAA#\n#S     #\n########\nThe snake's current head is at row 6 and column 4, and there are three apples immediately to the right (in row 6, columns 5, 6, and 7).

Checking the neighboring cells, the cell to the LEFT (row 7, column 5) contains an apple (‘A’), making it both a safe and beneficial move since the snake will eat the apple and grow.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSSS S#\n#SSSSSS#\n# SSAA #\n# SSSSS#\n#AHSSSS#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 87\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","epoch":87,"seed":7,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
