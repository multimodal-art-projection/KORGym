The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n# SS   #\n# HSSA #\n# SSS  #\n#  SSA #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 22\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"UP","response":["```\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nPossible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, UP (cannot move DOWN).\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head moves to (3, 3). This is a valid empty square. The snake will be closer to the apple at (1, 3).\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (4, 2). This is a valid empty square.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (4, 4). This is a valid empty square. This positions the snake adjacent to two apples (at (4, 5) and (5, 4)).\n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to potentially eat an apple in the very next turn (either by moving RIGHT again or by moving DOWN). Moving UP requires at least two more steps to reach the apple at (1, 3). Moving LEFT moves away from the closest apples. Therefore, moving RIGHT is the most promising move to maximize the score quickly.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 5) and its body is at (4, 3). The current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot move LEFT because it's the reverse direction.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (3, 5). This is an empty space, a valid move.\n2.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (5, 5). This is an empty space, a valid move.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (4, 6). This is a wall '#', resulting in a collision. Invalid move.\n\nThe valid moves are UP and DOWN.\nLet's evaluate the valid moves:\n- If we move UP to (3, 5), the snake is closer to the apple at (1, 5).\n- If we move DOWN to (5, 5), the snake is closer to the apple at (5, 4). The distance is 1 (move LEFT next).\n\nMoving DOWN positions the snake to eat the apple at (5, 4) in the next step by moving LEFT. This seems like a good strategy. Let's check the safety. Moving DOWN moves the head to (5, 5), which is safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake head is at (5, 4). The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves:\n1.  Continue DOWN: Move to (6, 4). This is safe.\n2.  Turn LEFT: Move to (5, 3). This is safe.\n3.  Turn RIGHT: Move to (5, 5). This is safe.\n4.  Turn UP: This is not allowed as it reverses the current direction (DOWN).\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves:\n- DOWN (to 6, 4): Moves further away from all apples.\n- LEFT (to 5, 3): Moves towards the left wall, further from the right-side apples.\n- RIGHT (to 5, 5): Moves towards the right side, closer to the apples at (1, 5) and (2, 5). This seems like the best strategic move to get closer to food while remaining safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 5).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake's body segments are at (5, 4) and (4, 4).\nThe available apples are at (1, 2), (1, 4), and (2, 5).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  **UP:** Move head to (4, 5). This is an empty space and a valid move (not opposite to RIGHT). This move brings the snake closer to the apple at (2, 5).\n2.  **DOWN:** Move head to (6, 5). This is an empty space and a valid move.\n3.  **RIGHT:** Move head to (5, 6). This is an empty space and a valid move.\n4.  **LEFT:** Invalid move, as it's the opposite of the current direction (RIGHT).\n\nTo maximize the score, the snake should move towards the nearest apple. The apple at (2, 5) is the closest. Moving UP to (4, 5) gets the snake closer to this apple. Moving RIGHT or DOWN moves the snake away from or parallel to this apple. Moving UP is safe and strategically sound.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#  A A #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#   SS #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 4). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n1.  Move UP: The snake head moves to (3, 4). This is an empty square (' '). This is a valid move. It moves the snake towards the apples in the upper part of the board.\n2.  Move LEFT: The snake head moves to (4, 3). This is an empty square (' '). This is a valid move. It moves the snake away from the apples.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The snake head moves to (4, 5). This is an empty square (' '). This is a valid move. It moves the snake closer to the apple at (2, 5).\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe moves that position the snake closer to apples. Moving UP positions the snake more centrally towards the cluster of apples, offering potentially more options later. Moving RIGHT targets the apple at (2, 5) more directly. Given the current position and the location of apples, moving UP seems like a reasonable choice to approach the general area of the apples while maintaining flexibility.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#    A #\n#    H #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 4).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- Move UP: Head moves to (2, 4). This square contains an apple 'A'. Eating the apple increases the snake's length and score. This is a valid and beneficial move.\n- Move LEFT: Head moves to (3, 3). This square is empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n- Move RIGHT: Head moves to (3, 5). This square is empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. This increases the score and length. The position after eating the apple (2, 4) is centrally located between the other two apples at (1, 2) and (1, 5), making them accessible. Moving LEFT or RIGHT does not yield an immediate apple. Therefore, moving UP is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#  A A #\n# A  H #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nThe current head position is (2, 5). The snake body is at (3, 5), (4, 5), and (5, 5). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse of UP.\n1.  **UP:** Move head to (1, 5). This square contains an apple ('A'). This move is valid (not a wall or self-collision). Eating the apple increases the score and snake length.\n2.  **LEFT:** Move head to (2, 4). This square is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n3.  **RIGHT:** Move head to (2, 6). This square is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n\nThe primary goal is to eat apples. Moving UP allows the snake to eat the apple at (1, 5) immediately. Let's check the state after moving UP:\nHead will be at (1, 5). The snake body will be at (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5). The new direction will be UP.\nThe next possible moves from (1, 5) would be LEFT (to 1, 4) or RIGHT (to 1, 6), as UP would hit the wall and DOWN is reversing the previous body segment. Both LEFT and RIGHT are safe moves in the subsequent step.\nSince eating the apple is beneficial and safe, moving UP is the best strategy.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A H #\n# A  S #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 5) and it is moving UP.\nPossible moves:\n1.

Valid move.\n4.  RIGHT: Move to (1, 6). This is an empty space ' '. Valid move.\n\nWe need to choose between LEFT and RIGHT.\nThere are apples at (1, 2), (2, 1), and (6, 2).\nMoving LEFT towards (1, 4) brings the snake closer to the cluster of apples at (1, 2) and (2, 1). A possible sequence could be LEFT, LEFT (eat apple at 1,2), DOWN, LEFT (eat apple at 2,1).\nMoving RIGHT towards (1, 6) moves the snake away from all apples and towards the right wall, which could limit future movement options.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is the better strategy to approach the nearest apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  AHS #\n# A  S #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at position (1, 4). The current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake's body segments are at (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), and (4, 5).\nApples are at (1, 2), (2, 1), and (6, 2).\n\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, and DOWN (cannot move RIGHT as it's the reverse of LEFT).\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (0, 4). This position contains a wall '#'. This move leads to game over.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (2, 4). This position is empty ' '. This is a safe move.\n3.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (1, 3). This position is empty ' '. This is a safe move.\n\nNow consider the strategic value of the safe moves (LEFT and DOWN):\n- **Moving LEFT:** The head moves to (1, 3). The snake is now adjacent to the apple at (1, 2). The next move could be LEFT to eat this apple.\n- **Moving DOWN:** The head moves to (2, 4). The closest apple is at (2, 1), which would require several LEFT moves. Another apple is at (6, 2), which requires multiple DOWN and LEFT moves.\n\nMoving LEFT positions the snake to eat the nearest apple in the next step. This seems like the best strategy.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#  HSS #\n# A  S #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1.  **LEFT**: The snake's head is at (1, 2). Moving LEFT would move the head to (1, 1). This square is empty and not a wall or body part. This is a valid move.\n2.  **RIGHT**: The current direction is LEFT, so moving RIGHT is forbidden (reversing direction).\n3.  **UP**: Moving UP would move the head to (0, 2). This is a wall ('#'). This move leads to game over.\n4.  **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would move the head to (2, 2). This square is empty and not a wall or body part. This is a valid move.\n\nNow let's consider the strategy. There is an apple ('A') at (2, 1), which is close.\n- If we move **LEFT** to (1, 1), the next move could be DOWN to (2, 1) to eat the apple.\n- If we move **DOWN** to (2, 2), the next move could be LEFT to (2, 1) to eat the apple.\n\nBoth moves, LEFT and DOWN, are safe and allow access to the nearby apple in the subsequent step. Moving DOWN aligns the snake vertically, potentially offering better access to the lower part of the board where two other apples are located later. Therefore, moving DOWN seems like a reasonable choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#  SSS #\n# AH S #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 2) (using 0-based indexing from the top-left corner, ignoring walls). The current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot move UP (reverse direction). The possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (2, 1). This square contains an apple 'A'. Eating the apple increases the score and snake length. This move is valid as it's not a wall or the snake's body.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (2, 3). This square is empty ' '. This move is valid.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (3, 2). This square is empty ' '. This move is valid.\n\nThe primary objective is to eat apples. Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat the apple at (2, 1) immediately. This is the most beneficial move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#  SSS #\n# HS S #\n#    S #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\nThe snake's head is at (2, 2).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (2, 1). This is a valid empty square.\n2.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (1, 2). This is a valid empty square, but moves towards the upper body and wall.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (3, 2). This is a valid empty square. This move directs the snake towards the open space and the general area of the apples at (4, 4), (6, 3), and (6, 5).\n\nComparing the options, moving DOWN is the most strategic choice as it moves towards the apples while maintaining space to maneuver. Moving UP risks getting trapped near the top border and the snake's body. Moving LEFT moves away from the apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#  SSS #\n# SS S #\n# H    #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 13\n\nThe snake head is at row 3, column 1 (H). The current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP because it's the reverse direction.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n1.  Check LEFT: The square to the left (3, 0) is a wall ('#'). Moving LEFT results in a collision. Invalid move.\n2.  Check RIGHT: The square to the right (3, 2) is empty (' '). This is a safe move. It moves the snake towards the apple at (4, 3).\n3.  Check DOWN: The square below (4, 1) is empty (' '). This is a safe move. It moves the snake towards the apple cluster at the bottom, but further from the single apple at (4, 3) compared to moving RIGHT.\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN are safe moves. The closest apple is at (4, 3). Moving RIGHT brings the head to (3, 2), which is closer to the apple at (4, 3) (Manhattan distance becomes 2). Moving DOWN brings the head to (4, 1), which is also closer (Manhattan distance becomes 2). Moving RIGHT seems slightly better as it positions the snake to potentially move DOWN next towards the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#  SSS #\n# SS   #\n# SH   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 14\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (3, 3) (row 3, column 3, 0-indexed).\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4).\nApples 'A' are at (4, 4), (6, 3), (6, 5).\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot move LEFT.\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP**: The head would move to (2, 3). This position is occupied by the snake's body 'S'. This move results in a collision. Invalid move.\n2.  **Move DOWN**: The head would move to (4, 3). This position is empty. This move is valid. The nearest apple at (4, 4) is one step away (RIGHT).\n3.  **Move RIGHT**: The head would move to (3, 4). This position is empty. This move is valid. The nearest apple at (4, 4) is one step away (DOWN).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are safe moves and position the snake to eat the nearest apple in the next step. Choosing DOWN moves the snake towards the lower part of the board where the other two apples are located.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#  SS  #\n# SS   #\n# SS   #\n#  HA  #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nThe snake's head 'H' is at row 4, column 3 (0-indexed).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible next moves:\n1.  DOWN: Move to (5, 3). This square is empty. Valid move.\n2.  LEFT: Move to (4, 2). This square is occupied by the snake's body 'S'. Invalid move (collision).\n3.  RIGHT: Move to (4, 4). This square contains an apple 'A'. Valid move, eats the apple.\n4.  UP: Invalid move, as the snake cannot reverse its direction (current direction is DOWN).\n\nTo maximize the score, eating the apple is the priority. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple at (4, 4). Moving DOWN is safe but doesn't eat an apple immediately. Moving LEFT leads to collision. Therefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#  SS  #\n# SS   #\n# SS   #\n#  SH  #\n#      #\n#  AAA #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (4, 5).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT is not a valid move.\nMoving RIGHT would lead to (4, 6), which is a wall '#', causing a game over.\nMoving UP would lead to (3, 5), which is an empty space ' '. This is a valid move.\nMoving DOWN would lead to (5, 5), which is an empty space ' '. This is a valid move.\n\nBetween UP and DOWN:\n- Moving UP to (3, 5) positions the snake further away from the apples at (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4). The next mandatory move would likely be UP again (to avoid hitting the body 'S' at (3, 4) or the wall at (3, 6)), moving even further away.\n- Moving DOWN to (5, 5) positions the snake closer to the row containing the apples. From (5, 5) with direction DOWN, the snake could then move LEFT to (5, 4) or DOWN to (6, 5), both of which are safe and allow maneuvering towards the apples.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is the strategically better move for survival and reaching the apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#  S   #\n# SS   #\n# SS   #\n#  SS  #\n#   H  #\n#  AAA #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 17\n\nMy analysis suggests the following:\n1.  The snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 4).\n2.  The current direction is DOWN.\n3.  Possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving UP is not allowed (reversing direction).\n4.  Moving DOWN: The head moves to (6, 4). This square contains an apple 'A'. Eating the apple is good. The snake will grow. Position (6, 4) is safe (not a wall or self). From (6,4), the snake can move LEFT (to apple at 6,3) or RIGHT (to empty space at 6,5).\n5.  Moving LEFT: The head moves to (5, 3). This square is empty ' '. This move is safe. From (5,3), the snake can move DOWN (to apple at 6,3) or LEFT (to empty space at 5,2).\n6.  Moving RIGHT: The head moves to (5, 5). This square is empty ' '. This move is safe. From (5,5), the snake can move DOWN (to empty space at 6,5) or UP (to empty space at 4,5).\n\nComparing the options, moving DOWN immediately allows the snake to eat an apple and positions it to potentially eat another apple on the next move (by moving LEFT). Moving LEFT delays eating but also leads towards an apple. Moving RIGHT moves away from the apples. Therefore, moving DOWN is the most beneficial immediate action.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#  S   #\n# SS   #\n# SS   #\n#  SSA #\n#   S  #\n#  AHA #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 3). The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. Moving UP is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n\n1.  **Move DOWN:** The position (7, 3) is a wall '#'. This move leads to game over.\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The position (6, 2) contains an apple 'A'. This is a safe move and allows the snake to eat an apple.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The position (6, 4) is empty. This is a safe move.\n\nThe best move is to eat the apple to the LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  S   #\n# SS  A#\n# SS   #\n#  SSA #\n#   S  #\n#  HSA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6, 2) (row 6, column 2, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake body 'S' occupies the following coordinates: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4).\nApples 'A' are at (2, 6), (4, 5), (6, 5).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  **UP**: Move head to (5, 2). This square is currently empty. This is a valid move.\n2.  **DOWN**: Move head to (7, 2). This square is a wall '#'. This move leads to collision and game over. Invalid move.\n3.  **LEFT**: Move head to (6, 1). This square is currently empty. This is a valid move.\n4.  **RIGHT**: The current direction is LEFT, so the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. Invalid move.\n\nThe valid moves are UP and LEFT. We need to choose the best one. Let's analyze the consequences:\n\n*   **If we move UP:** The head moves to (5, 2). The only subsequent valid move from (5, 2) with direction UP would be LEFT to (5, 1). From (5, 1) with direction LEFT, both UP (to 4, 1) and DOWN (to 6, 1) are possible. Both these paths lead to unavoidable collisions within the next 1-2 moves (as detailed simulation shows the snake traps itself).\n*   **If we move LEFT:** The head moves to (6, 1). The only subsequent valid move from (6, 1) with direction LEFT would be UP to (5, 1). From (5, 1) with direction UP, both UP (to 4, 1) and RIGHT (to 5, 2) are possible. Both these paths also lead to unavoidable collisions within the next 1-2 moves (as detailed simulation shows the snake traps itself).\n\nIt seems the snake is trapped, and either valid move (UP or LEFT) will lead to a game over within 3 steps. Since both immediate moves are safe but lead to inescapable situations shortly after, neither is definitively better for long-term survival. Choosing UP moves the snake slightly away from the bottom edge.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n# SS  A#\n# SS   #\n#  SSA #\n#  HS  #\n#  SSA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 20\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5, 3).

This would result in a collision.\n2.  Move LEFT: The square at (5, 2) is empty. This is a valid move.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The square at (5, 4) contains 'S' (snake body). This would result in a collision.\n\nThe only safe move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#      #\n# S   A#\n# SS   #\n#  SSA #\n# HSS  #\n#  SSA #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 21\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at coordinates (5, 1) (row 5, column 1, 0-indexed from top-left inside the walls).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT, as it's the opposite of LEFT.\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The snake head would move to (5, 0). This position is a wall '#'. Collision -> Game Over.\n2.  **Move UP:** The snake head would move to (4, 1). This position is empty ' '. This is a valid and safe move.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The snake head would move to (6, 1). This position is empty ' '. This is a valid and safe move.\n\nBoth UP and DOWN are safe immediate moves. The apples are located on the right side of the board (column 6). Both UP and DOWN allow the snake to potentially turn RIGHT in subsequent moves to head towards the apples.\n\nLet's consider the next step after each potential move:\n*   If I move UP to (4, 1), the direction becomes UP. From (4, 1), I can move UP to (3, 1) (empty) or RIGHT to (4, 2) (empty).\n*   If I move DOWN to (6, 1), the direction becomes DOWN. From (6, 1), I can move UP to (5, 1) (which will become 'S', collision) or RIGHT to (6, 2) (empty). Moving DOWN hits the wall.\n\nMoving UP provides more options for the next move (UP or RIGHT), while moving DOWN forces the next move to be RIGHT (or collision). Therefore, moving UP offers slightly more flexibility in navigating the tight space.\n\nMy chosen move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n# SS   #\n# HSSA #\n# SSS  #\n#  SSA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 22\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1.  **UP**: The snake head H is at (4, 1). Moving UP would place the head at (3, 1). This square contains a snake body part 'S'. This move leads to a collision.\n2.  **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would place the head at (4, 0). This square contains a wall '#'. This move leads to a collision.\n3.  **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would place the head at (4, 2). This square contains a snake body part 'S'. This move leads to a collision.\n4.  **DOWN**: This move is not allowed because the current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction.\n\nAll valid moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) result in a collision, meaning the game will end immediately regardless of the chosen direction. Since no move can avoid a collision, I will choose to continue in the current direction.\n\nAnswer: UP"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** Head moves to (2, 3). This is an empty space. Safe. Closest apples are at (2, 1) and (1, 1).\n2.  **Move LEFT:** Head moves to (3, 2). This is an empty space. Safe. This move brings the snake closer to the apples at (2, 1) and (1, 1).\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** Head moves to (3, 4). This is an empty space. Safe. This moves the snake further from the apples at (2, 1) and (1, 1).\n\nMoving LEFT is the best option as it positions the snake closer to the two apples on the left side of the board. The next move could then be UP towards (2, 1).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n# A    #\n#A     #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 2).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\nMoving UP takes the head to (2, 2).\nMoving DOWN takes the head to (4, 2).\nMoving LEFT takes the head to (3, 1).\n\nThere are apples 'A' at (1, 2), (2, 1), and (5, 6).\nThe closest apples are at (1, 2) and (2, 1).\n\nLet's analyze the moves:\n1.  Move UP: Head moves to (2, 2). From here, a LEFT move on the next turn will eat the apple at (2, 1).\n2.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (3, 1). From here, an UP move on the next turn will eat the apple at (2, 1).\n3.  Move DOWN: Head moves to (4, 2). This moves away from the nearest apples.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT position the snake to eat the apple at (2, 1) in the next step. Let's consider the situation after eating the apple.\n- If we move UP now, then LEFT: Head eats apple at (2, 1), body appears at (2, 2), direction becomes LEFT. Possible next moves are UP (to 1, 1) or DOWN (to 3, 1). Both are safe.\n- If we move LEFT now, then UP: Head eats apple at (2, 1), body appears at (3, 1), direction becomes UP. Possible next moves are LEFT (wall) or RIGHT (to 2, 2). Only RIGHT is safe.\n\nMoving UP first leaves more options open immediately after eating the apple. Therefore, UP is a slightly better strategic move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#AH    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at (2, 3). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n- Moving UP leads to (1, 3), which is empty.\n- Moving LEFT leads to (2, 2), which is empty.\n- Moving RIGHT leads to (2, 4), which is empty.\n\nThere are apples 'A' at (1, 2), (2, 1), and (5, 6).\n- Moving UP to (1, 3) positions the snake to potentially move LEFT next turn to eat the apple at (1, 2).\n- Moving LEFT to (2, 2) positions the snake to potentially move LEFT next turn to eat the apple at (2, 1).\n- Moving RIGHT moves away from the nearby apples.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are good moves towards an apple. Let's choose LEFT to approach the apple at (2, 1).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#HS    #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 1) and the body is at (2, 2). The snake is currently moving LEFT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, and LEFT. Moving RIGHT is not allowed as it's the reverse of the current direction.\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (1, 1). This cell contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move. The snake eats the apple, grows, and the score increases.\n2.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (3, 1). This cell is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (2, 0). This cell is a wall ('#'). This is an invalid move (collision).\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n- Moving UP allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which increases the score and length. The position after eating is safe.\n- Moving DOWN is safe but doesn't yield any points in this step.\n\nThe best strategy is generally to prioritize eating apples when safe. Moving UP is safe and results in eating an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#HA    #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nThe snake head is at (1, 1), and the body is at (2, 1). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are LEFT and RIGHT.\nMoving UP would hit the wall '#'.\nMoving DOWN is not allowed as it reverses the current direction.\nMoving LEFT would hit the wall '#'.\nMoving RIGHT would land on the apple 'A' at (1, 2). This is a safe move, eats an apple, increases the score, and grows the snake. The new head would be at (1, 2), and the body would occupy (1, 1) and (2, 1).\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#SH    #\n#S A   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\n1.  **Analyze the board:** The snake head 'H' is at (1, 2) (row 1, column 2, 0-indexed from top-left). The body 'S' is at (1, 1) and (2, 1). Apples 'A' are at (2, 3), (4, 5), and (5, 6). The snake is moving RIGHT.\n2.  **Identify possible moves:** The snake is moving RIGHT, so it cannot move LEFT. The possible moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n    *   **UP:** Move to (0, 2). This hits the wall '#'. Invalid move.\n    *   **DOWN:** Move to (2, 2). This is an empty space ' '. Valid move.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Move to (1, 3). This is an empty space ' '. Valid move.\n3.  **Evaluate valid moves:**\n    *   **DOWN:** The snake moves to (2, 2). The new head position is (2, 2). The snake body becomes S at (1, 2) and S at (1, 1). The board state would be safe. This move positions the snake adjacent to the apple at (2, 3), requiring a RIGHT turn next.\n    *   **RIGHT:** The snake moves to (1, 3). The new head position is (1, 3). The snake body becomes S at (1, 2) and S at (1, 1). The board state would be safe. This move also positions the snake adjacent to the apple at (2, 3), requiring a DOWN turn next.\n4.  **Choose the best move:** Both DOWN and RIGHT are safe moves that position the snake to eat the nearest apple at (2, 3) in the next step. Let's analyze the position after eating the apple for both scenarios:\n    *   If move DOWN now, next move RIGHT (eat apple): Head at (2, 3), Body at (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1). Direction RIGHT.\n    *   If move RIGHT now, next move DOWN (eat apple): Head at (2, 3), Body at (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1). Direction DOWN.\n    Both positions after eating the apple seem relatively open. Moving RIGHT first keeps the snake slightly higher on the board initially, which might offer slightly better access to the lower apples later. Both moves are reasonable short-term choices. Let's choose RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n#SSH   #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 4). The body segments are at (1, 3) and (1, 2).\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot move LEFT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n1.  Check move UP: The head would move to (0, 4), which is a wall '#'. This leads to game over.\n2.  Check move DOWN: The head would move to (2, 4). This square is empty ' '. This move is safe. The new head position (2, 4) is closer to the apple at (2, 3). The next move could be LEFT to eat the apple.\n3.  Check move RIGHT: The head would move to (1, 5). This square is empty ' '. This move is safe.\n\nComparing DOWN and RIGHT: Moving DOWN positions the snake to eat the apple at (2, 3) in the next turn by moving LEFT. Moving RIGHT moves the snake further along the top row, away from the nearest apple. Therefore, moving DOWN is the better strategic choice to eat the closest apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#SSS   #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 9\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  The snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 3).\n2.  The snake's body 'S' occupies (1, 3), (1, 2), and (1, 1).\n3.  The current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot move UP (reverse direction).\n4.  The possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN.\n5.  Apples 'A' are located at (4, 5), (5, 5), and (5, 6). The goal is to move towards these apples.\n6.  Evaluate possible moves:\n    *   Move LEFT: Head moves to (2, 2). This is a safe square (not a wall or body part). This moves away from the apples.\n    *   Move RIGHT: Head moves to (2, 4). This is a safe square. This moves horizontally, potentially towards the apples' column.\n    *   Move DOWN: Head moves to (3, 3). This is a safe square. This moves vertically closer to the apples.\n7.  Both DOWN and RIGHT moves position the snake to approach the apples. Moving DOWN gets the snake vertically closer to the cluster of apples immediately. Moving DOWN seems like a good strategy to approach the nearest apple at (4, 5).\n\nMove: DOWN\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n# SS   #\n#  S   #\n#  H   #\n#    A #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 10\n\nMy analysis:\n1.  The snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 3) (row 3, column 3, using 0-based indexing from the top-left corner inside the walls).\n2.  The current direction is DOWN.\n3.  Possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN. Moving UP is invalid because it reverses the current direction.\n4.  Check potential collisions:\n    *   Move LEFT: The head would move to (3, 2). This position is occupied by the snake's body 'S'. This move leads to a collision.\n    *   Move RIGHT: The head would move to (3, 4). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid and safe move.\n    *   Move DOWN: The head would move to (4, 3). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid and safe move.\n5.  Evaluate valid moves (RIGHT, DOWN):\n    *   Moving RIGHT places the head at (3, 4). The apples are at (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6). This move keeps the snake higher up.\n    *   Moving DOWN places the head at (4, 3). This moves the head onto the same row as the nearest apple cluster, potentially allowing quicker access. From (4, 3), a subsequent RIGHT move would bring the head to (4, 4), closer to the apple at (4, 5).\n6.  Choosing the move: Both RIGHT and DOWN are safe. Moving DOWN seems slightly more advantageous as it directly positions the snake to move towards the cluster of apples in the subsequent steps.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n```\n########\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#  H A #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 3). The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving UP is not allowed as it reverses the current direction.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (4, 2). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (4, 4). This square is empty. This is a valid move. This move places the head adjacent to the apple at (4, 5).\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (5, 3). This square is empty. This is a valid move. This move places the head adjacent to the apple at (5, 4).\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN move the snake towards apples. Moving RIGHT positions the snake to eat the apple at (4, 5) in the next step by moving RIGHT again. Moving DOWN positions the snake to eat the apple at (5, 4) in the next step by moving RIGHT.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 4) seems like a good option as it targets the apple at (4, 5) directly.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#  SHA #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n########\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nValid moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (cannot move LEFT as it's the reverse of RIGHT).\n- Moving UP: Head goes to (3, 3).

Turn DOWN: The head would move to (5, 5). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move, and the snake will eat the apple and grow.\n4.  Turn LEFT: This move is not allowed because the snake is currently moving RIGHT (cannot reverse direction).\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n- Moving RIGHT takes the snake to an empty space (4, 6).\n- Moving UP takes the snake to an empty space (3, 5), positioning it closer to the apple at (3, 4).\n- Moving DOWN takes the snake to (5, 5), immediately eating an apple, increasing the score and snake length.\n\nSince eating apples is the goal, moving DOWN is the most immediately beneficial move. It is safe as the target square (5, 5) is not a wall or part of the snake's body, and it contains an apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#  S   #\n#  SA  #\n#  SSS #\n#    HA#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 14\n\nThe snake's head is at coordinates (5, 5) (row, column, 0-indexed inside the walls).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN (cannot move UP as it's the reverse direction).\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The target square is (5, 4), which contains a part of the snake's body ('S'). This move would result in a collision. Invalid move.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The target square is (5, 6), which contains an apple ('A'). This move is valid. The snake will eat the apple, increase its length by 1, and the score will increase by 1. The head will move to (5, 6).\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The target square is (6, 5), which is empty. This move is valid. The snake will move to (6, 5) without eating an apple.\n\nThe goal is to eat as many apples as possible. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. This move is safe and increases the score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n```\n########\n# A  A #\n#  S   #\n#  SA  #\n#  SSS #\n#    SH#\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 15\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 6) (row 5, column 6, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible next moves:\n1.  Continue RIGHT: Move to (5, 7). This is a wall '#'. Collision. Game over.\n2.  Turn UP: Move to (4, 6). This is an empty square ' '. Safe move.\n3.  Turn DOWN: Move to (6, 6). This is an empty square ' '. Safe move.\n4.  Turn LEFT: This is the reverse of the current direction (RIGHT), so it's an invalid move.\n\nComparing valid moves:\n-   Moving UP to (4, 6) keeps the snake away from walls and body parts, positioning it closer to the upper part of the board where two apples are located.\n-   Moving DOWN to (6, 6) moves the snake towards the bottom wall, potentially trapping it.\n\nChoosing UP seems like a better strategic move to access the apples and maintain more open space.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#  SA  #\n#  SSSH#\n#    SS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 6) (row 4, column 6).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reversing direction).\nLet's check the other possible moves:\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (3, 6). This square is empty (' '). This is a safe move.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (4, 5). This square contains a part of the snake's body ('S'). This move would result in a collision.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (4, 7). This square is a wall ('#'). This move would result in a collision.\n\nThe only safe and valid move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#   A H#\n#  SSSS#\n#    SS#\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 17\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 6). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n1.  Move UP: New head position (2, 6). This is an empty space, safe. This moves towards the top wall.\n2.  Move LEFT: New head position (3, 5). This is an empty space, safe. This moves towards the apple at (3, 3).\n3.  Move RIGHT: New head position (3, 7). This is a wall ('#'), collision, game over.\n\nComparing UP and LEFT:\n- Moving LEFT brings the snake closer to the apple at (3, 3) (2 moves away: LEFT, LEFT).\n- Moving UP moves the snake to (2, 6). From there, the only safe moves are LEFT (to 2, 5) or DOWN (which is reversing direction from the previous UP->LEFT sequence, not allowed if direction becomes LEFT). If we continue UP, the next move must be LEFT (to 2,5). From (2,5), moving UP again leads to the apple at (1, 5) (3 moves total: UP, LEFT, UP).\n\nMoving LEFT seems like a better immediate strategy as it targets the closest apple at (3,3).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#   AHS#\n#   SSS#\n#    SS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 18\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\nThe snake's head is at (3, 4).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves:\n1.  **LEFT:** Move to (3, 3). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a safe move and results in eating an apple.\n2.  **UP:** Move to (2, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a safe move.\n3.  **DOWN:** Move to (4, 4). This square contains part of the snake's body ('S'). This move would result in a collision.\n\nThe best move is to go LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#   HSS#\n#A  SSS#\n#    SS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 3).\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies positions (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5).\nApples 'A' are at positions (1, 1), (1, 5), and (4, 0).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  **LEFT:** Move head to (3, 2). This position is empty. This is a valid move.\n2.  **UP:** Move head to (2, 3). This position is empty. This is a valid move.\n3.  **DOWN:** Move head to (4, 3). This position is occupied by the snake's body 'S'. This move leads to a collision and is invalid.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Cannot move RIGHT because the current direction is LEFT (reversing direction is not allowed).\n\nWe need to choose between moving LEFT and moving UP. Let's evaluate the options by considering the proximity to apples and future safety.\n\n*   **If move LEFT:**\n    *   Head moves to (3, 2).\n    *   Nearest apples: (1, 1) at distance 3, (4, 0) at distance 3, (1, 5) at distance 5.\n    *   This move positions the snake closer to the apple at (4, 0). A potential path is LEFT -> UP -> LEFT -> DOWN -> DOWN -> LEFT (6 steps).\n\n*   **If move UP:**\n    *   Head moves to (2, 3).\n    *   Nearest apples: (1, 1) at distance 3, (1, 5) at distance 3, (4, 0) at distance 5.\n    *   This move positions the snake closer to the apples at (1, 1) and (1, 5). A potential path to (1, 1) is UP -> LEFT -> UP -> LEFT (4 steps). A potential path to (1, 5) is UP -> RIGHT -> UP -> RIGHT (4 steps).\n\nMoving UP allows the snake to reach an apple (either (1, 1) or (1, 5)) in fewer steps (4 steps) compared to moving LEFT (which requires a longer path of 6 steps to reach (4, 0) safely). Therefore, moving UP is the better strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n# A  A #\n#   H  #\n#   SSS#\n#A   SS#\n#    SS#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 20\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 4) (0-indexed from top-left inside walls).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:**\n    *   New head position: (1, 4).\n    *   This position is empty (' ').\n    *   This move is safe. It positions the snake closer to the apples at (1, 1) and (1, 5). A subsequent move RIGHT would eat the apple at (1, 5).\n\n2.  **Move LEFT:**\n    *   New head position: (2, 3).\n    *   This position is empty (' ').\n    *   This move is safe. It positions the snake closer to the apple at (1, 1) and potentially the one at (4, 1).\n\n3.  **Move RIGHT:**\n    *   New head position: (2, 5).\n    *   This position is empty (' ').\n    *   This move is safe. It positions the snake closer to the apple at (1, 5) but also closer to its own body and the right wall.\n\nComparing the options, moving UP allows for an immediate subsequent move (RIGHT) to capture the apple at (1, 5). Moving LEFT sets up a path towards the apple at (1, 1). Moving UP seems slightly more advantageous as it leads to an apple in two steps.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# A HA #\n#   S  #\n#   SSS#\n#A    S#\n#    SS#\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n# A SH #\n#   S  #\n#   SSS#\n#A   AS#\n#    SS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 22\n\nThe snake's head is at row 1, column 6.\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nIf the snake continues RIGHT, it will hit the wall at column 7.

This move results in a collision.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The new head position would be (3, 5). This square is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This move results in a collision.\n\nAll possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) lead to a game over situation as the snake will collide with itself or the wall.

The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n\n1.  Move UP: The head moves to (3, 3). This square contains an apple ('A'). The snake eats the apple, grows to length 2, and the score increases by 1. The new head position will be (3, 3) and the body will be at (4, 3). This is a safe move.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (4, 2). This square is empty. The snake's position becomes (4, 2). This is a safe move.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (4, 4). This square is empty. The snake's position becomes (4, 4). This is a safe move and positions the snake next to the apple at (4, 5).\n\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. This increases the score and length. The resulting position appears safe with multiple subsequent move options. This seems like the best strategic move to increase the score quickly.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#  H   #\n#  S A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nThe current snake head 'H' is at (3, 3) and the body 'S' is at (4, 3). The snake is moving UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse of UP.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head moves to (2, 3). This position is empty and safe. It moves towards apples at (1, 4) and (2, 1).\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (3, 2). This position is empty and safe. It moves towards the apple at (2, 1).\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (3, 4). This position is empty and safe. It moves towards apples at (1, 4) and (4, 5).\n\nMoving RIGHT positions the snake well to potentially target either the apple above it (1, 4) or the apple below and to the right (4, 5) in subsequent moves. Both are 2 steps away after moving RIGHT. Moving UP or LEFT targets only one apple within 2 steps. Therefore, moving RIGHT offers more immediate options.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#  SH  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#   S  #\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 4) and the body is at (3, 4). The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN. Moving UP is not allowed as it's the reverse of DOWN.\n- If I move LEFT, the head goes to (4, 3). This is a valid empty square.\n- If I move RIGHT, the head goes to (4, 5). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move, the snake eats the apple, grows longer, and the score increases.\n- If I move DOWN, the head goes to (5, 4). This is a valid empty square.\n\nThe goal is to eat apples. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple immediately. Let's check if eating the apple leads to a dead end. After moving RIGHT, the head will be at (4, 5), the body will be at (4, 4) and (3, 4). The new direction will be RIGHT. From (4, 5), the snake can move UP to (3, 5) (empty) or DOWN to (5, 5) (empty). Moving RIGHT to (4, 6) hits a wall. So, eating the apple is safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to eat the apple by moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#AA    #\n#   S  #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 5) and the body segments are at (4, 4) and (3, 4).\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot move LEFT (reverse direction).\nThe possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (3, 5). This square is empty (' '). It is not a wall and not part of the snake's body. This move is safe. This move takes the head closer to the apple at (1, 5).\n2.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (5, 5). This square is empty (' '). It is not a wall and not part of the snake's body. This move is safe. This move takes the head further away from the apples.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (4, 6). This square is empty (' '). It is not a wall and not part of the snake's body. This move is safe. This move maintains the row distance to the apple at (1, 5) but increases the column distance.\n\nComparing the options, moving UP is the most direct path towards the nearest apple at (1, 5) and is a safe move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#AA    #\n#    H #\n#   SS #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at coordinates (3, 5) (0-indexed from top-left, inside the walls). The body segments are at (4, 5) and (4, 4). The current direction is UP. Apples are at (1, 5), (2, 1), and (2, 2).\n\nWe need to choose the next direction for the snake. The possible inputs are 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT'.\n\n1.  **Input UP:** The snake continues moving UP. The head will move from (3, 5) to (2, 5). This square is empty. This is a valid move. The next move (still UP) would lead to (1, 5), which contains an apple.\n2.  **Input DOWN:** The snake cannot reverse direction. Since the current direction is UP, DOWN is an invalid input.\n3.  **Input LEFT:** The snake turns LEFT. The head will move from (3, 5) to (3, 4). This square is empty. This is a valid move. This move positions the snake towards the apples at (2, 1) and (2, 2).\n4.  **Input RIGHT:** The snake turns RIGHT. The head will move from (3, 5) to (3, 6). This square is a wall ('#'). This move leads to a collision and game over.\n\nComparing valid moves UP and LEFT:\n- Moving UP positions the snake to eat the apple at (1, 5) in the following step. After eating the apple, the snake can safely turn LEFT.\n- Moving LEFT positions the snake towards the other two apples but delays eating an apple.\n\nChoosing UP leads to an immediate advantage (eating an apple soon) and appears safe. Therefore, continuing UP is the best move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#AA  H #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nThe snake head is at (2, 5) and is moving UP.\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move to (1, 5). This cell contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move. Eating the apple increases the score and snake length. The snake will occupy (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5).\n2.  LEFT: Move to (2, 4). This cell is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  RIGHT: Move to (2, 6). This cell is a wall ('#'). This is an invalid move (collision).\n4.  DOWN: The snake is moving UP, so it cannot reverse direction to DOWN. This is an invalid move.\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n- Moving UP eats an apple immediately, increasing the score. The position after moving UP (1, 5) allows a subsequent safe move LEFT to (1, 4).\n- Moving LEFT is safe but does not eat an apple immediately. It positions the snake closer to the apples at (2, 1) and (2, 2).\n\nEating an apple is the primary goal. Moving UP achieves this immediately and the subsequent position is safe. Therefore, moving UP is the best move.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#    H #\n#AA  S #\n#    S #\n#    SA#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1, 5) (row 1, column 5, 0-indexed inside the walls).\nThe current direction is UP.\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  **UP:** Moving UP would hit the wall '#' at (0, 5). This leads to game over.\n2.  **DOWN:** The snake cannot reverse direction directly from UP to DOWN. This move is invalid.\n3.  **LEFT:** Moving LEFT would move the head to (1, 4), which is an empty space '.'. This is a valid and safe move.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Moving RIGHT would hit the wall '#' at (1, 6). This leads to game over.\n\nThe only valid and safe move is LEFT. This move avoids collision and allows the snake to continue playing. It also positions the snake to potentially go after the apples on the left side later.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#   HS #\n#AA  S #\n#    S #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBased on the current board state and the goal of eating apples while avoiding collisions, let's analyze the possible moves:\n\n1.  **UP:** Moving UP would lead the head (H at row 1, col 4) to collide with the wall ('#') at row 0, col 4. This results in game over.\n2.  **DOWN:** Moving DOWN would move the head to row 2, col 4. This square is empty (' '). This move is safe and positions the head closer to the row containing the two apples ('A') on the left.\n3.  **LEFT:** Moving LEFT would move the head to row 1, col 3. This square is empty (' '). This move is safe.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Moving RIGHT is not allowed because it is the direct opposite of the current direction (LEFT).\n\nComparing the safe moves (DOWN and LEFT):\n- Moving DOWN positions the head at (2, 4), closer to the apples at (2, 0) and (2, 1).\n- Moving LEFT positions the head at (1, 3), further from the apples.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is the more strategic choice as it moves towards the nearest apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#   SS #\n#AA HS #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 10\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 4).

This move is valid. It positions the snake closer to the apples at (2, 1) and (2, 2).\n2.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (2, 5). This square is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This move leads to a collision and is invalid.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head moves to (3, 4). This square is empty. This move is valid. It moves the snake away from the nearby apples.\n\nComparing valid moves: Moving LEFT brings the snake closer to two apples, making it a better strategic move than moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#   SS #\n#AAHS  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 3).\nThe snake's body 'S' is at (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5).\nApples 'A' are at (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 6).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot turn RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\n1.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (2, 2). This square contains an apple 'A'. The snake eats the apple, grows, and the score increases. This move is safe (no collision with walls or self).\n2.  Move UP: The head moves to (1, 3). This square is empty. This move is safe.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head moves to (3, 3). This square is empty. This move is safe.\n\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is the primary goal. It also positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (2, 1) in the next step. Therefore, moving LEFT is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#   SS #\n#AHSS  #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nThe snake's head is at (2, 2).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, and LEFT.

This is a safe move.\n3.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (2, 1), which contains an apple ('A'). This is a safe move and results in eating an apple, increasing the score and snake length.\n\nEating an apple is beneficial. Moving LEFT achieves this immediately and safely.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#   SS #\n#HSSS  #\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 13\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 1) (row 2, column 1, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, and LEFT. Moving RIGHT is not allowed as it's the reverse of LEFT.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The snake's head would move to (2, 0). This position contains a wall '#'. This move leads to a collision and ends the game.\n2.  **Move UP:** The snake's head would move to (1, 1). This position is empty '.'. This is a valid move. The snake would not eat an apple.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The snake's head would move to (3, 1). This position contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move. The snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase.\n\nComparing the valid moves (UP and DOWN):\n- Moving UP keeps the snake alive but doesn't score.\n- Moving DOWN keeps the snake alive, scores a point by eating an apple, and increases the snake's length.\n\nEating the apple is beneficial. Let's check if moving DOWN leads to an immediate trap. After moving DOWN, the head will be at (3, 1), and the direction will be DOWN. The snake's body will occupy (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5). The next possible moves would be LEFT (wall), RIGHT (empty at 3, 2), or DOWN (empty at 4, 1). There are safe subsequent moves.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is the best option as it leads to eating an apple and doesn't cause immediate collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#   SS #\n#SSSS  #\n#H A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 14\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3, 1).

Valid.\n\nEvaluate valid moves:\n*   DOWN: Moves the snake towards the lower part of the board, closer to the apple at (6, 5). Keeps the snake in open space.\n*   RIGHT: Moves the snake towards the apple at (4, 6). Also keeps the option to move DOWN towards the apple at (6, 5).\n\nBoth moves are safe. Moving RIGHT seems slightly more proactive as it moves towards the closest reachable apple at (4, 6) on the same row. It also preserves the option to go DOWN later for the apple at (6, 5).\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#SSSS  #\n#S A   #\n#SH   A#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 3). The current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot move LEFT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n1.  Move UP: The head moves to (3, 3). This square contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move, eats an apple, increases score and length.\n2.  Move DOWN: The head moves to (5, 3). This square is empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (4, 4). This square is empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is the primary goal. This move is safe and does not lead to an immediate collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#SSS   #\n#SHA   #\n#SS   A#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 17\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 2). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT (DOWN is forbidden as it's the reverse direction).\n\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (2, 2). This position is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This leads to a collision and game over.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (3, 1). This position is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This leads to a collision and game over.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (3, 3). This position contains an apple ('A'). The snake will eat the apple, increase its length, and the game continues. This is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nTherefore, the only viable move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n# A    #\n#SSS   #\n#SSH   #\n#SS   A#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 18\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 4) (row index 3, column index 4, using 0-based indexing inside the walls).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot move LEFT (reversing direction).\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **UP:** Move to (2, 4). This square is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). Collision. Invalid move.\n2.  **DOWN:** Move to (4, 4). This square is empty (' '). Valid move.\n3.  **RIGHT:** Move to (3, 5). This square is empty (' '). Valid move.\n\nWe need to choose between DOWN and RIGHT.\nApples are located at (1, 1), (4, 6), and (6, 6). The nearest reachable apple is at (4, 6).\n\n*   If we move **DOWN** to (4, 4): The snake is positioned to move towards the apple at (4, 6) by subsequently moving RIGHT, RIGHT. It also moves towards the apple at (6, 6).\n*   If we move **RIGHT** to (3, 5): The snake is positioned to move towards the apple at (4, 6) by subsequently moving DOWN then RIGHT, or RIGHT then DOWN.\n\nBoth moves are safe and allow progress towards the nearest apple at (4, 6). Moving RIGHT keeps the snake's head higher on the board, potentially allowing easier access to the apple at (1, 1) later, and offers slightly more flexibility in the next step to reach the apple at (4, 6). Therefore, moving RIGHT is a good choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n# A    #\n#SS    #\n#SSSH  #\n#SS   A#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake head is at (3, 5). The current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot move LEFT (reversing direction).\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP**: Head moves to (2, 5). This square is empty. Valid and safe. This moves towards the apple at (1, 1).\n2.  **Move DOWN**: Head moves to (4, 5). This square is empty. Valid and safe. This moves towards the apple at (4, 6) and (6, 5).\n3.  **Move RIGHT**: Head moves to (3, 6). This square is empty. Valid and safe. This also moves towards the apple at (4, 6).\n\nComparing DOWN and RIGHT:\n- Moving DOWN to (4, 5): The next move could be RIGHT to (4, 6) to eat the apple. After eating, the head is at (4, 6), closer to the apple at (6, 5).\n- Moving RIGHT to (3, 6): The next move could be DOWN to (4, 6) to eat the apple. After eating, the head is at (4, 6), closer to the apple at (6, 5).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT lead to eating the apple at (4, 6) in the next step. Moving DOWN places the head at (4, 5) initially, which is closer row-wise to the apple at (6, 5). Moving UP leads towards the apple at (1, 1) but away from the two closer apples.\n\nChoosing DOWN positions the snake better to pursue the apple at (4, 6) immediately and then potentially the one at (6, 5).\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n# A    #\n#S     #\n#SSSS  #\n#SS H A#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 20\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 4). The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN (cannot move UP as it's the reverse of DOWN).\n\n1.  **Check move LEFT:** The position to the left of the head (4, 3) contains 'S' (snake body). Moving LEFT would result in a collision with the snake itself. This move is invalid.\n2.  **Check move RIGHT:** The position to the right of the head (4, 5) is empty (' '). This move is valid and safe. It moves the snake towards the apple 'A' at (4, 6).\n3.  **Check move DOWN:** The position below the head (5, 4) is empty (' '). This move is valid and safe. It moves the snake towards the apple 'A' at (6, 6).\n\nComparing RIGHT and DOWN:\n- Moving RIGHT positions the snake to eat the apple at (4, 6) in the next step.\n- Moving DOWN positions the snake further away from the apple at (4, 6) but closer to the one at (6, 6).\n\nGoing for the closer apple is generally a good strategy. The apple at (4, 6) is closer (2 steps away: RIGHT, RIGHT) than the apple at (6, 6) (at least 3 steps away). Therefore, moving RIGHT is the better immediate move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#SSSS  #\n#SS SHA#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 21\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 5) (row 4, column 5, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves:\n1.  **RIGHT:** Move to (4, 6). This contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move, eats an apple, and increases the score. The snake grows.\n2.  **UP:** Move to (3, 5). This contains a snake body part 'S'. This move leads to a collision and game over.\n3.  **DOWN:** Move to (5, 5). This is an empty space ' '. This is a valid move.\n4.  **LEFT:** Cannot move LEFT because the current direction is RIGHT (reversing direction is forbidden).\n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately without colliding with walls or itself. Moving DOWN is safe but misses the immediate apple. Moving UP results in a game over. Therefore, moving RIGHT is the best move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#SSSS  #\n#SS SSH#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 22\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head is at coordinates (4, 7) (0-indexed, top-left is 0,0). The current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT. The snake cannot move LEFT because it's the reverse of the current direction.\n1. Check move RIGHT: The position (4, 8) is a wall ('#'). This move leads to collision. Invalid.\n2. Check move UP: The position (3, 7) is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n3. Check move DOWN: The position (5, 7) is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n\nBoth UP and DOWN are safe moves.\n- Moving UP to (3, 7) allows potential access to the apples at (1, 2) and (1, 5) by subsequently moving LEFT.\n- Moving DOWN to (5, 7) allows potential access to the apple at (6, 6) by subsequently moving DOWN and then LEFT.\n\nBoth are viable paths. Moving DOWN seems slightly more direct towards the nearest apple at (6, 6). Let's choose DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n#SS SSS#\n#     H#\n#     A#\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n#SS SSS#\n# A   S#\n#     H#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 24\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\nThe snake's head is at (6, 6).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP because it's the reverse direction.\nMoving RIGHT would lead to (6, 7), which is a wall '#'. This causes a collision.\nMoving DOWN would lead to (7, 6), which is a wall '#'. This causes a collision.\nMoving LEFT would lead to (6, 5), which is an empty space ' '. This is a safe move.\n\nTherefore, the only valid move to avoid immediate collision is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n# S SSS#\n# A   S#\n#    HS#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 25\n\nMy current position (Head 'H') is at row 6, column 4 (0-indexed from top-left).\nMy current direction is LEFT.\nI cannot move RIGHT because it's the reverse direction.\nLet's check the other possible moves:\n1.  **UP:** Move to row 5, column 4. This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  **DOWN:** Move to row 7, column 4. This square is a wall ('#'). This is an invalid move (collision).\n3.  **LEFT:** Move to row 6, column 3. This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nI have two valid moves: UP and LEFT.\nThere is an apple 'A' at (5, 1).\nMoving UP to (5, 4) gets me closer vertically to the general area of the apples.\nMoving LEFT to (6, 3) gets me closer horizontally to the apple at (5, 1).\n\nLet's consider the path to the nearest apple at (5, 1):\n- If I move UP: (6, 4) -> UP (5, 4). Next moves could be LEFT (5, 3), LEFT (5, 2), LEFT (5, 1) to get the apple. This path seems clear.\n- If I move LEFT: (6, 4) -> LEFT (6, 3). Next moves could be UP (5, 3), LEFT (5, 2), LEFT (5, 1) to get the apple. This path also seems clear.\n\nBoth moves are safe and allow progress towards an apple. Moving UP positions the snake slightly higher on the board, potentially offering better access to the two apples in row 1 later. It also moves away from the bottom wall immediately. Therefore, UP seems like a reasonable choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n#   SSS#\n# A  HS#\n#    SS#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 26\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 5). The current direction is UP. The snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction). The possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Check Move UP:** The cell at (4, 5) contains 'S' (part of the snake's body). Moving UP would result in a collision with the snake's body. This move leads to game over.\n2.  **Check Move LEFT:** The cell at (5, 4) contains ' ' (empty space). Moving LEFT is a valid move. The snake's head will move to (5, 4).\n3.  **Check Move RIGHT:** The cell at (5, 6) contains 'S' (part of the snake's body). Moving RIGHT would result in a collision with the snake's body. This move leads to game over.\n\nThe only valid move that does not result in immediate game over is LEFT. Moving LEFT allows the snake to continue playing.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#   SSS#\n# A HSS#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 27\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 3).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nPossible next moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.

Check move DOWN: The position (6, 3) is empty. Moving DOWN is a valid move.\n3.  Check move LEFT: The position (5, 2) is empty. Moving LEFT is a valid move.\n\nComparing valid moves DOWN and LEFT:\n- Moving DOWN to (6, 3) moves the snake away from the nearest apple at (5, 1).\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 2) moves the snake towards the apple at (5, 1). The next move could be LEFT again to eat the apple.\n\nTo maximize the score by eating apples, moving LEFT is the better immediate choice as it positions the snake to eat the apple at (5, 1) in the next step.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#   SSS#\n# AHSSS#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 28\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 2).\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT.\nThe possible next moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving RIGHT is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n\n1.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (5, 1). This square contains an apple 'A'. Eating the apple is good (increases score and length). The square is not a wall or part of the snake's body. This is a safe and beneficial move.\n2.  Move UP: The head moves to (4, 2). This square is empty. It is not a wall or part of the snake's body. This is a safe move, but doesn't eat an apple immediately.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head moves to (6, 2). This square is empty. It is not a wall or part of the snake's body. This is a safe move, but doesn't eat an apple immediately.\n\nComparing the options, moving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately and safely.

Turn DOWN: The snake would move to (6, 1). This square is empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n4.  Turn RIGHT: This is the reverse of the current direction (LEFT), so it's an invalid move.\n\nComparing valid moves (UP and DOWN):\n- Moving UP to (4, 1): This moves the snake towards the apple at (1, 1). Following this path (UP, UP, UP, UP) leads to eating the apple at (1,1), but the next move would be into the wall at (0,1).\n- Moving DOWN to (6, 1): This moves the snake towards the apple at (6, 3). Following this path (DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT) leads to eating the apple at (6,3). After eating, the head is at (6,3), direction is RIGHT, and the next move RIGHT to (6,4) is safe.\n\nMoving DOWN leads to an apple safely in the short term, while the most direct path after moving UP leads to a trap after eating the apple.

The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving DOWN is not allowed as it reverses the current direction.\n1.  **Move UP:** The snake head moves to (3, 3). This position is empty. The apples are at (2, 5), (3, 5), and (5, 2).\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The snake head moves to (4, 2). This position is empty. From here, the snake can move DOWN in the next step to eat the apple at (5, 2).\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The snake head moves to (4, 4). This position is empty. From here, the snake can move UP and then RIGHT to reach the apple at (3, 5).\n\nChoosing LEFT allows the snake to eat the apple at (5, 2) in the very next move (by moving DOWN). This is the quickest way to score points.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n# H    #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nThe snake head is at (4, 1).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe possible next moves are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.\nMoving LEFT would hit the wall at (4, 0), resulting in game over.\nMoving UP would move the head to (3, 1), which is an empty space.\nMoving DOWN would move the head to (5, 1), which contains an apple 'A'. Eating the apple increases the score and the snake's length. This is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nThe snake head is at (5, 2) and the body is at (4, 2). The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN. Moving UP is not allowed as it reverses the current direction.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (5, 1). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move. It moves away from the apples.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (5, 3). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move. It moves towards the apple at (6, 4).\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (6, 2). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move. It continues the current direction and moves towards the apple at (6, 4).\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN move the snake closer to the apple at (6, 4). Moving DOWN maintains the current direction and seems like a safe and reasonable step towards the nearest apple. Let's analyze the path after moving DOWN:\n- Head at (6, 2). Possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT.\n- Move RIGHT to (6, 3).\n- Move RIGHT to (6, 4) to eat the apple.\nThis path takes 3 steps (DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT) to eat the apple.\n\nLet's analyze the path after moving RIGHT:\n- Head at (5, 3). Possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n- Move DOWN to (6, 3).\n- Move RIGHT to (6, 4) to eat the apple.\nThis path also takes 3 steps (RIGHT, DOWN, RIGHT) to eat the apple.\n\nSince both moves lead to the nearest apple in the same number of steps and are safe, choosing DOWN maintains the current momentum and is a good option.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H A  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nThe snake's head is at (6, 2) and the body is at (5, 2).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\nMoving UP is not allowed (reversing direction).\nMoving DOWN to (7, 2) hits the wall '#'. Game Over.\nMoving LEFT to (6, 1) is safe.\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 3) is safe.\nThere is an apple at (6, 4), which is close. Moving RIGHT brings the snake closer to this apple. Moving LEFT moves away from it.\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is the best move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SHA  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 2), and the body is at (6, 1).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot turn LEFT (reverse direction).\nMoving DOWN would lead to a collision with the wall at (7, 2).\nMoving UP would move the head to (5, 2). This is a valid move.\nContinuing RIGHT would move the head to (6, 3). This is a valid move.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n1.  Move UP: The head moves to (5, 2). The snake becomes H(5,2), S(6,2). This moves away from the nearest apple at (6, 4).\n2.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (6, 3). The snake becomes H(6,3), S(6,2). This moves closer to the apple at (6, 4). The next move could be RIGHT again to eat the apple at (6,4).\n\nChoosing RIGHT allows the snake to move towards the closest apple. This seems like the best strategy.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n# SSH  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at (6, 5).\n- The snake's body ('S') is at (6, 4) and (6, 3).\n- The current direction is RIGHT.\n- Possible next positions for the head:\n    - UP: (5, 5) - Empty space, safe.\n    - DOWN: (7, 5) - Wall ('#'), collision, game over.\n    - LEFT: (6, 4) - Snake body ('S'), collision, game over. Also, reversing direction is not allowed.\n    - RIGHT: (6, 6) - Wall ('#'), collision, game over.\n\nThe only move that avoids collision with walls or the snake's own body is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#  SS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nValid moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. Moving DOWN is not allowed as it reverses the current direction.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head moves from (5, 3) to (4, 3). This square is empty and not a wall or body part. This move is safe and moves the snake vertically closer to the apples located at (2, 4), (3, 4), and (3, 5).\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves from (5, 3) to (5, 2). This square is empty and not a wall or body part. This move is safe but moves the snake away from the apple cluster.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head moves from (5, 3) to (5, 4). This square is empty and not a wall or body part. This move is safe and moves the snake horizontally closer to the apples.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT move the snake towards the apples. Moving UP positions the snake at (4, 3), while moving RIGHT positions it at (5, 4). Moving UP seems slightly better as it keeps the snake more centrally positioned vertically, offering potentially more options for subsequent moves towards the apple cluster without getting too close to the bottom or right edge immediately.\n\nTherefore, UP is a reasonable choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    AA#\n#   H  #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 4) and the body segments are at (5, 4) and (6, 4). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse of UP.\n1.  Move UP: Head moves to (3, 4). This is a safe empty square. It positions the snake closer to the apples at (3, 5) and (3, 6).\n2.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (4, 3). This is a safe empty square, but moves away from the apples.\n3.  Move RIGHT: Head moves to (4, 5). This is a safe empty square. It moves closer to the apple at (3, 6), but might make accessing the apple at (3, 5) slightly more complex immediately.\n\nMoving UP positions the head at (3, 4). From there, a subsequent RIGHT move would lead to eating the apple at (3, 5). This seems like a good strategy to approach the cluster of apples.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#   HAA#\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 9\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\nThe snake's head is at (3, 3).\nThe snake's body is at (4, 3) and (5, 3).\nApples are at (2, 4), (3, 4), and (3, 5).\nThe current direction is UP. The snake cannot move DOWN.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (2, 3). This position is empty and valid. No apple is eaten.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (3, 2). This position is empty and valid. No apple is eaten.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (3, 4). This position contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is a valid move, increases the score, and grows the snake.\n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is the primary objective. This move is safe as it does not collide with walls or the snake's body.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#   SHA#\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#     A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 10\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 4) (row 3, column 4). The body segments are at (3, 3), (4, 3), and (5, 3). The current direction is RIGHT. Apples are at (2, 4), (3, 5), and (6, 6).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  **UP**: The head would move to (2, 4). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move (not opposite to RIGHT). Eating the apple increases the score and length. The new snake configuration would be Head:(2,4), Body:(3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). This move is safe (no collision with walls or self).\n2.  **DOWN**: The head would move to (4, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. The snake moves without eating an apple. The new snake configuration would be Head:(4,4), Body:(3,4), (3,3), (4,3). This move is safe.\n3.  **RIGHT**: The head would move to (3, 5). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move (continuing in the same direction). Eating the apple increases the score and length. The new snake configuration would be Head:(3,5), Body:(3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). This move is safe.\n4.  **LEFT**: This move is invalid because the snake is currently moving RIGHT and cannot immediately reverse direction.\n\nComparing the valid moves: Both UP and RIGHT lead to eating an apple immediately and are safe. Moving DOWN is also safe but doesn't yield a score increase. Eating an apple is the primary goal besides survival. Both UP and RIGHT achieve this. Choosing UP positions the head at (2,4), while choosing RIGHT positions the head at (3,5). Both positions offer clear paths to the remaining apples. Let's choose UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    H #\n#   SSA#\n#   S  #\n#A  S  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 4). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving DOWN is not allowed.\n1.  Move UP: Head moves to (1, 4). This is an empty space. Safe.\n2.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (2, 3). This is an empty space. Safe.\n3.  Move RIGHT: Head moves to (2, 5). This is an empty space. Safe.\n\nApples are located at (3, 5), (5, 0), and (6, 6).\nThe nearest apple is at (3, 5).\n- Moving UP positions the head at (1, 4). Path to (3, 5) would likely involve going RIGHT then DOWN.\n- Moving LEFT positions the head at (2, 3). This moves away from the apple at (3, 5).\n- Moving RIGHT positions the head at (2, 5). From here, the next move could be DOWN to eat the apple at (3, 5).\n\nMoving RIGHT seems the most efficient way to approach the nearest apple. Let's verify the safety of the subsequent move (DOWN):\n- If move RIGHT: Head at (2, 5), Body starts at (2, 4).\n- Next move DOWN: Head moves to (3, 5). This is the apple 'A'. The snake eats the apple. The new head is (3, 5), the body starts at (2, 5). This move is safe and productive.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    SH#\n#   SSA#\n#   S  #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 12\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head is at coordinates (2, 6) (row 2, column 6). The current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT is not possible because the current direction is RIGHT, and moving LEFT would be reversing direction. Also, moving RIGHT would hit a wall.\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (1, 6). This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.\n2.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (3, 6). This space contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move. Eating the apple increases the score and snake length.\n3.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (2, 5). This space contains a snake body segment ('S'). This is an invalid move (collision).\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n- UP leads to a safe square but doesn't eat an apple immediately.\n- DOWN leads to eating an apple, increasing the score and length. The square (3,6) is safe to move into.\n\nEating the apple is beneficial. Therefore, the best move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#      #\n#    SS#\n#  ASSH#\n#   S  #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 13\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1.  **UP:** Invalid, as the current direction is DOWN (cannot reverse).\n2.  **DOWN:** The square below the head 'H' at (3, 6) is (4, 6). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  **LEFT:** The square to the left of the head 'H' at (3, 6) is (3, 5). This square is occupied by the snake's body ('S').

Moving DOWN would lead to (6, 6), which contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move, results in eating the apple, increasing the score, and growing the snake.\n\nTherefore, the only valid and beneficial move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    SS#\n#A A SS#\n#     S#\n#A    S#\n#     H#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 6).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN (cannot move UP because it's the reverse of DOWN).\n\n1.

The current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (5, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (7, 4). This square contains a wall ('#'). This leads to game over.\n3.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (6, 3). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nWe need to choose between UP and LEFT. Let's analyze the consequences:\n- Moving UP to (5, 4): Puts the head closer vertically to the apples at (3, 1), (3, 3), and (5, 1). From (5, 4), the snake can continue moving UP or turn LEFT or RIGHT (Right hits body 'S' at (5,5)). Moving LEFT from (5,4) leads towards the apple at (5,1). Moving UP from (5,4) leads towards the apple at (3,3).\n- Moving LEFT to (6, 3): Puts the head closer horizontally to the apple at (5, 1). From (6, 3), the snake can continue moving LEFT or turn UP (Down hits wall '#'). Moving UP from (6,3) leads towards both apples (5,1) and (3,3).\n\nMoving UP places the head in a more central position relative to the remaining empty space and closer to the group of apples. It seems slightly more advantageous for future moves.\n\nTherefore, moving UP is a good strategy.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#     S#\n#A A  S#\n#     S#\n#A   HS#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 18\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 5). The current direction is UP.\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), and (2, 6).\nApples 'A' are at (3, 1), (3, 3), and (5, 1).\n\nPossible next moves based on the current direction (UP):\n1.  Continue UP: The head would move to (4, 5). This square is empty (' '). This is a safe move. The snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\n2.  Turn LEFT: The head would move to (5, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a safe move.\n3.  Turn RIGHT: The head would move to (5, 6). This square is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This move leads to a collision and ends the game.\n\nWe must choose between UP and LEFT.\n\nLet's analyze the consequences:\n- Move UP: Head moves to (4, 5). The snake is now closer to the apple at (3, 3). A possible path to this apple is UP -> UP -> LEFT -> LEFT. This path appears safe and keeps the snake body mostly vertical along the right side initially.\n- Move LEFT: Head moves to (5, 4). The snake is closer to the apple at (5, 1) and also has a path towards (3, 3) (e.g., LEFT -> UP -> LEFT -> UP) or (5, 1) (e.g., LEFT -> LEFT -> LEFT -> LEFT).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe moves that position the snake to pursue apples. Continuing UP is a direct move towards the apple at (3,3) while maintaining the current vertical orientation, which seems slightly less risky in terms of self-trapping compared to immediately turning LEFT.\n\nTherefore, continuing UP is a good strategy.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A A  S#\n#    HS#\n#A   SS#\n#    SS#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 19\n\nThe snake's head is at row 4, column 5 (H). The body segments (S) are at (3,6), (4,6), (5,5), (5,6), (6,5), (6,6).\nThe snake is moving UP.\nThe possible next moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. The snake cannot move DOWN as it is the opposite of the current direction.\n\n1.  **Check move RIGHT:** The square to the right of the head (4, 6) is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). Moving RIGHT would cause a collision. This move is invalid.\n2.  **Check move UP:** The square above the head (3, 5) is empty (' '). Moving UP is a valid move. The new head position would be (3, 5).\n3.  **Check move LEFT:** The square to the left of the head (4, 4) is empty (' '). Moving LEFT is a valid move. The new head position would be (4, 4).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are valid moves. Let's analyze the strategic advantage:\nThere are apples at (3, 1), (3, 3), and (5, 1).\n- If moving UP: The head goes to (3, 5). From there, moving LEFT twice leads to the apple at (3, 3).\n- If moving LEFT: The head goes to (4, 4). From there, moving UP and then LEFT leads to the apple at (3, 3).\n\nBoth moves allow the snake to reach the apple at (3, 3) in two subsequent steps. Moving UP continues the current direction and seems like a safe and direct path towards the apple cluster.\n\nTherefore, moving UP is a reasonable choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A A H #\n#    SS#\n#A   SS#\n#    SS#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 20\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3, 6).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP**: The head would move to (2, 6).

This is a wall '#'. This move leads to collision and game over.\n\nValid moves are UP and LEFT.\nMoving LEFT brings the snake's head to (3, 5), which is closer to the apple at (3, 3).\nMoving UP brings the snake's head to (2, 6), moving further away from the apples.\n\nTo maximize the score by eating apples, moving towards an apple is generally a good strategy. Moving LEFT allows the snake to potentially reach the apple at (3, 3) in two more steps (LEFT, LEFT).\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A AHS #\n#    S #\n#A   SS#\n#    SS#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 5). The current direction is LEFT.\nPossible next moves:\n1.  Keep going LEFT: Move to (3, 4). This square is empty. This is a valid and safe move. It moves the snake closer to the apple at (3, 3).\n2.  Change direction to UP: Move to (2, 5). This square is empty. This is a valid and safe move.\n3.  Change direction to DOWN: Move to (4, 5). This square contains a snake body part 'S'. This move would result in a collision and end the game.\n4.  Change direction to RIGHT: This is not allowed because the snake cannot reverse its direction (current direction is LEFT).\n\nComparing safe moves LEFT and UP:\n- Moving LEFT puts the head at (3, 4). The next move LEFT would eat the apple at (3, 3). This is a direct path to the nearest apple.\n- Moving UP puts the head at (2, 5). From there, several moves (e.g., LEFT, LEFT, DOWN) would be needed to reach the apple at (3, 3).\n\nMoving LEFT is the most direct path towards an apple and appears safe.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#A HSS #\n#    S #\n#A   SS#\n#    SS#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 3).

This move positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (3, 1) in the next step.\n\nComparing the moves:\n- Moving UP or DOWN moves the snake away from the nearest apples at (3, 1) and (5, 1).\n- Moving LEFT positions the snake to eat the apple at (3, 1) in the subsequent move.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (cannot move UP).\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The snake head would move to (5, 1). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The snake head would move to (5, 3). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The snake head would move to (6, 2). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the moves based on proximity to apples and available space:\n- Apples are at (2, 3), (2, 6), and (3, 5).\n- Moving LEFT (to 5, 1) moves away from the cluster of apples.\n- Moving DOWN (to 6, 2) moves away from the apples and closer to the bottom wall, potentially limiting future movement.\n- Moving RIGHT (to 5, 3) moves towards the apples at (3, 5) and (2, 6). This seems like a good strategic move to get closer to food while maintaining space. After moving RIGHT to (5, 3), the next possible moves would be RIGHT (to 5, 4) or DOWN (to 6, 3), as UP (to 4, 3) would hit the snake's body. This path keeps options open towards the apples.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is the best option.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#    A #\n# S    #\n# SH   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head is at (5, 3) (row 5, column 3). The body segments are at (5, 2) and (4, 2). The current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT. LEFT is invalid as it's the reverse of RIGHT.\n1.  Moving RIGHT: The head would move to (5, 4). This is empty and safe. It moves towards the apple at (3, 5).\n2.  Moving UP: The head would move to (4, 3). This is empty and safe. It moves towards the apple at (2, 3).\n3.  Moving DOWN: The head would move to (6, 3). This is empty and safe. It moves away from all apples.\n\nComparing UP and RIGHT:\n- Moving UP leads towards the apple at (2, 3). The path could be UP -> UP -> UP (eat apple at (2,3)). This takes 3 moves.\n- Moving RIGHT leads towards the apple at (3, 5). The path could be RIGHT -> UP -> UP -> RIGHT (eat apple at (3,5)). This takes 4 moves.\n\nMoving UP allows the snake to reach an apple one step sooner than moving RIGHT. Therefore, UP is the preferred move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n# SS   #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nMy analysis:\n1.  The snake's head is at (4, 3). The body segments are at (5, 3) and (5, 2).\n2.  The current direction is UP. The snake cannot move DOWN.\n3.  Possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n4.  Move UP: The head moves to (3, 3). This square is empty. It is a valid move. This move positions the snake one step away from the apple at (3, 4).\n5.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (4, 2). This square is empty. It is a valid move.\n6.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (4, 4). This square is empty. It is a valid move. This move also positions the snake one step away from the apple at (3, 4).\n7.  Choosing UP allows the snake to potentially move RIGHT on the next turn to eat the apple at (3, 4). This seems like a reasonable strategy to get closer to an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#  H A #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head is at (3, 3). The body segments are at (4, 3) and (5, 3). The current direction is UP. The apples are at (2, 3), (2, 6), and (3, 6).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  **UP**: Move to (2, 3). This square contains an apple ('A'). This move is valid as it's not a wall or the snake's body. Eating the apple increases the score and length. The snake cannot reverse, but UP is not the reverse of UP.\n2.  **LEFT**: Move to (3, 2). This square is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n3.  **RIGHT**: Move to (3, 4). This square is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n4.  **DOWN**: Invalid move, as the snake cannot reverse its direction (current direction is UP).\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n-   Moving UP allows the snake to eat the apple at (2, 3) immediately. This is the primary objective. After moving UP, the head will be at (2, 3), the body will extend to (3, 3), (4, 3), and (5, 3). The path forward (UP to (1, 3), LEFT to (2, 2), RIGHT to (2, 4)) remains open.\n-   Moving LEFT or RIGHT delays eating the apple at (2, 3) but might position the snake better for the other apples. However, getting the immediate score and length increase is usually preferable.\n\nThe best move is to go UP to eat the apple directly in front of the snake.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  H  A#\n#  S A #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#A     #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at row 2, column 3.\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies (3, 3), (4, 3), and (5, 3).\nApples 'A' are at (2, 6), (3, 5), and (6, 1).\nThe current direction is UP.\n\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. DOWN is not allowed as it reverses the current direction.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (1, 3). This position is empty and not a wall or body part. It's a valid move.\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (2, 2). This position is empty and not a wall or body part. It's a valid move.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (2, 4). This position is empty and not a wall or body part. It's a valid move.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n- Moving UP takes the snake away from all apples.\n- Moving LEFT takes the snake away from the apples at (2, 6) and (3, 5), but slightly towards the column of the apple at (6, 1).\n- Moving RIGHT takes the snake towards the apples at (2, 6) and (3, 5). Moving to (2, 4) puts the snake closer to these two apples. From (2, 4), moving RIGHT again would reach (2, 5), adjacent to the apple at (2, 6). Alternatively, from (2, 4), moving DOWN would reach (3, 4), adjacent to the apple at (3, 5).\n\nMoving RIGHT provides the best immediate opportunity to approach and potentially eat an apple in the next few moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  SH A#\n#  S A #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (2, 4).\nThe snake body 'S' occupies positions (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3).\nApples 'A' are at positions (2, 6), (3, 5), (6, 1).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot move LEFT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (1, 4). This is an empty space and a valid move. It moves away from the two nearby apples.\n2.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (3, 4). This is an empty space and a valid move. This positions the snake to potentially move RIGHT to eat the apple at (3, 5) in the next step.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (2, 5). This is an empty space and a valid move. This positions the snake to potentially move RIGHT again to eat the apple at (2, 6) or move DOWN to eat the apple at (3, 5) in the next step.\n\nMoving RIGHT keeps options open for two nearby apples and continues the current direction towards one of them. Moving DOWN focuses on the apple at (3, 5). Moving RIGHT seems slightly more flexible and targets the closest apple in the current direction.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#      #\n#  SSHA#\n#  S A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nAvailable moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT (cannot move LEFT as it's the reverse of RIGHT).\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (1, 5). This is an empty space, so it's a valid move. No apple eaten.\n2.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (3, 5). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move. The snake will eat the apple, grow, and the score will increase.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (2, 6). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move. The snake will eat the apple, grow, and the score will increase.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT lead to eating an apple immediately.\n- If we move DOWN, the new head position is (3, 5) and the direction becomes DOWN. The adjacent apple at (3, 6) can be eaten by moving RIGHT next.\n- If we move RIGHT, the new head position is (2, 6) and the direction becomes RIGHT. The adjacent apple at (3, 6) can be eaten by moving DOWN next.\n\nBoth paths seem good. Let's choose DOWN to move towards the center of the board slightly more.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  SSSA#\n#  S H #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 10\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 4). The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves:\n1.  Keep going DOWN: The head would move to (4, 4), which is empty and safe.\n2.  Turn LEFT: The head would move to (3, 3), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This leads to collision and game over. This move is invalid.\n3.  Turn RIGHT: The head would move to (3, 5), which is empty and safe.\n4.  Turn UP: Cannot reverse direction from DOWN to UP.\n\nWe must choose between DOWN and RIGHT.\nApples are located at (2, 6), (5, 6), and (6, 1).\nThe closest apple is at (2, 6).\n- Moving DOWN to (4, 4) increases the distance to the closest apple (2, 6).\n- Moving RIGHT to (3, 5) decreases the distance to the closest apple (2, 6).\n\nTherefore, turning RIGHT is the best move as it is safe and moves towards the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  SSSA#\n#    SH#\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nAnalysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (3, 6) (row 3, column 6, 0-indexed from top-left). The snake's body 'S' occupies (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), and (2, 3). The current direction is RIGHT. Apples 'A' are at (2, 6), (5, 6), and (6, 1). The snake's length is 5.\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  **UP**: The head would move to (2, 6). This square contains an apple 'A'. This move is valid (not a wall or self-collision). Eating the apple increases the score and snake length. The new head position would be (2, 6), and the new direction would be UP. This seems like a good move as it achieves the objective of eating an apple.\n2.  **DOWN**: The head would move to (4, 6). This square is empty ' '. This move is valid. The new head position would be (4, 6), and the new direction would be DOWN. This move is safe but doesn't immediately eat an apple, though it moves towards the apple at (5, 6).\n3.  **LEFT**: This move is invalid because the snake cannot reverse its direction (current direction is RIGHT).\n4.  **RIGHT**: The head would move to (3, 7). This square is a wall '#'. This move is invalid due to collision.\n\nComparing valid moves UP and DOWN:\n- Moving UP results in immediately eating an apple at (2, 6), increasing the score and length. The subsequent position seems safe, although the path might be slightly constrained initially.\n- Moving DOWN is safe and positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (5, 6) in the next move. It keeps more immediate path options open compared to UP.\n\nSince the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, and the UP move achieves this immediately without leading to an immediate dead end, moving UP is the preferred choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  SSSH#\n# A  SS#\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A     #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at row 2, column 6 (H).\nThe current direction is UP.\nPossible moves:\n1.

The snake's head ('H') is at position (1, 6) (row 1, column 6, 0-indexed from top-left).\n2.  The current direction is UP. This means the snake will attempt to move to (0, 6) if no other direction is given.\n3.  The snake's body ('S') occupies positions: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6).\n4.  The walls ('#') surround the 6x6 playable area.\n5.  Apples ('A') are at (3, 1), (5, 6), and (6, 0).\n6.  The snake cannot reverse direction. Since the current direction is UP, the snake cannot move DOWN.\n\nEvaluate possible moves:\n1.  Continue UP: Move to (0, 6). This position is a wall ('#'). Collision -> Game Over.\n2.  Turn LEFT: Move to (1, 5). This position is empty ('.'). It is not a wall or part of the snake's body. Valid move.\n3.  Turn RIGHT: Move to (1, 7). This position is a wall ('#'). Collision -> Game Over.\n4.  Turn DOWN: This move is invalid because the current direction is UP (cannot reverse 180 degrees).\n\nBased on the evaluation, the only valid move that avoids immediate collision is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#    HS#\n#    SS#\n# A  SS#\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A     #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 14\n\nThe snake head is at coordinates (1, 4) (row 1, column 4, using 0-based indexing from the top-left inside the walls).

This is a valid move.\n2.  **Check UP:** Move to (0, 4). This square is a wall ('#'). This is an invalid move (collision).\n3.  **Check DOWN:** Move to (2, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are valid moves. Let's consider the strategic implications:\n-   **Moving LEFT:** The head moves to (1, 3). This path leads towards the apples at (3, 1) and (6, 1). From (1, 3), the snake could continue LEFT or turn DOWN, offering flexibility.\n-   **Moving DOWN:** The head moves to (2, 4). The snake's body is at (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4). From (2, 4), the only valid next move would be LEFT to (2, 3), as moving RIGHT to (2, 5) or DOWN to (3, 4) would cause a collision with the snake's body. This path seems more immediately restrictive.\n\nMoving LEFT keeps more options open for subsequent moves and positions the snake to pursue the apples on the left side of the board. Therefore, LEFT is the preferred move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#   HSS#\n#     S#\n# A  SS#\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A     #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 15\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\nThe snake's head is at (1, 4). Its body segments are at (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), and (3, 5).\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\n1.  **UP:** Moving UP would cause the head to move to (0, 4), which is a wall '#'. This results in a collision and game over.\n2.  **LEFT:** Moving LEFT would move the head to (1, 3). This square is empty, so the move is valid.\n3.  **DOWN:** Moving DOWN would move the head to (2, 4). This square is empty, so the move is valid.\n\nComparing valid moves (LEFT and DOWN):\n- Moving LEFT positions the head at (1, 3). This moves the snake further into the top part of the board, potentially closer to the top-left corner.\n- Moving DOWN positions the head at (2, 4). This moves the snake towards the center of the board and keeps more open space around it. It also positions the snake slightly better to approach the apple at (3, 1) or (5, 6) in subsequent moves.\n\nStrategically, moving DOWN appears safer and provides more flexibility for future moves compared to moving LEFT, which leads towards a more confined area.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#   SSS#\n#   H S#\n# A   S#\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 3).

This would cause a collision.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (6, 3), which is an empty space. This is a valid move.\n\nSince UP and DOWN lead to collision and LEFT is disallowed, the only valid move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#    AA#\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n# S    #\n#SS   A#\n#SSH   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 3).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT is not allowed.\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move to (5, 3). This is an empty square '.'. This move is valid.\n2.  DOWN: Move to (7, 3). This is a wall '#'. This move is invalid (collision).\n3.  RIGHT: Move to (6, 4). This is an empty square '.'. This move is valid.\n\nLet's evaluate the valid moves:\n-   Moving RIGHT to (6, 4) is safe. It moves towards the apple at (5, 6).\n-   Moving UP to (5, 3) is safe. It moves towards the apples at (1, 4) and (1, 5).\n\nMoving UP positions the snake better to target the two apples in the upper area and maintains flexibility. Moving RIGHT heads towards the single apple at (5, 6) but might limit future options slightly more. Therefore, UP is a good strategic move.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#    AA#\n#      #\n# SS   #\n# S    #\n#SSH  A#\n#SSS   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 26\n\nYour current position is H at (5, 4). Your current direction is UP.\nThe possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. You cannot move DOWN because it's the reverse of UP.\n\n1.  **Check Move LEFT:** The square at (5, 3) contains 'S' (part of your snake body). Moving LEFT would result in a collision. This move is invalid.\n2.  **Check Move UP:** The square at (4, 4) is empty (' '). Moving UP is a valid move. The new head position would be (4, 4), and the direction would remain UP. This moves you further into the center of the board.\n3.  **Check Move RIGHT:** The square at (5, 5) is empty (' '). Moving RIGHT is a valid move. The new head position would be (5, 5), and the direction would change to RIGHT. This moves you closer to the apple at (5, 6).\n\nComparing valid moves UP and RIGHT:\n- Moving UP to (4, 4) keeps you moving towards the upper part of the board where apples (1, 4) and (1, 5) are located. Reaching (1, 4) would take several more UP moves.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 5) changes your direction to RIGHT. From (5, 5), you can move RIGHT again in the next step to eat the apple at (5, 6). This allows you to eat an apple in just two steps.\n\nEating an apple sooner is generally better. Let's quickly check if eating the apple at (5, 6) leads to a trap.\n- Move RIGHT (to 5, 5). Direction RIGHT.\n- Move RIGHT (to 5, 6). Eat apple. Direction RIGHT. Snake grows. Head at (5, 6).\n- Possible next moves from (5, 6) are UP (to 4, 6, empty), DOWN (to 6, 6, empty), or RIGHT (to 5, 7, wall '#').\n- You must turn either UP or DOWN after eating the apple. Both options seem safe for the immediate next move.\n\nSince moving RIGHT leads to capturing an apple quickly and doesn't create an immediate inescapable trap, it is the preferred move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#    AA#\n#      #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n#SSSH A#\n#SSS   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 27\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 5) (row 5, column 5, using 0-based indexing from the top-left corner inside the walls). The current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot move LEFT. The possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP**: The head would move to (4, 5). This position is empty (' '). This move is safe.\n2.  **Move DOWN**: The head would move to (6, 5). This position is empty (' '). This move is safe.\n3.  **Move RIGHT**: The head would move to (5, 6). This position contains an apple ('A'). This move is safe and results in eating the apple, increasing the score and snake length.\n\nEating an apple is the primary objective besides survival. Moving RIGHT achieves this immediately. Therefore, moving RIGHT is the best move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#SSSSHA#\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head 'H' is at row 5, column 6. The snake's body is 'S'. Apples are 'A'. Walls are '#'.\nPossible moves:\n1.  RIGHT: The square at (5, 7) contains an apple 'A'. Moving here will eat the apple, increase the score, and grow the snake. This is a valid move as it's not a wall or the snake's body.\n2.  UP: The square at (4, 6) is empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n3.  DOWN: The square at (6, 6) is empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n4.  LEFT: The square at (5, 5) contains a snake body segment 'S'. Moving here would cause a collision and end the game. This is not a valid move.\n\nComparing the valid moves, moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is the primary goal besides survival. Moving UP or DOWN is safe but doesn't yield an immediate reward. Therefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#SSSSSH#\n#SSS  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent head position: (5, 6)\nApples locations: (1, 4), (1, 5), (6, 5)\nSnake body locations: (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move head to (4, 6). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  DOWN: Move head to (6, 6). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  LEFT: Move head to (5, 5). This square contains 'S'. This is a collision with the snake's body. Also, the current direction is RIGHT, so moving LEFT is reversing direction. This is an invalid move.\n4.  RIGHT: Move head to (5, 7). This square contains a wall ('#'). This is a collision with the wall. This is an invalid move.\n\nValid moves are UP and DOWN.\n\nLet's analyze the consequences:\n- If we move UP: The head will be at (4, 6). The snake will be moving UP. The closest apple at (6, 5) becomes harder to reach immediately. Access to apples at (1, 4) and (1, 5) might improve, but requires navigation.\n- If we move DOWN: The head will be at (6, 6). The snake will be moving DOWN. From (6, 6), the next valid move would be LEFT to (6, 5), which contains an apple. This move leads directly towards eating an apple in the following step.\n\nChoosing DOWN allows the snake to eat the apple at (6, 5) in the next turn. This aligns with the goal of eating as many apples as possible.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n# S  A #\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSS  H#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 30\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6, 6). The current direction is DOWN.\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1.  Move DOWN: The snake would move to (7, 6), which is a wall '#'. This results in a collision and game over.\n2.  Move LEFT: The snake would move to (6, 5), which is occupied by its own body 'S'. This results in a collision and game over.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The snake would move to (6, 7), which is a wall '#'. This results in a collision and game over.\n4.  Move UP: The current direction is DOWN. According to the rules, the snake cannot reverse direction directly (DOWN to UP). This move is invalid.\n\nAll permissible moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) lead to the snake colliding with either a wall or its own body, resulting in game over. Since I must provide a direction, I will choose one of the moves that are allowed by the direction rules, even though it leads to a loss. I choose LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSS HS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 31\n\nBased on the current game board and rules:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6, 5).\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies the following positions: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so moving RIGHT is not allowed.\nThe possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nLet's analyze the consequences of each possible move:\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (5, 5). This position is currently occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This results in a collision with itself. Game Over.\n2.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (7, 5). This position is a wall ('#'). This results in a collision with the wall. Game Over.\n3.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (6, 4). This position is currently occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This results in a collision with itself. Game Over.\n\nAll possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) lead to a game over situation. Since the game will end regardless of the move chosen, any of these three directions is a technically valid input, although none achieve the goal of continuing the game or eating more apples. As a player aiming towards the apples (located in the upper part of the board), moving UP is a choice directed towards that region, even though it results in immediate collision.\n\nAnswer: UP"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#    SS#\n# SSSSH#\n# SSSSA#\n# A  SS#\n#    AS#\n#     S#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 38\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"LEFT","response":["```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AA   #\n#  H   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n```\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n1.  Move UP: Head moves to (2, 4). Safe, but doesn't approach an apple directly.\n2.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (3, 3). Safe. This position is adjacent to the apple at (3, 2). The next move LEFT would eat the apple.\n3.  Move RIGHT: Head moves to (3, 5). Safe, but moves away from the closest apple.\n4.  Move DOWN: Not allowed, as it's the reverse of the current direction UP.\n\nMoving LEFT positions the snake to eat the apple at (3, 2) in the subsequent move. This appears to be the most advantageous move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# HS   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 1), and the body segments are at (3, 2) and (4, 2). The current direction is LEFT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n1.  Move UP: Head moves to (2, 1). This is an empty space, a valid move.\n2.  Move DOWN: Head moves to (4, 1). This is an empty space, a valid move.\n3.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (3, 0). This is a wall '#', resulting in a collision. Invalid move.\n4.  Move RIGHT: This move is invalid because the snake cannot reverse its current direction (LEFT).\n\nWe must choose between UP and DOWN.\n- If we move UP, the head goes to (2, 1). The path towards the apple at (1, 3) opens up.\n- If we move DOWN, the head goes to (4, 1). This path leads towards the two apples at (5, 2) and (5, 3). Let's analyze this path further:\n    - Move 1: DOWN to (4, 1). Direction becomes DOWN.\n    - Move 2: From (4, 1), the only valid move is DOWN to (5, 1) (RIGHT is blocked by body at (4, 2), LEFT is wall). Direction remains DOWN.\n    - Move 3: From (5, 1), possible moves are DOWN (to 6, 1), LEFT (wall), RIGHT (to 5, 2 - Apple!). Moving RIGHT eats the apple at (5, 2).\n    - Move 4: Eat apple at (5, 2). Head at (5, 2). Direction becomes RIGHT. Score increases.\n    - Move 5: From (5, 2), possible moves are UP (to 4, 2), DOWN (to 6, 2), RIGHT (to 5, 3 - Apple!). Moving RIGHT eats the apple at (5, 3).\n\nThe DOWN path allows the snake to eat two apples relatively quickly. The UP path leads towards only one apple. Therefore, moving DOWN seems like the better strategy to maximize the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# SS   #\n# H    #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nMy goal is to eat apples and avoid collisions.\nThe current direction is DOWN. I cannot move UP.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** Head moves to (4, 1). This is an empty square '#' and not the snake body 'S'. This move is safe. The board would become:\n    ```\n    ########\n    #   A  #\n    #      #\n    # S    #\n    #HS    #\n    #  AA  #\n    #      #\n    ########\n    ```\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** Head moves to (4, 3). This is an empty square '#' and not the snake body 'S'. This move is safe. The board would become:\n    ```\n    ########\n    #   A  #\n    #      #\n    # S    #\n    # SH   #\n    #  AA  #\n    #      #\n    ########\n    ```\n3.  **Move DOWN:** Head moves to (5, 2). This is an empty square '#' and not the snake body 'S'. This move is safe. The board would become:\n    ```\n    ########\n    #   A  #\n    #      #\n    # S    #\n    # S    #\n    # HAA  #\n    #      #\n    ########\n    ```\n\nEvaluating the moves:\n*   LEFT moves away from the nearby apples at (5,3) and (5,4).\n*   RIGHT moves the head to (4,3), closer to the apples at (5,3) and (5,4). The next move DOWN would eat the apple at (5,3).\n*   DOWN moves the head to (5,2), directly next to the apple at (5,3). The next move RIGHT would eat the apple at (5,3).\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN position the snake to eat an apple on the next turn. Moving DOWN places the head adjacent to the two apples at (5,3) and (5,4). This seems slightly more advantageous for potentially eating both quickly.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# HAA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 2). The body segments are at (4, 2) and (3, 2). The snake is moving DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN. Moving UP is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (5, 1). This is an empty space. The snake does not eat an apple.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (5, 3). This square contains an apple ('A'). The snake eats the apple, grows in length, and the score increases.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head moves to (6, 2). This is an empty space. The snake does not eat an apple.\n\nTo maximize the score, the snake should eat the apple. Moving RIGHT achieves this immediately.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# SHA  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  The snake's head (H) is at position (5, 2).\n2.  The snake's body (S) occupies positions (5, 1), (4, 1), and (3, 1).\n3.  Apples (A) are at positions (1, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 6).\n4.  The current direction is RIGHT.\n5.  The snake cannot move LEFT because it would be reversing its direction and also colliding with its body at (5, 1).\n6.  Possible moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n    *   Moving UP leads to (4, 2), which is empty.\n    *   Moving DOWN leads to (6, 2), which is empty.\n    *   Moving RIGHT leads to (5, 3), which is empty.\n7.  We need to choose a move that helps reach an apple without collision.\n8.  Let's calculate the Manhattan distance from the head (5, 2) to each apple:\n    *   Apple at (1, 4): |5-1| + |2-4| = 4 + 2 = 6 steps.\n    *   Apple at (5, 5): |5-5| + |2-5| = 0 + 3 = 3 steps.\n    *   Apple at (6, 6): |5-6| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n9.  The closest apple is at (5, 5). Moving RIGHT takes the snake towards this apple.\n10. Let's check the path to (5, 5) by moving RIGHT repeatedly:\n    *   Move RIGHT: Head to (5, 3). Safe.\n    *   Move RIGHT: Head to (5, 4). Safe.\n    *   Move RIGHT: Head to (5, 5). Eats apple. Safe.\n11. Moving RIGHT is a safe move that directly progresses towards the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# SA   #\n# SSH  #\n#     A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 5).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT is forbidden as it's the reverse direction).\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (4, 5). This square contains an apple 'A'. This move is valid, doesn't hit a wall or the snake's body ('S' parts are at (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3)). Eating the apple increases the score and length.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (6, 5). This square is empty. This move is valid.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (5, 6). This square is empty. This move is valid.\n\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is the primary goal. The position after moving UP ((4, 5)) is safe and allows further moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Moving DOWN or RIGHT positions the snake closer to walls and might lead to the apple at (6, 6), but eating the apple at (4, 5) first seems like a better immediate strategy.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SAH  #\n# SSS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 5) (row 4, column 5, using 0-based indexing from the top-left).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n1.  Move UP: The head moves to (3, 5). This square is empty. It's a valid move. This move positions the snake closer to the apple at (1, 4) and keeps it in an open area.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (4, 4). This square is empty. It's a valid move. The next move LEFT would eat the apple at (4, 3). However, after eating, the snake would be at H=(4,3) with body [(4,4), (4,5), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)] and the only possible move would be UP to (3, 3), which might be restrictive.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (4, 6). This square is empty. It's a valid move. This moves away from the nearest apples but towards the apple at (6, 6).\n\nComparing the options, moving UP keeps the snake in a more open space with multiple subsequent options and heads towards the apple at (1, 4). Moving LEFT allows eating an apple quickly but leads to a potentially constrained position. Moving RIGHT moves towards the apple at (6,6) but away from the others. Moving UP seems the safest and most flexible option for now.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#  AS  #\n# SSS  #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake head is at (3, 4). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves:\n1.  **UP**: Move to (2, 4). This square is empty and is a valid move (not reversing direction). This moves the snake closer to the apple at (1, 4).\n2.  **LEFT**: Move to (3, 3). This square is empty and is a valid move.\n3.  **RIGHT**: Move to (3, 5). This square is empty and is a valid move.\n4.  **DOWN**: Move to (4, 4). This square is empty, but it's the reverse of the current direction (UP), so it's an invalid move.\n\nComparing the valid moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT):\n- Moving UP positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (1, 4) in the next move.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT moves away from the nearest apple.\n\nThe safest and most rewarding immediate strategy is to move towards the closest apple. Moving UP achieves this.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n#   H  #\n#   S  #\n#  AS  #\n#  SS  #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 4). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move to (1, 4). This square contains an apple 'A'. Eating the apple increases the score and snake length. This is a valid move.\n2.  LEFT: Move to (2, 3). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n3.  RIGHT: Move to (2, 5). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n4.  DOWN: Cannot move DOWN because the current direction is UP.\n\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which aligns with the goal of the game. Let's check the state after moving UP:\n- The head moves to (1, 4).\n- The snake eats the apple.\n- The snake grows, the old head position (2, 4) becomes part of the body.\n- The tail segment at (5, 3) remains for this step because the snake grew.\n- New snake: H at (1, 4), S at (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3).\n- This move is safe (no collision with walls or self).\n\nMoving LEFT or RIGHT is safe but does not result in eating an apple this turn. Since eating apples is the primary goal, moving UP is the best option.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#   H  #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#A AS  #\n#  SS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 4). The current direction is UP.\nPossible next moves are LEFT or RIGHT. Moving UP would hit the wall, and moving DOWN is not allowed (reversing direction).\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (1, 3). This square is empty. This move is valid. The snake would then be positioned to move towards the apples at (4, 1) and (4, 3).\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (1, 5). This square is empty. This move is valid. The snake would move away from the two closest apples but potentially towards the apple at (6, 6).\n\nConsidering the proximity to apples and avoiding immediate danger:\n- Moving LEFT brings the snake closer to two apples. A possible path after moving LEFT could be DOWN -> DOWN -> DOWN to reach the apple at (4, 3).\n- Moving RIGHT moves the snake away from the closer apples. Subsequent moves might involve navigating around the snake's own body, which could be risky. For example, moving DOWN from (1, 5) would lead to (2, 5), then potentially LEFT to (2, 4), which is a collision with the body 'S'.\n\nMoving LEFT appears to be the safer and more opportunistic move, positioning the snake to potentially eat an apple in the near future without immediate risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  HS  #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#A AS  #\n#   S  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 12\n\nBased on the current board state and the goal of eating apples while avoiding collisions, let's analyze the possible moves:\n1.  **LEFT:** The snake's head would move to (1, 2). This is a safe move into an empty space.\n2.  **UP:** The snake's head would move to (0, 3), which is a wall ('#'). This would result in a game over.\n3.  **DOWN:** The snake's head would move to (2, 3). This is a safe move into an empty space.\n4.  **RIGHT:** This move is invalid because the snake cannot reverse its current direction (LEFT).\n\nComparing the valid moves (LEFT and DOWN):\n- Moving LEFT positions the snake further away from the apples.\n- Moving DOWN positions the snake closer to the apples at (4, 1) and (4, 3). This seems like a better strategic move to pursue the apples.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#  SS  #\n#  HS  #\n#   S  #\n#A AS  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at (3, 2).

This move leads to a collision and game over.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head moves to (4, 2). This square contains an apple 'A'. This move is safe, eats an apple, increases the score, and increases the snake's length.\n\nComparing the valid moves, moving DOWN is the best option as it allows the snake to eat an apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#  SS  #\n#  SS  #\n#  HS  #\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 14\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 3).

Let's check the safety after moving RIGHT.\nIf the snake moves RIGHT to (6, 6), it eats the apple. The new head position is (6, 6). The current head position (6, 5) becomes part of the body. The snake grows, so the tail segment does not disappear immediately. The next required direction will be RIGHT. The only possible moves from (6, 6) with direction RIGHT would be UP (to 5, 6) or DOWN (to 7, 6 - wall). The snake cannot turn LEFT (to 6, 5 - body) as it would be reversing direction relative to the *next* step. Since DOWN hits a wall, the only valid subsequent move is UP to (5, 6). Position (5, 6) is empty. Therefore, moving RIGHT is safe and beneficial.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#SSS A #\n#SS    #\n# SSSHA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (6, 6).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves:\n1.

LEFT: This move is invalid because it reverses the current direction (RIGHT).\n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple at (6,7) immediately. This is the optimal move to increase the score and length.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#SSS A #\n#SS    #\n# SSSSH#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 24\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6, 6).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT because there is a wall '#' at (6, 7).\nThe snake cannot move DOWN because there is a wall '#' at (7, 6).\nThe snake cannot move LEFT because it is the opposite of the current direction (RIGHT).\nThe snake can move UP to position (5, 6), which is an empty space ' '. This move is valid and avoids collision.\n\nTherefore, the only valid move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#SS  A #\n#SS   H#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1.  **UP**: The snake's head is at (5, 6). Moving UP would move the head to (4, 6). This square is empty (' '). This move is valid as it's not a wall, not the snake's body, and not reversing the direction (current direction is UP, not DOWN).\n2.  **DOWN**: This move is invalid because the snake cannot reverse its direction (current direction is UP).\n3.  **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would move the head to (5, 5). This square is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would move the head to (5, 7). This square is a wall ('#'). This move is invalid due to collision.\n\nWe have two valid moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nLet's evaluate the valid moves:\n-   **Move UP**: The head moves to (4, 6). This places the head adjacent to the apple at (4, 5). The next move could be LEFT to eat this apple.\n-   **Move LEFT**: The head moves to (5, 5). This position is also safe. The next move could be UP to reach the apple at (4, 5).\n\nBoth moves lead towards the nearest apple at (4, 5) within two steps. Moving UP positions the head at (4, 6), which is on the same row as the apple, making the subsequent move LEFT straightforward. Moving UP also shifts the snake's head closer to the other apples located in row 3. Therefore, moving UP seems like a good strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#S   AH#\n#SS   S#\n# SSSSS#\n########\nCurrent direction: UP\nThe snake's head is at (4, 6). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n1.  Move UP: Head moves to (3, 6). This is an empty space, a safe move.\n2.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (4, 5). This space contains an apple ('A'). This is a safe move and eats an apple.\n3.  Move RIGHT: Head moves to (4, 7). This space is a wall ('#'). This move leads to game over.\n4.  Move DOWN: Not allowed as it's the reverse of the current direction (UP).\n\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple and increase the score. Moving UP is safe but doesn't yield an immediate score increase. Moving RIGHT leads to a loss. Therefore, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n# A A  #\n#S   HS#\n#SS   S#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 27\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  The snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 5).\n2.  The current direction is LEFT.\n3.  Possible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN. We cannot move RIGHT because it's the reverse of LEFT.\n4.  Check potential collisions:\n    *   Move LEFT: Target position (4, 4). This square is empty. Valid.\n    *   Move UP: Target position (3, 5). This square is empty. Valid.\n    *   Move DOWN: Target position (5, 5). This square contains 'S' (snake body). Invalid (collision).\n5.  Available moves are LEFT and UP.\n6.  Apples are located at (2, 6), (3, 2), and (3, 4).\n7.  Moving LEFT to (4, 4) moves towards the apples at (3, 2) and (3, 4). The next move could be UP to (3, 4) to eat an apple.\n8.  Moving UP to (3, 5) moves towards the apples at (2, 6) and (3, 4). The next move could be LEFT to (3, 4) to eat an apple.\n9.  Both moves are safe and lead towards an apple in the subsequent step. Moving UP positions the snake slightly better for the apple at (2, 6) after eating the one at (3, 4).\n\nDecision: Choose UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n# A AH #\n#    SS#\n#SS   S#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nValid moves:\n1.  UP: Move head to (2, 5). This square is empty. Valid.\n2.  LEFT: Move head to (3, 4). This square is empty. Valid.\n3.  RIGHT: Move head to (3, 6). This square contains 'S'. Invalid (collision).\n4.  DOWN: Cannot reverse direction from UP. Invalid.\n\nComparing valid moves UP and LEFT:\n- If I move UP, the head will be at (2, 5). From there, I can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would lead to the apple at (2, 6) in the next step.\n- If I move LEFT, the head will be at (3, 4). From there, I can move UP, LEFT, or DOWN. Moving LEFT would lead to the apple at (3, 3) in the next step.\n\nBoth moves allow reaching an apple in the subsequent turn. Let's consider the position after eating the apple:\n- Eating apple at (2, 6) (after UP, then RIGHT): Head at (2, 6), moving RIGHT. The only escape route is UP (to 1, 6), as RIGHT hits a wall and DOWN hits the snake's body. This seems restrictive.\n- Eating apple at (3, 3) (after LEFT, then LEFT): Head at (3, 3), moving LEFT. Possible next moves are UP (2, 3), LEFT (3, 2), or DOWN (4, 3), all of which are currently empty. This offers more immediate options and also positions the snake closer to the apple at (3, 1).\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is the better strategic choice as it leads to an apple quickly while maintaining more movement options afterward.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n#     A#\n#     A#\n# A HS #\n#    SS#\n#SS   S#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT (cannot move RIGHT).\n\n1.  **Move UP**: The head moves to (2, 4). This square is empty, so it's a valid move. This moves away from the closest apple at (3, 1) but into more open space towards the apples at (1, 6) and (2, 6).\n2.  **Move DOWN**: The head moves to (4, 4). This square is empty, so it's a valid move. This moves away from all apples and closer to the snake's tail, potentially restricting future movement.\n3.  **Move LEFT**: The head moves to (3, 3). This square is empty, so it's a valid move. This moves the snake towards the apple at (3, 1).\n\nComparing the options:\n- Moving LEFT is the most direct path towards the nearest apple at (3, 1). The path (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 1) seems clear for the next few steps.\n- Moving UP moves into open space but requires more steps to reach any apple.\n- Moving DOWN moves into a potentially more constrained area near the tail.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is the most promising move to efficiently collect the nearest apple while maintaining safety.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#     A#\n#     A#\n# AHSS #\n#    SS#\n# S   S#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 30\n\nMy goal is to eat apples and avoid collisions with walls or the snake's own body.\nThe current direction is LEFT.

This square is empty. This is a safe move.\n3.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (3, 1). This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score and the snake's length. This is a safe move.\n\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. After eating the apple at (3, 1), the snake's head will be at (3, 1). The next possible moves will be UP (to 2, 1, which is empty) or DOWN (to 4, 1, which is empty), as moving LEFT would hit the wall and moving RIGHT is forbidden. Since eating the apple is beneficial and does not lead to immediate danger, LEFT is the best move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#     A#\n#     A#\n# HSSSA#\n#    SS#\n# S   S#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 1) (row 3, column 1, 0-indexed inside the walls).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nMoving LEFT would hit the wall at (3, 0), which ends the game.\nMoving RIGHT is not allowed because it's the reverse of the current direction LEFT.\nMoving UP leads the head to (2, 1), which is an empty space. This move is safe.\nMoving DOWN leads the head to (4, 1), which is an empty space. This move is safe.\n\nBoth UP and DOWN are valid and safe immediate moves. Moving UP seems strategically better as it moves towards a more open area and potentially towards the apples on the right side. Moving DOWN pushes the snake further into the bottom-left corner where it might get trapped by its own body. Therefore, UP is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n```\n########\n#     A#\n# H   A#\n# SSSSA#\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 32\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 2).

The current direction is UP. The snake cannot move DOWN. The available moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (3, 3). This is an empty square and a safe move. It positions the snake closer to the apple at (2, 4).\n2.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (4, 2). This is an empty square and a safe move. It positions the snake closer to the apple at (5, 1).\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (4, 4). This is an empty square and a safe move. It positions the snake closer to the apple at (4, 5).\n\nTo maximize the score, the snake should try to eat the nearest apple.\n*   Apple at (2, 4): Requires UP, then RIGHT (2 moves).\n*   Apple at (4, 5): Requires RIGHT, then RIGHT (2 moves).\n*   Apple at (5, 1): Requires LEFT, then DOWN, then LEFT (3 moves).\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT lead to an apple in 2 total moves. Moving RIGHT positions the snake at (4, 4), directly adjacent to the apple at (4, 5). The next move (RIGHT) would eat the apple. This seems like a good strategy.\n\nTherefore, I choose RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#  SH  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 4) and its body is at (4, 3). Its current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot move LEFT. The available moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Check move UP:** The head would move to (3, 4). This position is empty. This move is valid. It positions the snake closer to the apple at (2, 4).\n2.  **Check move DOWN:** The head would move to (5, 4). This position is empty. This move is valid. It positions the snake closer to the apple at (5, 1), but requires turning LEFT later.\n3.  **Check move RIGHT:** The head would move to (4, 5). This position is empty. This move is valid. It moves the snake further into empty space, away from the closest apples.\n\nComparing the options, moving UP takes the snake to (3, 4). From there, moving UP again would lead to eating the apple at (2, 4). This seems like the most efficient way to eat an apple quickly.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A  H  #\n#   S  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\nThe current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving DOWN is invalid as it's the reverse direction.\n1. Move UP: The head moves to (2, 4), which contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move, eats an apple, increases the score, and grows the snake. The new state would have H at (2, 4), S at (3, 4), and S at (4, 4).\n2. Move LEFT: The head moves to (3, 3), which is empty ' '. This is a valid move. The snake becomes H at (3, 3), S at (3, 4). No apple is eaten.\n3. Move RIGHT: The head moves to (3, 5), which is empty ' '. This is a valid move. The snake becomes H at (3, 5), S at (3, 4). No apple is eaten.\n\nMoving UP directly eats an apple, which is the primary goal. It is a safe move as the new head position (2, 4) is not a wall or part of the snake's body. Therefore, UP is the best move.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#      #\n# A H  #\n#A  S  #\n#   S  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake head is at (2, 4) (row 2, column 4), and the body segments are at (3, 4) and (4, 4). The current direction is UP. Apples are at (2, 2), (3, 1), and (5, 1).\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **UP:** Move to (1, 4). This is an empty space. Valid.\n2.  **LEFT:** Move to (2, 3). This is an empty space. Valid.\n3.  **RIGHT:** Move to (2, 5). This is an empty space. Valid.\n\nI need to choose a move that allows the snake to survive and eat apples. The nearest apple is at (2, 2).\n- Moving UP to (1, 4) increases the distance to the apple at (2, 2).\n- Moving LEFT to (2, 3) moves the head adjacent to the row of the nearest apple (2, 2) and closer to the apple cluster at (2,2) and (3,1).\n- Moving RIGHT to (2, 5) moves away from all apples.\n\nMoving LEFT seems like the most promising first step towards the apples. Let's trace the path starting with LEFT:\n1.  Move LEFT: H(2, 3). Dir LEFT.\n2.  Move UP: H(1, 3). Dir UP. (Cannot go RIGHT - reverse)\n3.  Move LEFT: H(1, 2). Dir LEFT. (Cannot go DOWN - reverse)\n4.  Move DOWN: H(2, 2). Eat Apple A(2,2). Dir DOWN. (Cannot go RIGHT - reverse)\n\nThis path reaches the first apple in 4 moves and seems safe.\nTherefore, the best move now is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n# AHS  #\n#A  S  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake is currently at H(2, 3), S(2, 4), S(3, 4) (using 0-based indexing for the inner 6x6 grid).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:**\n    *   New head position: (2, 2). This is an empty space.\n    *   This move is safe and moves the head closer to the apple at (2, 1).\n\n2.  **Move UP:**\n    *   New head position: (1, 3). This is an empty space.\n    *   This move is safe but moves away from the closest apples.\n\n3.  **Move DOWN:**\n    *   New head position: (3, 3). This is an empty space.\n    *   This move is safe and moves towards the apple at (3, 0).\n\nComparing the options:\n- Moving LEFT positions the snake to eat the apple at (2, 1) in the next turn by moving LEFT again.\n- Moving DOWN positions the snake towards the apple at (3, 0), which would require a LEFT turn next.\n- Moving UP moves away from all apples.\n\nMoving LEFT seems the most advantageous move as it allows for capturing the nearest apple in the subsequent step.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n# HSS  #\n#A  S  #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  The snake's head is at (2, 2). The body segments are at (2, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 4).\n2.  The current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot turn RIGHT.\n3.  Possible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n4.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (2, 1). This is a safe empty square. It positions the snake to move DOWN towards the apple at (3, 1).\n5.  Move UP: Head moves to (1, 2). This is a safe empty square. It moves the snake away from the closest apples.\n6.  Move DOWN: Head moves to (3, 2). This is a safe empty square. It positions the snake adjacent to the apple at (3, 1), allowing it to be eaten on the next turn by moving LEFT.\n7.  Apples are located at (3, 1), (4, 4), and (5, 1). Moving DOWN sets up a clear path to eat the apple at (3, 1) on the next move. Following that, the apple at (5, 1) is also accessible.\n\nConclusion: Moving DOWN is a good strategic move as it immediately positions the snake to eat an apple in the subsequent turn and provides a path towards another apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n#AH    #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 2). The snake is currently moving DOWN.\nThe possible next moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving UP is not allowed as it's the reverse of the current direction.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (3, 1). This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score and snake length. This is a valid move as (3, 1) is not a wall or part of the snake's body.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (3, 3). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head moves to (4, 2). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is the primary objective. This move is safe and leads to further valid moves in the next step.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n#HS    #\n#A  A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n#SS  A #\n#H  A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 1) (row 4, column 1, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible next moves:\n1.  Continue DOWN: The snake head would move to (5, 1). This square contains an apple 'A'. This move is valid (not a wall or self) and beneficial (eats an apple).\n2.  Turn LEFT: The snake head would move to (4, 0). This square contains a part of the snake's body 'S'. This move is invalid (collision with self).\n3.  Turn RIGHT: The snake head would move to (4, 2). This square is empty ' '. This move is valid.\n4.  Turn UP: This move is invalid because the current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse direction.\n\nMoving DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple safely. Moving RIGHT is also safe but doesn't result in eating an apple immediately. Therefore, moving DOWN is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n#SS  A #\n#S  A  #\n#H A   #\n#      #\n########\n```\nYou are at (5, 1) and currently moving DOWN.\nThe possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN. You cannot move UP because it's the reverse direction.\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 0) would collide with the snake's body ('S').\n- Moving DOWN to (6, 1) is a valid move into an empty space.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 2) is a valid move and will eat an apple ('A').\n\nEating the apple immediately increases the score and length, which is generally desirable. Moving RIGHT achieves this. Moving DOWN is safe but delays eating an apple. Therefore, moving RIGHT is the better option.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n# SS   #\n#SS  A #\n#S  A  #\n#SHA   #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5, 2). The current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT (cannot move LEFT as it's the reverse direction).\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (4, 2). This square is empty and not a wall or body part. This move is safe.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (6, 2). This square is empty and not a wall or body part. This move is safe.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (5, 3). This square is empty and not a wall or body part. This move is safe.\n\nNow, let's consider the apples at (3, 5), (4, 4), and (5, 4).\nThe head is at (5, 2).\n- The apple at (5, 4) is 2 steps away (RIGHT, RIGHT).\n- The apple at (4, 4) is 3 steps away (e.g., UP, RIGHT, RIGHT).\n- The apple at (3, 5) is 5 steps away (e.g., UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP).\n\nMoving RIGHT takes the snake towards the closest apple at (5, 4). This seems like a good strategy. Moving RIGHT to (5, 3) is safe and allows the snake to potentially eat the apple at (5, 4) in the next step by moving RIGHT again.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#      #\n# SS   #\n#SS  A #\n#S  A A#\n#SSH   #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 12\n\nAnalysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 4) (row 5, column 4, 0-indexed from top-left inside walls).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot move LEFT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move to (4, 4). This square is empty (' '). It is a valid move. This positions the snake closer to the apples at (4, 3) and (4, 5).\n2.  DOWN: Move to (6, 4). This square is empty (' '). It is a valid move. This moves the snake away from the apples.\n3.  RIGHT: Move to (5, 5). This square is empty (' '). It is a valid move. This positions the snake closer to the apple at (4, 5).\n\nComparing UP and RIGHT:\n- Moving UP to (4, 4): The next move could be LEFT to eat the apple at (4, 3) or RIGHT to eat the apple at (4, 5).\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 5): The next move could be UP to eat the apple at (4, 5).\n\nMoving UP offers immediate access to two different apples in the subsequent step, making it slightly more advantageous for future positioning. Moving DOWN is suboptimal as it moves away from all apples. Therefore, UP is the best move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# S    #\n#SS  A #\n#S HA A#\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 13\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 3). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move to (3, 3). This cell is empty (' '). Valid.\n2.  LEFT: Move to (4, 2). This cell contains snake body ('S'). Invalid (collision).\n3.  RIGHT: Move to (4, 4). This cell is empty (' '). Valid.\n4.  DOWN: Cannot move DOWN as the current direction is UP (reversing direction is not allowed).\n\nWe have two valid moves: UP and RIGHT.\nLet's analyze them:\n- Moving UP to (3, 3): The snake head will be closer to the apple at (3, 5). A sequence of UP -> RIGHT -> RIGHT would eat the apple at (3, 5). The space around (3, 3) is relatively open towards the top and right.\n- Moving RIGHT to (4, 4): The snake head will be closer to the apple at (4, 6). A sequence of RIGHT -> RIGHT -> RIGHT would eat the apple at (4, 6). The space around (4, 4) is relatively open towards the top, right, and bottom.\n\nBoth moves seem safe and allow paths to the apples. Moving UP positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (3, 5) in two more steps. Moving RIGHT positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (4, 6) in two more steps or the apple at (3, 5) in two steps (RIGHT -> UP -> RIGHT).\nLet's choose UP, as it moves towards the slightly closer apple cluster and opens up the upper part of the board.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#SSH A #\n#S SA A#\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 14\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake head 'H' is at coordinates (3, 3) (0-indexed from top-left, inside the walls). The current direction is UP. The snake body 'S' occupies several squares. Apples 'A' are at (3, 5), (4, 3), and (4, 5).\n\nPossible moves from (3, 3) with direction UP:\n1.  UP: Move to (2, 3). This square is empty. Valid.\n2.  LEFT: Move to (3, 2). This square is occupied by 'S'. Collision. Invalid.\n3.  RIGHT: Move to (3, 4). This square is empty. Valid.\n4.  DOWN: Cannot move DOWN as the current direction is UP (cannot reverse).\n\nEvaluating valid moves:\n-   Move UP: Head moves to (2, 3). This is a safe move, but doesn't immediately lead to an apple. The closest apple from (2, 3) would require several more moves (e.g., RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN to reach (3, 5)).\n-   Move RIGHT: Head moves to (3, 4). This is a safe move. From this position, the snake can move RIGHT again on the next turn to eat the apple at (3, 5). This path reaches an apple faster than moving UP.\n\nStrategy: Prioritize getting closer to an apple safely. Moving RIGHT positions the snake to eat the apple at (3, 5) in the next step.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#S SHA #\n#S SA A#\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 15\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\nThe snake's head is at (3, 5).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves are RIGHT, UP, DOWN. LEFT is not allowed (reversing direction).\n- Moving RIGHT: The head moves to (3, 6). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move, eats an apple, and increases the score.\n- Moving UP: The head moves to (2, 5). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n- Moving DOWN: The head moves to (4, 5). This square contains a part of the snake's body ('S'). This is an invalid move (collision).\n\nTo maximize the score, the snake should eat the apple. Moving RIGHT achieves this and is a safe move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#SASSH #\n#S SA A#\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nAnalysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 6). The current direction is RIGHT.\nThe possible next moves are:\n1.  Continue RIGHT: The snake would move to (3, 7), which is a wall '#'. This results in a collision and game over.\n2.  Turn UP: The snake would move to (2, 6), which is an empty space ' '. This move is safe.\n3.  Turn DOWN: The snake would move to (4, 6), which contains an apple 'A'. This move is safe, and the snake will eat the apple, increase its score, and grow longer.\n\nTurning LEFT is not allowed because the snake is currently moving RIGHT.\n\nComparing UP and DOWN: Moving DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is the primary goal of the game. Let's check the safety after eating the apple. If the snake moves DOWN, the new head position will be (4, 6), and the direction will be DOWN. The snake will grow, incorporating the previous head position (3, 6) into its body. From (4, 6), the snake can safely move LEFT to (4, 5) or DOWN to (5, 6) in the subsequent step. Therefore, moving DOWN is not only safe but also scores a point and seems strategically sound.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# ASSS #\n#S SAHA#\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 17\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 6).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible next moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving UP is not allowed as it reverses the current direction.\n1.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (4, 5). This cell contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move, eats an apple, increases the score, and grows the snake.\n2.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (4, 7). This cell contains a wall '#'. This is an invalid move and would end the game.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (5, 6). This cell is empty ' '. This is a valid and safe move, but does not eat an apple immediately.\n\nComparing the valid moves: Moving LEFT eats an apple immediately, which is the goal. Moving DOWN is safe but doesn't score. Therefore, moving LEFT is the better option.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# ASSS #\n#S SHSA#\n#SSSA  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 18\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n5.  Check move UP: The cell at (3, 4) contains 'S' (snake body). Moving UP results in a collision. Invalid move.\n6.  Check move LEFT: The cell at (4, 3) is empty (' '). Moving LEFT is possible.\n7.  Check move DOWN: The cell at (5, 4) contains 'A' (apple). Moving DOWN is possible and eats an apple.\n\nCompare valid moves (LEFT vs DOWN):\n-   Move LEFT: Head moves to (4, 3). Direction becomes LEFT. Next possible moves from (4, 3): LEFT to (4, 2) is 'S' (collision), UP to (3, 3) is 'S' (collision), DOWN to (5, 3) is 'S' (collision). Moving LEFT leads to an immediate dead end.\n-   Move DOWN: Head moves to (5, 4). Eats an apple. Direction becomes DOWN. Next possible moves from (5, 4): LEFT to (5, 3) is 'S' (collision), RIGHT to (5, 5) is ' ' (safe), DOWN to (6, 4) is ' ' (safe). Moving DOWN eats an apple and leaves safe options for the next turn.\n\nConclusion: Moving DOWN is the best move as it avoids collision, eats an apple, and maintains future maneuverability.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# ASSS #\n#S SSSA#\n#SSSH  #\n#  A   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 19\n\nMy analysis:\n1.  The snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 5) (row 5, column 5, 0-indexed from top-left).\n2.  The current direction is DOWN.\n3.  The snake cannot move UP, as it's the reverse direction.\n4.  Moving LEFT: The square at (5, 4) contains 'S' (part of the snake's body). This would cause a collision. Invalid move.\n5.  Moving RIGHT: The square at (5, 6) is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n6.  Moving DOWN: The square at (6, 5) is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nNow I need to evaluate the consequences of the valid moves (RIGHT and DOWN):\n\n*   **If I move RIGHT:**\n    *   The head moves to (5, 6). The new direction is RIGHT.\n    *   From (5, 6), the possible next moves are UP to (4, 6) (contains 'A') or DOWN to (6, 6) (empty). LEFT is reverse, RIGHT hits a wall '#'.\n    *   If I then move UP to eat the apple at (4, 6): The head will be at (4, 6), direction UP. The snake grows. Possible next moves are LEFT to (4, 5) ('S', collision) or RIGHT to (4, 7) ('#', collision). This is a dead end.\n    *   If I then move DOWN to (6, 6): The head will be at (6, 6), direction DOWN. Possible next moves are LEFT to (6, 5) ('S', collision) or RIGHT to (6, 7) ('#', collision). This is also a dead end.\n    *   Conclusion: Moving RIGHT leads to a situation where the snake is trapped within the next two moves.\n\n*   **If I move DOWN:**\n    *   The head moves to (6, 5). The new direction is DOWN.\n    *   From (6, 5), the possible next moves are LEFT to (6, 4) (empty) or RIGHT to (6, 6) (empty). UP is reverse, DOWN hits a wall '#'.\n    *   If I then move RIGHT to (6, 6): The head is at (6, 6), direction RIGHT. The only possible move is UP to (5, 6).\n    *   If I then move UP to (5, 6): The head is at (5, 6), direction UP. The only possible move is UP to (4, 6) (eat apple 'A').\n    *   If I then move UP to eat the apple at (4, 6): Head at (4, 6), direction UP. Snake grows. Possible next moves LEFT (4, 5) = 'S' (collision), RIGHT (4, 7) = '#' (collision). This path also leads to a dead end.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate the path starting DOWN -> LEFT. From (6, 5), move LEFT to (6, 4). Head is at (6, 4), direction LEFT. Possible next moves are LEFT to (6, 3) (empty) or DOWN to (7, 4) (empty). UP is ('S', collision), RIGHT is reverse.\n    *   Moving DOWN -> LEFT -> LEFT leads to (6, 3). From there, LEFT eats the apple at (6, 2). DOWN goes to (7, 3). This path offers survival options and the chance to eat an apple without immediate self-collision.\n    *   Moving DOWN -> LEFT -> DOWN leads to (7, 4). From there, LEFT (7, 3) and RIGHT (7, 5) are possible. This path also seems safe for now.\n\nComparing the initial moves: Moving RIGHT leads to a guaranteed trap. Moving DOWN allows for subsequent moves (like LEFT) that offer potential escape routes and access to apples. Therefore, DOWN is the better move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# ASSS #\n#  SSSA#\n#SSSS  #\n#  AH  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 20\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6, 4) (row 6, column 4).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP, as that would be reversing direction.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (6, 3). This square contains 'S' (snake body). This move leads to a collision with itself. Invalid move.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (6, 5). This square is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (7, 4). This square contains '#' (wall). This move leads to a collision with the wall.

This is a valid move.\n3.  Turn DOWN: Move to (7, 5). This square is a wall '#'. This leads to collision (Game Over).\n4.  Turn LEFT: Move to (6, 4). This would reverse the snake's direction (RIGHT to LEFT), which is not allowed.\n\nThe valid moves are RIGHT and UP.\n\nLet's analyze the consequences:\n*   If move RIGHT to (6, 6): The only next possible move is UP to (5, 6). From (5, 6), moving UP leads to the apple at (4, 6), but this is a trap as the snake will be blocked by its own body and the wall immediately after eating. The only other move from (5, 6) is LEFT to (5, 5). Following this path leads to a sequence of forced moves into a dead end: (6,6) -> (5,6) -> (5,5) -> (5,4) -> (6,4) -> Collision. This path allows for 5 more moves.\n*   If move UP to (5, 5): The next possible moves are LEFT to (5, 4) or RIGHT to (5, 6).\n    *   Going LEFT to (5, 4) leads to a forced move DOWN to (6, 4), which is a dead end (collision). This path allows for 2 more moves.\n    *   Going RIGHT to (5, 6) leads to a forced move DOWN to (6, 6), which is a dead end (collision). This path also allows for 2 more moves.\n\nBoth possible initial moves (RIGHT and UP) lead to an unavoidable game over situation. However, moving RIGHT allows the snake to survive for 5 more steps, while moving UP leads to game over in 3 steps. As a good game player, surviving longer is preferable. Therefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# ASSS #\n#  SSSA#\n#  SS  #\n#  ASSH#\n########\n```\nCurrent state analysis:\n1.  **Board:** 8x8 grid with walls '#'.\n2.  **Snake Head (H):** Located at position (5, 5) (row 5, column 5, 0-indexed from top-left).\n3.  **Snake Body (S):** Occupies positions (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4).\n4.  **Apples (A):** Located at positions (2, 2), (3, 5), (5, 2).\n5.  **Current Direction:** RIGHT.\n6.  **Snake Length:** 1 (Head) + 10 (Body) = 11.\n7.  **Forbidden Move:** Since the current direction is RIGHT, the snake cannot move LEFT (reverse direction).\n8.  **Epoch:** 22 (Game ends at epoch 100).\n\nAvailable moves and consequences:\n1.  **UP:** Move head to (4, 5). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  **DOWN:** Move head to (6, 5). This square is a wall ('#'). This move leads to collision and game over.\n3.  **LEFT:** This move is forbidden as it's the reverse of the current direction (RIGHT). Even if allowed, it would move to (5, 4), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'), leading to collision.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Move head to (5, 6). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nComparing valid moves (UP and RIGHT):\n*   **Move UP:** Moves the head to (4, 5). This position is safe. The nearest apple is at (3, 5), which is just one step UP and one step RIGHT from the current head position (5, 5). Moving UP brings the head to (4, 5), directly below the apple at (3, 5), making it reachable in the next step by moving UP again.\n*   **Move RIGHT:** Moves the head to (5, 6). This position is safe but moves away from all apples. The nearest apple at (3, 5) would be further away.\n\nStrategy consideration: The primary goal is to eat apples. Moving UP positions the snake to eat the nearest apple (3, 5) in the subsequent move. Moving RIGHT moves away from the apples. Therefore, moving UP is the strategically better choice.\n\nLet's confirm the safety of the UP move:\n- Current Head: (5, 5)\n- Move UP: New Head at (4, 5).\n- The tail position (based on tracing the snake backward: H(5,5) <- S(5,4) <- S(5,3) <- S(4,3) <- S(4,2) <- S(3,2) <- S(3,3) <- S(3,4) <- S(2,4) <- S(2,5) <- S(2,3)) is (2, 3). When the head moves to (4, 5), the tail at (2, 3) will disappear. The old head position (5, 5) becomes part of the body. The new position (4, 5) is not occupied by the snake's body or a wall.

Snake grows. New body segment appears at (2, 1).\n    - After eating, head is at (3, 1), moving DOWN. The square above it (2, 1) is now occupied by the snake's body. Possible next moves are LEFT (to 3,0) or DOWN (to 4,1). Moving UP (to 2,1) would cause a collision.\n\n- **Path 2: DOWN then LEFT**\n    - Move DOWN: Head at (3, 2). Body segment now at (2, 2).\n    - Move LEFT: Head at (3, 1) (eats apple). Snake grows. New body segment appears at (3, 2).\n    - After eating, head is at (3, 1), moving LEFT. The squares around it are: UP (2,1) - empty, DOWN (4,1) - empty, LEFT (3,0) - empty. All three directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT) are possible next moves (cannot move RIGHT as it was the previous direction before turning LEFT).\n\nPath 2 (DOWN first, then LEFT) leaves more movement options open immediately after eating the apple compared to Path 1 (LEFT first, then DOWN), which blocks the UP direction. Therefore, moving DOWN is strategically slightly better.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n# ASSSS#\n#  S  S#\n# AH  S#\n#     S#\n#   S S#\n#  ASSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 32\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 3).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP.\nPossible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n1.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (3, 2). This is an empty space ' '. This move is safe and positions the snake to eat the apple at (3, 1) on the next turn.\n2.  Move RIGHT: Head moves to (3, 4). This is an empty space ' '. This move is safe but moves away from the closest apples.\n3.  Move DOWN: Head moves to (4, 3). This is an empty space ' '. This move is safe and moves towards the apple at (6, 2), but also towards a denser area of the snake's body.\n\nMoving LEFT is the best option as it moves towards the nearest apple at (3, 1) and maintains space for maneuvering.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n# ASSSS#\n# AS  S#\n# HS  S#\n#     S#\n#   S S#\n#  ASSS#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 33\n\n1.  **Analyze the current state:**\n    *   The snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 1).\n    *   The current direction is LEFT.\n    *   Apples 'A' are at (1, 1), (2, 1), and (6, 2).\n    *   Walls '#' surround the board.\n    *   The snake's body 'S' occupies several squares.\n\n2.  **Evaluate possible moves:**\n    *   **LEFT:** Move to (3, 0). This is a wall '#'. Collision -> Game Over. Invalid move.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Move to (3, 2). This is the opposite of the current direction (LEFT). Invalid move.\n    *   **UP:** Move to (2, 1). This square contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move. Eating the apple increases length and score.\n    *   **DOWN:** Move to (4, 1). This is an empty square. This is a valid move.\n\n3.  **Compare valid moves:**\n    *   **Move UP:** Eats an apple at (2, 1). The head becomes (2, 1), and the direction becomes UP. From (2, 1), the only valid move is UP again to (1, 1) to eat another apple. From (1, 1), the possible moves are LEFT (wall), RIGHT (body 'S'), UP (wall), DOWN (body 'S'). This leads to an immediate trap after eating the second apple. So, moving UP is dangerous.\n    *   **Move DOWN:** Moves to an empty square (4, 1). The head becomes (4, 1), and the direction becomes DOWN. From (4, 1), the snake can continue moving DOWN or turn RIGHT into empty space. This path appears safer and allows maneuvering towards the apple at (6, 2) later.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Moving DOWN is the safer option that avoids immediate traps and keeps possibilities open for reaching the remaining apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n# ASSSS#\n# AS  S#\n# SS  S#\n# H   S#\n#     S#\n#  ASSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 34\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 1).\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies several squares.\nApples 'A' are at positions (1, 1), (2, 1), and (6, 2).\nThe walls '#' surround the board.\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN.\n\nPossible next moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN. The snake cannot move UP as it is the reverse of the current direction DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT**: The head would move to (4, 0). This position contains a wall '#'. This move results in a collision and ends the game. Invalid move.\n2.  **Move RIGHT**: The head would move to (4, 2). This position is empty ' '. This move is valid.\n3.  **Move DOWN**: The head would move to (5, 1). This position is empty ' '. This move is valid.\n\nNow we compare the valid moves: RIGHT and DOWN.\n- Moving RIGHT to (4, 2): The head is further from the closest apple at (6, 2) (Manhattan distance 2). The space to maneuver seems okay initially.\n- Moving DOWN to (5, 1): The head is closer to the apple at (6, 2) (Manhattan distance 2). From (5,1), the snake can move DOWN to (6,1) and then RIGHT to (6,2) to eat the apple.\n\nLet's analyze the path towards the nearest apple (6,2) for both options:\n- Path via DOWN: (4,1) -> DOWN -> (5,1) -> DOWN -> (6,1) -> RIGHT -> (6,2) [Eat Apple]. This path is clear of immediate collisions. After eating the apple at (6,2) with direction RIGHT, the possible next move is UP to (5,2), which seems safe.\n- Path via RIGHT: (4,1) -> RIGHT -> (4,2) -> DOWN -> (5,2) -> DOWN -> (6,2) [Eat Apple]. This path is also clear. After eating the apple at (6,2) with direction DOWN, the only possible next move is LEFT to (6,1). From (6,1), the only move is UP to (5,1). From (5,1) with direction UP, all moves (LEFT wall, UP into body at (4,1), RIGHT into body at (5,2)) lead to collision or wall. This path leads to a trap immediately after eating the apple.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is the safer and better strategic choice as it allows access to the nearest apple without leading into an immediate trap.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n# ASSSS#\n# AS  S#\n# SS  S#\n# S   S#\n# H   S#\n#  A SS#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 35\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 1).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves:\n1.

Also, the snake cannot reverse direction from DOWN to UP.\n4.  DOWN: Move to (6, 1). This is an empty space ' '. Valid.\n\nWe need to choose between RIGHT and DOWN.\n\nIf we move RIGHT:\n- The head moves to (5, 2).\n- The next possible moves are LEFT (5, 1 - collision with new body), RIGHT (5, 3 - empty), DOWN (6, 2 - Apple 'A').\n- Moving DOWN next allows eating the apple at (6, 2).\n\nIf we move DOWN:\n- The head moves to (6, 1).\n- The next possible moves are LEFT (6, 0 - wall collision), RIGHT (6, 2 - Apple 'A'), DOWN (7, 1 - wall collision).\n- Moving RIGHT next allows eating the apple at (6, 2).\n\nBoth moves allow the snake to reach the apple at (6, 2) in the subsequent step. Let's consider the position after eating the apple.\n\nPath 1 (RIGHT then DOWN):\n- Move RIGHT to (5, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (6, 2) (eat apple). Head is at (6, 2), direction is DOWN. Body segment added at (5, 2). Possible next moves: LEFT (6, 1 - empty), RIGHT (6, 3 - empty). Cannot move DOWN (wall).\n\nPath 2 (DOWN then RIGHT):\n- Move DOWN to (6, 1).\n- Move RIGHT to (6, 2) (eat apple). Head is at (6, 2), direction is RIGHT. Body segment added at (6, 1). Possible next moves: UP (5, 2 - empty), RIGHT (6, 3 - empty). Cannot move DOWN (wall).\n\nPath 2 offers an immediate upward move into the center after eating the apple, which might provide more flexibility. Path 1 keeps the snake closer to the bottom edge for an extra step. Therefore, moving DOWN first seems slightly preferable.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n# ASSSS#\n# AS  S#\n# SS  S#\n# S   S#\n# S   S#\n# HA  S#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 36\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6, 1).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP because it's the reverse direction.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN because it would hit the wall at (7, 1).\nThe snake cannot move LEFT because it would hit the wall at (6, 0).\nThe snake can move RIGHT to position (6, 2).

DOWN: Cannot move DOWN because the current direction is UP (reversing direction is not allowed).\n\nAnalyzing valid moves:\n-   UP: Moves the head to (4, 3). This keeps the snake in the open central area, providing more maneuvering space. From (4, 3), the snake can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT in the next step.\n-   RIGHT: Moves the head to (5, 4). This positions the snake next to the apple at (6, 4). The next move could be DOWN to eat the apple. Let's check if this leads to a trap.\n    - If move RIGHT to (5, 4).\n    - Next move DOWN to (6, 4) (eat apple). Head is at (6, 4). Snake grows.

This path leads to an unavoidable collision.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to chase the apple at (6,4) leads to a trap. Moving UP is the safer option, allowing the snake to survive and potentially target other apples later.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n# ASSSS#\n# AS  S#\n# SS  S#\n# SH  S#\n# SS   #\n# SSA  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 39\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 4).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head moves to (3, 4). This cell is empty (' '). This is a valid move. This move leads towards the upper part of the board where the snake body is dense and space is limited. It also moves away from the nearest apple at (6,4).\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (4, 3). This cell is empty (' '). This is a valid move. This move keeps the snake in the middle rows and opens a potential path towards the apple at (6, 4) via subsequent DOWN moves (LEFT -> DOWN -> DOWN -> RIGHT).\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (4, 5).

The current direction is UP.\nThe possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse of UP.\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (3, 3). This is a safe move (empty square). It positions the snake closer to the apple at (3, 1) and (1, 1).\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (4, 2). This is a safe move (empty square). It also positions the snake closer to the apple at (3, 1) and (1, 1).\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (4, 4). This is a safe move (empty square). It positions the snake closer to the apple at (4, 6).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT move towards the two apples on the left side. Moving UP seems slightly better as it keeps the snake moving towards the top half of the board where two apples are located. Choosing UP allows for a subsequent LEFT turn towards the apple at (3, 1).\n\nTherefore, I choose UP.\n\nAnswer: UP\n```","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 4).\nThe current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\nMoving UP goes to (2, 4), which is empty.\nMoving LEFT goes to (3, 3), which is empty. This moves towards the apple at (3, 2).\nMoving RIGHT goes to (3, 5), which is empty. This moves away from apples.\nMoving DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse of UP.\n\nTo maximize the score, the snake should move towards the nearest apple. The apple at (3, 2) is the closest. Moving LEFT brings the snake closer to this apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# HS   #\n#     A#\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 2) and its body is at (3, 3). The current direction is LEFT.\nThe possible moves are UP, DOWN, and LEFT. Moving RIGHT is not allowed as it's the reverse of the current direction.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head moves to (2, 2). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head moves to (4, 2). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move.\n3.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (3, 1). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options strategically:\n- There are apples at (1, 1), (4, 6), and (5, 2).\n- The distances from the head (3, 2) are:\n    - To (1, 1): Manhattan distance = |1-3| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n    - To (4, 6): Manhattan distance = |4-3| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n    - To (5, 2): Manhattan distance = |5-3| + |2-2| = 2 + 0 = 2\n- The closest apple is at (5, 2).\n\n- **Moving UP** (to 2, 2) moves away from the closest apple (5, 2) but towards the apple at (1, 1).\n- **Moving LEFT** (to 3, 1) moves away from the closest apple (5, 2) and towards the apple at (1, 1). However, continuing LEFT will hit the wall soon.\n- **Moving DOWN** (to 4, 2) moves directly towards the closest apple at (5, 2). The next move DOWN would eat the apple. This seems like the best short-term strategy.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is the most promising move to eat the nearest apple quickly and safely.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H   A#\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at (4, 2). The body 'S' is at (3, 2). The snake is moving DOWN.\nThe possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (cannot move UP).\n- Moving LEFT: Head moves to (4, 1). Safe, no apple.\n- Moving RIGHT: Head moves to (4, 3). Safe, no apple.\n- Moving DOWN: Head moves to (5, 2). This square contains an apple 'A'. The snake will eat the apple, grow, and the score will increase. This move is safe.\n\nEating the apple is the primary objective. Moving DOWN achieves this immediately and safely.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#A     #\n#A     #\n# S    #\n# S   A#\n# H    #\n#      #\n########\n```\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#A     #\n#      #\n# S   A#\n#HS    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 1) and its body segments are at (5, 2) and (4, 2).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (5, 0), which is a wall '#'. This leads to a game over.\n2.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (4, 1). This square is empty ' '. It is not a wall and not part of the snake's body ((5, 2), (4, 2)). This is a safe move. This move brings the head closer to the apples at (1, 1) and (2, 1).\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (6, 1). This square is empty ' '. It is not a wall and not part of the snake's body ((5, 2), (4, 2)). This is a safe move. This move takes the head further from the apples at (1, 1) and (2, 1).\n\nComparing the safe moves UP and DOWN, moving UP is strategically better as it positions the snake closer to the two apples located at (1, 1) and (2, 1).\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#A     #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#H    A#\n#SS    #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nMy thinking process to decide the next move:\n1.  Identify the snake's head position: H is at row 4, column 1 (0-indexed).\n2.  Identify the current direction: UP.\n3.  Determine possible next moves: Since the current direction is UP, the snake can continue UP, turn LEFT, or turn RIGHT. It cannot turn DOWN.\n4.  Evaluate each possible move:\n    *   **UP:** Move the head to row 3, column 1. This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move and doesn't cause a collision with walls or the snake's body ('S' at (5,1) and (5,2)). This move positions the snake closer to the apples at (1,1) and (2,1).\n    *   **LEFT:** Move the head to row 4, column 0. This square contains a wall ('#'). This move would cause a collision and end the game. This is an invalid move.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Move the head to row 4, column 2. This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move and doesn't cause a collision. This move positions the snake closer to the apple at (4,6), but further from the apples at (1,1) and (2,1).\n5.  Choose the best move: Moving UP is a safe move that positions the snake to potentially eat the apples at (2,1) and (1,1) in the subsequent moves. Moving RIGHT is also safe but moves away from the two closer apples. Therefore, moving UP seems the better strategy for getting closer to apples.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#A     #\n#A     #\n#H     #\n#S    A#\n#S     #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 1). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n1.  Move UP: The head moves to (2, 1). This square contains an apple ('A'). The snake eats the apple, grows, and the score increases. This is a valid and beneficial move.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (3, 0). This square contains a wall ('#'). This results in a collision and game over.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (3, 2). This square is empty. This is a valid move but does not result in eating an apple immediately.\n\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. This is the best move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#S     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 1) and it's moving UP.\nThe possible next positions are:\n1.  Move UP: The head moves to (1, 1). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move. The snake eats the apple, grows longer, and the score increases.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head tries to move to (2, 0). This is a wall ('#'). This move leads to collision.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (2, 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n4.  Move DOWN: This move is invalid because the snake cannot reverse its current direction (UP to DOWN).\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n- Moving UP allows the snake to eat an apple immediately.\n- Moving RIGHT keeps the snake alive but doesn't yield an immediate point.\n\nThe best strategy is generally to eat apples when possible without causing immediate danger. Moving UP allows eating the apple at (1, 1). After moving UP, the head will be at (1, 1), and the body will occupy (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1). From (1, 1), the snake can only move RIGHT to (1, 2) as UP and LEFT lead to walls, and DOWN is blocked by the body. This path seems safe for the next step.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#H A   #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#S     #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 10\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (1, 1) (using 0-based indexing for rows and columns inside the walls).\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies positions (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), and (5, 1).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move DOWN.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (0, 1). This position contains a wall '#'. Collision. Game Over.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (1, 0). This position contains a wall '#'. Collision. Game Over.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (1, 2). This position is empty ' '. This move is safe.\n\nTherefore, the only move that avoids collision is RIGHT. Moving right also positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (1, 3) in the next step.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#SHA   #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n```\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake's head 'H' is at (1, 2).\nThe possible moves are RIGHT, UP, DOWN. LEFT is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n- If I move UP, the head will hit the wall '#' at (0, 2). Game Over.\n- If I move RIGHT, the head will move to (1, 3), which contains an apple 'A'. This is a safe move, and the snake will eat the apple and grow.\n- If I move DOWN, the head will move to (2, 2), which is an empty space ' '. This is a safe move.\n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, increasing the score and length. This aligns with the goal of eating as many apples as possible. Moving DOWN is safe but doesn't yield an immediate reward. Therefore, moving RIGHT is the best option.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#SSH   #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S A  A#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 12\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  The snake head 'H' is at (1, 4). The body 'S' occupies (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2).\n2.  The current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot move LEFT (reverse direction).\n3.  Possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n    *   UP: Move to (0, 4). This is a wall '#'. Collision -> Game Over.\n    *   DOWN: Move to (2, 4). This is an empty square ' '. Safe.\n    *   RIGHT: Move to (1, 5). This is an empty square ' '. Safe.\n4.  There are apples 'A' at (4, 4), (4, 7), and (6, 6).\n5.  Strategy: Evaluate safe moves towards the nearest apple. The apple at (4, 4) is closest.\n    *   Moving DOWN to (2, 4) brings the head closer to the row of the apple at (4, 4). A sequence of DOWN moves (DOWN -> DOWN -> DOWN) leads directly to the apple at (4, 4) and appears safe.\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves away from the apple at (4, 4) initially. Reaching any apple from this position seems to take more steps.\n\nConclusion: Moving DOWN is the better immediate choice as it progresses towards the nearest apple via a clear path.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#SSS   #\n#S H   #\n#S     #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 13\n\nThe snake head is at (2, 3) (row 2, column 3, inside the walls, 0-indexed).\nThe snake body parts are at (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1).\nThe apples are at (4, 2), (4, 6), and (6, 5).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP (reversing direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (2, 2). This square is empty ('.'). It is a valid move. This positions the snake to move towards the apple at (4, 2).\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (2, 4). This square is empty ('.'). It is a valid move. This moves away from the closest apple at (4, 2).\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (3, 3). This square is empty ('.'). It is a valid move. This moves the snake closer vertically to the apple at (4, 2).\n\nComparing LEFT and DOWN: Both moves are safe and allow the snake to pursue the apple at (4, 2). Moving DOWN gets the head to row 3, closer to the apple's row 4. Moving LEFT gets the head to column 2, matching the apple's column.\nLet's evaluate the path to the apple at (4, 2):\n- If move DOWN: Head at (3, 3). Next move LEFT to (3, 2). Next move DOWN to (4, 2) (Apple). Total 3 steps.\n- If move LEFT: Head at (2, 2). Next move DOWN to (3, 2). Next move DOWN to (4, 2) (Apple). Total 3 steps.\n\nBoth paths are equally long. Moving DOWN keeps the snake more central initially and directly moves towards the lower section of the board where all apples currently are. Let's choose DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#SSS   #\n#S S   #\n#  H   #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 14\n\nMy thinking process:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 3).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so UP is not a valid move.\nThe possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN.\n1.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (3, 2). This is an empty space ' '. It's a safe move, but doesn't eat an apple.\n2.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (3, 4). This is an empty space ' '. It's a safe move, but doesn't eat an apple.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (4, 3). This space contains an apple 'A'. Eating the apple increases the score and snake length. This position is not a wall '#' or part of the snake body 'S'. This is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nComparing the options, moving DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is the primary objective besides survival. The position after eating the apple seems safe with space to maneuver. Therefore, DOWN is the best move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#SSS   #\n#S S A #\n#  S   #\n#  H  A#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 15\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 3). The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (cannot move UP).\n1. Move LEFT: Head moves to (4, 2). This is an empty space. It moves away from the nearest apples at (4, 6) and (6, 5).\n2. Move RIGHT: Head moves to (4, 4). This is an empty space. It moves towards the apple at (4, 6). Reaching this apple would take 3 moves (RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT).\n3. Move DOWN: Head moves to (5, 3). This is an empty space. It moves towards the apple at (6, 5). Reaching this apple would take 4 moves (DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN).\n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to reach an apple faster than moving DOWN. Both paths appear safe in the short term. Therefore, moving RIGHT is the preferred move to get closer to the apple at (4, 6).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#SSS   #\n#  S A #\n#  S   #\n#  SH A#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 4). The current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move LEFT.\nThe possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (3, 4). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (5, 4). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (4, 5). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n- Moving UP to (3, 4) positions the snake closer to the apple at (2, 5).\n- Moving DOWN to (5, 4) positions the snake closer to the apple at (6, 6).\n- Moving RIGHT to (4, 5) positions the snake closer to the apples at (2, 5) and (4, 6). Specifically, it is one step away (moving RIGHT again) from the apple at (4, 6) and one step away (moving UP) from being adjacent to the apple at (2, 5).\n\nMoving RIGHT seems strategically advantageous as it keeps options open for two nearby apples and leads directly towards eating the apple at (4, 6) in the subsequent move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n```\n########\n# SS   #\n#  S A #\n#  S   #\n#  SSHA#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 17\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 6).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves are:\n1.

Valid move. Eating the apple will increase the score and snake length.\n4.  LEFT: Move to (4, 5). This position is occupied by the snake's body 'S'. Invalid move (collision). Also, it's the reverse direction, which is not allowed.\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n- Moving UP or DOWN is safe but doesn't yield an immediate point.\n- Moving RIGHT leads to eating an apple immediately. After eating the apple at (4, 7), the snake's head will be at (4, 7), and the length will increase. The only valid move from (4, 7) while moving RIGHT would be DOWN (to 5, 7), as moving UP hits a wall and LEFT is reversing direction relative to the body segment just added. This path seems safe and gets a point.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n# SS   #\n#  S A #\n#  S   #\n#  SSSH#\n#A     #\n#     A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 18\n\nThe snake's head is at coordinates (4, 6) (row 4, column 6). The current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves:\n1.  **RIGHT:** Moving to (4, 7) would hit the wall ('#'), ending the game.\n2.  **LEFT:** This move is disallowed because it's the reverse of the current direction (RIGHT).\n3.  **UP:** Moving to (3, 6). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n4.  **DOWN:** Moving to (5, 6). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nWe need to choose between UP and DOWN. Let's analyze the consequences:\n-   **Move UP:** The head moves to (3, 6). The snake is safe. The next possible moves would be UP (to 2, 6), LEFT (to 3, 5), or RIGHT (to 3, 7 - wall). From (3, 6), moving UP then LEFT, or LEFT then UP would lead to the apple at (2, 5).\n-   **Move DOWN:** The head moves to (5, 6). The snake is safe. The next possible moves would be LEFT (to 5, 5), DOWN (to 6, 6 - apple!), or RIGHT (to 5, 7 - wall). Moving DOWN in the next step allows the snake to eat the apple at (6, 6).\n\nComparing the two valid moves:\n- Moving UP positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (2, 5) in two more moves.\n- Moving DOWN positions the snake to eat the apple at (6, 6) in the very next move.\n\nEating an apple sooner is generally better. Moving DOWN leads directly towards the apple at (6, 6), allowing the snake to eat it in the subsequent turn. This seems like the most advantageous move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n```\n########\n#  S   #\n#  S A #\n#  S   #\n#  SSSS#\n#A    H#\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nAnalyze possible moves:\n1.  **UP:** Invalid move, as the snake cannot reverse its direction (current direction is DOWN).\n2.  **LEFT:** The head would move to (5, 5).

From (6, 2), the next possible moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT (direction is LEFT).\n    *   UP goes to (5, 2), which is empty. This path allows moving towards the apple at (5, 0).\n    *   DOWN goes to (7, 2), which is a wall '#' -> collision.\n    *   LEFT goes to (6, 1), which is empty. This path also allows moving towards the apple at (5, 0).\n    Moving LEFT provides safe subsequent moves and a path towards an apple.\n\nComparing the two options, moving LEFT is the safer choice as moving UP leads to an unavoidable collision within two moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#  SSSS#\n#A    S#\n#  HSSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 23\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (6, 2).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT because that would be reversing its direction.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n1.  **Check DOWN:** Moving DOWN would lead to (7, 2).

This move is valid.\n3.  **Check UP:** Moving UP would lead to (5, 2). This position is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the valid moves (LEFT and UP) to choose the best one. The goal is to eat apples and survive. There are apples at (2, 4), (2, 5), and (5, 0).\n\n-   **If I move LEFT:** The head moves to (6, 1). The direction becomes LEFT. The nearest apple is at (5, 0). From (6, 1), I could move UP to (5, 1) and then LEFT to (5, 0) to eat the apple.\n-   **If I move UP:** The head moves to (5, 2). The direction becomes UP. The nearest apple is at (5, 0). From (5, 2), I can move LEFT to (5, 1) and then LEFT again to (5, 0) to eat the apple.\n\nBoth moves allow the snake to reach the apple at (5, 0) in two subsequent steps. Moving UP positions the snake slightly higher on the board, which might be advantageous for reaching the apples at (2, 4) and (2, 5) later. It also seems to leave more open space around the tail compared to moving LEFT first. Therefore, moving UP is a good strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#   SSS#\n#A H  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 24\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 2). The current direction is UP. The snake cannot move DOWN.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (4, 2). This square is empty. This is a safe move.\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (5, 1). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a safe move, eats an apple, and increases the score.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (5, 3). This square is empty. This is a safe move.\n\nTo maximize the score, eating the apple is the priority. Moving LEFT achieves this. Let's check the consequences of moving LEFT:\n- New head position: (5, 1)\n- New direction: LEFT\n- Snake grows: The old head position (5, 2) becomes part of the body.\n- Next possible moves from (5, 1) (direction LEFT): UP to (4, 1) (empty), LEFT to (5, 0) (wall, death), DOWN to (6, 1) (empty). There are safe moves available after eating the apple.\n\nMoving UP to (4, 2) (direction UP): Next possible moves: UP to (3, 2) (empty), LEFT to (4, 1) (empty), RIGHT to (4, 3) (body, death). This path leads towards the upper apples but restricts movement to the right.\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 3) (direction RIGHT): Next possible moves: UP to (4, 3) (body, death), RIGHT to (5, 4) (empty), DOWN to (6, 3) (body, death). This path is very dangerous, likely leading to death.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is the best option as it immediately scores a point and leaves safe options for the next turn.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#    SS#\n#AHS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (5, 2) (row 5, column 2, 0-indexed).\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT.\nThe possible moves are:\n1.  Continue LEFT: The head would move to (5, 1). This square contains an apple 'A'. This move is valid. Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and the snake's length by 1.\n2.  Turn UP: The head would move to (4, 2). This square is empty ' '. This move is valid.\n3.  Turn DOWN: The head would move to (6, 2). This square contains a part of the snake's body 'S'. This move is invalid as it results in a collision with the snake itself.\n4.  Turn RIGHT: This move is invalid because the snake cannot reverse its direction (it's currently moving LEFT).\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n- Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, increasing the score. The position after moving LEFT is (5, 1). From (5, 1), the snake must move UP or DOWN. Moving DOWN leads to a collision with the body at (6, 2) after the next move (RIGHT). Moving UP to (4, 1) is safe and allows further movement.\n- Moving UP moves the snake to an empty square (4, 2). From here, the snake could potentially move LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. Moving LEFT to (4, 1) and then DOWN to (5, 1) would eat the apple, but this takes more steps.\n\nEating the apple immediately by moving LEFT is the most beneficial move, and the subsequent mandatory move UP appears safe.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#A   SS#\n#HSS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 26\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Check LEFT: Moving to (5, 0) hits a wall '#'. Game over.\n6. Check UP: Moving to (4, 1) lands on an apple 'A'. This is a safe move, eats an apple, and increases the score.\n7. Check DOWN: Moving to (6, 1) lands on an empty space ' '. This is a safe move initially. However, let's look one step ahead: after moving DOWN, the head is at (6, 1) and the direction is DOWN. The next possible moves are UP (hits body at 5,1), LEFT (hits wall at 6,0), DOWN (hits wall at 7,1). This leads to a dead end immediately.\n8. Comparing UP and DOWN: Moving UP eats an apple and keeps the snake alive. Moving DOWN leads to a guaranteed game over in the next step.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#A     #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#H   SS#\n#SSS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n```\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 1).\nThe current direction is 'UP'.\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies several squares.\nApples 'A' are at (1, 1), (2, 4), and (2, 5).\n\nPossible moves from (4, 1) with direction 'UP':\n1.  **UP**: Move to (3, 1).

This is a valid move.\n4.  **DOWN**: Cannot move 'DOWN' as the current direction is 'UP' (reversing direction is not allowed).\n\nComparing valid moves:\n-   **UP**: Moves the snake towards the apple at (1, 1). The path (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 1) seems clear and safe for now.\n-   **RIGHT**: Moves the snake to (4, 2). This position is safe but moves away from the closest apple.\n\nThe best strategy is usually to move towards the nearest apple if the path is safe. Moving UP leads directly towards the apple at (1, 1) and is a safe move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#    AA#\n#H     #\n#S    S#\n#SSS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 28\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (3, 1).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN because it would be reversing direction.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Check LEFT:** Moving LEFT would move the head to (3, 0), which is a wall '#'.

This square is empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n\nNow we need to decide between UP and RIGHT.\n- Moving UP to (2, 1) brings the snake closer to the apple at (1, 1). The next move UP would eat the apple.\n- Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) moves the snake towards the center of the board, away from the closest apple but potentially towards the apples at (2, 4) and (2, 5).\n\nConsidering the goal is to eat apples, moving UP is the most direct path to the nearest apple at (1, 1). Let's check if the path after eating the apple is safe. If we move UP to (2,1), then UP again to (1,1) (eat apple), the head will be at (1,1), and the direction will be UP.

This square contains 'A' (an apple). Eating the apple is good, but let's check the next possible moves from (2, 7). After eating the apple, the head is at (2, 7) and the snake is moving RIGHT. The only possible non-reversing moves are UP and DOWN.\n    *   Moving UP from (2, 7) leads to (1, 7), which is a wall ('#'). Collision. Game Over.\n    *   Moving DOWN from (2, 7) leads to (3, 7), which is a wall ('#'). Collision. Game Over.\n    *   Therefore, moving RIGHT leads to eating an apple but results in an immediate game over in the next step.\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n*   UP: Collision.\n*   DOWN: Safe move. Leads to an empty square (3, 6). From there, the snake could potentially move LEFT to eat the apple at (3, 5) or DOWN to (4, 6).\n*   RIGHT: Eats an apple but leads to an immediate trap and collision with the wall.\n\nThe only safe move that doesn't lead to an immediate game over is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#SS    #\n#SSSSSA#\n#S   H #\n#S A   #\n#SSS A #\n#  SS  #\n########\n```\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#SS    #\n#SSSSSA#\n#S   S #\n#S A H #\n#SSS A #\n#  S   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 6).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible next moves:\n1.

Safe.\n\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. This increases the score and length. After moving LEFT, the head will be at (4, 2), the new body segment will be at (4, 3), and the direction will be LEFT. From (4, 2), moving LEFT again would lead to eating the apple at (4, 1). This seems like a good path.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#AHS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 2), and the body is at (4, 3). The current direction is LEFT.\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN. Moving RIGHT is not allowed.\n- Moving LEFT: The head moves to (4, 1). This square contains an apple 'A'. The move is valid and results in eating an apple.\n- Moving UP: The head moves to (3, 2). This square is empty ' '. The move is valid.\n- Moving DOWN: The head moves to (5, 2). This square contains an apple 'A'. The move is valid and results in eating an apple.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN lead to eating an apple immediately. Moving LEFT continues the current line of movement and eats the apple directly in front. Moving DOWN requires a turn and eats the apple below. Both are good moves. Let's choose LEFT as it requires no change in direction column-wise.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#HSS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 1). The body segments are at (4, 2) and (4, 3). The current direction is LEFT.\nPossible moves:\n1.  Continue LEFT: Move to (4, 0). This is a wall '#'. Collision. Game Over.\n2.  Turn UP: Move to (3, 1). This is an empty square ' '. Safe move.\n3.  Turn DOWN: Move to (5, 1). This is an empty square ' '. Safe move.\n4.  Turn RIGHT: This is the reverse of the current direction (LEFT), so it's an invalid move.\n\nWe must choose between UP and DOWN.\n- If we move UP to (3, 1), the nearest apple is at (1, 1), two steps away (UP, UP). The apple at (3, 4) is three steps away (RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT). The apple at (5, 2) is three steps away (DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT).\n- If we move DOWN to (5, 1), the nearest apple is at (5, 2), one step away (RIGHT).\n\nMoving DOWN puts the snake in a position to eat an apple in the next turn. Therefore, DOWN is the better strategic move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head is at (row 5, col 1).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible next moves are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (cannot move UP as it's the reverse direction).\n1.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (5, 0), which is a wall ('#'). This leads to a collision and game over.\n2.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (6, 1), which is an empty space (' '). This is a safe move but doesn't eat an apple.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (5, 2), which contains an apple ('A'). This is a safe move, eats an apple, increases the score, and grows the snake.\n\nEating the apple is the primary goal besides survival. Moving RIGHT achieves this immediately and safely.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#SSA   #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 2) (row 5, column 2, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies positions (5, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 2).\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move to (4, 2). This position is occupied by the snake's body 'S'. This move would result in a collision and end the game. Invalid move.\n2.  DOWN: Move to (6, 2). This position is empty. Valid move.\n3.  LEFT: The current direction is RIGHT, so moving LEFT is not allowed (cannot reverse direction). Invalid move.\n4.  RIGHT: Move to (5, 3). This position is empty. Valid move.\n\nWe need to choose between DOWN and RIGHT. Let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   Move DOWN: The head moves to (6, 2). This moves the snake further away from the apples located at (1, 1), (3, 4), and (4, 4).\n*   Move RIGHT: The head moves to (5, 3). This position is closer to the apples at (3, 4) and (4, 4). From (5, 3), the snake can move UP to (4, 3) and then RIGHT to (4, 4) to eat the apple there. This seems like a good path to score points.\n\nMoving RIGHT positions the snake better to reach the nearby apples compared to moving DOWN. It is a safe move and progresses towards the goal of eating apples.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#S A   #\n#SSH   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nBased on the current board state and the goal of eating apples while avoiding collision, the snake's head is at (5, 4) and it's moving RIGHT. The possible next moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (cannot move LEFT as it's the opposite direction).\n\n1.  **Move RIGHT:** Head moves to (5, 5). This is a safe move into an empty space, but moves further away from the nearest apples at (4, 3) and (3, 4).\n2.  **Move UP:** Head moves to (4, 4). This is a safe move into an empty space. It positions the snake closer to the apple at (3, 4) and adjacent to the apple at (4, 3). This is a good strategic move towards apples.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** Head moves to (6, 4). This is a safe move into an empty space, but moves away from the apples.\n\nMoving UP positions the snake optimally to target the nearby apples in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A A#\n#S H   #\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 3). The current direction is UP. The snake cannot move DOWN.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (3, 3). This position is empty (' '). This move is safe. It moves the snake closer to the apples at (3, 4) and (3, 6).\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (4, 2). This position is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This move leads to a collision. This move is invalid.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (4, 4). This position is empty (' '). This move is safe. It moves the snake closer to the apples at (3, 4) and (3, 6).\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe moves and position the snake one step away (Manhattan distance) from the apple at (3, 4).\n- If we move UP to (3, 3), the next move can be RIGHT to eat the apple at (3, 4).\n- If we move RIGHT to (4, 4), the next move can be UP to eat the apple at (3, 4).\n\nMoving UP to (3, 3) leaves three possible directions for the subsequent move (UP, LEFT, RIGHT), whereas moving RIGHT to (4, 4) leaves only two safe subsequent directions (UP, RIGHT), as DOWN would collide with the body segment that will be at (5, 4). Therefore, moving UP maintains more flexibility.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#  HA A#\n#  S   #\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (3, 3).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (2, 3). This position is empty (' '). It is a valid and safe move. The snake would move away from the apples at (3, 5) and (3, 6) but towards the apple at (1, 1).\n2.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (3, 2). This position is empty (' '). It is a valid and safe move.

It is a valid and safe move. This move positions the snake next to the apple at (3, 5), allowing it to potentially eat it on the next turn by moving RIGHT again.\n\nComparing the options:\n- Moving UP or LEFT moves towards the apple at (1, 1), which is further away.\n- Moving RIGHT moves towards the apples at (3, 5) and (3, 6), putting the snake in position to eat the apple at (3, 5) in the next step.\n\nEating apples is the goal. Moving RIGHT provides the quickest path to the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#  SH A#\n#  S   #\n#SSS   #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 4). The current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot move LEFT.\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head moves to (2, 4). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head moves to (4, 4). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (3, 5). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nThere is an apple at (3, 6). Moving RIGHT takes the snake one step closer to this apple. If the snake moves RIGHT twice, it will eat the apple.\nLet's check the path:\n- Move RIGHT: Head to (3, 5). Safe.\n- Move RIGHT again: Head to (3, 6). Eats apple. Safe.\n\nLet's check the other options briefly:\n- Move UP: Head to (2, 4). Moves away from the nearest apple at (3, 6), but towards the apple at (1, 1).\n- Move DOWN: Head to (4, 4). Moves away from the apple at (3, 6), but towards the apple at (6, 1).\n\nMoving RIGHT is the most direct path to the nearest apple and seems safe.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#  SSHA#\n#  S   #\n# SS   #\n#A     #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 5) and moving RIGHT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT is invalid as it's the reverse direction.\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (2, 5). This is an empty space, a valid move.\n2.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (4, 5). This is an empty space, a valid move.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (3, 6). This space contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move, and eating the apple increases the score and snake length.\n\nEating the apple is the primary objective. Moving RIGHT achieves this immediately and leads to a safe position.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#  SSSH#\n#  S   #\n# SS   #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 6) (row 3, column 6).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nIf the snake continues RIGHT, it will move to (3, 7), which is a wall '#'. This will result in a game over.\nThe snake cannot move LEFT because that is the reverse of the current direction.\nThe possible moves are UP or DOWN.\nMoving UP: The head will move to (2, 6). This square is empty, so the move is safe.\nMoving DOWN: The head will move to (4, 6). This square is empty, so the move is safe.\n\nTo survive, the snake must turn either UP or DOWN. Turning UP moves the head towards the upper part of the board where there are apples at (1, 1) and (2, 2). Turning DOWN moves the head towards the lower part of the board where there is an apple at (6, 1). Both moves avoid immediate collision. Let's choose UP as it moves away from the immediate wall danger and positions the snake potentially closer to two apples.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n# A   H#\n#  SSSS#\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 12\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 6) (row 2, column 6, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move UP because there is a wall at (1, 6).\nThe snake cannot move DOWN because that would be reversing direction.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT because there is a wall at (2, 7).\nThe only possible move is LEFT to position (2, 5).

Move UP: The head would move to (0, 5), which is a wall '#'. This leads to game over.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (1, 4), which is empty ' '. This is a valid move. It positions the snake closer to the apples at (1, 1) and (2, 2).\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (1, 6), which is empty ' '. This is also a valid move, but moves away from the closest apples and towards the right wall.\n\nMoving LEFT is a safe move that progresses towards the apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n########\n#A  HS #\n# A  SS#\n#   SSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 15\n\nAnalyze the possible moves:\n1.  **LEFT**: Move head from (1, 4) to (1, 3). This square is empty. This move is valid and safe. It moves towards apples at (1, 1) and (2, 2).\n2.  **RIGHT**: Cannot move RIGHT because the current direction is LEFT.\n3.  **UP**: Move head from (1, 4) to (0, 4). This square is a wall '#'. This move leads to collision.\n4.  **DOWN**: Move head from (1, 4) to (2, 4). This square is empty. This move is valid and safe. It moves towards the apple at (2, 2).\n\nComparing safe moves LEFT and DOWN:\n- Moving LEFT goes to (1, 3). The snake stays close to the top wall. It positions the head closer to both apples at (1, 1) and (2, 2).\n- Moving DOWN goes to (2, 4). The snake moves away from the top wall towards a slightly more open area. It positions the head closer to the apple at (2, 2).\n\nBoth moves are safe and move towards an apple. Moving DOWN shifts the snake's head towards the center of the board, potentially offering more maneuvering space in the future compared to moving LEFT, which keeps the snake closer to the top edge and the corner apple. Therefore, DOWN is chosen as a slightly better strategic move for long-term survival.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#A  SS #\n# A HSS#\n#    SS#\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nThe current direction is DOWN.

This square is empty. This move is valid. It moves towards the apple at (1, 1).\n2.  **LEFT:** Move to (2, 1). This square is empty. This move is valid. It moves towards the apples at (1, 1) and (6, 1).\n3.  **DOWN:** Move to (3, 2). This square is empty. This move is valid. It moves towards the apple at (5, 2).\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n- Moving UP or LEFT leads towards the apple at (1, 1). The area near the top border seems somewhat constrained by the snake's own body ((1,4), (1,5), etc.).\n- Moving DOWN leads towards the apple at (5, 2). The path (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN) seems clear, and the lower part of the board has more open space and another apple at (6, 1).

Move LEFT: The head would move to (4, 1). This square is empty ('.'). This is a valid move. It moves towards the apples at (5, 1) and (6, 1).\n2.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (4, 3).

Also, (6, 1) is occupied by the snake's body 'S'.\n\nWe need to choose between UP and RIGHT.\nThe apples at (1, 1) and (1, 2) are currently hard to reach due to the snake's body configuration.\nThe apple at (4, 6) is reachable.\n\nLet's analyze the path to the apple at (4, 6) for both valid moves:\n-   If we move **UP** to (5, 2): A possible path to (4, 6) is UP -> UP -> RIGHT -> RIGHT -> RIGHT -> RIGHT -> DOWN (7 moves to reach (3, 6) then down to (4,6)). This path seems complex and potentially risky near the snake's body.\n-   If we move **RIGHT** to (6, 3): A possible path to (4, 6) is UP -> UP -> RIGHT -> RIGHT -> RIGHT (5 moves after the initial RIGHT move). The sequence would be RIGHT -> UP -> UP -> RIGHT -> RIGHT -> RIGHT. This path seems shorter and potentially safer.\n\nMoving RIGHT keeps the snake lower initially and provides a more direct route towards the apple at (4, 6). It avoids immediate proximity to the body part at (5, 1) compared to moving UP.

This square contains a wall '#'. This is an invalid move (collision).\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (6, 5). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n\nWe need to choose between UP and RIGHT.\n- Moving UP leads to position (5, 4). From there, the snake could potentially move towards the apple at (4, 6) or the apples at (1, 1) and (1, 2). It moves the snake away from the bottom edge.\n- Moving RIGHT leads to position (6, 5). This keeps the snake near the bottom edge. From (6, 5), the next move RIGHT (to 6, 6) is possible but gets very close to the wall and body. Moving UP from (6, 5) to (5, 5) is also possible and leads towards the apple at (4, 6).\n\nMoving UP seems slightly safer as it moves the head away from the immediate vicinity of the bottom wall and potentially opens up more maneuvering space towards the upper part of the board where two apples are located, while still allowing a path to the apple on the right.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#AA    #\n# SSS  #\n# S    #\n# S   A#\n#SSH   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 26\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5, 4).

Turn DOWN: Cannot reverse direction from UP to DOWN. Invalid move.\n\nThe valid moves are UP and RIGHT.\n\nLet's analyze the valid moves:\n-   Move UP: The head moves to (4, 4). This moves the snake towards the apple at (4, 6) vertically. The path to this apple would likely be RIGHT, RIGHT.\n-   Move RIGHT: The head moves to (5, 5). This moves the snake towards the apple at (4, 6) horizontally. The path to this apple would likely be UP, RIGHT.\n\nBoth moves are safe and allow progress towards the nearest apple at (4, 6). Moving UP maintains the current direction for one more step and positions the snake slightly higher, potentially offering more maneuvering room later compared to moving RIGHT, which keeps the snake lower near its existing body segments. Let's choose UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#AA    #\n# SS   #\n# S    #\n# SH  A#\n#SSS   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 27\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\n1.  The snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 4).\n2.  The current direction is 'UP'.\n3.  The snake cannot move 'DOWN' because it's the reverse direction.\n4.

From there, the snake can continue moving towards the apples at the top or potentially turn right towards the apple at (4, 6).\n    *   Moving RIGHT leads to (5, 5). From this position, a subsequent 'RIGHT' move would lead to eating the apple at (5, 6). This seems like a more direct path to an immediate score increase.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is a safe move that sets up eating an apple in the next step.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#AA    #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# SSH A#\n#SSS   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n```\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#AA    #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# SSSHA#\n#SSS   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 29\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 5).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.

The snake will eat the apple, grow longer, and the score will increase. This is a valid move.\n\nEating the apple is beneficial. Moving RIGHT to (4, 6) achieves this. After moving RIGHT, the head will be at (4, 6), and the direction will still be RIGHT. The next possible moves from (4, 6) would be UP to (3, 6) (empty), DOWN to (5, 6) (empty), or RIGHT to (4, 7) (wall, game over). So, after eating the apple, the snake must turn UP or DOWN.

LEFT: Invalid move, as the snake cannot reverse its direction (currently moving RIGHT).\n4.  RIGHT: Move to (4, 8). This square is a wall ('#'). This move leads to game over.\n\nBetween UP and DOWN, both are safe for the next step. Moving UP brings the head to (3, 7), positioning it on the same row as the apple at (3, 1) and moving away from the dense body segments below. Moving DOWN brings the head to (5, 7), closer to the lower body segments. Moving UP seems slightly more advantageous for accessing the nearest apple and avoiding self-collision in the near future.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#A    H#\n# SSSSS#\n#SSS   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 31\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (3, 6).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\nMoving RIGHT would collide with the wall '#' at (3, 7).\nThe possible moves are UP to (2, 6) or LEFT to (3, 5). Both squares are empty.\n\nLet's analyze the consequences of each move:\n\n1.  Move UP: The head moves to (2, 6). This position is safe. From here, the snake can move LEFT towards the apples. A possible path to eat apples: UP -> LEFT (to 2,5) -> LEFT (to 2,4) -> LEFT (to 2,3) -> LEFT (to 2,2) -> LEFT (to 2,1) -> UP (to 1,1, Eat Apple) -> RIGHT (to 1,2, Eat Apple) -> RIGHT (to 1,3) -> ... -> DOWN -> DOWN -> LEFT (to 3,1, Eat Apple). However, following this path leads to a self-collision later when trying to reach the last apple at (3,1). Specifically, after eating at (1,1) and (1,2) and moving along the top row then down, the snake head at (3,6) would collide with its body segment at (3,6) which was placed two moves prior.\n\n2.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (3, 5). This position is safe. This move positions the snake to directly target the apple at (3, 1) by continuing LEFT. A possible path: LEFT (to 3,5) -> LEFT (to 3,4) -> LEFT (to 3,3) -> LEFT (to 3,2) -> LEFT (to 3,1, Eat Apple). After eating this apple, the snake can move UP to (2,1), then UP again to (1,1, Eat Apple), then RIGHT to (1,2, Eat Apple). After eating all apples, the head is at (1,2) moving RIGHT, and there are clear paths (RIGHT to (1,3) or DOWN to (2,2)) to continue without collision.\n\nComparing the two options, moving LEFT provides a safer path to eat all three remaining apples without leading into a trap or forced collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#A   HS#\n#  SSSS#\n#SSS   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 32\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 5). The current direction is LEFT.\nThe possible next moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (cannot move RIGHT, the opposite direction).\n\n1.  **Check move LEFT**: The head moves to (3, 4). This square is empty (' '). This move is valid. This move brings the snake closer to the apple at (3, 1).\n2.  **Check move UP**: The head moves to (2, 5). This square is empty (' '). This move is valid. This move positions the snake to potentially target the apples at (1, 1) and (1, 2).\n3.  **Check move DOWN**: The head moves to (4, 5). This square contains a part of the snake's body ('S'). This move is invalid as it leads to a self-collision.\n\nBetween LEFT and UP:\n-   Moving LEFT positions the head at (3, 4), facing LEFT. Subsequent LEFT moves (to 3,3 -> 3,2 -> 3,1) would lead directly to the apple at (3, 1). After eating the apple at (3, 1), the head would be at (3, 1), still facing LEFT. The only possible non-collision move from there would be UP towards (2, 1), which then allows moving UP again to eat the apple at (1, 1). This seems like a safe and productive path.\n-   Moving UP positions the head at (2, 5), facing UP. From here, moving LEFT repeatedly could lead towards the apples at (1, 1), (1, 2), or (3, 1), but requires more turns and might lead into tighter spaces, especially considering the snake's length. For instance, reaching (3,1) from this path might lead to a dead end after eating it.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is the more strategic choice as it heads directly towards the nearest apple via a clear path and sets up a good subsequent move towards another apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n########\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#A  HSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#S S   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 33\n\nPossible moves:\n1.

This square is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). Invalid (collision).\n4.  RIGHT: Reverse of the current direction (LEFT). Invalid.\n\nComparing valid moves:\n- Moving UP (to 2, 4) is safe but moves away from the nearest apple at (3, 1). It moves towards the apples at (1, 1) and (1, 2).\n- Moving LEFT (to 3, 3) is safe and moves towards the apple at (3, 1). This apple can be reached in two more moves (LEFT, LEFT).\n\nChoosing the move that leads towards the nearest apple is generally a good strategy. Moving LEFT positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (3, 1) quickly.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#A HSSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#  S   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at row 3, column 2 (using 0-based indexing for rows and columns inside the walls). The current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction). The possible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The square to the left of the head (3, 1) contains an apple 'A'. Moving here is safe (no wall, no body collision) and results in eating the apple, increasing the score, and growing the snake. The new head position would be (3, 1).\n2.  **Move UP:** The square above the head (2, 2) is empty ' '. Moving here is safe. The new head position would be (2, 2). This move positions the snake closer to the two apples in the top row.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The square below the head (4, 2) is empty ' '. Moving here is safe. The new head position would be (4, 2). This moves the snake further into the area occupied by its body.\n\nComparing the options:\n- Moving LEFT immediately scores a point by eating the apple at (3, 1). After this move, the snake would be at (3, 1) and still moving LEFT (though it must turn UP or DOWN next). From (3, 1), moving UP leads towards the remaining apples.\n- Moving UP positions the snake well to potentially eat the two apples at (1, 1) and (1, 2) in subsequent moves.\n- Moving DOWN seems less advantageous as it moves into a more crowded area away from the apples.\n\nBoth LEFT and UP are reasonable moves. LEFT provides an immediate score increase. UP sets up a path for future apples. Since scoring immediately is beneficial and the subsequent path seems safe, moving LEFT is a good strategy.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#AHSSSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#  S   #\n# SS   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 35\n\nMy analysis:\n1.  The snake's head 'H' is at row 4, column 2 (using 1-based indexing from the top-left corner of the playable area).\n2.  The current direction is LEFT.\n3.  The snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move RIGHT.\n4.  Possible moves are UP, DOWN, or continuing LEFT.\n5.  Check move LEFT: The square at (4, 1) contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move, safe, and results in eating an apple.\n6.  Check move UP: The square at (3, 2) is empty ' '. This is a valid and safe move.\n7.  Check move DOWN: The square at (5, 2) is empty ' '. This is a valid and safe move.\n8.  Strategic consideration:\n    *   Moving LEFT eats an apple immediately. The snake will then be at the left edge and likely needs to turn UP.\n    *   Moving UP positions the snake at (3, 2), closer to the apple at (3, 1) and the cluster of apples at (1, 1) and (1, 2). This seems like a good strategic move to access the remaining apples.\n    *   Moving DOWN moves the snake away from all apples.\n9.  Comparing LEFT and UP: Both are safe. UP seems slightly better for long-term positioning to collect the remaining apples efficiently, especially the cluster in the top-left.\n\nTherefore, I choose to move UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#AA    #\n# H    #\n#ASSSSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 36\n\nAnalyze the current situation:\n1.  The snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (2, 2) (row 2, column 2, 0-indexed inside the walls).\n2.  The snake is currently moving UP. Therefore, it cannot move DOWN in the next step.\n3.  Possible next moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n4.  There are three apples 'A' on the board at (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 1).\n5.  The snake's body 'S' occupies several squares, mainly in rows 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nEvaluate possible moves:\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (1, 2). This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is beneficial (increases score and length). The square is not a wall and not part of the snake's body. This move is valid and scores a point. After this move, the direction remains UP. Possible next moves would be LEFT or RIGHT (UP hits a wall, DOWN is reversing). Moving LEFT would target the apple at (1,1).\n2.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (2, 1). This square is empty. This move is valid (not a wall or body part). After this move, the direction would be LEFT. Possible next moves would be UP or DOWN (LEFT hits a wall, RIGHT is reversing). Moving UP leads to the apple at (1,1), moving DOWN leads to the apple at (3,1).\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (2, 3). This square is empty. This move is valid (not a wall or body part). After this move, the direction would be RIGHT. Possible next moves would be UP or DOWN or RIGHT (LEFT is reversing). Moving DOWN to (3,3) would hit the snake's body. Moving UP leads to (1,3) (empty), moving RIGHT leads to (2,4) (empty).\n\nComparison:\n- Moving UP immediately captures an apple at (1, 2). The subsequent move LEFT allows capturing the apple at (1, 1). This path seems promising for getting two apples quickly.\n- Moving LEFT first leads to (2, 1). From there, moving UP captures the apple at (1, 1), and then moving RIGHT captures the apple at (1, 2). This also gets two apples quickly.\n- Moving RIGHT seems less optimal as it doesn't immediately target an apple and potentially leads towards the snake's body sooner.\n\nLet's trace the UP path further: UP -> LEFT -> DOWN -> DOWN seems to collect all apples and remain safe (as analyzed in thought block).\nLet's trace the LEFT path further: LEFT -> UP -> RIGHT leads to a state where accessing the third apple at (3,1) becomes problematic, potentially leading to a crash.\n\nTherefore, moving UP seems to be the best strategic choice as it leads to collecting all apples safely.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#AH    #\n# S    #\n#ASSSSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#  S  A#\n#  S   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 37\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1.  **UP**: The snake's head is at (1, 2). Moving UP would lead to (0, 2), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, and the game ends. Invalid move.\n2.  **DOWN**: The current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction directly. Invalid move.\n3.  **LEFT**: The snake's head is at (1, 2). Moving LEFT would lead to (1, 1), which contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move. The snake eats the apple and grows. The new head position would be (1, 1), and the direction would be LEFT. From (1, 1) moving LEFT, the next only valid move would be DOWN to (2, 1). From (2, 1) moving DOWN, the next only valid move would be RIGHT to (2, 2), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This leads to a collision. So, moving LEFT leads to a trap.\n4.  **RIGHT**: The snake's head is at (1, 2). Moving RIGHT would lead to (1, 3), which is an empty square (' '). This is a valid move. The new head position would be (1, 3), and the direction would be RIGHT. From (1, 3) moving RIGHT, the snake can move DOWN to (2, 3), which is empty. This path seems safer and allows for more future moves.\n\nComparing LEFT and RIGHT: Moving LEFT gets an apple immediately but leads to a certain collision shortly after. Moving RIGHT keeps the snake alive and provides access to more open space. Therefore, survival takes precedence over immediately eating the apple in this situation.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n#ASH   #\n# S    #\n#ASSSSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#  S  A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 38\n\nMy analysis:\n1.

The next possible moves are RIGHT (to 2, 4 - empty), UP (to 1, 3 - becomes body 'S'), or DOWN (to 3, 3 - body 'S'). Only RIGHT is possible in the next step.\n\nMoving RIGHT keeps more options open for the subsequent move compared to moving DOWN, which immediately forces a RIGHT turn. Therefore, moving RIGHT seems like a better short-term strategy to maintain flexibility.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#ASSH  #\n# S    #\n#ASSSSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 39\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (1, 5) (row 1, column 5, using 0-based indexing for rows and columns starting from the top-left corner).\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move LEFT.\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  Move UP: The square at (0, 5) is a wall '#'. This move leads to collision and game over.\n2.  Move DOWN: The square at (2, 5) is empty '.'. This is a valid and safe move.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The square at (1, 6) is empty '.'. This is a valid and safe move.\n\nLet's evaluate the valid moves:\n- Moving DOWN to (2, 5): This keeps the snake away from the top wall and allows potential subsequent moves LEFT to (2, 4) or RIGHT to (2, 6).\n- Moving RIGHT to (1, 6): This moves the snake closer to the right wall. The only valid move from (1, 6) would be DOWN to (2, 6), as UP hits the top wall and RIGHT hits the side wall.\n\nBoth moves lead into tight spaces eventually, given the snake's length and position. However, moving DOWN offers slightly more options in the immediate next step compared to moving RIGHT, which forces the subsequent move to be DOWN. Therefore, DOWN is a reasonable choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#ASSS  #\n# S H  #\n#ASSSSS#\n#   SSS#\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 40\n\nBased on the current board and direction:\n- Moving DOWN would lead the head 'H' at (3, 5) to position (4, 5), which is occupied by the snake body 'S'. This results in a collision.\n- Moving LEFT would lead the head 'H' at (3, 5) to position (3, 4), which is occupied by the snake body 'S'. This results in a collision.\n- Moving RIGHT would lead the head 'H' at (3, 5) to position (3, 6), which is an empty space ' '. This is a safe move.\n- Moving UP is not allowed because the current direction is DOWN (cannot reverse direction).\n\nTherefore, the only safe move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#ASSS  #\n# S SH #\n#ASSSSS#\n#    SS#\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at row 2, column 6 (H).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nWe need to determine the next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, but since the current direction is RIGHT, moving LEFT is allowed (it's not the direct opposite). However, we must check for collisions.\n\n1.  **Check UP:** The position above the head is (1, 6). This square is empty (' '). Moving UP is safe.\n2.  **Check DOWN:** The position below the head is (3, 6). This square contains 'S' (snake body). Moving DOWN would cause a collision.\n3.  **Check LEFT:** The position to the left of the head is (2, 5). This square contains 'S' (snake body). Moving LEFT would cause a collision.\n4.  **Check RIGHT:** The position to the right of the head is (2, 7). This square contains '#' (wall). Moving RIGHT would cause a collision.\n\nThe only safe move to avoid immediate collision is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#ASSSH #\n# S SS #\n#ASSSSS#\n#     S#\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nThe snake's head is at (1, 6).\nThe current direction is UP.\nPossible moves:\n1.  Move UP: The head moves to (0, 6), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (1, 5), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a collision.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (1, 7), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision.\n4.  Move DOWN: This move is invalid because the snake cannot reverse its current direction (UP).\n\nAll valid moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) lead to a game over. Since there is no move to survive, any of these three directions will end the game. I will choose LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

This position is empty and safe.\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (4, 2). This position is empty and safe.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (4, 4). This position is empty and safe.\n\nNow, let's consider the positions of the apples: (1, 1), (2, 6), (5, 1).\nWe want to choose a move that gets us closer to an apple without risking collision.\n\n*   If we move UP to (3, 3):\n    *   Closest apple (1, 1) is 4 steps away (UP, UP, LEFT, LEFT).\n    *   Closest apple (2, 6) is 4 steps away (UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT).\n    *   Closest apple (5, 1) is 4 steps away (LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN).\n*   If we move LEFT to (4, 2):\n    *   Closest apple (5, 1) is 2 steps away (DOWN, LEFT).\n    *   Closest apple (1, 1) is 4 steps away (UP, UP, UP, LEFT).\n    *   Closest apple (2, 6) is 6 steps away (UP, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT).\n*   If we move RIGHT to (4, 4):\n    *   Closest apple (2, 6) is 4 steps away (UP, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT).\n    *   Closest apple (1, 1) is 6 steps away (UP, UP, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP).\n    *   Closest apple (5, 1) is 6 steps away (DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP).\n\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to reach the apple at (5, 1) in the fewest steps (2 steps: DOWN, then LEFT). This seems like the most efficient move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# H    #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at (4, 2).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The snake head moves to (4, 1). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid move. This moves closer to the apple at (5, 1) and (1, 1).\n2.  **Move UP:** The snake head moves to (3, 2). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid move. This moves away from the apple at (5, 1) but closer to (1, 1).\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The snake head moves to (5, 2). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid move. This moves closer to the apple at (5, 1).\n\nApples are located at (1, 1), (2, 6), and (5, 1).\nThe closest apple is at (5, 1).\n- Moving LEFT puts the head at (4, 1), one step away from the apple at (5, 1) (by moving DOWN next).\n- Moving DOWN puts the head at (5, 2), one step away from the apple at (5, 1) (by moving LEFT next).\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN moves position the snake to eat the nearest apple in the subsequent turn. Let's choose DOWN to move vertically towards the target apple row.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#AH    #\n#      #\n########\n```\nThe snake's head is at (5, 2) and the current direction is DOWN.\nThere is an apple 'A' at (5, 1) to the left of the snake's head.\nMoving LEFT will allow the snake to eat the apple immediately.\nMoving DOWN would lead to (6, 2), which is empty.\nMoving RIGHT would lead to (5, 3), which is empty.\nMoving UP is not allowed as it's the reverse of DOWN.\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#HS    #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 1) and its body is at (5, 2). The current direction is LEFT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, and LEFT.\n1.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (5, 0), which is a wall ('#'). This leads to collision. Invalid move.\n2.  Move RIGHT: This is the opposite of the current direction (LEFT), so it's an invalid move.\n3.  Move UP: The head would move to (4, 1). This square is empty (' '). Valid move.\n4.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (6, 1). This square is empty (' '). Valid move.\n\nWe need to choose between UP and DOWN.\n- If we move UP, the head will be at (4, 1). The nearest apple is at (1, 1). The path seems open.\n- If we move DOWN, the head will be at (6, 1). The nearest apple is at (6, 4). From (6, 1), the only possible next move is RIGHT (LEFT is wall, DOWN is wall, UP is body if we moved right first, wait - UP is (5,1) which is empty after moving to (6,1)). Let's re-evaluate: After moving DOWN to (6,1), body is at (5,1). Direction is DOWN. Possible moves: LEFT (wall), RIGHT (empty to 6,2), DOWN (wall). Only RIGHT is possible next. This forces a turn and might restrict movement towards the apple at (6,4) or others.\n\nMoving UP to (4, 1) keeps more options open for the subsequent move (UP, RIGHT) and directly heads towards the apple at (1, 1). This seems like a safer and potentially more rewarding strategy.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\n1.  The snake's head 'H' is at (4, 1).\n2.  The snake's body 'S' is at (5, 1).\n3.  The current direction is UP.\n4.  The snake cannot move DOWN because it would be reversing its direction.\n5.  Possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n6.  Moving LEFT would result in hitting the wall '#' at (4, 0).\n7.  Moving RIGHT would move the head to (4, 2), which is an empty space. This is a valid move.\n8.  Moving UP would move the head to (3, 1), which is an empty space. This is a valid move.\n9.  There are apples at (1, 1), (2, 6), and (6, 4).\n10. Moving UP brings the snake closer to the apple at (1, 1). The path UP -> UP -> LEFT would reach this apple in 3 moves.\n11. Moving RIGHT would position the snake to potentially go towards the apples at (2, 6) or (6, 4). The apple at (6, 4) could be reached via RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN -> RIGHT -> RIGHT (5 moves). The apple at (2, 6) is further away.\n12. Choosing UP seems like the most direct path to the nearest apple.\n\nTherefore, moving UP is a safe and strategically sound move.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nMy analysis:\n1.  The snake's head is at (row 3, col 1). The body is at (row 4, col 1).\n2.  The current direction is UP.\n3.  Possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse of the body segment.\n4.  Moving UP: The head moves to (2, 1). This is an empty square. This move is safe and moves towards the apple at (1, 1).\n5.  Moving LEFT: The head moves to (3, 0). This is an empty square. This move is safe but moves away from the nearest apple.\n6.  Moving RIGHT: The head moves to (3, 2). This is an empty square. This move is safe but moves away from the nearest apple.\n\nThe best move is UP, as it is safe and positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (1, 1) in the next step.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#H    A#\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nThe snake head is at (2, 1) and the body is at (3, 1). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: The square at (1, 1) contains an apple ('A'). Moving UP will eat the apple, increase the score, and grow the snake. The new head position will be (1, 1). This is a valid move.\n2.  LEFT: The square at (2, 0) is a wall ('#'). Moving LEFT will result in a collision. This is not a valid move.\n3.  RIGHT: The square at (2, 2) is empty (' '). Moving RIGHT is a valid move. The new head position will be (2, 2).\n4.  DOWN: The current direction is UP, so moving DOWN is reversing direction, which is not allowed.\n\nComparing UP and RIGHT:\n- Moving UP results in eating an apple immediately, increasing the score and length. The snake will then be at (1, 1) facing UP. The next move options would be LEFT (wall) or RIGHT (empty).\n- Moving RIGHT moves the snake to an empty square (2, 2) facing RIGHT. No immediate score increase. The next move options would be UP (empty), RIGHT (empty), or DOWN (empty).\n\nEating the apple is the primary goal. Moving UP achieves this immediately and safely.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#H  A  #\n#S    A#\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 1) (row, col, ignoring borders).

The body segments are at (1, 1) and (2, 1).\nThe possible next moves are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.\n1.  Move RIGHT: The head will move to (1, 3), which is an empty space. This is a valid move. The apple at (1, 4) is one step away.\n2.  Move UP: The head will move to (0, 2), which is a wall '#'. This move leads to game over.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head will move to (2, 2), which is an empty space. This is a valid move. The closest apple is at (1, 4).\n4.  Move LEFT: This is not allowed as it's the reverse of the current direction (RIGHT).\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n- Moving RIGHT takes the snake to (1, 3). This position is safe and moves the snake closer to the apple at (1, 4).\n- Moving DOWN takes the snake to (2, 2). This position is safe but moves the snake further away from the nearest apple at (1, 4).\n\nThe best move is to continue moving RIGHT towards the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#SSHA  #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 4) and is moving RIGHT.\nPossible moves:\n1.  **RIGHT:** Move to (1, 5). This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is good. The snake will become H(1,5), S(1,4), S(1,3). This move is valid.\n2.  **UP:** Move to (0, 4). This square is a wall ('#'). This move leads to collision and game over.\n3.  **DOWN:** Move to (2, 4). This square is empty (' '). This move is valid. The snake will become H(2,4), S(1,4), S(1,3).\n4.  **LEFT:** This move is invalid because the current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction.\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n- Moving RIGHT immediately eats an apple, increases the score, and grows the snake. The position after eating seems safe.\n- Moving DOWN is safe but doesn't eat an apple this turn.\n\nThe best strategy is usually to eat an apple when possible and safe. Moving RIGHT accomplishes this.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#SSSHA #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 5), represented by 'H'.

This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move (not a wall or body part). Eating the apple increases the score and snake length.\n2.  **UP**: Move to (0, 5). This square is a wall ('#'). This move leads to game over.\n3.  **DOWN**: Move to (2, 5). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n4.  **LEFT**: This move is not allowed because it's the reverse of the current direction (RIGHT).\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n- Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. The head will be at (1, 6). The next compulsory move would be DOWN (as UP hits a wall and RIGHT hits a wall) towards the apple at (2, 6). This path seems safe and productive.\n- Moving DOWN moves the snake to an empty square (2, 5). From there, the snake could move RIGHT on the subsequent turn to eat the apple at (2, 6).\n\nMoving RIGHT allows for eating an apple immediately and positions the snake to potentially eat another apple on the next turn. Therefore, moving RIGHT is the best option.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#SSSSH #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 12\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 6) and is currently moving RIGHT.\nIf the snake continues RIGHT, it will hit the wall at (1, 7).\nThe snake cannot move LEFT because it's the reverse of the current direction.\nIf the snake moves UP, it will hit the wall at (0, 6).\nIf the snake moves DOWN, it will move to (2, 6), which contains an apple ('A').

From (1, 6), the only possible next moves are LEFT or RIGHT (cannot move DOWN, reverse). Moving LEFT to (1, 5) hits the snake's body 'S'. Moving RIGHT to (1, 7) hits the wall '#'. Therefore, moving UP now will lead to a game over in the very next step.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The position (3, 6) is empty. This move is safe.

This leads to a collision.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (4, 6). This square is empty ' '. This is a valid and safe move.\n\nTherefore, the only valid move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#   SS #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#     H#\n#A     #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 6). The current direction is DOWN. The snake will move to (5, 6) in the next step.\nWe need to choose the direction for the step *after* reaching (5, 6). The possible inputs are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN (cannot choose UP as it reverses the current direction DOWN).\n\n1.  **If we input RIGHT:** The snake moves DOWN to (5, 6). The next move is RIGHT to (5, 7), which is a wall ('#'). This results in a game over.\n2.  **If we input DOWN:** The snake moves DOWN to (5, 6). The next move is DOWN to (6, 6). This square is empty and safe. From (6, 6), the only safe move is LEFT to (6, 5).\n3.  **If we input LEFT:** The snake moves DOWN to (5, 6). The next move is LEFT to (5, 5). This square is empty and safe. From (5, 5), possible moves are LEFT to (5, 4) or DOWN to (6, 5).\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN inputs avoid immediate collision. Both paths can lead towards the apple at (6, 4).\nChoosing LEFT leads the snake to (5, 5) after the next step, which keeps more movement options open (LEFT or DOWN) compared to choosing DOWN, which leads to (6, 6) and forces a LEFT turn subsequently. Moving towards the center (LEFT) is generally safer than moving towards a corner (DOWN). Therefore, LEFT is the better strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#    S #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#    HS#\n#A     #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 17\n\nAnalysis:\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (4, 4).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake body 'S' occupies positions (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5).\nThe apples 'A' are at positions (5, 1), (6, 1), and (6, 4).\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse of LEFT).\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n1.  Move UP: Head moves to (3, 4). This position is empty. It moves away from the apples.\n2.  Move DOWN: Head moves to (5, 4). This position is empty. This move brings the snake closer to the apple at (6, 4). The next move could be DOWN again to eat this apple.\n3.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (4, 3). This position is empty. This move brings the snake closer to the apples at (5, 1) and (6, 1), but requires more subsequent moves (e.g., DOWN, LEFT, LEFT) to reach the nearest apple at (5,1).\n\nComparing the options, moving DOWN is the most direct path towards eating an apple in the short term (2 moves to eat the apple at (6, 4)). Moving LEFT takes more steps to reach an apple. Moving UP moves away from all apples. Therefore, moving DOWN is the best strategy.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#    SS#\n#A   H #\n#A  A  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 18\n\nAnalyze the possible moves:\n1.  **UP**: Invalid move. The snake is moving DOWN and cannot reverse direction immediately.\n2.  **LEFT**: The snake's head is at (5, 5). Moving LEFT would move the head to (5, 4). This position is currently occupied by a snake body segment ('S'). This move would result in a collision with itself, ending the game.\n3.  **RIGHT**: The snake's head is at (5, 5). Moving RIGHT would move the head to (5, 6). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid move. The snake would not eat an apple.\n4.  **DOWN**: The snake's head is at (5, 5). Moving DOWN would move the head to (6, 5). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid move. The snake would not eat an apple immediately, but it positions the snake adjacent to the apple at (6, 4) for the next potential move (LEFT).\n\nComparing valid moves (RIGHT and DOWN):\n*   Moving RIGHT to (5, 6) leads to a safe position but moves away from the nearest apples.\n*   Moving DOWN to (6, 5) leads to a safe position and sets up an immediate opportunity to eat the apple at (6, 4) by moving LEFT in the next turn.

RIGHT: Reversing direction from LEFT to RIGHT is not allowed. Also, moving to (5, 4) would collide with the snake's body ('S').\n\nComparing the valid moves (LEFT, UP, DOWN):\n- Moving LEFT positions the snake to eat the apple at (5, 1) in the next move.\n- Moving DOWN positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (6, 1) after two more moves (LEFT, LEFT).\n- Moving UP moves away from the closest apples.\n\nMoving LEFT is the most advantageous move as it allows the snake to eat an apple in the next step.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#    SS#\n#AHSSS #\n#A  SS #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nHead position: (4, 1)\nBody positions: {(3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4)}\nApple positions: {(1, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0)}\nCurrent direction is LEFT.\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  Continue LEFT: The snake head moves from (4, 1) to (4, 0). This square contains an apple ('A'). This move is valid (not a wall, not snake body). The snake will eat the apple, grow longer, and the score will increase. The new head position will be (4, 0). The direction remains LEFT.\n2.  Turn UP: The snake head moves from (4, 1) to (3, 1). This square is empty (' '). This move is valid. The new head position will be (3, 1). The direction becomes UP.\n3.  Turn DOWN: The snake head moves from (4, 1) to (5, 1). This square is empty (' '). This move is valid. The new head position will be (5, 1). The direction becomes DOWN.\n4.  Turn RIGHT: This move is invalid because the snake cannot reverse its direction (current direction is LEFT).\n\nEvaluating the moves:\n- LEFT: Eats an apple immediately at (4,0). From the new position (4,0), the snake can move UP to (3,0) (empty) or DOWN to (5,0) (apple). This path secures one apple now and potentially another one immediately after.\n- UP: Moves to an empty square (3,1). This provides open space for maneuvering towards other apples like (1,1) or the ones near the left wall. It's a safe move but delays eating an apple.\n- DOWN: Moves to an empty square (5,1). From (5,1), the snake can turn LEFT on the next move to eat the apple at (5,0). This also delays the immediate apple but sets up for it next turn.\n\nComparing the options, moving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, increasing the score and snake length. The position after eating the apple appears safe, with valid subsequent moves available, including one towards another apple. Therefore, moving LEFT is the most advantageous move according to the goal of maximizing apple consumption.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#    SS#\n#HSSSS #\n#A  SS #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1.  **UP**: The snake's head is at (5, 1). Moving UP moves the head to (4, 1). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. The snake will not collide with walls or itself.\n2.  **DOWN**: Moving DOWN moves the head to (6, 1). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move. The snake will eat the apple, grow longer, and the score will increase.\n3.  **LEFT**: The snake's head is at (5, 1). Moving LEFT would move the head to (5, 0), which is a wall ('#'). This leads to a collision. Invalid move.\n4.  **RIGHT**: The current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction directly from LEFT to RIGHT. Invalid move.\n\nWe have two valid moves: UP and DOWN.\n\nLet's evaluate the consequences:\n*   **If we move UP**: The head moves to (4, 1). The board becomes:\n    ```\n    ########\n    #    A #\n    #A     #\n    #      #\n    #H   SS#\n    # SSSS #\n    #A  SS #\n    ########\n    ```\n    The new direction is UP. From (4, 1), the snake can move UP to (3, 1) or RIGHT to (4, 2). This path keeps options open towards the apples at (2, 1) and (1, 5).\n\n*   **If we move DOWN**: The head moves to (6, 1) and eats the apple. The snake grows. The board becomes (approximately, showing head and new body segment):\n    ```\n    ########\n    #    A #\n    #A     #\n    #      #\n    #    SS#\n    # SSSSS#  <-- (5,1) becomes S\n    #HA SS #  <-- (6,1) is H, apple eaten\n    ########\n    ```\n    The new direction is DOWN. From (6, 1), the only possible move is RIGHT to (6, 2) (LEFT and DOWN are walls).\n    After moving RIGHT, the head is at (6, 2), direction RIGHT.

All moves lead to collision.\n\nMoving DOWN leads to eating an apple but results in a guaranteed collision shortly after.

This move is safe.\n\nNow compare the safe moves: RIGHT and UP.\n\n*   Moving UP to (3, 1) positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (2, 1) in the next move by moving UP again.\n*   Moving RIGHT to (4, 2) moves the snake away from the closest apple at (2, 1). It doesn't immediately lead towards any apple and might complicate reaching the apple at (6, 1) given the body's position.\n\nThe best strategy is usually to move towards the nearest reachable apple while ensuring safety.

This is an invalid move (collision).\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (3, 2). This square is empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n- Moving UP allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, increasing the score and length. The position (2, 1) is safe from walls and the snake's body.\n- Moving RIGHT is safe but does not result in eating an apple this turn.\n\nThe optimal strategy is usually to prioritize eating apples when it's safe to do so. Moving UP achieves this.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#    A #\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SSSSS #\n#A ASS #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 27\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 1). The current direction is UP.\nThe possible next moves are:\n1.  **UP**: Move to (1, 1). This square is empty (' '). It is not a wall ('#') or the snake's body ('S'). This move is allowed as it's not the reverse of the current direction (DOWN).\n2.  **DOWN**: Move to (3, 1). This square contains the snake's body ('S'). Also, this move is prohibited because it's the reverse of the current direction (UP).\n3.  **LEFT**: Move to (2, 0). This square is a wall ('#'). This move leads to a game over.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Move to (2, 2). This square is empty (' '). It is not a wall ('#') or the snake's body ('S'). This move is allowed.\n\nWe need to choose between UP and RIGHT.\nThere are three apples 'A' at positions (1, 5), (6, 1), and (6, 3).\n\nLet's analyze the moves:\n-   **Move UP:** The head moves to (1, 1). The snake is now moving UP. From (1, 1), the only viable moves are RIGHT (to 1, 2) because UP and LEFT hit walls. This path leads directly towards the apple at (1, 5) via moves RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. This seems like a safe and efficient path to the nearest apple.\n-   **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (2, 2). The snake is now moving RIGHT. From (2, 2), the snake can move UP (to 1, 2), DOWN (to 3, 2), or RIGHT (to 2, 3). Moving UP from here also leads towards the apple at (1, 5). Moving DOWN or RIGHT leads towards the lower part of the board where the other apples are, but also where most of the snake's body is located, making it potentially riskier to navigate.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe immediate moves. Moving UP forces the snake along the top row towards the apple at (1, 5), which is the closest apple. Moving RIGHT keeps more options open for the next step but the path towards the lower apples seems complicated and risky. Targeting the nearest apple at (1, 5) via the UP move seems the most straightforward strategy.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#H   A #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SSSS  #\n#A ASS #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 28\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (1, 1).\nThe current direction is UP.\nPossible moves:\n1.

Continue RIGHT: Move to (1, 5). This square contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move, doesn't hit a wall or the snake's body 'S'. Eating the apple increases the score and snake length.\n2.  Change direction to DOWN: Move to (2, 4). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n3.  Change direction to UP: Move to (0, 4). This square is a wall '#'. This move leads to game over.\n4.  Change direction to LEFT: This is not allowed because the snake is currently moving RIGHT (cannot reverse direction).\n\nComparing valid moves:\n- Moving RIGHT eats an apple immediately, which is the objective. The snake head will be at (1, 5), and the direction remains RIGHT. The only valid move from (1, 5) heading RIGHT would be DOWN to (2, 5) to avoid the wall at (1, 6). This path seems safe for the subsequent step.\n- Moving DOWN moves to an empty square (2, 4). This keeps the snake alive but doesn't score points immediately.\n\nEating the apple is preferable.

Check move DOWN: The position below the head is (2, 6), which is an empty space ' '. This move is valid and safe.\n\nSince moving RIGHT or UP leads to collision, and moving LEFT is not allowed, the only possible and safe move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S   H #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SS A  #\n#A A   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 33\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\nThe snake's head is at (2, 5).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (2, 6), which is a wall ('#'). This leads to game over.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (3, 5). This square is empty. This move is safe.\n3.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (2, 4). This square is empty. This move is safe.\n\nNow compare the safe moves, LEFT and DOWN.\nThe apples are at (5, 4), (6, 1), and (6, 3). The nearest apple is at (5, 4).\n- If I move DOWN, the head will be at (3, 5). The next move towards (5, 4) would likely be LEFT to (3, 4).\n- If I move LEFT, the head will be at (2, 4). The next move towards (5, 4) would likely be DOWN to (3, 4).\n\nBoth moves position the snake to move towards the apple at (5, 4) in the subsequent step. Moving LEFT places the head directly above the column of the nearest apple and also moves the snake slightly more towards the center and the other apples on the left side of the board. Moving DOWN keeps the snake closer to the right wall. Moving LEFT seems slightly more advantageous for accessing the whole board and future apples.\n\nTherefore, I choose LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S  HS #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S  A  #\n#A A   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 34\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 4).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so moving RIGHT is not allowed.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n1.

Move LEFT: The square at (2, 3) is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n\nWe need to choose between DOWN and LEFT.\n- Moving DOWN places the head at (3, 4). This moves the snake towards the lower part of the board where the apples are located at (5, 4), (6, 1), and (6, 3).\n- Moving LEFT places the head at (2, 3). This keeps the snake higher up but is also a safe move.\n\nStrategically, moving towards the apples is generally preferred. Moving DOWN achieves this more directly than moving LEFT. Both moves are safe from immediate collision. Therefore, moving DOWN is a reasonable choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S  SS #\n#S  H  #\n#S     #\n#   A  #\n#A A   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 35\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 4). The current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** Head moves to (3, 3). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. It moves away from the apple at (5, 4).\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** Head moves to (3, 5). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. It moves away from the apple at (5, 4).\n3.  **Move DOWN:** Head moves to (4, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. This move positions the snake's head one step closer to the apple at (5, 4). In the next step, moving DOWN again would eat the apple.\n\nMoving DOWN is the most strategic move as it directly progresses towards the nearest apple at (5, 4) without immediate danger of collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S  SS #\n#S  S  #\n#   H  #\n#   A  #\n#A A   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 36\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (4, 4).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so moving UP is not allowed.\nThe possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  Move DOWN: The head moves to (5, 4). This square contains an apple 'A'. The snake eats the apple, increases its length and score. This move is safe (no collision with walls or body). This is a beneficial move.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (4, 3). This square is empty. The move is safe. The snake doesn't eat an apple.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (4, 5). This square is empty. The move is safe. The snake doesn't eat an apple.\n\nComparing the options, moving DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the score. The position after eating the apple also seems safe with multiple subsequent move options. Therefore, moving DOWN is the best move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n```\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S  SS #\n#S  S  #\n#   S  #\n# A H  #\n#A A   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 37\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (5, 5).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. UP is not allowed because it's the reverse of DOWN.\n\n1.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (5, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (5, 6). This square is a wall ('#'). This leads to a collision and game over. Invalid move.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head moves to (6, 5). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nWe have two valid moves: LEFT and DOWN.\n\nLet's evaluate the consequences:\n- If we move LEFT to (5, 4): The snake head will be at (5, 4). The direction will be LEFT. From here, the snake can move UP (to 4, 4 - body collision!), DOWN (to 6, 4 - empty), or LEFT (to 5, 3 - empty). Moving DOWN or LEFT seems safe and allows paths towards the apples at (6,1), (6,3), or (5,1).\n- If we move DOWN to (6, 5): The snake head will be at (6, 5). The direction will be DOWN. From here, the snake can move LEFT (to 6, 4 - empty) or RIGHT (to 6, 6 - wall collision!). The only safe subsequent move is LEFT. This path also leads towards the apples at (6,1) and (6,3).\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are safe moves and can lead to apples. Moving LEFT keeps more options open for the next turn (DOWN or LEFT), while moving DOWN forces a LEFT turn immediately after. Generally, keeping options open is a good strategy in Snake. Therefore, LEFT is a slightly preferable move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S  SS #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n# AHS  #\n#A A   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 38\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 3).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** New head position (4, 3). This is an empty space ' ', so it's a valid move.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** New head position (6, 3). This square contains an apple 'A'. Eating the apple is good, but this position is close to the bottom wall. Let's check the next moves from (6, 3) with direction DOWN: Must turn LEFT or RIGHT. Turning LEFT to (6, 2) is possible. Turning RIGHT to (6, 4) is possible. Turning DOWN hits the wall. After eating the apple at (6,3) and moving LEFT to (6,2), the next move could be LEFT to (6,1) to eat another apple. From (6,1), the only way out is UP to (5,1), trapping the snake against the left wall and its body. So, DOWN seems risky long-term.\n3.  **Move LEFT:** New head position (5, 2). This is an empty space ' ', so it's a valid move. This move positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (5, 1) in the next step by moving LEFT again. This path seems safer and keeps more options open.\n\nComparing the options, moving LEFT seems the safest and most strategic move, as it avoids immediate traps and positions the snake to eat an apple soon.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S  SS #\n#   S  #\n# A S  #\n# HSS  #\n#A A   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 1). The current direction is LEFT.\nPossible moves:\n1.  Continue LEFT: Move to (5, 0). This is a wall '#'. Collision. Game Over.\n2.  Turn UP: Move to (4, 1). This square contains an apple 'A'. This move is safe (not a wall or snake body).\n3.  Turn DOWN: Move to (6, 1). This square contains an apple 'A'. This move is safe (not a wall or snake body).\n4.  Turn RIGHT: This is the opposite of the current direction (LEFT), so it's an invalid move.\n\nBoth UP and DOWN lead to eating an apple safely. Let's consider the situation after each move:\n- If I move UP: The head will be at (4, 1). The snake can then move UP to (3, 1) or RIGHT to (4, 2). There is open space.\n- If I move DOWN: The head will be at (6, 1). The snake can then only move RIGHT to (6, 2) (DOWN and LEFT hit walls). From (6, 2), the only safe move is RIGHT to (6, 3) to eat the other apple. This path seems more restrictive.\n\nMoving UP offers more options immediately after eating the apple. Therefore, UP is the preferred move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S  SS #\n#   S  #\n# H S  #\n# SSS  #\n#A AA  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 40\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 2) (row 4, column 2, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe current direction is UP. The snake cannot move DOWN.\nThe possible moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n1.  Check move UP: The position (3, 2) is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  Check move LEFT: The position (4, 1) is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  Check move RIGHT: The position (4, 3) contains a snake body part ('S'). This is an invalid move (collision).\n\nThe valid moves are UP and LEFT.\nNow, let's evaluate the consequences of these moves:\n\n-   If we move UP to (3, 2): The snake head will be at (3, 2). The surrounding cells are (2, 2) empty, (3, 1) empty, (3, 3) empty. This move leads to an open area with multiple subsequent move options (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).\n-   If we move LEFT to (4, 1): The snake head will be at (4, 1). The surrounding cells are (3, 1) empty, (4, 0) wall '#', (5, 1) snake body 'S'. This move leads to a position where the next immediate moves are restricted: UP to (3,1) is possible, LEFT hits a wall, DOWN hits the snake body (assuming 'S' at (5,1) is not the tail, which is unknown). This path seems more constrained.\n\nAlthough the apples are downwards (row 6), the path downwards seems blocked or risky due to the snake's own body. Moving UP opens up more space for maneuvering, which is generally safer, especially when the snake is long and the board is relatively small. Survival is the priority. Therefore, moving UP is the safer strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n```\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#   SS #\n# H S  #\n# S S  #\n# SSS  #\n#A AA  #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 41\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 2) (row 3, column 2, using 0-based indexing from the top-left corner).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reversing direction).\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (2, 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (3, 1). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (3, 3). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n-   **UP (to 2, 2):** Moves the snake into the upper part of the board where the body is densely packed. While immediately safe, subsequent moves might be restricted (e.g., LEFT to (2,1), RIGHT to (2,3), UP to (1,2) - collision).\n-   **LEFT (to 3, 1):** Moves the snake towards the left wall, but opens a path downwards towards the apple at (6, 1). From (3, 1), the snake can potentially move DOWN -> DOWN -> DOWN to reach the apple. This seems like a good path towards food.\n-   **RIGHT (to 3, 3):** Moves the snake into a pocket. The square below (4, 3) is empty, but the square to the right (3, 4) is body ('S') and the square below right (4, 4) is also body ('S'). Moving DOWN from (3, 3) to (4, 3) might lead to getting trapped quickly as the path to the apples at (6, 3) and (6, 4) is blocked by the snake's body at (5, 3) and (5, 4).\n\nComparing the options, moving LEFT provides the clearest path towards an apple while avoiding immediate danger and densely packed body parts.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n########\n# SSSS #\n#   SS #\n#HS S  #\n# S S  #\n# SSS  #\n#A AA  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (row=3, col=1).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\n1.

This is a valid move.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (4, 1). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nLet's evaluate the valid moves:\n- If moving UP: The head goes to (2, 1). The path towards the apples at the bottom seems blocked by the snake's body. Future moves might be restricted.\n- If moving DOWN: The head goes to (4, 1). This moves the snake closer to the bottom row where the apples are. From (4, 1) moving DOWN again leads to (5, 1) (empty), and then moving DOWN again leads to (6, 1) which contains an apple 'A'. This seems like a promising path to an apple.\n\nChoosing DOWN appears to be the better immediate strategy to reach an apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#  SSS #\n#   SS #\n#SS S  #\n#HS S  #\n# SSS  #\n#A AA  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 43\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 1).

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#SS SSS#\n#SSSHSS#\n#S SSS #\n#S    A#\n#S    A#\n# A    #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 48\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"RIGHT","response":["Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 1\n\nMy goal is to move towards the apples ('A') while avoiding walls ('#') and myself (currently only 'H').\nThe current direction is UP.

This seems like the best strategic move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 2). The current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot move RIGHT.\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n- Moving LEFT: The head moves to (4, 1), which is empty. This is a safe move.\n- Moving UP: The head moves to (3, 2), which is empty. This is a safe move but moves away from the apples.\n- Moving DOWN: The head moves to (5, 2), which contains an apple ('A'). This is a safe move, and the snake will eat the apple and grow.\n\nEating an apple increases the score, which is the goal. Therefore, moving DOWN is the best move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S A  #\n#AH    #\n#A     #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nThe snake head is at (5, 2) and the body is at (4, 2). The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN. Moving UP is not allowed as it reverses the current direction.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (5, 1). This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score and the snake's length. This is a valid and beneficial move.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (5, 3). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head moves to (6, 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nTo maximize the score, eating the apple is the best immediate action. Moving LEFT achieves this.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S A  #\n#HS   A#\n#A     #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 1), and its body segments are at (5, 2) and (4, 2).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot continue LEFT, as it would hit the wall at (5, 0).\nThe snake cannot turn RIGHT, as that is the reverse of its current direction.\nThe possible moves are UP and DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move UP:**\n    -   The head would move to (4, 1). This square is empty.\n    -   The new snake position would be Head: (4, 1), Body: (5, 1), (5, 2).\n    -   This is a valid move. No apple is eaten. The new direction would be UP.\n\n2.  **Move DOWN:**\n    -   The head would move to (6, 1). This square contains an apple ('A').\n    -   The snake eats the apple, the score increases, and the snake grows.\n    -   The new snake position would be Head: (6, 1), Body: (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2).\n    -   This is a valid move. An apple is eaten. The new direction would be DOWN.\n\nComparing the two moves:\n- Moving UP is safe but doesn't yield an immediate score increase.\n- Moving DOWN results in eating an apple, increasing the score and snake length. Let's check the safety after moving DOWN. The snake would be H=(6,1), S=(5,1), S=(5,2), S=(4,2). From (6,1), moving DOWN, the next possible moves are LEFT (wall), RIGHT (empty space at 6,2), DOWN (wall). The only valid move after moving DOWN would be RIGHT, which is safe.\n\nEating an apple is the primary goal besides survival. Since moving DOWN allows eating an apple and does not lead to an immediate game over, it is the preferred move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S A  #\n#SS   A#\n#H     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head is at row 6, column 1.\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (UP is reversing direction).\n- If I choose LEFT, the snake head moves to (6, 0), which is a wall '#'.

The body segments are at (6, 3), (6, 2), and (5, 1). The current direction is RIGHT. Apples are at (1, 4), (4, 3), and (5, 6).\nThe snake cannot move LEFT because it's the reverse of the current direction.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (5, 4). This square is empty and not a wall. This move is safe.\n2.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (7, 4). This square contains a wall ('#'). This move leads to collision and game over.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (6, 5). This square is empty and not a wall. This move is safe.\n\nComparing safe moves UP and RIGHT:\n- Moving UP to (5, 4) puts the snake closer to the apples at (4, 3) and (5, 6) (Manhattan distance 2 to both).\n- Moving RIGHT to (6, 5) puts the snake closer to the apple at (5, 6) (Manhattan distance 2) but further from the apple at (4, 3) (Manhattan distance 4).\n\nMoving UP places the snake in a more central position (5, 4) compared to moving RIGHT which places it at (6, 5), closer to the right wall. Moving UP provides better access to the apples at (4, 3) and potentially (1, 4) later. Therefore, UP seems the better strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#  H  A#\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nBased on the current board state:\n1.  The snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 3).\n2.  The snake's body 'S' occupies (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\n3.  Apples 'A' are at (1, 4), (4, 4), and (5, 6).\n4.  The current direction is UP. Allowed moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is illegal.\n5.  Moving LEFT: Head goes to (5, 2). Safe, but moves away from nearby apples.\n6.  Moving RIGHT: Head goes to (5, 4). Safe. Puts the snake in position to potentially move UP to eat the apple at (4, 4) or continue RIGHT towards the apple at (5, 6).\n7.  Moving UP: Head goes to (4, 3). Safe. Puts the snake in position to move RIGHT to eat the apple at (4, 4).\n\nComparing UP and RIGHT:\n- Moving UP to (4, 3) allows a subsequent move RIGHT to eat the apple at (4, 4). This apple is 2 steps away (UP, RIGHT).\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 4) allows a subsequent move UP to eat the apple at (4, 4). This apple is 2 steps away (RIGHT, UP).\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 4) also allows subsequent moves RIGHT towards the apple at (5, 6), which is 3 steps away (RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT).\n\nThe apple at (4, 4) is the closest reachable apple. Both UP and RIGHT are valid first steps towards it. Let's analyze the board state after eating the apple via each path:\n- Path UP -> RIGHT: Eat at (4, 4). Head=(4, 4), Body=(4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3). Direction=RIGHT. The next immediate move LEFT is blocked by the body. Moves UP (3, 4) and RIGHT (4, 5) are open. Seems relatively safe.\n- Path RIGHT -> UP: Eat at (4, 4). Head=(4, 4), Body=(5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3). Direction=UP. The next immediate move LEFT (4, 3) is blocked by the body. Moves UP (3, 4) and RIGHT (4, 5) are open. Seems relatively safe.\n\nBoth initial moves UP and RIGHT seem viable for reaching the nearest apple quickly and safely. Choosing UP slightly prioritizes moving towards the upper part of the board where another apple (1, 4) resides.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#  S  A#\n# SS   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 9\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 3). The current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP**: The head moves to (3, 3). This square is empty. It's a valid move.\n2.  **Move LEFT**: The head moves to (4, 2). This square is empty. It's a valid move.\n3.  **Move RIGHT**: The head moves to (4, 4). This square is empty. It's a valid move.\n\nAll three moves are safe from immediate collision. Now, let's consider the apple positions: (1, 5), (4, 5), and (5, 6).\nThe closest apple is at (4, 5). To reach this apple, the snake needs to move RIGHT. Moving RIGHT brings the head to (4, 4), one step closer to the apple at (4, 5). The next move after that could be RIGHT again to eat the apple.\nMoving UP or LEFT would move the snake away from the nearest apple. Therefore, moving RIGHT is the best strategic move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#  S  A#\n# SS   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 10\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 4). The current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT. LEFT is invalid (reverse direction).\n- Moving UP leads to (3, 4), which is empty.\n- Moving DOWN leads to (5, 4), which is empty.\n- Moving RIGHT leads to (4, 5), which is empty.\n\nThere are apples at (1, 1), (1, 5), and (5, 6). The closest apple is at (5, 6).\nTo reach the apple at (5, 6):\n- Option 1: Go DOWN to (5, 4), then RIGHT to (5, 5), then RIGHT to (5, 6). This path is clear.\n- Option 2: Go RIGHT to (4, 5), then DOWN to (5, 5), then RIGHT to (5, 6). This path is also clear.\n\nBoth moves, DOWN and RIGHT, position the snake to easily reach the nearest apple at (5, 6). Moving DOWN seems slightly more direct towards the row of the target apple. Let's choose DOWN.\n\nMove DOWN: The head moves from (4, 4) to (5, 4). The square (5, 4) is empty and not a wall. This is a safe move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#  SH A#\n#  S   #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 4).\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies positions (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), and (6, 3).\nApples 'A' are at positions (1, 1), (1, 5), and (5, 6).\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN.\n\nPossible next moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN. The snake cannot move UP because it's the reverse of the current direction (DOWN).\n\n1.  **Check move LEFT:** The head would move to (5, 3). This position is currently occupied by a snake body part 'S'. Moving LEFT would result in a collision and game over.\n2.  **Check move RIGHT:** The head would move to (5, 5). This position is empty. This is a safe move. The apple at (5, 6) is one step away after this move.\n3.  **Check move DOWN:** The head would move to (6, 4). This position is empty. This is a safe move. After this move, the only safe subsequent move would be RIGHT towards the apple at (5, 6).\n\nComparing RIGHT and DOWN:\n- Moving RIGHT places the head at (5, 5). The next move can be RIGHT to eat the apple at (5, 6).\n- Moving DOWN places the head at (6, 4). The next move would likely be RIGHT to (6, 5), and then RIGHT again to eat the apple (now at 6, 6).\n\nMoving RIGHT allows eating the apple at (5, 6) in the next step (epoch 12 -> move RIGHT, epoch 13 -> move RIGHT, eat apple).\nMoving DOWN requires two more steps to eat the apple (epoch 12 -> move DOWN, epoch 13 -> move RIGHT, epoch 14 -> move RIGHT, eat apple).\n\nMoving RIGHT seems more efficient to get the nearest apple and offers good positioning afterwards.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#  SSHA#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 12\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT.

Eating the apple increases the score and the snake's length. It's a valid and beneficial move.\n\nComparing the options, moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which aligns with the game's objective.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#A SSSH#\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 13\n\nMy analysis:\n1.  The snake's head is at (5, 6).\n2.  The current direction is RIGHT.\n3.  The possible next moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT (cannot move LEFT, as it's the reverse direction).\n4.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (5, 7), which is a wall ('#'). This leads to collision and game over.\n5.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (6, 6). This square is empty and safe for now. The next position would be (6, 6).\n6.  Move UP: The head would move to (4, 6). This square is empty and safe for now. The next position would be (4, 6).\n7.  Compare UP and DOWN:\n    *   Moving UP brings the snake closer to the apple at (1, 5). The path UP -> UP -> UP -> UP -> LEFT reaches the apple.\n    *   Moving DOWN moves the snake away from all apples. If the snake moves DOWN to (6, 6), the only subsequent safe move is LEFT to (6, 5). From (6, 5), the only safe move is UP to (5, 5), which is a body part, causing a collision. Therefore, moving DOWN leads to a trap.\n8.  Based on the analysis, moving UP is the safest and most beneficial move as it avoids immediate collision and moves towards an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SS H#\n#A  SSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 14\n\nThe current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- Moving UP leads to (3, 6), which is empty.

The next move could be UP to eat the apple at (1, 5).\n\nBoth moves UP and LEFT are safe and allow the snake to reach the nearest apple in the subsequent step.

All are to the left side of the board relative to the snake's head.\n\n- If we move LEFT, the head goes to (1, 4). This moves the head directly towards the apple at (1, 2). The path to reach it would be LEFT, LEFT. This seems like a direct path to the closest apple.\n- If we move DOWN, the head goes to (2, 5). From here, the snake would likely need to turn LEFT to approach the apples.\n\nMoving LEFT seems the most direct approach towards the nearest apple at (1, 2). It also keeps the snake in the upper part of the board initially, potentially leaving more maneuvering space below. Let's verify the path after moving LEFT: Head(1,4) -> LEFT -> Head(1,3) -> LEFT -> Head(1,2) (Eat Apple 1).

This is a safe move, eats an apple, increases the score, and grows the snake.\n\nEating the apple is beneficial. Therefore, moving LEFT is the best option.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n# HSSSS#\n#     S#\n# A   S#\n#   A S#\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 21\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 1).

LEFT: Moves to (1, 0), which is a wall '#'. Invalid move.\n4.  RIGHT: Reversing direction from LEFT to RIGHT is not allowed. Invalid move.\n\nThe only valid move is DOWN. Moving DOWN avoids collision with walls and the snake's body.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# H   S#\n# A   S#\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake's head is at row 2, column 1 (0-indexed inside the walls).\nThe squares adjacent to the head are:\n- UP: (1, 1) - Contains 'S' (body). Cannot move UP because the current direction is DOWN.\n- DOWN: (3, 1) - Contains 'A' (apple). Valid move.\n- LEFT: (2, 0) - Empty space. Valid move.\n- RIGHT: (2, 2) - Empty space. Valid move.\n\nMoving DOWN will result in eating the apple at (3, 1), increasing the score and snake length. This seems like a good move as it achieves the objective of eating apples and is not an immediate collision.\nMoving LEFT or RIGHT is also safe but does not immediately result in eating an apple.\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# S   S#\n# H   S#\n#A  A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 23\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 1).

This position contains a wall '#'. This move leads to a collision and game over.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The snake's head would move to (3, 2). This position is empty '.'. This is a safe move.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The snake's head would move to (4, 1). This position contains an apple 'A'. This is a safe move, and the snake will eat the apple, grow longer, and the score will increase.\n\nMoving DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which aligns with the game's objective. Moving RIGHT is safe but delays eating an apple. Therefore, moving DOWN is the better move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# S   S#\n# S    #\n#AH A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 2) (row 4, column 2, inside the walls, 0-indexed).\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies the squares: (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6).\nApples 'A' are at positions: (4, 0), (4, 4), (5, 0).\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so moving UP is forbidden.\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  **DOWN**: Move head to (5, 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. It moves towards the apple at (5, 0).\n2.  **LEFT**: Move head to (4, 1). This square is occupied by the snake's body 'S'. This is an invalid move (collision).\n3.  **RIGHT**: Move head to (4, 3). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. It moves towards the apple at (4, 4).\n\nComparing valid moves DOWN and RIGHT:\n- Moving RIGHT places the head at (4, 3). The next move RIGHT would eat the apple at (4, 4). This path seems safe and leads to an immediate apple.\n- Moving DOWN places the head at (5, 2). Subsequent moves LEFT, LEFT would eat the apple at (5, 0). However, further analysis suggests this path leads the snake into a potentially trapped position near the left wall after eating subsequent apples.\n\nMoving RIGHT is the safer option that allows access to an apple quickly while maintaining maneuverability.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# S    #\n# S    #\n#ASHA  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 25\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 4).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot move LEFT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n1.

Move RIGHT: Head moves to (4, 5). This is an apple 'A'. This is a valid move. Eating the apple increases the score and length.\n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. Let's check if moving RIGHT leads to an immediate trap.\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, the new head position will be (4, 5). The current tail is at (1, 6).

Neither move results in collision.\n\nMoving UP leads to (3, 4). No immediate apple.\nMoving DOWN leads to (5, 4). No immediate apple, but closer to the apple at (5, 1).\n\nSince eating an apple is the primary goal and moving RIGHT achieves this without immediate danger, RIGHT is the best move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n```\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# S    #\n# S    #\n#ASSH  #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 26\n\nBased on the current board state and direction:\n- The snake's head is at (row 4, col 5).\n- The current direction is RIGHT.\n- Possible moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT (LEFT is invalid as it's the reverse direction).\n- Moving RIGHT (to 4, 6) would hit the wall '#'.\n- Moving UP (to 3, 5) is safe, the square is empty.\n- Moving DOWN (to 5, 5) is safe, the square is empty.\n\nComparing UP and DOWN:\n- Moving UP leads to an open area but away from the apples.\n- Moving DOWN also leads to an open area, and positions the snake to potentially move LEFT on the next turn to eat the apple at (5, 4).\n\nMoving DOWN is a safe move that positions the snake closer to an apple for the next turn.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# S    #\n#AS    #\n#ASSS  #\n#A  H  #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 27\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 4).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP (reversing direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n1.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (5, 3). This square is occupied by the snake's body 'S'. This would cause a collision, ending the game.\n2.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (5, 5). This square is empty. This is a safe move. From (5, 5) going RIGHT, the only safe next move is DOWN to (6, 5). From (6, 5) going DOWN, the only safe move is LEFT to (6, 4).

From (6, 4) going DOWN, the possible safe moves are LEFT to (6, 3) or RIGHT to (6, 5). Moving LEFT from (6, 4) opens a path towards the apples located at (3, 1), (4, 1), and (5, 1). Specifically, a sequence like DOWN -> LEFT -> LEFT -> LEFT -> UP would lead to eating the apple at (5, 1).\n\nComparing RIGHT and DOWN, moving DOWN provides a clearer path towards the cluster of apples on the left side of the board while maintaining space to maneuver. Moving RIGHT leads into a corner with limited options quickly. Therefore, DOWN is the better strategic move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n```\n########\n# SSSS #\n# S    #\n#AS    #\n#ASSS  #\n#A  S  #\n#   H  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 28\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at row 6, column 4.\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP because it's the reverse direction.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n1.

Check move RIGHT: The position to the right of the head (row 6, column 5) is empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n\nComparing LEFT and RIGHT:\n- Moving LEFT positions the snake closer to the cluster of apples ('A') on the left side of the board.\n- Moving RIGHT moves the snake away from the apples and towards the right wall. In the next step, moving UP from (6,5) would lead to collision with the snake's body 'S' at (5,5), and moving RIGHT leads towards the wall.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is the strategically better and safer move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n# SSS  #\n# S    #\n#AS    #\n#ASSS  #\n#A  S  #\n#  HS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 29\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 2).

This is a valid move.\nMoving UP would move the head to (5, 2), which is empty. This is a valid move.\n\nLet's evaluate the valid moves:\n1.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (6, 1). The snake can then move UP to eat the apple at (5, 1).\n2.  Move UP: Head moves to (5, 2). The snake can then move LEFT to eat the apple at (5, 1).\n\nBoth moves allow the snake to eat the apple at (5, 1) in the next step. Moving UP places the head at (5, 2), which is slightly further away from the bottom wall compared to moving LEFT, which places the head at (6, 1) next to the left wall. Keeping some distance from walls is generally preferable. Therefore, moving UP is a slightly better strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n# SS   #\n# S    #\n#AS    #\n#ASSS  #\n#A HS  #\n#  SS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 30\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at row 5, column 3.\nThe current direction is UP.\nIf the snake continues UP, it will move to (4, 3), which is occupied by its body 'S'. This will cause a collision and end the game.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN because that would be reversing its current direction (UP).\nThe snake can potentially move LEFT or RIGHT.\nIf the snake moves LEFT, it will move to (5, 2), which is empty space. This is a valid move.\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, it will move to (5, 4), which is occupied by its body 'S'. This will cause a collision and end the game.\nTherefore, the only valid move to avoid immediate collision is LEFT. Moving LEFT also positions the snake towards the apples on the left side.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n# S    #\n# S    #\n#AS    #\n#ASSS  #\n#AHSS  #\n#  SS  #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at coordinates (5, 2) (row 5, column 2, assuming 0-based indexing from the top-left corner, excluding walls). The snake's body ('S') occupies the squares: (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3). There are apples ('A') at (3, 1), (4, 1), and (5, 1). The current direction is LEFT.\n\nThe possible moves are UP, DOWN, and LEFT. Moving RIGHT is not allowed because it's the reverse of the current direction.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (4, 2). This square is empty (' '). This move is safe (no collision with walls or self). It does not eat an apple.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (6, 2). This square is empty (' '). This move is safe (no collision with walls or self). It does not eat an apple.\n3.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (5, 1). This square contains an apple ('A'). This move is safe (no collision with walls or self) and eats an apple, increasing the score and snake length.\n\nSince the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, moving LEFT to eat the apple at (5, 1) is the best immediate action. It leads directly to scoring a point and growing the snake, and subsequent moves appear safe and allow access to other apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n# S    #\n# SA   #\n#AS    #\n#ASSS  #\n#HSSS  #\n#  SS  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 32\n\nMy analysis of the possible moves:\n1.  **LEFT**: The snake's head (H) is at row 5, column 0 (inside the walls). Moving LEFT would hit the wall ('#') at row 5, column -1. This leads to game over.\n2.  **UP**: Moving UP would place the head at row 4, column 0. This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move. The snake will eat the apple, grow longer, and the score will increase.\n3.  **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would place the head at row 6, column 0. This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n4.  **RIGHT**: The current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction directly, so moving RIGHT is not allowed.\n\nComparing the valid moves (UP and DOWN):\n- Moving UP allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. This increases the score and is generally the objective of the game. The next position after UP would be (4,0), and the snake's direction would become UP. From (4,0), moving UP again leads to another apple at (3,0).\n- Moving DOWN leads the snake to an empty square (6,0). The direction becomes DOWN. From (6,0), the only possible move is RIGHT to (6,1) because UP hits the new body part at (5,0), DOWN hits the wall, and LEFT hits the wall. This path seems less promising than eating the apple.\n\nEating the apple by moving UP is the better immediate strategy.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n# S    #\n# SA   #\n#AS    #\n#HSSS A#\n#SSSS  #\n#  SS  #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe current position of the snake head 'H' is at row 4, column 1.\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (cannot move DOWN as it's the reverse direction).\n\n1.  **Check move UP:** The square above the head is at row 3, column 1.

The next move could be DOWN to eat the apple at (3, 5). This also seems like a good path towards an apple.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT moves position the snake to eat the apple at (3, 5) in the subsequent step. Let's consider the position after moving DOWN. The head is at (3, 4), and the next move would likely be RIGHT to (3, 5). After eating the apple, the snake grows, and the path seems open towards the apple at (4, 6) by moving RIGHT again or DOWN.

While safe initially, subsequent moves (e.g., UP again, then LEFT) can lead to collisions with the snake's body quickly ((1,3) is blocked by S at (1,2) and S at(2,3)). Going UP then RIGHT eventually leads towards the apples but seems to result in a trap later.\n-   **DOWN:** Moves the snake towards (4,4). From here, moving RIGHT leads towards the apples at (3,6) and (4,6). Moving LEFT leads towards the apple at (6,1) but seems to result in a trap quickly (collision at (3,2) or (4,1)). Moving DOWN -> RIGHT -> RIGHT (eat A) -> UP (eat A) seems like a viable path to eat two apples, but simulation shows it leads to a trap later.\n-   **RIGHT:** Moves the snake towards (3,5). From here, moving RIGHT again leads to the apple at (3,6). This is the most direct path to the nearest apple. Eating this apple, then moving DOWN to eat the apple at (4,6) is possible. Simulation of this path also shows it leads to a trap later on, but it allows eating two apples first and survives for a reasonable number of steps compared to other paths.\n\nComparing the options, moving RIGHT immediately sets up eating the apple at (3,6) on the next turn. This seems like the most promising short-term strategy, despite the high likelihood of getting trapped later due to the snake's length and board configuration.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#SS    #\n#SSS  A#\n#S SSH #\n#S    A#\n#SSSS  #\n# ASS  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 42\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (3, 6).\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT.\nThe allowed next moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n\n1.  **Check move RIGHT:** The position (3, 7) contains a wall '#'. Moving RIGHT will cause a collision.\n2.  **Check move UP:** The position (2, 6) contains an apple 'A'. Moving UP is safe and will eat the apple.\n3.  **Check move DOWN:** The position (4, 6) is empty (' '). Moving DOWN is safe.\n\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, increasing the score and length. This is the primary objective besides survival. Moving DOWN is safe but doesn't yield immediate points. Moving RIGHT leads to game over. Therefore, moving UP is the best option.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#SS    #\n#SSS HA#\n#S SSS #\n#S    A#\n#SSS   #\n# ASS  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 5). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves:\n1.  **UP:** Move to (1, 5). This square is empty. Valid move.\n2.  **DOWN:** Invalid move, as the snake cannot reverse direction (UP to DOWN).\n3.  **LEFT:** Move to (2, 4). This square is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). Invalid move (collision).\n4.  **RIGHT:** Move to (2, 6). This square contains an apple ('A'). Valid move. This move will eat the apple, increase the score, and grow the snake.\n\nComparing valid moves:\n- UP: Safe, moves to an empty square (1, 5).\n- RIGHT: Safe, moves to an apple square (2, 6), eats the apple.\n\nSince the goal is to eat apples, moving RIGHT is the optimal move as it eats an apple immediately and leaves the snake in a safe position with options to move UP or DOWN in the next step.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SS    #\n#SSS SH#\n#S SSS #\n#S    A#\n#SSS  A#\n# ASS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 44\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1.  **RIGHT**: The snake's head is at (row 2, col 6).

This is a valid move.\n3.  **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would lead to (3, 6). This square is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This results in a collision and game over.\n4.  **LEFT**: The current direction is RIGHT, so moving LEFT is not allowed (cannot reverse direction).\n\nThe only valid and non-losing move is UP.

Moving UP would result in a collision.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** This is not allowed because it's the reverse of the current direction UP.\n3.  **Move LEFT:** The square to the left of the head (1, 5) is empty ' '.

The current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake body 'S' occupies multiple cells, including (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4).\nThe walls '#' are at the borders.\n\nPossible moves for the snake head:\n1.  **LEFT:** Move to (1, 3). This cell is currently empty ' '. This move is allowed as it's not reversing direction.\n    *   Consequence: If the snake moves LEFT to (1, 3), the direction becomes LEFT. The next possible moves from (1, 3) would be:\n        *   LEFT to (1, 2): Collision with body 'S'.\n        *   UP to (0, 3): Collision with wall '#'.\n        *   DOWN to (2, 3): Collision with body 'S'.\n    *   Moving LEFT leads to a state where all subsequent moves result in game over.\n\n2.  **RIGHT:** Move to (1, 5). This move is disallowed because it reverses the current direction (LEFT).\n\n3.  **UP:** Move to (0, 4). This cell contains a wall '#'. Collision, game over. This move is invalid.\n\n4.  **DOWN:** Move to (2, 4). This cell is currently empty ' '. This move is allowed as it's not reversing direction.\n    *   Consequence: If the snake moves DOWN to (2, 4), the direction becomes DOWN. The next possible moves from (2, 4) would be:\n        *   LEFT to (2, 3): Collision with body 'S'.\n        *   DOWN to (3, 4): Collision with body 'S'.\n        *   RIGHT to (2, 5): Collision with body 'S'.\n        *   UP: Reversing direction, disallowed.\n    *   Moving DOWN leads to a state where all subsequent moves result in game over.\n\nBoth valid moves (LEFT and DOWN) lead to an immediate trap where the snake will collide on the very next turn. Since survival is impossible beyond the next step regardless of the choice, we can use a secondary heuristic like moving towards the nearest apple.\nThe apples are at (4, 6), (5, 6), and (6, 1). The nearest apple to the head (1, 4) is at (4, 6) (Manhattan distance 5).\n- Moving LEFT to (1, 3) increases the distance to (4, 6) to 6.\n- Moving DOWN to (2, 4) decreases the distance to (4, 6) to 4.\nTherefore, moving DOWN aligns slightly better with the goal of approaching an apple, even though it's ultimately futile in this trapped situation.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#SS SSS#\n#SSSHSS#\n#S SSS #\n#S    A#\n#S    A#\n# A    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBased on the current board and the direction DOWN, the snake's head is at position (6, 1) (row 6, column 1).

The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls.

Moving UP is not allowed as it reverses the current direction.\n1. Move LEFT: The head moves to (5, 1). This is an empty space '#'. Valid move.\n2. Move RIGHT: The head moves to (5, 3). This space contains an apple 'A'. Valid move, eats the apple.\n3. Move DOWN: The head moves to (6, 2). This is an empty space '#'. Valid move.\n\nTo maximize the score, the snake should aim to eat apples. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple at (5, 3) immediately. This increases the score and the snake's length.\n\nLet's analyze the state after moving RIGHT:\n- Head moves to (5, 3).\n- Snake eats the apple, grows. The old head position (5, 2) becomes the body 'S'.\n- New direction will be RIGHT.\n- Board state would be:\n  ########\n  #      #\n  #      #\n  #      #\n  #      #\n  # SH   #\n  #  A  A#\n  ########\nThis seems like a good move as it achieves the objective of eating an apple.\n\nLet's analyze the state after moving DOWN:\n- Head moves to (6, 2).\n- Snake does not eat an apple. The old head position (5, 2) becomes the body 'S'.\n- New direction will be DOWN.\n- Board state would be:\n  ########\n  #      #\n  #      #\n  #      #\n  #      #\n  # SA   #\n  # H A  A#\n  ########\nFrom here, the snake could move RIGHT to eat the apple at (6, 3) or LEFT. Moving DOWN would hit the wall.\n\nMoving RIGHT immediately eats an apple, which is the preferred strategy.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SH   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5, 5). The body (S) is at (5, 4).\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot move LEFT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (4, 5). This is an empty square.\n2.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (6, 5). This is an empty square.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (5, 6). This is an empty square.\n\nWe need to choose a move that helps the snake eat apples and avoid collisions.\nThere are apples at (1, 4), (6, 2), and (6, 6).\nThe distances (Manhattan distance) from the head (5, 5) to the apples are:\n- Apple (1, 4): |1-5| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n- Apple (6, 2): |6-5| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4\n- Apple (6, 6): |6-5| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 6). Let's see which move gets us closer:\n- Move UP: Head moves to (4, 5). Distance to (6, 6) is |6-4| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n- Move DOWN: Head moves to (6, 5). Distance to (6, 6) is |6-6| + |6-5| = 0 + 1 = 1.\n- Move RIGHT: Head moves to (5, 6). Distance to (6, 6) is |6-5| + |6-6| = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT move the snake one step closer to the nearest apple.\nLet's consider the move DOWN. The head moves to (6, 5). The next move could be RIGHT to reach the apple at (6, 6). This seems like a safe and productive path.\nLet's consider the move RIGHT. The head moves to (5, 6). The next move could be DOWN to reach the apple at (6, 6). This also seems safe.\n\nChoosing DOWN moves the snake towards the row where two apples are located (row 6). Let's choose DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SS   #\n#  H  A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot move UP.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The snake's head would move to coordinates (6, 2). This position is currently occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This would result in a collision with itself.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The snake's head would move to coordinates (6, 4). This position is empty. This is a valid move.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The snake's head would move to coordinates (7, 3). This position is a wall ('#'). This would result in a collision with the wall.\n\nThe only valid move that avoids collision is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  SH A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 3).

This is a valid move.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (7, 3). This square is a wall ('#'). This move leads to a collision and game over.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (6, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nComparing valid moves UP and RIGHT:\n- Moving UP moves the snake towards the center of the board, away from the nearby apple at (6, 6).\n- Moving RIGHT moves the snake towards the apple at (6, 6).\n\nTo maximize the score by eating apples, moving towards the apple at (6, 6) is a good strategy. Therefore, moving RIGHT is the chosen move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SSHA#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 5).

This square is empty and within the boundaries. It's a valid move.\n2.  **DOWN**: Move to (7, 5). This square is a wall '#'. Collision, invalid move.\n3.  **RIGHT**: Move to (6, 6). This square contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move. The snake will eat the apple, grow longer, and the score will increase.\n\nThe goal is to eat as many apples as possible. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. Moving UP is safe but delays eating an apple. Therefore, moving RIGHT is the better move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#   AA #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SSSH#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 6).

The snake's head is at (5, 6).\n2.  The snake's body segments are at (6, 6), (6, 5), and (6, 4).\n3.  The current direction is UP.\n4.  The snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\n5.  Moving RIGHT leads to a wall collision at (5, 7).\n6.  Moving UP leads to an empty square at (4, 6). This is a safe move and moves towards the apples at (1, 4) and (1, 5).\n7.  Moving LEFT leads to an empty square at (5, 5). This is a safe move and moves towards the apple at (2, 1).\n\nComparing UP and LEFT: Moving UP takes the snake towards two apples that are relatively close. Moving LEFT takes the snake towards a single, more distant apple. Moving UP seems like a better immediate strategy to increase the score.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#   AA #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#     H#\n#     S#\n#    SS#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 6). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move to (3, 6). This is an empty space. Valid move.\n2.  LEFT: Move to (4, 5). This is an empty space. Valid move.\n3.  RIGHT: Move to (4, 7). This is a wall ('#'). Invalid move (collision).\n4.  DOWN: Cannot move DOWN because the current direction is UP (reversing).\n\nWe need to choose between UP and LEFT.\n- Moving UP brings the head closer to the apples at (1, 4) and (1, 5), but keeps the snake near the right wall. The next state would have the head at (3, 6) and body at (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6).\n- Moving LEFT moves the head away from the right wall and towards the apple at (2, 1). It provides more maneuvering room. The next state would have the head at (4, 5) and body at (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6).\n\nMoving LEFT seems safer as it moves away from the wall and opens up more of the board. It also positions the snake to potentially go for the apple at (2, 1) or turn UP later for the other two apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#   AA #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#    HS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 4) and its body segments are at (4, 5), (5, 5), and (6, 5). The current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (opposite direction).\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (3, 4). This is an empty cell (' '). This move is safe and moves the snake closer to the apples at (1, 3) and (1, 4).\n2.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (5, 4). This is an empty cell (' '). This move is safe but moves away from all apples.\n3.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (4, 3). This is an empty cell (' '). This move is safe and moves towards the apple at (2, 1).\n\nComparing UP and LEFT: Moving UP positions the snake to potentially collect the two apples at (1, 3) and (1, 4) more quickly than moving LEFT towards the single apple at (2, 1). Therefore, UP is the better strategic move.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#   AA #\n#A     #\n#    H #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#      #\n########\n```\nThe snake's head is at (3, 4) and the current direction is UP.

This is a safe move.\n- Moving LEFT to (3, 3): This square is empty. It moves towards the apple at (2, 0). This is a safe move.\n- Moving RIGHT to (3, 5): This square is empty. It moves away from the apples. This is a safe move.\n\nThe best strategy is usually to move towards the nearest apple while ensuring safety. Moving UP positions the snake closer to the two apples at (1, 3) and (1, 4), particularly the one at (1, 4). This seems like the most promising move to increase the score quickly.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#   AA #\n#A   H #\n#    S #\n#    SS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 5).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head moves to (1, 5).

From there, a LEFT move will eat the apple at (1, 4).\nMoving LEFT positions the head at (2, 4). From there, an UP move will eat the apple at (1, 4).\nMoving UP seems reasonable as it brings the snake towards the row with two apples.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#   AH #\n#A   S #\n#    S #\n#    SS#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at coordinates (1, 6) (row 1, column 6, using 0-based indexing for the inner 6x6 grid, or row 2, column 7 in the full 8x8 grid).

Valid move.\n4.  **RIGHT:** The square to the right of the head (1, 7) is a wall (#). Collision. Invalid move.\n\nThe only valid move is LEFT. This move avoids collision with walls and the snake's body.

This keeps the snake near the top wall but moves towards the apples at (2, 0) and (3, 1).\n    *   **DOWN**: Moves the head to (2, 4). This moves the snake towards the center of the board and away from the top wall.

It also brings the head vertically closer to the apples.\n\nTherefore, DOWN seems slightly preferable.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n```\n########\n#   SS #\n#A  HS #\n# A  S #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 4) (row 2, column 4, 0-indexed inside the walls).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves:\n1.  **DOWN:** Move to (3, 4).

This square contains 'S' (snake body). This is an invalid move (collision).\n4.  **UP:** This is the reverse of the current direction (DOWN). This is an invalid move.\n\nValid moves are DOWN and LEFT.\n\nLet's evaluate the valid moves:\n-   **DOWN:** Moves the head to (3, 4). This positions the snake to potentially move towards the apple at (6, 4) or turn left towards the apple at (3, 1). The space below seems relatively open.\n-   **LEFT:** Moves the head to (2, 3). This positions the snake to potentially move towards the apples at (2, 0) or (3, 1). This path might require navigating closer to the existing snake body and the left wall.\n\nMoving DOWN seems like a safe move that keeps options open and heads towards a more open area with an apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#   SS #\n#A  SS #\n# A HS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 17\n\nYour goal is to choose the next move ('UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT') for the snake ('H').\nThe snake is currently at H(3, 4) (row 3, col 4), moving DOWN.\nThe snake body 'S' occupies (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5).\nApples 'A' are at (2, 0), (3, 1), (6, 4).\nWalls '#' surround the board.\n\n1.  **Check possible moves:** The snake is moving DOWN, so it cannot move UP. Possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n2.  **Analyze Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (3, 5). This position is occupied by the snake's body 'S'. Collision! This move is invalid.\n3.  **Analyze Move LEFT:** The head would move to (3, 3). This position is empty ('.'). This is a safe move. This move brings the head closer to the apple at (3, 1).\n4.  **Analyze Move DOWN:** The head would move to (4, 4). This position is empty ('.'). This is a safe move. This move brings the head closer to the apple at (6, 4).\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are safe moves and lead towards different apples.\n- Moving LEFT targets the apple at (3, 1). A path could be LEFT -> LEFT -> LEFT (Eat).\n- Moving DOWN targets the apple at (6, 4). A path could be DOWN -> DOWN -> DOWN (Eat).\n\nBoth paths seem viable. Choosing LEFT keeps the snake more towards the center\/left of the board, potentially offering more maneuvering room compared to moving down towards the bottom-right apple. The path to the apple at (3,1) seems safe and direct.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is a good strategy.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#   SS #\n#A  SS #\n# AHS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 18\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 4) (row 3, column 4, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies positions (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (1, 5), (1, 4).\nApples 'A' are at positions (2, 0), (3, 1), and (6, 4).\nThe current direction is LEFT. This means the snake will move from (3, 4) to (3, 3) in the current step, regardless of the input I provide now. My input determines the direction for the *next* step (after moving to (3, 3)).\n\nThe snake cannot reverse direction. Since the current direction is LEFT, I cannot choose RIGHT as the next direction. The possible inputs are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\nLet's analyze the outcomes of these inputs for the move *after* the snake reaches (3, 3):\n\n1.  **Input UP:**\n    - Current move (auto): H moves LEFT to (3, 3).\n    - Next move (controlled): H moves UP to (2, 3). This position is empty and safe. This path heads towards the apple at (2, 0). However, analysis shows that after eating the apple at (2,0), the snake gets trapped between the wall and its own body. This is a dangerous path.\n\n2.  **Input DOWN:**\n    - Current move (auto): H moves LEFT to (3, 3).\n    - Next move (controlled): H moves DOWN to (4, 3). This position is empty and safe. This path heads towards the apple at (6, 4). This path seems safe and leads to an apple, but it takes several moves.\n\n3.  **Input LEFT:**\n    - Current move (auto): H moves LEFT to (3, 3).\n    - Next move (controlled): H continues LEFT to (3, 2). This position is empty and safe. This path heads directly towards the apple at (3, 1), which is only one more step away (another LEFT move). After eating the apple at (3, 1), the snake will be at H(3, 1) and must turn UP or DOWN, both of which are safe moves and allow access to the remaining apples.\n\nComparing the options, inputting LEFT allows the snake to reach the nearest apple at (3, 1) quickly and safely, with good options afterwards. Inputting DOWN is safe but slower. Inputting UP leads to a trap.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#   SS #\n#A  SS #\n# HSS  #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 19\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 2). The current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (3, 1). This position is empty and safe. The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which would be one move (UP) away.\n2.  **Move UP:** The head moves to (2, 2). This position is empty and safe. The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which would be one move (LEFT) away.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head moves to (4, 2). This position is empty and safe. This moves away from the nearest apple at (2, 1) but towards the apples at (4, 6) and (6, 5).\n\nComparing LEFT and UP:\n- Both moves position the snake one step away from the apple at (2, 1).\n- Let's consider the situation *after* eating the apple at (2, 1).\n    - If we move LEFT now (head to 3, 1), the next move must be UP (head to 2, 1). The snake will be heading UP. The only valid turn from (2, 1) heading UP is RIGHT (to 2, 2), as LEFT hits a wall.\n    - If we move UP now (head to 2, 2), the next move must be LEFT (head to 2, 1). The snake will be heading LEFT. Valid turns from (2, 1) heading LEFT are UP (to 1, 1) and DOWN (to 3, 1). This provides more options immediately after eating the apple.\n\nTherefore, moving UP seems slightly more advantageous as it preserves more movement options for the subsequent turn after eating the apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#   SS #\n#AH S  #\n# SSS  #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 20\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 2).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reversing direction).\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n1.

This position is empty (' '). This is a valid and safe move. After this move, the only safe subsequent move would be UP.\n\nComparing the moves: Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is the primary goal. The move is safe, and there is a safe path forward after eating the apple.

The snake would be further from the apples.\n- Moving DOWN takes the head to (4, 1). This position is adjacent to an apple at (5, 1). This seems like a better move to get closer to an apple.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#   S  #\n#SS S  #\n#HSSS  #\n# A   A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 22\n\nThe current position of the snake head 'H' is at (row 3, column 1).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP (reverse direction).\nThe possible next moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n1.

Valid.\n\nLet's analyze the valid moves:\n-   Moving DOWN leads the head to (6, 1). The next mandatory move would be RIGHT to (6, 2) to avoid the wall and the reversal rule. This path leads directly towards the apple at (6, 4). Path: DOWN -> RIGHT -> RIGHT -> RIGHT (eats apple).\n-   Moving RIGHT leads the head to (5, 2). From here, the snake can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. This provides access to all three apples.\n    -   To apple (6, 4): RIGHT -> DOWN -> RIGHT -> RIGHT (eats apple).\n    -   To apple (4, 3): RIGHT -> UP -> RIGHT (eats apple).\n    -   To apple (4, 6): RIGHT -> UP -> RIGHT -> RIGHT -> RIGHT -> RIGHT (eats apple).\n\nMoving RIGHT offers more immediate flexibility and quicker paths to the apples located in row 4 compared to moving DOWN. While both moves allow reaching the apple at (6, 4) in 4 steps, choosing RIGHT maintains more options for subsequent moves.\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#      #\n#SS    #\n#SSS   #\n#SA   A#\n#SH    #\n#    A #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 25\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 2).

This is a valid move.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the moves in terms of getting closer to an apple:\n- Current head position: (4, 4).\n- Apples at: (1, 6), (4, 6), (6, 5).\n- Distances (Manhattan):\n    - To (1, 6): |4-1| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n    - To (4, 6): |4-4| + |4-6| = 0 + 2 = 2\n    - To (6, 5): |4-6| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- The closest apple is at (4, 6).\n\nLet's see where each valid move takes the head and the new distance to the closest apple (4, 6):\n- **Move UP:** Head to (3, 4). Distance to (4, 6) = |3-4| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n- **Move DOWN:** Head to (5, 4). Distance to (4, 6) = |5-4| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n- **Move RIGHT:** Head to (4, 5). Distance to (4, 6) = |4-4| + |5-6| = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nMoving RIGHT brings the snake closest to the nearest apple at (4, 6). The next move after RIGHT would be RIGHT again to eat the apple at (4, 6).

LEFT: Move to (4, 4). This position is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). Invalid move (collision).\n4.  RIGHT: Move to (4, 6). This position contains an apple ('A'). Valid move.\n\nStrategy: Prioritize eating apples if it's safe.\n- Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple at (4, 6) immediately. The head will be at (4, 6). The next move must be DOWN to (5, 6) as UP hits a wall. From (5, 6), the snake can move LEFT or DOWN. This path seems safe and increases the score.\n- Moving DOWN moves the head to (5, 5). From here, the snake can move DOWN again to eat the apple at (6, 5). This delays eating the apple by one turn but is also a safe move.\n- Moving UP moves the head to (3, 5), away from the nearby apples.\n\nMoving RIGHT eats an apple immediately and appears to be a safe maneuver for the subsequent steps.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SSSSHA#\n#SS    #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at row 4, column 6, represented by 'H'.\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe possible moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT (cannot move LEFT as it's the reverse direction).\n1.

This will end the game.\n3.  **Possible Inputs:** I need to change the direction *before* the next move. The current direction is RIGHT, so I cannot choose LEFT (reverse direction). The valid inputs are UP and DOWN.\n4.  **Analyze Input UP:**\n    *   If I input UP, the snake's head will move from (4, 7) to (3, 7) in the next step.\n    *   Position (3, 7) is empty (' '). This is a safe move.\n    *   This move positions the snake closer to the apple at (1, 7).\n5.  **Analyze Input DOWN:**\n    *   If I input DOWN, the snake's head will move from (4, 7) to (5, 7) in the next step.\n    *   Position (5, 7) is empty (' '). This is a safe move.\n    *   This move positions the snake closer to the apple at (6, 5).\n6.  **Decision:** Both UP and DOWN are safe moves that avoid immediate collision. Moving UP allows the snake to potentially reach the apple at (1, 7) in two more steps (UP, UP). Moving DOWN allows the snake to potentially reach the apple at (6, 5) in three more steps (DOWN, LEFT, LEFT). Moving UP seems slightly more direct towards the nearest accessible apple.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP to avoid the wall collision and head towards the apple at (1, 7).\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n#S    H#\n#SSSSSS#\n#SS    #\n#    A #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 31\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3, 6).

Moving RIGHT from (2, 2) to (2, 3) would position the snake well to approach the apple at (3, 3). Moving LEFT from (2, 2) to (2, 1) would also position the snake towards the apple at (6, 1).\n\nMoving DOWN keeps more options open and provides potential routes to two different apples ((3, 3) and (6, 1)), while moving LEFT forces the snake into a more constrained position.

UP: This is the reverse of the current direction (DOWN), so it's an invalid move.\n\nWe need to choose between DOWN and LEFT.\nMoving DOWN to (5, 5) positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (6, 5) in the next step by moving DOWN again.\nMoving LEFT to (4, 4) moves away from the immediate vicinity of the apples at (6, 4) and (6, 5).\n\nLet's analyze the path starting with DOWN:\n- Move DOWN to (5, 5).\n- Move DOWN to (6, 5) (eat apple). Direction is DOWN.\n- Move LEFT to (6, 4) (eat apple). Direction is LEFT.\n- Move LEFT to (6, 3). Direction is LEFT.\n- Move LEFT to (6, 2). Direction is LEFT.\n- Move LEFT to (6, 1) (eat apple). Direction is LEFT.\nThis path seems safe and collects all apples efficiently.\n\nLet's analyze the path starting with LEFT:\n- Move LEFT to (4, 4).\n- Move DOWN to (5, 4).\n- Move DOWN to (6, 4) (eat apple). Direction is DOWN.\n- Move RIGHT to (6, 5) (eat apple). Direction is RIGHT.\n- From (6, 5) moving RIGHT, the only valid move is UP to (5, 5).\n- From (5, 5) moving UP, the snake gets trapped as LEFT, RIGHT, and UP lead to its own body or a wall.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is the better and safer strategy.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n```\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSS S#\n# SSS S#\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#A  AA #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 44\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at row 4, column 3 (0-indexed from top-left).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (4, 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a safe move.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (4, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a safe move.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (5, 3). This square is empty (' '). This is a safe move.\n\nThe apples 'A' are located in row 6. Moving DOWN brings the snake closer to the row with the apples. Moving LEFT or RIGHT keeps the snake in the same row but positions it differently relative to the apples. Moving DOWN seems the most direct approach to get closer to the apples while maintaining options to turn left or right in subsequent moves to target specific apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n```\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSS S#\n# SSS  #\n#   S  #\n#   H  #\n#A  AA #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 45\n\nMy goal is to move the snake (H) to eat apples (A) without hitting the walls (#) or the snake's body (S). The snake is currently at (5, 3) and moving DOWN. The apples are at (6, 0), (6, 4), and (6, 5).\n\n1.  **Analyze Possible Moves:**\n    *   **UP:** Cannot move UP, as the current direction is DOWN (snake cannot reverse).\n    *   **LEFT:** Moving LEFT would lead to (5, 2). This square is occupied by the snake's body (S). This move leads to collision and is invalid.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Moving RIGHT would lead to (5, 4). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n    *   **DOWN:** Moving DOWN would lead to (6, 3). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Valid Moves:**\n    *   **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (5, 4). The next direction will be RIGHT. From (5, 4), the snake can move UP (to 4, 4 - empty), DOWN (to 6, 4 - Apple!), or RIGHT (to 5, 5 - empty). This path allows eating the apple at (6, 4) in the next step.\n    *   **Move DOWN:** The head moves to (6, 3). The next direction will be DOWN. From (6, 3), the snake can move LEFT (to 6, 2 - empty), RIGHT (to 6, 4 - Apple!), or DOWN (to 7, 3 - Wall!). This path also allows eating the apple at (6, 4) in the next step, but one of the subsequent options is a wall collision.\n\n3.  **Decision:**\n    Both RIGHT and DOWN are valid moves that position the snake to eat an apple in the next turn. Moving RIGHT keeps the snake head in row 5, slightly further from the bottom edge compared to moving DOWN which places the head in row 6. Moving RIGHT also avoids placing the head in a position where one of the next possible moves is an immediate wall collision. Therefore, RIGHT seems slightly safer and offers good potential for eating the nearby apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSS  #\n# SSS  #\n#   S  #\n#   SH #\n#A  AA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 46\n\nThe snake's head is at row 6, column 5 (H).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (cannot move LEFT as it's the reverse direction).\n- Moving DOWN would hit the bottom wall (#) at row 7, column 5. This leads to game over.\n- Moving RIGHT would hit the right wall (#) at row 6, column 6. This leads to game over.\n- Moving UP would move the head to row 5, column 5. This square is empty ( ). This is a valid move.\n\nTherefore, the only safe move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n# SSSS #\n# SSS  #\n# SSS  #\n#   SH #\n#   SS #\n#A  AA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 47\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move to (3, 6). This square is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n2.  DOWN: This move is invalid because the snake cannot reverse its direction (current direction is UP).\n3.  LEFT: Move to (4, 5). This square is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This move is invalid due to self-collision.\n4.  RIGHT: Move to (4, 7). This square is a wall ('#'). This move is invalid due to wall collision.\n\nThe only valid move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n# SSS  #\n# SSS  #\n# SSSH #\n#   SS #\n#   SS #\n#A  AA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  The snake's head (H) is at coordinates (3, 5) (row 3, column 5, 0-indexed from top-left inside the walls).\n2.  The current direction is UP.\n3.  We need to determine the next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n4.  The snake cannot reverse direction, so DOWN is not allowed (current direction is UP).\n5.  Check remaining possible moves:\n    *   Move UP: The head would move to (2, 5). The cell at (2, 5) is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n    *   Move LEFT: The head would move to (3, 4). The cell at (3, 4) is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n    *   Move RIGHT: The head would move to (3, 6). The cell at (3, 6) is a wall ('#'). This move leads to collision and is invalid.\n6.  Valid moves are UP and LEFT.\n7.  Let's evaluate the consequences:\n    *   Moving UP to (2, 5) allows subsequent moves UP (to 1, 5) or LEFT (to 2, 4).\n    *   Moving LEFT to (3, 4) forces the next move to be UP (to 2, 4), as LEFT (3, 3) and DOWN (4, 4) are blocked by the snake's body ('S').\n8.  Although both paths seem problematic in the long run, moving UP leaves slightly more options open for the *next* move compared to moving LEFT. Therefore, UP is chosen.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n# SS   #\n# SSSH #\n# SSSS #\n#   SS #\n#   SS #\n#A  AA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 49\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6, 2) (row 2, column 6, 0-indexed from top-left inside the walls).\nThe current direction is UP.\nMoving UP would lead to position (6, 1), which contains 'S' (snake body).

The current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves:\n1.  **UP:** Move to (3, 4). This is an empty space, safe. This move is valid as it's not reversing direction. This moves towards the apples at (1,5) and (2,2).\n2.  **DOWN:** Move to (5, 4). This is an empty space, safe. This move is valid as it's not reversing direction. This moves away from the apples.\n3.  **LEFT:** Move to (4, 3). This is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This is also an invalid direction change (reversing RIGHT). This leads to collision.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Move to (4, 5). This is an empty space, safe. This continues the current direction. This moves towards the apple at (1,5).\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe moves that position the snake towards an apple. Moving UP moves the snake towards two closer apples ((1,5) and (2,2)) and keeps it more central. Moving RIGHT moves towards one apple (1,5). Moving UP seems like a slightly better strategic choice for flexibility.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n# A   A#\n#  A   #\n#   H  #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (3, 4) (row 3, column 4, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe snake body 'S' is at position (4, 4).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe apples 'A' are at (1, 1), (1, 5), and (2, 2).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move head to (2, 4). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid move and does not reverse direction.\n2.  LEFT: Move head to (3, 3). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid move and does not reverse direction.\n3.  RIGHT: Move head to (3, 5). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid move and does not reverse direction.\n4.  DOWN: This move is invalid because it reverses the current direction (UP).\n\nAnalysis:\n- Moving UP moves the snake towards the general area of the apples, specifically closer to the apple at (2, 2). The next position (2, 4) is safe.\n- Moving LEFT also moves the snake towards the apple at (2, 2). The next position (3, 3) is safe.\n- Moving RIGHT moves the snake away from the closest apples. The next position (3, 5) is safe but less strategic for eating apples quickly.\n\nChoosing between UP and LEFT: Both moves are safe and position the snake well to approach the apple at (2, 2). Continuing in the current direction (UP) is a reasonable strategy when multiple safe options exist that move towards food. Moving UP to (2, 4) allows for a subsequent LEFT turn to approach the apple at (2, 2).\n\nTherefore, moving UP is a good choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n# A   A#\n#  AH  #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at row 2, column 4 (H). The body is at row 3, column 4 (S).\nThe current direction is UP. The snake cannot move DOWN.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (1, 4). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (2, 3). This square contains an apple (A). Eating the apple increases the score and the snake's length. This is a valid move.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (2, 5). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n\nThe goal is to eat apples. Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. This is the most advantageous move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n# A   A#\n#  HS  #\n#   S  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 3).\nThe snake's body 'S' is at positions (2, 4) and (3, 4).\nThe apples 'A' are at positions (1, 1), (1, 6), and (4, 4).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\n\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT as it's the opposite of the current direction.\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (2, 2). This position is empty and not a wall. This move is safe. It moves towards the apple at (1, 1).\n2.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (1, 3). This position is empty and not a wall. This move is safe. It moves towards the apples at (1, 1) and (1, 6).\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (3, 3). This position is empty and not a wall. This move is safe. It moves towards the apple at (4, 4).\n\nAll three moves are safe in the immediate step. Let's consider the apples.\n- Apple at (1, 1): Closest via LEFT or UP.\n- Apple at (1, 6): Closest via UP.\n- Apple at (4, 4): Closest via DOWN.\n\nMoving UP positions the snake closer to two apples (1, 1) and (1, 6) and keeps future options open (can turn LEFT or RIGHT in the next step). Moving LEFT also positions well for the apple at (1,1). Moving DOWN targets the apple at (4,4) but might restrict movement slightly in the next step (cannot turn right into the body).\n\nMoving UP seems like a good strategic choice as it heads towards the top row containing two apples.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n# AH  A#\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 3) (row 1, column 3, using 0-based indexing for rows and columns inside the walls). The current direction is UP.\nPossible next moves:\n1.  **UP:** The head would move to (0, 3), which is a wall ('#'). This leads to game over.\n2.  **LEFT:** The head would move to (1, 2), which is empty (' '). This is a valid move (UP to LEFT is allowed). This moves towards the apple at (1, 1).\n3.  **RIGHT:** The head would move to (1, 4), which is empty (' '). This is a valid move (UP to RIGHT is allowed). This moves towards the apple at (1, 6).\n4.  **DOWN:** This move is not allowed because the snake cannot reverse its direction (UP to DOWN).\n\nComparing LEFT and RIGHT: Both are safe moves. Moving LEFT leads towards the apple at (1, 1) which is closer (2 moves away: LEFT, LEFT) than the apple at (1, 6) (3 moves away: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT). Moving LEFT is a good strategy to eat the nearest apple.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n# HS  A#\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 2). The current direction is LEFT.\nPossible moves:\n1.  LEFT: Move to (1, 1). This is an empty space. Valid.\n2.  UP: Move to (0, 2). This is a wall '#'. Invalid (collision).\n3.  DOWN: Move to (2, 2). This is an empty space. Valid.\n4.  RIGHT: Cannot reverse direction from LEFT. Invalid.\n\nComparing valid moves:\n- Moving LEFT to (1, 1) places the snake in the top-left corner. The only subsequent move would be DOWN.\n- Moving DOWN to (2, 2) keeps the snake more central and provides paths towards the apples at (4, 4) and (6, 3).\n\nMoving DOWN is strategically better as it provides more options and moves towards the available apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n# SS  A#\n# HS   #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake head is at (2, 1). The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. UP is invalid (reversing direction).\n1.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (2, 0), which is a wall '#'. Collision. Invalid.\n2.  Move RIGHT: Head moves to (2, 2), which is empty ' '. Valid.\n3.  Move DOWN: Head moves to (3, 1), which is empty ' '. Valid.\n\nLet's evaluate the valid moves:\n- Move RIGHT: Head at (2, 2). The snake body will be at (2, 1) and (1, 1). This move is safe. It moves towards the apples at (4, 3) and (6, 3).\n- Move DOWN: Head at (3, 1). The snake body will be at (2, 1) and (1, 1). This move is safe. It also moves towards the apples at (4, 3) and (6, 3).\n\nBoth moves are safe and move towards apples. Moving DOWN positions the snake more centrally towards the two lower apples. Let's choose DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n# SS  A#\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 9\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 2). The current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot move UP.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n1.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (3, 1). This is an empty space and not a wall. Valid move.\n2.  Move RIGHT: Head moves to (3, 3). This is an empty space and not a wall. Valid move.\n3.  Move DOWN: Head moves to (4, 2). This is an empty space and not a wall. Valid move.\n\nApples are located at (1, 6), (4, 4), and (6, 3).\nThe closest apple is at (4, 4).\n-   Moving LEFT (to 3, 1) increases the distance to (4, 4) (|4-3| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4).\n-   Moving RIGHT (to 3, 3) decreases the distance to (4, 4) (|4-3| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2).\n-   Moving DOWN (to 4, 2) decreases the distance to (4, 4) (|4-4| + |4-2| = 0 + 2 = 2).\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN move towards the nearest apple at (4, 4). Let's consider the next step.\n-   If I move RIGHT (head at 3, 3, direction RIGHT): I can then move DOWN to (4, 3) or RIGHT to (3, 4), both getting closer to (4, 4).\n-   If I move DOWN (head at 4, 2, direction DOWN): I can then move RIGHT to (4, 3), getting closer to (4, 4). Moving LEFT (4, 1) or DOWN (5, 2) moves away from (4, 4).\n\nMoving DOWN positions the snake's head on the same row as the target apple (4, 4) and closer vertically to the apple at (6, 3). Moving RIGHT keeps the snake higher up but positions it closer horizontally to the apple at (4, 4). Both seem reasonable. Moving DOWN seems slightly better positioned for the lower two apples.\n\nLet's choose DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n# S   A#\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# H A  #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake head is at (4, 2). The current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n1.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (4, 1). This is an empty square and a valid move. It moves away from the nearby apples.\n2.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (4, 3). This is an empty square and a valid move. This positions the snake to eat the apple at (4, 4) in the next step by moving RIGHT again.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head moves to (5, 2). This is an empty square and a valid move. This moves towards the apple at (6, 3).\n\nComparing the moves:\n- LEFT moves away from apples.\n- RIGHT positions the snake to eat the apple at (4, 4) immediately in the next turn.\n- DOWN moves towards the apple at (6, 3) but requires more steps (DOWN, RIGHT).\n\nMoving RIGHT is the most advantageous move as it leads directly to eating the closest apple in the next step.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#     A#\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# SHA  #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 4).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT. Moving LEFT is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (3, 4). This is an empty square ' '. This is a safe move.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (5, 4). This is an empty square ' '. This is a safe move.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (4, 5). This square contains an apple 'A'. Eating the apple increases the score and length. The new head position (4, 5) is not a wall '#' and not part of the snake's current body ('S' at (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3)). This is a safe move and achieves the goal of eating an apple.\n\nSince moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple safely, it is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#     A#\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# SSH  #\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 12\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake head is at (4, 5) (row 4, column 5). The current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. LEFT is not allowed because it's the reverse direction.\n1.  Move UP: Target square is (3, 5). It's empty. Valid.\n2.  Move DOWN: Target square is (5, 5). It's empty. Valid.\n3.  Move RIGHT: Target square is (4, 6). It's empty. Valid.\n\nApples are located at (1, 6), (6, 2), and (6, 6).\n- Moving UP heads towards the wall initially but could curve towards the apple at (1, 6).\n- Moving RIGHT heads towards the wall and the apple at (1, 6) or (6, 6). Path to (6, 6): RIGHT -> (4, 6) -> DOWN -> (5, 6) -> DOWN -> (6, 6). (3 moves)\n- Moving DOWN heads towards the two apples at the bottom. Path to (6, 6): DOWN -> (5, 5) -> RIGHT -> (5, 6) -> DOWN -> (6, 6). (3 moves). Path towards (6, 2): DOWN -> (5, 5) -> DOWN -> (6, 5) -> LEFT... (longer).\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN lead to the apple at (6, 6) in 3 moves. Moving DOWN seems slightly better as it positions the snake towards both bottom apples and keeps it slightly further from the right wall for the first move compared to moving RIGHT immediately. Let's choose DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#     A#\n#      #\n# S    #\n# SSS  #\n#   H  #\n#  A  A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 13\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head is at (5, 3). The current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (5, 2). This square is empty. This move is safe. It positions the snake to potentially move DOWN to eat the apple at (6, 2) in the next step.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (5, 4). This square is empty. This move is safe. It positions the snake further from the apple at (6, 2) but closer to the apple at (6, 6).\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head moves to (6, 3). This square is empty. This move is safe. It positions the snake directly above the bottom wall, but adjacent to the apple at (6, 2). Moving LEFT in the next step would eat the apple.\n\nComparing the options:\n- Both LEFT and DOWN position the snake well to eat the apple at (6, 2) in the next move.\n- Moving DOWN gets the head onto the same row as the two bottom apples. Moving DOWN then LEFT eats the apple at (6,2). Moving DOWN then RIGHT moves towards the apple at (6,6).\n- Moving LEFT then DOWN eats the apple at (6,2). However, after moving LEFT, moving UP would cause a collision with the body segment at (4,2).\n\nMoving DOWN seems slightly more flexible for the subsequent move, allowing either LEFT (eat apple) or RIGHT (move towards other apple). Therefore, I choose DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n#   S  #\n#  AH A#\n########\n```\nBased on the current game board and rules:\nThe snake's head is at position (6, 4) (row 6, column 4, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP because it's the reverse direction.\nLet's evaluate the other possible moves:\n1.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (7, 4), which is a wall '#'. This leads to game over.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (6, 3), which is occupied by the snake's body 'S'. This leads to game over.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (6, 5), which is an empty space. This is a valid move.\n\nThe only valid move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#   S  #\n#  ASHA#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 15\n\nMy analysis:\n1.  The snake's head ('H') is at position (6, 5).\n2.  The current direction is RIGHT.\n3.  Possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT is invalid as it's the reverse direction).\n4.  Check potential outcomes for valid moves:\n    *   **UP:** Move to (5, 5). This square is empty (' '). This is a safe move.\n    *   **DOWN:** Move to (7, 5). This square contains a wall ('#'). This leads to a game over.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Move to (6, 6). This square contains an apple ('A'). This move eats the apple, increases the score, grows the snake, and is safe.\n5.  Comparing the safe moves: Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately and increase the score. Moving UP is safe but doesn't yield an immediate point. Eating the apple is generally the preferred strategy when safe. After moving RIGHT to (6,6) and eating the apple, the only possible next move would be UP to (5,6) which is also safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#     A#\n# A    #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#   S  #\n#  ASSH#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 6) (row 6, column 6, 0-indexed inside walls).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible next moves are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.

This is a valid move, the snake eats the apple, grows longer, and the score increases.\n\nTherefore, the only valid and beneficial move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#    SS#\n# SSSSS#\n# S    #\n# HAA  #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 28\n\nAnalysis:\nThe snake head 'H' is at coordinates (4, 1) (row 4, column 1, 0-indexed).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP, as it's the reverse direction.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n1.  Check move LEFT: The head would move to (4, 0), which is a wall '#'. This leads to game over.\n2.  Check move RIGHT: The head would move to (4, 2), which contains an apple 'A'. The snake eats the apple, increases score by 1, and grows in length. This is a valid and beneficial move. The new head position (4, 2) is not a wall or body part.\n3.  Check move DOWN: The head would move to (5, 1), which is an empty square ' '. This is a valid move. The snake moves without eating an apple.\n\nComparing RIGHT and DOWN:\n- Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately and positions it to potentially eat the second adjacent apple at (4, 3) in the next step. This seems like a good offensive strategy.\n- Moving DOWN is safe but does not yield an immediate score increase. It positions the snake closer to the apple at (6, 2).\n\nEating an apple is generally preferred. The path starting with RIGHT seems safe and leads to eating multiple apples quickly. Let's trace the first few steps:\n- Move RIGHT: Head at (4, 2), eats 'A'. Snake grows. Current Direction: RIGHT.\n- Next possible moves: RIGHT (to (4, 3), eats 'A'), DOWN (to (5, 2)). LEFT hits new body at (4, 1), UP is reverse.\n- If next move is RIGHT: Head at (4, 3), eats 'A'. Snake grows again. Current Direction: RIGHT. Only valid move is DOWN (to (5, 3)). This path seems safe and collects two apples rapidly.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is the best immediate action.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#    SS#\n# SSSSS#\n# S    #\n# SHAA #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n```\nThe snake's head is at (4, 4).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe possible moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.

Safe.\n- Moving RIGHT: Head moves to (4, 5). This space contains an apple ('A'). Safe, eats an apple, increases score and length.\n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. Let's check the consequences. After moving RIGHT, the head will be at (4, 5), and the snake will grow. The next apple is at (4, 6), which can be reached by moving RIGHT again. After eating the apple at (4, 6), the head will be at (4, 6). Moving RIGHT again would hit the wall at (4, 7). However, from (4, 6), the snake can turn UP (to 3, 6) or DOWN (to 5, 6), both of which are safe. Eating the apple now is beneficial and does not lead to an immediate trap.\n\nMoving UP or DOWN would move away from the two adjacent apples. Moving DOWN positions the snake closer to the apple at (6, 3), but requires more moves to reach it compared to the immediate apple available by moving RIGHT.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#    SS#\n# SSSSS#\n# S    #\n# SSHA #\n#      #\n# AA   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 30\n\nMy goal is to eat apples ('A') while avoiding collisions with walls ('#') and the snake's body ('S').

Identify the snake's head position: The head 'H' is at coordinates (6, 4).\n2.  Identify the current direction: The snake is moving LEFT.\n3.  Identify possible moves: The snake can continue LEFT, turn UP, or turn DOWN. It cannot turn RIGHT (reverse direction).\n4.  Evaluate each possible move:\n    *   **LEFT:** The square to the left of the head is (6, 3). This square is empty ('.'). It is not a wall ('#') or part of the snake's body ('S'). This move is safe. Moving left also positions the snake to potentially eat the apples at (6, 2) and (6, 1) in subsequent moves.\n    *   **UP:** The square above the head is (5, 4). This square is empty ('.'). It is not a wall ('#') or part of the snake's body ('S'). This move is safe for the immediate next step. However, after moving UP, the snake's head would be at (5, 4), and the only safe subsequent move would be LEFT, as moving UP again (to 4, 4) or RIGHT (to 5, 5) would result in a collision with the snake's body. This path seems more restrictive.\n    *   **DOWN:** The square below the head is (7, 4). This square contains a wall ('#'). This move would result in a collision and game over.\n\n5.  Strategic decision: Moving LEFT is safe and positions the snake closer to the apples at (6, 1) and (6, 2). Moving UP is also safe initially but leads to a potentially tricky position with limited future moves. Moving DOWN results in immediate game over. Therefore, moving LEFT is the most sensible move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n# SSSS #\n# SA   #\n# SSSS #\n#A   S #\n# AHSS #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6, 2) (row 6, column 2, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies several squares.\nApples 'A' are at positions (3, 3) and (5, 1). The head 'H' is currently on the location where an apple was in the previous state (6, 2), meaning it has just consumed it and will grow in the next step.\n\nAvailable moves:\n1.  **UP**: Move to (5, 2). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n2.  **DOWN**: Move to (7, 2). This square is a wall '#'. This move leads to collision and game over.\n3.  **LEFT**: Move to (6, 1). This square contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Cannot move RIGHT because the current direction is LEFT (snake cannot reverse direction).\n\nEvaluating valid moves:\n-   **UP**: Moves the head to (5, 2). The snake does not eat an apple this turn. The next position (5, 2) is safe. From (5, 2), possible moves are LEFT (to apple at (5, 1)) or RIGHT (to empty (5, 3)), as UP and DOWN would hit the snake's body.\n-   **LEFT**: Moves the head to (6, 1). The snake eats the apple at (6, 1). Score increases, and the snake grows. The next position (6, 1) is safe. From (6, 1), the only possible move would be UP to (5, 1) (empty), as LEFT and DOWN hit walls, and RIGHT hits the snake's body.\n\nComparing the moves, moving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is the goal of the game. The subsequent move (UP) is forced but safe and leads towards the center of the board. Moving UP initially delays eating the apple and leads to a position with choices, one of which (going RIGHT multiple times) could potentially lead to a trap against the snake's own body later on. Therefore, moving LEFT is the better strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#      #\n# SSSS #\n# SA   #\n#ASSSS #\n#A   S #\n# HSSS #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 36\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6, 2).\nThe current direction is LEFT.

This is a good next move.\n\n*   **If we move UP:**\n    -   The new head position is (5, 2), the direction remains UP.\n    -   From (5, 2), the only possible moves are LEFT (to 5, 1) or RIGHT (to 5, 3).\n    -   RIGHT moves the head to (5, 3), which is occupied by the snake's body 'S' (at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) etc., let's check precisely: Head(6,2) -> S(6,2). Body shifts. Initial Body: (6,3)...(2,5). After UP: H(5,2), Body: (6,2)...(2,4). Tail (2,5) removed. So (5,3) is empty. Ah, wait, initial body has S at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So (5,3) is indeed empty. My mistake. Let's re-evaluate. (5, 3) is empty. Need to retrace the collision check. If move UP -> H(5,2), possible moves LEFT(5,1 'A'), RIGHT(5,3 ' ').\n    -   LEFT moves the head to (5, 1), which contains an apple 'A'.

This is an invalid move (collision).\n3.  Turn DOWN: Move head to (2, 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid and safe move.\n\nWe need to choose between RIGHT and DOWN.\n- Moving RIGHT keeps the head in row 1, maintaining distance from the dense body below row 3. The path towards the apples would likely be RIGHT -> DOWN -> ...\n- Moving DOWN moves the head to row 2, closer to the apples (at row 3) but also closer to the dense body formation. The path towards the apples would likely be DOWN -> RIGHT -> ... or DOWN -> DOWN -> ...\n\nBoth moves seem viable for reaching the apples eventually. However, the snake body is very concentrated in the lower part of the board (rows 3 to 6). Moving RIGHT keeps the head in the more open upper area (rows 1 and 2) for one more step, potentially allowing for better positioning before committing to navigating the tighter space near the apples and the snake's body. Therefore, moving RIGHT appears to be the slightly safer option, preserving flexibility.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#SSH   #\n#S     #\n#S AAA #\n#S SSS #\n#S   S #\n#SSSSS #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 44\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  The snake's head 'H' is at position (1, 3) (row 1, column 3, using 0-based indexing for rows\/columns inside the walls).\n2.  The snake's body 'S' occupies multiple squares, including parts of row 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The tail appears to be at (4, 3). Let's trace: H(1,3)->(1,2)->(1,1)->(2,1)->(3,1)->(4,1)->(5,1)->(6,1)->(6,2)->(6,3)->(6,4)->(6,5)->(5,5)->(4,5)->(4,4)->(4,3). Yes, the tail is at (4,3).\n3.  Apples 'A' are located at (3, 3), (3, 4), and (3, 5).\n4.  The current direction is RIGHT.\n5.  The snake cannot reverse direction, so moving LEFT is forbidden.\n6.  Possible next moves:\n    *   UP: Move to (0, 3). This is a wall '#'. Collision -> Invalid.\n    *   RIGHT: Move to (1, 4). This square is empty ' '. Valid.\n    *   DOWN: Move to (2, 3). This square is empty ' '. Valid.\n    *   LEFT: Forbidden due to current direction being RIGHT.\n\n7.  Evaluate valid moves:\n    *   Move RIGHT: Head moves to (1, 4). Snake remains in the upper part, further from the apples. The path towards apples would likely involve turning DOWN later.\n    *   Move DOWN: Head moves to (2, 3). This positions the snake directly above the apple at (3, 3).\n\n8.  Consider the move DOWN in more detail:\n    *   Head moves to (2, 3). The tail at (4, 3) is removed.\n    *   The new state has the head at (2, 3), direction DOWN.\n    *   From (2, 3), the snake can move RIGHT (to 2, 4 - empty), DOWN (to 3, 3 - Apple), or LEFT (to 2, 2 - empty). UP is forbidden (reversing direction).\n    *   Moving DOWN again immediately eats an apple at (3, 3). Let's check if this leads to a trap. If the head moves to (3, 3) (eating the apple), the direction is DOWN. The square below (4, 3) was the tail in the original configuration, and is now empty. So moving DOWN again after eating the apple is safe (head moves to (4,3)).\n\n9.  Conclusion: Moving DOWN positions the snake well to eat the apples starting with the one at (3, 3) without immediate danger. Moving RIGHT is also safe but less direct. Therefore, DOWN is the preferred move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n```\n########\n#SSS   #\n#S H   #\n#S AAA #\n#S  SS #\n#S   S #\n#SSSSS #\n########\n```\nThe current direction is DOWN.

Moving UP is not allowed as it's the reverse of the current direction.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (3, 2), which is occupied by the snake's body 'S'. This results in a collision and game over.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (3, 4), which contains an apple 'A'. The snake eats the apple, grows, and the score increases. This move is safe.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (4, 3), which is occupied by the snake's body 'S'.

This move leads to collision and game over.\n\nComparing valid moves:\n- Moving UP keeps the snake alive but doesn't eat an apple.\n- Moving DOWN keeps the snake alive and eats an apple.\n\nEating apples is the goal. Moving DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple at (3, 5). Let's check the consequences. After moving DOWN, the head will be at (3, 5), and the direction will be DOWN. The snake will grow. From (3, 5), the possible moves will be LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. Moving RIGHT (to 3, 6) is a wall. Moving DOWN (to 4, 5) hits the snake's body ('S').

Moving UP will place the snake's head 'H' onto the apple 'A' at row 3, column 3. This is a valid move as the snake is currently moving UP and UP is not the reverse direction. This move also results in eating an apple, increasing the score and the snake's length.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#  S   #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nAnalyzing the possible moves:\n1.  **UP**: Move to (2, 3). This is a safe empty square. The snake will be H at (2, 3), S at (3, 3). This moves towards the apple at (2, 6).\n2.  **LEFT**: Move to (3, 2). This is a safe empty square. The snake will be H at (3, 2), S at (3, 3). This moves away from the apples.\n3.  **RIGHT**: Move to (3, 4). This is a safe empty square. The snake will be H at (3, 4), S at (3, 3). This moves towards the apples at (2, 6) and (6, 6).\n4.  **DOWN**: Cannot move DOWN because the current direction is UP.\n\nComparing safe moves:\n- UP positions the snake at (2, 3), closer to the apple at (2, 6).\n- RIGHT positions the snake at (3, 4), also allowing movement towards the apple at (2, 6) or (6, 6).\n- LEFT moves away from apples.\n\nMoving UP seems like a good strategy to approach the apple at (2, 6). Moving RIGHT is also reasonable. Let's choose UP to directly reduce the row distance to the apple at (2, 6).\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#      #\n#  H  A#\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 3) and its body is at (3, 3). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving DOWN is forbidden as it's the reverse of UP.\n\n1.  **UP:** Move to (1, 3). This is a safe empty space. It moves away from the nearest apple at (2, 6).\n2.  **LEFT:** Move to (2, 2). This is a safe empty space. It moves away from all apples.\n3.  **RIGHT:** Move to (2, 4). This is a safe empty space. It moves towards the apple at (2, 6). This seems like the best option to get closer to an apple.\n\nChoosing RIGHT allows the snake to approach the apple at (2, 6).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  SH A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nBased on the current board state and the goal of eating apples while avoiding collisions, the snake is currently moving RIGHT. The head 'H' is at (2, 4) and the body 'S' is at (2, 3). There is an apple 'A' directly to the right at (2, 6). Continuing RIGHT will move the head to (2, 5), which is an empty space and closer to the apple. Moving UP or DOWN would move away from the apples. Reversing direction (LEFT) is not allowed. Therefore, continuing RIGHT is the best move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#   SHA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 4). The body 'S' is at (2, 3). The snake is moving RIGHT.\nThere is an apple 'A' immediately to the right of the head at (2, 5).\nOther apples are at (5, 3) and (6, 6).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  **RIGHT:** Move to (2, 5). This square contains an apple. Eating the apple is good. The snake will grow. New head at (2, 5), body at (2, 4) and (2, 3). This is a valid and beneficial move.\n2.  **UP:** Move to (1, 4). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n3.  **DOWN:** Move to (3, 4). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n4.  **LEFT:** Cannot move LEFT because the current direction is RIGHT (cannot reverse).\n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, increasing the score and length. This is the best strategic move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#      #\n#   SSH#\n# A    #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nBased on the current board state and the snake's position and direction, the snake is at `(2, 6)` (H), `(2, 5)` (S), `(2, 4)` (S) and moving RIGHT.\nPossible moves:\n1.  **UP**: Move to `(1, 6)`. This is an empty space. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN**: Move to `(3, 6)`. This is an empty space. Safe.\n3.  **RIGHT**: Move to `(2, 7)`. This is a wall '#'. Collision. Game Over.\n4.  **LEFT**: Cannot move LEFT because the current direction is RIGHT.\n\nBoth UP and DOWN are safe moves. Moving DOWN positions the snake closer to the apples located at `(3, 1)`, `(5, 2)`, and `(6, 5)`. Moving DOWN to `(3, 6)` allows for potential paths LEFT towards `(3, 1)` or further DOWN towards `(5, 2)` and `(6, 5)`. Moving UP to `(1, 6)` makes accessing the lower apples more complex immediately. Therefore, DOWN seems like a better strategic move to approach the available apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#      #\n#    SS#\n# A   H#\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (3, 6). The body 'S' is at (2, 6) and (2, 5).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible next moves:\n1.  **UP**: Not allowed, as it's the reverse of the current direction (DOWN).\n2.  **DOWN**: Move to (4, 6). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  **LEFT**: Move to (3, 5). This square is occupied by the snake's body 'S'. This would cause a collision.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Move to (3, 7).

The current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so moving UP is not allowed.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (4, 4). This square is empty (' '), so it's a valid move.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (4, 6). This square is a wall ('#'), resulting in a collision. This is not a valid move.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (5, 5). This square is empty (' '), so it's a valid move.\n\nWe need to choose between LEFT and DOWN.\n- Moving DOWN to (5, 5) brings the snake closer to the apple at (6, 5) (one step away) and the apple at (5, 2) (three steps away).\n- Moving LEFT to (4, 4) brings the snake closer to the apple at (5, 2) (three steps away) and the apple at (3, 1) (four steps away).\n\nMoving DOWN positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (6, 5) in the next move. Let's choose the move that heads towards the nearest apple. The apple at (6,5) is closer if we move DOWN first.\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A   S#\n#     S#\n#  A  H#\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 9\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 6).

This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is a valid move.\n4.  UP: Cannot move UP because the current direction is DOWN (reversing direction is not allowed). Invalid move.\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 5) is safe but does not yield an immediate score increase.\n- Moving DOWN to (6, 6) eats an apple, increases the score, and grows the snake. After moving DOWN, the head will be at (6, 6), and the body will be at (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6). The next mandatory move would be LEFT to (6, 5), which is a safe square.\n\nEating the apple is beneficial and safe.

Also, reversing direction is not allowed.\n\nAvailable moves are UP and LEFT.\nChoosing UP (to 5, 4) leads towards apples at (5, 3) and (4, 5).\nChoosing LEFT (to 6, 3) leads towards the apple at (5, 3).\n\nBoth moves are safe and allow access to an apple in the next move. Let's analyze the position after the next move:\n- If UP: Head at (5, 4), direction UP. Can move LEFT to eat apple (5, 3).\n- If LEFT: Head at (6, 3), direction LEFT. Can move UP to eat apple (5, 3).\n\nBoth options lead to the apple at (5,3) in the subsequent move. Moving UP places the snake head slightly more centrally (row 5 vs row 6) and closer to the apple at (4,5) as well.

The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head moves to (4, 5). This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is good. The position is not a wall or the snake's body. This is a safe and productive move.\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (5, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a safe move, but doesn't eat an apple immediately.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (5, 6). This square contains the snake's body ('S'). This leads to a collision and game over. This is an unsafe move.\n\nComparing the safe moves (UP and LEFT), moving UP results in eating an apple immediately, which increases the score and length. This is the primary objective. Moving UP does not put the snake in immediate danger. Therefore, UP is the best move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#    H #\n#  A SS#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 13\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Both UP and LEFT are safe moves that allow the snake to approach apples. Moving LEFT positions the snake slightly more centrally and provides quicker access paths to two different apples ((3,3) and (5,2)) compared to moving UP. Therefore, LEFT is a good strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#   HS #\n#  A S #\n#    SS#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 14\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 4) and its body segments are at (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4).

This positions the snake one step away (LEFT) from the apple at (3, 3). This seems like a good move towards an apple.\n    *   Move LEFT: Head moves to (4, 3). This positions the snake one step away (DOWN) from the space at (5,3), and two steps (DOWN, LEFT) from the apple at (5, 2).\n\n3.  Compare the outcomes:\n    *   Moving UP allows eating the apple at (3, 3) in the subsequent move (LEFT).\n    *   Moving LEFT requires more moves (DOWN, then LEFT) to eat the apple at (5, 2).\n\nMoving UP seems more immediately beneficial as it sets up eating an apple in the next step.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A H  #\n#A  SS #\n#  A S #\n#    SS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 15\n\nThe current position of the snake's head (H) is at row 3, column 4 (using 0-based indexing for the playable area, corresponding to grid coordinates (4, 5)).

Moving LEFT would move the head to (2, 3). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. This move heads towards the apple ('A') at (2, 2). However, if the snake moves LEFT to (2, 3) and then LEFT again to eat the apple at (2, 2), the head will be at (2, 2) moving LEFT. The squares UP (1, 2), DOWN (3, 2), and LEFT (2, 1) will all contain snake body ('S') segments, trapping the snake. So, moving LEFT now leads to a trap in two moves.\n3.  **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would move the head to (2, 5). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. This moves the snake away from the closest apple but into open space.\n4.  **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would move the head to (3, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.

It keeps options open to pursue either apple at (4, 0) or (5, 2).

Let's use 1-based indexing based on the visual representation including walls: Apples at (2, 3), (4, 2), (5, 4). Re-reading the example, the coordinates seem 0-based inside the walls. So, Apples A are at (1, 6) (row 1, col 6 - mistake, it's (2,3)), (4, 1), (5, 3). Okay let's use (row, col) starting from 0 for the playable area 6x6.\n    *   Playable area is rows 1-6, cols 1-6.\n    *   Apples 'A' are at (2, 2), (4, 1), (5, 3).\n    *   Snake body 'S' locations: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5).\n    *   Current direction is LEFT.\n\n2.  **Identify the snake head:** The head 'H' is not explicitly shown. Given the current direction is LEFT, the head must be the 'S' segment from which moving LEFT is possible. Let's assume the longest connected chain represents the snake: S(1,2)-S(1,3)-S(2,3)-S(3,3)? No. Let's try another path. S(4,2)-S(4,3)-S(4,4)-S(3,4)-... This gets complicated with the disjoint 'S'. However, the most plausible interpretation in snake games is that the head is the leading 'S' in the direction of motion. If moving LEFT, the head is likely the leftmost 'S' of the main body. The 'S' at (4, 2) fits this description for a potential connected body like (4,2)->(4,3)->(4,4)->(3,4)->... If the Head is at (4, 2), moving LEFT targets (4, 1).\n\n3.  **Evaluate possible moves:** The current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot move RIGHT. Possible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n    *   **LEFT:** Move to (4, 1). This square contains an apple 'A'. This move is valid (not a wall or self). Eating the apple increases score and length.\n    *   **UP:** Move to (3, 2). This square is empty ' '. This move is valid.\n    *   **DOWN:** Move to (5, 2). This square is empty ' '. This move is valid.\n\n4.  **Choose the best move:**\n    *   Moving LEFT eats an apple immediately. This is generally the primary objective. The position (4,1) is safe. After eating, the head will be at (4,1) and the snake can move UP to (3,1) or DOWN to (5,1).\n    *   Moving UP leads to (3,2). This position is safe but doesn't yield an immediate score.

This leads to game over.\n2. Move DOWN: The head would move to (6, 1), which is an empty space. This is a safe move.\n3. Move RIGHT: The head would move to (5, 2), which is an empty space. This is a safe move. The adjacent square (5, 3) contains an apple 'A'.\n\nMoving RIGHT puts the snake in a position to eat the apple at (5, 3) on the next turn. Moving DOWN moves away from this immediate apple.

I cannot choose LEFT.\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n1.  Check UP: The snake's head is at (5, 2). Moving UP goes to (4, 2). The cell (4, 2) contains 'S' (snake body). This leads to a collision. So, UP is not a valid move.\n2.  Check DOWN: Moving DOWN goes to (6, 2). The cell (6, 2) is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  Check RIGHT: Moving RIGHT goes to (5, 3). The cell (5, 3) contains 'A' (apple). This is a valid move. Eating the apple increases the score and snake length.\n\nComparing valid moves:\n- DOWN: Safe move, but doesn't eat an apple.\n- RIGHT: Eats an apple, increases score and length. Let's check the state after eating the apple. Head moves to (5, 3). The next moves would be from (5, 3) with direction RIGHT. Possible next directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n    - UP: Moves to (4, 3). This cell contains 'S'. Collision.\n    - DOWN: Moves to (6, 3). This cell is empty. Safe.\n    - RIGHT: Moves to (5, 4). This cell is empty.

This is a valid move.\n\nComparing valid moves:\n- Moving DOWN takes the head to (6, 3). This position is further away from the apples.\n- Moving RIGHT takes the head to (5, 4). This position moves the snake closer to the apple at (5, 6). Following this path (RIGHT again, then RIGHT again) leads directly to the apple in 3 steps without immediate collision risk.\n\nChoosing the move that progresses towards the nearest apple is a good strategy.

Moving LEFT is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n\n1.  **Check move RIGHT:** The square to the right (5, 6) contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move, eats an apple, increases the score, and the snake grows. The next position would be head at (5, 6).\n2.  **Check move UP:** The square above (4, 5) is empty. This is a valid move. The snake moves without eating.\n3.  **Check move DOWN:** The square below (6, 5) is empty. This is a valid move. The snake moves without eating.\n\nThe best move is to eat the apple immediately, as it increases the score and doesn't lead to an immediate collision.

Move UP: Head moves to (4, 6). This position is safe. It allows subsequent moves UP towards the apples at (2, 3) and (2, 5). A path exists: UP (4,6) -> UP (3,6) -> UP (2,6) -> LEFT (2,5) to eat an apple.\n2.  Move DOWN: Head moves to (6, 6). This position is safe. However, the next mandatory move would be LEFT (since UP hits the body and DOWN hits the wall). Moving LEFT repeatedly along row 6 might trap the snake against its own body and the bottom wall.\n\nMoving UP is safer and provides a clear path towards the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  A A #\n#  A   #\n#SSSSH #\n#SSSSS #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at coordinates (4, 6) (row 4, column 6, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move DOWN.\nLet's check the other possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, and UP.\n\n1.  Move LEFT: The new head position would be (4, 5). This square is currently occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This move would result in a collision with itself.\n2.  Move RIGHT: The new head position would be (4, 7). This square is a wall ('#'). This move would result in a collision with the wall.\n3.  Move UP: The new head position would be (3, 6). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid and safe move.\n\nSince LEFT and RIGHT lead to collisions, the only possible move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  A A #\n#  A H #\n#SSS S #\n#SSSSS #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 4). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving DOWN is not allowed as it reverses the current direction.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The position is (2, 4). This square contains an apple ('A'). This move is valid (not a wall or self-collision) and results in eating an apple.\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The position is (3, 3). This square is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The position is (3, 5). This square is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which increases the score and length. This is generally the preferred action in Snake if safe. Let's check if moving UP is safe in the subsequent step.\nIf the snake moves UP, the head will be at (2, 4), and the body will occupy (3, 4) and the rest of the current body positions. The direction will remain UP. From (2, 4), the snake can move UP to (1, 4), LEFT to (2, 3), or RIGHT to (2, 5). All these positions are empty and safe.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to eat the apple is the best move.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#      #\n#  A H #\n# AA S #\n#SSS S #\n#SSSSS #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 35\n\nYour current position (Head 'H') is at row 2, column 5.\nYour current direction is UP.\nThe possible moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. You cannot move DOWN as it's the reverse of UP.\n\n1.  Check move RIGHT: Position (2, 6) is a wall ('#'). This move leads to game over.\n2.  Check move UP: Position (1, 5) is empty (' '). This is a valid move. The board state would change, moving the head up and the tail following. This moves away from the nearest apples.\n3.  Check move LEFT: Position (2, 4) is empty (' '). This is a valid move. This move brings the head closer to the apple at (2, 2).\n\nComparing valid moves UP and LEFT:\n- Moving UP takes the snake to (1, 5), further away from the apples located at (2, 2), (3, 1), and (3, 2).\n- Moving LEFT takes the snake to (2, 4), one step closer to the apple cluster. From (2, 4), two more LEFT moves would reach the apple at (2, 2).\n\nMoving LEFT is strategically better as it is a safe move that directly progresses towards the nearest group of apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  AHS #\n# AA S #\n#SS  S #\n#SSSSS #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 36\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (3, 3) (row 3, column 3, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot move RIGHT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (2, 3). This square contains an apple 'A'. This move is valid (not a wall, not the snake's body). Eating the apple increases the score and snake length.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (4, 3). This square contains part of the snake's body 'S'. This move is invalid (collision with self).\n3.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (3, 2). This square contains an apple 'A'. This move is valid (not a wall, not the snake's body). Eating the apple increases the score and snake length.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are valid moves that result in eating an apple. Let's analyze the situation after each move:\n- If moving UP: Head at (2, 3). Next possible moves from (2, 3) are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (all into empty space).\n- If moving LEFT: Head at (3, 2). Next possible moves from (3, 2) are LEFT (to another apple 'A' at (3,1)), UP (to empty space at (2,2)), or DOWN (collision with 'S' at (4,2)).\n\nMoving UP positions the snake's head towards a more open area at the top of the board, offering more movement options in the subsequent step. Moving LEFT leads to another apple immediately but might constrain movement options faster. Therefore, moving UP is a slightly better strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#   H  #\n#  ASS #\n# AA S #\n#S   S #\n#SSSSS #\n#      #\n########\n```\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake's head is at coordinates (4, 1) (assuming 0-based indexing from the top-left corner within the walls).\nThe possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and UP. The snake cannot move DOWN because that would be reversing its direction.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (4, 0). This position contains a wall '#'. This leads to a game over.\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (3, 1). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (5, 1). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT are safe moves. The apples are located at (2, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3). Moving LEFT positions the snake's head at (3, 1), which is closer to the apples compared to moving RIGHT (which would place the head at (5, 1)). Therefore, moving LEFT is the better strategic choice to approach the apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#  HS  #\n#  ASS #\n# AA S #\n#    S #\n#SSSSS #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 38\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (1, 3).

This is a safe move but does not immediately yield points.\n-   **DOWN**: Moves to a square with an apple. This is a safe move, eats an apple, increases the score by 1, and increases the snake's length. This directly contributes to the game's goal.\n\nChoosing DOWN leads to eating an apple, which is beneficial.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#  SS A#\n#  HSS #\n# AA S #\n#    S #\n#SSSSS #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 39\n\nMy analysis:\n1.  The snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 2).\n2.  The current direction is DOWN.\n3.  The snake cannot reverse direction, so moving UP is not allowed.\n4.  Moving RIGHT: The position (3, 3) contains 'S' (snake body). This move leads to a collision.\n5.  Moving LEFT: The position (3, 1) is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n6.  Moving DOWN: The position (4, 2) contains 'A' (apple). This is a valid move, and the snake will eat the apple, grow longer, and increase the score.\n\nComparing valid moves:\n-   LEFT: Safe move, leads to an empty space.\n-   DOWN: Safe move, leads to eating an apple.\n\nStrategy consideration: Eating apples is the objective alongside survival. Moving DOWN achieves this immediately. Let's check the consequences of moving DOWN:\n-   The head moves to (4, 2). An apple is eaten.\n-   The snake grows. The old head position (3, 2) becomes 'S'. The tail position (5, 2) remains 'S'.\n-   The next state's head will be at (4, 2), and the direction will still be DOWN.\n-   From (4, 2), the possible moves will be LEFT (to 4, 1 - empty), RIGHT (to 4, 3 - apple), or DOWN (to 5, 2 - body collision).\n-   If the snake moves DOWN, it must then choose LEFT or RIGHT. Choosing RIGHT leads to eating another apple at (4, 3), but the subsequent moves from (4, 3) (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) all lead to collisions with the body. Therefore, after moving DOWN to (4, 2), the only safe next move is LEFT to (4, 1).\n\nSince moving DOWN allows eating an apple and there's a safe subsequent move (LEFT), moving DOWN is the preferred action.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#  SS A#\n#  SSS #\n# AH S #\n#    SA#\n#SSSSS #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 40\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Check collisions for each possible move:\n    *   Move LEFT: New head position (3, 1). This square contains an apple ('A'). This move is valid and results in eating an apple.\n    *   Move RIGHT: New head position (3, 3). This square contains the snake's body ('S').

Moving LEFT is safe (doesn't hit a wall or the snake's body) and allows the snake to eat an apple.\n2.  **Check UP:** The square at (2, 2) is empty ('.'). Moving UP is safe.\n3.  **Check DOWN:** The square at (4, 2) is empty ('.'). Moving DOWN is safe.\n\nSince the goal is to eat apples, and moving LEFT allows eating an apple immediately and safely, LEFT is the best move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  SS A#\n#  SSS #\n#HSS S #\n#   ASA#\n#SSSSS #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1.  **UP:** The snake head 'H' is at (3, 1).

This move is valid.\n3.  **LEFT:** Moving LEFT would place the head at (3, 0). This square contains a wall ('#'). This move leads to a collision and game over.\n4.  **RIGHT:** The current direction is LEFT. Moving RIGHT is reversing direction, which is not allowed.\n\nWe must choose between UP and DOWN. Let's explore the consequences briefly:\n*   **If UP:** Head moves to (2, 1). New direction is UP. The snake is now in a tight vertical corridor (column 1) with its body below it. The next moves would likely be UP again to (1, 1), then forced RIGHT to (1, 2), then forced DOWN to (2, 2), which quickly leads into the snake's own body (e.g., trying to move right from (2,2) hits S(2,3)). This path seems dangerous and likely leads to a trap.\n*   **If DOWN:** Head moves to (4, 1). New direction is DOWN. The snake moves towards the lower part of the board. From (4, 1), the snake could move DOWN again to (5, 1) (safe, as the tail at (5,1) would vacate), or RIGHT to (4, 2) (safe). Moving DOWN opens up the bottom rows, and moving RIGHT from (4,1) could lead towards the apples at (4,4) and (4,6). A path exists: DOWN -> RIGHT -> RIGHT -> RIGHT to eat the apple at (4,4). However, analysis shows this leads to an immediate trap after eating. Alternatively, DOWN -> DOWN -> DOWN -> RIGHT... leads safely towards the apple at (4,6) and potentially the apple at (1,6) afterwards. This path seems much safer and more promising.\n\nComparing the options, moving DOWN offers a safer path with access to apples, while moving UP seems to lead into a confined space and potential self-collision quickly. Therefore, DOWN is the better move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#  SS A#\n#  SSS #\n#SSS S #\n#H  ASA#\n# SSSS #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 43\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 1).

Identify the snake's head position: (5, 1).\n2.  Identify the current direction: DOWN.\n3.  Determine valid moves: The snake cannot move UP (reverse of DOWN). The possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN.\n4.  Evaluate LEFT: The position (5, 0) is a wall ('#'). This move leads to collision. Invalid.\n5.  Evaluate DOWN: The position (6, 1) is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n6.  Evaluate RIGHT: The position (5, 2) is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n7.  Compare valid moves (DOWN and RIGHT):\n    *   Moving DOWN to (6, 1): The snake enters the last row. The only subsequent move from (6, 1) would be RIGHT to (6, 2).\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (5, 2): The snake stays in row 5. Subsequent moves from (5, 2) could be UP to (4, 2) or DOWN to (6, 2). Moving UP to (4, 2) would allow a subsequent move RIGHT to (4, 3) to eat an apple.\n8.  Conclusion: Moving RIGHT keeps more options open and provides a clearer path towards the nearest apples located at (4, 3) and (4, 5).

This square contains an apple ('A'). If the snake eats this apple, its head will be at (4, 3), and the old head position (5, 3) will become part of the body ('S'). The snake's current direction would be UP. The next possible moves would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (cannot move DOWN).\n    *   Moving UP from (4, 3) goes to (3, 3), which contains 'S'.

Collision.\n    Therefore, moving UP leads to a situation where the snake is trapped and will collide on the next move. This move is not viable for survival.\n\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move from (5, 3) to (6, 3). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. The snake does not eat an apple, but it survives. The new direction will be DOWN.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT:** The current direction is RIGHT. Moving LEFT is reversing direction, which is not allowed.\n\n4.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move from (5, 3) to (5, 4). This square contains a part of the snake's body ('S'). This would result in a collision. This move is not valid.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only safe move that allows the snake to survive is DOWN.

This move leads to a collision.\n4.  **DOWN:** This move is not allowed because the current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction.\n\nThe only valid and non-fatal move is UP. Moving UP also allows the snake to eat an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#  SS A#\n#  SSS #\n#SSS   #\n#SS H A#\n# SSSA #\n#  SS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 50\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 4).\nThe current direction is UP.\nIf the snake continues UP, it will move to (3, 4), which is occupied by its body ('S'). This results in a collision.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN because it's the reverse of the current direction (UP).\nThe snake can move LEFT or RIGHT.\nIf the snake moves LEFT, it will move to (4, 3), which is occupied by its body ('S'). This results in a collision.\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, it will move to (4, 5), which is an empty space (' '). This move is safe and moves towards the apple at (4, 6).\n\nTherefore, the only safe move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#  SS A#\n#  SS  #\n#SSS   #\n#SS SHA#\n# SSSA #\n#  SS  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 51\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 6). The current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move to (3, 6). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  DOWN: Move to (5, 6). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move. Eating the apple will increase the score and snake length.\n3.  LEFT: Move to (4, 5). This square contains a snake body part ('S'). This move is invalid due to collision with self. Also, the snake cannot reverse direction (RIGHT to LEFT).\n4.  RIGHT: Move to (4, 7). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move. Eating the apple will increase the score and snake length.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT lead to eating an apple and are valid moves. Let's evaluate the positions after eating.\n- If move DOWN: Head moves to (5, 6). Direction becomes DOWN. Subsequent moves possible: LEFT (collision with S at 5,5), RIGHT (to 5,7, empty), DOWN (to 6,6, empty). Safe options available.\n- If move RIGHT: Head moves to (4, 7). Direction becomes RIGHT. Subsequent moves possible: UP (to 3,7, empty), DOWN (to 5,7, empty), RIGHT (to 4,8, wall collision). Safe options available.\n\nBoth options seem good as they lead to eating an apple and have safe subsequent moves. Let's choose to move DOWN to eat the apple at (5, 6).\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#  SS A#\n#  SS  #\n#SSSA  #\n#SS SSA#\n# SSSH #\n#  SS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 52\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves for the snake head 'H' located at coordinates (5, 6) (row 5, column 6, 0-indexed). The current direction is DOWN.\n\n1.  **Attempt to move LEFT:** The snake's head would move to (5, 5). The character at (5, 5) is 'S' (snake body). This would result in a collision. Therefore, LEFT is not a valid move.\n2.  **Attempt to move RIGHT:** The snake's head would move to (5, 7). The character at (5, 7) is '#' (wall). This would result in a collision. Therefore, RIGHT is not a valid move.\n3.  **Attempt to move UP:** The current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot reverse its direction directly. Therefore, UP is not a valid move.\n4.  **Attempt to move DOWN:** The snake's head would move to (6, 6). The character at (6, 6) is ' ' (empty space). This is a valid move.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only valid move the snake can make without causing a collision or breaking the rules is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#  SS A#\n#  S   #\n#SSSA  #\n#SS SSA#\n# SSSS #\n#  SSH #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 53\n\nAnalyzing the possible moves:\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (6, 6).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP because that would be reversing direction.\nThe possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The cell at (6, 5) contains 'S' (snake body). Moving LEFT would result in a collision with the snake's own body. Game Over.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The cell at (6, 7) contains '#' (wall). Moving RIGHT would result in a collision with the wall.

Eating the apple increases the score and snake length.\n\nEating an apple is the primary goal. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SHA #\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nI need to choose the next direction for the snake. The snake's head 'H' is at (4, 4), and its body 'S' is at (4, 3). The current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot move LEFT (reversing direction).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move to (3, 4). This square is empty (' '). It is a valid move.\n2.  DOWN: Move to (5, 4). This square is empty (' '). It is a valid move.\n3.  RIGHT: Move to (4, 5). This square contains an apple ('A'). It is a valid move. Eating the apple will increase the snake's length and score.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Moving UP or DOWN keeps the snake alive but doesn't immediately increase the score.\n- Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple at (4, 5), increasing the score and length. This is the primary objective. After eating the apple, the snake's head will be at (4, 5), and its body will occupy (4, 4) and (4, 3). This move is safe and productive.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SSHA#\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 6).

RIGHT: Move to (4, 7). This square contains an apple 'A'. Valid move, eats the apple.\n4.  LEFT: Invalid move, as the snake cannot reverse direction (current direction is RIGHT).\n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple at (4, 7) immediately, increasing the score and length. This move is safe as (4, 7) is not a wall or part of the snake's body.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# ASSSH#\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 6) and it is moving RIGHT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\nMoving LEFT is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (3, 6). This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.\n2.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (5, 6). This is an empty space, so it's a valid move. This position is adjacent to the apple at (5, 5).\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (4, 7). This is a wall ('#'), leading to a game over.\n\nComparing UP and DOWN: Moving DOWN positions the snake right next to an apple at (5, 5), making it possible to eat it in the next step by moving LEFT. Moving UP moves the snake away from the closest apples. Therefore, DOWN is the better strategic move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A SSS#\n#    AH#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 6). The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN (cannot move UP as it's the reverse direction).\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (5, 5). This cell contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move. The snake eats the apple, grows, and the score increases.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (5, 7). This cell is a wall ('#'). This is an invalid move (collision).\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (6, 6). This cell is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nThe best move is to eat the apple. Moving LEFT achieves this.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# AASSS#\n#    HS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5, 4). The current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake's body parts are at (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), and (5, 5).\nApples are at (1, 2), (4, 1), and (4, 2).\n\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, and DOWN (cannot move RIGHT as it's the reverse of LEFT).\n\n1.  **Check UP:** Moving UP would take the head to (4, 4). This position is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This move results in a collision and game over.\n2.  **Check LEFT:** Moving LEFT would take the head to (5, 3). This position is empty ('.'). This is a valid move.\n3.  **Check DOWN:** Moving DOWN would take the head to (6, 4). This position is empty ('.'). This is a valid move.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are safe moves. Strategically, moving LEFT brings the snake closer to the two apples located at (4, 1) and (4, 2). After moving LEFT to (5, 3), the snake can potentially move UP towards these apples in the subsequent turn. Moving DOWN moves the snake away from these apples and closer to the bottom wall. Therefore, LEFT is the better strategic move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# AA SS#\n#   HSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake head 'H' is at coordinates (5, 3). The body 'S' occupies (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6). The apples 'A' are at (1, 2), (4, 1), and (4, 2). The current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move head to (4, 3). This square is empty and not a wall. It's a valid move.\n2.  DOWN: Move head to (6, 3). This square is empty and not a wall. It's a valid move.\n3.  LEFT: Move head to (5, 2). This square is empty and not a wall. It's a valid move.\n\nEvaluating the moves:\n- The nearest apples are at (4, 1) and (4, 2). The closest is (4, 2), which is 2 steps away (e.g., UP then LEFT, or LEFT then UP).\n- Moving DOWN takes the snake further away from the nearest apples.\n- Moving UP to (4, 3) positions the snake to eat the apple at (4, 2) in the next step by moving LEFT.\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 2) positions the snake to eat the apple at (4, 2) in the next step by moving UP.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are good moves leading directly towards the nearest apple. Moving UP leads to position (4, 3). Moving LEFT leads to position (5, 2). Both allow eating the apple at (4, 2) on the subsequent move. Both paths appear safe and allow subsequent moves towards the apple at (4, 1). Choosing UP seems slightly more direct towards the cluster of two apples.\n\nTherefore, I choose UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# AAH S#\n#   SSS#\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 5). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n1.  Move UP: Head moves to (3, 5). This is an empty square. Valid.\n2.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (4, 4). This is an empty square. Valid.\n3.  Move RIGHT: Head moves to (4, 6). This square is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). Invalid (collision).\n4.  Move DOWN: Cannot reverse direction from UP. Invalid.\n\nThe valid moves are UP and LEFT.\nChoosing LEFT moves the snake's head to (4, 4), closer to the two adjacent apples at (4, 2) and (4, 3). This seems like a good strategy to eat them quickly.\nChoosing UP moves the snake's head to (3, 5), towards the apple at (1, 3).\n\nMoving LEFT allows potentially eating two apples in the next two moves (LEFT, LEFT). Let's choose LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# AHS S#\n#  ASSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 3). The current direction is LEFT.\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n1.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (4, 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  Move UP: The head would move to (3, 3). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (5, 3). This square is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This is an invalid move (collision with self).\n4.  Move RIGHT: This is not allowed as it's the reverse of the current direction (LEFT).\n\nWe have two valid moves: LEFT and UP.\nLet's evaluate them:\n- Moving LEFT to (4, 2) brings the snake closer to the apple at (4, 1) (distance 1) and the apple at (5, 2) (distance 1).\n- Moving UP to (3, 3) moves the snake away from the apples at (4, 1) and (5, 2), but closer to the apple at (1, 2).\n\nMoving LEFT is strategically better as it positions the snake to potentially eat one of the two closer apples in the next step.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current Game Board:\n########\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n# HSS S#\n#  ASSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent snake head position: (4, 1) (row 4, col 1)\nCurrent snake body positions: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3)\nApples positions: (1, 2), (2, 2), (5, 2)\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so moving RIGHT is not allowed.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible moves:\n1.  Move LEFT: The snake head would move to (4, 0). This position is a wall ('#'). This move leads to a collision and game over.\n2.  Move UP: The snake head would move to (3, 1). This position is empty (' '). This move is safe (no collision with walls or self).\n3.  Move DOWN: The snake head would move to (5, 1). This position is empty (' '). This move is safe (no collision with walls or self).\n\nComparing UP and DOWN:\n- Moving UP positions the snake towards the apples at (1, 2) and (2, 2).\n- Moving DOWN positions the snake adjacent to the apple at (5, 2). The snake could eat this apple in the next turn by moving RIGHT.\n\nEating an apple increases the score and snake length. A greedy strategy suggests moving towards the nearest reachable apple. Moving DOWN allows the snake to eat the apple at (5, 2) in the subsequent move. This seems like a productive and safe move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n# HASSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nAnalyze possible moves:\n1.  Turn UP: Invalid move, opposite to current direction DOWN.\n2.  Turn LEFT: The snake head 'H' at (5, 2) would move to (5, 1). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  Turn RIGHT: The snake head 'H' at (5, 2) would move to (5, 3). This square is occupied by the snake body ('S'). This move leads to a collision. Invalid move.\n4.  Continue DOWN: The snake head 'H' at (5, 2) would move to (6, 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nValid moves are LEFT and DOWN.\n\nStrategy:\nThe apples 'A' are located at (1, 3) and (2, 3). The snake needs to move upwards to reach them.\n- If the snake moves LEFT to (5, 1), the next possible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN. Moving UP is possible and directly towards the apples' general direction.\n- If the snake moves DOWN to (6, 2), the next possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. Moving DOWN hits the wall. Moving RIGHT to (6, 3) is safe. Moving LEFT to (6, 1) is safe. From (6, 2), turning LEFT (to 6,1) and then UP (to 5,1) takes two moves to reach the same column as the initial LEFT move, but one row lower. Turning RIGHT (to 6,3) makes it difficult to immediately turn UP due to the body at (5,3).\n\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to potentially move UP in the next step, which seems a more direct path towards the apples compared to moving DOWN first.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n#HSASS #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 1). The current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The square at (5, 0) is a wall '#'. This leads to a collision.\n2.  **Move UP:** The square at (4, 1) is empty ' '. This is a valid move. The snake head will move to (4, 1).\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The square at (6, 1) is empty ' '. This is a valid move. The snake head will move to (6, 1).\n\nEvaluating valid moves:\n-   Moving UP positions the snake to potentially move towards the apples at (1, 3) and (2, 3). The next move options from (4, 1) would be UP (to 3, 1) or RIGHT (to 4, 2 - collision) or LEFT (to 4, 0 - wall). So only UP is safe after moving UP.\n-   Moving DOWN positions the snake in the bottom row. The next move options from (6, 1) would be DOWN (to 7, 1 - wall), RIGHT (to 6, 2 - safe), or LEFT (to 6, 0 - wall). So only RIGHT is safe after moving DOWN.\n\nMoving UP seems strategically better as it heads towards the area with apples and allows further upward movement. Moving DOWN leads to the bottom row with only one safe exit (RIGHT), potentially boxing the snake in later.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#HSSS  #\n#SSAS  #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 13\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\nThe snake's head is at (4, 1).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\nMoving LEFT would cause a collision with the wall at (4, 0).\nMoving RIGHT would cause a collision with the snake's body at (4, 2).\nMoving UP would move the head to (3, 1), which is an empty space. This is the only safe move.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n#H     #\n#SSSS  #\n#SSA   #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 14\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head is at (3, 1). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is forbidden as it's the reverse direction).\n1.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (3, 0), which is a wall ('#'). This leads to game over.\n2.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (3, 2), which is an empty space. This is a valid move.\n3.  Move UP: The head would move to (2, 1), which is an empty space. This is a valid move.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe moves. Moving UP takes the snake to (2, 1), closer to the apples at (1, 3) and (2, 3). Moving RIGHT takes the snake to (3, 2), also positioning it to move towards the apples. Moving UP seems a direct path towards the upper apples.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#  A   #\n#H A   #\n#S     #\n#SSS   #\n#SSA   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 15\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  The snake head 'H' is at (2, 1).\n2.  The current direction is UP.\n3.  The snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\n4.  Possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n5.  Check collisions for possible moves:\n    *   UP: Move to (1, 1). This is an empty space. Safe.\n    *   LEFT: Move to (2, 0). This is a wall '#'. Collision. Invalid.\n    *   RIGHT: Move to (2, 2). This is an empty space. Safe.\n6.  Evaluate safe moves:\n    *   Move UP: Head goes to (1, 1). The snake is positioned higher. To eat the nearest apples at (1, 3) or (2, 3), the snake would need to turn RIGHT. Eating A(1,3) requires UP -> RIGHT -> RIGHT.\n    *   Move RIGHT: Head goes to (2, 2). The snake is positioned next to the apple at (2, 3). The next move RIGHT would eat this apple. This seems more direct.\n7.  Consider the path after moving RIGHT:\n    *   Move RIGHT: H at (2, 2), Direction RIGHT.\n    *   Move RIGHT: H at (2, 3) (eats apple A). Direction RIGHT.\n    *   Move UP: H at (1, 3) (eats apple A). Direction UP.\n    *   This sequence eats two apples quickly. Need to check for traps. After H(1,3) (Dir UP), the snake body occupies (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), etc. Moving LEFT from H(1,3) leads to H(1,2). Moving LEFT again leads to H(1,1). Moving DOWN leads to H(2,1), which is occupied by the body segment that was previously at (2,2). However, if after H(1,3) (Dir UP), the snake moves RIGHT to H(1,4), it avoids this trap and can proceed towards the last apple A(5,3).\n8.  Conclusion: Moving RIGHT is a safe move, leads directly to eating an apple on the next turn, and has a viable path forward to eat the other apples without immediate self-collision if navigated correctly.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#SHA   #\n#S     #\n#SS    #\n#SSA   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at coordinates (2, 2) (row 2, column 2, 0-indexed inside the walls).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake's body (S) occupies squares (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 2).\nApples (A) are at (1, 3), (2, 4), (5, 5).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move to (1, 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. It moves towards the apple at (1, 3).\n2.  DOWN: Move to (3, 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. It moves away from the apples.\n3.  RIGHT: Move to (2, 3). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. It moves towards the apple at (2, 4) and positions the head adjacent to the apple at (1, 3).\n4.  LEFT: Cannot move LEFT because the current direction is RIGHT (reversing direction is not allowed).\n\nEvaluating the valid moves:\n- UP: Safe. Moves towards apple (1, 3). Next move would likely be RIGHT to eat it.\n- DOWN: Safe. Moves away from apples. The subsequent moves might become restricted (e.g., next forced move would be RIGHT).\n- RIGHT: Safe. Moves towards apple (2, 4) and positions the head next to apple (1, 3). This gives immediate options to eat either apple in the next step.\n\nComparing UP and RIGHT, both are good moves leading towards apples. RIGHT positions the snake more advantageously with respect to two nearby apples. Therefore, moving RIGHT is a slightly better strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#  A   #\n#SSH   #\n#S     #\n#SS    #\n#SSA   #\n#A     #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 17\n\nSnake Head: (2, 5)\nSnake Body: (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)\nApples: (1, 3), (5, 5), (6, 1)\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT.

Safe move.\n    *   This moves away from the closest apples initially but keeps options open.\n\nComparing UP and DOWN:\n*   Going UP towards A1 (1,3) is possible. After eating A1 at (1,3) via UP->LEFT->LEFT, the head would be at (1,3), and the body would occupy (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,1). From (1,3), UP is wall, DOWN (2,3) is body, RIGHT (1,4) is body. Only LEFT (1,2) is possible, which might be restrictive.\n*   Going DOWN towards A2 (5,5) is possible. After eating A2 at (5,5) via DOWN->DOWN->DOWN, the head would be at (5,5), and the body would occupy (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,1), (5,2). From (5,5), UP (4,5) is body. DOWN (6,5) is safe. LEFT (5,4) is safe. RIGHT (5,6) is safe. This path leaves more options open and leads towards A3 (6,1).\n\nMoving DOWN seems the better strategy as it leads directly to an apple (A2) and leaves more maneuvering room afterwards, potentially allowing access to A3.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#  A   #\n#SSS   #\n#S H   #\n#S     #\n#SSA   #\n#A     #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 18\n\nMy analysis:\n1.

Comparing valid moves (RIGHT and DOWN):\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (3, 4) is safe but doesn't immediately approach an apple.\n    *   Moving DOWN to (4, 3) is safe and moves the snake closer to the apple at (5, 3). The next move DOWN from (4, 3) would eat the apple.\n9.  Moving towards the nearest apple is generally a good strategy.

The new direction is UP. Possible next moves from (4, 6) would be UP (to 3, 6 - empty), LEFT (to 4, 5 - empty), or RIGHT (to 4, 7 - wall). This path keeps the snake alive and allows maneuvering towards the apples at (1, 3) and (2, 5).\n*   If we move DOWN: The head moves to (6, 6). The new direction is DOWN. Possible next moves from (6, 6) would be LEFT (to 6, 5 - body 'S'), RIGHT (to 6, 7 - wall '#'), or DOWN (to 7, 6 - wall '#'). All possible next moves lead to a collision.

Analyze valid moves for proximity to apples:\n    *   Apple locations: (1, 2), (2, 4), (6, 0).\n    *   Moving UP to (2, 5): Puts the head one step away (LEFT) from the apple at (2, 4).\n    *   Moving LEFT to (3, 4): Puts the head one step away (UP) from the apple at (2, 4).\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (3, 6): Puts the head further from the closest apple (2, 4). Requires UP, LEFT, LEFT.\n6.  Compare the best options (UP and LEFT):\n    *   Both UP and LEFT position the snake one move away from the apple at (2, 4).\n    *   Moving UP aligns with the current direction and moves towards the upper area where two apples are located ((1, 2) and (2, 4)). This seems slightly strategically better than moving LEFT.\n    *   Consider the state after moving UP to (2, 5). The next move would likely be LEFT to (2, 4) to eat the apple.

Conclusion: Moving UP is a safe move that positions the snake optimally to eat the nearest apple in the following turn.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#   AH #\n#    S #\n#  S S #\n#  SSS #\n#A SS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 6).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move DOWN.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (1, 6). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (2, 5). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (2, 7). This square is a wall ('#'). This move leads to collision and game over.\n\nWe need to choose between UP and LEFT.\n- If we move UP, the head will be at (1, 6). The nearest apple is at (1, 3), 3 steps to the LEFT.\n- If we move LEFT, the head will be at (2, 5). The nearest apple is at (2, 4), 1 step to the LEFT.\n\nMoving LEFT brings the snake closer to an apple and allows eating it in the next step. Let's check if moving LEFT leads to an immediate trap.\nIf the snake moves LEFT, the head goes to (2, 5), the direction becomes LEFT. The next possible moves are UP (to 1, 5), DOWN (to 3, 5 - body collision!), or LEFT (to 2, 4 - eat apple). Moving LEFT again to eat the apple at (2, 4) seems safe and beneficial.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#  A   #\n#   HS #\n#    SA#\n#  S S #\n#  SSS #\n#A SS  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 28\n\nBased on the current board state and the rules:\n1.  The snake's head is at (3, 4).\n2.  The current direction is LEFT.\n3.  Possible next moves are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. Moving RIGHT is invalid as it reverses the current direction.\n4.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (3, 3). This is a safe square (empty space).\n5.  Move UP: Head moves to (2, 4). This is a safe square (empty space).\n6.  Move DOWN: Head moves to (4, 4). This is a safe square (empty space).\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n-   Moving LEFT (to 3, 3): This moves the snake away from the apple at (4, 6) but closer to the apples at (1, 3) and (6, 1). From (3, 3), the next move DOWN would lead to a collision with the snake body at (4, 3).\n-   Moving UP (to 2, 4): This moves the snake towards the apple at (1, 3). From (2, 4), subsequent moves UP, LEFT, or RIGHT seem safe initially and provide access towards the apple at (1, 3).\n-   Moving DOWN (to 4, 4): This moves the snake towards the apple at (4, 6). However, from (4, 4), subsequent moves LEFT (to 4, 3) or RIGHT (to 4, 5) would lead to immediate collisions with the snake's body. Only moving DOWN again would be possible initially, potentially leading to a trap.\n\nConsidering safety and access to apples, moving UP seems the best option as it moves towards an apple and maintains flexibility for future moves without immediate collision risks on the next turn.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#  AH  #\n#   SS #\n#    SA#\n#    S #\n#  SSS #\n#A SS  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 4). The current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN because it cannot reverse direction.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The square above the head (0, 4) is a wall ('#'). Moving UP results in a collision. Invalid move.\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The square to the left of the head (1, 3) contains an apple ('A'). Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat the apple, grow, and increase the score. Valid move.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The square to the right of the head (1, 5) is empty (' '). Moving RIGHT is a valid move.\n\nTo maximize the score, eating the apple is desirable. Moving LEFT achieves this. Let's check if moving LEFT leads to an immediate dead end. If the snake moves LEFT, the head will be at (1, 3), and the new direction will be LEFT. The next possible moves would be UP (wall, invalid), DOWN (empty, valid), or LEFT (empty, valid). Since there are valid moves after eating the apple, moving LEFT is a good strategy.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  HS  #\n#   SS #\n#    SA#\n# A  S #\n#  SSS #\n#A SS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1.  **UP:** The snake's head is at (1, 3).

Invalid move.\n    *   **Move DOWN:** The square below the head (2, 3) is (3, 3). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n6.  **Choose the Best Valid Move (LEFT or DOWN):**\n    *   Both LEFT and DOWN are safe moves for the next step.\n    *   Consider apple locations: (3, 6), (4, 1), (6, 0).\n    *   Moving LEFT (to 2, 2): Head is closer to apples at (4, 1) and (6, 0) horizontally.\n    *   Moving DOWN (to 3, 3): Head is closer to apples at (4, 1) and (6, 0) vertically.\n    *   Consider available space after the move:\n        *   Moving LEFT to (2, 2): The next possible moves would be LEFT, DOWN. UP is blocked by 'S' at (1, 2).\n        *   Moving DOWN to (3, 3): The next possible moves would be LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. This offers more immediate options.\n    *   Moving DOWN keeps the snake generally heading towards the lower section of the board where two apples are located (A at 4,1 and A at 6,0). It also maintains more immediate directional flexibility.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Moving DOWN is a safe move that positions the snake reasonably well towards the apples and offers more immediate movement options compared to moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#  SS  #\n#  SSS #\n#  H SA#\n# A  S #\n#   SS #\n#A  S  #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 3) (using 0-based indexing from the top-left corner inside the walls).

Let's check safety: After moving LEFT, the head will be at (4, 1), and the square (4, 2) will become 'S'. The snake will be longer. From (4, 1), the snake can move UP to (3, 1) or DOWN to (5, 1). It cannot move LEFT (wall) or RIGHT (collision with new 'S' at (4, 2)). Moving LEFT seems safe for the next step and achieves the goal of eating an apple.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#  SS  #\n#  SSS #\n#  S SA#\n# HS S #\n#   SS #\n#A A   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1.  **Continue LEFT:** The snake's head 'H' is at (4, 1). Moving LEFT would lead to (4, 0), which is a wall '#'. This results in a collision and game over.\n2.  **Turn RIGHT:** The current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so turning RIGHT is an invalid move.\n3.  **Turn UP:** Moving UP would move the head 'H' from (4, 1) to (3, 1). This square is currently empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n4.  **Turn DOWN:** Moving DOWN would move the head 'H' from (4, 1) to (5, 1). This square is currently empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n\nWe need to choose between UP and DOWN.\n- Moving UP positions the head at (3, 1). The space around it is somewhat limited by the snake's body and the wall.\n- Moving DOWN positions the head at (5, 1). This move brings the snake closer to the two apples 'A' located at (6, 0) and (6, 2). From (5, 1), the snake has open paths towards these apples (DOWN to (6,1) or RIGHT to (5,2)).\n\nStrategically, moving DOWN appears to be the better option as it provides clear paths towards the nearby apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#  SS  #\n#  SSS #\n#  S SA#\n# SS S #\n# H  S #\n#A A   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\n- The snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 1) (row 5, column 1).\n- The current direction is DOWN.\n- Possible next moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (cannot move UP).\n- Moving LEFT would hit the wall at (5, 0).\n- Moving RIGHT would hit the snake's body 'S' at (5, 2).\n- Moving DOWN would move the head to (6, 1), which contains an apple 'A'.

This square contains 'S' (part of the snake's body). This move results in a collision.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The current direction is UP, so moving DOWN is not allowed as it reverses the direction.\n3.  **Move LEFT:** The snake's head would move to position (5, 0). This square contains '#' (a wall). This move results in a collision.\n4.  **Move RIGHT:** The snake's head would move to position (5, 2). This square contains 'S' (part of the snake's body). This move results in a collision.\n\nAll permissible moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) lead to an immediate collision, resulting in a game over. Since a move must be chosen, and none can prevent the game from ending, any of the allowed moves could be selected.

This path seems to offer slightly more maneuvering room initially compared to moving UP, although the board is very crowded.\n\nConsidering the tight space, moving RIGHT provides access to a slightly larger immediate area (5 squares reachable: (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)) compared to moving UP (4 squares reachable: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)).

This is also a safe square (empty space).\n\nStrategically, there are apples located at (3, 6), (4, 6), and (6, 3). Moving RIGHT positions the snake towards the apples on the right side of the board. Moving LEFT moves the snake away from the apples. Therefore, moving RIGHT is the better option to pursue the objective of eating apples.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n# SH   #\n# S    #\n#SSS  A#\n#SSS  A#\n#SS    #\n#SSA   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 44\n\n1.  **Identify Snake Head and Body:** The head 'H' is at position (1, 3) (row 1, column 3, using 0-based indexing inside the walls). The body 'S' occupies several squares, including (1, 2), (2, 2), etc.\n2.  **Identify Current Direction:** The snake is moving RIGHT.\n3.  **Determine Possible Moves:**\n    *   **UP:** The snake cannot move UP to (0, 3) because it would hit the wall '#'. Also, moving UP would reverse the component of motion relative to the segment behind it at (1, 2), which is generally disallowed unless length is 1 (not the case here).\n    *   **DOWN:** The snake can move DOWN to position (2, 3). This square is currently empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n    *   **LEFT:** The snake cannot move LEFT because the current direction is RIGHT (snakes cannot reverse direction 180 degrees).\n    *   **RIGHT:** The snake can move RIGHT to position (1, 4). This square is currently empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n4.  **Analyze Valid Moves:**\n    *   **Move DOWN:** Head moves to (2, 3). The snake will then be facing DOWN. The next immediate moves would be LEFT (collides with S at 2, 2), RIGHT (to 2, 4, which is empty), or DOWN (collides with S at 3, 3). So, the only subsequent move is RIGHT. The path starts DOWN -> RIGHT.\n    *   **Move RIGHT:** Head moves to (1, 4). The snake will still be facing RIGHT. The next immediate moves would be UP (collides with wall '#'), DOWN (to 2, 4, which is empty), or RIGHT (to 1, 5, which is empty). This option provides more choices immediately (DOWN or RIGHT).\n5.  **Choose the Best Move:** Both DOWN and RIGHT are safe immediate moves. Let's look slightly ahead.\n    *   Going RIGHT keeps the snake higher up on the board initially. Moving RIGHT to (1, 4) allows subsequent moves DOWN (to 2, 4) or RIGHT (to 1, 5). The path RIGHT -> RIGHT -> DOWN seems to lead towards the apple at (6, 3) while maintaining space.\n    *   Going DOWN moves the head to (2, 3), forcing the next move to be RIGHT (to 2, 4). This state (head at 2, 4) is also reachable via RIGHT -> DOWN.\n    *   Considering the apple positions A(3, 6), A(4, 6), A(6, 3), and the constrained space, navigating towards the bottom apple A(6, 3) first seems safer than getting potentially trapped near the apples on the right wall. The path beginning RIGHT -> RIGHT -> DOWN... looks like a viable strategy to reach A(6, 3) safely.\n    *   Therefore, moving RIGHT seems the preferable first step.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n# SSH  #\n# S    #\n#SS   A#\n#SSS  A#\n#SS    #\n#SSA   #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 45\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (1, 4) (row 1, column 4, 0-based index inside walls).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot move LEFT (reverse direction).\nThe snake cannot move UP, as (0, 4) is a wall ('#').\n\nPossible moves are:\n1.  Continue RIGHT: Move to (1, 5). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  Turn DOWN: Move to (2, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n- Moving RIGHT to (1, 5): Keeps the snake high on the board. From (1, 5), the snake can move RIGHT again towards the column where two apples are located (column 6), or move DOWN. Path to apples at (3, 6) and (4, 6) seems clear (e.g., RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN).\n- Moving DOWN to (2, 4): Moves the snake lower. From (2, 4), the snake can move RIGHT towards the apples in column 6, or move DOWN towards the apple at (6, 3). Path to apples at (3, 6) and (4, 6) also seems clear (e.g., DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN).\n\nBoth moves are safe and provide paths to apples. Moving RIGHT keeps the snake in a slightly less constrained position initially (further from the bulk of its body below) and directly aligns better for a simple path to the pair of apples on the right side.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT seems like a reasonable choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n```\n########\n# SSSH #\n# S    #\n#SS   A#\n#SS   A#\n#SS    #\n#SSA   #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 46\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at row 1, column 6 (position (1, 6), using 1-based indexing for the playable area).\nThe snake's body segments (S) occupy several squares.\nApples (A) are at positions (3, 6), (4, 6), and (6, 4).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\n\nWe need to determine the next move ('UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT').\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move LEFT.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible moves:\n1.  **UP**: The position above the head (H) at (1, 6) is (0, 6). This position contains a wall ('#'). Moving UP would result in a collision. Game Over.\n2.  **DOWN**: The position below the head (H) at (1, 6) is (2, 6). This square is empty (' '). Moving DOWN is a valid move.\n3.  **LEFT**: The current direction is RIGHT, so moving LEFT is reversing direction, which is not allowed. Additionally, the position to the left of the head (H) at (1, 6) is (1, 5), which contains a snake body ('S'). Moving LEFT would result in a collision even if it were allowed. Game Over.\n4.  **RIGHT**: The position to the right of the head (H) at (1, 6) is (1, 7). This position contains a wall ('#'). Moving RIGHT would result in a collision.

This square contains 'S' (part of the snake's body). This move results in a collision with the snake itself.\n2.  **Turn DOWN:** The snake's head would move to position (7, 6). This square contains '#' (a wall). This move results in a collision with the wall.\n3.  **Continue RIGHT:** The snake's head would move to position (6, 7). This square contains '#' (a wall). This move results in a collision with the wall.\n4.  **Turn LEFT:** This move is invalid because the current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse its direction directly.\n\nAll valid moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) lead to a collision and thus the end of the game. Since I must provide a move, and all valid moves lead to game over, any of the valid directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) could be chosen. I will choose UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n# SSSS #\n# S  SA#\n#SS  SS#\n#S   SS#\n#   ASH#\n#  A SS#\n########\n```\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (5, 6).\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is not allowed as it reverses direction).\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The square at (4, 6) contains 'S'. This results in a collision with the snake's body. Game Over.\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The square at (5, 5) contains 'S'. This results in a collision with the snake's body. Game Over.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The square at (5, 7) contains '#'. This results in a collision with the wall. Game Over.\n\nAll possible moves lead to the end of the game. Since no move allows the snake to survive, any of the allowed moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) is a valid next step, although they all result in losing. Following the current direction is a possible choice.\n\nAnswer: UP"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

This is an empty space and a valid move.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (4, 4). This is an empty space and a valid move.\n\nTo maximize the chance of eating apples, the snake should move towards the nearest apple.\nApples are at (1, 1), (1, 3), and (2, 6).\nCurrent head position: (4, 3).\nDistances to apples:\n- Apple (1, 1): |4-1| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- Apple (1, 3): |4-1| + |3-3| = 3 + 0 = 3\n- Apple (2, 6): |4-2| + |3-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nThe nearest apple is at (1, 3).\n\nLet's see the distances after each possible valid move:\n- If move UP to (3, 3):\n    - Apple (1, 1): |3-1| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4\n    - Apple (1, 3): |3-1| + |3-3| = 2 + 0 = 2\n    - Apple (2, 6): |3-2| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4\n    Nearest apple distance: 2\n- If move LEFT to (4, 2):\n    - Apple (1, 1): |4-1| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4\n    - Apple (1, 3): |4-1| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n    - Apple (2, 6): |4-2| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6\n    Nearest apple distance: 4\n- If move RIGHT to (4, 4):\n    - Apple (1, 1): |4-1| + |4-1| = 3 + 3 = 6\n    - Apple (1, 3): |4-1| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n    - Apple (2, 6): |4-2| + |4-6| = 2 + 2 = 4\n    Nearest apple distance: 4\n\nMoving UP leads to the shortest distance (2) to the nearest apple. It is a safe move.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nMy goal is to eat the apples while avoiding collisions. The current position of the snake head (H) is (3, 3). The apples (A) are at (1, 1), (1, 3), and (2, 6). The snake is currently moving UP.\n\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (cannot move DOWN as it's the reverse direction).\n\n1.  **Move UP**: The head moves to (2, 3). This is a valid move into an empty space. This move brings the snake closer to the apple at (1, 3) (1 step away).\n2.  **Move LEFT**: The head moves to (3, 2). This is a valid move into an empty space. This move is further from the closest apple (1, 3).\n3.  **Move RIGHT**: The head moves to (3, 4). This is a valid move into an empty space. This move is further from the closest apple (1, 3).\n\nMoving UP is the most direct path towards the nearest apple at (1, 3). The snake is only length 1, so there's no risk of self-collision. Moving UP does not collide with a wall. Therefore, moving UP is the best strategy.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#A A   #\n#  H  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nThe snake's head is at (2, 3) and the current direction is UP.\nPossible moves:\n1.  **UP**: Move to (1, 3). This square contains an apple 'A'. Eating the apple is beneficial. The snake's head will be at (1, 3), and a new body segment will appear at (2, 3). This is a valid move (not a wall, not self).\n2.  **LEFT**: Move to (2, 2). This is an empty square. This is a valid move.\n3.  **RIGHT**: Move to (2, 4). This is an empty square. This is a valid move.\n4.  **DOWN**: Invalid move, as the snake cannot reverse its current direction (UP).\n\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which increases the score and snake length. This seems like the best strategic move. After moving UP, the snake will be at (1, 3) facing UP, with its body at (2, 3). From there, it can turn LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#A H   #\n#  S  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 3) and its body is at (2, 3). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and UP.\n1.  Moving UP would lead to position (0, 3), which is a wall '#'. This results in a game over.\n2.  Moving LEFT would lead to position (1, 2), which is empty ' '. This is a safe move. The snake would then be H at (1, 2), S at (1, 3). This move brings the snake closer to the apple at (1, 1).\n3.  Moving RIGHT would lead to position (1, 4), which is empty ' '. This is a safe move. The snake would then be H at (1, 4), S at (1, 3). This move moves away from the apple at (1, 1) but towards the apple at (2, 6).\n\nComparing LEFT and RIGHT: Moving LEFT allows the snake to potentially eat the apple at (1, 1) in the next step. Moving RIGHT requires more steps to reach the apple at (2, 6). Therefore, moving LEFT is the better immediate strategy to collect the closest apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#AHS   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 2) and the body segments are at (1, 3) and (1, 4). The current direction is LEFT.\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving RIGHT is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (1, 1). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move, the snake eats the apple, grows longer, and the score increases. The path ahead (DOWN) seems clear after eating.\n2.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (0, 2). This square is a wall ('#'). This leads to game over.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (2, 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nEating the apple is beneficial. Moving LEFT achieves this immediately and appears safe for the next step.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#HSS   #\n#   A A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\nThe current direction is LEFT. If the snake continues moving LEFT, it will hit the wall at (1, 0).\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT because it's the reverse of LEFT.\nMoving UP will lead to hitting the wall at (0, 1).\nMoving DOWN is the only valid move that avoids collision. The head will move to (2, 1).\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#SS    #\n#H  A A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake head is at (2, 1), and the body segments are at (1, 1) and (1, 2). The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN.\n1.  Move LEFT: The head would move to (2, 0), which is a wall ('#'). This is a losing move.\n2.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (3, 1). This is a safe empty square.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (2, 2). This is a safe empty square.\n\nComparing DOWN and RIGHT:\n- Moving DOWN takes the snake to (3, 1). From there, the snake could continue DOWN or turn RIGHT. This path moves away from the apples at (2, 4) and (2, 6).\n- Moving RIGHT takes the snake to (2, 2). From there, the snake could continue RIGHT towards the apples at (2, 4) and (2, 6), or turn DOWN. Moving RIGHT again would position the snake at (2, 3), setting up to eat the apple at (2, 4) on the subsequent move.\n\nChoosing RIGHT seems like the better strategy as it moves the snake towards the nearest cluster of apples.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#S     #\n#SH A A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 3).

This is empty space. Valid.\n- Moving RIGHT: Head moves to (2, 4). This square contains an apple 'A'. Eating the apple is good. Valid.\n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. This increases the score and length. This move does not lead to a collision with the wall or the snake's body. Therefore, RIGHT is the best move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#      #\n#SSHA A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 4).

This square is empty (' '). It's a safe move.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (3, 4). This square is empty (' '). It's a safe move.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (2, 5). This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score and the snake's length. This is a safe and beneficial move.\n\nSince the objective is to eat apples, moving RIGHT is the best option.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#SSSH A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 4), moving RIGHT.\nThe body segments are at (2, 3), (2, 2), and (2, 1).\nApples are at (2, 6), (5, 3), and (6, 4).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.

This square is empty and valid.\n3.  **RIGHT:** Move to (2, 5). This square is empty and valid. Moving right leads towards the apple at (2, 6).\n\nMoving RIGHT is a safe move and progresses towards the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#      #\n# SSSHA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nMy analysis:\n1.  The snake's head is at (2, 6).\n2.  The current direction is RIGHT.\n3.  Possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Moving LEFT is forbidden as it's the reverse of RIGHT.\n4.  Moving UP: Head goes to (1, 6). This is a safe empty space.\n5.  Moving DOWN: Head goes to (3, 6). This is a safe empty space.\n6.  Moving RIGHT: Head goes to (2, 7). This is an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is beneficial (increases score and length) and safe. The snake will grow, and the new tail segment will appear where the old head was (2,6), but the head moves to (2,7), so no self-collision.\n\nChoosing the move that eats the apple is the best strategy here.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# SSSSH#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#   AA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 12\n\nBased on the current board state and the snake's direction (RIGHT), the snake's head is at position (2, 6).\nThe possible moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT. Moving LEFT is not allowed as it's the reverse of the current direction.\n\n1.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (2, 7), which is a wall ('#'). This leads to game over.\n2.  Move UP: The head would move to (1, 6), which is an empty space (' '). This is a safe move.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (3, 6), which is an empty space (' '). This is a safe move.\n\nComparing UP and DOWN:\n- Moving UP moves the snake away from the apples located at (5, 3), (6, 4), and (6, 5).\n- Moving DOWN moves the snake closer to the general area of the apples.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is the better strategic choice to approach the apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  SSSS#\n#     H#\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#   AA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 6). The body 'S' occupies (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3). Apples 'A' are at (5, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  LEFT: Move head to (3, 5). This position is empty. Valid move.\n2.  RIGHT: Move head to (3, 7). This position is a wall '#'. Invalid move (collision).\n3.  DOWN: Move head to (4, 6). This position is empty. Valid move.\n4.  UP: Cannot move UP because the current direction is DOWN (cannot reverse).\n\nComparing valid moves:\n-   LEFT: Moves the head to (3, 5). This moves the snake further away from the apples located at the bottom of the board.\n-   DOWN: Moves the head to (4, 6). This moves the snake closer to the general area of the apples. This seems like a better strategic move to approach the food.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#      #\n#   SSS#\n#     S#\n#     H#\n#  A   #\n#   AA #\n########\n```\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake head is at (4, 5).\nThe snake body is at (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3).\nApples are at (5, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Invalid, cannot reverse direction from DOWN.\n2.  DOWN: Move to (5, 5). This is an empty space.\n3.  LEFT: Move to (4, 4). This is an empty space.\n4.  RIGHT: Move to (4, 6). This is a wall ('#'). Invalid.\n\nValid moves are DOWN and LEFT.\n\nLet's evaluate the valid moves:\n- Move DOWN: Head goes to (5, 5). This is safe. It moves closer to the apples at (6, 3) and (6, 4). The nearest apple at (6, 4) is 2 steps away (e.g., DOWN, LEFT).\n- Move LEFT: Head goes to (4, 4). This is safe. It moves closer to the apple at (5, 2) and (6, 4). The nearest apple at (6, 4) is 2 steps away (e.g., DOWN, DOWN).\n\nBoth moves are safe and lead towards apples. Moving DOWN keeps the snake moving in the current direction and positions it well to collect the apples in row 6. Let's choose DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#  A  H#\n#   AA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake head is at (5, 6).

This position is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This leads to a collision.\n2.  Move RIGHT: The head would move to (5, 7). This position is a wall ('#'). This leads to a collision.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head would move to (6, 6). This position is empty (' '). This is a safe move.\n\nTherefore, the only safe move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#      #\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#  A  S#\n#   AAH#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 6).

Moving RIGHT is not allowed because the current direction is LEFT (cannot reverse direction).\n\nThe only safe move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#     S#\n#     S#\n# A   S#\n#  A  S#\n# A HSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 18\n\nThe current head position is (6, 4) (row 6, column 4, inside the walls).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Moving RIGHT is forbidden as it reverses the current direction.\n1.  Check move UP: The head would move to (5, 4). This position is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n2.  Check move DOWN: The head would move to (7, 4). This position is a wall ('#'). This move is invalid (collision).\n3.  Check move LEFT: The head would move to (6, 3). This position is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n\nComparing valid moves UP and LEFT:\n- Moving UP positions the head at (5, 4). The apples are at (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2). This move takes the snake further from the apple at (6, 2) but closer vertically to the other two.\n- Moving LEFT positions the head at (6, 3). This move takes the snake closer horizontally to all three apples. The next move could be LEFT again to eat the apple at (6, 2).\n\nMoving LEFT seems like a good strategy to approach the cluster of apples directly.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     S#\n# A   S#\n#  A  S#\n# AHSSS#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 19\n\nSnake Head: H at (6, 2)\nSnake Body: S at (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)\nApples: A at (4, 1), (5, 2), (6, 1)\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move head to (5, 2). This square contains an apple 'A'. This move is valid. Eating the apple increases score and length.\n2.  DOWN: Move head to (7, 2). This square is a wall '#'. This move leads to collision and game over.\n3.  LEFT: Move head to (6, 1). This square contains an apple 'A'. This move is valid. Eating the apple increases score and length.\n4.  RIGHT: Cannot move RIGHT because the current direction is LEFT (snake cannot reverse direction).\n\nAnalysis:\nBoth UP and LEFT are valid moves that immediately eat an apple. We need to consider the subsequent positions.\n\nIf move UP:\n- Head moves to (5, 2), eats apple. Direction becomes UP.\n- New state: H at (5,2). Body grows, new segment at (6,2). Snake length increases.\n- From (5, 2), moving UP, the possible next moves are LEFT (to 5, 1) or RIGHT (to 5, 3). Both are empty squares. Moving LEFT positions the snake towards the other apples at (4,1) and (6,1). Moving RIGHT moves away from the apples and towards the existing snake body. Moving LEFT seems strategically better.\n\nIf move LEFT:\n- Head moves to (6, 1), eats apple. Direction becomes LEFT.\n- New state: H at (6,1). Body grows, new segment at (6,2). Snake length increases.\n- From (6, 1), moving LEFT, the possible next moves are UP (to 5, 1) or DOWN (to 7, 1). DOWN leads to a wall collision. Therefore, the only possible next move is UP to (5, 1). This position is currently empty.\n\nComparing the two options:\n- Moving UP first provides more flexibility in the next step (choice of LEFT or RIGHT).\n- Moving LEFT first forces the next move to be UP.\n\nChoosing UP gives more options immediately after eating the apple. Let's trace the path UP -> LEFT:\n1.  Move UP: Eat apple at (5,2). H is at (5,2). Direction UP.\n2.  Move LEFT: H is at (5,1). Direction LEFT. Now possible moves are UP (to (4,1), eats apple) or DOWN (to (6,1), eats apple). Eating the apple at (6,1) via DOWN leads to an immediate dead end as the only next move RIGHT hits the body segment at (6,2). So, UP is forced next. UP -> LEFT -> UP eats two apples and ends with H at (4,1) moving UP, which seems survivable.\n\nLet's trace the path LEFT -> UP:\n1.  Move LEFT: Eat apple at (6,1). H is at (6,1). Direction LEFT.\n2.  Move UP: H is at (5,1). Direction UP. Now possible moves are LEFT (wall) or RIGHT (to (5,2), eats apple). This is forced.\n3.  Move RIGHT: Eat apple at (5,2). H is at (5,2). Direction RIGHT. Now possible moves are UP (to (4,2)) or DOWN (to (6,2), hits body). UP is forced next. LEFT -> UP -> RIGHT -> UP eats two apples but maneuvering after seems difficult, and getting the last apple at (4,1) seems deadly.\n\nThe path starting with UP appears slightly safer and maintains better positioning for future moves after eating two apples. Therefore, UP is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#     S#\n# A   S#\n#  H  S#\n# ASSSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 20\n\nMoving UP will move the head 'H' to (4, 3), which is an empty space. This moves towards the apple at (1, 3).\nMoving LEFT will move the head 'H' to (5, 2), which is an empty space. This moves towards the apple at (4, 1).\nMoving RIGHT will move the head 'H' to (5, 4), which is an empty space. This moves away from apples.\nMoving DOWN is not allowed as it reverses the current direction UP.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are valid moves towards apples. Moving UP heads towards the apple at (1, 3) and keeps the snake in a relatively open area. Moving LEFT heads towards the apple at (4, 1) but moves closer to the snake's tail and the left wall. UP seems like a reasonable choice to target the northern apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH  S#\n#  S  S#\n# ASSSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nExplanation:\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (4, 4). The current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n1.  Move UP: The head moves to (3, 4). This square is empty. Valid move.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (4, 3). This square is empty. Valid move.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (4, 5). This square is empty. Valid move.\n\nApples 'A' are at (1, 3), (4, 2), and (6, 2).\nThe snake body 'S' occupies squares (4, 6), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6).\n\nLet's analyze the valid moves:\n- Moving UP to (3, 4) is safe. It moves towards the apple at (1, 3).\n- Moving LEFT to (4, 3) is safe. It moves towards the apple at (4, 2). The next move could be LEFT again to (4, 2) to eat the apple. If the snake moves LEFT to (4, 3), the next possible moves are UP (to 3, 3), LEFT (to 4, 2 - eat apple), DOWN (to 5, 3 - collision!). So moving LEFT sets up eating the apple at (4,2) in the next step.\n- Moving RIGHT to (4, 5) is safe. It moves away from the nearest apples. The next possible moves would be UP (to 3, 5), RIGHT (to 4, 6 - collision!), DOWN (to 5, 5).\n\nComparing UP and LEFT: Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat the nearest apple (at 4, 2) in the subsequent move. Moving UP positions the snake further from the closest apple but closer to the apple at (1, 3). Eating the closest apple quickly is generally a good strategy. The path after eating the apple by moving LEFT seems safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n# HS  S#\n#  S  S#\n# ASSSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 22\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\n1.  The snake's head is at (4, 1).\n2.  The current direction is LEFT.\n3.  The snake cannot turn RIGHT (the opposite direction).\n4.  Possible next moves are UP, DOWN, and LEFT.\n5.  Let's evaluate each move:\n    *   **LEFT:** The head moves to (4, 0). This is a valid empty space. From (4,0), the snake could move DOWN towards the apple at (6,0). However, after potentially moving LEFT -> DOWN -> DOWN to eat the apple at (6,0), the head would be at (6,0) moving DOWN. The only possible move then would be RIGHT into the snake's body at (6,1), leading to a game over. So, going for this apple is dangerous.\n    *   **DOWN:** The head moves to (5, 1). This is a valid empty space. From (5,1), the snake could move LEFT and then DOWN towards the apple at (6,0). This leads to the same dangerous situation described above after eating the apple.\n    *   **UP:** The head moves to (3, 1). This is a valid empty space. This move takes the snake away from the immediate danger zone near its tail and the bottom-left apple trap. It also positions the snake to potentially go after the apples in the upper part of the board later.\n\nComparing the options, moving UP is the safest choice as it avoids the immediate trap associated with the apple at (6,0) and moves the snake towards a more open area with other apples.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# H    #\n# SS   #\n#  S  S#\n# ASSSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 23\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head is at (3, 2). The current direction is UP.\nPossible next moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n1.  Move UP: The head moves to (2, 2). This position is empty (' ') and not a wall ('#') or part of the snake's body ('S'). This move is safe and moves towards the apple at (1, 2).\n2.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (3, 1). This position is empty (' ') and not a wall ('#') or part of the snake's body ('S'). This move is safe but moves away from the nearest apple.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (3, 3). This position is empty (' ') and not a wall ('#') or part of the snake's body ('S'). This move is safe but moves away from the nearest apple.\n\nThe safest moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. To maximize the score, the snake should move towards the apples. The apple at (1, 2) is directly above the head. Moving UP is the most direct path to eat this apple.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#  A  A#\n# H    #\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n#  S   #\n# ASSSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 24\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 2).

This seems like a good move.\n-   Move RIGHT to (2, 3): The snake is now one step away (UP) from the apple at (1, 3). This is also a good move.\n-   Move LEFT to (2, 1): This moves the snake away from the nearest apple.\n\nComparing moving UP and RIGHT:\n-   Moving UP to (1, 2) allows the next move to be RIGHT to eat the apple at (1, 3). After eating, the snake will be heading RIGHT, which is towards the apple at (1, 6).\n-   Moving RIGHT to (2, 3) allows the next move to be UP to eat the apple at (1, 3). After eating, the snake will be heading UP, facing the wall, and would need to turn RIGHT or LEFT.\n\nMoving UP seems slightly better strategically as it sets up the direction for the next apple after eating the current closest one.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n# HA  A#\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n#  S   #\n# ASSS #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 25\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (1, 2).\nThe current direction is UP.\nPossible next moves are LEFT or RIGHT.

Continuing RIGHT for two more steps would reach this apple.\n- Moving LEFT puts the head at (1, 1).

The snake is currently moving RIGHT. The body ('S') occupies several squares. There are apples ('A') at (1, 6), (2, 6), and (6, 0).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  **Continue RIGHT:** The square to the right (1, 4) is empty. This is a valid move.\n2.  **Turn UP:** The square above (0, 3) is a wall ('#'). This move leads to collision and game over. Invalid move.\n3.  **Turn DOWN:** The square below (2, 3) is empty. This is a valid move.\n4.  **Turn LEFT:** The snake is moving RIGHT, so turning LEFT is reversing direction, which is not allowed. Invalid move.\n\nWe need to choose between moving RIGHT and moving DOWN.\n\n*   **Moving RIGHT to (1, 4):** This move is safe. It positions the snake closer to the apples at (1, 6) and (2, 6). The path to these apples appears open: (1, 4) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 6) [Apple] -> (2, 6) [Apple]. This seems like a good offensive strategy.\n*   **Moving DOWN to (2, 3):** This move is also safe. However, it moves the snake away from the cluster of two apples. From (2, 3), the snake could potentially move RIGHT or DOWN, but the path towards the remaining apple at (6, 0) seems complicated due to the snake's own body.\n\nMoving RIGHT is the better immediate option as it leads directly towards two easily accessible apples while being a safe move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n# SSH A#\n# S   A#\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n#  S   #\n# ASS  #\n########\n```\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake's head is at (1, 4) (row 1, column 4).\nPossible moves:\n1.

New direction is RIGHT. The only valid move from (1, 6) is DOWN to (2, 6). The snake is near the top-right corner.\n- If I move DOWN: Head moves to (2, 5). Eats apple. New direction is DOWN. From (2, 5), possible moves are DOWN (to 3, 5), LEFT (to 2, 4), and RIGHT (to 2, 6).

So, RIGHT is not a valid move.\n2.  **Check UP:** Moving UP leads to (1, 6), which contains an apple 'A'. Eating the apple is good. However, after moving UP, the head will be at (1, 6), and the old head position (2, 6) will become body 'S'. The new current direction will be UP. The only possible next moves from (1, 6) will be LEFT (to (1, 5), which is body 'S' - collision) or RIGHT (to (1, 7), which is a wall '#' - collision).

This is safe and moves the snake closer to the apple at (4, 4) and potentially the apple at (1, 6). However, it moves closer to the snake's body segment at (2, 5).\n5.  Decision: Both DOWN and LEFT are safe moves that position the snake towards apples. Moving DOWN leads to a slightly more open area initially (row 4 vs row 3) and maintains the current direction. Moving LEFT turns towards the closer apple at (4, 4) but slightly reduces immediate open space near the head.

This is a valid move.\n\nWe have two valid moves: UP and RIGHT. We need to choose the best one. The goal is to eat apples and survive. There are apples at (1, 6), (3, 2), and (3, 4).\n\nLet's evaluate the valid moves:\n-   **Move UP to (4, 1)**:\n    -   The head is now at (4, 1).\n    -   This position is safe.\n    -   From (4, 1), the next possible moves (current direction UP) would be UP to (3, 1) or RIGHT to (4, 2).\n    -   Moving UP again to (3, 1) and then RIGHT to (3, 2) allows eating the apple at (3, 2) in two more steps.\n-   **Move RIGHT to (5, 2)**:\n    -   The head is now at (5, 2).\n    -   This position is safe.\n    -   From (5, 2), the next possible moves (current direction RIGHT) would be UP to (4, 2) or LEFT to (5, 1).\n    -   Moving UP to (4, 2) and then UP again to (3, 2) allows eating the apple at (3, 2) in two more steps.\n\nBoth moves UP and RIGHT position the snake to potentially eat the apple at (3, 2) in the near future. Moving UP keeps the snake slightly more central and seems to offer good subsequent options (UP towards (3, 1) or RIGHT towards (4, 2)). Moving RIGHT forces the next move towards the apple to be UP. Let's choose UP as it appears safe and strategically sound.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#    SA#\n#    SS#\n#  A AS#\n# H SSS#\n# S S  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent head position: (4, 1) (Row 4, Column 1)\nSnake body segments are at: (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (1, 4).\nApples are at: (1, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4).\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake cannot move DOWN (reversing direction).\nPossible moves:\n1.  LEFT: Move to (4, 0). This is a wall '#'. Collision. Invalid.\n2.  RIGHT: Move to (4, 2). This is an empty space '.'. Valid.\n3.  UP: Move to (3, 1). This is an empty space '.'. Valid.\n\nLet's analyze the valid moves:\n\nMove RIGHT:\n- The head moves to (4, 2).\n- The next possible moves from (4, 2) with direction RIGHT would be:\n    - UP: (3, 2). This square contains an apple 'A'. Valid move, eats apple.\n    - DOWN: (5, 2). This is an empty space '.'. Valid move.\n    - RIGHT: (4, 3). This square contains snake body 'S'. Collision. Invalid.\n- If we move RIGHT, the immediate next moves are UP (eat apple) or DOWN.\n- Let's check the move DOWN from (4, 2). If the head moves to (5, 2) (direction DOWN), the next possible moves are:\n    - LEFT: (5, 1). Contains 'S'. Collision.\n    - RIGHT: (5, 3). Contains 'S'. Collision.\n    - DOWN: (6, 2). Contains 'S'. Collision.\n- So, if we move RIGHT to (4, 2), the only viable next move that avoids immediate collision is UP to (3, 2) to eat the apple. This forces eating the apple.\n\nMove UP:\n- The head moves to (3, 1).\n- The next possible moves from (3, 1) with direction UP would be:\n    - UP: (2, 1). This is an empty space '.'. Valid move.\n    - LEFT: (3, 0). This is a wall '#'. Collision. Invalid.\n    - RIGHT: (3, 2). This square contains an apple 'A'. Valid move, eats apple.\n- If we move UP, the next moves can be either UP (to 2, 1) or RIGHT (to 3, 2, eat apple). This move keeps more options open than moving RIGHT.\n\nComparing UP and RIGHT: Moving RIGHT forces the snake to immediately target the apple at (3, 2). While getting apples is good, analyzing further suggests that eating the apple at (3, 2) and then the apple at (3, 4) quickly leads to a position where the snake gets trapped by its own body. Moving UP allows the snake to either go for the apple at (3, 2) or maneuver into the upper part of the board, potentially setting up a safer approach to the apples or simply surviving longer. Given the risk associated with the path forced by moving RIGHT, moving UP is the safer and more flexible strategic choice.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#     A#\n#    SS#\n# HA AS#\n# S SSS#\n# S S  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 41\n\nAnalyze the possible moves:\n1.  **UP**: The snake head 'H' is at (3, 1). Moving UP leads to (2, 1). This cell is empty (' '). This move is valid (not a wall, not self-collision, not reversing direction).\n2.  **DOWN**: The current direction is UP, so moving DOWN is not allowed as it's reversing direction.\n3.  **LEFT**: Moving LEFT leads to (3, 0). This cell is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT leads to (3, 2). This cell is empty (' '). This move is valid.\n\nEvaluate the valid moves:\n-   **Moving RIGHT**: Leads to (3, 2). The next move could be RIGHT again to (3, 3) to eat an apple ('A'). Let's trace this path:\n    - Move RIGHT to (3, 2). Snake: H(3,2), Body starts at (3,1).\n    - Move RIGHT to (3, 3) (Eat Apple 'A'). Snake: H(3,3), Body starts at (3,2). Snake grows, tail doesn't shorten.\n    - From H(3,3), direction RIGHT. Possible moves: UP (to 2,3 - safe), DOWN (to 4,3 - safe), RIGHT (to 3,4 - Apple 'A').\n    - If move RIGHT to (3, 4) (Eat Apple 'A'). Snake: H(3,4), Body starts at (3,3). Snake grows again.\n    - From H(3,4), direction RIGHT. Possible moves: UP (to 2,4 - Collision with 'S'!), DOWN (to 4,4 - Collision with 'S'!), RIGHT (to 3,5 - Collision with 'S'!).\n    - This path leads to certain death after eating the two apples. Therefore, moving RIGHT initially is dangerous if the plan is to eat the nearby apples quickly.\n\n-   **Moving LEFT**: Leads to (3, 0). The snake is now against the left wall. From (3,0), moving LEFT, the only possible next moves are UP (to 2,0) or DOWN (to 4,0). This significantly limits mobility and moves away from all apples into a corner potentially blocked by the snake's own body. This seems like a poor strategic choice.\n\n-   **Moving UP**: Leads to (2, 1). The snake head is now further from the immediate cluster of its body. From (2,1), moving UP, the possible next moves are UP (to 1,1), LEFT (to 2,0), or RIGHT (to 2,2). This move keeps options open, provides access to the upper part of the board, and avoids the immediate trap posed by moving RIGHT towards the apples. It seems like the safest move for survival and potentially allows for better positioning later.\n\nComparing UP and LEFT, UP seems superior as it maintains more options and moves towards a more open area. Comparing UP and RIGHT, RIGHT leads towards a known trap if apples are pursued aggressively. While RIGHT followed by UP might be viable, starting with UP seems safer and offers more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#     A#\n# H   S#\n# SA AS#\n# S SSS#\n# S S  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 42\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 2) (row 2, column 2, using 1-based indexing for the playable area).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so DOWN is not a valid move.\nThe valid moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (1, 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. This path leads towards the apple at (1,6), but detailed path analysis shows it likely leads to a trap after eating that apple.\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (2, 1). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. This path moves the snake towards the left wall. Path analysis shows this also likely leads to a trap, either going down the column or going up towards apple (1,6).\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (2, 3). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. This path leads towards the two apples at (3, 4) and (3, 5).\n\nLet's trace the RIGHT path further:\n- Current: H(2,2), Dir: UP\n- Move RIGHT: H(2,3), Dir: RIGHT. Board space clear.\n- Move RIGHT: H(2,4), Dir: RIGHT. Board space clear.\n- Move DOWN: H(3,4), Dir: DOWN. Eat apple A1. Length increases. Seems clear.\n- Move RIGHT: H(3,5), Dir: RIGHT. Eat apple A2.

Seems clear.\n- From (3,5), the only safe immediate move appears to be UP to (2,5).\n- From (2,5), the only safe immediate move appears to be UP to (1,5).\n- From (1,5), moving RIGHT to (1,6) eats apple A3.\n- After eating A3 at (1,6), the snake is trapped in the top-right corner.\n\nAlthough this path leads to a trap, it allows the snake to eat all 3 remaining apples, maximizing the score before the inevitable end in this seemingly difficult board configuration. The other paths (UP, LEFT) appear to lead to traps much sooner, likely allowing only one apple (or none) to be eaten. Therefore, moving RIGHT is the best strategy to maximize the score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#     A#\n# SH   #\n# SA AS#\n# S SSS#\n# S S  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 43\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. We cannot move LEFT because it's the reverse of the current direction RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move from (2, 3) to (1, 3). This square is empty (' '). This move is safe and does not cause collision with walls or the snake's body. It positions the snake closer to the apple at (1, 6).\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move from (2, 3) to (3, 3). This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is good, but we need to check the situation afterward.\n    *   If the snake moves DOWN, the head will be at (3, 3), and the old head position (2, 3) becomes part of the body.\n    *   The snake's direction will be DOWN. The next possible moves would be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n    *   LEFT: Moves to (3, 2), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). Collision.\n    *   RIGHT: Moves to (3, 4), which is empty (' '). Seems safe initially, but the path ahead is tricky. From (3, 4) moving RIGHT, UP goes to (2, 4) (empty), DOWN goes to (4, 4) (body collision), RIGHT goes to (3, 5) (body collision). So only UP is possible next.\n    *   DOWN: Moves to (4, 3), which is empty (' '). From (4, 3) moving DOWN, LEFT goes to (4, 2) (body collision), RIGHT goes to (4, 4) (body collision), DOWN goes to (5, 3) (body collision). All next moves lead to collision.\n    *   Therefore, moving DOWN leads to a very restricted position or an immediate game over after the next step. This move is too risky.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move from (2, 3) to (2, 4). This square is empty (' '). This move is safe. It keeps the snake moving horizontally. From (2, 4), moving RIGHT, the snake could then move UP towards the apple at (1, 6).\n\nComparing UP and RIGHT: Both moves are immediately safe. Moving DOWN is unsafe. Moving UP positions the snake directly below the row of the apple at (1, 6). Moving RIGHT keeps the snake on the same row but moves horizontally. Both allow a path towards the apple at (1, 6). Moving UP seems slightly more direct towards the highest apple. Let's choose UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#  H  A#\n# SS   #\n# SA A #\n# S SSS#\n# S S  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 44\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (1, 3).

From (1, 2), the possible moves are LEFT (to 1, 1) or DOWN (to 2, 2, which is occupied by 'S'). Moving LEFT might lead into a corner.\n2.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (1, 4). The new direction is RIGHT. From (1, 4), the possible moves are RIGHT (to 1, 5), or DOWN (to 2, 4, which is empty). Moving RIGHT leads towards the apple at (1, 6) and seems to offer more open space.\n\nMoving RIGHT appears to be the safer and more promising move as it maintains access to more open space and moves towards an apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#  SH A#\n# SS   #\n# SA A #\n# S SS #\n# S S  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 45\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (1, 5) (row 1, column 5, using 0-based indexing from the top-left corner inside the walls).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves:\n1.  **RIGHT**: Move to (1, 6). This square contains an apple 'A'. This move is valid, eats an apple, and increases the score. The snake will grow.\n2.  **UP**: Move to (0, 5). This square contains a wall '#'. This move is invalid due to collision.\n3.  **DOWN**: Move to (2, 5). This square is empty ' '. This move is valid.\n4.  **LEFT**: The current direction is RIGHT, so moving LEFT is reversing direction, which is not allowed.\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n- Moving RIGHT results in eating an apple immediately.\n- Moving DOWN keeps the snake alive but doesn't score this turn.\n\nThe objective is to eat as many apples as possible. Moving RIGHT achieves this directly and safely in this step. After moving RIGHT to (1, 6), the only possible next move would be DOWN to (2, 6), which is currently empty, so it doesn't lead to an immediate trap.

However, after eating the apple, the head would be at (1, 6) and the direction would remain RIGHT. The possible next moves would be UP (0, 6) = Wall, DOWN (2, 6) = Wall, LEFT (1, 5) = Snake body. All subsequent moves lead to a collision.\n\nComparing DOWN and RIGHT: Moving RIGHT leads to eating an apple but results in an immediate game over on the next step.

This move is valid.\n4.  **UP:** Invalid move as the current direction is DOWN.\n\nLet's analyze the valid moves:\n-   **DOWN:** Moves to (3, 5), eats an apple. The next position has three valid moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). This fulfills the objective of eating apples and seems safe for the immediate next step.\n-   **LEFT:** Moves to (2, 4). This avoids the apple but moves closer to the snake's body at (2, 3). From (2, 4), the only safe immediate next move would be DOWN to (3, 4), as UP and LEFT would lead to collisions. This seems risky.\n-   **RIGHT:** Moves to (2, 6). This avoids the apple and moves into open space, potentially towards the apple at (1, 6). From (2, 6), UP (to apple) and DOWN are safe moves. This is a safe alternative but doesn't score immediately.\n\nChoosing DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple immediately and leaves multiple safe paths for the subsequent move. This aligns best with the goal of maximizing score while surviving.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#  SSSA#\n# SSAS #\n# SA H #\n# S    #\n# S S  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 48\n\nAnalysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 5).

This move heads towards apple (3, 2) but the path seems blocked soon.\n-   Moving RIGHT to (3, 6): This is a safe square. From (3, 6), the next move options (keeping direction RIGHT) would be DOWN to (4, 6). Moving RIGHT again would hit the wall ('#'). This move heads towards apple (1, 6).\n-   Moving DOWN to (4, 5): This is a safe square. From (4, 5), the next move options (keeping direction DOWN) would be LEFT to (4, 4), RIGHT to (4, 6), or DOWN to (5, 5). All these next positions are currently empty. This move maintains flexibility and provides access to multiple directions and potential paths towards apples.\n\nComparing the options, moving DOWN seems the safest choice as it keeps the most options open for subsequent moves without immediately cornering the snake or forcing a risky maneuver. It allows potential paths towards apples at (3, 2), (2, 4) via a left turn, or towards (1, 6) via a right turn.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n```\n########\n#  SSSA#\n# SSAS #\n# SA S #\n# S  H #\n# S    #\n# SSS  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (4, 5) (row 4, column 5, 0-indexed).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move UP.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Check move RIGHT:** The position to the right (4, 6) contains a wall '#'.

This path also leads to an apple but seems slightly longer and moves closer to the snake's body concentration in row 6.\n\nMoving LEFT appears to be a slightly better option as it's a shorter path to the nearest apple and potentially keeps the snake in a less constrained position compared to moving further down towards the bottom edge and the snake body cluster.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#  SSSA#\n# SSAS #\n# SA S #\n# S HS #\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n########\n```\n\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 4) (row 4, column 4, using 0-based indexing from the top-left).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  **LEFT:** Move to (4, 3).

Moving RIGHT would lead to (5, 7), which is a wall '#'. This results in a game over. Invalid move.\n2.  **Turn LEFT:** The current direction is RIGHT. Reversing direction to LEFT is not allowed. Invalid move.\n3.  **Turn UP:** The snake's head is at (5, 6). Moving UP would lead to (4, 6). This square is empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n4.  **Turn DOWN:** The snake's head is at (5, 6). Moving DOWN would lead to (6, 6). This square is empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n\nNow we compare the valid moves: UP and DOWN.\n\n*   **If we move UP:** The head moves to (4, 6). The path towards the apple at (1, 6) becomes available by continuing UP. Let's trace: UP to (4,6) -> UP to (3,6) -> UP to (2,6) -> UP to (1,6). This eats the apple. However, after eating the apple at (1,6) with direction UP, the next possible moves are LEFT (1,5 - collision with 'S'), RIGHT (1,7 - collision with '#'), and DOWN (2,6 - collision with the new body segment 'S'). The snake gets trapped immediately after eating the apple. So, moving UP is dangerous.\n*   **If we move DOWN:** The head moves to (6, 6). This enters the empty row 6. From (6,6) and direction DOWN, the only possible move is LEFT (to 6,5), as RIGHT hits a wall and UP reverses direction relative to the snake's body path immediately prior (the move from (5,6) to (6,6)). After moving LEFT to (6,5), the snake can continue LEFT into the open space. This move keeps the snake alive and provides maneuvering room in the empty bottom row, allowing potential access to other apples later.\n\nComparing the outcomes, moving UP leads to a trap after eating the apple. Moving DOWN ensures survival and provides more space to maneuver in the short term. Therefore, DOWN is the safer and better strategic move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#  SSSA#\n# SSAS #\n# SA S #\n# S SS #\n#   SS #\n#    H #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 53\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at row 6, column 5 (using 0-based indexing for the playable area, top-left is 0,0; or row 7, column 6 in the full 8x8 grid including walls).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves:\n1.  **LEFT**: Move to (6, 4).

This move is safe.\n3.  **DOWN**: Move to (7, 5). This square contains '#' (a wall). This move would result in a wall collision, ending the game. Invalid move.\n4.  **UP**: The current direction is DOWN, so moving UP is not allowed as it's the reverse direction. Invalid move.\n\nThe only valid and safe move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  SSSA#\n# SSAS #\n# SA S #\n#   SS #\n#   SS #\n#    SH#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 54\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves for the snake head 'H' located at coordinates (6, 6) (row, column, 0-indexed from top-left).

Identify the snake's head position: (4, 3).\n2.  Identify the current direction: UP.\n3.  Identify the apple positions: (1, 4), (5, 1), (6, 5).\n4.  Identify the forbidden move: Since the current direction is UP, the snake cannot move DOWN.\n5.  Evaluate possible moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT):\n    *   **UP**: Move to (3, 3). This square is empty and not a wall. It's a safe move. The closest apple from (3, 3) is (1, 4), which is 3 steps away (|1-3| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3).\n    *   **LEFT**: Move to (4, 2). This square is empty and not a wall. It's a safe move. The closest apple from (4, 2) is (5, 1), which is 2 steps away (|5-4| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2).\n    *   **RIGHT**: Move to (4, 4). This square is empty and not a wall. It's a safe move. The closest apples from (4, 4) are (1, 4) (|1-4| + |4-4| = 3 + 0 = 3) and (6, 5) (|6-4| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3), both 3 steps away.\n6.  Compare the outcomes: Moving LEFT brings the snake closest (2 steps) to an apple ((5, 1)). Moving UP or RIGHT results in the nearest apple being 3 steps away.\n7.  Choose the best move: Moving LEFT is the most promising move as it minimizes the distance to the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nMy choice is to move DOWN. This move allows the snake to eat the apple directly below it. This increases the score and the snake's length without immediate risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H   A#\n#     A#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 1) and its body is at (4, 1). The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. Moving UP is forbidden as it's the reverse direction.\n\n1.  **LEFT:** The head would move to (5, 0), which is a wall '#'. This leads to Game Over.\n2.  **RIGHT:** The head would move to (5, 2), which is an empty space ' '. This is a valid move. The snake would be H at (5, 2) and S at (5, 1). This move brings the snake closer to the apples at (5, 6) and (6, 5).\n3.  **DOWN:** The head would move to (6, 1), which is an empty space ' '. This is a valid move. The snake would be H at (6, 1) and S at (5, 1). This move brings the snake closer to the apple at (6, 5).\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN are safe moves. Moving RIGHT positions the snake horizontally towards two apples. Moving DOWN positions the snake vertically towards one apple and closer to the bottom wall. Moving RIGHT seems slightly better for accessing the apples and maintaining maneuverability.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SH  A#\n#     A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 4) and the body is at (5, 2). The current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible next moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. LEFT is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n1.  Move UP: Head moves to (4, 4). This square is empty. Valid move.\n2.  Move DOWN: Head moves to (6, 4). This square is empty. Valid move. This moves closer to the apple at (6, 5).\n3.  Move RIGHT: Head moves to (5, 5). This square is empty. Valid move. This moves closer to the apple at (5, 6) and (6, 5).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT lead towards nearby apples. Moving RIGHT positions the snake between two apples (at (5, 6) and (6, 5)), offering a choice in the subsequent move. Moving DOWN positions the snake below the apple at (5, 6) and adjacent to the apple at (6, 5). Moving RIGHT seems slightly more flexible.\n\nLet's choose RIGHT. The head will move to (5, 5).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SH A#\n#     A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head is at (5, 4) and the body is at (5, 3). The current direction is RIGHT.\nThe possible moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT. Moving LEFT is forbidden as it reverses the current direction.\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (4, 4). This square is empty and not a wall. It's a safe move. The closest apple from (4, 4) is at (5, 6) with a distance of 3.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (6, 4). This square is empty and not a wall. It's a safe move. The closest apple from (6, 4) is at (6, 6) with a distance of 2.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (5, 5). This square is empty and not a wall. It's a safe move. The closest apple from (5, 5) is at (5, 6) with a distance of 1.\n\nMoving RIGHT positions the snake's head directly adjacent to the apple at (5, 6), allowing it to be eaten in the next move. Moving DOWN positions the snake closer to the apple at (6, 6). Moving RIGHT offers the most immediate path to an apple.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SHA#\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 4) and the body 'S' is at (5, 3). The current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot move LEFT because it cannot reverse direction.\nThe possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (4, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. The snake would not eat an apple.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (6, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. The snake would not eat an apple.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (5, 5). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move. The snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1. The new head position will be (5, 5), and the body will occupy (5, 4) and (5, 3).\n\nEating an apple is the primary goal. Moving RIGHT achieves this immediately and does not lead to an immediate collision with walls or self. After moving RIGHT, the head will be at (5, 5), the body at (5, 4) and (5, 3), and the direction will be RIGHT. From (5, 5), the snake cannot move RIGHT (wall at (5, 6)) or LEFT (reverse direction), but can move UP to (4, 5) or DOWN to (6, 5), both of which are safe empty squares.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSH#\n#   A A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 6). The current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves:\n1.  Continue RIGHT: Moves to (5, 7), which is a wall '#'. This leads to game over.\n2.  Turn UP: Moves to (4, 6), which is an empty space ' '. This is a valid move.\n3.  Turn DOWN: Moves to (6, 6), which contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move, and the snake will eat the apple.\n4.  Turn LEFT: This is the opposite direction of the current movement (RIGHT) and is not allowed. Even if allowed, it would move to (5, 5), which is occupied by the snake's body 'S', leading to game over.\n\nComparing valid moves:\n- UP: Safe move, leads to an empty square.\n- DOWN: Safe move, eats an apple, increases score and length.\n\nEating the apple is beneficial. The position (6, 6) is safe. Therefore, moving DOWN is the best option.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#   SSS#\n#   A H#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 6). The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible next moves: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (UP is not allowed as it's the reverse of DOWN).\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (6, 5). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (6, 7). This square is a wall ('#'). Collision. Game Over.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head moves to (7, 6). This square is a wall ('#'). Collision. Game Over.\n\nThe only safe move is LEFT. Moving LEFT also positions the snake to potentially go after the apple at (6, 3).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#    SS#\n#   AHS#\n########\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n#    SS#\n#   HSS#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 10\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (6, 3). The current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move RIGHT.\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (6, 2). This position is empty ('.'). This is a valid move.\n2.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (5, 3). This position is empty ('.'). This is a valid move.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (7, 3). This position is a wall ('#'). This is not a valid move (collision).\n\nWe need to choose between LEFT and UP. The goal is to eat apples ('A') located at (1, 4), (3, 4), and (4, 2).\nThe closest apple is at (4, 2).\n- If we move LEFT to (6, 2), the path to (4, 2) could be (6, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (4, 2) (Apple).\n- If we move UP to (5, 3), the path to (4, 2) could be (5, 3) -> (5, 2) -> (4, 2) (Apple) or (5, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 2) (Apple).\n\nBoth moves allow reaching the nearest apple in 3 steps. Moving UP positions the head slightly more towards the center and away from the bottom wall, which might offer more flexibility later. Let's choose UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n#   H S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 4) (row 5, column 4). The current direction is UP. The snake cannot move DOWN. The possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (4, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a safe move.\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (5, 3). This square is empty (' '). This is a safe move.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (5, 5). This square is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This move would result in a collision and game over.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe moves.\n- Moving UP to (4, 4) positions the snake closer to the central area and allows subsequent moves towards any of the three apples. A turn LEFT from (4, 4) would lead to (4, 3), closer to the apple at (4, 2). A turn UP from (4, 4) leads to (3, 4), closer to the apple at (3, 5).\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 3) positions the snake closer to the apple at (4, 2) but further from the other two apples. A turn UP from (5, 3) would lead to (4, 3), closer to the apple at (4, 2).\n\nMoving UP seems like a reasonable strategy as it maintains flexibility and moves towards the central region of the available space, potentially opening paths to multiple apples.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#  AH  #\n#   S  #\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 12\n\nThe current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\nMoving UP leads to eating the apple at (3, 5). The head will move to (3, 5), and the snake will grow. This is a safe move and achieves the objective of eating an apple.\nMoving LEFT leads to (4, 4), which is empty. This is a safe move but does not eat an apple immediately.\nMoving RIGHT leads to (4, 6), which is empty. This is a safe move but does not eat an apple immediately.\nEating the apple is the priority. Moving UP eats the apple at (3, 5).\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   HA #\n#  AS  #\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 13\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 4). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse of UP.\n1. Move UP: The head moves to (2, 4). This is an empty space.\n2. Move LEFT: The head moves to (3, 3). This is an empty space.\n3. Move RIGHT: The head moves to (3, 5). This square contains an apple 'A'. Eating the apple is good.

LEFT is not allowed because it's the reverse of RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP**: The head would move to (2, 5). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid move. It positions the snake closer to the apple at (1, 5) and adjacent to the apple at (2, 4) (after the move, the head will be at (2,5) and the apple at (2,4) will be one step to the left).\n2.  **Move DOWN**: The head would move to (4, 5). This position is occupied by the snake's body 'S'. This move leads to a collision and is invalid.\n3.  **Move RIGHT**: The head would move to (3, 6). This position is empty (' '). This is a valid move. It moves the snake away from the apples.\n\nComparing the valid moves (UP and RIGHT):\n- Moving UP positions the snake to potentially eat an apple in the next move (either the one at (1, 5) by moving UP again, or the one at (2, 4) by moving LEFT).\n- Moving RIGHT moves the snake towards the edge of the board and further from the available apples.\n\nTherefore, moving UP is the strategically better choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#    A #\n#   AH #\n#   SS #\n#  AS  #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 15\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 5) (row 2, column 5, counting from 0 inside the walls).\nThe current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (cannot move DOWN as it's the reverse direction).\n\n1.  Move UP: The head would move to (1, 5). This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move, not hitting a wall or the snake's body. Eating the apple increases the score and length.\n2.

Move RIGHT: The head would move to (2, 6). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. No apple is eaten.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT allow the snake to eat an apple immediately. Let's consider the position after the move:\n- If moving UP to (1, 5): The head is near the top wall. The remaining apples are at (2, 4) and (4, 3).\n- If moving LEFT to (2, 4): The head is more central. The remaining apples are at (1, 5) and (4, 3). This position seems slightly better for accessing both remaining apples without getting too close to the edge immediately.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is a good strategy.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#   HS #\n#   SS #\n#  AS  #\n#   S A#\n#   S  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 4).

Turn LEFT: The head would move to (5, 5). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  Turn RIGHT: The head would move to (5, 7). This square is a wall ('#'). This is an invalid move (collision).\n4.  Turn UP: Reversing direction from DOWN to UP is not allowed. This is an invalid move.\n\nSo, the valid moves are DOWN and LEFT.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n-   Moving DOWN to (6, 6): This moves the snake further down, away from the apples located at (3, 0), (3, 2), and (4, 2). The next move would likely have to be LEFT to start moving towards the apples.\n-   Moving LEFT to (5, 5): This moves the snake closer horizontally to the apples. From (5, 5) with direction LEFT, the snake could then move UP towards (4, 5) or continue LEFT towards (5, 4), both bringing it closer to the apples. This seems like a more direct approach to reach the apples.\n\nChoosing LEFT positions the snake better to target the nearby apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#   SSS#\n#   S S#\n#A A  S#\n#  A  S#\n#    HS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 24\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 5).

This square is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This move leads to a collision and game over.\n\nWe need to choose between UP and LEFT. Let's consider the positions of the apples: (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 2).\n\n*   If we move **UP** to (3, 4): The closest apple is at (3, 2), which is two moves away (LEFT, LEFT). The apple at (4, 2) is three moves away (e.g., LEFT, DOWN, LEFT).\n*   If we move **LEFT** to (4, 3): The closest apple is at (4, 2), which is one move away (LEFT). The apple at (3, 2) is two moves away (UP, LEFT).\n\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat the apple at (4, 2) in the next move. This seems like a better immediate strategy. Let's check if moving LEFT leads to an immediate trap after eating the apple.\n\n*   Move LEFT to (4, 3).\n*   Next move LEFT to (4, 2) (eat apple). The snake grows. Head is at (4, 2). Direction is LEFT. Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n    *   UP goes to (3, 2), which contains another apple. This is a good follow-up move.\n    *   DOWN goes to (5, 2), which is empty.\n    *   LEFT goes to (4, 1), which is empty.\nMoving LEFT initially seems safe and leads directly to an apple, with good options afterwards.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#A A  S#\n#  AHSS#\n#    SS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at row 4, column 3.\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT.\nThe possible next moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (cannot move RIGHT, which is the opposite direction).\n\n1.

This move is valid.\n\nComparing the options, moving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. This is the primary goal of the game. Let's check the safety after eating the apple at (4,2). The head will be at (4,2), the current head (4,3) becomes body 'S', and the snake grows. The next possible moves from (4,2) while moving LEFT would be UP to (3,2) (another apple), DOWN to (5,2) (empty), or LEFT to (4,1) (empty). All seem safe in the immediate next step.

From there, can go UP to (4,0), then UP to (3,0) to eat Apple 1. This takes 3 moves (LEFT, UP, UP). This path seems safe and efficient for reaching the first apple. Continuing from (3,0) moving UP, turning RIGHT to (3,1) and RIGHT again to (3,2) eats the second apple (total 5 moves).\n    *   **Path via UP:** Move UP to (4,1). From there, can go UP to (3,1), then LEFT to (3,0) to eat Apple 1 (3 moves: UP, UP, LEFT). Alternatively, from (4,1), can go RIGHT to (4,2), then UP to (3,2) to eat Apple 2 (3 moves: UP, RIGHT, UP). Both paths seem safe initially. Following the second path (UP, RIGHT, UP), eating A2 at (3,2), the next moves could be LEFT to (3,1) and LEFT again to (3,0) to eat A1 (total 5 moves).\n    *   **Path via DOWN:** Move DOWN to (6,1). This moves away from the apples. Reaching an apple from here would take more steps (e.g., DOWN, LEFT, UP, UP, UP = 5 moves to A1) and potentially lead to tighter spots as analyzed in the thought process.\n\n3.  **Decision:** Both LEFT and UP are safe immediate moves and part of efficient paths (5 moves total) to collect both apples. The path starting with LEFT (LEFT, UP, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT) seems direct and safe. The path starting with UP (UP, RIGHT, UP, LEFT, LEFT) is equally efficient. Since the current direction is already LEFT, continuing LEFT requires no immediate turn and directly progresses towards Apple 1 along a viable path.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is a good choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A A  S#\n#  SSSS#\n#HSSASS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 30\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 1).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\n1.

Eating the apple increases the score and the snake's length.\nMoving LEFT would cause a collision with the wall '#'.\nMoving RIGHT would cause a collision with the snake's body 'S'.\nMoving DOWN is not allowed because the current direction is UP.\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#H A   #\n#S SSSS#\n#SSSASS#\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 32\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 1) (row 3, column 1, 0-indexed).

The next move could be UP (to eat apple at 2, 2) or RIGHT (to eat apple at 3, 3). However, moving RIGHT brings the head closer to the denser part of the snake's body.\n\nComparing the options:\nMoving UP seems the safest and most promising strategy. It positions the snake to eat the apple at (2, 2) in the next step and moves the head towards a more open area of the board, reducing the immediate risk of self-collision compared to moving RIGHT. Moving LEFT moves away from the apples.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#H A   #\n#S A   #\n#S SSS #\n#SSSASS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at row 2, column 1.\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so DOWN is not allowed.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  Check UP: Moving UP would place the head at row 1, column 1. This is an empty space (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  Check LEFT: Moving LEFT would place the head at row 2, column 0. This is a wall ('#'). This move leads to game over.\n3.  Check RIGHT: Moving RIGHT would place the head at row 2, column 2. This is an empty space (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nNow we compare the valid moves: UP and RIGHT.\n- Moving UP leads to (1, 1). From there, the snake can potentially move RIGHT towards the apple at (2, 3).\n- Moving RIGHT leads to (2, 2). From this position, the snake can immediately move RIGHT again to eat the apple at (2, 3). This path reaches the nearest apple faster.\n\nLet's analyze the position after moving RIGHT:\nThe head would be at (2, 2). The next move could be RIGHT to (2, 3) to eat the apple. After eating the apple, the head would be at (2, 3) and the snake grows. From (2, 3), the snake could move DOWN to eat the apple at (3, 3). This path seems safe and allows collecting two apples quickly.\n\nLet's analyze the position after moving UP:\nThe head would be at (1, 1). The snake would likely need to move RIGHT (to 1, 2), then DOWN (to 2, 2), then RIGHT (to 2, 3) to eat the first apple. This takes more steps.\n\nMoving RIGHT seems the better immediate choice as it positions the snake to eat the apple at (2, 3) in the next step.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#      #\n#SHA   #\n#S A   #\n#S SSS #\n#SSSAS #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 34\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 2) (row index 2, column index 2, using 0-based indexing from the top-left corner).\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies several squares.\nApples 'A' are at positions (2, 3), (3, 3), and (5, 4).\nThe current direction of movement is RIGHT.\n\nThe possible moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.

This square contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move. The snake will eat the apple, increase its score, and grow longer.\n\nThe goal is to eat as many apples as possible. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. This is generally a good strategy in Snake. After moving RIGHT, the head will be at (2, 3), and the snake can then potentially move DOWN to eat the apple at (3, 3) in the next step. Moving UP or DOWN does not result in eating an apple in this step.

The current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move head to (1, 5). This is an empty square ' '. This is a valid move.\n2.  DOWN: Move head to (3, 5). This is an empty square ' '. This is a valid move.\n3.  LEFT: This is the reverse of the current direction (RIGHT), so it's an invalid move.\n4.  RIGHT: Move head to (2, 6). This is a wall '#'. This move leads to game over.\n\nComparing valid moves UP and DOWN:\n- Moving UP to (1, 5) puts the snake in the second row, with open space to the left towards the apple at (1, 1). Seems safe.\n- Moving DOWN to (3, 5) puts the snake next to the apple at (3, 3), but also closer to its own body segments (S at 4,4 and 5,5). The available space after moving DOWN seems more restricted. Moving DOWN again from (3, 5) would lead to (4, 5), which is very close to the snake body S at (4,4) and (5,5). The only viable move from (4,5) would be DOWN to (5,5) which is a body segment. Thus moving DOWN is dangerous.\n\nTherefore, moving UP is the safer and better strategic move, allowing access to the apple at (1, 1) while maintaining more open space.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#A H   #\n#SSS   #\n#S A   #\n#S SSS #\n#SSSA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 36\n\nThe snake's head is at position (1, 3). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are LEFT and RIGHT. Moving UP would hit the wall '#', and moving DOWN is not allowed as it reverses the current direction.\n\n1.  **Check LEFT:** Moving LEFT means the head goes to (1, 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  **Check RIGHT:** Moving RIGHT means the head goes to (1, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the consequences of these moves:\n\n*   **If I move LEFT:** The head will be at (1, 2), and the direction will be LEFT. The board state would look like:\n    ```\n    ########\n    #AH S  #\n    #SSS   #\n    #S A   #\n    #S SSS #\n    #SSSA  #\n    #      #\n    ########\n    ```\n    From (1, 2) moving LEFT, the next possible moves are UP (wall), DOWN (to (2, 2), which is 'S' - collision), or LEFT (to (1, 1), which is 'A'). Eating the apple at (1, 1) is possible. After eating the apple at (1, 1), the head is at (1, 1), direction is LEFT. The snake has grown. The next moves from (1, 1) would be UP (wall), DOWN (to (2, 1), which is 'S' - collision), or LEFT (wall). This path leads to a dead end immediately after eating the apple.\n\n*   **If I move RIGHT:** The head will be at (1, 4), and the direction will be RIGHT. The board state would look like:\n    ```\n    ########\n    #A SH  #\n    #SSS   #\n    #S A   #\n    #S SSS #\n    #SSSA  #\n    #      #\n    ########\n    ```\n    From (1, 4) moving RIGHT, the next possible moves are UP (wall), DOWN (to (2, 4), which is empty - safe), or RIGHT (to (1, 5), which is empty - safe). This path keeps the snake alive and offers multiple subsequent safe moves, allowing it to potentially reach other apples later.\n\nComparing the two options, moving LEFT leads to a trap after eating the apple, while moving RIGHT keeps the snake safe and provides maneuvering space. Therefore, RIGHT is the better move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#A SH  #\n#SSS   #\n#S A   #\n#S SS  #\n#SSSA  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 4).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves:\n1.

RIGHT: Move to (1, 5). This is an empty space '.'. Safe.\n\nComparing safe moves:\n- Moving DOWN to (2, 4) positions the snake closer to the apples at (3, 3) and (5, 4). From (2, 4), the snake can move DOWN again to (3, 4) and then LEFT to eat the apple at (3, 3).\n- Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves the snake towards the right wall and away from the closest apples.\n\nMoving DOWN is a safe move that facilitates reaching the nearby apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#A SS  #\n#SSSH  #\n#S A   #\n#S S   #\n#SSSA  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nMoving DOWN: The snake head will move from (2, 4) to (3, 4). This square contains an apple 'A'. The snake will eat the apple, increase its score, and grow longer. There is no collision with walls or the snake's body. This is a valid and beneficial move.\n\nMoving LEFT: The snake head will move from (2, 4) to (2, 3). This square contains a part of the snake's body 'S'. This move leads to a collision and game over.\n\nMoving RIGHT: The snake head will move from (2, 4) to (2, 5). This square is empty. This is a valid move, but it does not lead to eating an apple immediately.\n\nComparing DOWN and RIGHT, moving DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is the objective of the game. Therefore, DOWN is the better move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#A SS  #\n#SSSS  #\n#S AH  #\n#S     #\n#SSSA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 39\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 5).

It moves towards the apple at (3, 3).\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (3, 6). This square is a wall ('#'). This is not a valid move (collision).\n\nComparing valid moves:\n-   Moving DOWN to (4, 5) is safe but moves away from the closest apples at (3, 3) and (1, 1), though closer to the one at (5, 4).\n-   Moving LEFT to (3, 4) is safe and positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (3, 3) in the next move by turning LEFT again.\n\nChoosing LEFT seems strategically better as it allows approaching an apple directly.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#A SS A#\n#SSSS  #\n#S HS  #\n#S     #\n#SSSA  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 40\n\nAnalysis:\nThe snake's head (H) is at coordinates (3, 3).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe possible next moves are:\n1.

I cannot move LEFT.\nThere are three apples 'A' on the board at positions (1, 1), (1, 6), and (5, 4).\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (3, 5). This position is empty (' '). This is a safe move. The distance to the nearest apple A3 (5, 4) increases. The distance to A2 (1, 6) decreases.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (5, 5). This position is empty (' '). This is a safe move. This move places the head adjacent to the apple A3 at (5, 4).\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (4, 6). This position is empty (' '). This is a safe move. This move places the head closer to the apple A2 at (1, 6).\n\nComparing the moves:\n- Moving UP takes me further from the closest apple A3.\n- Moving RIGHT takes me further from A3 but closer to A2.\n- Moving DOWN takes me directly towards the closest apple A3, putting me in a position to eat it on the next turn by moving LEFT.\n\nMoving DOWN seems like the best strategy as it allows me to target the nearest apple quickly. The position (5, 5) is safe and provides a clear path to apple A3.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#A SS A#\n#SSSS  #\n#S SS  #\n#S SS  #\n#S  H  #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 43\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (5, 4) (row 5, column 4, 0-indexed).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move UP.\nThe possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (6, 4). This square contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move. Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and the snake's length. The head will be at (6, 4). The next possible moves from (6, 4) would be LEFT (to 6, 3 - empty) or RIGHT (to 6, 5 - empty), as moving DOWN again would hit the wall '#'. This move achieves the goal of eating an apple.\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (5, 3). This square is empty ' '. This is a valid move. No apple is eaten.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (5, 5). This square is empty ' '. This is a valid move. No apple is eaten.\n\nComparing the options, moving DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is the primary objective. The position after eating the apple is safe, with escape routes to the LEFT and RIGHT. Moving LEFT or RIGHT is safe but does not immediately increase the score. Therefore, the best move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#A SSAA#\n#SSSS  #\n#S SS  #\n#S SS  #\n#S  S  #\n#   H  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 44\n\nMy thinking process to decide the next move:\n1.  Identify the snake's head position: (row 6, col 4).\n2.  Identify the current direction: DOWN.\n3.  Determine valid moves based on rules:\n    *   Cannot move UP (reverse of DOWN).\n    *   Cannot move DOWN (hits the wall '#').\n    *   Can move LEFT to (6, 3) (empty space).\n    *   Can move RIGHT to (6, 5) (empty space).\n4.  Evaluate valid moves (LEFT and RIGHT):\n    *   Moving LEFT to (6, 3): This position is safe (not a wall or snake body). It positions the snake to potentially move UP towards the apple at (1, 1).\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (6, 5): This position is also safe. It positions the snake to potentially move UP towards the apples at (1, 5) and (1, 6).\n5.  Compare LEFT and RIGHT: Both moves are immediately safe. Moving LEFT directs the snake towards column 3, which seems slightly less congested by the snake's body in the rows above compared to column 5. This might offer better maneuverability to reach the apples.\n6.  Conclusion: Choose LEFT as the next move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#A SSAA#\n#SSSS  #\n#S SS  #\n#S SS  #\n#   S  #\n#  HS  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 45\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 3). The current direction is LEFT.\nThe possible moves are LEFT, UP, and DOWN.\n1.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (6, 2). This is an empty space. This move is valid.\n2.  Move UP: The head moves to (5, 3). This is an empty space. This move is valid.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head moves to (7, 3). This is a wall ('#'). This move leads to a collision and ends the game.\n4.  Move RIGHT: This is the reverse of the current direction (LEFT) and is not allowed.\n\nNow let's analyze the consequences of the valid moves (LEFT and UP):\n- If we move UP to (5, 3): The next possible moves would be LEFT to (5, 2) (empty), UP to (4, 3) (snake body 'S'), or DOWN to (6, 3) (snake body 'S'). Moving UP would immediately trap the snake, as both UP and DOWN in the next step lead to self-collision.\n- If we move LEFT to (6, 2): The next possible moves would be LEFT to (6, 1) (empty) or UP to (5, 2) (empty). (DOWN is a wall). This move keeps options open.\n\nMoving LEFT is the safer move, allowing continued play without immediate risk of collision or trapping.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#A SSAA#\n#SSSS  #\n#S SS  #\n#  SS  #\n#   S  #\n# HSS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 46\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 2).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n- Moving LEFT: The head goes to (6, 1).

All are in the top part of the board.\nMoving UP brings the snake's head closer to the general area of the apples.\nMoving LEFT moves the head towards the apple at (1, 1) horizontally but keeps the snake low and potentially restricts future movement (next move would likely have to be UP).\nMoving UP to (5, 2) seems strategically better as it moves towards the apples and keeps more movement options open for the next step (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#A SSAA#\n#SSSS  #\n#  SS  #\n#  SS  #\n# H S  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 47\n\nMy current position (Head 'H') is at row 5, column 2 (0-indexed from top-left).\nMy current direction is UP.\nI cannot move DOWN (reversing direction).\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  Move UP: The cell at (4, 2) is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  Move LEFT: The cell at (5, 1) is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The cell at (5, 3) is occupied by my body ('S'). This is an invalid move (collision).\n\nI need to choose between UP and LEFT.\nThe apples are located at (1, 1), (1, 5), and (1, 6). Moving UP or LEFT brings me closer to the apples in the upper part of the board.\n\nLet's analyze the consequences:\n- If I move UP to (4, 2):\n    - My head will be at (4, 2).\n    - My body will shift. The tail ('S' at (6, 4)) will disappear, and the old head position (5, 2) will become 'S'.\n    - From (4, 2), moving UP, my next possible moves would be UP (to 3, 2), LEFT (to 4, 1), or RIGHT (to 4, 3 - collision with 'S'). Both UP and LEFT lead to open space.\n- If I move LEFT to (5, 1):\n    - My head will be at (5, 1).\n    - My body will shift similarly.\n    - From (5, 1), moving LEFT, my next possible moves would be UP (to 4, 1), LEFT (to 5, 0 - wall collision), or DOWN (to 6, 1). Moving UP or DOWN leads to open space initially, but moving DOWN quickly leads to being trapped against the wall and body.\n\nMoving UP seems slightly safer as it keeps me away from the left wall immediately and offers clear paths (UP or LEFT) in the subsequent step, both leading towards the general area of the apples. Moving LEFT leads to a position where the next move options are UP or DOWN, and DOWN leads to a potential trap.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#A SSAA#\n# SSS  #\n#  SS  #\n# HSS  #\n# S S  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 48\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 2).\nThe current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction.

The snake's head 'H' is at (1, 3) and the body 'S' is at (2, 3).\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: The head would move to (0, 3), which is a wall '#'. This leads to game over.\n2.  DOWN: This is the reverse of the current direction (UP), which is not allowed.\n3.  LEFT: The head would move to (1, 2), which is empty ' '. This is a valid move.

The body segments are at (1, 2) and (1, 3).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nPossible moves:\n1.  Continue LEFT: The snake head would move to (1, 0), which is a wall ('#'). This would end the game.\n2.  Turn UP: The snake head would move to (0, 1), which is a wall ('#'). This would end the game.\n3.  Turn DOWN: The snake head would move to (2, 1), which is an empty space. This is a valid move.\n4.  Turn RIGHT: This is reversing the current direction (LEFT), which is not allowed.\n\nThe only valid move that does not result in immediate game over is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n# SS   #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake's head is at (row 2, col 2).\nThe snake's body is at (row 1, col 2) and (row 1, col 3).\nThe apples are at (row 5, col 4), (row 6, col 3), and (row 6, col 5).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  DOWN: Move head to (3, 2). This is an empty space. Valid.\n2.  LEFT: Move head to (2, 1). This is an empty space. Valid.\n3.  RIGHT: Move head to (2, 3). This is an empty space. Valid.\n4.  UP: Invalid, as the snake cannot reverse direction.\n\nEvaluating the valid moves:\n- Moving DOWN positions the snake closer to the cluster of apples at the bottom. The next position (3, 2) is safe.\n- Moving LEFT positions the snake at (2, 1). This moves away from the apples. The position is safe.\n- Moving RIGHT positions the snake at (2, 3). This moves away from the apples. The position is safe.\n\nTo maximize the score, the snake should move towards the apples. Moving DOWN is the most direct path towards the apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 9\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 1).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN (UP is forbidden).\n- Moving LEFT leads to a collision with the wall at (3, 0).\n- Moving RIGHT leads to an empty space at (3, 2).\n- Moving DOWN leads to an empty space at (4, 1).\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN are safe moves. Moving RIGHT positions the snake closer horizontally to the apples. Moving DOWN moves the snake vertically. To reach the nearest apple cluster, moving RIGHT first allows for subsequent DOWN moves towards the apples at (5,3), (6,2), and (6,4).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n# S    #\n# SH   #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#  A A #\n########\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# SS   #\n#  H   #\n#   A  #\n#  A A #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 3). The current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (4, 2). This square is empty and valid. It moves away from the apples.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (4, 4). This square is empty and valid. It moves closer to the apple at (5, 4).\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (5, 3). This square is empty and valid. It moves closer to the apples at (5, 4) and (6, 3).\n\nMoving DOWN positions the snake directly above the apple at (6, 3) and next to the apple at (5, 4), offering immediate opportunities to eat in the next step (by moving DOWN or RIGHT). Moving RIGHT also allows eating the apple at (5, 4) in the next step (by moving DOWN). Moving DOWN seems slightly better as it maintains proximity to two apples.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#  HA  #\n#  A A #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 12\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 3). The current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so moving UP is not allowed.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (5, 2). This square is empty and safe. The snake does not eat an apple.\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (5, 4). This square contains an apple ('A'). The snake eats the apple, the score increases by 1, and the snake grows longer. The new head position is (5, 4), and the body segments will be at (5, 3), (4, 3), and (3, 3). This move is safe.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head moves to (6, 3). This square is empty and safe. The snake does not eat an apple.\n\nComparing the moves:\n-   LEFT moves away from the nearby apples.\n-   RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. After eating the apple at (5, 4), the new head position will be (5, 4), the direction will be RIGHT. The possible next moves will be UP (to 4, 4 - safe) or DOWN (to 6, 4 - another apple). This seems like a good move.\n-   DOWN moves the head to (6, 3). From there, the next move could be LEFT (to 6, 2 - apple) or RIGHT (to 6, 4 - apple). This path also leads to apples but doesn't score immediately.\n\nEating an apple immediately (moving RIGHT) is the most advantageous move as it increases the score and length, and sets up a potential next move to eat another apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#  SH A#\n#  A A #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 13\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 4) (row 5, column 4, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies (5, 3), (4, 3), and (3, 3).\nApples 'A' are at (5, 6), (6, 3), and (6, 5).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\n\nThe player cannot move LEFT as it's the direct opposite of the current direction.\nThe possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (4, 4). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move. It moves the snake away from the nearby apples.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (6, 4). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move. This positions the head adjacent to apples at (6, 3) and (6, 5).\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (5, 5). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move. This positions the head adjacent to apples at (5, 6) and (6, 5).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT position the snake well for eating apples in the next step. Moving RIGHT maintains the current horizontal momentum and places the head (5,5) adjacent to two apples (5,6 and 6,5). Moving DOWN places the head (6,4) adjacent to two apples (6,3 and 6,5). Both seem like good strategies. Let's choose to continue RIGHT, aiming for the apple at (5,6) or (6,5).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  SSHA#\n#  A A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 5).

This square is a wall ('#'). This move leads to collision.\n4.  **LEFT:** This move is not allowed because the snake is currently moving RIGHT, and it cannot reverse direction. Even if it were allowed, moving LEFT would cause a collision with the snake's body at (5, 5).\n\nThe only valid and safe move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     H#\n#  SSSS#\n#  A AA#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nAnalyze the current situation:\n1.  The snake's head 'H' is at (4, 5).\n2.  The snake's body 'S' occupies (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2).\n3.  The current direction is UP.\n4.  Apples 'A' are at (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5).\n5.  The snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\n6.  Moving RIGHT to (4, 6) would hit the wall '#'.\n\nPossible next moves:\n*   UP: Move head to (3, 5). This square is empty. Valid.\n*   LEFT: Move head to (4, 4). This square is empty. Valid.\n\nEvaluating the moves:\n*   Move UP: The head moves to (3, 5).

The possible moves from (3, 5) would be UP, LEFT (RIGHT hits wall).\n*   Move LEFT: The head moves to (4, 4). The board becomes:\n    ```\n    ########\n    #      #\n    #      #\n    #      #\n    #    H S#\n    #  SSS #\n    #  A AA#\n    ########\n    ```\n    This move is safe. The possible moves from (4, 4) would be UP, LEFT, DOWN. However, moving DOWN to (5, 4) in the next step would result in a collision with the snake's body part currently at (5, 4). This limits downward movement towards the apples immediately.\n\nComparing UP and LEFT: Moving UP maintains flexibility and allows planning a route towards the apples below. Moving LEFT immediately restricts the option to move DOWN in the subsequent step. Therefore, moving UP is the better strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     H#\n#     S#\n#   SSS#\n#  A AA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 17\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 6).

Move LEFT: Head moves to (3, 5). This is an empty space. Valid.\n3.  Move RIGHT: Head moves to (3, 7). This is a wall '#'. Invalid (collision).\n\nWe need to choose between UP and LEFT.\nThe apples are located at (6, 2), (6, 4), and (6, 5). The snake's head is at (3, 6).\n- If we move UP to (2, 6), the distance to the nearest apple (6, 5) becomes |2-6| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n- If we move LEFT to (3, 5), the distance to the nearest apple (6, 5) becomes |3-6| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3.\n\nMoving LEFT brings the snake closer to the cluster of apples. It is also a safe move, as position (3, 5) is empty and not occupied by the snake's body after the move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    HS#\n#     S#\n#    SS#\n#  A AA#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 18\n\nMy goal is to move the snake towards the apples ('A') while avoiding collisions with the walls ('#') and the snake's own body ('S'). The snake is currently moving LEFT, so I cannot choose RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Analyze Current State:**\n    *   Snake Head (H): (3, 4)\n    *   Snake Body (S): (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)\n    *   Apples (A): (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)\n    *   Current Direction: LEFT\n\n2.  **Evaluate Possible Moves:**\n    *   **UP:** Move head to (2, 4). This square is empty. Valid move.\n    *   **DOWN:** Move head to (4, 4). This square is empty. Valid move.\n    *   **LEFT:** Move head to (3, 3). This square is empty. Valid move.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Invalid move, as the snake is moving LEFT.\n\n3.  **Compare Valid Moves:**\n    *   **DOWN:** Moves head to (4, 4). The next possible moves from (4,4) with direction DOWN would be LEFT (to 4,3 - safe), RIGHT (to 4,5 - body collision), DOWN (to 5,4 - body collision). This path forces the snake LEFT immediately after. Following this path leads towards A(6,2).\n    *   **UP:** Moves head to (2, 4). This move offers more flexibility for subsequent turns (LEFT, RIGHT, UP are possible next). A path UP -> LEFT -> DOWN... leads towards the apples.\n    *   **LEFT:** Moves head to (3, 3). This move also offers flexibility (UP, LEFT, DOWN are possible next). A path LEFT -> DOWN -> DOWN -> DOWN -> RIGHT allows eating A(6,4) and then potentially A(6,5). This seems like a good strategy.\n\n4.  **Decision:** Moving LEFT is a safe move that is part of a clear path towards eating multiple apples efficiently. It allows maneuvering downwards towards the cluster of apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   HSS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#  A AA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at coordinates (3, 3).\nThe snake's body (S) occupies (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), and (5, 5).\nThe apples (A) are at (6, 2), (6, 4), and (6, 5).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\n\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move RIGHT.\nThe possible next moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT**: The head would move to (3, 2). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a safe move.\n2.  **Move UP**: The head would move to (2, 3). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a safe move.\n3.  **Move DOWN**: The head would move to (4, 3). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a safe move.\n\nAll three moves are safe. The goal is to eat the apples. The apples are located in row 6. Moving DOWN brings the snake's head closer to the row containing the apples. Moving DOWN to (4, 3) is a step towards the apples at (6, 2), (6, 4), and (6, 5). Therefore, DOWN is a good strategic move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSS#\n#   H S#\n#      #\n#  A AA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 3).

Valid move.\n\nAll three moves are safe (no collision with walls or self).\nThe apples are located at (6, 2), (6, 4), and (6, 5).\nMoving DOWN to (5, 3) brings the snake's head closer vertically to the row containing the apples. From (5, 3), the snake can move DOWN again to (6, 3) and then easily access the apples at (6, 2) or (6, 4).\nMoving LEFT or RIGHT keeps the head on the same row (row 4), slightly further from the apples vertically.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is a good strategy to approach the apples efficiently.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSS#\n#   S  #\n#   H  #\n#  A AA#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake head is at position (5, 3). The current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move UP.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n1.  **Check Move LEFT:**\n    - New head position: (5, 2).\n    - Is it a wall ('#')? No.\n    - Is it the snake body ('S')? No.\n    - This move is valid.\n\n2.  **Check Move RIGHT:**\n    - New head position: (5, 4).\n    - Is it a wall ('#')? No.\n    - Is it the snake body ('S')?

No.\n    - This move is valid.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the valid moves strategically:\n- Apples are located at (6, 2), (6, 4), and (6, 5).\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 2) positions the snake to potentially move DOWN to eat the apple at (6, 2) in the next step.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 4) positions the snake to potentially move DOWN to eat the apple at (6, 4) in the next step.\n- Moving DOWN to (6, 3) moves the snake to the same row as the apples, positioning it between the apples at (6, 2) and (6, 4), allowing a choice to eat either in the next step (by moving LEFT or RIGHT).\n\nAll three moves are safe and lead towards apples. Continuing DOWN moves the head directly to the row with apples and places it centrally between two of them, offering flexibility for the next move. This seems like a reasonable strategy.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#  AHAA#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 22\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 3). The current direction is DOWN.\nIf the snake continues DOWN, it will hit the wall at (7, 3).\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so moving UP is not allowed.\nMoving RIGHT would lead to a collision with the snake's body at (6, 4).\nMoving LEFT leads the head to (6, 2), which contains an apple. This is a safe move and allows the snake to eat an apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A SS #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#  HSAA#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at coordinates (6, 2) (row 6, column 2, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe snake's body segments are at (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 5), (3, 4).\nApples are at (3, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6).\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  **UP**: Move head to (5, 2). This square is empty. It is a valid move.\n2.  **DOWN**: Move head to (7, 2). This square is a wall ('#'). This is an invalid move (collision).\n3.  **LEFT**: Move head to (6, 1). This square is empty. It is a valid move.\n\nWe need to choose between UP and LEFT.\n- Moving LEFT takes the head to (6, 1). This is closer horizontally to the apple at (3, 1). The path to this apple would likely be LEFT, then UP, UP, UP.\n- Moving UP takes the head to (5, 2). The path to the apple at (3, 1) would likely be UP, then LEFT, UP, UP.\n\nBoth moves are safe in the short term. Moving LEFT continues the current direction and positions the snake along the left side, allowing a straight path upwards towards the apple at (3,1). This seems like a reasonable strategy.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A S  #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n# HSSAA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6, 1).

This move leads to a collision and game over.\n3.  **Move RIGHT**: The head moves to (5, 2). This square is empty. This is a safe move.\n\nComparing the safe moves (UP and RIGHT):\nMoving UP positions the head at (4, 1), one step away from the apple at (3, 1).\nMoving RIGHT positions the head at (5, 2), away from the nearest apple and closer to its own body.\n\nThe best move is UP, as it is safe and progresses towards eating an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# H    #\n# S S  #\n# SSSAA#\n########\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n# H    #\n# S    #\n# S S  #\n# SSSAA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (3, 1).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so DOWN is not allowed.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.

Check move RIGHT: The position (3, 2) is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nWe have two valid moves: UP and RIGHT.\nThe apples 'A' are at (1, 5), (6, 5), and (6, 6).\nThe closest apple is at (1, 5).\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance to the apple at (1, 5) from the potential next positions:\n- If move UP to (2, 1): Distance = |1 - 2| + |5 - 1| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n- If move RIGHT to (3, 2): Distance = |1 - 3| + |5 - 2| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nBoth moves are equally close to the apple at (1, 5).\nMoving UP takes the snake towards the top edge and towards the apple at (1,5). It also moves away from the bulk of the snake's body in the lower part of the board.\nMoving RIGHT also moves towards the apple at (1,5) but keeps the snake more in the middle rows.\n\nConsidering the position of the body segments below and to the right, moving UP seems like a slightly safer option, providing more space for future maneuvers towards the apple.\n\nTherefore, I choose UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#    A #\n# H    #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# SSSAA#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 28\n\nMy goal is to move towards the nearest apple while avoiding collisions with walls or the snake's body.\nThe snake's head is at (2, 2). The current direction is UP.\nThe apples are at (1, 5), (6, 6), and (6, 7). The nearest apple is at (1, 5).\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is forbidden as it's the reverse of UP).\n\n1.  **Move UP:** Head moves to (1, 2). This position is empty (' '). It is a safe move and moves the snake closer to the apple at (1, 5) (same row).\n2.  **Move LEFT:** Head moves to (2, 1). This position is empty (' '). It is a safe move but moves away from the apple at (1, 5).\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** Head moves to (2, 3). This position is empty (' '). It is a safe move and moves towards the column of the apple at (1, 5).\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT move towards the nearest apple. Moving UP gets the head to the same row as the apple. Moving RIGHT gets the head closer horizontally. Let's trace the path after moving UP: Head at (1, 2), direction UP. The next best move would be RIGHT to (1, 3), then RIGHT to (1, 4), then RIGHT to (1, 5) to eat the apple. This path seems safe.\n\nLet's trace the path after moving RIGHT: Head at (2, 3), direction RIGHT. Possible next moves are UP, RIGHT (LEFT leads to collision with (2,2)). Moving UP to (1, 3) seems best, then RIGHT to (1, 4), then RIGHT to (1, 5) to eat the apple. This path also seems safe.\n\nMoving UP seems slightly more direct as it immediately aligns the snake with the apple's row.\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n# H  A #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# SS AA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 29\n\nThe snake's head is at row 1, column 1 (inside the walls).\nThe current direction is UP.\nMoving UP would cause a collision with the top wall '#'.\nMoving DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse of UP.\nMoving LEFT would cause a collision with the left wall '#'.\nMoving RIGHT moves the head to an empty space (row 1, column 2).

The snake's head 'H' is at position (1, 3).\n2.  The snake's body 'S' occupies (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2).\n3.  The current direction is RIGHT.\n4.  Apples 'A' are at (1, 5), (6, 5), and (6, 6).\n5.  The snake cannot reverse direction, so moving LEFT is invalid (would collide with body anyway).\n6.  Moving UP would lead to (0, 3), which is a wall '#'. Collision.\n7.  Moving DOWN would lead to (2, 3), which is an empty space. Valid move.\n8.  Moving RIGHT would lead to (1, 4), which is an empty space. Valid move.\n\nComparing valid moves:\n-   Moving DOWN takes the snake to (2, 3). This moves the snake towards the lower part of the board where two apples are located, but doesn't eat an apple immediately.\n-   Moving RIGHT takes the snake to (1, 4). From this position, the next move RIGHT would lead to eating the apple at (1, 5).\n\nChoosing RIGHT positions the snake to eat an apple in the very next step. This is generally a good strategy in Snake.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n# SSHA #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n#    AA#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 31\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 5) and the current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n1.

Check LEFT: The current direction is RIGHT, so LEFT is reversing direction. Invalid move.\n4.  Check RIGHT: The position (1, 6) contains an apple 'A'.

Score increases. Snake grows to length 8. New direction: RIGHT.\n\nEating the apple immediately (RIGHT) increases the score and seems safe. The space to the right contains an apple. Moving right will consume the apple, increase the score, and increase the snake's length. The next mandatory move from (1, 6) would be DOWN to (2, 6), which is also a safe square. This path allows the snake to continue towards the apples at the bottom.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n# SSSH #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# S A  #\n#    AA#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 32\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\nThe snake's head is at (Row 1, Col 5).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\n1. Moving RIGHT: The snake would hit the wall at (Row 1, Col 6). Game Over.\n2. Moving LEFT: This is the opposite of the current direction (RIGHT), so it's an invalid move. Even if allowed, it would hit the snake's body at (Row 1, Col 4). Game Over.\n3. Moving UP: The snake would hit the wall at (Row 0, Col 5). Game Over.\n4. Moving DOWN: The snake would move to (Row 2, Col 5), which is an empty space. This is a valid and safe move.\n\nThe only possible safe move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n# SSSS #\n# S  H #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n#   A  #\n#    AA#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 5) (row 2, column 5, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe snake's body 'S' occupies positions (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2).\nApples 'A' are at (5, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  Continue DOWN: The head would move to (3, 5). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n2.  Turn LEFT: The head would move to (2, 4). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n3.  Turn RIGHT: The head would move to (2, 6). This square is a wall '#'. This move leads to game over.\n4.  Turn UP: This is the reverse of the current direction (DOWN), so it's an invalid move.\n\nWe need to choose between DOWN and LEFT. Let's analyze the consequences:\n-   Move DOWN: Head moves to (3, 5). This position is closer to the apples located in the lower part of the board, especially the one at (6, 5). A sequence of DOWN moves (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN) leads directly to the apple at (6, 5).\n-   Move LEFT: Head moves to (2, 4). From here, the snake can turn DOWN or continue LEFT to approach the apples at (5, 3) or (6, 4). For example, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN reaches the apple at (5, 3).\n\nMoving DOWN brings the snake closer to the apple at (6, 5) in fewer steps (3 more moves) compared to moving LEFT which leads to the apple at (5, 3) in more steps (4 more moves). Therefore, moving DOWN is the preferred strategy to reach an apple quickly.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n# SSSS #\n# S  S #\n# S  H #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#    AA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head is at row 3, column 6 (H).

This is a valid move.\n\nNow let's evaluate the moves based on proximity to apples and safety.\nApples are at (5, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5).\n\n*   **Move LEFT:** Head at (4, 4). Next possible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN. Moving DOWN to (5, 4) gets closer to apples at (5, 3) and (6, 4).\n*   **Move RIGHT:** Head at (4, 6). Next possible moves are RIGHT, UP, DOWN. Moving DOWN to (5, 6) gets closer to the apple at (6, 5). Moving RIGHT hits a wall.\n*   **Move DOWN:** Head at (5, 5). Next possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. Moving DOWN to (6, 5) eats an apple immediately. Moving LEFT to (5, 4) gets closer to apples at (5, 3) and (6, 4).\n\nMoving DOWN allows the snake to potentially eat the apple at (6, 5) in the next step. This seems like the most direct path to an apple. Let's check if moving DOWN leads to an immediate trap. After moving DOWN, the head is at (5, 5). From there, the snake can move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving DOWN eats the apple at (6, 5). Moving LEFT goes to (5, 4), closer to other apples. Moving RIGHT goes to (5, 6). None of these immediate next steps lead to a collision.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is a good strategic move as it leads directly towards an apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n# SSSS #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#   AH #\n#    AA#\n########\n```\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake's head is at (5, 6).\nThe possible next positions are:\n1.

Move UP: The snake's head 'H' is at (5, 2). Moving UP would move it to (4, 2). This square contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move as it's not reversing direction (LEFT -> UP). Eating the apple increases the snake's length. The path ahead seems potentially tricky after eating this apple.\n2.  Move DOWN: Moving DOWN would move the head to (6, 2). This square is empty. This is a valid move.\n3.  Move LEFT: The snake is already moving LEFT. Continuing LEFT moves the head to (5, 1). This square contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move. Eating the apple increases the snake's length.\n4.  Move RIGHT: This move is invalid because the snake is currently moving LEFT, and it cannot reverse direction.\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n- Moving UP eats an apple at (4, 2).\n- Moving LEFT eats an apple at (5, 1).\n- Moving DOWN does not eat an apple.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT lead to eating an apple immediately. Let's consider the move LEFT.\n- Move LEFT to (5, 1). Eat apple. Direction: LEFT. Length increases.\n- Next possible moves: UP to (4, 1) (empty) or DOWN to (6, 1) (empty).\n    - If UP to (4, 1), next move is RIGHT to (4, 2), which is the other apple. This seems like a good sequence to eat two apples.\n\nLet's consider the move UP.\n- Move UP to (4, 2). Eat apple. Direction: UP. Length increases.\n- Next possible move: LEFT to (4, 1) (empty) or RIGHT to (4, 3) (body 'S'). Must move LEFT.\n- Head is at (4, 1). Direction: LEFT.\n- Next possible moves: UP to (3, 1) (empty) or DOWN to (5, 1) (apple). Eating the apple at (5, 1) seems to lead to a forced collision later. Must move UP.\n\nThe path starting with LEFT seems slightly better as it allows capturing two apples relatively quickly with seemingly safe follow-up moves.\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n########\n#   SS #\n#  A S #\n#    S #\n#  A S #\n# HSSS #\n#   SSA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1.  Move UP: The snake's head would move from (5, 1) to (4, 1). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. This move positions the snake adjacent to the apple at (4, 2).\n2.  Move DOWN: The snake's head would move from (5, 1) to (6, 1). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  Move LEFT: The snake's head would move from (5, 1) to (5, 0). This square is a wall ('#'). This move would result in a collision.\n4.  Move RIGHT: The snake cannot move RIGHT because the current direction is LEFT (cannot reverse direction).\n\nComparing valid moves UP and DOWN:\n- Moving UP positions the head at (4, 1). The next move could be RIGHT to eat the apple at (4, 2).\n- Moving DOWN positions the head at (6, 1). From there, moving RIGHT leads to a collision with the snake's body at (6, 2), moving LEFT leads to a wall collision, and moving DOWN leads to a wall collision. Moving DOWN leads to a dead end.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP to survive and position the snake to eat the nearby apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#    S #\n#  A S #\n#    S #\n# HA S #\n# SSSS #\n#   SSA#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 2). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (cannot move DOWN because it's the reverse of UP).\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (3, 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move. It moves the snake closer to the apple at (2, 2).\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (4, 1). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (4, 3). This square contains 'S' (snake body). This would cause a collision. This is an invalid move.\n\nComparing the valid moves:\n- UP: Safe, moves towards the apple at (2, 2). The next move UP would eat the apple.\n- LEFT: Safe, but moves away from the nearest apple initially.\n\nMoving UP is the most direct path to the closest apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A S #\n# H  S #\n# SA S #\n# SSSS #\n#   SSA#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 43\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  The snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (3, 1) (row 3, column 1, using 0-based indexing for the playable area).\n2.  The current direction is UP.\n3.  The snake cannot move DOWN, as that would be reversing direction.\n4.  Possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n5.  Check potential collisions for each possible move:\n    *   Move UP: The head would move to (2, 1). This cell is empty (' '). This move is safe.\n    *   Move LEFT: The head would move to (3, 0). This cell is empty (' '). This move is safe.\n    *   Move RIGHT: The head would move to (3, 2). This cell is empty (' '). This move is safe.\n6.  Evaluate the moves strategically:\n    *   UP: Moves to (2, 1). This positions the snake adjacent to the apple 'A' at (2, 2). The next move could be RIGHT to eat the apple.\n    *   LEFT: Moves to (3, 0). This moves the snake away from the nearest apples.\n    *   RIGHT: Moves to (3, 2). This positions the snake adjacent to the apple 'A' at (2, 2) and the apple 'A' at (4, 2). The next move could be UP to eat the apple at (2, 2) or DOWN to eat the apple at (4, 2). However, moving DOWN would place the head at (4, 2) next to snake body parts 'S' at (4, 1) and (4, 3), which could be risky.\n7.  Comparing UP and RIGHT: Moving UP leads to a position (2, 1) from where eating the apple at (2, 2) via a RIGHT turn seems straightforward. Moving RIGHT leads to (3, 2), offering access to two apples but potentially riskier immediate follow-up moves. Moving UP seems like a safer approach to target the nearest apple.\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n# HA   #\n# S  S #\n# SA S #\n# SSSS #\n#   SSA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nOkay, let's analyze the possible moves:\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The snake's head is at (3, 2). Moving UP would place the head at (2, 3). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid and safe move. It positions the head next to the apple at (2, 4).\n2.  **Move DOWN:** This is not allowed because the current direction is UP (cannot reverse direction).\n3.  **Move LEFT:** The snake's head is at (3, 2). Moving LEFT would place the head at (3, 1). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid and safe move.\n4.  **Move RIGHT:** The snake's head is at (3, 2). Moving RIGHT would place the head at (3, 3). This square contains a snake body part ('S'). This move would result in a collision and end the game.\n\nComparing the valid moves (UP and LEFT):\n*   Moving UP to (2, 3) puts the snake in a position where the next move (RIGHT) will eat the apple at (2, 4).\n*   Moving LEFT to (3, 1) moves the snake further away from the closest apple.\n\nTherefore, moving UP is the best strategic move as it sets up eating an apple in the next turn.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n# H    #\n# SA   #\n# S    #\n# SA S #\n# SSSS #\n#   SSA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 2).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot continue UP as it would hit the wall at (0, 2).\nThe snake cannot move DOWN as it would be reversing its direction.\nThe snake can move LEFT to (1, 1), which is an empty space.\nThe snake can move RIGHT to (1, 3), which is an empty space.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n1.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (1, 1). The space is clear. This keeps the snake on the left side of the board.\n2.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (1, 3). The space is clear. This moves the snake towards the center\/right side of the board, closer to the available space and potentially the apples at (2, 4) and (4, 3).\n\nMoving RIGHT seems slightly better as it opens up more space and potential paths towards apples without immediate danger.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n# SH   #\n# SA   #\n# S    #\n# SA   #\n# SSSS #\n#   SSA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 46\n\nThe snake's head is at position (1, 3).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move LEFT.\nLet's check the other three possible moves:\n1.  Move UP: The position (0, 3) is a wall ('#'). This move leads to collision and game over.\n2.  Move DOWN: The position (2, 3) is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This move leads to collision and game over.\n3.  Move RIGHT: The position (1, 4) is empty (' ').

This move leads to game over.\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (3, 4). This position is empty ' '. This is a valid move. The snake does not eat an apple.\n3.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (2, 3). This position is empty ' '. This is a valid move. The snake does not eat an apple immediately, but it positions the snake to potentially eat the apple at (2, 2) on the next turn by moving LEFT again.\n\nComparing options:\n- Moving DOWN keeps the snake moving away from the nearby apple at (2, 2).\n- Moving LEFT positions the snake to eat the apple at (2, 2) in the subsequent move. This seems like a better strategy to increase the score. Let's check if moving LEFT leads to an immediate trap. After moving LEFT, the head will be at (2, 3), and the direction will be LEFT. The snake can then move LEFT again to eat the apple at (2, 2). After eating the apple, the head is at (2, 2), direction is LEFT. The next possible moves are UP (blocked by S), DOWN (to (3, 2), safe), LEFT (blocked by S). So, moving DOWN is possible after eating the apple.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is a safe and strategically advantageous move towards eating an apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n# SSS  #\n# SHS  #\n# S    #\n# SA   #\n# SSS  #\n# A S A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 49\n\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake's head is at (2, 3).\nPossible moves:\n- Moving LEFT would hit the body segment at (2, 2).

This is a valid move.\n\nWe need to choose between DOWN and RIGHT.\n- Moving DOWN to (4, 4): The snake would then be facing DOWN. Apples are at (4, 2), (6, 1), (6, 5). The apple at (4, 2) is close, but requires turning LEFT twice, potentially boxing the snake in near its own body.\n- Moving RIGHT to (3, 5): The snake would then be facing RIGHT. Apples are at (4, 2), (6, 1), (6, 5). The apple at (6, 5) is relatively close and in a more open area to the right and bottom. This path seems safer and provides more space for maneuvering after potentially eating the apple.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is the preferred option.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n# SSS  #\n# SSS  #\n# SSSH #\n# SA   #\n# S    #\n# A   A#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 52\n\nBased on the current board and rules:\nThe snake's head is at coordinates (3, 6) (row 3, column 6, 0-indexed from top-left inside the walls).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move LEFT.\nLet's check the other possible moves:\n1.  **UP:** Moving UP would lead to coordinate (2, 6), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S').

This would cause a wall collision, so RIGHT is not a valid move.\n3.  **DOWN:** Moving DOWN would lead to coordinate (4, 6), which is an empty space (' ').

Future moves could be DOWN, then LEFT. Seems safe.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 5): No immediate apple. The closest apple is at (6, 5). Future moves could be DOWN to eat the apple. Seems safe and leads towards an apple.\n- Moving DOWN to (6, 4): No immediate apple. This position is between two apples at (6, 1) and (6, 5). The next move could be LEFT towards (6, 1) or RIGHT towards (6, 5). This seems like a flexible and safe move, positioning the snake to easily reach either bottom apple.\n\nComparing the options, moving DOWN keeps the options open for two apples in the next step. Moving RIGHT commits to the apple on the right. Moving LEFT requires more steps to reach an apple.

The current direction is UP.\nThe possible moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse of UP.\n1.  Move UP: The head moves to (3, 3). This is an empty square (' '). It's a safe move. This move brings the snake closer to all three apples.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (4, 2). This is an empty square (' '). It's a safe move. This move brings the snake closer to the apples at (1, 2) and (1, 3).\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (4, 4). This is an empty square (' '). It's a safe move. This move brings the snake closer to the apple at (2, 4).\n\nMoving UP seems like a good strategic move as it positions the snake more centrally to approach the group of apples in the rows above. It reduces the distance to the nearest apples effectively.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 3).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head moves to (2, 3). This is an empty space, so it's a valid move. The new position is closer to the apples at (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 4).\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (3, 2). This is an empty space, so it's a valid move. This moves away from the closest apples.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head moves to (3, 4). This is an empty space, so it's a valid move. This moves the snake towards the apple at (2, 4).\n\nMoving UP positions the snake at (2, 3), from where it can choose to move UP again to eat the apple at (1, 3) or move RIGHT to eat the apple at (2, 4) in the next step. Moving RIGHT positions the snake at (3, 4), from where it can move UP to eat the apple at (2, 4) in the next step. Both UP and RIGHT are good moves towards apples. Moving UP targets the central cluster of apples slightly better.\n\nLet's choose UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n```\n########\n#  AA  #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 3).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN because it's the reverse direction.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  Move UP: The head moves to (2, 3). This position is empty (' '). It is a safe move. From (2, 3), moving UP again will reach the apple 'A' at (1, 3).\n2.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (3, 2). This position is empty (' '). It is a safe move. From (3, 2), moving UP leads towards the apple at (1, 2).\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (3, 4). This position is empty (' '). It is a safe move. From (3, 4), moving UP leads towards the apple at (2, 5).\n\nMoving UP positions the snake directly below the apple at (1, 3), making it reachable in the next step. This seems like the most direct path to the nearest cluster of apples.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#  HA  #\n#  S A #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 3). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are LEFT and RIGHT. Moving UP would hit the wall. Moving DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n\n1.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (1, 2). The space is empty. Safe move.\n2.  Move RIGHT: Head moves to (1, 4). This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is beneficial. Safe move.\n\nEating the apple is the primary objective. Therefore, moving RIGHT is the best move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  SH A#\n#  S A #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (1, 5) (row 1, column 5, 0-indexed from top-left).\nThe snake's body 'S' is at (1, 3) and (2, 3).\nApples 'A' are at (1, 6), (2, 5), and (4, 4).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  **UP:** Move to (0, 5). This is a wall '#'. Collision - Game Over.\n2.  **DOWN:** Move to (2, 5). This square contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move. The snake eats the apple and grows.\n3.  **LEFT:** Cannot move LEFT because the current direction is RIGHT (reversing direction is forbidden).\n4.  **RIGHT:** Move to (1, 6). This square contains an apple 'A'. This is a valid move. The snake eats the apple and grows.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are valid moves that result in eating an apple immediately. Let's evaluate the positions after each move:\n*   If move DOWN: Head moves to (2, 5). Snake eats apple. Snake becomes H(2,5), S(1,5), S(1,3). Next moves possible: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. Apple at (1, 6) is reachable UP then RIGHT (not immediately), apple at (4, 4) is reachable via DOWN moves.\n*   If move RIGHT: Head moves to (1, 6). Snake eats apple. Snake becomes H(1,6), S(1,5), S(1,3). Next moves possible: DOWN. Apple at (2, 5) is reachable by moving DOWN then LEFT. Apple at (4, 4) is also reachable.\n\nBoth moves are good as they capture an apple. Choosing RIGHT seems slightly more constrained initially (only DOWN is possible next) but sets up for the apple at (2, 5) quickly. Let's choose RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#  SSHA#\n#    A #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nThe snake's head is at (1, 5) (row 1, column 5).\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\nThe snake's body is at (1, 4) and (1, 3).\nApples are at (1, 6), (2, 4), and (4, 4).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move to (0, 5). This is a wall ('#'). Collision. Invalid.\n2.  DOWN: Move to (2, 5). This is an empty space (' '). Valid.\n3.  LEFT: Move to (1, 4). This is the snake's body ('S'). Collision. Invalid. Also, reversing direction (RIGHT to LEFT) is not allowed.\n4.  RIGHT: Move to (1, 6). This is an apple ('A'). Valid. Eating the apple.\n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple immediately, increasing the score and length. The space is safe.\nMoving DOWN is also a safe move but doesn't eat an apple immediately.\n\nEating the apple is generally the primary goal. Let's check if eating the apple leads to an immediate problem. If we move RIGHT:\n- New head position: (1, 6)\n- New body positions: (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3)\n- New board state (conceptually):\n########\n#  SSSH#\n#    A #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n- The direction is now RIGHT.\n- From (1, 6), possible moves are: UP (wall), DOWN (safe, to 2, 6), LEFT (body collision), RIGHT (wall).\n- The only valid move after eating the apple is DOWN. This move is safe and moves towards the other apples.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to eat the apple is the best move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#A SSSH#\n#    A #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nBased on the current board and rules:\n- The snake head 'H' is at position (1, 6).\n- The snake body 'S' occupies (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3).\n- The current direction is RIGHT.\n- The snake cannot move LEFT (reverse direction).\n- Moving UP would hit the wall at (0, 6).\n- Moving RIGHT would hit the wall at (1, 7).\n- Moving DOWN would move the head to (2, 6), which is an empty space.\n\nTherefore, the only safe move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#A  SSS#\n#    AH#\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 6). The current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot turn UP (reverse direction).\nPossible moves:\n1.  Continue DOWN: Move to (3, 6). This cell is empty. Valid.\n2.  Turn LEFT: Move to (2, 5). This cell contains an apple 'A'. Valid. Eating the apple will increase the score and snake length.\n3.  Turn RIGHT: Move to (2, 7). This cell is a wall '#'. Invalid (collision).\n\nComparing valid moves:\n- Moving DOWN to (3, 6) is safe but doesn't yield an immediate score increase.\n- Moving LEFT to (2, 5) allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score and length. This is generally the preferred strategy in Snake. After moving LEFT, the head will be at (2, 5), and the snake will have grown. The position seems safe, with paths available (e.g., LEFT to (2, 4) or DOWN to (3, 5)).\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#A  SSS#\n#    HS#\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 9\n\nMy current position (H) is at row 2, column 4 (0-indexed from top-left inside the walls). The current direction is LEFT.\nPossible moves:\n1.  Continue LEFT: Move to (2, 3). This square is empty. Valid.\n2.  Turn UP: Move to (1, 4). This square contains 'S' (snake body). Invalid move (collision).\n3.  Turn DOWN: Move to (3, 4). This square is empty. Valid.\n4.  Turn RIGHT: Cannot reverse direction from LEFT to RIGHT. Invalid move.\n\nI have two valid moves: LEFT and DOWN.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n-   Moving LEFT to (2, 3) moves me further away from the apple at (4, 4) but closer to the apple at (1, 1).\n-   Moving DOWN to (3, 4) moves me directly towards the apple at (4, 4). From (3, 4), I can move DOWN again to eat the apple at (4, 4). This seems like a more direct path to an apple.\n\nChoosing DOWN seems like a better strategy as it leads to eating an apple in two steps and positions the snake towards the lower, more open part of the board where another apple exists.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#A   SS#\n#    SS#\n#    H #\n#    A #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 10\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head is at (3, 5).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n1.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (3, 4). This square is empty (' '). It is a safe move.\n2.  Move RIGHT: Head moves to (3, 6). This square contains the snake's body ('S'). This move leads to collision and game over.\n3.  Move DOWN: Head moves to (4, 5). This square contains an apple ('A'). This move is safe, eats an apple, increases the score, and grows the snake.\n\nEating the apple is beneficial and safe. The spot below the apple (5, 5) is empty, allowing further movement downwards towards the apple at (6, 1) or turning left\/right. Therefore, moving DOWN is the best option.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#A   SS#\n#    SS#\n#    SA#\n#    H #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (4, 5). The current direction is DOWN.\nThe possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving UP is forbidden as it's the reverse direction.\n1.  Check LEFT: Move to (4, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  Check RIGHT: Move to (4, 6). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n3.  Check DOWN: Move to (5, 5). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n-   Apple locations: A1=(1, 1), A2=(3, 6), A3=(6, 1).\n-   Head location: H=(4, 5).\n-   Nearest apple is A2 at (3, 6).\n\nEvaluating paths:\n-   Move RIGHT: H to (4, 6). Next move UP leads to (3, 6), eating A2. Let's check if this path leads to a trap.\n    1.  Move RIGHT: H(4,6), Dir=RIGHT. Body=(4,5),(3,5),(2,5),(1,5),(1,6). Tail (2,6) removed.\n    2.  Move UP: H(3,6), Eat A2! Dir=UP. Body=(4,6),(4,5),(3,5),(2,5),(1,5),(1,6). Length +1.\n    3.  Check moves from H(3,6): Can move UP to (2,6) (Empty), LEFT to (3,5) (Body), RIGHT to (3,7) (Wall). Moving UP to (2,6) is the only safe option.\n    4.  Move UP: H(2,6), Dir=UP. Body=(3,6),(4,6),(4,5),(3,5),(2,5),(1,5).\n    5.  Check moves from H(2,6): Can move UP to (1,6) (Body), LEFT to (2,5) (Body), RIGHT to (2,7) (Wall). This is a trap! So, moving RIGHT initially is not a good idea.\n\n-   Move LEFT: H to (4, 4). This moves away from A2 but opens up the left side of the board and paths towards A1 and A3. Seems safe but less immediately productive.\n\n-   Move DOWN: H to (5, 5). This moves towards A3. Let's see if we can reach A2 from here.\n    1.  Move DOWN: H(5,5), Dir=DOWN. Body=(4,5),(3,5),(2,5),(1,5),(1,6). Tail (2,6) removed.\n    2.  Move RIGHT: H(5,6), Dir=RIGHT. Body=(5,5),(4,5),(3,5),(2,5),(1,5). Tail (1,6) removed.\n    3.  Move UP: H(4,6), Dir=UP. Body=(5,6),(5,5),(4,5),(3,5),(2,5). Tail (1,5) removed.\n    4.  Move UP: H(3,6), Eat A2! Dir=UP. Body=(4,6),(5,6),(5,5),(4,5),(3,5),(2,5). Length +1.\n    5.  Check moves from H(3,6): Can move UP to (2,6) (Empty), LEFT to (3,5) (Body), RIGHT to (3,7) (Wall). Moving UP to (2,6) is safe.\n    6.  Move UP: H(2,6), Dir=UP. Body=(3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(5,5),(4,5),(3,5).\n    7.  Check moves from H(2,6): Can move UP to (1,6) (Empty), LEFT to (2,5) (Body), RIGHT to (2,7) (Wall). Moving UP to (1,6) is safe.\n    This path (DOWN -> RIGHT -> UP -> UP) safely eats apple A2 in 4 steps and avoids immediate traps.\n\nComparing LEFT and DOWN: DOWN leads to a safe sequence to eat apple A2. LEFT moves away from A2. Therefore, DOWN is the preferred move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#A    S#\n#    SS#\n#    SA#\n#    S #\n#    H #\n# A    #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 12\n\n1.  **Analyze the board:** The snake head 'H' is at (5, 5). The body 'S' occupies (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6). Apples 'A' are at (1, 1), (3, 6), and (6, 1). The current direction is DOWN.\n2.  **Identify possible moves:** The snake is moving DOWN, so it can continue DOWN, or turn LEFT or RIGHT. It cannot turn UP.\n3.  **Evaluate moves:**\n    *   **UP:** Invalid (reversing direction).\n    *   **DOWN:** Move head to (6, 5). This is an empty space. Valid.\n    *   **LEFT:** Move head to (5, 4). This is an empty space. Valid.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Move head to (5, 6). This is a wall '#'. Invalid (collision).\n4.  **Strategize:** There are two valid moves: DOWN and LEFT. The nearest apples are at (6, 1) and (3, 6). The apple at (1, 1) is further away.\n    *   To reach apple (6, 1):\n        *   Moving LEFT to (5, 4) allows subsequent moves DOWN -> LEFT -> LEFT -> LEFT.\n        *   Moving DOWN to (6, 5) allows subsequent moves LEFT -> LEFT -> LEFT -> LEFT.\n        Both paths seem viable and safe for reaching (6, 1).\n    *   To reach apple (3, 6): This apple is right next to the snake's body segment at (2, 6). Reaching it requires maneuvering upwards, which seems complicated and potentially risky given the current body position.\n5.  **Decision:** Both LEFT and DOWN are safe moves that allow progress towards the apple at (6, 1). Moving LEFT keeps the snake slightly higher and potentially offers more maneuvering room later compared to moving DOWN which places the head right next to the bottom wall in the next step. Therefore, LEFT is a reasonable choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#    SS#\n#    SA#\n#    S #\n#   HS #\n# A    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 13\n\nAnalysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 4). The current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot move RIGHT.\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n1.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (5, 3). This square is empty (' '). It is a valid move.\n2.  Move UP: The head moves to (4, 4). This square contains 'S' (snake body). This move leads to a collision. It is not a valid move.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head moves to (6, 4). This square is empty (' '). It is a valid move.\n\nThe valid moves are LEFT and DOWN. We need to choose the better move.\nThere are apples at (1, 1), (3, 6), and (6, 1). The closest apple is A(6, 1).\n- If we move LEFT to (5, 3), the distance to A(6, 1) is |6-5| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3. A possible path is LEFT, LEFT, DOWN (5,3 -> 5,2 -> 5,1 -> 6,1).\n- If we move DOWN to (6, 4), the distance to A(6, 1) is |6-6| + |1-4| = 0 + 3 = 3. A possible path is LEFT, LEFT, LEFT (6,4 -> 6,3 -> 6,2 -> 6,1).\n\nLet's analyze the situation after eating the apple A(6, 1) for both paths:\n- Path starting with LEFT: (5,4)->(5,3)->(5,2)->(5,1)->(6,1)[Apple]. Head at (6,1), direction DOWN. Next possible moves: LEFT (wall), RIGHT (body at 6,2 if moved L,L,D), DOWN (wall). This path seems to lead to a trap. Let's recheck the path L, L, L, D. Start: H(5,4), Body(...2,4), Dir:L. 1.L->H(5,3), S(5,4), Body(...2,5), Dir:L. 2.L->H(5,2), S(5,3), S(5,4), Body(...3,4), Dir:L. 3.L->H(5,1), S(5,2), S(5,3), S(5,4), Body(...3,5), Dir:L. 4.D->H(6,1)[Apple], S(5,1), S(5,2), S(5,3), S(5,4), S(3,5), Dir:D. Next move cannot be UP. LEFT=Wall, RIGHT=Space(6,2), DOWN=Wall. Moving RIGHT to (6,2) is possible. Then LEFT (body), RIGHT(wall), DOWN(wall). This path is also tricky. Re-evaluated path from LEFT: (5,3)->(6,3)->(6,2)->(6,1)[Apple]. 1.L->H(5,3), Dir:L. 2.D->H(6,3), Dir:D. 3.L->H(6,2), Dir:L. 4.L->H(6,1)[Apple], S(6,2), Dir:L. Next move cannot be RIGHT. Possible moves: LEFT(wall), UP(5,1)-safe, DOWN(wall). This path seems better.\n\n- Path starting with DOWN: (5,4)->(6,4)->(6,3)->(6,2)->(6,1)[Apple]. Head at (6,1), direction LEFT. Next possible moves: LEFT (wall), UP (5,1)-safe, DOWN (wall). This path leaves an escape route UP.\n\nComparing the two initial moves:\n- LEFT: Leads to (5, 3). A subsequent safe path to apple (6, 1) exists (e.g., D, L, L), and after eating the apple, moving UP is possible.\n- DOWN: Leads to (6, 4). A subsequent safe path to apple (6, 1) exists (e.g., L, L, L), and after eating the apple, moving UP is possible.\n\nBoth moves allow reaching the nearest apple A(6, 1) without immediate trapping. Let's reconsider the immediate positions.\nMoving DOWN to (6, 4) places the head right above the apple's row.\nMoving LEFT to (5, 3) keeps the snake more towards the center.\nThe path starting DOWN seems slightly more direct towards A(6, 1). Let's choose DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#A     #\n#    S #\n#    SA#\n#    S #\n#   SS #\n# A H  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6, 5).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Check DOWN:** Moving DOWN leads to (7, 5), which is a wall ('#'). This results in a collision and game over.\n2.  **Check LEFT:** Moving LEFT leads to (6, 4). This square is empty and not a wall or part of the snake's body. This move is safe.\n3.  **Check RIGHT:** Moving RIGHT leads to (6, 6). This square is empty and not a wall or part of the snake's body. This move is safe.\n\nNow we need to decide between LEFT and RIGHT. We should aim for the nearest apple while ensuring survival.\nApples are at (1, 1), (3, 6), and (6, 1).\n\n-   If we move LEFT to (6, 4):\n    -   The closest apple is at (6, 1) (distance 3). The path LEFT, LEFT, LEFT seems clear and safe, reaching the apple in 3 moves.\n    -   The apple at (3, 6) is distance 5 away.\n    -   The apple at (1, 1) is distance 8 away.\n-   If we move RIGHT to (6, 6):\n    -   The closest apple is at (3, 6) (distance 3). The path UP, UP, UP seems clear and safe, reaching the apple in 3 moves (RIGHT->UP->UP->UP is 4 moves total).\n    -   The apple at (6, 1) is distance 5 away.\n    -   The apple at (1, 1) is distance 10 away.\n\nMoving LEFT allows reaching the apple at (6, 1) in 3 subsequent moves (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT). Total 4 moves from current state.\nMoving RIGHT allows reaching the apple at (3, 6) in 3 subsequent moves (UP, UP, UP). Total 4 moves from current state.\n\nLet's re-examine the path after RIGHT:\nCurrent: (6, 5), Dir: DOWN\n1. RIGHT: Head at (6, 6). Dir: RIGHT. State:\n########\n#A     #\n#    S #\n#    SA#\n#    S #\n#   SS #\n# A SH #\n########\n2. UP: Head at (5, 6). Dir: UP.

LEFT: Head at (6, 4). Dir: LEFT. State:\n########\n#A     #\n#    S #\n#    SA#\n#    S #\n#   SS #\n# A HS #\n########\n2. LEFT: Head at (6, 3). Dir: LEFT.

Let's consider the position after eating the apple.\n- After path LEFT: Head at (6, 1), Direction LEFT. Snake is long and horizontal along row 6. Might be constrained. Possible moves: UP, DOWN. DOWN hits wall. Must go UP.\n- After path RIGHT: Head at (3, 6), Direction UP. Snake is mostly vertical along col 6 and 5. Possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, UP. LEFT is safe. RIGHT hits wall. UP is safe. Seems less constrained.\n\nHowever, the primary goal is usually survival and finding the *nearest* apple. If we just consider the next move, both LEFT and RIGHT are safe. LEFT moves towards the apple at (6, 1) (distance 3 from (6,4)). RIGHT moves towards the apple at (3, 6) (distance 3 from (6,6)).\n\nLet's think about space. Moving LEFT keeps the snake in the lower part of the board. Moving RIGHT also keeps it low initially but forces it UP towards the middle\/top. Moving towards (6, 1) via LEFT keeps the snake lower down and seems slightly safer in the short term by avoiding immediate forced moves.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is a reasonable choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#    SA#\n#    S #\n#   SS #\n# AHS  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\n- The snake's head is at row 6, column 2 ('H').\n- The current direction is LEFT.\n- The snake cannot reverse direction, so moving RIGHT is not allowed.\n- Moving DOWN would lead to a collision with the wall at row 7, column 2.\n- Moving UP would move the head to row 5, column 2, which is empty and safe.\n- Moving LEFT would move the head to row 6, column 1, which contains an apple ('A'). This is a safe move and allows the snake to eat the apple and grow.\n\nEating the apple is the primary objective when safe. Moving LEFT achieves this.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#A     #\n#    SA#\n#    S #\n#   SS #\n# HSS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1.  **LEFT**: The head 'H' is at (6, 1). Moving LEFT would hit the wall '#' at (6, 0). This leads to game over.\n2.  **RIGHT**: The current direction is LEFT. Moving RIGHT is reversing direction, which is not allowed. Even if it were allowed, moving RIGHT to (6, 2) would hit the snake body 'S'. This leads to game over.\n3.  **UP**: Moving UP would move the head to (5, 1). This square is empty ' '. This is a valid move.\n4.  **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would move the head to (7, 1). This square is a wall '#'. This leads to game over.\n\nThe only valid and non-fatal move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#    S #\n# H SS #\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 17\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (5, 2). The current direction is UP.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. The snake cannot move DOWN as it's the reverse of UP.\n1.  Check UP: Moving to (4, 2). This square is empty. It's a valid move.\n2.  Check LEFT: Moving to (5, 1). This square is empty. It's a valid move.\n3.  Check RIGHT: Moving to (5, 3). This square is occupied by the snake body 'S'. This is an invalid move (collision).\n\nThe valid moves are UP and LEFT.\nLet's evaluate the consequences:\n- Move UP: The head moves to (4, 2). This position is safe and closer to the apples at (1, 1) and (2, 1). From (4, 2), the snake can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. This provides flexibility.\n- Move LEFT: The head moves to (5, 1). This position is safe, but very close to the left wall. From (5, 1), the only possible next move (without hitting the wall or reversing) is UP to (4, 1). This is more restrictive.\n\nMoving UP keeps the snake in a more open area and provides more options for subsequent moves, while still progressing towards the apples in the upper-left corner. Therefore, UP is the better move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n# H    #\n# S SS #\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 18\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 2) and is currently moving UP.\nPossible next moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse direction.\n\n1.  **UP**: The head would move to (3, 2). This square is empty and not a wall. This move is safe and moves towards the apples at (1, 1) and (2, 1).\n2.  **LEFT**: The head would move to (4, 1). This square is empty and not a wall. This move is safe and moves towards the apples at (1, 1) and (2, 1). However, the next move LEFT would hit the wall.\n3.  **RIGHT**: The head would move to (4, 3). This square is empty and not a wall. This move is safe but moves away from the closest apples. The next move RIGHT would hit the snake's body at (4,4) (which would be (5,4) after the move).\n\nContinuing UP seems like the most reasonable strategy to approach the nearby apples while maintaining flexibility for future moves.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#A     #\n# H   A#\n# S    #\n# S S  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 19\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head is at (3, 2).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

Moving DOWN to (4, 3) positions the snake closer to the apples while keeping options open (can then move LEFT to (4, 2) or DOWN to (5, 3)). Moving LEFT to (3, 2) gets closer but might restrict movement near the left wall later.

The current direction is LEFT.\n\n1.  **Attempt to move UP**: The head would move to (4, 1). Looking at the board, the cell at (4, 1) is empty (' '). This is a valid move. The new direction would be UP.\n2.  **Attempt to move DOWN**: The head would move to (6, 1). Looking at the board, the cell at (6, 1) contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move. The snake would eat the apple, increase its score and length. The new direction would be DOWN.\n3.  **Attempt to move LEFT**: The head would move to (5, 0). Looking at the board, the cell at (5, 0) is a wall ('#'). This is an invalid move (collision).\n4.  **Attempt to move RIGHT**: The current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse its direction, so moving RIGHT is invalid.\n\nWe have two valid moves: UP and DOWN. Let's analyze the consequences:\n\n*   **If we move DOWN:**\n    *   The snake eats the apple at (6, 1). Head is at (6, 1). Direction is DOWN. Length increases.\n    *   From (6, 1), the only possible move is RIGHT to (6, 2) (UP hits new body segment at (5,1), DOWN\/LEFT hit walls).\n    *   From (6, 2) (direction RIGHT), the only possible move is RIGHT to (6, 3) (UP\/LEFT hit body, DOWN hits wall).\n    *   From (6, 3) (direction RIGHT), the only possible move is UP to (5, 3) (DOWN hits wall, LEFT\/RIGHT hit body).\n    *   From (5, 3) (direction UP), the only possible move is RIGHT to (5, 4) (UP\/DOWN\/LEFT hit body).\n    *   From (5, 4) (direction RIGHT), all moves are blocked: UP (4,4)='S', DOWN (6,4)='S', LEFT (5,3)='S' (new body), RIGHT (5,5)='S'. This is a dead end.\n    *   Therefore, moving DOWN leads to a trap shortly after eating the apple.\n\n*   **If we move UP:**\n    *   The snake moves to (4, 1). Head is at (4, 1). Direction is UP. Length stays the same (tail segment removed).\n    *   From (4, 1) (direction UP), the only valid move is UP to (3, 1) (LEFT hits wall, RIGHT hits body at (4,2), DOWN is invalid reverse).\n    *   From (3, 1) (direction UP), the only valid move is UP to (2, 1) (LEFT hits wall, RIGHT hits body at (3,2), DOWN is invalid reverse).\n    *   From (2, 1) (direction UP), possible moves are UP to (1, 1) (Apple 'A') or RIGHT to (2, 2) (' '). Moving UP allows eating an apple.\n    *   This path seems safer and leads towards an apple without immediate traps.\n\nComparing the two valid options, moving UP is the safer choice as moving DOWN leads to a guaranteed dead end soon after.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#A    A#\n#    S #\n#  SSSS#\n# HSSSS#\n# SS SS#\n# A  SS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 1).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN because that would be reversing its direction.\nLet's check the possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, UP.\n\n1.

This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n- Move LEFT: The head moves to (3, 1). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n- Move RIGHT: The head moves to (3, 3). This square contains the snake's body ('S'). This move leads to a collision and is invalid.\n\nWe need to choose between UP and LEFT.\n- Choosing UP moves the head to (2, 2). This keeps the snake in the open space and provides access to the apples in the top row. From (2, 2), the snake can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n- Choosing LEFT moves the head to (3, 1). This moves closer to the apple at (1, 1) and (6, 1). From (3, 1), the snake can only move UP (to 2, 1). Moving LEFT hits the wall ('#'), and moving DOWN hits the snake's body ('S').

The current direction is UP. The snake cannot move DOWN.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  Move UP: The head moves to (1, 2). This square is empty. This move is safe. It positions the snake one step away (LEFT) from the apple at (1, 1).\n2.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (2, 1). This square is empty. This move is safe. It positions the snake one step away (UP) from the apple at (1, 1).\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (2, 3). This square is empty. This move is safe. It moves the snake away from the nearest apples.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe moves that position the snake to eat the apple at (1, 1) in the following turn. Moving UP maintains the current general direction and aligns the snake along the top row to potentially go for the apple at (1, 6) later.

Moving UP would move the head to (0, 2), which is a wall (#). This leads to a collision and game over.\n2.  **DOWN**: The current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction directly from UP to DOWN. This move is invalid.\n3.  **LEFT**: The snake's head is at (1, 2). Moving LEFT would move the head to (1, 1), which contains an apple (A). If the snake moves LEFT, it eats the apple and grows. The new head will be at (1, 1), the old head position (1, 2) becomes part of the body, and the tail end (6, 5) remains because the snake grew. The new body configuration would be H at (1,1), S at (1,2), S at (2,1), S at (3,1)...S at (6,5). The new direction would be LEFT. From the new head position (1, 1), the possible moves are: UP (wall), DOWN (to (2,1), which is occupied by 'S'), LEFT (wall), RIGHT (to (1,2), which is occupied by 'S'). All possible moves lead to a collision. Therefore, moving LEFT is fatal on the next step.\n4.  **RIGHT**: The snake's head is at (1, 2). Moving RIGHT would move the head to (1, 3), which is an empty space (' '). This move is safe as it avoids walls and the snake's body. The snake does not eat an apple, so its tail segment at (6, 5) will disappear. The new head will be at (1, 3) and the new direction will be RIGHT. From (1, 3), the snake can safely move DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nComparing LEFT and RIGHT: Moving LEFT leads to eating an apple but results in an unavoidable collision immediately after. Moving RIGHT is safe and allows the game to continue. Thus, the optimal move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#ASH  A#\n# S    #\n# SSS  #\n# SSSS #\n# SS SS#\n# A  SS#\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 46\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (1, 3).

This is a valid move.\n\nNow evaluate the valid moves (DOWN, RIGHT):\n- **Moving DOWN:** The head moves to (2, 3). The space looks relatively open initially, but the snake body occupies a large area below rows 2 and 3 (positions (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2) to (4,5), (5,2), (5,3), (5,5), (5,6), (6,5), (6,6)). Moving down might lead into this denser area. From (2, 3), the only immediate non-collision move would be RIGHT to (2, 4), as LEFT hits the new body segment at (1, 3) and DOWN hits the body segment at (3, 3).\n- **Moving RIGHT:** The head moves to (1, 4). This keeps the snake in the upper part of the board. There is an apple nearby at (1, 6). From (1, 4), the snake can move DOWN to (2, 4) or RIGHT to (1, 5). Moving RIGHT again to (1, 5) and then RIGHT to (1, 6) allows the snake to eat the apple.\n\nComparing the two options, moving RIGHT keeps the snake in a less congested area and provides a clear path towards the apple at (1, 6). Moving DOWN leads into a tighter spot with fewer immediate options.

The snake will eat the apple, increase its score and length, and continue moving RIGHT.\n\nComparing valid moves:\n- Moving DOWN is safe but does not yield an immediate score increase.\n- Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, increasing the score. After eating the apple at (1, 6), the only possible move will be DOWN (to 2, 6) because RIGHT hits a wall, LEFT is reversing the new direction (RIGHT), and UP hits the new body segment created at (1, 5).

Since there's a safe move after eating the apple, moving DOWN is the best option.\n\nTherefore, the only viable move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#ASSSSS#\n# S  SS#\n# SS S #\n# SS S #\n# SSAH #\n# A    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 54\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 6) (row 5, column 6, using 0-based indexing for top-left corner).\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP because it's the reverse of DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n1.  **Check move LEFT:**\n    *   The head would move to (5, 5).\n    *   The content of cell (5, 5) is ' ' (empty space).\n    *   This move is valid and does not cause a collision.\n\n2.  **Check move RIGHT:**\n    *   The head would move to (5, 7).\n    *   The content of cell (5, 7) is '#' (wall).\n    *   This move causes a collision with the wall. Invalid move.\n\n3.  **Check move DOWN:**\n    *   The head would move to (6, 6).\n    *   The content of cell (6, 6) is ' ' (empty space).\n    *   This move is valid and does not cause a collision.\n\nWe have two valid moves: LEFT and DOWN.\nLet's consider the position of the apples 'A': (1, 1), (5, 4), and (6, 1).\n*   If we move LEFT to (5, 5), the apple at (5, 4) becomes adjacent to the head. The next move could potentially be LEFT again to eat this apple.\n*   If we move DOWN to (6, 6), we move further away from the apple at (5, 4) but slightly closer to the apple at (6, 1). Getting to (6, 1) would require subsequent LEFT turns.\n\nMoving towards the closest apple at (5, 4) is a good strategy. Moving LEFT facilitates this.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#ASSSSS#\n# S ASS#\n# SS S #\n# SS S #\n# SSHS #\n# A    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at coordinates (6, 5) (row 6, column 5).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe possible next moves are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. The snake cannot move RIGHT because it's the opposite of LEFT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (5, 5). This square contains 'S' (snake body). This move results in a collision.\n2.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (6, 4). This square contains 'S' (snake body). This move results in a collision.\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (7, 5). This square is empty (' '). This move is safe.\n\nThe only move that does not result in an immediate collision is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#ASSSSS#\n# S ASS#\n# S  S #\n# SS S #\n# SSSS #\n# A H  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 56\n\nMy analysis:\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6, 3).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot move UP because its own body 'S' is at (5, 3).\nThe snake cannot move DOWN because there is a wall '#' at (7, 3).\nThe possible moves are LEFT to (6, 2) or RIGHT to (6, 4). Both squares are empty.\n\nLet's analyze the path if I choose LEFT:\n1.  Move LEFT to (6, 2). Direction is now LEFT. Position is safe.\n2.  From (6, 2), the only valid move is LEFT to (6, 1), which contains an apple 'A'.\n3.  Move LEFT to (6, 1). Eat the apple. Snake grows. Direction is LEFT. Position is safe.\n4.  From (6, 1), the only valid move is UP to (5, 1) (LEFT and DOWN are walls, RIGHT is body 'S').\n5.  Move UP to (5, 1). Direction is UP. Position is safe.\n6.  Following this path UP leads to (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). All seem safe initially.\n7.  Move UP to (2, 1). Position is safe.\n8.  From (2, 1), the only valid move is UP to (1, 1), which contains an apple 'A'.\n9.  Move UP to (1, 1). Eat the apple. Snake grows. Direction is UP. Position is safe.\n10. From (1, 1), all surrounding squares are either walls ('#') or the snake's body ('S'). This path leads to a dead end after eating 2 apples.\n\nLet's analyze the path if I choose RIGHT:\n1.  Move RIGHT to (6, 4). Direction is RIGHT. Position is safe.\n2.  From (6, 4), the only valid move is RIGHT to (6, 5) (UP and LEFT are body 'S', DOWN is wall '#').\n3.  Move RIGHT to (6, 5). Direction is RIGHT. Position is safe.\n4.  From (6, 5), the only valid move is RIGHT to (6, 6) (UP and LEFT are body 'S', DOWN is wall '#').\n5.  Move RIGHT to (6, 6). Direction is RIGHT. Position is safe.\n6.  From (6, 6), the only valid move is UP to (5, 6) (LEFT and DOWN are body 'S', RIGHT is wall '#'. Note: (5,6) is empty according to the board).\n7.  Move UP to (5, 6). Direction is UP. Position is safe.\n8.  Following this path UP leads to (4,6), (3,6).\n9.  Move UP to (3, 6). Position is safe.\n10. From (3, 6), all surrounding squares are either walls ('#') or the snake's body ('S'). This path leads to a dead end without eating any more apples.\n\nComparing the two paths, both lead to unavoidable game over situations shortly. However, the goal is to eat as many apples as possible. The path starting with LEFT allows the snake to eat 2 more apples before the game ends, while the path starting with RIGHT allows eating 0 more apples. Therefore, LEFT is the better choice according to the game's objective.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#ASSSSS#\n# S ASS#\n# S  S #\n# S  S #\n# SSSS #\n# AHS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 57\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6, 2).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nPossible moves:\n1.

The snake cannot reverse direction directly, so moving RIGHT is not allowed in the next step. Even if it were allowed, moving RIGHT would take the head to (6, 2), which is occupied by the snake's body (S), leading to collision.\n3.  **UP:** Moving UP would take the head to (5, 1).

The current direction is UP. The snake is at position (4, 3). The possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving DOWN is not allowed as it's the reverse of UP.\n\n1.  **Move UP**: The snake's head moves to (3, 3). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid and safe move. It positions the snake closer to the apple at (3, 2) and the apple at (2, 1).\n2.  **Move LEFT**: The snake's head moves to (4, 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid and safe move. It positions the snake closer to the apple at (3, 2).\n3.  **Move RIGHT**: The snake's head moves to (4, 4). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid and safe move. It positions the snake closer to the apple at (6, 4) but further from the other two apples.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT position the snake to potentially eat the apple at (3, 2) in the next step. Moving UP positions the head at (3, 3), one step away from the apple at (3, 2) and also relatively close to the apple at (2, 1). Moving LEFT positions the head at (4, 2), also one step away from the apple at (3, 2).\n\nChoosing UP seems like a reasonable strategy as it moves towards the cluster of two apples in the upper-left part of the board.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# AH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at row 3, column 4.\nThe current direction is UP.\nPossible next moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. DOWN is not allowed as it reverses the current direction.\n1.  Move UP: The head moves to (2, 4). This is an empty space.\n2.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (3, 3). This is an empty space. There is an apple nearby at (3, 2).\n3.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (3, 5). This is an empty space.\n\nTo maximize the chance of eating an apple soon, moving LEFT brings the snake closer to the apple at (3, 2). Moving UP moves away from the closest apple. Moving RIGHT also moves away. Therefore, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# HS   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\nThe snake head is at (3, 2) and the body is at (3, 3).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (reversing direction).\nPossible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head moves to (3, 1). This position is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move. The snake will be H(3, 1), S(3, 2). This positions the snake closer to the apple at (2, 1).\n2.  **Move UP:** The head moves to (2, 2). This position is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move. The snake will be H(2, 2), S(3, 2). This also positions the snake closer to the apple at (2, 1).\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head moves to (4, 2). This position is empty and not a wall. This is a valid move. The snake will be H(4, 2), S(3, 2). This moves the snake away from the nearest apple but towards the apples at the bottom.\n\nTo eat the nearest apple at (2, 1), both LEFT and UP are good initial moves.\nLet's consider the next step after each move:\n- If move LEFT: Snake is H(3, 1), S(3, 2). Next move could be UP to (2, 1) to eat the apple.\n- If move UP: Snake is H(2, 2), S(3, 2). Next move could be LEFT to (2, 1) to eat the apple.\n\nBoth paths lead to the apple. Let's evaluate safety after eating the apple.\n- After LEFT then UP: Snake is H(2, 1), S(3, 1), S(3, 2). The head is at the wall. Must turn RIGHT to (2, 2) or DOWN to (3, 1) (collision). So must turn RIGHT. This seems safe.\n- After UP then LEFT: Snake is H(2, 1), S(2, 2), S(3, 2). The head is at the wall. Must turn RIGHT to (2, 2) (collision) or DOWN to (3, 1). Must turn DOWN. This seems safe too, but potentially leads towards the body faster.\n\nMoving LEFT first seems slightly better as the turn required after eating the apple moves away from the body.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#HS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 1) and its body is at (3, 2).\nThe current direction is LEFT.\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n- Moving LEFT to (3, 0) hits a wall '#'. Game Over.\n- Moving UP to (2, 1) eats an apple 'A'. Safe and beneficial.\n- Moving DOWN to (4, 1) moves to an empty space ' '. Safe but doesn't eat an apple.\n\nThe best move is to eat the apple directly above the head.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#H     #\n#SS    #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 1). The body segments are at (3, 1) and (3, 2).\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  Check UP: Move head to (1, 1). This square is empty ' '. Valid move.\n2.  Check LEFT: Move head to (2, 0). This square is a wall '#'. Invalid move (collision).\n3.  Check RIGHT: Move head to (2, 2). This square is empty ' '. Valid move.\n\nWe have two valid moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nLet's evaluate them:\n- Move UP: Head moves to (1, 1). The snake becomes H(1,1), S(2,1), S(3,1). No apple eaten. The snake moves towards the top wall.\n- Move RIGHT: Head moves to (2, 2). The snake becomes H(2,2), S(2,1), S(3,1). No apple eaten. The snake moves towards the center.\n\nComparing the two moves:\n- Both are safe in the short term.\n- Moving RIGHT keeps the snake more centrally located, offering potentially more maneuvering space and access routes to the apples at (4, 5), (6, 1), and (6, 4). Moving UP places the snake closer to the top wall, potentially restricting future movement, and moves it away from all apples.\n- Moving RIGHT allows for subsequent moves UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since the new direction is RIGHT). Moving UP allows for subsequent moves UP or RIGHT (since the new direction is UP). However, moving UP again from (1,1) would hit the wall. So, only RIGHT would be possible after moving UP.\n\nMoving RIGHT provides more flexibility and better positioning relative to the apples.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#      #\n#SH    #\n#S     #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 3), and its body segments are at (2, 2) and (3, 2). The current direction is RIGHT.\nThe possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT is not allowed as it reverses the current direction.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The head would move to (1, 3). This is an empty space and is safe (no collision with walls or self).\n2.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (3, 3). This is an empty space and is safe.\n3.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (2, 4). This is an empty space and is safe.\n\nThe goal is to eat apples located at (4, 5), (6, 1), and (6, 4).\n- Moving RIGHT to (2, 4) keeps the snake moving towards the apple at (4, 5). A possible path is R, R, D, D.\n- Moving DOWN to (3, 3) also moves towards the apple at (4, 5). A possible path is D, R, R, D.\n- Moving UP to (1, 3) moves away from all apples.\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN are safe moves that position the snake to potentially eat the apple at (4, 5) soon. Continuing in the current direction (RIGHT) is a reasonable strategy when safe and doesn't move away from targets. Moving RIGHT maintains horizontal alignment temporarily, potentially offering flexibility.\n\nLet's choose to continue RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#SSH   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nBased on the current board state and rules:\n1. The snake head is at (2, 4).\n2. The snake body is at (2, 3) and (2, 2).\n3. The current direction is RIGHT.\n4. The snake cannot move LEFT (reverse direction).\n5. Possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n   - Moving UP leads to (1, 4), an empty space.\n   - Moving DOWN leads to (3, 4), an empty space.\n   - Moving RIGHT leads to (2, 5), an empty space.\n6. Apples are located at (4, 5), (6, 1), and (6, 4).\n7. The goal is to eat apples and survive. Moving DOWN positions the snake closer to the lower part of the board where all three apples are located. Moving RIGHT also moves towards the apple at (4,5) but keeps the snake higher up. Moving UP moves away from all apples.\n8. Moving DOWN to (3, 4) seems like a good strategic move to approach the apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#      #\n# SS   #\n#  H   #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 3) and its body segments are at (2, 3) and (2, 2). The current direction is DOWN. The apples are located at (4, 5), (6, 1), and (6, 4).\n\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN (cannot move UP because it's the reverse of DOWN).\n\n1.  **Move LEFT:** The head would move to (3, 2). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid and safe move. It moves towards the apple at (6, 1).\n2.  **Move RIGHT:** The head would move to (3, 4). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid and safe move. It moves towards the apples at (4, 5) and (6, 4).\n3.  **Move DOWN:** The head would move to (4, 3). This square is empty and not a wall. This is a valid and safe move. It moves towards all three apples, particularly the cluster at the bottom and the apple at (4, 5).\n\nComparing the options:\n- The closest apple is at (4, 5).\n- Moving RIGHT (to 3, 4) gets closer to (4, 5). A subsequent DOWN (to 4, 4) and RIGHT (to 4, 5) would eat the apple.\n- Moving DOWN (to 4, 3) also gets closer to (4, 5). A subsequent RIGHT (to 4, 4) and RIGHT (to 4, 5) would eat the apple.\n- Moving LEFT (to 3, 2) moves away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN are good moves towards the nearest apple. Moving DOWN continues the current direction and positions the snake well to access all three apples. It keeps the snake slightly more central than moving RIGHT immediately.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is a good strategy.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 9\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 3). The current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN (cannot move UP as it's the reverse of DOWN).\n1.  Move LEFT: Head moves to (4, 2). This is an empty space, not a wall or body part. Valid.\n2.  Move RIGHT: Head moves to (4, 4). This is an empty space, not a wall or body part. Valid.\n3.  Move DOWN: Head moves to (5, 3). This is an empty space, not a wall or body part. Valid.\n\nLet's evaluate the moves:\n-   LEFT: Moves the head to (4, 2). Safe. Does not eat an apple.\n-   RIGHT: Moves the head to (4, 4). Safe. Does not eat an apple immediately, but positions the snake next to the apple at (4, 5) for the following move.\n-   DOWN: Moves the head to (5, 3). Safe. Does not eat an apple. Moves towards the apples in the lower part of the board.\n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to potentially eat the apple at (4, 5) in the next step by moving RIGHT again. This is a good short-term strategy to increase the score and length. Let's check the safety of the subsequent move: If the snake moves RIGHT to (4, 4), its body will be at (4, 3) and (3, 3). Moving RIGHT again to (4, 5) will eat the apple, the head will be at (4, 5), and the body will be at (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3). This path is safe.\n\nMoving RIGHT seems the most advantageous move currently.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  SHA #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake head is at (4, 3). The current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (cannot move LEFT as it's the reverse direction).\n\n1.  **Move UP:** Head moves to (3, 3). This is an empty space ' '.

Valid move.\n\nLet's analyze the positions relative to apples:\n- Apple 1 is at (4, 5).\n- Apple 2 is at (6, 1).\n- Apple 3 is at (6, 4).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 4) places the snake head one step away from Apple 1 at (4, 5). The next move (RIGHT again) would eat the apple.\nMoving DOWN to (5, 3) moves towards Apple 3 at (6, 4).\nMoving UP to (3, 3) moves away from the closest apple.\n\nMoving RIGHT seems the most immediately beneficial move as it sets up eating an apple in the following turn.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  SSH #\n#   A  #\n#A  A  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nBased on the current board state, the snake head is at (4, 5) and moving RIGHT. The body segments are at (4, 4), (4, 3), and (3, 3). There are apples at (5, 4), (6, 1), and (6, 4).\n\nPossible moves:\n1.  **RIGHT:** Move to (4, 6). This is a safe empty square.\n2.  **UP:** Move to (3, 5). This is a safe empty square.\n3.  **DOWN:** Move to (5, 5). This is a safe empty square.\n4.  **LEFT:** Invalid move (reverse direction).\n\nEvaluating the valid moves:\n-   Moving RIGHT takes the snake further away from the cluster of apples at the bottom.\n-   Moving UP also moves away from the closest apples.\n-   Moving DOWN positions the snake at (5, 5). From here, a LEFT turn in the next step would lead to eating the apple at (5, 4). After eating that apple, another DOWN turn would lead to eating the apple at (6, 4). This path seems efficient for collecting nearby apples quickly.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is the most strategic move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SSS #\n#   AH #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nMove analysis:\nThe snake's head is at (5, 5). The current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot move UP.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n1.  Move LEFT: The head moves to (5, 4). This square contains an apple ('A'). The snake eats the apple, grows longer, and the score increases. This move is valid as (5, 4) is not a wall or part of the snake's body.\n2.  Move RIGHT: The head moves to (5, 6). This square is empty. This move is valid.\n3.  Move DOWN: The head moves to (6, 5). This square is empty. This move is valid.\n\nChoosing the best move:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is the primary goal. After moving LEFT and eating the apple, the head will be at (5, 4), the direction will be LEFT, and the snake will be longer. From (5, 4), the snake can move DOWN (to eat another apple at (6, 4)) or LEFT (to (5, 3)). Moving LEFT is safe and productive.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  SSS #\n#   HS #\n#A  A  #\n########\n```\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#  SSS #\n#   SS #\n#A  H  #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 14\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6, 4) (row, column, 0-indexed from the top-left corner inside the walls).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move UP.\nPossible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN.\n\n1.  **Move DOWN:** The snake head would move to (7, 4).

This move is valid and safe. However, it moves away from the closest apple at (6, 1).\n\nComparing LEFT and RIGHT, moving LEFT is strategically better as it moves towards the nearest apple at (6, 1) while remaining safe. Moving RIGHT is safe but less efficient for eating the nearby apple.

This is a safe move but does not eat an apple.\n3.  Move UP: The head would move to (3, 1), which contains an apple 'A'. This is a safe move, eats an apple, increases the score, and grows the snake.\n\nEating an apple is desirable. Moving UP achieves this safely. Therefore, UP is the best move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#H   A #\n#S     #\n#SA S  #\n#SSSS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 20\n\nAnalyzing the possible moves:\n1.  **UP**: The snake head is at (row 3, col 1). Moving UP leads to (row 2, col 1). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move and moves towards the apple at (row 2, col 3).\n2.  **LEFT**: Moving LEFT leads to (row 3, col 0). This square is a wall ('#'). This is an invalid move (collision).\n3.  **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT leads to (row 3, col 2). This square is empty (' '). This is a valid move and moves towards the apples at (row 2, col 3) and (row 3, col 5).\n4.  **DOWN**: The current direction is UP, so moving DOWN is not allowed (cannot reverse direction).\n\nComparing valid moves UP and RIGHT:\n- Moving UP to (2, 1) places the snake closer to the apple at (2, 3). From (2, 1), the next moves could be UP or RIGHT. Going RIGHT -> RIGHT would reach the apple.\n- Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) places the snake such that it can then move UP towards the apple at (2, 3) or continue RIGHT towards the apple at (3, 5).\n\nBoth moves are safe. Moving UP is a direct approach towards the nearest apple at (2, 3).\n\nLet's choose UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#      #\n#H  A  #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#SA    #\n#SSSS  #\n########\n```\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head is at (2, 1). The snake cannot move DOWN (reverse direction) or LEFT (wall).\nPossible moves are UP and RIGHT.\n- Moving UP: The head would move to (1, 1). This is a valid empty space.\n- Moving RIGHT: The head would move to (2, 2). This is a valid empty space.\n\nLet's evaluate the moves strategically:\n- Moving UP moves the snake away from all apples. The head would be at (1, 1), and the only subsequent move would be RIGHT to (1, 2).\n- Moving RIGHT moves the snake to (2, 2). This position allows further moves UP (1, 2), DOWN (3, 2), or RIGHT (2, 3). Moving RIGHT again towards (2, 3) and then (2, 4) would allow the snake to eat the apple at (2, 4).\n\nMoving RIGHT is strategically better as it progresses towards an apple while maintaining multiple options for future movement.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","```\n########\n#      #\n#SH A  #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#SA    #\n#SSS   #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 22\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at (2, 3).

This is an empty space and a valid move.\n\nLet's evaluate the moves:\n-   Moving UP to (1, 3) moves away from the closest apples.\n-   Moving DOWN to (3, 3) moves closer to the apple at (5, 3) and keeps the path open to the apple at (3, 5).\n-   Moving RIGHT to (2, 4) positions the snake to eat the apple at (2, 5) in the next move. After eating the apple at (2, 5), the snake could potentially move DOWN to eat the apple at (3, 5).\n\nMoving RIGHT seems the most advantageous as it leads directly to eating an apple in the next step.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#SSHA  #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#SA    #\n#SS    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 4).

This square contains an apple ('A'). Valid move.\n\nChoosing the best move:\n- Moving UP moves away from the apples.\n- Moving DOWN moves towards the apple at (3, 5) but misses the immediate apple at (2, 5).\n- Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple at (2, 5) immediately, increasing the score and length. This is the primary objective. After moving RIGHT, the head will be at (2, 5), and the new direction will be RIGHT. Possible next moves would be UP (1, 5), DOWN (3, 5 - another apple), or RIGHT (2, 6).

The current direction is RIGHT.\nPossible moves:\n1.  UP: Move to (2, 6). This contains an apple 'A'. If the snake moves UP, it eats the apple. The head becomes (2, 6). The next state's head will be at (2, 6) and the body part will be at (3, 6). From (2, 6), the snake cannot move UP (wall), LEFT (body at 2, 5), or RIGHT (wall). The snake will be trapped and lose.\n2.  DOWN: Move to (4, 6). This is an empty square. This move is safe. The head becomes (4, 6). From (4, 6), the snake can continue moving DOWN or turn LEFT.\n3.  LEFT: Cannot move LEFT as the current direction is RIGHT (cannot reverse).\n4.  RIGHT: Move to (3, 7). This is a wall '#'. This move leads to game over.\n\nComparing the valid moves UP and DOWN: Moving UP leads to eating an apple but immediate trapping. Moving DOWN is safe and allows the game to continue. Survival is the priority. Therefore, DOWN is the better move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","```\n########\n#A     #\n#SSSSA #\n#S  SS #\n#S   H #\n#SA    #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 27\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 5). The current direction is DOWN.\nThe valid moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN. Moving UP is forbidden because it's the reverse of DOWN.\n\n1.  **Check move RIGHT:** The position (4, 6) is a wall '#'. This move leads to a collision and game over.\n2.  **Check move DOWN:** The position (5, 5) is empty ' '. This is a safe move. The new head position would be (5, 5). The closest apple is at (5, 3). Moving DOWN takes the snake further from this apple.\n3.  **Check move LEFT:** The position (4, 4) is empty ' '. This is a safe move. The new head position would be (4, 4). From (4, 4), the snake could potentially move DOWN towards the apple at (5, 3).\n\nComparing the safe moves: Moving LEFT allows the snake to potentially move towards the nearest apple at (5, 3) in the subsequent steps (by moving DOWN next). Moving DOWN takes the snake away from the nearest apple and towards the bottom edge with fewer subsequent options. Therefore, moving LEFT is the better strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#SSSSA #\n#S  SS #\n#S  HS #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 28\n\nRules Recap:\n- Snake (H=Head, S=Body) moves on an 8x8 board.\n- Walls (#) surround the board.\n- Apples (A) increase score and snake length when eaten.\n- Current direction: LEFT. Snake moves one step per epoch.\n- Cannot reverse direction (Cannot go RIGHT now).\n- Collision with walls or self ends the game.\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  **Identify Snake Head:** The head 'H' is at position (4, 4) (Row 4, Column 4, 0-indexed from top-left).\n2.  **Identify Current Direction:** The snake is moving LEFT.\n3.  **Identify Possible Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT:** Move to (4, 3). This square is empty. Valid.\n    *   **UP:** Move to (3, 4). This square contains 'S' (snake body). Collision. Invalid.\n    *   **DOWN:** Move to (5, 4). This square is empty. Valid.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Cannot move RIGHT as the current direction is LEFT (reversing direction is not allowed). Invalid.\n4.  **Evaluate Valid Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT (to 4, 3):** This move is safe. It positions the snake closer to the apple at (5, 1). A potential path is LEFT -> DOWN -> LEFT -> LEFT to reach the apple. This path seems safe and doesn't immediately trap the snake after eating.\n    *   **DOWN (to 5, 4):** This move is also safe. It moves the snake towards the bottom edge. From (5, 4), the snake could potentially target the apple at (5, 1) (path: DOWN -> LEFT -> LEFT -> LEFT) or the apple at (2, 6) (path: DOWN -> RIGHT -> RIGHT -> UP -> UP -> UP). However, analysis shows the path to (2, 6) leads to the snake trapping itself immediately after eating. The path to (5, 1) is longer starting with DOWN than starting with LEFT.\n\n5.  **Decision:** Moving LEFT is a safe move that allows progress towards the nearest reachable apple at (5, 1) via a seemingly safe path. Moving DOWN is also safe initially but doesn't offer as direct a route to an apple without potential complications. Therefore, moving LEFT seems the better strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","```\n########\n#A     #\n#SSSSA #\n#S  SS #\n#  HSS #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nSnake Head: (4, 3)\nSnake Body: (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1)\nApples: (1, 1), (2, 6), (5, 1)\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake head is at position (4, 3).\nThe snake cannot move RIGHT (reverse direction).\nPossible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n1.  **Move UP:**\n    - New head position: (3, 3).\n    - This square is empty.\n    - Valid move. This moves away from the nearest apple at (5, 1).\n\n2.  **Move DOWN:**\n    - New head position: (5, 3).\n    - This square is empty.\n    - Valid move. This moves towards the apple at (5, 1).\n\n3.  **Move LEFT:**\n    - New head position: (4, 2).\n    - This square is empty.\n    - Valid move. This also moves towards the apple at (5, 1).\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are viable moves towards the nearest apple at (5, 1). Let's analyze the path after each move to get the apple at (5, 1).\n\n- If move DOWN: Head at (5, 3), direction DOWN. Next possible moves are LEFT or DOWN. Moving LEFT takes the head to (5, 2). From (5, 2) with direction LEFT, moving LEFT again takes the head to (5, 1) to eat the apple. Path: DOWN -> LEFT -> LEFT.\n- If move LEFT: Head at (4, 2), direction LEFT. Next possible moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving DOWN takes the head to (5, 2). From (5, 2) with direction DOWN, moving LEFT takes the head to (5, 1) to eat the apple. Path: LEFT -> DOWN -> LEFT.\n\nBoth paths reach the apple in 2 more steps. The path starting with DOWN seems slightly more direct and positions the snake lower on the board initially, potentially providing more space above later. Let's choose DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#SSSSA #\n#   SS #\n#  SSS #\n# AH   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 30\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (5, 4).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nThe possible moves are:\n1.  Keep moving DOWN: The snake head would move to (6, 4). This cell is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n2.  Turn LEFT: The snake head would move to (5, 3). This cell contains the snake body ('S'). This is an invalid move (collision).\n3.  Turn RIGHT: The snake head would move to (5, 5). This cell is empty (' '). This is a valid move.\n4.  Turn UP: This is the reverse of the current direction (DOWN), so it's an invalid move. Additionally, the cell (4, 4) contains the snake body ('S'), making it a collision.\n\nThe valid moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nLet's evaluate the valid moves:\n-   Moving DOWN to (6, 4) positions the snake in an open area and allows subsequent moves LEFT towards the apple at (5, 2) or RIGHT towards the apple at (2, 6). The path to the apple at (5, 2) would be DOWN -> LEFT -> LEFT -> UP.\n-   Moving RIGHT to (5, 5) positions the snake next to the right wall. It allows subsequent moves DOWN or RIGHT. Moving UP would lead to a collision with the body at (4, 5). This move makes reaching the apple at (2, 6) feasible (e.g., RIGHT -> RIGHT -> UP...). Reaching the apple at (5, 2) becomes more complex.\n\nMoving DOWN keeps more options open and provides a clear path towards the closest apple at (5, 2) (4 moves away: DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, UP). Moving RIGHT restricts the next move (cannot go UP) and aims for a further apple (2, 6). Therefore, moving DOWN seems like a better immediate choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n# SSSA #\n#   SS #\n#  SSS #\n# AS   #\n#  H   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 3).\nThe current direction is DOWN.\nPossible moves are LEFT and RIGHT.

The next possible moves from (1, 4) are RIGHT (to 1, 5) and DOWN (to 2, 4). UP is a wall, LEFT is the new body part.\n\nBoth moves are safe and position the snake similarly regarding the nearest apples. However, moving DOWN keeps more directional options open for the subsequent move (3 options vs 2 options).

This move is safe.\n    *   RIGHT: Move head to (3, 6). This square is empty (' '). This move is safe.\n5.  Evaluate strategic options:\n    *   Move UP to (2, 5): The closest apple is at (2, 6). The next move RIGHT would eat this apple.\n    *   Move DOWN to (4, 5): The closest apples are at (5, 6) and (5, 2). Reaching (5, 6) would take two more moves (e.g., RIGHT then DOWN). Reaching (5, 2) would take several moves.\n    *   Move RIGHT to (3, 6): The closest apple is at (2, 6). The next move UP would eat this apple. However, further simulation showed this path quickly leads to a confined space with no escape routes.\n6.  Comparing UP and DOWN: Moving UP allows the snake to eat the apple at (2, 6) in the very next step. Moving DOWN requires at least two steps to eat the apple at (5, 6). Eating the closer apple sooner is generally a good strategy. The path starting with UP also appears to provide access to the apple at (5,6) relatively soon after.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","```\n########\n#SSS   #\n#S SHA #\n#S SS  #\n#S     #\n#SA   A#\n#SS    #\n########\n```\nThe current direction is UP.\nThe snake's head 'H' is at coordinates (row=2, col=3) inside the walls.\nPossible moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT (cannot move DOWN as it's the reverse of UP).\n\n1.  **Move UP:** The square above the head (row=1, col=3) contains 'S' (snake body).

The snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT is not a valid move.\n4.  Let's evaluate the other possible moves:\n    *   **UP:** Move to (1, 5). This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is good. Let's check the consequences. After moving UP, the direction becomes UP. From (1, 5), the possible next moves are UP (to (0, 5) - Wall #), LEFT (to (1, 4) - Empty ' '), RIGHT (to (1, 6) - Wall #). So, only LEFT is possible. After moving LEFT to (1, 4), the direction becomes LEFT. From (1, 4), the possible next moves are LEFT (to (1, 3) - Snake body 'S'), UP (to (0, 4) - Wall #), DOWN (to (2, 4) - Snake body 'S'). All next moves lead to collision. Therefore, moving UP leads to a trap.\n    *   **DOWN:** Move to (3, 5). This square is empty (' '). This move is safe. The new direction will be DOWN. From (3, 5), the possible next moves are DOWN (to (4, 5) - Empty ' '), LEFT (to (3, 4) - Snake body 'S'), RIGHT (to (3, 6) - Empty ' '). DOWN and RIGHT are safe moves for the subsequent step.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Move to (2, 6). This square contains a wall ('#'). This leads to collision. Game over.\n\n5.  Comparing the valid, non-fatal moves: UP leads to an immediate apple but a definite trap soon after. DOWN leads to safety and keeps options open for future moves, potentially allowing the snake to reach other apples later. Survival is necessary to eat more apples in the long run.\n\n6.

Specifically, the apple at (5, 5) can be reached in the next move by turning LEFT.\n\nMoving DOWN allows the snake to potentially eat an apple in the next step (by moving LEFT afterwards).

Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately. Let's check if this move is safe. Moving to (5, 1) is not a collision with a wall or the snake's body. After moving LEFT and eating the apple, the snake's head will be at (5, 1), and its length will increase. From (5, 1), the snake can move UP to (4, 1) or DOWN to (6, 1), both of which are currently empty and safe. Therefore, moving LEFT is both beneficial (eats an apple) and safe.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n```\n########\n#  S A #\n# ASSS #\n#  SSS #\n#    SS#\n# HSS S#\n#A  SSS#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nPossible moves:\n1.

Safe move, eat apple.\n4.  RIGHT: Cannot move RIGHT because the current direction is LEFT.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Moving LEFT leads to immediate game over.\n- Moving DOWN allows eating an apple at (6, 1). After this move, the head will be at (6, 1) and the snake grows. The state would be Head(6,1), Body includes (5,1), Direction DOWN. The only possible moves from (6,1) would be UP (to 5,1 - now body, collision) or RIGHT (to 6,2 - empty). Thus, the next move *must* be RIGHT. Let's trace one more step: Head(6,2), Body includes (6,1), Direction RIGHT. Possible moves from (6,2): UP (to 5,2 - body, collision), DOWN (to 7,2 - wall, collision), RIGHT (to 6,3 - empty). The next move *must* be RIGHT. Head(6,3), Body includes (6,2), Direction RIGHT. Possible moves from (6,3): UP (to 5,3 - body, collision), DOWN (to 7,3 - wall, collision), RIGHT (to 6,4 - body, collision). This path leads to a guaranteed collision in 3 steps.\n- Moving UP moves the head to (4, 1), an empty square. The state would be Head(4,1), Body includes (5,1), Direction UP. Possible moves from (4,1): UP (to 3,1 - empty), LEFT (to 4,0 - wall, collision), RIGHT (to 4,2 - empty). This path keeps multiple options open (UP or RIGHT) and avoids the immediate trap seen with moving DOWN.\n\nConclusion: Although moving DOWN eats an apple immediately, it leads to a forced sequence of moves ending in a collision. Moving UP is safer and strategically better as it keeps more options open for future moves.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n# ASSS #\n#  SSS #\n# H  SS#\n# SSS S#\n#A  SSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 56\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 2).

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#SS    #\n#SS ASS#\n#SSSS S#\n#SSHSSS#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 64\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","epoch":64,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
