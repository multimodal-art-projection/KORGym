The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

However, for this problem, we are asked for the next state of the board after attempting to move in the given direction.\nIf we assume that hitting a wall results in no movement for the snake, then the board remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the next state of the board is the same as the current board.\n\n########\n#    A #\n# HS  A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: NOOP (No Operation, the board remains the same as the move is invalid)\n\nActually, the prompt asks for direction from 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP', 'DOWN'.  If I have to give a direction, and the current direction is LEFT, and moving LEFT is invalid, maybe I should choose a valid direction. But the question asks \"The Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\".  This is confusing.\n\nLet's assume the question is asking \"What is the board state if we attempt to move LEFT?\".  And if it's an invalid move (wall collision), the board state remains unchanged.\n\nSo the answer is the same board.\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# HS  A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nAnd the direction to output is ...

The current direction is 'DOWN'.\nMoving 'DOWN' will move the head to position (4, 4).\nThe cell at (4, 4) is empty ' '. So the move is valid.\nThe snake's head moves to (4, 4), and the previous head position (3, 4) becomes a body segment 'S'.\nTo maintain the snake's length (as no apple is eaten), the tail segment needs to be removed.\nLet's assume the tail is the 'S' which is at the location (1, 4).\n\nAfter moving 'DOWN':\n- The cell at (3, 4) becomes 'S'.\n- The cell at (4, 4) becomes 'H'.\n- The cell at (1, 4) becomes ' '.\n\nThe updated game board will be:\n########\n#A     #\n#   SA #\n#   SS #\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#   SA #\n#   SA #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 10\n\nAssuming we move DOWN.\nThe snake's head 'H' is currently at position (5, 4) (row 5, column 4).\nMoving DOWN will take the head to position (6, 4).\nThe current head position (5, 4) will become a body segment 'S'.\nThe tail of the snake needs to be removed if no apple is eaten. Let's assume no apple is eaten in this step. The tail is the most distant 'S' segment from the head in the opposite direction of movement, which is likely the 'S' at (2, 4).\n\nLet's update the board:\n1. Replace 'H' at (5, 4) with 'S'.\n2. Place 'H' at the new position (6, 4).\n3. Clear the tail position (2, 4) to ' '.\n\nHowever, after re-examining the game board, the head 'H' is at row 5, column 5 (index (4, 4)).\nThe body segments 'S' are at (3, 5) and (4, 5) (index (2, 4) and (3, 4)).\nIf we move DOWN from head position (5, 5), the new head position will be (6, 5).\n\nLet's correct the head and body positions based on the board.\nHead 'H' is at row 5, column 5 (index (4, 4)).\nBody 'S' is at row 3, column 5 (index (2, 4)), and row 4, column 5 (index (3, 4)).\nSnake positions from head to tail (visual order): (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5).\n\nMove DOWN. New head position (6, 5). It's empty.\n1. Current head (5, 5) becomes 'S'.\n2. New head (6, 5) becomes 'H'.\n3.

Invalid.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, let's choose LEFT to explore horizontal space.\n\nIf we choose LEFT. New head position (5, 5-1) = (5, 4). It's empty.\n1. Current head (5, 5) becomes 'S'.\n2.

Moving 'LEFT' would cause the snake to hit the wall '#'. Therefore, 'LEFT' is not a valid move.\n\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so 'RIGHT' is also not a valid move.\n\nThe possible valid moves are 'UP' and 'DOWN'.\n\nIf the snake moves 'UP', the new head position would be (row=4, column=1), which is currently an empty space '#   '. This is a valid move.\n\nIf the snake moves 'DOWN', the new head position would be (row=6, column=1), which is currently an empty space '#      '. This is also a valid move.\n\nLet's choose to move 'UP'.\n\nAfter moving 'UP', the game board will be updated as follows:\n- The 'H' at (5, 1) becomes 'S'.\n- The new head 'H' is placed at (4, 1).\n- The tail of the snake at (5, 2) will be removed if no apple is eaten. In this case, no apple is eaten, so the 'S' at (5, 2) becomes ' '.\n\nThe updated game board will be:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n# H  A #\n# S    #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#H     #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 15\n\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#H     #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n########\n```\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#SH    #\n#S     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nAnswer: UP\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n# H  A #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 17\n\nDOWN\n\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n# S  A #\n#H S   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#A     #\n# H  A #\n# S  A #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n# SH A #\n# S  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 19\n\nAnswer: RIGHT\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n# SSHA #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 20\n\nDOWN\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#  SSA #\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 21\n\n########\n#A     #\n#  SSA #\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#   SA #\n#   SA #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 22\n\nAnswer: RIGHT\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#   SA #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 23\n\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#   SA #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#   SS #\n#    H #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 24\n\nAnswer: LEFT\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#    S #\n#   HS #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 25\n\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#    S #\n#  HSS #\n#      #\n########\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  HSS #\n#      #\n########\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 27\n\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n########\n```\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#  H A #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 28\n\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#  H A #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n########\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#  SHA #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#  SSHA#\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 30\n\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#  SSHA#\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to go 'UP' to avoid hitting the wall and explore the upper area where an apple is located.\n\nAnswer: UP","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#   AH #\n#  SSSA#\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 31\n\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#   AH #\n#  SSSA#\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nBased on the current board and direction, moving RIGHT seems to be a reasonable choice to avoid immediate collision and potentially get closer to the apple on the right side in the future steps.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#   ASH#\n#  SSSA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 32\n\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#   ASH#\n#  SSSA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (row=2, col=6).\nThe current direction is 'RIGHT'.\nThe possible moves are 'UP', 'DOWN', 'RIGHT'. 'LEFT' is not allowed as it is the reverse direction.\n\n- If we move 'UP', the new head position would be (row=1, col=6). The character at this position is '#', which is a wall. Thus, 'UP' is an invalid move as it leads to collision with the wall.\n\n- If we move 'DOWN', the new head position would be (row=3, col=6). The character at this position is 'A', which is an apple. Thus, 'DOWN' is a valid move and the snake will eat the apple and grow.\n\n- If we move 'RIGHT', the new head position would be (row=2, col=7). The character at this position is '#', which is a wall. Thus, 'RIGHT' is an invalid move as it leads to collision with the wall.\n\nTherefore, the only valid move is 'DOWN'.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#   ASS#\n#  SSSH#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 33\n\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#   ASS#\n#  SSSH#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#   ASS#\n#   SSS#\n#  A  H#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 34\n\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#   ASS#\n#   SSS#\n#  A  H#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#A     #\n#   ASS#\n#    SS#\n#  A  S#\n#     H#\n#      #\n########\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#   ASS#\n#     S#\n#  A  S#\n#    HS#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 36\n\n```\nLEFT\n```"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: LEFT'\n\nYou are controlling a snake in a Snake game.The board size is 8x8.In the game board. The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#   ASS#\n#     S#\n#  A  S#\n#    HS#\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: \n\nCurrent epoch: 37\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","epoch":37,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
