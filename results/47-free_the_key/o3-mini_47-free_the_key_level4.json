One step is to start shifting “A” down so that eventually its part on row 3 is moved out of the key’s way. Moving “A” one step down is our best initial move. \n\nAnswer: A down","I analyzed the board and noted that the key (“1”) is stuck in row 3 because the vertical block A (present in rows 2–4, column 4) obstructs its rightward path toward the exit (“2” in row 3, column 6). Since the key can only move horizontally, the first priority is to clear the corridor in row 3. The vertical block A (which can only move vertically) can be shifted to eventually clear the path. Moving A downward one step is a good start. This will change its positions from rows 2–4 to rows 3–5 in column 4. Although row 3 will still have an A for now, this move is a necessary step toward later moving A further down so that the key can later slide smoothly to the exit.\n\nAnswer: A down","I'll start by examining the board. The key is represented by “1” and spans row 3, columns 1–2 (horizontally). Its only allowed moves are horizontal. To reach the exit “2” at row 3, column 6, the path in row 3 must be freed. However, in row 3 column 4 there’s an “A” block. Looking at “A,” we notice it occupies three cells vertically at positions (3,4), (4,4), and (5,4). Since vertical blocks move only vertically, we can create space in row 3 by moving A. Moving A down one step would shift its cells to (4,4), (5,4), and (6,4) (all of which are currently free or already occupied by A in a contiguous formation). This move removes the blockage in row 3, column 4 and clears a path for the key to later slide to the right. \n\nThus, for the current epoch (epoch:3), the best move is to slide block A down by one step.\n\nAnswer: A down","I'll move the key one step to the right.

The row is otherwise empty. Since the key moves only horizontally and there are no obstacles on its way, the easiest move is to slide the key one step to the right. That will shift the key’s position from columns 2–3 to columns 3–4, advancing it toward the exit.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","Looking at the board, the key (represented by 1) currently occupies row 3, columns 3 and 4. To win, the key has to reach the exit (represented by 2) at row 3, column 6. The cell immediately to the right of the key (row 3, column 5) is empty (“0”), so the key is free to move right. Moving the key one step to the right will shift it so that it occupies columns 4 and 5. Then, on a subsequent turn, a second move “1 right” will shift it to columns 5 and 6, with its right end at the exit.  \n \nSince we need to provide a move for the current turn (epoch 6), the best move is to move the key right by one step: \n\nAnswer: 1 right","I'll analyze the situation first.

Since its rightmost cell is adjacent to the exit, moving the key one step to the right will shift it so that it occupies row 3’s columns 5 and 6—with the right cell landing exactly on the exit.

In the board the key (cells marked 1) is in row 3, columns 1–2 and must move right until it reaches the exit (marked 2 in row 3, column 6). Its path in row 3 is blocked by the vertical block A (occupying row 1–3, column 4). Because A can only move vertically, we must create room for it to slide downward so that row 3, column 4 becomes free. However, block A cannot move down immediately because its downward cell (row 4, column 4) is occupied by block E (a horizontal block in row 4, columns 2–4).\n\nTo free cell (4,4), we first work on block E. But E cannot go left as its left neighbor (row 4, column 1) is taken by block D (vertical, rows 4–5, column 1).

This frees row 4, column 1 so that afterward we can move E.\n\nAlthough subsequent moves will eventually shift E to free row 4, column 4 and allow A to slide down several times (so that its entire body is moved away from row 3), we only need to output one move per turn.

Because vertical blocks can only move vertically, we must eventually relocate “A” downward enough (by three steps) so that it no longer covers row3—but that won’t be possible until the cell at row4, column4 is free. Notice that the horizontal block “E” in row4 (currently covering columns2–4) is occupying that spot. Since horizontal blocks can only move sideways and row4, column1 is empty, we can shift “E” left.

Here’s the plan:\n\nEpoch 1: \n • Move block D left one step. \n  (D is horizontal; it goes from row 6, columns 3–5 to row 6, columns 2–4, leaving row 6, column 5 free.)\n\nEpoch 2: \n • Move block A down one step.\n  (A now occupies row 2–4, column 5.)\n\nEpoch 3:\n • Move block A down one more step.\n  (A now occupies row 3–5, column 5 – still blocking row 3 but preparing for full clearance.)\n\nEpoch 4:\n • Move block A down another step.\n  (A moves to row 4–6, column 5 – now row 3, column 5 is free.)\n\nWith the path on row 3 now clear (cells in columns 3, 4, and 5 are empty, with exit “2” at column 6), the key can move right.\n\nEpoch 5:\n • Move the key (1) right (its position shifts from columns 1–2 to columns 2–3).\n\nEpoch 6:\n • Move the key (1) right (to columns 3–4).\n\nEpoch 7:\n • Move the key (1) right (to columns 4–5).\n\nEpoch 8:\n • Move the key (1) right (to columns 5–6, where its right cell reaches the exit).\n\nThis sequence clears the path and gets the key into the exit successfully.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","I'll analyze the board:\n\nRow1: C 0 0 0 A 0\nRow2: C 0 0 0 A 0\nRow3: 0 1 1 0 A 2\nRow4: 0 E E E 0 F\nRow5: 0 B B B 0 F\nRow6: 0 0 D D D 0\n\nThe key (represented by “1”) is in row3 at columns 2–3. To exit to the right (column6 of row3 marked “2”), the key must eventually move right. However, the path is blocked by piece A, which is a vertical block (occupying col5 in rows1–3), and vertical blocks can only move vertically. To free the key’s path, piece A needs to get out of row3. A possible plan is to eventually move piece A down so it no longer occupies row3—but piece A cannot move down unless the destination cells (below its bottom cell) are free. In its current state, A occupies row1–3 at column5. To move far enough down, we must ensure that row6 col5 is empty. Row6 currently shows D D D at columns3–5, with piece D moving only horizontally and blocking row6 col5.\n\nThus, the immediate step is to move piece D left (horizontal move) so that its rightmost cell (currently at row6 col5) is freed. Checking that move: row6 “D” moves one step left from columns 3–5 to columns 2–4 (with row6 col2 empty). This clears row6 col5. \n\nSo for our move at epoch 2 the answer is:\n\nAnswer: D left","Based on the board, the blockage is caused by block A, which is vertical and occupies (row1,col5), (row2,col5) and (row3,col5). The key (the two “1” tiles in row3 at columns 2 and 3) must eventually travel right in row3 toward the exit at (row3,col6), but the cell at row3 col5 is blocked by A. To clear row3 col5, block A must be moved downward enough so that none of its cells stay in row3. Moving it down one or two steps still leaves a part in row3. Thus, the plan is to eventually move A down three times. \n\nSince we are at epoch 3 and can only move one step per turn, the best move now is to begin shifting A by one step downward.\n\nA down\n\nAnswer: A down","I analyzed the board. The vertical block A currently occupies row2–row4 in column 5 and blocks the key (located in row3, columns 2–3) from moving right toward the exit at row3, column 6. Because A is vertical it can only move vertically. To clear row3 from block A, we need to shift it down so that eventually its cells will be in rows4–6. A one‐step “down” move will shift block A from rows2–4 to rows3–5 (still occupying row3), but it is the necessary first move. In this epoch (epoch 4) the best move is to start moving A down. \n\nAnswer: A down","We note that the key (represented by 1) is horizontal and must get to the exit (2) at row 3, column 6. Right now the key occupies row 3, columns 2–3 while a vertical block A occupies row 3, column 5 (as well as row 4 and row 5 in column 5), blocking its path. Because A is a vertical block, it can only move vertically. Although it could potentially go up, the better solution is to slide it down—moving it down one step will free row 3, column 5 so the key’s path is open.\n\nThus we can do the following:\n1. Move block A down (from rows 3–5 to rows 4–6, which is allowed since row 6, column 5 is free). This vacates row 3, column 5.\n2. Then, move the key right three times. Specifically:\n • First “1 right” shifts the key from occupying columns 2–3 to columns 3–4.\n • Next “1 right” moves it to occupy columns 4–5.\n • Finally “1 right” moves it so that it occupies columns 5–6, with its rightmost cell now overlapping the exit.\n\nSequence of moves:\nA down\n1 right\n1 right\n1 right\n\nAnswer: A down, 1 right, 1 right, 1 right","First, note that the board is a 6×6 grid.

Because vertical blocks can only move vertically and the key can only move horizontally, we want to clear row 3, column 5. Since “A” is vertical, we cannot move it left\/right; we must move it up or down. Moving “A” up would leave row 3, column 5 still occupied (it would then cover rows 2–4), but moving “A” down is legal because row 6, column 5 is empty. In that move, block “A” will shift from rows 3–5 to rows 4–6, thereby freeing row 3, column 5.\n\nOnce “A” is moved down, the key in row 3 can move right into the space at column 4 (first right‐move), then further right into the now-free column 5 (second right‐move), and finally move so that it occupies columns 5–6; since column 6 is the exit, that move wins the game.\n\nThus, the sequence of moves is:\n• Epoch 7: Move block A down (A down).\n• Epoch 8: Move the key one step to the right (1 right).\n• Epoch 9: Move the key one step to the right (1 right).\n• Epoch 10: Move the key one step to the right (1 right).\n\nIn the required format, the moves are output one by one and the final response line states all moves.\n\nAnswer: A down, 1 right, 1 right, 1 right","The best move is to shift block A one step downward.

The key is positioned horizontally on row2 (using 0-indexed rows) and currently sits in columns 0 and 1. The path in row2 is blocked at column 3 by block A, which is a vertical block occupying row0–row2 in column3. In order to clear row2 col3, we must shift A out of the way – and since A can only move vertically, its only option is to move down. However, for A to shift down one step it must have row3 col3 free. But row3 col3 is presently occupied by block F (a horizontal block spanning row3 columns 2, 3, and 4). \n\nBlock F can only move horizontally. In one step a left or right move still leaves one end in column 3; however, by starting to shift block F we set the stage to eventually free row3 col3. For example, if we eventually move F left twice it will occupy columns 0, 1, and 2 and row3 col3 will be free so that A can drop down. \n\nSince we’re at epoch 2, the optimal move now is to start shifting F. I choose to move block F left by one step.\n\nAnswer: F left","I'll start by outlining my reasoning briefly. We see that the key “1” currently occupies row3 columns1–2 and must eventually move right toward the exit “2” at row3 column6. However, the block “A” in column4 (spanning rows1–3) currently blocks the key when it tries to move right. Because block “A” is vertical it can only move up or down, and moving it up isn’t possible since it already occupies the top row. So “A” must move down. But to move down, “A” needs row4 column4 to be free and we notice that block “F” in row4 (occupying columns2–4) currently occupies that cell. Fortunately, “F” is a horizontal block and can be moved left if row4 column1 is free. Since row4 column1 is indeed empty, our immediate move is to shift “F” left. This clears up row4 column4, allowing “A” to eventually move down to free the path for the key.\n\nBased on this reasoning, my move at this epoch is:\n\nF left\n\nAnswer: F left","I analyzed the board as follows (using 0‐based row indices for clarity):\n\n• Row0: 0, D, D, A, 0, 0  \n• Row1: 0, E, E, A, 0, 0  \n• Row2: 1, 1, 0, A, 0, 2  \n• Row3: F, F, F, 0, 0, 0  \n• Row4: 0, 0, C, C, 0, 0  \n• Row5: B, B, 0, 0, 0, 0  \n\nThe key (denoted “1”) is the horizontal piece in row2 (columns 0 and 1).

Since the key moves only horizontally, we must clear its way by moving “A” out of row2, column3.\n\nBlock A is vertical so it can only move vertically. Shifting A upward is not possible (its top would go off‐board) and moving it down one step would still leave it in row2 (it would then occupy rows1–3 in column3). To completely clear row2, A must eventually be moved down twice more to end up occupying rows3–5, freeing row2. But A cannot move down a second time immediately because its intended new bottom cell would be row4, column3, which is currently occupied by block “C.”\n\nBlock C is horizontal (occupying row4, columns2–3) and can only move horizontally. Fortunately, moving C left is allowed (since row4, column1 is empty) and doing so will free row4, column3.

Since the key’s path is blocked by A at row2 column3, we want to eventually shift A fully below row2.

We need to clear the way by eventually moving A downward so that the third column becomes empty. However, A (which occupies cells in rows 1–3 of column 3) cannot be moved up (because row 1 is the boundary) and if moved down immediately it still occupies row 3. One solution is to eventually move block A more than one step downward so that it moves completely off row 3. That, however, is prevented by block B at the bottom row (row 6) because when A is moved down to occupy rows 4–6, it would run into the B block if B is still in columns 1–3.\n\nBecause block B is a horizontal block (it moves only left and right) and initially occupies row 6 in columns 1–3, we can move it rightwards so that it no longer interferes when we later slide A downward. Moving B three steps to the right will shift it from occupying columns 1–3 to occupying columns 4–6. This will clear column 3 on row 6 and let A move safely down over successive turns. Then A can be moved down gradually (three moves: from rows 1–3 to rows 2–4, then to rows 3–5, and finally to rows 4–6) so that row 3 becomes free for the key “1” (which can only move horizontally).

However, because A is vertical it must move vertically. Moving it downward step‐by‐step requires that when A finally reaches rows 4–6 the destination cell at row 6, column 3 is free. At the moment, block B (a horizontal block on row 6 at columns 2–4) is in the way: if A were moved downward too far now, it would collide with B. Therefore, before moving A, we need to reposition block B. Since B is horizontal it can only move left\/right. Shifting B two steps to the right will free up row 6, column 3.

Although a single down move won’t fully clear row2 column2, it is the first step in shifting A out of the key’s path (by eventually moving it down three times so that A occupies rows 3, 4, and 5). Since we are allowed only one step per turn and the key can move only horizontally, my best move now is to move block A one step down.\n\nAnswer: A down","We have a clear path if we first clear the way for the key. Notice that the vertical block “A” is currently blocking the cell immediately right of the key (cell (3,3)). Because “A” is vertical it can only move up or down. Moving “A” one step up still leaves it in row3 (its cells would be in rows1–3), so that does not clear the key’s path. However, if we move “A” down twice the block shifts to rows4–6 in column 3 and cell (3,3) becomes free.\n\nThen the key (which is horizontal and currently occupies cells (3,1) and (3,2)) has an open path. The key can then move right repeatedly until it covers the exit at (3,6). For example, here is one valid sequence of moves:\n1. Move “A” down (block A goes from rows2–4 to rows3–5).\n2. Move “A” down again (block A goes from rows3–5 to rows4–6 so that row3, col3 is now free).\n3. Move the key (“1”) right (key moves from columns1–2 to columns2–3).\n4. Move “1” right (now covering columns3–4).\n5. Move “1” right (now covering columns4–5).\n6. Move “1” right (finally the key covers columns5–6 with the exit in column6).\n\nThus, by epoch 11 the key will have reached the exit.

Its path to the exit (marked “2”, at row3 column6) is blocked by block A, which occupies row2–4 in column3. Noticing that block A is vertical and cannot move horizontally, the only way to eventually free row3, column3 is to shift it downward so that its top cell lifts off row3. Moving A one step down will shift it from rows2–4 to rows3–5; although row3, column3 will still be occupied, this move sets up a two‐move plan where a subsequent “A down” would move the A block to rows4–6, thereby clearing row3 and opening the horizontal path for the key. \n\nAt the current epoch, my move is to shift block A downward by one step. \n\nAnswer: A down","I'll start by clearing the obstacle immediately blocking the key’s horizontal path.

The vertical block A currently occupies row 3, column 4. Our plan is to eventually slide block A downward (after shifting block D so that its cells in row 6 won’t block A’s move) so that row 3 becomes free.\n\nLooking at the board, the lowest layer has block D (cells at row 6, columns 4–6). In order for block A to move down far enough (three steps) for row 3 to be cleared, we must first free row 6, column 4. Block D is horizontal and can be moved left.

However, the vertical block A currently sits in column 3 (occupying rows 0, 1, and 2) and blocks a straight move. Because block A can only move vertically, its “clearing” path downward is needed.

However, when moving A down three times the final move would force block A into row 6, column 4. Notice that row 6 already has block D (a horizontal block occupying columns 2–4). To avoid that collision, we must first clear room on the bottom row.\n\nSince block D can only move horizontally, the best course is to shift it left so that it occupies columns 1–3. This frees row 6, column 4 and then allows us (in later epochs) to move A fully downward and then shift the key right step–by–step into the exit.\n\nThus, as the very first move on the current epoch (epoch 5), I choose to shift block D left.\n\nAnswer: D left","I analyze the board.

However, block A in column 4 is blocking a clear horizontal passage from the key to the exit. One effective strategy is to clear row3 by shifting block A out of it.

Therefore, our first step is to reposition block E out of the way. By moving block E left, we can eventually free row6 column3 so that block A can move downward when the time comes.\n\nAnswer: E left","Here’s one winning plan. Notice that the key (represented by “1”) is stuck because block A (a vertical three‐cell block in column 2) prevents it from moving right. In order for the key (which moves only horizontally) to eventually reach the exit (“2” at row2, column5) the cell immediately to its right (row2, col2) must be cleared. Since block A can only move vertically it must be pushed far enough so that it no longer covers row2. (A vertical block that spans three cells will free row2 only if its entire 3‐cell “column‐span” is shifted away from that row.) \n\nHowever, a problem appears: moving A downward from its initial position (occupying rows0, 1, 2 at col2) one step gives rows1–3, which still covers row2; two steps gives rows2–4 (still row2 is occupied) … Only after three downward moves does A cover rows3–5, which frees row2.\n\nThere is one catch: on the very third move down A would have to occupy row5, column2—but currently row5, col2 is taken by block E (a horizontal block occupying row5, columns1–2). Hence the plan is to first move E to the left. That move shifts E from row5, columns1–2 to row5, columns0–1 so that row5, col2 becomes empty. Then you can push block A down three times. Once A is moved (so that row2, col2 is free), the key can slide right. The key is two cells wide and starts at row2, columns0–1; to have its right end hit the exit at column5 you need four moves to the right.\n\nExplicitly the moves (one move per turn) are:\n\n1.

Move block A down (second time, now occupies rows2–4, col2).\n4. Move block A down (third time, now occupies rows3–5, col2; row2, col2 is free).\n5.

To clear row 3, “A” must be moved downward (moving it up is impossible without going off the board). If we move “A” down three steps, its cells would then be in rows 4–6 and row 3 would be freed. \nOn the current epoch (epoch 5) we are allowed only one move. So the best immediate move is to move “A” one step downward. This will change “A”’s positions from rows 1–3 to rows 2–4 in column 3.

Notice that the key (“1”) starts in row 2 covering columns 0–1, but the vertical block A (in column 2, rows 1–3) is blocking its way.

(Since A is three cells tall, if we can move it two steps down so that it occupies rows 3–5 instead, row 2 will be free.) However, A cannot be moved two steps down in a row because at its lower move the destination (row 5, col 2) is occupied by the horizontal block E (in row 5, columns 1–2). So we must move E first.\n\nOne correct sequence is as follows (each “Answer:” line is one move):\n\n• Epoch6: Move block A downward one step. This shifts A from rows 1–3 to rows 2–4 in column 2.\n• Epoch7: Move block E left by one step. Since E is horizontal (originally in row 5, columns 1–2), moving it left puts it in row 5, columns 0–1. Now row 5, col 2 is free.\n• Epoch8: Move block A down one more step. Now A occupies rows 3–5 in column 2, so row 2 is clear.\n• With A out of the way in row 2, the key (which moves only horizontally) can now slide right. Starting with the key covering row 2, columns 0–1, we need to advance it step‐by‐step to the exit at row 2, col 5.\n• Epoch9: Move key “1” right → now covers columns 1–2.\n• Epoch10: Move “1” right → now covers columns 2–3.\n• Epoch11: Move “1” right → now covers columns 3–4.\n• Epoch12: Move “1” right → now covers columns 4–5, with the exit (cell with “2”) on its right.\n\nThus, by the 12th epoch the key reaches the exit.\n\nIn summary, the moves are:\n\nAnswer: A down\nAnswer: E left\nAnswer: A down\nAnswer: 1 right\nAnswer: 1 right\nAnswer: 1 right\nAnswer: 1 right\n\nAnswer: 1 right","I'll choose to begin by repositioning block E. Since A (which blocks the key’s path) cannot be moved downward to clear row2 until row5 col2 is freed, we must first free that cell. Block E occupies row5 col1 and col2 and can only slide horizontally, so moving E left will vacate row5 col2. This will later allow us to slide block A down twice so that it no longer covers row2. \n\nThus, for this epoch I will move block E one step to the left.\n\nAnswer: E left","I'll start by looking at the board. We see that the key (the two “1” blocks) is in row 3, columns 1–2 and must eventually move right until it reaches the exit “2” in row 3, column 6. However, currently the vertical block “A” occupies row 3, column 3 (it occupies row2 col3, row3 col3, and row4 col3), and because vertical blocks can only move vertically, its only way to clear row 3 is to shift completely out of that row. (Moving it one step either up or down keeps one cell in row 3.) In order to free up row 3, “A” must eventually be moved two steps in one direction (for example, down on two successive moves so that it occupies rows 4–6), which would clear row 3 and allow the key to slide right.\n\nSince we are at epoch 8 and must make a move now, the best strategic step is to start shifting “A”. In this turn, we move “A” one step downward. (Later moves can continue to shift “A” downward so that row 3 becomes completely free.)\n\nAnswer: A down","We first note that the key (“1”) is currently stuck on row 3 in columns 1–2, but its path toward the exit (“2” in row 3, column 6) is blocked by the vertical “A” block in column 3. Since vertical blocks can only move up or down, the clear plan is to move block “A” downward so that its top cell leaves row 3. (Recall that “A” currently occupies row 3–5, column 3.) By moving “A” one step down the new positions become row 4, row 5 and row 6, column 3; that frees row 3, column 3 so that the key may slide right.\n\nNow the key, which only moves horizontally, can slide right one step at a time. Initially occupying row 3, columns 1–2, a right move shifts it to columns 2–3, then another right shift puts it at columns 3–4, a third move gives columns 4–5, and a fourth move puts its right half on column 6 where the exit “2” is located. In summary, the move sequence is as follows:\n\n1. Move block A down    (This frees row 3, column 3.)\n2. Move key “1” right   (Key goes to columns 2–3.)\n3. Move key “1” right   (Key goes to columns 3–4.)\n4. Move key “1” right   (Key goes to columns 4–5.)\n5. Move key “1” right   (Key goes to columns 5–6, reaching the exit.)\n\nThus, following these moves, the key successfully reaches the exit. \n\nAnswer: 1 right","The idea is to remove the obstacle blocking the key’s horizontal path. Notice that in row 3 the key (the two 1’s) is trapped on the left by the A‐block (located at (3,3)). Since A is vertical and can only move vertically, we can slide it down. Moving A down shifts its cells from (3,3),(4,3),(5,3) to (4,3),(5,3),(6,3), thereby clearing cell (3,3).\n\nOnce A has moved down, row 3 becomes fully open between the key’s current position and the exit at (3,6). The key, which only moves horizontally, can then move right one step at a time until its right part reaches the exit. Specifically, the sequence is as follows:\n\n1. Move A down.\n  • This moves block A from positions (3,3),(4,3),(5,3) to (4,3),(5,3),(6,3).\n2. Move the key (1) right.\n  • The key moves from (3,1)-(3,2) to (3,2)-(3,3).\n3. Move the key (1) right.\n  • The key moves to (3,3)-(3,4).\n4. Move the key (1) right.\n  • The key moves to (3,4)-(3,5).\n5. Move the key (1) right.\n  • The key moves to (3,5)-(3,6), where the exit (2) is located.\n\nThus, with these moves the key can successfully reach the exit.\n\nAnswer: A down, 1 right, 1 right, 1 right, 1 right","We first notice that the key occupies row 3, columns 1 and 2 and must travel right until its right cell reaches the exit at row 3, column 6. However, the cell immediately to the right of the key (row 3, column 3) is currently blocked by part of block A. (Block A is vertical, covering row 3, col 3; row 4, col 3; and row 5, col 3.) Since the key can only move horizontally, we must free its path by moving block A away from row 3.\n\nBecause block A is vertical, it can only move up or down. Moving it upward (e.g. up by one or even two steps) would keep part of it in row 3, still blocking the key.

In our solution the idea is to “free‐the row” so the key (the “1”) in row 3 can slide right all the way to the exit (the “2” at row 3, col 6). The key cannot move vertically and the vertical block A (initially occupying row1–row3, col3) blocks its path. Because A can only move vertically, we must “make room” for A to shift down far enough so that row 3 becomes free. (Note that A – being three cells long – must be moved down twice so that it ends up in rows4–6.) However, A cannot move directly because its downward move is blocked by F (a horizontal block) in row4. Therefore, we first move F left – its only legal horizontal move – to clear row4, col3. Then we move A down one step (so it goes into rows2–4). At that point A still covers row3, so we must eventually move it down two more steps. But the next move down for A is prevented because its “should‐be” new bottom cell (row5, col3) is occupied by C (a horizontal block in row5). We can’t change C’s vertical placement so we must slide C out of the way. (Since C is horizontal it can slide only left or right. Moving it left would still leave a cell over col3, so we opt to slide it right by two moves so that it occupies cells in columns 4, 5, and 6.) There is one more potential obstruction: in row5 column6 the vertical block D (occupying rows4–6, col6) stands in the way. To free that cell for C we move D upward twice (its only vertical “free‐space” is up) so that it no longer blocks C’s eventual shift. Now with row5, col3 free we can move A down two more times so that A clears row3 altogether. Finally with row3 now totally unobstructed the key (which is horizontal and begins at row3, columns1–2) may slide right step‐by‐step until its right cell coincides with the exit (at row3, col6).\n\nOne valid move–by–move sequence (each move is one epoch) is as follows:\n\n1. Epoch 1 – Move F left (F goes from row4, cols2–3 → row4, cols1–2).  \n2. Epoch 2 – Move A down (A goes from rows1–3 → rows2–4 in col3).  \n3. Epoch 3 – Move D up (D goes from rows4–6 in col6 → rows3–5 in col6).  \n4. Epoch 4 – Move D up (D goes from rows3–5 → rows2–4 in col6).  \n5. Epoch 5 – Move C right (C goes from row5, cols2–4 → row5, cols3–5).  \n6. Epoch 6 – Move C right (C goes from row5, cols3–5 → row5, cols4–6, thus freeing row5 col3).  \n7. Epoch 7 – Move A down (A goes from rows2–4 → rows3–5 in col3).  \n8. Epoch 8 – Move A down (A goes from rows3–5 → rows4–6 in col3; now row3 is free).  \n9. Epoch 9 – Move the key (1) right (key goes from row3, cols1–2 → cols2–3).  \n10. Epoch 10 – Move 1 right (key goes to cols3–4).  \n11. Epoch 11 – Move 1 right (key goes to cols4–5).  \n12. Epoch 12 – Move 1 right (key goes to cols5–6, with its right cell landing on the exit).\n\nSince the final move is “1 right,” the very last (required formatted) output line is:\n\nAnswer: 1 right","We need to free the path for the key from (2,0)-(2,1) to the exit at (2,5). Currently, block A (at positions (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)) blocks the key’s path, but it can only move vertically. It cannot move upward (would run off the board) and its downward move is blocked by the F block (which covers (3,1) and (3,2)). \n\nThe solution is to clear the space below block A by moving F horizontally. Since F is horizontal, we can move it left from row3 so that it occupies (3,0) and (3,1), leaving (3,2) open. This move will allow block A to later move down and clear the key’s path.\n\nAnswer: F left","I’ll try a move that begins opening a passage along row3. Notice that the key “1 1” lies on row3 (in columns 1–2) and the vertical “A” is blocking its way at column 3. Since vertical blocks can move only vertically and the key only horizontally, we must reposition A so that row3 becomes clear. In a 6×6 board with rows numbered 1–6 (with row1 at the top), A currently spans rows 1, 2 and 3 in column 3. (It appears as “A” in row1, row2 and row3.) The only legal move is to slide A vertically. Although moving A down by one still leaves A in row3, further moves later – after we rearrange other blocks if needed – will eventually shift A completely off row3. (A vertical block such as A must be moved several steps so that its occupied row changes; the key, which cannot move vertically, then has a free horizontal path.) \n\nThus, for the current epoch (epoch 3), a good first move is to command A to move down one step. \n\nAnswer: A down","We need to clear the key’s path along row3 so that it can eventually slide right toward the exit at column 6. Right now, the key occupies row3, columns 1–2 but is immediately blocked by the vertical block A at row3, column 3. Block A (which spans rows 2–4 in column 3) can only be moved vertically. To clear row3, A must be moved down far enough so that it no longer occupies row3; that means moving it from rows 2–4 to rows 4–6. However, moving A down one step would require row6, column 3 to be free. At present, block B (a horizontal block occupying row6, columns 2–3) obstructs that cell.\n\nThus, our first move should be to free up row6, column 3. Since block B is horizontal and can only move horizontally, we can slide it left – as cell (6,1) is free. By moving B left (so that it occupies row6, columns 1–2), row6, column 3 becomes available. This will then allow us in subsequent moves to move A downward, which in turn will clear the key’s way.\n\nHence, the move at epoch 4 is: move block B left.\n\nAnswer: B left","I'll start by explaining the reasoning briefly. In this board the key (represented by “1”) is in row 3 (third line) and needs to go to the exit “2” at the right‐end of that same row. However, the vertical block “A” in column 3 currently blocks the key’s horizontal path. Because a vertical block always covers three consecutive rows, we cannot “slide it” completely out of row 3 unless it’s moved far enough away—in this case two steps down. But it turns out that “A” cannot move down until the horizontal block “C” (in row 5) allows room. In fact, block “C” in row 5 occupies cells including the critical column that “A” needs to move into. In order to eventually shift “C” far enough (by moving it two steps to the right) to clear the entry point for “A,” we first must free up the extra column on its right; this column (column 5 in row 5) is held by vertical block “D” (which occupies rows 4–6 in that column). \n\nThus, a promising initial maneuver is to move block “D” upward. (Moving “D” up frees cell (row 4, col5) and is legal for a vertical block.) Once “D” is moved up, we’ll be able to shift “C” two steps to the right—the only horizontal way to eventually clear row 5, thereby letting “A” move down two steps and free row 2 (or row 3 in the board’s original numbering) entirely for the key’s horizontal progress.\n\nSo my recommended move at the current epoch is to move block “D” up.\n\nAnswer: D up","I analyze the board and see that the key “1” (occupying row3, columns1–2) is blocked by block “A” (occupying row2–4, column3). To eventually allow “A” to move downward (which is the only way to free row3, column3) we must clear its downward path. That cell (row5, column3) is presently blocked by the horizontal “C” (in row5, columns2–4). In order to shift “C” far enough right to vacate column3, we must eventually free its destination cell (row5, column6) which is occupied by the vertical “D” (in row3–5, column6).\n\nA good first step is to move “E” (in row2, columns5–6) left. By doing so we free row2, column6 so that later “D” can move upward. Once “D” shifts upward (freeing row5, column6), we can move “C” to the right twice (so that “C” no longer occupies column3 in row5), then move “A” down two steps (so that row3, column3 becomes free), and finally let the key slide right to the exit.\n\nSince only one move is allowed per turn and we’re at epoch6, the best immediate move is:\n\nE left\n\nAnswer: E left","I'll start by analyzing the board. We see that the key (1) occupies row 3, columns 1–2 and must travel horizontally to the right toward the exit. However, its path along row 3 is blocked by the vertical block A (in row2–4, column 3). For block A to move (it can only travel vertically), we must free the lower space by moving the horizontal block C that lies in row 5 (columns 2–4). Notice that if we move C to the right (its allowed direction for a horizontal block), then row5, column3 will be freed, creating space for A to move down in a subsequent move. Once A has been relocated downward, the key will have a free path (column 3 on row 3) to start moving right toward the exit.\n\nThus, a good next move is to shift block C one step to the right.\n\nAnswer: C right","I’ll start by “preparing the stage” so that later the key (marked by “1”) can eventually slide all the way to the right (the exit) in its row. In the current board the key in row 3 (its two “1” cells at the left) cannot move right because its next cell (in column 3 of row 3) is blocked by part of block A. Block A is vertical (its three cells line up in one column) so it cannot shift sideways. In order for the key to eventually have an unobstructed horizontal path, we must eventually displace block A completely off row 3. Because A’s length is three, the only way to “clear” row 3 is to move it entirely downward (or upward) – for example, if we could move it down two moves then it would occupy rows 4–6 and free row 3 for the key’s passage. However, currently A cannot move downward because the cell into which its bottom would slide (in row 5, column 3) is occupied by block C. (Recall horizontal blocks like C can only move left or right.) So our first priority is to free up that cell. Notice that block C (in row 5) spans columns 3–5. It can slide horizontally. To be able to shift C to the right, its destination cell on the right must be empty. Right now that cell (row 5, column 6) is occupied by block D. (Block D is vertical so moves only vertically.) Thus if we make a move with block D so that row 5, column 6 becomes empty, then C could move right in a subsequent move. With C moved right, row 5, column 3 will become available. Then block A will be allowed to move downward twice so that none of its cells resides in row 3, freeing the horizontal corridor for the key. Finally, the key (which can only slide horizontally) will have a clear route to the exit on the right side.\n\nSo as the very first step in this rescue plan (at epoch 8), I will move block D upward. This move shifts D upward so that its bottom cell in row 5, column 6 is vacated and will soon allow block C “to go right.”\n\nAnswer: D up","I'll start by analyzing the board. We have a key “1” that occupies row3, columns 1–2. To eventually have the key exit on the right, every cell from its current row must be free. Right now cell (row3, col3) is occupied by the vertical block “A” (which occupies row2–row4, column3). Because the key itself can only move horizontally, we must clear row3, column3. Notice that “A” is vertical; when it moves vertically it always covers three consecutive rows. In order for “A” not to block row3, we need to “shift” it completely out of row3. (A single move up would put “A” in rows1–3 and a single move down would put it in rows3–5, still blocking row3.) However, if we can move “A” two steps downward then it will occupy rows4–6 and leave row3 free.\n\nThere’s a problem, though: initially “A” sits in rows2–4. To move “A” down one step, the new bottom cell (row5, col3) must be empty. But row5, col3 is currently occupied by block “C” (which fills row5, columns3–5). Because “C” is horizontal it can move only horizontally. Fortunately, we can shift “C” to the right if the cell to its right of its right end is empty. In row5 the rightmost piece of “C” is in column5 and column6 is 0. So “C” can move right.\n\nThus, the proper first move is to move “C” right; this will free up row5, column3 so that later “A” can move down twice (moving “A” down two turns would leave row3 free for the key to advance toward the exit).\n\nSince we are at current epoch 9 and must output one move per turn, the correct move now is:\n\nC right\n\nAnswer: C right","The best immediate move is to work on clearing the key’s path. Notice that the key is in row 3 (covering columns 1–2) and needs to move right but is blocked by block A in column 3. Since block A is vertical and currently covers rows 2–4, a one‐step move down will move it to rows 3–5. Although that still leaves row 3 occupied, we can plan to move A down a second time in a future turn so that it then occupies rows 4–6—freeing row 3 entirely for the key’s advancement. Therefore, at the current epoch, the best move is to move block A one step down.\n\nAnswer: A down","I'll use the following strategy. From the board the key “1” is on row2 (columns 0–1) and is blocked by block A at row2,col2. In order for the key to eventually move horizontally to the exit on the right, the obstruction must be removed. Since block A is vertical, it can only move vertically. Although moving A upward wouldn’t free row2,col2, moving it downward will shift its body from row2 to row5, thereby freeing row2,col2 for the key. (Later moves will be needed to clear block D blocking the far‐right column, but at this epoch a good first step is to free space next to the key.)\n\nThus my move is to move block A down one step.\n\nAnswer: A down","I analyzed the board. Notice that the key (represented as “1”) is on row 3 (in the left‐side two cells) and needs to exit the board on the right. The vertical block “D” in column 6 (occupying rows 2–4) is immediately in the key’s future path. In order to eventually free up row 3’s column 6, we must reconfigure the pieces. However, as the key moves only horizontally and other blocks have fixed moving directions, our first step is to begin advancing the key into its exit row.\n\nSince row 3, column 3 is free, the simplest immediate move is to slide the key 1 step right. This places the key on row 3, occupying columns 2 and 3. Later turns will involve moving the vertical block “D” (and possibly others) to clear column 6 so the key can continue its path to the exit. \n\nThus, my answer is: 1 right\n\nAnswer: 1 right","I decide in epoch 13 to advance the key one step to the right. This begins opening the horizontal path toward the exit.

Notice that although several moves are needed, the ultimate (last) move is a one‐step slide of the key (“1”) to the right so that it can finally exit.

(A is vertical; by shifting it upward its presence in row 2 is removed.)\n• Epoch17: Move block A up again. (Now A occupies rows 1–3 in column 2, freeing row 4 col2.)\n• Epoch18: Move block C left. (C is horizontal in row 4; the gap at col2 lets it shift left so that its rightmost cell—the one at col5—is cleared.)\n• Epoch19: Move block D down. (D is vertical in col5 and by moving down one step it now occupies rows 2–4.)\n• Epoch20: Move block D down again. (Now D sits in rows 3–5 in col5, clearing row2 col5.)\n• Epoch21: Move the key (1) one step right. (The key moves from columns 3–4 to columns 4–5.)\n• Epoch22: Finally, move the key (1) one step right so that it reaches and exits at the right border.\n\nIn our record the ultimate decisive move is “1 right.” \n\nAnswer: 1 right","My move is to shift block A upward. By moving A up, we begin freeing the space to allow the C block to slide left later, which in turn will enable block D (blocking the key’s path) to move downward. This series of moves should eventually clear the path on row 3 so the key (1) can move right to exit.\n\nAnswer: A up","I analyzed the board and found that the key (represented by “1”, which occupies row 3 columns 4–5) is blocked on its right by block D (a vertical block occupying row 2–4, column 6). In order for the key to slide to the right (and eventually exit at the right border), we must free cell (row 3, column 6). Because D is vertical it can only move vertically, but a one‑step move does not clear row 3. In fact, if we move D two steps downward then row 3, column 6 becomes free. However, D’s downward move is blocked by block C in row 5 (where C is a horizontal block initially filling row 5 columns 4–6). To clear the way for D’s two steps downward, we must first move block C to the left; but row 5, column 3 is occupied by block A (a vertical block filling row 3–5, column 3). (Remember that vertical blocks only slide vertically, and horizontal blocks only slide horizontally.) \n\nHere is the plan step‐by‐step:\n\n1. Move block A upward by one step.  \n • This is legal because A is vertical, and row 2, column 3 is empty.  \n • Result: A now occupies row 2–4, column 3, freeing row 5, column 3.\n\n2. Move block C left by one step.  \n • C is horizontal; by shifting left into the just‑freed cell (row 5, column 3) it now occupies columns 3–5.  \n • This frees the far right cell of its original row (row 5, column 6).\n\n3. Move block D downward by one step.  \n • D is vertical. One step down shifts its cells from row 2–4, column 6 to row 3–5, column 6.  \n • (Row 5, column 6 is now free because C moved left.)\n\n4. Move block D downward one more step.  \n • Now D moves from row 3–5, column 6 to row 4–6, column 6.  \n • As a result, row 3, column 6 becomes empty.\n\n5. Finally, move the key (“1”) right by one step.  \n • The key (which can only move horizontally) now slides into row 3, columns 5–6 – its right cell (column 6) is free, meaning it is arriving at (or through) the exit on the right.\n\nThus the move that finally lets the key go right is “1 right.”\n\nBelow (each turn increments the epoch) is our move sequence:\n\nTurn 1 (epoch 16 → 17): A up  \nTurn 2 (epoch 17 → 18): C left  \nTurn 3 (epoch 18 → 19): D down  \nTurn 4 (epoch 19 → 20): D down  \nTurn 5 (epoch 20 → 21): 1 right\n\nThe final move is to slide the key one step to the right.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","Our plan is to first create room for moving the blocks blocking the key’s exit path. Notice that the vertical block A (which occupies row2,col2; row3,col2; row4,col2) is preventing the horizontal block C (currently at row4,cols3–5) from shifting left. By moving A up one step we free row4,col2 so that C can later be moved left. Once C moves left, block D (vertical, currently in col5 rows1–3) can later be moved downward in two steps so that row2,col5 becomes free for the key to shift right. Finally the key (the “1” pieces in row2,cols3–4) can move right into the now-free space, reaching the board’s right side (its exit).\n\nSince we are at epoch 17, our first move is to move block A upward to begin opening the pathway.\n\nAnswer: A up","I'll start by analyzing the board. Remember that horizontal (letters that lie in a row) blocks can only slide left\/right and vertical blocks (those arranged in a column) only up\/down. The key (represented by 1) moves only horizontally. Our board is\n\n Row1: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n Row2: 0 0 A E E D\n Row3: 0 0 A 1 1 D\n Row4: F F A 0 0 D\n Row5: 0 0 0 C C C\n Row6: B B 0 0 0 0\n\nIdentifying the blocks:\n• Block A is in column 3 on rows2–4 so it is vertical.\n• Blocks E, F, C, and B appear in a row so they are horizontal.\n• Block D is in column6 on rows2–4 so it is vertical.\n• The key (1) is in row3, columns4–5.\n\nThe idea is that the key must travel right (horizontally) to reach the exit (which is along the right side). However, the key’s rightmost cell (row3‑col6) is currently blocked by vertical block D. Because vertical blocks have no sideways freedom, we must move D vertically so that it no longer prevents the key from entering col6. To allow D to slide further down, we need to clear its target path. In its downward direction, D would need row5‑col6 free. At the moment, row5‑col6 is occupied by block C (which, being horizontal, can move left\/right). So the first move should be to move block C left, shifting it from columns4–6 to columns3–5 on row5; this frees col6 on row5 and will later allow block D to move down twice so that row3‑col6 is unoccupied. Finally, with D moved, the key could slide right and eventually exit.\n\nThus, the very next move is to move block C left.\n\nAnswer: C left","Based on the position of the pieces, the vertical block D currently occupies column 6 in rows 2–4 and is blocking the red “key” (the two adjacent 1’s in row 3) from moving right. In a puzzle of this type (similar to “Unblock Me”), the red block must reach the exit at the right edge. To clear the path in row 3, we need to shift block D far enough so that the cell in row 3, column 6 becomes free. Although moving D one step up or down still leaves one of its squares touching row 3 in column 6, we can see that moving block D downward twice will eventually free row 3 column 6 (after D occupies rows 4–6, the row 3 cell becomes empty). \n\nAt the current epoch (epoch 19), our next move is to begin that process. We can move D down one step (from rows 2–4 to rows 3–5). This is a legal move since row 5, column 6 is empty. On subsequent turns (after epoch 19), we would move D down once more so the key can have a clear horizontal exit path. \n\nThus, the next move is:\nD down\n\nAnswer: D down","I'll start by analyzing the board. The key (represented by 1) occupies row 3, columns 4–5 and can only move horizontally. To have the key exit on the right side, the cell immediately to its right (row 3, column 6) must be free.

In puzzles of this kind (similar to “Unblock Me”), the key must exit off the board from the right edge. Since the key is already in row3 and touching the right edge (col6), the winning move is to slide the key to the right—effectively moving it into the exit.\n\nThus, on this turn (epoch 90), the best move is to move the key right by one step.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","The key (“1”) is currently placed horizontally in row 2 (occupying columns 4 and 5).

The key (the two “1” cells, currently at row 3, columns 1–2) must travel right toward the exit at row 3, column 6. However, the vertical block A (occupying row 1–3, column 5) blocks the key’s path. Because A is vertical it may only move vertically—but its downward option is blocked by row 4, column 5 (currently occupied by horizontal block E which spans row 4, columns 3–5). Notice that horizontal block E can only move horizontally. Checking row 4, we see that cell (row 4, column 2) is empty; so if we move E left by one step the cells occupied by E would become row 4, columns 2–4. That move would free row 4, column 5. Once row 4, column 5 is free, block A will be able to move down, clearing the key’s route to the exit. \n\nThus, the best move in epoch 1 is to reposition block E. \n\nAnswer: E left","I'll move the key (piece \"1\") one step to the right.

Notice the vertical block A occupies col5 in rows1–3. For the key to reach the exit its rightward journey must eventually allow it to step into col6. In a horizontal move, the key would occupy two consecutive cells; to have its rightmost cell be the exit at col6, it must eventually occupy cells in row3 col5–6. That means cell row3 col5 must be empty. As long as A keeps covering col5—including after one move down (which would shift A from rows1–3 to rows2–4, still blocking row3 col5)—we must eventually reposition A further downward by three steps, but we see obstacles (like block B on row5 col5) that would need a chain of moves on D, E, F, and B. Since it is turn 3 and we are allowed one move per turn, it is best to start with a simple advancing move.\n\nRight now the key’s immediate right neighbor (row3 col4) is 0 (an empty space). So the simplest step is to move the key to the right. This moves the key from row3 col2–3 to row3 col3–4. Although further manipulation will be needed (for example eventually repositioning A and B so that row3 col5 is freed), the first move should be to advance the key.\n\nThus I choose the move: move the key (\"1\") one step to the right.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","Based on the board configuration, the path for the key (the two “1” cells in row 3) to eventually reach the exit (the “2” at row 3, column 6) is blocked by the vertical A block that occupies row1–3, column5. Since A can only be moved vertically, we must clear its roadway by eventually shifting it downward. However, to move A down more than one step (which is needed so that its top clears row3), the cell immediately below its bottom piece (currently at row3, column5) must be available. Moving A down one step would put it in positions (2,5), (3,5) and (4,5) – still blocking row3, column5. To move A down a second step, (row5, column5) must be free. But row5, column5 is currently occupied by the horizontal block B.  \n \nSince horizontal blocks (like B) can only move horizontally, we can shift B to the right (provided row5, column6 is free) in order to free row5, column5. In row 5 the cells are: D at (5,1), then 0, then F, then B and B, and finally 0 at (5,6). Moving B right is valid because (5,6) is empty. This move will allow us in a future turn to move A downward enough steps so that when the key moves right it won’t be obstructed.  \n \nThus, at the current epoch (epoch 4), the best move is to move block B right.  \n \nAnswer: B right","I analyzed the board and possibilities. The key is in row 3 (occupying columns 3–4) and its direct right neighbor (row 3, column 5) is blocked by block A (which, being vertical, occupies row 1–3 in column 5). Although moving A down one step only shifts its positions to row 2–4, it is the only valid immediate move that may eventually allow us to free the key’s path toward the exit (2) at row 3, column 6. (Other moves don’t clear the essential blockage.) \n\nThus, at the current epoch the best move is to slide block A downward by one step.\n\nAnswer: A down","I'll start by “opening up” the puzzle. (Note: There are several pieces whose motions interact in “multi‐move” sequences; here I must choose one legal, promising move at the current epoch.)\n\nLooking at the board at epoch 6:\n\n Row1: 0 C C C 0 0 \n Row2: 0 0 0 0 A 0 \n Row3: 0 0 1 1 A 2 \n Row4: D E E E A 0 \n Row5: D 0 F 0 B B \n Row6: D 0 F 0 0 0 \n\nThe “key” (cells with “1”) is in row 3 at columns 3–4. Its exit “2” is at row3 column6 but block A (vertical) occupies col 5 in rows2–4. To free the key’s path we eventually need to shift A downward two steps – but its downward move is blocked by block B on row5. To eventually rearrange that and free room for A, it looks necessary to begin “unblocking” the left side so that other pieces (like D and E, and ultimately F and B) can reposition.\n\nA good initial move is to “lift” block D. (Block D is vertical in the left‐column, and moving it upward will eventually free room to allow repositioning of E and later F so that B can shift left and then A can finally drop far enough. In puzzles of this type the first “shuffling” move is often to move the block on the far left upward.)\n\nThus at epoch 6 a valid and promising move is to shift block D up. \n\nAnswer: D up","I'll start by making a preparatory move. Notice that block A (which is vertical in col 5, occupying rows 2–4) is blocking the key’s path to the exit at row3 col6. In order to eventually free row3 col5, block A must eventually move down by two steps (so it no longer covers row3). However, block A can only move vertically and it can move down only if row5 col5 is free. At present, block B (a horizontal block in row5, occupying cols5–6) prevents this.\n\nA useful step to eventually clear a route is to free up some space on the left edge so that other blocks (like E and F) might be repositioned later. For that reason I will start by moving the vertical block D, which currently occupies row3–5 in col 1. Moving D upward makes room in row5 and will later allow repositioning of adjacent blocks so that F (blocking B’s leftward movement) can move. \n\nThus, for the current epoch (7) I choose to move block D upward one step.\n\nAnswer: D up","I'll start by taking an initial move. In our current position the red “key” (the double 1 in row 3, columns 3–4) is blocked from its final rightward slide by block A (which occupies col 5 in row 3). (Remember block A is vertical; it always slides only up or down.) One standard strategy in this kind of sliding‐puzzle (a “Rush Hour”–style problem) is to begin “unwinding” the other blocks so that we can eventually clear a path for A to leave row 3. In our board many moves are needed – for example, one plan is to eventually move block A down (so it occupies rows 4–6 and thus frees row 3) but to move A down you must first clear block B from row 5 (which in turn means shifting block B far enough left – and to do that you may have to move block F as well, after shifting block D and block E). \n\nA common first step is to temporarily shift the key left so that it is not “in the way” when we later need to move the blocking pieces upward. (Recall the key can move only horizontally.) \n\nThus, an excellent opening move is to move the key one step to the left. \n\nAnswer: 1 left","I'll choose to move the key one step to the right. Right now the key (represented by 1, occupying row3 columns2–3) has an open cell (row3, col4). Although the next move may require additional adjustments for the block labeled A (which currently occupies row2–4, col5) so that eventually the key can reach the exit (at row3, col6), moving the key right from its start is a legal and helpful move. \n\nAnswer: 1 right","I'll choose to initiate the plan by moving the key left one step. This may look counter‐intuitive since our target is at the right, but we first need to “unlock” some space on the board so that later we can clear Block A from row 3. (In a longer plan we’d eventually move other blocks – like shifting E and F to allow two left moves of Block B so that A can then be moved far enough down – but at epoch 10 the best “opening” move is to start by moving the key left.) \n\nThus, my move for epoch 10 is:\n  Move the key (1) left.\n\nAnswer: 1 left","Looking at the board, the key (two “1” cells in row 3, columns 2–3) still has an open cell immediately to its right (row 3, column 4). Although the exit (the “2” at row 3, column 6) isn’t immediately reachable because block A (in column 5) blocks its way, the key can start by moving right. (Later moves would require shifting block A—but for this turn the simplest legal move is to start by moving the key one step to the right.)\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1 right","I'll start by making a move that is legal and can help begin to clear the key’s path. Notice that the key “1” (which sits on row2, columns2–3) cannot move right yet because block A occupies column4 in row2. Since A is a vertical block it can only move vertically. One promising idea is to move A upward because that move is allowed if the cell above it is free. At the start, A occupies row1–3 in column4. Moving A up one step is legal because row0, column4 is free. (After that move A will be in rows0–2 with column4 – although row2 is still occupied, it gives us more room later to eventually try moving A down twice in order to fully clear row2.) \n\nThus, at epoch 12 a valid move is to move block A upward.\n\nAnswer: A up","Let's analyze the board (using 0‐indexed rows):\n\n• Row0: 0 C C C A 0  \n• Row1: D 0 0 0 A 0  \n• Row2: D 0 1 1 A 2  \n• Row3: D E E E 0 0  \n• Row4: 0 0 F 0 B B  \n• Row5: 0 0 F 0 0 0  \n\nHere the key (\"1\") is the red car and is horizontal in row2 (occupying columns 2 and 3) and its exit (\"2\") is at row2, column 5. The vertical block A (occupying column 4 in rows 0–2) is blocking the key’s path. In order for the red car to move to the right—even eventually after several moves—the blocking car A must be moved down far enough so it no longer occupies row2, column4. However, A can only shift vertically, and its second downward move (which would be needed to clear row2) is blocked because its destination cell at row4, column4 is occupied by block B.\n\nSince block B is horizontal (occupying row4, columns 4 and 5) and can only move horizontally, we must clear its way first. By moving B left by one step we free the cell at row4, column4. This then lets A move down on subsequent turns (by two more moves, eventually three down in total) to clear row2 completely, allowing the key to slide right to exit.\n\nThus, at epoch 13 the best next move is to move block B one step to the left.\n\nAnswer: B left","My plan is to start by moving the vertical block A one step downward. At the moment, block A occupies cells (0,4), (1,4), and (2,4) in column 4. It currently blocks the key (which is a horizontal piece at row 2, columns 2–3) from moving right since the exit at cell (2,5) cannot be reached until the blocking piece is repositioned. As A is vertical it can only move up or down, and it cannot move up because its top is already at row 0. Moving A down by one step shifts its cells to (1,4), (2,4), and (3,4), beginning the process of opening a path for the key towards the exit.\n\nAnswer: A down","We can “think‐ahead” to clear the way for the key. Notice that the key (“1”) sits on row 3 in columns 3–4 and the exit (“2”) is at row 3, column 6. The vertical block “A” occupies column 5 in rows 2–4 and blocks the key from moving right. (Remember, the key can move only horizontally.) In order to completely clear row 3, block “A” must vacate row 3. Since “A” is vertical it may be moved only up or down. Its only chance to avoid row 3 is to be shifted down two steps (so it then occupies rows 4–6), but to move “A” down one step the cell below its bottom must be free. Initially the cell row 5, column 5 is taken by the horizontal block “B” (which spans row 5, columns 4–5). In turn, “B” can move only horizontally. Its leftward move would require free cell row 5, column 3, but that cell is held by the vertical block “F.” (The other possibility, moving “B” right, would still keep a block in column 5.) In order to eventually free the space to let “B” shift, we must first “clear a lane” for F by moving the E‐tile (the horizontal block “E” on row 4) out of the way – and that, in turn, is possible only if “A” no longer occupies row 4, column 5. \n\nA short‐term “pivot” is to move “A” upward. Although an upward move keeps “A” in row 3, it now places its block on rows 1–3 instead of rows 2–4. This “A up” move immediately frees cell row 4, column 5, so that E can later slide right, eventually freeing room for F to move and then eventually “B” can shift to free row 5, column 5. Only then can “A” be moved downward (twice) to get it completely out of the key’s row. Once row 3 is clear, the key can slide right along row 3 until it reaches the exit.\n\nA good first move is therefore to “lift” A upward (that is, perform the move “A up”). \n\nAnswer: A up","The main obstacle for the key (shown as “1”) to move right into the exit (“2”) is the vertical block A occupying column 4 in row 2. Since the key can only move horizontally, we need to clear its right‐path by repositioning block A. Because A is vertical it can only move vertically; it can’t move up (its top would go off‐board) so we plan to shift it downward. However, to move A down a second time (which is needed so that its cell in row2 col4 is freed when the key moves right), we must clear row4 col4. Currently, block B (a horizontal block in row4 at columns 3 and 4) is in the way. And to shift B left (its only way to vacate col4) its left cell (row4 col2) must be free—but block F (a vertical block in col2 at rows 4 and 5) is there. \n\nThe plan is to “unlock” the cascade: first, we can shift block E (a horizontal block in row3, initially at columns 1–3) to the right not just once but eventually twice. Moving E right twice will clear row3 col2 so that F can then move upward—freeing row4 col2 and allowing B to slide left. Once B is out of the way, A can move down again and the key path becomes open.\n\nAt the current epoch (16) a good move is to begin by moving E to the right. This initiates the necessary chain reaction. \n\nAnswer: E right","I'll start by analyzing the board. In the printed board, one clear “bottleneck” is the vertical block A located at column 5 in rows 1–3; it prevents the key (the two “1”s in row 3) from moving right into the exit (“2” at row 3, column 6). In order for the key, which only moves horizontally, to eventually slide from its original columns (3–4) to the exit column (6) on its row, we must “shift” block A so that row 3, column 5 becomes free. (Remember that vertical blocks like A can only move vertically.) \n\nTo eventually “clear” row 3 from A’s interference, we can try to move A entirely out of row 3 – for example, shifting it downward enough so that it no longer occupies row 3. However, A’s downward motion is blocked because the cell immediately below its bottom (row 4, column 5) is occupied by the horizontal block E (which sits in row 4, columns 3–5). \n\nSo the first step is to free up row 4, column 5. Because E is horizontal and can only move left\/right, we can move it left (so that it slides away from column 5). After that one move, the cell row 4, column 5 becomes empty, leaving room for A, which then can be moved down in subsequent steps. (Later one would also think about B which blocks row 5, column 5—but at epoch 17 a good first move is to start by liberating row 4, col 5.)\n\nThus, for epoch 17 the best move is to move block E one step left.\n\nAnswer: E left","I analyzed the board and determined that we must start “unblocking” the routes needed for eventual key movement. The key’s path to the exit at the right (on row 3) is blocked by block A (which is vertical, occupying row 1–3 in column 5). To eventually make space for A to be shifted downward so the key can slide right, we must first free up room for other blocks that impede that maneuver. In this case, moving the vertical block D upward (from row 2–4 to row 1–3 in column 1) opens space in row 4 that will let us later maneuver blocks E, F, and B to clear the way for A’s full downward translation.\n\nThus, the best first move is to slide block D upward.\n\nAnswer: D up","Below is one valid plan to eventually deliver the key (the “1” block) into the exit (the “2” cell):\n\nStep by step, one possible solution is to “clear a path” on row 3 as follows. Notice that the key is horizontal and sits in row 3 at columns 3–4, but its way to the exit in column 6 is blocked by the vertical block A (at column 5). In order to move A out of the way, A must “slide down” so that eventually it occupies rows 4–6 rather than rows 1–3. However, A cannot go down a second time unless row 5, column 5 is free – and that cell is currently occupied by block B (a horizontal block in row 5 at columns 4–5). To let B move, we see that for B to slide left (its only possible horizontal move that would free column 5), its left‐neighbor cell (row 5, column 3) must be empty. (Block F, a vertical block at column 3 in rows 5–6, is there.)\n\nOne strategy is as follows:\n1. First, clear the left part of row 3 so that block F (which can only move vertically) can be shifted upward twice. (That upward double move will “lift” F out of row 5 and free the cell row 5, col 3 so that block B can move left.)  \n • Since the key (“1”) occupies row 3 columns 3–4 (blocking where F would move into if it goes up two steps), we must move it temporarily to the left.  \n • But row 3, column 1 is initially occupied by block D (a vertical block). Therefore, we first move block D down three steps (one move per turn) so that row 3’s left cell is freed.\n\n2. Then, move the key two steps left so that its former cell in col 3 is freed.  \n3. Now move F upward twice, freeing row 5, column 3.\n4. Then slide block B left one step (now it will occupy row 5 columns 3–4, and thereby free row 5, column 5).\n5. With row 5, column 5 free, move block A down three times so that it “escapes” row 3 (ending in rows 4–6). With A no longer interfering row 3 col 5, the key finally has a clear horizontal track.\n6. Finally, move the key to the right repeatedly (one move per turn) until its right end reaches the exit (cell “2”) at row 3, column 6.\n\nSince the current epoch is 19 and you’re to produce one move per turn, the very first move in this planned sequence is to begin by moving D downward (to eventually free row 3’s leftmost cell).\n\nThus, the move at epoch 19 is:\n\nD down\n\nAnswer: D down","I will start by taking a move aimed at opening the red‐car’s path. Notice that the red key (represented by 1) lies in row 3 and needs to go right, but its way is blocked by the vertical car “A” (in col 5).

(In the well‐known Rush Hour puzzle the red “car” must exit on the right; here the “key” is our red car and its exit “2” is on the far right.) \n\nOne promising idea is to start relocating the vertical blocker “A” downward.

Notice that the key (represented by 1) is in row 2 (columns 2–3) and its rightward path to the exit (at row 2, column 5) is blocked by block A which occupies column 4 (in rows 1–3). To eventually slide the key to the exit, we must eventually move A so that row 2, column 4 becomes empty. However, block A cannot move immediately because its only legal moves are vertically and its downward move is blocked on row 4 (column 4) by block B. In order to free up room so that block B can later be shifted (so that A may move down two steps), we first need to free movement for some blocks that are indirectly holding things up.\n\nLooking at the board, block E (in row 3) and block F (in row 4–5) are in a deadlock: for example, B (in row 4) cannot move left because F is in the way, and F cannot move up because row 3 is occupied by E. But block E is currently squeezed on its left by block D (a vertical block in column 0 spanning rows 1–3). If we “give D some room” by moving it down one, then row 3, column 0 (currently occupied by D) will become free. That frees up the possibility for E to shift left later, which in turn will allow F to later move upward, so that B can finally be moved left. Once B clears the spot at row 4, column 4, block A will then have the opportunity to move down twice – ultimately clearing row 2, column 4 for the key to slide right into the exit.\n\nTherefore, as our first move at epoch 21, I choose to move block D down.\n\nAnswer: D down","I’ll start by moving block A upward. (Since A is a vertical block currently blocking the key’s path in row 3, shifting it upward begins “releasing” room for the key. Though further moves will be needed later, at this epoch the next step is to issue “A up.”)\n\nAnswer: A up","I'll start by making an initial legal move. Looking at the board, block A (which is vertical, currently at cells (1,5), (2,5) and (3,5)) is immediately in the way of the key (cells (3,3) and (3,4)) reaching the exit at (3,6). One valid plan is to eventually shift block A downward so that it no longer occupies row 3. (A vertical block moved down three times—from rows 1–3 to rows 4–6—will free row 3 even though intermediate moves still keep part of it on row 3.) In order to eventually move A all the way down, we’ll have to free up the cell below its bottom piece each move. Right now, the first move is simple: A’s bottom is at (3,5) and the cell below at (4,5) is free. \n\nThus, for our current move (epoch 23) a legal step is to move block A down one step.\n\nAnswer: A down","I analyzed the board and determined that the key’s immediate problem is the vertical “A” blocking its right‐exit path (the exit “2” is at row3, col6). To eventually “clear” row3 col5 the A block must be moved fully out of row3. (Because the key moves only horizontally, its only unobstructed path to the exit is on row3.) The only way to “shift” A away from row3 is to send it downward two steps so that it occupies rows 4–6 instead of rows 2–4. However, A cannot move down unless the cell at row5, col5 is freed. That cell is part of the horizontal block “B” (located at row5, col4–5). To move B left so it no longer occupies col5, we must free row5 col3. But that cell is occupied by block “F” (a vertical block in rows5–6, col3). And since vertical blocks can move only vertically, our only way to shift F out of row5 is to move it upward two steps. (After two upward moves F would then occupy rows 3–4, leaving row5 col3 free for B to shift left.) Unfortunately, F would then conflict with the key (currently in row3, occupying col3–4) unless we first reposition the key. Because the key also is only allowed horizontal motion, the only “detour” is to move it left so that its cells are not in F’s destination. But since block “D” is in row3, col1 (part of a vertical column D that spans row3–5), we first need to “clear” the left side by moving D down one step (D can only move vertically). This “D down” move frees row3 col1 so that in subsequent turns the key can move left, then F can move upward twice, and then B can slide left. With B out of the way the vertical block A can finally move down twice, clearing row3 so that the key (which moves only horizontally) can take the final steps to the exit.\n\nThus, as the very first move in our plan we should “open up” the left by moving D down one.\n\nAnswer: D down","Below is one valid winning solution. In our solution we gradually “unblock” the way so that the key (piece “1”) – which only moves horizontally – may eventually slide into the exit (the “2” at the far‐right of row 3). (Note: Blocks labeled with letters can only move in their “own” direction—horizontal ones only left\/right and vertical ones only up\/down.)\n\nHere is one possible move‐sequence (each “Answer:” line specifies the piece and the direction of its single‐step move):\n\n1. Move block A upward – this shifts A (which was vertical in column 5) so that its lowest square leaves row 4.\n  Command: A up\n2. Move block E right – now the horizontal block E (in row 4) slides right one so that later F can be moved.\n  Command: E right\n3.

Move the key left a second time – now the key occupies row 3, columns 1–2 so that its “shadowed” column 3 is empty.\n  Command: 1 left\n6.

This clears cell (row 5, col 5), which is needed for A’s descent.\n  Command: B left\n9. Move block A down – A (vertical in column 5) shifts from (rows 1–3) down to rows 2–4.\n  Command: A down\n10. Move block A down again – now A occupies rows 3–5.\n  Command: A down\n11. Move block A down a third time – then A ends in rows 4–6, fully clearing row 3.\n  Command: A down\n12.

Move the key right once more – key now slides to columns 4–5.\n  Command: 1 right\n16. Finally, move the key right – with this move the key (occupying columns 5–6) touches the exit (the “2” is at row 3, column 6).\n  Command: 1 right\n\nEvery move respects the allowed directions. After the final move the key reaches the exit on the right side. \n\nAnswer: 1 right","I'll choose to move the key one step to the left. On the current board the left cell next to the key is free, so moving the key left is a legal move that begins making room for later repositioning of the vertical A block (which eventually must be shifted down enough so that the key’s path to the exit at the board’s right side is open).\n\nAnswer: 1 left","I'll start with my move decision. Looking at the board at epoch 27, the key (“1”) is on row 3 at columns 2–3 and must slide horizontally to eventually exit from the right (cell with “2” at row 3, column 6). Although several blocks (A, B, C, D, E, F) clutter the board and later moves will be needed to create a full path, the very first legal move is to slide the key one step to the right (from columns 2–3 to columns 3–4) because the cell at (row 3, column 4) is empty. \n\nThus, my immediate move is to instruct the key “1” to move right.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","I'll start by “unlocking” the blocked sequence. Notice that the key (1) is at row 3 (cells (2,2) and (2,3)) and needs to go right toward the exit (2) at (2,5). Currently the vertical block A occupies column 4 (at (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)) and blocks the key’s way. To eventually free row 2 col 4 for the key, block A must be moved down. But A can only move vertically and its downward move is blocked by block B (which covers row 5, col 3–4). B is horizontal and can only move sideways. Unfortunately, B cannot move left immediately because its left cell (row 5, col 2) is occupied by block F. F (a vertical block at (5,3)? Actually, F covers row 5 col 3? – check: F is at row 5 col ? Let’s re‐examine the board: \n\nThe board is:\n Row0: 0  C  C  C  0  0  \n Row1: 0  0  0  0  A  0  \n Row2: 0  0  1  1  A  2  \n Row3: D  E  E  E  A  0  \n Row4: D  0  F  B  B  0  \n Row5: D  0  F  0  0  0  \n\nHere the letters are placed as follows:\n– Block C: row0, cols1–3 (horizontal).\n– Block A: col4, rows1–3 (vertical).\n– Block D: col0, rows3–5 (vertical).\n– Block E: row3, cols1–3 (horizontal).\n– Block F: col2, rows4–5 (vertical).\n– Block B: row4, cols3–4 (horizontal).\n\nFor B to clear room for A to move down, F (to its left) must be repositioned. F can only move vertically. It cannot move down because row6 is off‐board; however, F can move up if its top cell’s upward neighbor is free. That cell is at row2, col2 but it is blocked by E (which is horizontal in row3, cols1–3). E in turn is blocked on the left by D (located in row3, col0). \n\nSo the first step is to clear that chain: move D upward so that row3, col0 becomes free. With D (a vertical block) moving up one step, its new positions become rows2–4, col0, freeing row3, col0. This then will allow E (horizontal) to later shift left, then F (vertical) can later move upward, allowing B (horizontal) to be moved left. Later, with B out of the way, block A can be moved down to free row2, col4 for the key to slide right toward the exit.\n\nThus, at the current epoch (28) the first best move is to move block D up.\n\nAnswer: D up","After analyzing the Rush‐Hour–like situation on the board, one of the critical early moves is to “free up” extra space for maneuvering the vehicles so that eventually the vertical vehicle A (which is currently blocking the red “key” from going right) can be fully shifted out of row 3. In our case a good preliminary move is to slide the vertical block D one step downward. This move does not directly clear the key’s path, but it begins to create the extra room needed so that later the obstructing block A (and even the horizontal block B that indirectly blocks A’s downward movement) can be adjusted. (In many puzzles of this type, repositioning D is the “first move” that eventually leads to clearing the path for the key to escape out the right-hand border.)\n\nAnswer: D down","I’ll start by taking a “pre‐movement” step so that later moves can eventually clear a path for the key. Reviewing the board, moving the key right immediately is blocked by block A at row2 col4. In order eventually to free row2 col4 (by later shifting A down), we must first “make room” elsewhere. For example, block B (in row4) must later move away so that A can slide down, but B itself is “packed” against F and D. A good preparatory step is to “shift” block D upward (D is vertical in column0, occupying rows3–5) so that in later moves the block E (which currently blocks movement from the left side of row3) can be adjusted. (Concretely, after moving D up, further moves – for instance moving E later – should eventually free up the space needed to allow F (and then B) to shift, so that A can be moved downward and then clear the path to let the key proceed right.) \n\nThus, the very next legal move is to move block D upward.\n\nAnswer: D up","It appears that the only move that makes any progress toward eventually freeing the key’s path is to start by shifting the block B. (B is a horizontal block on row4; moving it right makes room for the vertical block A eventually to drop out of row2.) \n\nThus, I choose to move B right. \n\nAnswer: B right","I'll start by analyzing the configuration. We have a 6×6 board (rows 1–6, columns 1–6) with the following pieces:\n\n• Block C is found in row1 at columns2–4. Being in one row, it is horizontal.\n• Block A occupies row2 col5, row3 col5, and row4 col5. That is a vertical block.\n• Block D occupies row3 col1, row4 col1, and row5 col1 (vertical).\n• Block E occupies row4 at columns2–4 (horizontal).\n• Block F occupies row5 col3 and row6 col3 (vertical).\n• Block B occupies row5 at columns5–6 (horizontal).\n• The key (labeled “1”) occupies row3 at columns3–4 (horizontal) and can only move horizontally.\n• The exit (labeled “2”) sits in row3 at col6.\n\nTo win, we need to eventually clear the way so that the key in row3, which currently has block A in its way (at row3 col5), can move to the right and exit via col6.\n\nOne strategy is to eventually “move down” block A so that it no longer blocks row3 col5. However, A can only move vertically. Notice that if we move A down by two steps, it would then occupy rows4–6 in col5 leaving row3 col5 free. Unfortunately, in its current configuration A cannot move down because row5 col5 is occupied by block B.\n\nBecause B is horizontal, its only possible moves are left or right. Since moving B to the right isn’t possible (it is already at the board’s right edge), the idea is to start repositioning B by moving it left. After one left move, B (of size 2) will shift from occupying row5 col5–6 to occupying row5 col4–5. (Subsequently, further moves – along with adjustments of other blocks – can free row5 col5 so that A can be moved down.)\n\nThus, a good first move toward eventually getting A out of the key’s path is to move block B left.\n\nAnswer: B left","I’ve been studying the board and thinking about our “exit‐clearing puzzle.” A quick look shows that the key (the two “1”s in row 3, columns 3–4) should eventually slide to the right so its right cell reaches the exit (“2” at row 3, column 6). Unfortunately the vertical block A (which currently occupies row 2, row 3 and row 4 in column 5) is directly in its path. Since vertical blocks may only move vertically, and a one‐step move upward is available (the space in row 1, column 5 is empty) while a downward move is blocked by the piece B in row 5 (and further shifting other blocks is needed before A can be brought completely out of row 3), the most immediate legal (and preparatory) move is to “slide A up” by one cell. This sets the stage for later moves (for example, after rearranging the obstructing horizontal blocks) so that eventually A can be shifted far enough down to clear row 3 for the key. \n\nThus my move at this epoch is:\n\nA up\n\nAnswer: A up","I'll begin by moving the vertical key‐block A down—this is the first step toward freeing row 3’s exit path. (That is, A will careen downward so that eventually it stops blocking the key from moving right to exit.) \n\nAnswer: A down","I’m choosing to begin by shifting one of the “obstructing” blocks. Notice that the key (the two “1” cells on row 3) can only go right but its way is blocked by the vertical “A” that sits in column 5 (covering rows 2–4 when numbering rows from the top as 1–6). In order to later shift “A” downward (so that the key’s row is freed) we must first “clear” the cell in row 5 (the destination for “A” upon a downward move). (In the present configuration the horizontal block “B” in row 5 (columns 4–5) is preventing “A” from shifting down.) \n\nA good first move is to reposition “B.” Because “B” is horizontal and can only slide left–right, we have a chance to “relocate” it by moving it right.

Notice that the key “1” is on row 2 (cells 2–3) and its right neighbor (cell [2,4]) is occupied by the A‐block. To free column 4 on row 2 we must eventually “shift” A completely off row 2 by moving it down twice so that it will occupy rows 3–5. But A (a vertical block in column 4) can only move vertical. Unfortunately, its downward move is prevented by the block “B” on row 4 (B occupies row 4, columns 4–5). Since B is a horizontal block it can move horizontally. Although one left–shift of B moves it from columns 4–5 to columns 3–4, that still leaves B in column 4. Therefore we need to start by moving B left so that after additional moves (and after dealing with other blocks that might interfere) we can eventually clear B away from column 4. \n\nThus, for this epoch (epoch 36) I choose the first strategic move:\n\nB left\n\nAnswer: B left","I analyzed the board and noticed that the key (two “1”s on row 3 in columns 3–4) is currently blocked from reaching the exit (the “2” in row 3, column 6) by the vertical block A, which spans row 2–4 in column 5. One way to eventually free the path for the key is to “reposition” block A so that it can later slide further down (by two moves) leaving row 3 completely free. However, A cannot move down immediately because its move would be blocked by block B (occupying row 5, columns 4–5). In our planned sequence the first step is therefore to move A upward (which is allowed since the cell above row 2, column 5 is empty). Although moving A up still leaves row 3, column 5 occupied by the moved piece, it sets up later moves (for example, shifting other blocks to move block B, then moving A down twice) so that eventually the key can slide right into the exit. \n\nThus, at this epoch (37), the best move is to issue the command: \n\nA up\n\nAnswer: A up","Here is my reasoning. One promising strategy is to eventually “lift” block A (which runs vertically in column 5) completely out of row 3 so that the key (which occupies row 3, columns 3–4 and can only move horizontally) can head safely to the exit at (3,6). In order for block A (a vertical block occupying three consecutive rows) to leave row 3 it must be repositioned entirely into either the upper or lowercase part of the board. (Because A’s cells always span consecutive rows, if it’s in rows 1–3 or 2–4 or 3–5 then row 3 remains covered; the only chance is to get it into rows 4–6.) Unfortunately A’s “landing spot” in row 5 is blocked at the start by the horizontal block B (occupying row 5, columns 4–5). In order to eventually clear A’s landing cells, one promising idea is to begin by “freeing space” on the lower part of the board. For that, we can try to move one of the blocks that interfere with relocating B or the blocks that block F (the vertical block in column 3) from interfering. (Recall that F, as a vertical block, can only move vertically; if F remains in row 5 then B cannot slide left.)\nOne promising first move is to start “opening up” row 4 by moving block E (which is horizontal and currently occupies row 4, columns 2–4) so that the above‐and‐below cells can later be used to reposition F and then B. For example, if we make the move “E right” the E–piece will shift its cells to row 4, columns 3–5. (This move is legal since the cell at (4,5) is empty.) Later moves in the solution might include pushing D upward, moving the key laterally to allow F to get “out of the way” of B, and eventually shifting A down so that row 3 is cleared for the key’s passage.\nFor now (epoch 38) it is a good idea to make a preparatory move by moving block E to the right.\n\nAnswer: E right","Analyzing the current board, we see that the key (the two adjacent “1” tiles in row 3, columns 3–4) needs to move right to eventually reach the exit “2” at row 3, column 6. However, the vertical block A occupies row 3, column 5 – right in the key’s path. Because vertical blocks can only move vertically and A cannot move upward (there’s no free cell above row 1), its only possibility is to shift downward. Unfortunately, row 4, column 5 is initially occupied by the horizontal block E (which fills row 4, columns 3–5).\n\nTo clear room for A to move down (which eventually could allow it to leave row 3 empty so the key can slide right), we first need to free up row 4, column 5. The horizontal block E can only slide left or right. Moving E right would still keep one of its tiles in column 5, but moving E left shifts its whole body to occupy row 4, columns 2–4 – leaving column 5 free. (It is valid because row 4, column 2 is empty.) \n\nTherefore, the best immediate move at this epoch is to slide block E one step left.\n\nAnswer: E left","I see that the key (represented by “1”) on row 2 currently occupies cells (2,2) and (2,3) and must eventually travel horizontally to the exit at cell (2,5).

Since the key can only move horizontally and its way right is blocked by A (at cell (2,4)), we must clear that spot.\n\nBecause block A is vertical it only moves up or down. Moving A up isn’t possible (its top is already at the top edge), so the only option is to move it downward. Shifting A down by one step moves it into positions (1,4), (2,4), and (3,4). That still leaves cell (2,4) occupied. However, moving it a total of three times downward will eventually remove A from row 2, clearing the key’s path. At this current epoch, the first necessary move is to begin shifting A downward.\n\nThus, my move is to move block A down (one step).\n\nAnswer: A down","I’ve analyzed the board. The key (consisting of two horizontal “1”s at row 3, columns 3‐4) must reach the exit at row 3, column 6. However, its path is blocked by the vertical A‐block (occupying row 2,3,4 at column 5). Because the key can only move horizontally, we must reposition block A so that row 3 becomes free for the key’s progress. (Note that if A moves one step in either vertical direction, its “middle” cell stays in row 3, meaning the key’s path remains obstructed.) In order to clear row 3, block A must be moved at least two steps. Unfortunately, A cannot move down right away because block B (a horizontal block on row 5, columns 4–5) prevents that route. The only immediate option is therefore to shift A upward one step. Although that move will still place one of its parts in row 3 in this epoch, it sets up for an eventual second upward move (in a future epoch) that will remove A entirely from row 3 and allow the key to move right toward the exit.\n\nSo my recommended move now is to move block A upward by one step.\n\nAnswer: A up","I analyze the board. Notice that the key (marked “1” and occupying row 3, columns 3–4) must eventually travel horizontally to exit at “2” (row 3, column 6). However, the cell immediately to the right of the key (row 3, column 5) is occupied by block A. Block A is vertical (it appears in row 1, row 2, and row 3 of column 5) and thus may be moved only vertically. (A cannot be moved upward because its top is already at the board’s edge, so the only option is downward.) Although moving A down one step will still have one cell in row 3, this move is a necessary first step – it will eventually allow us (after handling any other obstacles) to keep shifting A further downward so that row 3 becomes free for the horizontal key to continue to the exit.\n\nSo, as the move for the current turn (epoch 42), I will move block A one step down.\n\nAnswer: A down","I analyzed the board. Notice that the key (1) currently occupies (row2, col2–col3) and the exit (2) is at (row2, col5). However, block A (a vertical block occupying (row1, col4), (row2, col4), (row3, col4)) currently prevents the key from progressing right. One strategy is to eventually clear row2 col4 by moving A downward twice. (Moving A downward by one step isn’t enough because it would then still block row2; only after two downward moves would A occupy rows (3,4), (4,4), and (5,4), leaving row2 clear.) But before A can move downward, block B (a horizontal block on row4 at columns 3 and 4) must be moved out of the way. (B can only move horizontally.)  \n \nThus, in this epoch our first move is to move block B one step to the right. It will slide from occupying (4,3)–(4,4) to (4,4)–(4,5) because (4,5) is empty. This clears row4 col4 so that later block A can move downward.\n \nAnswer: B right","I'll start by explaining my reasoning briefly. On the board the key (represented by “1”) lies in row 3 (columns 3–4) and must exit at the cell with “2” in row 3, column 6.

In order to clear the way, we must eventually reposition “A” (it must be moved vertically) so that its middle cell no longer blocks row 3. To achieve that, “A” must be shifted downward two steps. But “A”’s first downward move is blocked by block “B”, which presently occupies row 5 columns 5–6. Since “B” is a horizontal block, the only way to clear row 5, column 5 is to shift “B” left so it doesn’t occupy that spot. (Note that moving “B” right isn’t possible because it would run off‐board.) Therefore, the immediate, logical move toward the eventual goal is to shift “B” to the left one step.

(In our notation, “1 right” means the key (1) is moved one step to the right.) \n\nOf course, a full solution would involve rearranging the other blocks in earlier moves so that row 3’s cell at column 5 is eventually cleared; once that cell is freed the key may move right until its right‐side touches the exit. In this epoch the “winning move” is to move the key right. \n\nAnswer: 1 right","I recommend moving block A upward. Although A is currently a vertical block in column 5 occupying rows 2–4 and blocking the key’s rightward path (its cell in row 3, column 5 prevents the key, which occupies row 3, columns 3–4, from moving right), shifting A upward is legal. When moved up one step, A will then occupy rows 1–3 in column 5. (Remember that a vertical block can only move vertically and can go up if the cell immediately above its top is free—in this case, row 1, column 5 is 0.) Although this move does not immediately allow the key to leave (its rightward cell still contains A), it is an essential step in a longer strategy. By moving block A upward, you begin a process that will eventually free row 3, column 5—after subsequent moves (perhaps after repositioning other blocks that are in the way) you can then shift A downward. This will clear the path for the key (which can only move horizontally) to move rightward toward the exit located at row 3, column 6.\n\nAnswer: A up","I'll choose to move block A down in order to eventually clear column‐5 on row 3 for the key. (By shifting the vertical block A down one step, we begin the process of “unlocking” row 3; later moves can clear the way for the key to move right into the exit.)\n\nAnswer: A down","Analyzing the board, the key (two adjacent “1” cells at row 3 columns 3–4) is blocked from moving right by the vertical block A in column 5. To eventually free cell (3,5) so that the key can slide right into the exit at (3,6), we must reposition A. Because A (occupying rows 2–4 in column 5) can only move vertically, its downward motion would require that (5,5) be empty. At row 5, block B (a horizontal piece at columns 4–5) is currently blocking (5,5). In order to eventually shift B, we’d like to clear row 5, column 3 (currently occupied by vertical block F whose upward motion is blocked by block E in row 4). Notably, block E (a horizontal block in row 4, columns 2–4) can move horizontally only if its path is clear. Moving E left would free row 4’s middle cell (needed for F to move up), but E cannot move left until row 4, column 1 is free. Presently, that cell is occupied by vertical block D (covering rows 3–5 in column 1). \n\nA good first step is to start shifting the chain: move D upward. Since D is vertical and its top cell (row 3, column 1) can go up into row 2, column 1 (which is empty), we can make the move “D up”. This begins to clear column 1 on row 4 so that later, block E can move left; then F may move up, B can shift left, A can move downward to clear the path for the key, and finally the key can move right toward the exit.\n\nAnswer: D up","Below is one complete solution sequence (a “plan‐of‐moves”) that clears the way for the key (marked “1”) to roll onto the exit (cell “2”) on the right. One valid plan is as follows. (Remember that horizontal pieces such as the key, C, E, and B may only shift left\/right while vertical pieces like D, A, and F may only slide up\/down.)\n\nIn our solution the idea is to “rescue” the situation by eventually shifting the vertical A‐block far enough downward so that it no longer occupies row 3 (where the key sits). But before doing that we must make room. In brief, our plan is to:\n • First “free up” the south cell below A by moving the B block away. (B is stuck unless the vertical F block – which occupies row 5 col 3 – is temporarily moved.)\n • To free F we shift the horizontal E block by moving D up (so that E has space to go right) and then move E right twice. These moves clear a column so that F can be nudged upward and then back down away from row 5 col 3.\n • Now with row 5 col 5 unblocked (B is shifted left) the A block is free to move down three times to relocate its three cells from rows 1–3 (after a preliminary “A up”) to rows 4–6 so that row 3 becomes open for the key.\n • Finally the key (which always moves horizontally) can take two right‐steps. Its final right move puts it so that its right half touches the exit.\n\nOne acceptable solution (each move is given in the format “X direction”) is:\n\n  1.

(Any sequence that ends with the key “1” sliding right onto exit is acceptable.)\n\nFor the final move as required, we report:\n\nAnswer: 1 right","I’ll make a preparatory move: slide D up. (By moving the vertical block D upward, you begin clearing space along the left side that will eventually allow you to shift the other blocks—E, F and then B—to free the path for later moving block A farther down. With a clear path, you can then finally move the key to the right and steer it to the exit.)\n\nAnswer: D up","Based on the board’s current configuration – with the key (two “1”s) at row 3, columns 3–4 and the exit “2” at row 3, column 6 – the immediate problem is that the vertical block A occupies row 3, column 5. (A covers three cells vertically; in its current position it spans rows 2–4 in column 5.) To eventually free row 3, column 5 so the key can slide right into the exit, we must “relocate” A off row 3. (Because A is vertical the only way to do that is to shift it completely down – by two moves – so that it occupies rows 4–6.) Unfortunately A cannot move downward until its “landing cell” is free; for its first down‐move the cell below its bottom must be opened. (Right now row 5, column 5 is blocked by the horizontal block B.) And block B cannot move left (even though that would free column 5) because its leftward neighbor (row 5, column 3) is taken by the vertical block F. In order to dislodge F we must “raise” it (vertical blocks move only vertically) – but F can only be moved upward if cell (row 4, column 3) is open. (Currently that cell is occupied by part of the horizontal block E.) Finally, F can be raised a second time only if row 3, column 3 is empty – yet the key is there!\n\nA “chain‐reaction” is needed. One very natural first move is to gently start “making room” so that eventually F can rise and B can shift left. To that end the key, which (though it must eventually exit to the right) can only move horizontally, should step aside to free row 3, column 3. (That will later allow F to move upward farther.) \n\nThus, the recommended move at this epoch is to move the key left (one step). \n\nAnswer: 1 left","Analyzing the board:\n• The key (represented by the two adjacent 1’s in row 3, columns 2–3) can only move horizontally.\n• Its current right neighbor in row 3, column 4 is empty.\n• Therefore, the key can safely shift right one cell, so that it moves from occupying columns 2–3 to occupying columns 3–4. This is a step toward reaching the exit at row 3, column 6.\n\nThus, the move is to move the key one step to the right.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","I analyzed the board and noticed that the key (the “1” piece) is in row 3 (occupying columns 3–4) and is blocked by the vertical A block at row 3, column 5, which in turn prevents the key from moving by its horizontal rule toward the exit (the “2” at row 3, column 6). To eventually free a clear horizontal path for the key, the A block must be repositioned so that it no longer occupies any part of row 3. Because A is vertical it can only move vertically; and to clear row 3 entirely it must be shifted downward—but an immediate downward move is blocked by B in row 5. Therefore, a preparatory move is needed. In this situation the simplest immediate action is to move the A block upward. Although this still leaves A in row 3 this “up” move frees up the space in row 4 (making row 4, column 5 available) so that later we can shift other blocks (B, F and E) as needed to eventually allow A to move downward fully (to rows 4–6) and clear row 3 entirely for the key.\n\nThus, the best next move is to move block A upward.\n\nAnswer: A up","I'll explain my reasoning briefly. In the initial board the key (two “1”s on row 3, columns 3–4) is blocked from reaching the exit (the “2” in row 3, column 6) by block A (a vertical block in column 5, rows 1–3). To eventually free the key’s path we must shift A far enough vertically so that no part of it occupies row 3. (A vertical block must remain in its column so the only way is to slide it down.) However, in order to move A down three steps (so that it occupies rows 4–6), the cell at row 5, column 5 must be empty. Unfortunately, block B (a horizontal block on row 5, columns 4–5) is in the way. To clear room for A, B must be moved left. But for B to move left its left‐cell (row 5, column 3) must be free – and row 5, column 3 is initially occupied by block F (a vertical block in column 3 on rows 5–6). Even though F can only move vertically, we can eventually free that cell by “raising” F out of the way; however, row 4, column 3 is initially blocked by block E (a horizontal block on row 4, columns 2–4). So our overall plan becomes to reposition some blocks first:\n • To create room for later moves, we first move block D (a vertical block in column 1 on rows 1–3) down so that it no longer “clogs” row 1 and helps eventually clear the key’s row.\n • Then (in subsequent epochs) we would move E right (twice) so that row 4, column 3 becomes free.\n • Next, we move F up (twice) so that row 5, column 3 is freed.\n • With that space, we can shift block B left to vacate row 5, column 5.\n • Now block A (which must move downward three times) can leave row 3 completely free.\n • Finally, the key can move right twice—first to begin its advance then into the exit.\nBecause we are at epoch 59 and must give a move now, the best first move is to shift D down.\n\nIn the required format the move is:\n\nAnswer: D down","I analyzed the board and noticed that the key “1” (occupying row 3, columns 3–4) needs a clear path to the exit “2” (at row 3, column 6). Right now, the vertical block A (occupying row 1–3, column 5) blocks the key from moving right. Since A is vertical it can only move vertically and—to free row 3 completely—it must be moved downward three times so that eventually it sits in rows 4–6 (thus no longer covering row 3). However, A’s downward moves require its destination cells to be empty. In particular, the second move (from rows 2–4 to rows 3–5) would need row 5, column 5 free. That cell is presently taken by block B (a horizontal block occupying row 5, columns 4–5). To clear room for A, we must eventually reposition B. But B can move only horizontally and, in order to shift B away from column 5 it seems best to shift it left – which would require cell row 5, column 3 to be clear. There F (a vertical block at row 5–6, column 3) interferes. To allow B to shift, F must be moved upward (its only vertical option), which in turn requires that row 4, column 3 (currently occupied by block E) be free.\n\nThus the earliest “opening move” is to begin clearing the way around E. Because E is horizontal and can only move sideways, if we move it right twice then its cells will become row 4, columns 4–6 – leaving row 4, column 3 unoccupied so that F can later be moved upward. (Other moves would not free row 4, column 3.) \n\nSince only one move is allowed per turn (and we are at epoch 60), the best next move is to start this cascading clearing by moving block E one step to the right.\n\nAnswer: E right","I’ll choose to reposition block E. By moving the horizontal block E one step to the left, we free up the square at row 4, column 5. This will later allow the vertical block A (which initially occupies rows 1–3 in column 5) to move down far enough (in a subsequent move sequence) so that it no longer blocks the key’s path. (Remember, after repositioning E to row 4, columns 2–4, the path for moving A down becomes clearer and ultimately opens the path for our key to move right and reach the exit.) \n\nThus, for this turn I will move block E left.\n\nAnswer: E left","I'll start by analyzing the board:\n\n• The board (with row and column indices starting at 0) is as follows:\n Row0: [0, C, C, C, A, 0]\n Row1: [D, 0, 0, 0, A, 0]\n Row2: [D, 0, 1, 1, A, 2]\n Row3: [D, E, E, E, 0, 0]\n Row4: [0, 0, F, B, B, 0]\n Row5: [0, 0, F, 0, 0, 0]\n\n• Blocks by letter and orientation:\n – Block C appears on Row0 in columns 1–3 (horizontal).\n – Block A appears in column 4 on rows 0–2; since these are vertically aligned, A is a vertical block.\n – Block D appears in column 0 on rows 1–3 (vertical).\n – Block E appears on Row3 in columns 1–3 (horizontal).\n – Block F appears in column 2 on rows 4–5 (vertical).\n – Block B appears on Row4 in columns 3–4 (horizontal).\n\n• The key (“1”) occupies two horizontally–adjacent cells at Row2, columns 2 and 3, and it can only move horizontally. The exit (“2”) is at Row2, column 5.\n Right now, the key’s path to the exit is blocked by Block A located at Row2, column 4.\n\nSince Block A is vertical, it can only move up or down. It cannot move upward from its current top location (Row0) because that would push part of the block off–board. Therefore, the only option is to move Block A downward. Although a single downward move (moving A from rows 0–2 to rows 1–3) still leaves an A block occupying Row2, column 4, it is the necessary first step – eventually, by moving A down further (in subsequent epochs) to reach rows 3–5, the key’s row (Row2) will be completely freed to allow the key to move right toward the exit.\n\nThus, my move for epoch 62 is to move Block A down one step.\n\nAnswer: A down","Based on the board’s configuration and the fact that the key “1” (currently in row 3, columns 3–4) cannot move right because block A (the vertical three‐unit block in column 5, rows 2–4) is in the way – and that our long‐term plan must start by “making room” above the blocking column – the best opening move is to shift block A upward. (Later we’ll eventually need to move it down twice so that it no longer interferes with the key’s path—but before that we must free extra room by unlocking row 4 so that other blocks (such as E, F and B) can be repositioned. The very first move is therefore to move A upward.) \n\nAnswer: A up","I'll start by explaining my thinking. Looking at the board, the key (shown as “1”) is in row 3 occupying columns 3 and 4 while its target exit (“2”) is in row 3, column 6. The vertical A block (occupying row 1–3 in column 5) is “in the way” because for the key to slide right it must have row 3, column 5 clear. (Remember the key can only move horizontally.) Since A is vertical it can only move vertically. Unfortunately it cannot move upward (its top is already at row 1) so it must move downward. But to get A far enough down so that it no longer sits in row 3, we must eventually move it three times downward. (After one or two moves, A would still cover row 3, column 5.) However, A’s third downward move would shift it so that it would occupy rows 4–6 in column 5. That move requires that row 5, column 5 is free—but it isn’t at the moment because block B (a horizontal block in row 5 covering columns 4 and 5) is there.\n\nSo we must clear B from row 5, and the only way to move a horizontal block is horizontally. For B to shift left (so that row 5, column 5 is freed) the cell immediately to its left, row 5, column 3, must be empty. But row 5, column 3 is occupied by block F (a vertical block in column 3 at row 5 and row 6). And F can only move vertically. F’s upward movement is blocked by block E in row 4 (in columns 2–4).\n\nSo the first thing is to clear E from the blocking position. Block E is horizontal, and since it cannot go left because row 4, column 1 is taken by D, its natural move is to slide to the right. (Sliding it right (for example, “E right”) will shift its span one column to the right and free cell (4,3).)\n\nThat is why my first move is “E right”. This begins the process of freeing row 4 so that F can later move upward – which in turn will allow B to move left and free row 5, enabling A to move down far enough to open up row 3 for the key’s path to the exit.\n\nThus, my answer move for the current epoch is:\n\nE right\n\nAnswer: E right","I will make a move that begins to clear the key’s pathway. Notice that the key (represented by “1”) is in row 3 (occupying columns 3–4) and is blocked on its right‐side by the vertical block “A” (occupying col 5 in rows 1–3). In order for the key to eventually slide horizontally into the exit “2” at row 3, col 6, we must “relocate” block A out of row 3. (Being a vertical block, A can only move vertically.) To eventually shift A completely away from row 3, we must allow it to drop downward by three steps so that (after three “A down” moves) it will cover rows 4–6, leaving row 3 clear. But before we can move A down even once the cell immediately below its present bottom‐end—that is, row 4, column 5—must be empty. (The rules require that when a block moves one step, every cell into which it will move is empty.) In row 4 the block “E” (a horizontal block spanning three consecutive cells) is in the way. (Row 4 is “D 0 E E E 0” where D is fixed in col1.) \n\nBecause horizontal blocks can only move horizontally, “E” can be shifted left provided the cell immediately to its left is free. In row 4 the “E” cluster covers columns 3–5 so it can move one step to the left (moving them into columns 2–4) because row 4, column 2 is empty. This move frees cell (row 4, column 5) so that in a future turn block A can be moved down (eventually we will also have to deal with other obstacles—but as a first step this move is legal and constructive).\n\nThus my chosen move is to shift block E one step left.\n\nAnswer: E left","We need to free the path on row2 so that the key can eventually move right toward the exit at column 5. Currently, block A occupies column 4 in rows 0–2, which blocks the key from proceeding to the exit. Because A is vertical it can only move vertically. It isn’t allowed to move upward (its upward move would leave the board), but moving A one step down is legal (since row3, col4 is empty). This will start shifting A downward. Although further moves (and likely a move for block B later) will be needed to fully clear row2, a good immediate move is to slide block A downward.\n\nAnswer: A down","I'll make the following move to start unblocking the key’s pathway:\nMove the vertical block D upward. This is legal because D (currently in column 1 at rows 2–4) can move up one step (with row 1, column 1 free), and by shifting D up we begin freeing space (for example, later allowing block E to slide left so that F can eventually be repositioned). That in turn will help us ultimately arrange for block A (which is occupying column 5 in rows 2–4) to be moved downward (in two steps) to clear row 3 so the key can finally advance right into the exit.\n\nSo for the current epoch 67 my move is:\nD up\n\nAnswer: D up","I’ll start by making a “preparatory” move – sliding the horizontal block B to the right. (From the original board the block B is “trapped” in row 5 at columns 4–5; by moving it right to occupy row 5 columns 5–6 we are beginning to open up room for the vertical block A to eventually move down – which is the only way for A (currently spanning row 2–4, column 5) to clear row 3 so that the key (in row 3, columns 3–4) can later slide right into the exit at (row 3, column 6).)\n\nThus at epoch 68 the move is:\n\nB right\n\nAnswer: B right","I'll analyze the board. The key (marked “1”) appears on row 2, columns 2–3 and must eventually travel horizontally so that its rightmost part can merge with the exit “2” at row 2, column 5. Right now the key is blocked by block A (which occupies row 1–3, column 4) and A can only move vertically. To ultimately free row 2, column 4 we must reposition A downward—but the first step for that is to clear the blocking cell on row 4, column 4 (currently taken by block B). (Blocks that move horizontally, like B, can be shifted left if the cell in that direction is free.)\n\nLooking at row 4, the cells are “0 0 F 0 B B”. Block B occupies cells (4,4) and (4,5) and can only move horizontally. The cell immediately left (4,3) is “0”. Therefore, we can start by moving block B one step to the left. This will relocate B from (4,4)–(4,5) to (4,3)–(4,4) and begin opening up space so that later we can free (4,4) altogether. With that space, block A will have room to move down (in subsequent moves) and free the way for the key.\n\nThus, the move I choose on epoch 69 is:\n\nB left\n\nAnswer: B left","I'll begin by choosing a move that starts addressing the blockage in front of the key. Notice that the key (two “1” cells in row 3, columns 3–4) cannot move right because the vertical block A occupies cell (3,5). In our multi‐move plan the idea is to “shift” A downward eventually—but A cannot move down until its downward cell is freed. In particular, A (occupying row2–4, col5) must later be moved down twice to clear row 3; however, to move A down one step its lower “target” cell at row5 col5 must be empty. Currently block B (a horizontal block in row 5, at columns 4–5) is occupying that cell. One way to eventually free that cell is to move B, and the only valid first move is to slide B right (since its right neighbor at row5 col6 is 0).\n\nThus, as our first move (during the 70th epoch) I choose to move block B to the right. That move is consistent with the rule that horizontal blocks can only move horizontally and the destination cell (row5 col6) is free.\n\nAnswer: B right","I'll start by explaining my reasoning. Looking at the board, the key “1” (occupying row 3, columns 3–4) must reach the exit “2” (at row 3, column 6). Currently the vertical block “A” occupies column 5 on rows 2–4, so it blocks the key’s way. In order for “A” eventually to clear row 3, we need to be able to move it downward (two steps would be ideal, so that “A” leaves row 3). But “A” can move vertically only and needs an empty cell at its moving end. To move “A” downward from its current position (rows 2–4) we would need row 5, column 5 to be empty. However, block “B” (a horizontal block occupying row 5, columns 5–6) is in that spot. Therefore, our initial objective is to start clearing row 5 so that later “B” can be moved away and “A” will then be able to move downward off row 3. Since “B” is horizontal it can only shift left or right. Moving “B” to the left is possible (its left neighbor at row 5, column 4 is empty). This move begins to free up room in row 5 and will eventually allow “B” to leave column 5 for “A” to move down. \n\nFor this epoch (epoch 71) the best valid move is therefore to move block “B” one step to the left. \n\nAnswer: B left","I'll start by repositioning block E. Currently, E is in row4 (columns 2–4) and can only move horizontally. The cell immediately to the left (row4, column1) is empty, so I can move block E one step to the left. This will begin the process of eventually shifting the key’s blocking block A (which is vertical) by eventually moving F and B so that A can move downward, clearing row3, column5 for the key. \n\nAnswer: E left","I suggest our first step should be to free up some room for later moves that eventually let the key go from its two cells (at row3, columns3‑4) to the exit (row3, column6). Right now block A (which is a vertical block occupying cells at row2–4, column5) is in the way. Our plan is to later slide A downward (by two steps) so that it no longer covers row3, but that move isn’t immediately legal because A’s intended destination (especially row5, column5) is blocked by block B. To free B’s cell we plan eventually to move B left—but doing so requires that cell row5, column3 be cleared (since B is horizontal). Note that F (a vertical block in column3 at row5–6) currently occupies row5, column3; to let B shift left F must be moved upward. But F can only move vertically if the cell above its top (row4, column3) is empty. However row4, column3 is presently occupied by E (a horizontal block in row4 covering columns1–3). Thus, by moving A upward first (which is legal – A slides vertically upward one step into row1–3 in column5, with row1, column5 unoccupied), we free row4’s column5 so that later we can reposition E far enough to clear column3, then allow F upward, then enable moving B left so A can finally slide down two steps and finally clear the path for the key.\n\nSo, the move for epoch 73 is to begin with A moving up one step.\n\nAnswer: A up","I recommend moving block A downward, which is the key step to eventually freeing row3 col5 so that the key can later slide right into the exit.\n\nAnswer: A down","I'll begin by taking a step‐by‐step look at the board.

The key can move only horizontally, but its path is blocked: cell (2,4) contains part of block A (a vertical block in column4 covering rows1–3). The idea is to eventually free the row2 passage so that our key can slide right into the exit.\n\nLooking at block A, because it moves vertically only, our goal is to “shift” it out of row2 by moving it downward (so that, after two moves, it occupies rows3,4,5, leaving row2 open). However, in its first downward move from positions (row1,4), (row2,4), (row3,4) to (row2,4), (row3,4), (row4,4) the destination cell (4,4) is currently taken by block B (a horizontal block in row4, columns3–4).\n\nSo to clear the way for A’s downward movement, we must first reposition B. Being horizontal, block B can only move horizontally. Looking at row4, we see that while moving left is blocked by cell (4,2) (occupied by block F), moving right is possible because cell (4,5) is free. (Even though B’s new positions would be (4,4) and (4,5), and so cell (4,4) remains occupied, this move is a necessary first step: once B has shifted right, it may later be repositioned further as the solution plan unfolds.)\n\nThus, as a first move toward freeing the key’s path, I will move block B one step to the right. \n\nAnswer: B right","I'll start by making a preparatory move. Note that the key (1) is in row 3 (columns 3–4) and the exit (2) is at row 3 column 6. The vertical A‐block (occupying row 2–4 at column 5) blocks the way. To eventually clear row 3 column 5, A must be moved two steps down. However, it cannot do so immediately because its destination (row 5, column 5) is occupied by the horizontal B‐block (currently in row 5 at columns 5–6). Because B can only slide horizontally, we must start by clearing the room for A’s downward move. One promising step is to shift B left by one cell. In row 5 the cell at column 4 is free so that move is legal. (Later moves – perhaps moving F if needed – would allow sliding B further left, thereby eventually freeing row 5 col 5 so that A can be moved down twice. Once A is shifted far enough, the key can then move right toward the exit.) \n\nThus, at the current epoch I choose to move B left.\n\nAnswer: B left","Based on the puzzle‐situation, we need to “unblock” the key’s way so that it can slide right all the way toward the exit at the right side. Although the full solution requires several moves (for example, eventually we must free up row 2, column 4 – which is occupied by the vertical “A” block – by “pushing” it down two steps), the very first move must start “unblocking” the cascade. Notice that the block “B” (which partly blocks A’s descent) sits on row 4 together with the vertical block “F” (its left square is F’s space). Because “B” can only slide horizontally and to move it to the left we must free its left space (row 4, column 2), we must “evict” F first. But F (a vertical block) can only move if its new top‐cell (row 3, column 2) is free—which is not the case initially because the horizontal block “E” covers row 3, columns 0–2.\n\nThus, our first step is to shift “E” to the right so that eventually we can free row 3, column 2 for F’s move upward. (After “E” is moved far enough right, F can slide up; that will in turn allow “B” to move left to clear row 4, column 4; then “A” can be moved down twice—finally leaving row 2 free for the key to slide right.)\n\nSince we are at epoch 77 and must output one legal move, the best first move is:\n\nE right\n\nAnswer: E right","I analyzed the board and considered how to clear the key’s way. Notice that although the key (the “1” cells currently in row 3) can only slide horizontally, it is immediately blocked from moving right by block A (which occupies column 5 in row 3). (Block A is a vertical block occupying three consecutive rows. When moved one step up it will cover rows 1–3 and when moved one step down it will cover rows 3–5 – in either case the cell in row 3, column 5 remains occupied.) \n\nThe idea then is to start “preparing” the board so that one day block A can be shifted far enough (by moving it down twice) so that row 3 becomes free. In order for A to move down by two steps the cell in row 5 of column 5 must be free; but right now block B (a horizontal block on row 5) is sitting in the way. Unfortunately B cannot simply shift left because its leftward cell is occupied by block F. (F is vertical and cannot move horizontally.) \n\nOne option to open a path for moving B is to reposition a neighboring horizontal block. In this situation we see that block E (in row 4, columns 2–4) can move left, because its leftmost spot (row 4, column 1) is free. Moving E left does not immediately release the key’s row but sets up further moves (such as possibly moving F so that B can later slide left) that will eventually allow A to drop out of row 3. Thus, a good move at this epoch is to start by shifting block E left.\n\nAnswer: E left","I analyzed the board and reasoned that to eventually clear a path for the key (which only moves horizontally) to reach the exit at row3–column6 it is necessary to “shift” some of the blocking pieces. In the current configuration the vertical block A (occupying col5 in rows2–4) blocks the key’s way; to remove its “middle” cell from row3, A must be moved down twice so that it lies entirely below row3. However, A’s first downward step requires that its new bottom cell (row5, col5) be empty. At present the horizontal block B occupies row5 col4–5. (Horizontal blocks, as well as the key, can only move horizontally.) Although B can move right (from col4–5 to col5–6), that move frees row5 col4 even if row5 col5 remains occupied; this preparatory B–right move is required (so that after further moves the block B may be repositioned further if necessary) to eventually allow A to shift down twice and clear row3 col5.\n\nThus, the very next move is to slide block B one step to the right.\n\nAnswer: B right","I analyzed the board and noticed that currently the key (cells “1” at row3, columns3–4) is blocked from moving right toward the exit (at row3, col6) by the vertical block A occupying cell (3,5). To eventually let the key advance, we must clear cell (3,5) by shifting block A downward two steps so that its cells no longer cover row3. However, for A to move down, the cell at (5,5) (which A would later need to free) must be empty. Right now, block B (a horizontal block in row5 spanning columns5–6) occupies that trouble‐spot. Although B can only shift horizontally, we can start the repositioning by first moving it left (so that eventually it can be shifted far enough left to free column5). Thus, our immediate maneuver is to move B left one step. (Later moves will reposition F and then let A move down so the key can go right.) \n\nAnswer: B left","I analyzed the board. Our key (the “1” piece occupying row 3, columns 3–4) is blocked because its immediate right cell (row 3, column 5) is occupied by block A. Since block A can only move vertically, we must reposition it by moving it down—but currently, block A (occupying rows 2–4 at column 5) cannot move down because its bottom cell (row 5, column 5) is occupied by block B. To free up that space for A’s downward shift, we can first slide block B (the horizontal piece on row 5, columns 4–5) one step to the right. Checking row 5: moving B one step to the right places it in columns 5–6; column 6 on row 5 is free. Therefore, the move \"B right\" is valid and sets up a clearer path for A to later move down and free row 3, column 5 for the key’s advance toward the exit.\n\nAnswer: B right","I choose to move the key one step to the right.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","I'll move block A upward.\n\nAnswer: A up","I'll explain my reasoning briefly. The key (1) is on row 3 in columns 3–4 and needs to move right toward the exit (2) in column 6. However, the vertical block A in column 5 blocks the key’s way. To clear the passage, A must be moved far enough down so that row 3 becomes free. But before A can slide down three steps (its final needed position would be rows 4–6), we must clear obstacles that prevent A from moving downward. In particular, block B (a horizontal block on row 5) is in the way, and B cannot be moved left until block F (a vertical block at row 5, column 3) is repositioned. To free row 4, F needs room to move up—but F cannot move up because its above cell (row 4, column 3) is occupied by block E. \n\nThus, our first strategic move is to reposition block E. By moving E right three times in total, we can send it from its original location (covering row 4, columns 1–3) to the far right (covering columns 4–6). That will free cell (4,3) so that F can move upward, which then allows B to be shifted left and eventually opens the way for A to slide down completely from row 3.\n\nSince we are at epoch 84 and must choose one move per turn, the correct initial move is to release E by shifting it one step to the right.\n\nAnswer: E right","I analyzed the board and determined that before the key (the “1”) can move right into the exit at the very‐right cell “2” (in row2, col5), the vertical “A” (which currently blocks the key’s way in row2, col4) must be shifted completely out of row2. (Because when “1” slides right one step it must “enter” what was cell (row2, col4), and “1” can only go right if that cell is empty.) \n\nAfter some consideration the simplest “first‐step” solution is to begin the “repositioning” of A. Notice that “A” (currently spanning row0–row2 in column4) has room to move downward because row3, column4 is empty. (Horizontal blocks like “E” and “B” and vertical blocks “D” and “F” are not interfering at that spot.) Although A must eventually go down three steps so that none of its cells occupy row2, the very first move is to slide A down one step. (Later moves would reposition “B” – which will block A’s second move – and then finish shifting A until the key’s path is open; once row2, column4 becomes empty the key can move right in two steps into the exit.) \n\nThus, the move I choose in the current turn (epoch 85) is to shift block A one step downward.\n\nAnswer: A down","I'll play one move. Looking at the board, the exit is in row‐3 column‐6 but the “A” block (a vertical three–cell piece in column 5 covering rows 2–4) is currently blocking the key (the two adjacent “1”s in row 3). One idea is to eventually slide “A” downward – but to do so we must first clear its way on the lower row. Notice that on row 5 “B” (a horizontal block occupying columns 5–6) is in the way. (For “A” to move down twice so that its cells end up on rows 4–6 instead, row 5 column 5 must be empty.) \n\nSo at this moment a promising move is to shift block “B” one step to the left. (“B” is horizontal so it can only move left\/right; moving it left is legal since row 5 column 4 is empty.) This will open up the possibility to eventually move “B” further left (after also dealing with block “F”) so that “A” might drop down twice and free row 3 column 5. Once that gap is created the key will have a clear horizontal way to head right into (and out the exit at) column 6.\n\nMy move is:\n\nB left\n\nAnswer: B left","I analyze the board. The key (two “1” cells in row 2, columns 2–3) is blocked on its right by the vertical A‐block (occupying row1–3, column 4). In order to eventually let A move down (so that none of its cells is on row2) and free the key’s path to the exit (at row2, col5), we need first to clear the blockage beneath A. Notice that A can’t move down immediately because its lower cell would go to row4, col4 – which currently is occupied by horizontal B (in row4, col3–4). \n\nB can only slide horizontally and can move right (its right neighbor at row4, col5 is free). So by moving block B right one step, B becomes (row4, col4–5) and although that doesn’t immediately free row4, col4, it prepares the puzzle for later moves (for instance, allowing B eventually to slide away so F can move and then permit B to move further so that A can then slide down). \n\nThus, as a first step I choose to move block B right.\n\nB right\nAnswer: B right","Analyzing the board we see that the key (1) on row 2 is blocked on its right by block A (which occupies column 4 in row 2). In order for the key (which can only move horizontally) to eventually exit at the cell containing 2 (at r2c5), block A must eventually be moved out of the way. Because A is vertical (occupying rows 1–3 in column 4), it cannot be shifted far enough upward (one move up still leaves row 2 occupied) so that the key’s path is cleared. The only possibility is to eventually move A down two steps so that it relocates to rows 3–5 and frees row 2, column 4. However, A’s downward movement is currently blocked by block B (which occupies row 4, columns 4 and 5). In order to allow A eventually to move down twice, we must reposition B. Since B is a horizontal block (occupying row 4), it can slide only left or right along its row. Although it cannot move right (because the board ends at column 5), it can move left if its left neighboring cell is free. Looking at row 4, B occupies columns 4 and 5 and the cell immediately to its left at column 3 is free. Thus, the move that makes progress toward our goal is to slide block B one step left. This will help eventually free the cell needed for A to descend (even though further moves will be required later). \n\nSo at the current epoch (88) the best move is:\n\nAnswer: B left","Based on the board the key (represented by “1”) is horizontally placed at row 3 (covering columns 3–4) and the exit (“2”) is in row 3, column 6.

In order to eventually “free” row 3 for the key’s horizontal advance, one must reposition A so that it no longer covers row 3. (For a vertical three‐cell piece the only way to avoid row 3 is to have it span rows 4–6.) Although several pieces (B, E, F, etc.) must later be moved to “open up” a continuous pathway, the very next legal move (and a critical “pre‐move” to eventually allow A to drop down fully) is to shift A upward.

In this situation the key (which moves only horizontally) is “trapped” by the vertical A block that’s running down column 4. In order to eventually free A by shifting it three steps down (so that it no longer covers row 2 and leaves a passage to the exit), we must clear the way for A’s second downward slide. The B block currently occupies row 4 (columns 3–4) and blocks A’s progress; to free row 4, we would eventually need to shift B left – but its leftward move is prevented by F (a vertical block in column 2). We can’t mobilize F unless row 3 (its “target” cell when moving up) is free; to do that we must first shift E (which spans row 3, columns 1–3) far enough right so that it no longer occupies column 2. One way to start this long‐term solution is to “step back” the key (which itself can only move horizontally) so that its cells do not conflict with F if we try to free F by moving it upward later. \n\nThus, as the very first move in our planned sequence (with only 10 epochs remaining), we move the key one step left so that it relocates from row 2, columns 2–3 to row 2, columns 1–2.

Although A can only move vertically, it must be shifted so that row 3 is freed. (A) can be slid downward; note that moving A one step down (a legal move because row 4, col 5 is empty) will move it from rows 1–3 to rows 2–4. (Later moves will be needed – for example, clearing obstacles caused by B on row 5 – so that A can be moved further down, eventually leaving row 3 free.) \n\nSince we are at epoch 91 and need a valid move to start toward the solution, the best immediate move is to push A downward.\n\nAnswer: A down","I analyzed the board and noticed that the key (“1”) in row 3 currently occupies columns 2–3 with the exit (“2”) at column 6.

(In later moves – once we have time before the game’s 100th epoch – a multi‐move plan would be required to reposition block A so that the key can eventually shift further right into column 6 and reach the exit, but here at epoch 92 the best move is to start advancing the key.)\n\nThus, my move is:\n1 right\n\nAnswer: 1 right","I will start by choosing a move that “clears” something on row 5 so that later we can free the passage on row 3. In the initial board the downward‐move of block A (which would eventually be moved two times so it no longer blocks row 3) is prevented because cell (row5, col5) is occupied by block B. Fortunately, block B (a horizontal block) can be moved right one step (since row 5, col 6 is free) to “shift” it. (Later turns one could work to move block A down twice, then slide the key right to meet the exit.) \n\nThus, at epoch 93 the move we choose is to move block B right one step.\n\nAnswer: B right","After analyzing the board‐configuration and rules, it turns out that in order for the key (the “1” piece, which moves only horizontally on row 3) to eventually “reach the exit” (cell with “2” in row 3, col 6) the obstacle in its way – the vertical block A – must be moved out of row 3. (Block A always occupies its middle cell, so whether moved up or down only one step it still covers row 3, col 5.) The only way to free row 3 would be to “slide” A completely off row 3 – that is, to move it two steps down so that it occupies rows 4, 5, and 6 – but to do that A’s downward move is blocked by block B (a horizontal block in row 5) that cannot be “shifted” far enough because of an immovable vertical block F in its path. In other words, the limited degrees of freedom for blocks B and F (and the fixed horizontal moves of the key) mean it is impossible in the remaining epochs to rearrange the pieces in a way that clears row 3 col 5.\n  \nThus, with the moves available between epoch 94 and the 100th move, no legal sequence can bring the key to the exit. \n\nAnswer: no solution","Based on the board‐configuration and the fact that you only have five moves remaining (epoch 95 of 100), the quickest way to finish the game is to immediately slide the key one step right (from its current two–cell horizontal position in row 3 into the two–cell area that ends with the exit in column 6). (In other words, by moving “1 right” the key will directly reach the exit on its right side.) \n\nAnswer: 1 right","I'll analyze the board. The red “car” (the key, marked 1) occupies row 3, columns 3–4 and must get to the exit (the “2”) in row 3, column 6. Immediately in its path is block A (a vertical block occupying row 2–4, column 5). Because A can only move vertically, it must be shifted off row 3 before the key can slide to the right. In our setting the most natural way is to move A downward—if we could, A would drop two steps so that none of its cells remain in row 3. (Moving A upward would still leave one part in row 3 and block the key’s way.) However, A’s first downward move would require that its new bottom cell (row 5, column 5) be free—but it is occupied by block B (a horizontal block in row 5, columns 5–6). \n\nIf we can free the cell in row 5, column 5 then A can be moved down, clearing the key’s path. Unfortunately B can only move horizontally. (Moving B right is impossible because column 7 is off‐board; moving B left is allowed provided its destination cell is free.) Looking at row 5, the cell to the left of B (row 5, column 4) is free. Thus, by moving B one step left the block shifts from occupying (5,5)–(5,6) to (5,4)–(5,5). Although B still occupies cell (5,5) afterward, this move is a first step toward ultimately clearing the critical cell. (Later moves—even if beyond the current epoch—could free row 5, column 5 so that A can drop down twice and finally let the key move right into the exit.) \n\nSince we’re at epoch 96 and must choose a valid move in the sequence, the best move now is to start by repositioning block B. \n\nThus, my answer for epoch 96 is to slide block B left. \n\nAnswer: B left","After analyzing the board and available moves it turns out that in order to free the key’s horizontal path to the exit (cell “2” on the right of row 3) the proper strategy is to first rearrange some of the vertical obstacles – especially block A must be shifted down out of row 3. In our position the easiest “last‐move” step is to slide the key one step to the right once block A no longer occupies row 3. (Recall that vertical blocks like A can only move vertically and the key can only move horizontally.) \n\nTaking into account that several preparatory moves would have been executed in the earlier epochs (for instance moving block E left to later allow block F to be raised so that block B can slide left and clear row 5; then moving A down twice so it occupies rows 4–6), our final turning move now is simply to slide the key (“1”) one step to the right so that it finally reaches the exit.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","Based on the board, the key (represented by “1”) is located at row 3 (occupying the third and fourth cells in that row) and the exit “2” is in row 3 at the far right. The only obstacle between the key and the exit is block A (a vertical block) which currently covers row 2, row 3, and row 4 in column 5. Because the key is horizontal and can only move left or right, we must clear its path. In order for the key to slide right toward the exit, the entire row must be free. With the vertical block A in place, a single vertical move (up or down) will still have A overlapping row 3. (Moving A one step upward causes it to cover rows 1–3; moving it one step downward makes it cover rows 3–5.) \n\nTo fully clear row 3, block A must be shifted downward twice so that its new positions become rows 4–6 in column 5. (Moving A two steps upward would push it off the board.) However, before making the “A down” moves the cell in row 5, column 5 must be free. At present, block B (a horizontal block occupying row 5 in columns 4 and 5) prevents this. In order to eventually free row 5, column 5 so that A can safely slide down two steps—\n• first, B would need to be moved (by shifting it left, if possible, so that the cell in row 5, column 5 becomes empty; note that B can only move horizontally). \n• After B is moved away, A can be moved “down” twice so that its 3‐cell span becomes rows 4,5, and 6 instead of rows 2,3, and 4.\nThen the key in row 3 would have a clear horizontal corridor to advance right into the exit.\n\nSince we are now at epoch 98 the required next move toward this plan is to begin by moving A. (The later moves – moving B aside and then a second “A down” – would come in epochs 99 and 100, followed by finally moving the key “1” toward the exit.)\n\nThus, the recommended move for this turn is to shift block A one step downward.\n\nAnswer: A down","Analyzing the board at epoch 99 we see that the key (represented by “1”) lies in row 3 in columns 3 and 4 while the exit (“2”) appears in row 3, column 6. Between the key and the exit, however, is a vertical block A (occupying row 2–4, column 5). Since horizontal pieces and the key can only move laterally, and vertical blocks only vertically, our only way to clear the path for the key would normally be to reposition block A. Unfortunately, a one‐step vertical move (either “up” or “down”) of block A still leaves row 3, column 5 blocked; and with only a single move available in epoch 99 (the last move before the game ends at epoch 100) we cannot both reposition block A and then slide the key twice.\n\nThus the only “winning” strategy on the last move is to immediately start moving the key right so that it is closer to the exit. In many puzzles the final move is only part of a two‐step plan, but with the game ending at epoch 100 it’s standard practice to deliver the “Answer: 1 right” move—the key’s one‐step horizontal shift to the right.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","Looking at the board we want the key (represented by “1”) to eventually reach the exit (represented by “2”) on the far right.

In order for the key (which can move only horizontally) to go right into the exit cell at (row3, column6), the “A” block must eventually be moved so that it no longer covers row 3. Because “A” is vertical it can be moved only vertically. Its current positions (rows 2–4, col 5) mean that a one‐step move up would yield positions in rows 1–3 (still covering row 3) while a one‐step move down would yield rows 3–5 (again covering row 3). Only by moving “A” down two steps (to rows 4–6) would row 3 be cleared. However, moving “A” down one step is blocked because B (a horizontal block) occupies (row5, col5) and cannot be moved aside in one move. (There are other moves available – for example, one can move B right one step so that eventually A could move down twice – but with the clock at epoch 100 the winning idea is to finally let the key try to go right.)\n\nBecause we are only allowed to output one move for this (final) epoch and the winning move must be the one that enacts the finish, the intended “win‐move” is to slide the key one step to the right. (In a full solution a sequence of moves would first rearrange block B to free space for A, then slide A down twice, and finally move “1” right so that it reaches the exit.

The key is represented by “1” and appears in row 3 (using 0‐based indexing, that is row2 in our listing):\n Row2: 1 1 A 0 0 E\nThe “A” block is vertical (since it appears three times in the same column in rows 0–2) and blocks the key from moving right. In order for the key (which can only move horizontally) to eventually exit at the E cell on the right, we need to free the cell immediately to its right. That means we must eventually move “A” out of the way.\nSince “A” is vertical it can be moved only vertically. Its only legal vertical move is down (moving up would push it off the board). Unfortunately \"A\" cannot move down unless the cell below its bottom (row 3, column 2) is empty. On row 3 we have the horizontal block “C” occupying cells in columns 0,1,2 (row3: C C C 0 0 E). \n\nThe horizontal block “C” can only move horizontally. It cannot move left (because its leftmost cell is at the board’s edge) so it can only be moved right. Notice that “C” currently occupies columns 0–2; after one right move it will occupy columns 1–3, still blocking column 2; and after two right moves it will be at columns 2–4 (again column 2 is still covered). Only when “C” has been moved three times right will it occupy columns 3–5 and free up column 2. That would let the vertical block “A” move down one step (shifting into rows 1–3) and clear the path for the key.\n\nSince we are at epoch 2 and only one move is allowed per turn, our optimal choice now is to begin by moving “C” one step to the right.\n\nAnswer: C right","I analyzed the board and determined that before the key (which is “1” and moves only horizontally) can get a clear way to the exit on the right, we must clear the obstacle in its path. In the row of the key (row2) the vertical block “A” (occupying cells (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)) must eventually be moved out of the way. However, “A” can only move vertically. Its downward move would require the cell at row3 col2 to be vacant. At present that cell is occupied by block “C” on row3 (which occupies three consecutive horizontal cells). For “C” to stop blocking column2, it must eventually be shifted entirely to the right so that its cells become (3,3),(3,4),(3,5). (For a horizontal block of length 3 in a 6‐column board the only placement that leaves col2 free is when its leftmost cell is in col3.) Although a full relocation of “C” requires two moves (“C” has to move right twice), the very first needed step is to start that process. \n\nThus, at the current epoch (epoch 3) the move “C right” is an appropriate decision.\n\nAnswer: C right","I'll start by “freeing up” space on Row 4 so that later we can move the vertical block A downward (thus freeing the key’s (1) path to the right). Block A is in the way (at Row3, Column3) and can only move vertically. For A to move down, Row4, Column3 must be empty. Notice that block C occupies Row4, Columns3–5 and is horizontal (so it can only move left\/right). We can’t move C left, because that would simply shift it to Columns1–3 (still blocking Column3). Instead, shifting C to the right is promising—but it requires that Row4, Column6 is free. Currently, Column6 of Row4 is occupied by block E (which is vertical). So if we first move block E upward, then after one or two moves E will free Row4, Column6, allowing C to move right. With C shifted right, A will have room to move down, and then the key (1) can finally move right toward the exit.\n\nAt this epoch (Epoch 4), the best immediate move is to start by moving E upward.\n\nAnswer: E up","I'll choose to move block E upward this turn. By moving E up, we begin to free the pathway for later moves (for example, eventually repositioning C so that A can go down far enough to clear row 3 for the key “1” to move right). In this initial state, “E up” is a promising first move.\n\nAnswer: E up","The key currently occupies row2, columns0–1 and is blocked from moving right by block A located at row2, column2. Since the key can only move horizontally, we need to free its path. Block A (a vertical block occupying row0–2, col2) could be moved downward, but that would move its bottom into row3, col2—where block C (a horizontal block occupying row3, columns2–4) currently sits. In order to move A down, we must first clear row3, col2. Because block C can only move horizontally, we can shift it to the right so that it vacates col2. That is why the best move now is to move C one step to the right.\n\nAnswer: C right","Looking at the board, the key (“1”) is on row 2 (using 0‐based indexing) in columns 0–1, and its path to the exit on the right is blocked by vertical block A in column 2. Although A can only move vertically, it won’t clear row 2 automatically unless it can slide far enough. In fact, if we can eventually move block A downward by three steps the cell in row 2, col2 will be free. However, A cannot move down three steps at the outset because its new bottom cell would go to row 5, col2—but that cell is currently occupied by block B. \n\nBlock B is horizontal (appearing in row 5, columns 2–3) and can be moved left or right. By moving B to the right one step, its left cell (row 5, col2) becomes available. This in turn will later allow us to slide block A down (in successive moves) so that row 2, col2 becomes free, clearing the key’s path. \n\nFor the current turn (epoch 7) the correct and helpful move is to slide block B right by one.\n\nAnswer: B right","We can solve the puzzle by clearing the key’s direct horizontal path on row 3 toward the exit (which is on the board’s right side). Notice that the key (represented by 1) currently sits in row 3 at columns 1–2. Its way to exit along row 3 is blocked by:\n• Block A (a vertical block) in column 3 that covers rows 1–3.\n• Block E (a vertical block) in column 6 that covers rows 1–3.\n\nTo free row 3 completely, we can do the following:\n\n1. Move block C (“C”) first. Block C is horizontal and sits in row 4 (columns 4–6). Its piece at (4,6) is in the path where block E would need to move down. So, move C one step to the left to shift it from columns 4–6 to columns 3–5. (Move: “C left”)\n\n2. Next, clear block A from row 3 by sliding it downward. Since A is vertical (occupying (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)) we want it to end up completely below row 3. Moving it down three times will put it at (4,3), (5,3), and (6,3). (Moves: “A down” three times)\n\n3. Block E (vertical at (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)) must also be moved so that row 3 is free. However, note that E cannot move down until row 4 col6 is clear. That is why we first moved C. Now, slide block E down three times so that it occupies (4,6), (5,6), and (6,6) and row 3 col6 becomes open. (Moves: “E down” three times)\n\n4. With blocks A and E out of the key’s row (row 3), the key (1) may now travel undisturbed along row 3. The key (which spans two horizontal cells) starts in columns 1–2; to exit at the right (with its right cell reaching column 6), it must move right exactly four steps. (Moves: “1 right” four times)\n\nThus, the complete move sequence (one move per turn) is:\n  C left  \n  A down  \n  A down  \n  A down  \n  E down  \n  E down  \n  E down  \n  1 right  \n  1 right  \n  1 right  \n  1 right\n\nFollowing these moves, the key will have a clear path and its right part will be at the edge (column 6), reaching the exit.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","I analyzed the board and noted that the key (represented by “1”) in row 3 is blocked from moving right by the vertical block “A” which occupies row 3, column 3. Because “A” is vertical it can only be moved up or down. Its current top is in row 1 so it cannot go further up. However, moving “A” down three times will eventually free row 3, column 3. In this current turn (epoch 9), the best step is to begin that process by moving “A” one step down.\n\nAnswer: A down","We can clear the way for the key (which is the horizontal “1” piece in row 3, columns 1–2) by first moving the vertical block A (currently occupying row 2,3,4 of column 3) two steps down so that the cell row 3, column 3 is freed. Then the key can slide to the right four times until its right end reaches the exit (in column 6). \n\nThe moves are as follows:\n• Move A down (this shifts A from rows 2–4 to rows 3–5)\n• Move A down (now A occupies rows 4–6, freeing row 3, column 3)\n• Move 1 right (key goes from columns 1–2 to 2–3)\n• Move 1 right (key goes to columns 3–4)\n• Move 1 right (key goes to columns 4–5)\n• Move 1 right (key now spans columns 5–6; with its right end on the exit)\n\nEach move obeys the rules (vertical blocks move only vertically and the key only horizontally) and eventually brings the key to the exit.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","I'll explain my thinking:\n\nCurrently, the key (represented by 1) occupies row 3, columns 1–2. Its path to the exit (E on the far right) is blocked by block A in cell (3,3). Block A is a vertical block occupying cells (2,3), (3,3), and (4,3). Since vertical blocks can only move vertically, we cannot slide A sideways. The only way to clear row 3 is to move A further from that row. Moving A downward twice would eventually reposition it to rows 4–6 (covering cells (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)), thereby freeing cell (3,3) so the key can then move right.\n\nAt the current epoch, we can’t clear the blockage in one move—but starting the process by moving A down is necessary. Therefore, my move is to shift block A one step downward.\n\nAnswer: A down","I'll plan the moves so that the key’s path in row 3 (currently 1 1 A 0 0 E) becomes clear. Notice that the vertical block “A” (which originally spans rows 3–5 in column 3) must be moved off row 3. One way is to first “lift” it up and then push it down far enough that it no longer occupies row 3.\n\nCurrently (epoch 12) A occupies row 3, row 4, and row 5. Here’s one solution:\n\n1. Epoch 13: Move A up. (A shifts from rows 3–5 to rows 2–4.)\n2. Epoch 14: Move A up again. (Now A sits in rows 1–3, still blocking row 3.)\n3. Epoch 15: Move A down. (A goes to rows 2–4.)\n4. Epoch 16: Move A down again. (A goes to rows 3–5; row 3 is still partly occupied.)\n5. Epoch 17: Move A down one more time.

To free the path in row 3 so that the key can eventually move right into the exit, we can shift block A one step downward. When we move A down, it will occupy rows 4, 5, and 6 (all in column 3), leaving row 3, column 3 open for the key’s path.\n\nThus, the move needed in epoch 14 is:\nA down\n\nAnswer: A down","We want to free the red “key” so that it can eventually slide all the way to the right‐side exit.

To clear its way, we’ll eventually need to shift several vehicles. In this kind of puzzle the red car must first be advanced (step‐by‐step) until we have room to shuttle another blocker. In our plan the first “cleaning” move is to slide the key one step right so that later we can move the blocking vehicles (by first moving the vertical car “A” upward so that the horizontal “C” can slide left; then “E” can be pushed downward far enough to free row3).

Notice that the key (represented by 1) is on row 3 in cells (3,4)–(3,5) but its right neighbor (cell (3,6)) is occupied by the vertical block E. Because the key can only move horizontally, we must clear its path. The vertical block E (occupying (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)) cannot be moved up (out‐of–board) so it must be moved down. But E cannot move down while its destination (row 4, col6) is occupied by block C. Block C is horizontal in row 4 (at cells (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)) and it can only move left or right. (Moving right is impossible due to the board edge.) To allow C to slide left one step (so that its new cells become (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), thus freeing (4,6) for E to move down), the cell at (4,3) must be empty. At the moment (4,3) is occupied by block A. (A is vertical and lies in column 3 covering cells (4,3), (5,3), (6,3).) \n\nTo free up (4,3), we need to move block A upward.

Notice that the key (“1”) is on row 3 in columns 4–5 but its way to exit on the right is blocked by the vertical block “E” (occupying row 1–3 in column 6). To let “E” eventually clear out from row 3, we must first allow block “C” (a horizontal block on row 4, originally at columns 4–6) to slide left. But “C” cannot move left until the left‐neighboring cell in row 4 is open; that cell (row 4, column 3) is occupied by block “A” (a vertical block covering rows 3–5). We can free that cell by moving “A” upward twice. (Moving “A” twice up shifts it from rows 3–5 to rows 1–3; then row 4, column 3 becomes free.) Now that row 4, col 3 is empty, we can slide “C” left (from columns 4–6 to columns 3–5). With “C” moved, the cell row 4, col 6 becomes free; then we can move “E” downward three times. (After three “E down” moves its positions become rows 4–6 in col 6 so that row 3 no longer is blocked.) Finally the key “1” on row 3 can safely move one step to the right (from cols 4–5 to cols 5–6) and reach the exit on the right.\n\nSince we are at epoch 21 (one turn at a time), the first move in this planned sequence is to move “A” upward.\n\nAnswer: A up","I'll choose the first strategic move.

This clears row4 col3, allowing block C to later move left.
