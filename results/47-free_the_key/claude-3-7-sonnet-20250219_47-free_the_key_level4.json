I need to move block C to the right to create space for block A to move down.\n\nSince horizontal blocks can only move horizontally, I'll move block C to the right.\n\nAnswer: C right","I need to analyze the game board and determine my next move to help the key (1) reach the exit (2).\n\nLooking at the board:\n- The key (1) is in the 3rd row\n- The exit (2) is at the end of the 3rd row\n- To reach the exit, the key needs to move right past blocks A and B\n\nCurrently, the key (1) is blocked by block A directly to its right. Block A is a vertical block that can only move vertically. If we move block A down, it would hit block C, which is a horizontal block at the bottom. \n\nSince block A can't move down enough to clear the path for the key, let's check if we can move block A up. If block A moves up, it would extend to row 1. This seems possible since there's no obstacle there.\n\nMoving block A up would allow the key to move right, but then it would hit block B, which is horizontal. Block B would need to move right, but it appears it can't move right further because of the edge of the board.\n\nLet's try moving block A up to create a path for the key.\n\nAnswer: A up","I'll analyze the game board and determine the best move to help the key reach the exit.\n\nThe game board has the key (1) at position (2,1) and (2,2), and the exit (2) at position (2,5).\n\nLet me analyze what's blocking the key's path to the exit:\n- Block A is vertical, located at positions (1,3), (2,3), and (3,3)\n- Blocks B are horizontal at positions (3,4) and (3,5)\n- Block D is vertical at positions (0,4) and (1,4)\n\nTo get the key to the exit, I need to create a clear horizontal path. The key needs to move right past block A. Since A is a vertical block, it can move up or down. There's space above A, so I should move A upward.\n\nAfter moving A upward, the key would be able to pass through that space and continue toward the exit.\n\nAnswer: A up","Looking at the game board at epoch 72, I need to move blocks to help the key (1) reach the exit (2).\n\nHere's my analysis:\n- The key (1) is in position (1,2) in the third row\n- The exit (2) is on the right side in the third row\n- Block A is blocking the key from reaching the exit\n- Block D is also in the path, but positioned above where the key needs to go\n\nTo proceed, I need to move block A out of the way.

The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.\"Answer: 1 right\".\nThe game contains horizontal and vertical blocks (represented by letters), a key (1), and an exit (2). Your goal is to move the blocks and the key to help the key reach the exit. Horizontal blocks can only move horizontally, vertical blocks can only move vertically, and the key can only move horizontally. Control the blocks and the key to make moves so that the key successfully reaches the exit on the right side.\nIn each turn, output the block\/key and its moving direction. For example, \"Answer: 1 right\" means moving the key one step to the right, and \"Answer: F up\" means moving the block labeled 'F' one step upward.\nRemember,the game will end at 100th epoch.\nCurrent epoch:101\nBoard:\n0 0 0 A 0 0\n0 0 0 A 0 0\n1 1 0 A 0 2\nD F E E E C\nD F 0 0 B C\n0 0 0 0 B C\n\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.\"Answer: 1 right\".\nThe game contains horizontal and vertical blocks (represented by letters), a key (1), and an exit (2). Your goal is to move the blocks and the key to help the key reach the exit.
