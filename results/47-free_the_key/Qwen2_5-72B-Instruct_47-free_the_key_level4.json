Control the blocks and the key to make moves so that the key successfully reaches the exit on the right side.\nIn each turn, output the block\/key and its moving direction. For example, \"Answer: 1 right\" means moving the key one step to the right, and \"Answer: F up\" means moving the block labeled 'F' one step upward.\nRemember,the game will end at 100th epoch.\nCurrent epoch:101\nBoard:\n0 F 0 0 D 0\n0 F 0 A D 0\n0 1 1 A 0 2\n0 0 0 A B B\nE 0 0 0 0 0\nE C C C 0 0\n\n","epoch":101,"seed":0,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Given the current layout, the key needs to move right twice to reach the exit. However, we must ensure no blocks are obstructing the path.\n\nLet's check the possible moves:\n\n1. The key (1) is currently blocked by the vertical block 'A' above it and the horizontal block 'E' below it.\n2. We need to move block 'A' up or down to clear the path for the key. Moving 'A' up would be more strategic as it will create space for the key to move right.\n\nFirst, let's move block 'A' up:\n\n- Move 'A' up: This will free up the space next to the key.\n\nAfter moving 'A' up, the board will look like this:\n```\n0 C C C 0 0\nD 0 0 0 A 0\nD 0 1 1 0 2\nD E E E 0 0\n0 0 F B B 0\n0 0 F 0 0 0\n```\n\nNow, the key can move right:\n\n- Move key (1) right: This will move the key closer to the exit.\n\nAfter moving the key right, the board will look like this:\n```\n0 C C C 0 0\nD 0 0 0 A 0\nD 0 0 1 0 2\nD E E E 0 0\n0 0 F B B 0\n0 0 F 0 0 0\n```\n\nFinally, move the key right again to reach the exit:\n\n- Move key (1) right: This will place the key on the exit.\n\nAnswer: A up\nAnswer: 1 right\nAnswer: 1 right","Given that the current epoch is 100, which is the final turn, and considering the positions of the blocks and the key, it's clear that no further moves can be made as the game ends at this point. The key is currently adjacent to the exit but cannot move right due to the presence of block A. Therefore, the game concludes without the key reaching the exit.\n\nAnswer: Game Over"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.\"Answer: 1 right\".\nThe game contains horizontal and vertical blocks (represented by letters), a key (1), and an exit (2).

Control the blocks and the key to make moves so that the key successfully reaches the exit on the right side.\nIn each turn, output the block\/key and its moving direction.

The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.\"Answer: 1 right\".\nThe game contains horizontal and vertical blocks (represented by letters), a key (1), and an exit (2). Your goal is to move the blocks and the key to help the key reach the exit. Horizontal blocks can only move horizontally, vertical blocks can only move vertically, and the key can only move horizontally. Control the blocks and the key to make moves so that the key successfully reaches the exit on the right side.\nIn each turn, output the block\/key and its moving direction.
