We also note that there are no direct obstacles between the key and the exit except for these blocks.\n\nLet's start by moving the 'A' block out of the way to create a path for the key. Since the 'A' block is horizontal, we can move it to the left or right. Moving it to the left would be more beneficial as it will create space for the key to move towards the right.\n\nMove 'A' to the left:\n```\nC C 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 A 0 0 0\n0 D D D 0 0\n0 0 0 0 B F\n0 0 E E B F\n```\n\nNow, the key can move to the right:\n```\nC C 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n0 D D D 0 0\n0 0 0 0 B F\n0 0 E E B F\n```\n\nNext, we need to move the 'D' block down to clear a path for the key:\n```\nC C 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 D D D 0 0\n0 0 E E B F\n```\n\nFinally, the key can move all the way to the right:\n```\nC C 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 D D D 0 0\n0 0 E E B F\n```\n\nThus, the first move to make progress towards the solution is moving the 'A' block to the left.\n\nAnswer: A left","To solve this game, we need to move the key (1) to the exit (2) while maneuvering around the blocks.

Afterward, 'A' can be moved to the left or right to clear the path for the key.\n\nLet's start by moving 'F' up to open space for 'B':\n- Move 'F' up.\n\nNow the board looks like this:\n```\nE 0 A D D 0\nE 0 A 0 0 0\n1 1 A 0 0 2\n0 0 B B 0 0\nC C 0 0 F 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nNext, move 'B' down:\n- Move 'B' down.\n\nThe board now looks like this:\n```\nE 0 A D D 0\nE 0 A 0 0 0\n1 1 A 0 0 2\n0 0 0 B 0 0\nC C 0 B F 0\n0 0 0 B 0 0\n```\n\nNow, move 'A' to the left to clear the path for the key:\n- Move 'A' left.\n\nThe board now looks like this:\n```\nE 0 A D D 0\nE 0 0 A 0 0\n1 1 0 A 0 2\n0 0 0 B 0 0\nC C 0 B F 0\n0 0 0 B 0 0\n```\n\nFinally, move the key to the right to reach the exit:\n- Move '1' right.\n\nThe board now looks like this:\n```\nE 0 A D D 0\nE 0 0 A 0 0\n1 0 1 A 0 2\n0 0 0 B 0 0\nC C 0 B F 0\n0 0 0 B 0 0\n```\n\nSince we have reached the exit with the key, we don't need further moves.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","To solve this game, we need to move the key (1) to the exit (2) using the allowed movements for the blocks and the key.\n\nGiven the current state of the board:\n\n```\nE 0 A D D 0\nE 0 A 0 0 0\n1 1 A 0 0 2\n0 0 B B B 0\nC C 0 0 F 0\n0 0 0 0 F 0\n```\n\nOur objective is to clear a path from the key (1) to the exit (2) by moving the blocks out of the way. We can see that the key is currently blocked by the 'A' and 'B' blocks. Let's start by clearing the path:\n\n1. Move 'F' down to allow 'B' to move left.\n2. Move 'B' left to create space for 'A'.\n3. Move 'A' right to let the key move closer to the exit.\n\nLet's perform these actions:\n\n- First action: Move 'F' down.\n- Second action: Move 'B' left.\n- Third action: Move 'A' right.\n\nThese actions will allow the key to move towards the exit.\n\nAnswer: F down","To solve this problem, we need to move the key (1) to the exit (2) using the allowed movements for the blocks and the key.

The immediate obstacle is the 'A' block directly to the right of the key.\n\nFirst, we need to clear the path for the key by moving the 'A' block out of the way.

The 'A' block directly above the key can move left or right since there are no obstacles in those directions.

We can see that the 'A' blocks are directly to the right of the key, blocking its path. To clear this path, we might need to move the 'F' blocks down to provide more room for other movements.\n\nLet's start by moving the 'F' blocks down to create more space for the key to move:\n\n**Step 1:** Move 'F' down.\nThis will free up some space above the 'F' blocks.\n\nNext, we can attempt to move the 'C' block horizontally or vertically to further clear a path for the key.\n\n**Step 2:** Move 'C' right.\nThis could potentially create more space if the 'C' blocks are moved out of the way.\n\nAfter these steps, we would reassess the situation to determine the next best move for the key or other blocks.

However, since this is the 100th epoch and there hasn't been any previous movement or setup described, we need to assess if there's a feasible move for the key or any block that could lead to progress.\n\nAnalyzing the board:\n- The key (1) is blocked by blocks on all sides except the right side, but moving right directly into the exit isn't possible due to the block B.\n- Blocks can only move in their respective directions (horizontal blocks horizontally, vertical blocks vertically).\n- There are no immediate moves for the blocks that would create a path for the key to move towards the exit without additional steps that aren't outlined here.\n\nSince the key cannot move directly towards the exit due to the blocking arrangement and no other moves seem feasible given the constraints of the 100th epoch without prior context of movement, it seems the situation is at a standstill or an impasse based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No valid move"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.\"Answer: 1 right\".\nThe game contains horizontal and vertical blocks (represented by letters), a key (1), and an exit (2). Your goal is to move the blocks and the key to help the key reach the exit. Horizontal blocks can only move horizontally, vertical blocks can only move vertically, and the key can only move horizontally. Control the blocks and the key to make moves so that the key successfully reaches the exit on the right side.\nIn each turn, output the block\/key and its moving direction. For example, \"Answer: 1 right\" means moving the key one step to the right, and \"Answer: F up\" means moving the block labeled 'F' one step upward.\nRemember,the game will end at 100th epoch.\nCurrent epoch:101\nBoard:\n0 0 A 0 0 0\n0 0 A F F 0\n1 1 A 0 0 E\nC C C 0 0 E\nD 0 0 0 0 E\nD B B 0 0 0\n\n","epoch":101,"seed":19,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
