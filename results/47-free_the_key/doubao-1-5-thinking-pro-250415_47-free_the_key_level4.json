It can move right into row 3, columns 3-5 (since row 3, column 5 is empty), freeing up row 3, column 2.\n2. **Block A**: A is a vertical block in column 2, spanning rows 0-2. After moving B right, A can move downward step-by-step into the newly freed space (row 3, column 2, then row 4, column 2, and finally row 5, column 2). This movement eventually clears row 2, column 2, allowing the key to move right.\n\n### First Move (Epoch 1):\nThe critical first step is to move block B right to free up space below A. \n\nAnswer: B right","\nTo solve the problem, we need to move the key (1) to the exit (2) located at (2,5). The key is horizontal and can only move horizontally. The primary obstacle in row 2, column 2 is the vertical block A, which spans rows 0-2 in column 2. \n\n### Analysis:\n- **Block A**: A is a vertical block occupying (0,2), (1,2), and (2,2). Vertical blocks can only move vertically. Since moving up is impossible (row -1 is invalid), we check moving down. The cell directly below A at (3,2) is empty (row 3, column 2 is 0), so A can move down.\n- **Effect of moving A down**: Moving A down by one step will reposition A to (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2). This clears row 2, column 2, allowing the key to move right toward the exit.\n\n### Step:\nAt epoch 2, the first critical move is to clear the path for the key by moving block A down.\n\nAnswer: A down","\nTo solve the problem, we need to move the key (1) horizontally to reach the exit (2) in row 2, column 5. The key is currently blocked by the vertical block A at (2,2). The vertical block A occupies (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2). By moving A downward twice, we can clear the cell (2,2), allowing the key to proceed right toward the exit.\n\n### Step Analysis:\n1. **Block A is vertical** (occupies column 2, rows 1-3) and can only move vertically. To clear (2,2), we need to shift A downward.\n2. **First move (Epoch 3): Move A down**  \n   A initially occupies (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). Moving A down shifts it to (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) (since (4,2) is empty). This frees (1,2) but (2,2) remains occupied by A.\n3. **Subsequent moves (not required for this epoch)**: After moving A down again in a future epoch, A will occupy (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), freeing (2,2) entirely. This allows the key to move right through (2,2) toward the exit.\n\nFor the current epoch (3), the critical first step is to move A down to start clearing the path.\n\nAnswer: A down","\n\nTo move the key (1) to the exit (2) on the right, we need to clear the path in row 2.

The main obstacle is the vertical block 'A' occupying row 2, column 2. \n\nThe vertical block 'A' spans rows 2, 3, and 4 in column 2. To free up row 2, column 2, we can move 'A' downward. Moving 'A' down by 1 step will shift its positions to rows 3, 4, and 5 in column 2 (since row 5, column 2 is empty). This clears row 2, column 2, allowing the key to move right in subsequent steps.\n\nAnswer: A down","\nTo move the key (1) to the exit (2), we first observe the key's current position in row 2, columns 0-1. The exit is in row 2, column 5. The key can only move horizontally, and the cells between the key and the exit (row 2, columns 2-4) are empty (denoted by 0).

Since horizontal blocks (including the key) can only move horizontally, the key can move right if the cell immediately to the right of its rightmost part is empty. The key's rightmost part is at (2,2), and (2,3) is empty, so the key can move right to (2,2) and (2,3). \n\nNo vertical or horizontal blocks interfere with this movement, as the path to the right in row 2 is clear. \n\nAnswer: 1 right","\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to move the key (1) horizontally to reach the exit (2) located at position (2,5) on the board. \n\n### Analysis of the Board:\n- The key (1) is a horizontal block spanning positions (2,2) and (2,3) in row 2.\n- The exit (2) is at position (2,5) in row 2.\n- The cells between the key and the exit in row 2 are (2,4) (which is empty, denoted as 0) and (2,5) (the exit). \n\n### Movement Strategy:\nThe key can only move horizontally.

The key is a horizontal block restricted to moving horizontally, and the main obstacle is the vertical block A, which occupies row 2, column 4. \n\n### Analysis of Block A:\nBlock A is a vertical block spanning rows 0-2, column 4. Vertical blocks can only move up or down. Moving A up is impossible (would go out of bounds), but moving A down is feasible. Each downward move shifts A to the next row below. \n\n### Plan:\n1. Move A down repeatedly to clear row 2, column 4. After three downward moves, A will shift to rows 3-5, column 4, freeing row 2, column 4.

Initially, 'A' occupies (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). Moving 'A' down once shifts it to (2,4), (3,4), (4,4). Moving 'A' down again shifts it to (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), leaving row 2, column 4 empty.\n\n### First Step:\nThe immediate priority is to start moving 'A' down to clear the key's path. \n\nAnswer: A down","\nTo solve the problem, we need to move the key (horizontal, labeled '1') to the exit (labeled '2') in row 2, column 5.

This blocks the key's path to column 4 in row 2.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Move the vertical block 'A' down**: Since 'A' is a vertical block, it can only move vertically. The cell directly below the bottom of 'A' (row 5, column 4) is empty (0), so 'A' can move down.

The key is currently blocked by the vertical block 'A' in column 3 of row 2. To move 'A' out of the way, we first need to free up space below 'A' in column 3, which is blocked by the horizontal block 'C' in row 5, column 3. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Block 'E'**: 'E' is a vertical block in column 0, spanning rows 4 and 5. It can move upward since row 3, column 0 is empty.\n2. **Block 'C'**: 'C' is a horizontal block in row 5, spanning columns 1-3.

Vertical blocks can only move vertically (up\/down). Since moving up is impossible (out of bounds), 'A' must move down.\n2. **Path Clearance**: Moving 'A' down will shift its position, potentially freeing row 2, column 2 over multiple moves.

This blocks the key’s path at row 2, column 2.\n\n### Strategy:\nVertical blocks (like `A`) can only move vertically (up\/down). To clear the key’s path, `A` must be moved down twice. This will shift `A` from its original positions (rows 1-3, column 2) to rows 3-5, column 2, freeing row 2, column 2 for the key to pass through.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move `A` down once**: This shifts `A` from (row 1, column 2), (row 2, column 2), (row 3, column 2) to (row 2, column 2), (row 3, column 2), (row 4, column 2).

The main obstacle is the vertical block A at row 2, column 2, which blocks the key's path to the right. \n\n### Analysis of Blocks and Movement:\n- **Block A**: Vertical block spanning column 2, rows 0-2. Vertical blocks can only move up or down. A cannot move up (no space above row 0) and cannot move down because row 3, column 2 is occupied by block C (horizontal block in row 3, columns 1-3).\n- **Block C**: Horizontal block in row 3, columns 1-3. Horizontal blocks can only move left or right. Moving C left would shift it to row 3, columns 0-2, but this does not free up row 3, column 2 (still occupied by C). Moving C right shifts it to row 3, columns 2-4, also leaving row 3, column 2 occupied by C. Thus, C cannot free up space for A to move down.\n- **Key Movement**: The key can only move horizontally. To reach the exit, it needs to move right through row 2, columns 2-4. However, column 2 is blocked by A. Since A cannot move vertically and C cannot free up space for A, the key is initially blocked. \n\n### Critical Insight:\nThe key is a horizontal block spanning row 2, columns 0-1. To move right, the rightmost cell of the key (row 2, column 1) must move into an empty cell. The cell to the right (row 2, column 2) is occupied by A, but there are no other viable moves for blocks to clear A. Despite the blockage, the only possible move to progress is to attempt to move the key right, as no other blocks can be moved to clear the path.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","\nTo solve the problem, we need to move the key (1) horizontally to the exit (2) located at (2,5) in row 2. The key is currently blocked by the vertical block A at (2,2).

However, C is a horizontal block in row 3 (columns 1-3) and can only move left or right. Moving C right would shift it to columns 2-4, but this does not immediately free (3,2). \n\nAn alternative approach is to move the horizontal block F (row 1, columns 4-5) left, which creates space in row 1, column 5.

Moving C right frees up space in row 3, potentially allowing A to move down. \n\n### Strategy:\n- First, move block C right to shift its position from row 3, columns 1-3 to columns 2-4. This frees up row 3, column 1 and reduces the obstruction in column 2, row 3 (though C still occupies column 2 in row 3, this is a necessary step to create space for subsequent moves).\n\n### Move Execution:\nThe first critical move is to shift block C right, which helps reposition obstacles and paves the way for future adjustments to clear A from the key's path.\n\nAnswer: C right","\nTo solve the problem, we need to move the key (1) horizontally to the exit (2) in row 2.

Vertical blocks can only move vertically (up\/down). Since A is already at the top (row 0), it cannot move up. To clear the key’s path, A must move down into row 3, column 2.\n\n### Obstacle for A:\n- Row 3, column 2 is occupied by block C, a horizontal block (occupies row 3, columns 2-4).

To clear the key's path, 'A' must move down, but this requires the cell below (row 3, column 2) to be empty. \n- **Block 'C'**: Horizontal block in row 3, columns 2-4.

Moving 'C' right could free (3,2).\n\n### Strategy:\n- Move 'C' right to free (3,2), allowing 'A' to move down and clear (2,2) for the key.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move 'C' right**: 'C' is in row 3, columns 1-3. Moving right to columns 2-4 frees (3,1) and shifts 'C' away from (3,2), but (3,2) is still occupied by 'C'. However, this is a necessary first step to create space.\n\nAnswer: C right","\n\n\nTo determine the next move, we analyze the current board and rules. The key (1) is a horizontal block in row 2, columns 0-1, and needs to reach the exit (2) at row 2, column 5. The key can only move horizontally, but its path is blocked by the vertical block A at row 2, column 2. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Key's Path**: The key needs to move right through row 2, but (2,2) is occupied by the vertical block A.\n2. **Block A**: A is a vertical block spanning column 2 (rows 0-2). To clear (2,2) for the key, A must move down. However, A’s downward movement is blocked by the horizontal block C at row 3, column 2.\n3. **Block C**: C is a horizontal block in row 3, columns 2-4. To free up space for A, C must move left (since moving right is blocked by vertical block E at column 5). Moving C left creates space in row 3, column 4 but does not immediately free (3,2) (C still occupies (3,2) after moving left).\n\n### Next Move:\nGiven the urgency (epoch 95, 5 moves remaining), the most constructive step is to move C left to create incremental space, which may eventually allow A to move down in subsequent steps. \n\nAnswer: C left","\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to move the key (1) horizontally to reach the exit (2) at (2,5) within the remaining epochs (96-99). The key is currently at (2,0-1) and is blocked by the vertical block A at (2,2). Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Key Movement**: The key is a horizontal block and can only move left\/right. To reach the exit at (2,5), it needs to move right through (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), and (2,5).\n2. **Block A**: A is a vertical block spanning (0,2), (1,2), and (2,2). Vertical blocks can only move up\/down. Moving A up is impossible (out of bounds). Moving A down requires clearing (3,2), currently occupied by the horizontal block C.\n3. **Block C**: C is a horizontal block at (3,1-3). Moving C right to (3,2-4) frees (3,1) but not (3,2). Moving C left to (3,0-2) also keeps (3,2) occupied by C. Thus, C cannot clear (3,2) for A to move down.\n4. **Other Blocks**: F (horizontal, (1,3-4)), B (horizontal, (5,3-4)), D (vertical, (4-5,0)), and E (vertical, (3-5,5)) do not directly block the key's path and moving them does not clear A from (2,2).\n\n### Critical Insight:\nThe key is blocked by A at (2,2), and no blocks can be moved to clear A within the remaining epochs. However, the key must move right to reach the exit. Given the time constraints (4 epochs left), the only viable step is to move the key right immediately, even though A blocks (2,2). This assumes a potential oversight or that A can be shifted in subsequent steps, but based on the current board, moving the key right is the only progression.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","\nTo solve this problem, we need to move the key (1) to the exit (2) on the right side of the board within the remaining 3 epochs (epochs 98, 99, 100). The key can only move horizontally, and blocks can only move in their respective directions (horizontal blocks move left\/right, vertical blocks move up\/down). \n\n### Analysis of the Board:\n- **Key Position**: The key (1) is a horizontal block occupying cells (2,0) and (2,1) in row 2.\n- **Exit Position**: The exit (2) is at cell (2,5) in row 2.\n- **Obstacles**: The key’s path to the exit in row 2 is blocked by the vertical block A at cell (2,2). A spans columns 2 in rows 0, 1, and 2 (i.e., cells (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)), making it a vertical block that can only move up or down.\n- **Other Blocks**: \n  - C is a horizontal block in row 3 (cells (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)) and can move left\/right.\n  - F is a horizontal block in row 1 (cells (1,3), (1,4)) and can move left\/right.\n  - D is a vertical block in column 0 (cells (4,0), (5,0)) and can move up\/down.\n  - B is a horizontal block in row 5 (cells (5,3), (5,4)) and can move left\/right.\n  - E is a vertical block in column 5 (cells (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)) and can move up\/down.\n\n### Key Challenge:\nThe key cannot move right past A (cell (2,2)) unless A is moved. However, A is a vertical block and can only move up or down:\n- **Moving A up**: Impossible, as A is already in row 0 (top row).\n- **Moving A down**: Requires cell (3,2) (row 3, column 2) to be empty. Cell (3,2) is occupied by the horizontal block C, which can only move left\/right. Moving C right would free cell (3,3) but not (3,2), leaving A blocked.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe key’s path to the exit is blocked by A, and no valid moves of other blocks can clear this path within the remaining 3 epochs. Thus, the key cannot reach the exit in the remaining turns.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","\nTo determine how to move the key (1) to the exit (2) in the remaining two epochs (99 and 100), we analyze the board and constraints:\n\n### Board Structure and Key Constraints:\n- The key (1) is in row 2, columns 0 and 1 (horizontal, can only move left\/right).\n- The exit (2) is in row 2, column 5.\n- The path from the key to the exit in row 2 is blocked by the vertical block 'A' at (2,2). \n\n### Analysis of Block 'A':\n- 'A' is a vertical block spanning (0,2), (1,2), and (2,2). Vertical blocks can only move up or down.\n- Moving 'A' up is impossible (already at the top row).\n- Moving 'A' down is blocked by the horizontal block 'C' at (3,2). 'C' (row 3, columns 1-3) is horizontal and can only move left\/right, but even if 'C' moves, it does not free (3,2) for 'A' to move down.\n\n### Key Movement:\n- The key needs to move right through (2,2) to reach the exit. However, (2,2) is occupied by 'A', which cannot be moved. \n- The key is blocked and cannot move right in the current configuration.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWith only two epochs remaining, and no way to move 'A' to clear the path, the key cannot reach the exit. However, the problem requires a move, so the only possible action (even if blocked) is to attempt moving the key right.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","\nTo solve this problem, we need to move the key (represented by '1') to the exit (represented by '2') on the game board within the remaining epoch (epoch 99). The key can only move horizontally, and blocks (labeled with letters) have movement restrictions: horizontal blocks move horizontally, and vertical blocks move vertically.\n\n### Analysis of the Board:\n- **Key Position**: The key is a horizontal block occupying cells (2,0) and (2,1) in row 2 (0-indexed).\n- **Exit Position**: The exit is at cell (2,5) in row 2.\n- **Blocking Block (A)**: A vertical block labeled 'A' occupies cells (0,2), (1,2), and (2,2). This block blocks the key's direct path to the exit in row 2, column 2.\n\n### Movement Constraints:\n- **Key Movement**: The key can only move horizontally (left or right). To reach the exit, it needs to move right through row 2.\n- **Block A**: As a vertical block, 'A' can only move up or down. However, moving up is impossible (out of bounds), and moving down is blocked by the horizontal block 'C' in row 3, column 2. Thus, 'A' is fixed and cannot clear the path.\n\n### Critical Observation:\nThe key is in row 2, and the exit is also in row 2. The only obstacle is block 'A' at (2,2). Since 'A' cannot move, the key must move right directly. Even though 'A' blocks (2,2), the key's goal is to reach the exit at (2,5). Given the game ends at epoch 100, the final move must attempt to move the key right, as no other blocks can be moved to clear the path in one step.\n\nAnswer: 1 right","\nThe game is at epoch 100, the final turn. The key (1) is located in row 2, columns 0-1, and the exit (2) is in row 2, column 5. The key can only move horizontally, but its path to the exit in row 2 is blocked by the vertical block A at (2,2). \n\nA is a vertical block occupying (0,2), (1,2), and (2,2). Vertical blocks can only move vertically, but A cannot move up (no space above row 0) or down (blocked by the horizontal block C at (3,2)). Other blocks (F, C, D, B, E) either cannot be moved to free A’s position or do not impact the key’s path. Since the key cannot move past A to reach the exit by the 100th epoch, no valid move can complete the goal.\n\nAnswer: no move"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
