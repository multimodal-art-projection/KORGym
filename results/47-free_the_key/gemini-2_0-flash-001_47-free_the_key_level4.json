I need to analyze the board, figure out the best move to get the key (1) closer to the exit (2), and then output the move in the specified format.\n\nHere's my thought process for epoch 2:\n\n1. **Analyze the board:** The key (1) is currently blocked by the 'C' blocks. The exit (2) is on the rightmost side of the third row. The 'A' blocks are also blocking.\n\n2. **Possible moves:** I need to move the 'C' blocks out of the way so the key can move to the right. The 'C' blocks are vertical, so they can move up or down.\n\n3. **Choose the best move:** Moving the 'C' blocks up seems to be the most promising move. If I move them up far enough, the key can move freely to the right.\n\n4. **Output the move:** I will move the C blocks up one step.\n\nAnswer: C up\n","Okay, I understand the game and the rules.

I will consider whether moving a blocking block will create other issues.\n3.  **Avoid Deadlocks:**  I will try to avoid moves that create situations where blocks are boxed in, preventing the key or other necessary blocks from moving.\n4. **Efficiency:** I will try to achieve the goal in the fewest moves possible.\n\n**Current Board Analysis (Epoch 56):**\n\n*   **Key Position:** The key (1) is currently at (2,1) and (2,2).\n*   **Exit Position:** The exit (2) is at (2,5).\n*   **Obstacles:** The key is blocked by the 'A' block. To move to the right, A must move up or down. Moving A down seems more promising because the blocks below 'A' are 'E' and 'C', which potentially can be moved easier.\n\n**Action (Epoch 56):**\n\nBased on the analysis, I will move block 'A' down.\n\n**Output:**\n\nAnswer: A down\n","","Okay, I understand the game.

Since it's the last epoch, I need to get the key to the exit in a single move if possible. The 'A' block is preventing the key from moving right. I would need to move the A block up to move the key to the exit. But since it is the 100th epoch, even if I output \"A up\", A cannot be moved up successfully. So, the key cannot reach the exit at the 100th epoch.\nIf it's the last move, the possible moves can't make the key reach the exit. Since it is the 100th epoch. We should move as close as possible. I'll attempt to move the key to be closer to the exit.\nAnswer: 1 right"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.\"Answer: 1 right\".\nThe game contains horizontal and vertical blocks (represented by letters), a key (1), and an exit (2). Your goal is to move the blocks and the key to help the key reach the exit.

Therefore the 'E' blocks need to move to the right first, freeing up the space for block A to move up.\n\nHere's a possible sequence of moves:\n\n1.  E right\n2.  E right\n3.  A up\n4.

Move the key to the right.\n2.  Try to move block 'A' up.\n3.  Try to move block 'E' down.\n4.  Try to move block 'B' down.\n5.  Try to move block 'F' up.\n\nHere are my moves for the remaining epochs:\n\nEpoch 94: 1 right\nEpoch 95: 1 right\nEpoch 96: A up\nEpoch 97: E down\nEpoch 98: B down\nEpoch 99: F up\nEpoch 100: A up\n\nAnswer: A up","Okay, I understand the game. Let's analyze the current board state and devise a plan to get the key (1) to the exit (2).\n\nCurrent Board:\n```\n0 0 0 A 0 0\n0 0 0 A 0 0\n0 1 1 A 0 2\nD 0 E E E C\nD F 0 0 B C\n0 F 0 0 B C\n```\n\nThe key (1) is currently located at (2,1) and (2,2)\nThe exit (2) is at (2,5).\nWe need to move the key three steps to the right. The block 'A' is currently blocking the key.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Move 'A' up to create a path for the key. Since epoch is 94, there's not enough steps for block 'A' to move upward.\n\nSince we cannot move 'A' anymore, the key is trapped, and we cannot reach exit 2. Let's try moving key to right.\n\n1 right\n\n```\n0 0 0 A 0 0\n0 0 0 A 0 0\n0 0 1 A 1 2\nD 0 E E E C\nD F 0 0 B C\n0 F 0 0 B C\n```\n\n1 right\n\n```\n0 0 0 A 0 0\n0 0 0 A 0 0\n0 0 0 A 1 2\nD 0 E E E C\nD F 0 0 B C\n0 F 0 0 B C\n```\n\nIt seems that since the block 'A' is blocking the path, the key cannot reach the exit, and moving the key will not work in the long term. Since we have reached epoch 96, and we have not devised any other method. I will just move 'A' up.\n\nA up\n\nAnswer: A up\n","Okay, I understand the game.

Control the blocks and the key to make moves so that the key successfully reaches the exit on the right side.\nIn each turn, output the block\/key and its moving direction. For example, \"Answer: 1 right\" means moving the key one step to the right, and \"Answer: F up\" means moving the block labeled 'F' one step upward.\nRemember,the game will end at 100th epoch.\nCurrent epoch:101\nBoard:\nD D D 0 A 0\nE E 0 0 A 0\n0 0 1 1 A 2\n0 0 F F 0 0\nB 0 0 0 0 0\nB C C C 0 0\n\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

However, I can attempt to improve the key's position. I will prioritize moving the key to the right.\n\n**Turn 99:**\n\nMove the key (1) one step to the right.\n\n**Turn 100:**\n\nMove the key (1) one step to the right.\n\nAnswer: 1 right\n","Okay, I understand the game.

I need to move the key right to reach the exit. However, the block 'A' is in the way. I need to move 'A' up, but it's blocked. Therefore, I'll make a move that will help to move the key to the exit in the next epoch.\n\nMove 'A' up:\nSince it is blocked I will make a different move to allow for the key to move right on the next turn. This means 'D' should move down if it is possible.\n\nSince 'D' is a vertical block, I can move it down if the space is available.\n\nMove 'D' down\n\nAnswer: D down\n",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.\"Answer: 1 right\".\nThe game contains horizontal and vertical blocks (represented by letters), a key (1), and an exit (2). Your goal is to move the blocks and the key to help the key reach the exit. Horizontal blocks can only move horizontally, vertical blocks can only move vertically, and the key can only move horizontally. Control the blocks and the key to make moves so that the key successfully reaches the exit on the right side.\nIn each turn, output the block\/key and its moving direction. For example, \"Answer: 1 right\" means moving the key one step to the right, and \"Answer: F up\" means moving the block labeled 'F' one step upward.\nRemember,the game will end at 100th epoch.\nCurrent epoch:101\nBoard:\n0 0 F F A 0\nB B 0 0 A 0\n0 0 1 1 A 0\n0 C C 0 0 D\n0 0 0 0 0 D\n0 E E E 0 D\n\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

I need to move the blocks and the key (1) to get the key to the exit (2 - which doesn't explicitly appear but is implied to be on the right edge). Let's analyze the board and plan a series of moves.\n\nHere's the current board state:\n\n```\n0 0 A 0 0 0\n0 0 A 0 F F\n1 1 A 0 0 E\nC C C 0 0 E\nD 0 0 0 0 E\nD 0 0 B B 0\n```\n\nMy immediate goal is to clear a path for the key to move to the right. Given that the key can only move horizontally and we are at epoch 96, I have limited moves. Let's try moving 'C' down, 'D' down then moving key right.\n\nHere's the sequence of moves:\n\n1. C down\n2. D down\n3. 1 right\n4. 1 right\n\nLet's execute the plan:\n\n```\nAnswer: C down\n```","Okay, I understand the game. My goal is to move the key (1) to the exit (2), which doesn't exist in the current board. Since there's no exit, I will try to move the key as far right as possible within the move limit.\n\nEpoch 97:\n\n1.  Move C down\n\nAnswer: C down\n","Okay, I understand the game.

The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.\"Answer: 1 right\".\nThe game contains horizontal and vertical blocks (represented by letters), a key (1), and an exit (2). Your goal is to move the blocks and the key to help the key reach the exit. Horizontal blocks can only move horizontally, vertical blocks can only move vertically, and the key can only move horizontally. Control the blocks and the key to make moves so that the key successfully reaches the exit on the right side.\nIn each turn, output the block\/key and its moving direction. For example, \"Answer: 1 right\" means moving the key one step to the right, and \"Answer: F up\" means moving the block labeled 'F' one step upward.\nRemember,the game will end at 100th epoch.\nCurrent epoch:101\nBoard:\n0 0 A 0 0 0\n0 0 A 0 F F\n1 1 A 0 0 E\nC C C 0 0 E\nD 0 0 0 0 E\nD 0 0 B B 0\n\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
