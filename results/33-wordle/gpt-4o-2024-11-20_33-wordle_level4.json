The letter `a` is in the word but **not at index 6**.\n\n### Strategy for Choosing the Next Word:\nLooking at the patterns, we need a **location-based** word with 11 characters that:\n- Places `i` at index 8.\n- Incorporates `e`, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `a` in other positions while respecting their misplaced indices.\n- Avoids the letters `d`, `s`, and `o`.\n\nBased on the clues, I propose the word **\"imagination\"**, which matches the criteria.\n\n### Explanation:\n- `i` occurs at index 8 (correct position).\n- `e`, `t`, `n`, `a` all appear in the word.\n- No `d`, `s`, or `o` present.\n  \n### Answer:\nAnswer: imagination","Based on the feedback provided for the two guesses, let us analyze the information:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **From Attempt 1 (\"destination\"):**\n   - Letter `d` is not in the word at all.\n   - Letter `e` is in the word but in the wrong spot.\n   - Letter `s` is not in the word at all.\n   - Letter `t` is in the word and in the wrong spot (appears multiple times as wrong spot).\n   - Letter `i` is in the word, and at idx=8, it is in the correct spot.\n   - Letter `n` is in the word but in the wrong spot (appears multiple times as wrong spot).\n   - Letter `a` is in the word but in the wrong spot.\n   - Letter `o` is not in the word at all.\n\n2. **From Attempt 2 (\"imagination\"):**\n   - Letter `i` at idx=8 is confirmed in its correct position.\n   - Letter `m` is not in the word at all.\n   - Letter `a`, `g`, and `t` are in the word but in the wrong spot.\n   - Letter `n` remains in the word but in the wrong spot.\n   - Letter `o` is again confirmed as not in the word at all.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:\nThe word should:\n- Be 11 letters long.\n- Include the letters `e`, `t`, `i` (already correct position at idx=8), `n`, `a`, and `g`.\n- Exclude the letters `d`, `s`, `o`, and `m`.\n- Place `i` at idx=8.\n- Rearrange `e`, `t`, `a`, `n`, and `g` in valid positions, avoiding incorrect placements from previous guesses.\n\n### Candidate Word:\nA word fitting the criteria can be: **\"integration\".**\n- `i` is at idx=8 (confirmed correct position).\n- Contains `e`, `t`, `a`, `n`, and `g` in possible valid positions.\n- Excludes `d`, `s`, `o`, and `m`.\n- All conditions for feedback are satisfied.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: integration","Based on the rules and history provided, here is the reasoning for the next guess:\n\n### Summary of observations:\n1. The word does not contain the letters: d, s, m, o.\n2. The letter `i` is in the word but not at indices 0, 4, or 1. It is confirmed valid at index 8.\n3. The letter `e` is confirmed valid at index 3.\n4. The letter `n` is in the word but not at indices 1, 5, or 10.\n5. The letter `t` is in the word but not at indices 2, 7, or 3.\n6. The letter `g` is in the word but not at index 4.\n7. The letter `r` is in the word but not at index 5.\n8. The letter `a` is in the word but not at indices 2, 6, or 5.\n\n### Forming a logical guess:\nWe're looking for a location-based word with 11 letters. Based on analysis, the correct structure appears to be as follows:\n- The letter `e` is fixed at index 3.\n- The letter `i` is fixed at index 8.\n- Other letters must be rearranged considering feedback from previous guesses and the history.\n\n### Next guess:\nThe next word guess is **\"generation\"**. This fits the feedback rules so far and matches the location theme.\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: generation","### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\nWe are tasked with identifying an 11-letter word based on the feedback provided for previous guesses. Let's analyze the history and compile clues systematically.\n\n#### Information Deduction:\n1. **Occupied and Correct Positions:**\n   - `idx=3` must be `e`.  \n   - `idx=8` must be `i`.  \n   - `idx=9` must be `n`.\n\n2. **Excluded Letters:**\n   - `o` (from all spots in all guesses).  \n   - `m` (from all spots in Guess 2).  \n   - `s` (from Guess 1).  \n   - `d` (from Guess 1).  \n   - `-` (from Guess 4).  \n\n3. **In-the-Word but Incorrect Positions:**\n   - `a, i, e, t, g, n, r`: These letters must appear **somewhere**, but in positions that were marked \"wrong spot\".\n     - `a` appears in multiple guesses (`idx=2, 6`).  \n     - `i` appears multiple times but is locked into position `8`.\n     - `n` was marked in an incorrect position consistently from `idx=1, 2, 5`.  \n     - `e` cannot be in positions `idx=1` or others already guessed wrongly.\n   - `r` (\"wrong spot\" in `idx=5` in Guesses 3 and 4).\n\n4. **Valid Positions to Fill:**\n   Using current findings:  \n   - `idx=3` is `e`.  \n   - `idx=8` is `i`.  \n   - `idx=9` is `n`.  \n   - Remaining positions: `idx=0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7`.\n\nLet's hypothesize and validate a word that fits all the criteria.\n\n---\n\n### Hypothesis:\nA plausible word that satisfies all constraints (letters in correct spots, wrong spots, and absent letters) is **\"terminating\"**.\n\n#### Justification:\n1. Does the word fit the feedback?  \n   - `idx=3` is `e` ✅.  \n   - `idx=8` is `i` ✅.  \n   - `idx=9` is `n` ✅.  \n2. Excluded letters (`o, s, d, m, -`) are absent. ✅  \n3. All letters \"in the word but wrong spots\" (`a, i, e, t, g, n, r`) are present:  \n   - `a` is in `idx=6`. ✅  \n   - `t` is in `idx=0`. ✅  \n   - `g` is in `idx=10`. ✅  \n   - `r` is in `idx=1`. ✅  \n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: terminating","To determine the next guess based on the feedback provided, let's summarize the information:\n\n### Positional Analysis:\n1. The letters confirmed in their correct spots are:\n   - **t** at idx=0\n   - **r** at idx=2\n   - **e** at idx=3\n   - **i** at idx=8\n   - **n** at idx=9\n   - **g** at idx=10\n\n2. The letters that are in the word but currently in the wrong spots are:\n   - **e**\n   - **i**\n   - **n**\n   - **a**\n   - **t**\n   - **g**\n\n3. Letters that are **not in the word**:\n   - **d** (idx=0 in Guess 1)\n   - **s** (idx=2 in Guess 1)\n   - **m** (idx=1 in Guess 2)\n   - **o** (idx=9 in Guess 1 and Guess 2)\n   - **-** (idx=10 in Guess 4)\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\nWe need to use the confirmed positions of letters while rearranging the misplaced letters into new positions to complete a valid word. The word must use all confirmed and possible letters without violating feedback.\n\n### Possible Guess:\nLooking at the pattern and feedback, a word that fits **\"t at idx=0, r at idx=2, e at idx=3, i at idx=8, n at idx=9, g at idx=10\"** while rearranging the other misplaced letters could be **\"trendsetting\"** (a location-related word).\n\n### Final Output:\nAnswer: trendsetting","Let's analyze the feedback from the guesses and identify letters we know for certain and their positions:\n\n### Confirmed Letters:\n1. **t** at index 0 (from guess 5 and 6).\n2. **e** at index 3 (from guess 3, 4, 5, and 6).\n3. **i** at index 8 (from all guesses starting from guess 1).\n4. **n** at index 9 (from guess 4, 5, and 6).\n5. **g** at index 10 (from guess 5).\n\n### Letters in the word but wrong positions:\n- **e** is in the word at least twice, as feedback indicates it at idx=1 and elsewhere.\n- **r** is in the word (feedback for idx=2 and idx=1).\n- **n** (feedback shows multiple occurrences but in wrong spots).\n- **a** (feedback shows multiple occurrences but in wrong spots).\n- **t** appears in multiple positions but often in the wrong spot.\n- **i**, **g**, and **n** have been clarified as correct positions.\n\n### Letters not in the word:\n- **d**, **o**, **m**, **s**, and **-** are not part of the word.\n\n### Hypothesis based on feedback:\nThe word starts with \"t\", contains \"r\", \"e\", \"n\", \"a\", and \"t\", alongside confirmed placements.

From Attempt 1 (\"star\"):\n   - **s** (idx=0): In the word but wrong spot → Cannot be at index 0.\n   - **t** (idx=1): Not in the word → Cannot be in the word at all.\n   - **a** (idx=2): In the word but wrong spot → Cannot be at index 2.\n   - **r** (idx=3): Not in the word → Cannot be in the word at all.\n\n2. From Attempt 2 (\"maps\"):\n   - **m** (idx=0): In the word and the correct spot → Must be at index 0.\n   - **a** (idx=1): In the word but wrong spot → Cannot be at index 1.\n   - **p** (idx=2): Not in the word → Cannot be in the word at all.\n   - **s** (idx=3): In the word but wrong spot → Cannot be at index 3.\n\n### Observations:\n- **m** is fixed at idx=0.\n- **a**, **s**, and **s** must exist in the word, but their exact positions need analysis:\n  - **a**: Cannot be idx=1 or idx=2.\n  - **s**: Cannot be idx=0 or idx=3.\n- Letters **t**, **r**, and **p** are excluded entirely.\n\n### Analysis:\nConsidering these constraints, a valid word could be **mass**:\n- **m** at idx=0 is correct.\n- **a** at idx=1 is incorrect but could be placed at idx=2.\n- **s** fits at idx=1 or idx=3.\n\nFinal word satisfying these rules is **mast**:\n- **m** fixed at idx=0.\n- **a** satisfies the constraint.\n- **s** correctly fits the history feedback.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: mast","Based on the provided History and Feedback, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. From the first guess \"star\":\n   - \"s\" is in the word but not at index 0.\n   - \"t\" is not in the word at all.\n   - \"a\" is in the word but not at index 2.\n   - \"r\" is not in the word at all.\n\n2. From the second guess \"maps\":\n   - \"m\" at index 0 is correct.\n   - \"a\" is in the word but not at index 1.\n   - \"p\" is not in the word.\n   - \"s\" is in the word but not at index 3.\n\n3. From the third guess \"mast\":\n   - \"m\" at index 0 is correct.\n   - \"a\" is in the word but not at index 1.\n   - \"s\" at index 2 is correct.\n   - \"t\" is not in the word.\n\n### Deduction:\n\nFrom the second and third guesses, \"m\" and \"s\" are fixed at index 0 and 2 respectively. The remaining letters at index 1 and index 3 need to be filled with a combination of \"a\" and \"s\" in locations where they are not ruled out.\n\nAt index 1:\n- \"a\" is confirmed to be in the word but is not at index 1 based on the second and third guesses, so the letter at this index cannot be \"a.\"\n\nAt index 3:\n- \"s\" cannot be at index 3 based on the second guess (\"maps\").\n\nLik goog image! Thanks","","Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step and deduce the next possible guess:\n\n### Known Information:\n1. **Guess 1: \"star\"**\n   - `s` (idx=0): In the word, wrong spot.\n   - `t` (idx=1): Not in the word at all.\n   - `a` (idx=2): In the word, wrong spot.\n   - `r` (idx=3): Not in the word at all.\n\n2. **Guess 2: \"maps\"**\n   - `m` (idx=0): Correct spot.\n   - `a` (idx=1): In the word, wrong spot.\n   - `p` (idx=2): Not in the word at all.\n   - `s` (idx=3): In the word, wrong spot.\n\n3. **Guess 3: \"mast\"**\n   - `m` (idx=0): Correct spot.\n   - `a` (idx=1): In the word, wrong spot.\n   - `s` (idx=2): Correct spot.\n   - `t` (idx=3): Not in the word at all.\n\n4. **Guess 4 & 5: No feedback provided with \"----\".**\n\n### Deductions:\n- The word starts with `m` (idx=0) and has `s` at idx=2.\n- `a` must be either at idx=3 (since idx=1 and idx=2 are incorrect for it).\n- `t`, `r`, `p` are definitely not in the word.\n- `s` cannot be at idx=0 or idx=3 because it was guessed wrong for those positions in previous attempts.\n- No repeat letters are mentioned, but `a` and `s` existing more than once can be ruled out based on feedback so far.\n\n### Possible Solution:\nConsidering all this, let’s try the word **\"mask\"**, as it fits the criteria.\n\n### Final Output:\nAnswer: mask","Let's solve this!\n\n### Step-by-step deduction:\n1. From Guess 1 (\"star\"):  \n   - `s`: In the word but wrong spot.  \n   - `t`: Not in the word.  \n   - `a`: In the word but wrong spot.  \n   - `r`: Not in the word.  \n\n2. From Guess 2 (\"maps\"):  \n   - `m`: In the word and in the correct spot (`idx=0`).  \n   - `a`: In the word but wrong spot.  \n   - `p`: Not in the word.  \n   - `s`: In the word but wrong spot.  \n\n3. From Guess 3 (\"mast\"):  \n   - `m`: In the word and in the correct spot (`idx=0`).  \n   - `a`: In the word but wrong spot.  \n   - `s`: In the word and in the correct spot (`idx=2`).  \n   - `t`: Not in the word.  \n\n4.

From Guess 6 (\"mask\"):  \n   - `m`: In the word and in the correct spot (`idx=0`).  \n   - `a`: In the word but wrong spot.  \n   - `s`: In the word and in the correct spot (`idx=2`).  \n   - `k`: Not in the word.  \n\n### Conclusions:\n   - The first letter is `m`.  \n   - The second letter is not `a` but `a` is somewhere else.  \n   - The third letter is `s`.  \n   - The fourth letter is not `r`, `t`, `k`, or `p`.  \n\nThe possible word could be \"mash\" (since `m` is correct, `a` fits as the second letter, `s` fits as the third letter, and `h` is a valid option for the fourth letter).\n\n### Final Answer:  \nAnswer: mash","To deduce the correct word based on the provided history and rules, let's summarize:\n\n### Observations from History:\n1. The first letter is **m** (it's confirmed at `idx=0` in multiple guesses).\n2. The second letter is **a**, but it's **in the wrong spot** each time—this indicates it cannot be at `idx=1` (so it should move to `idx=3` or `idx=2`).\n3. The third letter is **s** (confirmed as correct at `idx=2`).\n4. The fourth letter must be **a** (since **a** is in the wrong spot at `idx=1` in all guesses and works at `idx=3`).\n\n### Valid Word Construction:\nIf we fit all observations, the word should look like: **mesa**.\n\n### Verification of \"mesa\":\n1. **m** at `idx=0` ✅ (correct spot from guesses 2–7).\n2. **e** at `idx=1` (not explicitly ruled in\/out; fits and substitutes the eliminated letters).\n3. **s** at `idx=2` ✅ (correct spot from guesses 3–7).\n4. **a** at `idx=3` ✅ (correct spot based on guess patterns).\n\nThus, the valid word is **mesa**.\n\n### Final Output:\nAnswer: mesa"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

I will begin by making a guess for a seven-letter location-based word.\n\nMy guess for this round is: 'airport'\n\nAnswer: airport","Based on the feedback provided, here’s what we know so far:\n\n1. The word does **not** contain the letters **a, i, r, p, o** in **any position**.\n2. The letter **t** is in the word but in the **wrong position**.\n3. The word is 7 letters long.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Form a valid 7-letter word omitting the letters **a, i, r, p, o**.\n- Include the letter **t**, but place it in a position other than index 6.\n\n### Possible guess:\nA word that fits the criteria is **mantles**. It avoids the excluded letters and includes the letter **t** at index 3 (not 6).\n\n### Output:\nAnswer: mantles","Based on the feedback provided in the history:\n\n### Analysis:\n1. From the first guess, **airport**:\n   - The letters **a**, **i**, **r**, **p**, **o**, **r**, and **t** (at idx=6) are ruled out from certain positions (e.g., **idx=6**) or entirely.\n\n2. From the second guess, **mantles**:\n   - The letters **m**, **a**, **n**, and **s** are confirmed NOT in the word.\n   - **t** is in the correct position at **idx=3**.\n   - **l** and **e** are in the word but in the WRONG positions.\n\n### Constraints:\n- The word is 7 letters long.\n- The letter **t** must be at **idx=3** (4th position).\n- The letters **l** and **e** must appear in the word but NOT at **idx=4** or **idx=5**, respectively.\n- The letters **a**, **i**, **r**, **p**, **o**, **m**, **n**, and **s** are not in the word.\n\n### Possible Letter Pool:\n- Letters that haven't been excluded yet: **b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, q, u, v, w, x, y, z.**\n\n### Making a Guess:\nBased on the above constraints, one potential guess could be **bucket**:\n- **b**, **u**, and **c** fall within allowed letters.\n- **l** and **e** (to satisfy their inclusion) do not directly appear in this guess but might need testing constraintsverification!\ntestingdto appearfamework","Based on the game board's rules and history, here's how we analyze the information:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **From Guess 1 (airport):** \n  - Letters 'a', 'i', 'r', 'p', 'o', 'r' (again) are **not in the word at all.**\n  - The letter 't' is in the word but **not at idx=6.**\n\n- **From Guess 2 (mantles):** \n  - Letters 'm', 'a', 'n', 's' are **not in the word at all.**\n  - The letter 't' is **correct at idx=3.**\n  - The letter 'l' is in the word but **not at idx=4.**\n  - The letter 'e' is in the word but **not at idx=5.**\n\n- **From Guess 3 (-------):** \n  - This \"guess\" doesn't provide new information directly, likely an invalid entry or placeholder.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the rules and hints, the word must:\n1. Have **t at idx=3.**\n2. Include **l (not at idx=4)** and **e (not at idx=5).**\n3. Exclude letters: 'a', 'i', 'r', 'p', 'o', 'm', 'n', 's'.\n\n### Possible word:\nUsing logic and available letters, the word could be **\"settler\"** because:\n- 't' is at index 3.\n- 'l' is in the word (at index 5).\n- 'e' is in the word (at index 4).\n- All excluded letters are avoided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Output:\nAnswer: settler","Based on the prior guesses and feedback, here's the analysis of the correct word:\n\n### Key insights:\n1. From Guess 1 (`airport`), none of the letters in \"airport\" are in the word except `t`, which is in the word but not at index 6.\n2. From Guess 2 (`mantles`):\n   - `m`, `a`, `n`, and `s` are not in the word at all.\n   - `t` is correctly placed at index 3.\n   - `l` and `e` are in the word but in the wrong spots.\n3. From Guess 3 (`-------`), the feedback is irrelevant to this puzzle.\n4. From Guess 4 (`settler`):\n   - `s`, `r` are confirmed not in the word.\n   - `e` at index 1 is correct, `t` at indices 2 and 3 are correct.\n   - `l` and `e` exist but are misplaced.\n\n### Constraints determined so far:\n- The word starts with `e` at idx=1 (second position).\n- The word has `t` correctly placed at indices 2 and 3.\n- The word contains `l` somewhere other than idx=4.\n- The word contains `e` somewhere other than idx=1 and idx=5.\n- Length of the word is 7.\n\n### Possible guess:\nA word fitting all these constraints is **\"letters\"**.\n\n---\n\n### My guess:\nAnswer: letters","Let's analyze the information given:\n\n1. The word is 7 letters long.\n2. Results from feedback:\n   - The correct letters and positions are:\n     - \"l\" at idx=0\n     - \"e\" at idx=1\n     - \"t\" at idx=2\n     - \"t\" at idx=3\n   - The letter \"e\" is in the word but incorrectly placed at idx=4; it must appear elsewhere in the word (but not at idx=5 or idx=6).\n   - The letter \"l\" is in the word but incorrectly placed at idx=4, meaning it must appear elsewhere in the word (but not at idx=5 or idx=6).\n   - Letters eliminated completely: a, i, r, p, o, m, n, s.\n   - At idx=4, the correct letter is not \"e\" or \"l.\"\n\n3. Constructing the word:\n   - Since \"letters\" from Guess #5 was close to correct, refine the word by ensuring the above rules are followed.\n   - Potentially complete positions are: \"lett__.\"\n\nMy guess for this round: **letter**.\n\nAnswer: letter","From the feedback provided, we can refine and deduce the final word:\n\n### Observations:\n- Based on Guess 5 (`letters`):\n  - `l` is correct at `idx=0`.\n  - `e` is correct at `idx=1`.\n  - `t` is correct at `idx=2` and `idx=3`.\n  - `e` appears elsewhere in the word but not at `idx=4`.\n  - `r` is not in the word at any spot.\n  - `s` is not in the word at any spot.\n  \n- Based on Guess 6 (`letter-`):\n  - Same findings as Guess 5, but `-` is also confirmed not to be part of the word.\n\n### Known structure:\nThe word takes the form:\n`l e t t _ e _`\n\n### Remaining:\nFrom Guess 5 and Guess 6, the feedback indicates that:\n- `e` must appear either at `idx=5` or `idx=6`.\n- No other letters from the history are plausible.\n\n### Final answer:\nThe correct word that fits all feedback is: **lettered**.\n\nAnswer: lettered","Let's analyze the history to deduce the solution:\n\n1. Clues that are confirmed:\n   - The word is of length 7.\n   - Position mappings:\n      - `l` is correct at idx=0.\n      - `e` is correct at idx=1.\n      - `t` is correct at idx=2.\n      - `t` is correct at idx=3.\n      - `e` is misplaced at idx=4.\n      - `e` is correct at idx=6.\n\n2. Elimination based on feedback:\n   - Letters excluded: `a, i, r, p, o, n, m, s, -, r`.\n   - The misplaced `e` at idx=4 means there is an additional `e` in the word, beyond idx=1 and idx=6.\n   - The misplaced `l` implies there’s only one letter `l` (already fixed at idx=0).\n   - The final position of `e` at idx=4 must be substituted elsewhere.\n\n3. Logical placement:\n   - The word must adhere to all the feedback.\n   - Using the structure `lett....e`, we determined the following plausible candidate: **lettere** is not final likely!","### Analysis:\nFrom the provided feedback:\n1. The word is 7 letters long.\n2. The history reveals the current confirmed correct structure is:\n   - `l` at **idx=0** is correct.\n   - `e` at **idx=1** is correct.\n   - `t` at **idx=2** is correct.\n   - `t` at **idx=3** is correct.\n   - **idx=6** has `e` in the correct spot.\n   - There's also feedback that suggests `e` and `l` appear elsewhere:\n     - `l` is in the word, but incorrect at **idx=4**.\n     - `e` is in the word, but incorrect at **idx=4** and **idx=5**.\n   - The rest of the history eliminates letters like `a`, `i`, `o`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `r`.\n\n### Candidate Word Construction:\nThe correct structure identified so far is:\n**l e t t _ _ e**\n\n- We deduce the missing letters at **idx=4** and **idx=5** must include:\n   - `l` from feedback (wrong at idx=4, so it should fit on idx=5).\n   - Letters remaining from valid feedback suggest duplicating `e` for idx=4.\n\n### Best Guess for Attempt 9:\n**Guess: lettuce**\n\n### Final Output:\nAnswer: lettuce"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Since this is the first attempt and no information has yet been provided, I'll start with a broad guess based on an 11-letter word, and we'll refine the guesses in subsequent rounds based on the feedback you provide.\n\nI'll start with the guess: \"springtime\".\n\nAnswer: springtime","Based on the information given, we have the following clues:\n\n1. **Idx=0**: `s` is not in the word at all.\n2. **Idx=1**: `p` is not in the word at all.\n3. **Idx=2**: `r` is in the word but in the wrong spot.\n4. **Idx=3**: `i` is not in the word at all.\n5. **Idx=4**: `n` is in the word but in the wrong spot.\n6. **Idx=5**: `g` is not in the word at all.\n7. **Idx=6**: `t` is in the word but in the wrong spot.\n8. **Idx=7**: `i` is not in the word at all.\n9. **Idx=8**: `m` is not in the word at all.\n10. **Idx=9**: `e` is in the word but in the wrong spot.\n11. **Idx=10**: `-` is not in the word at all.\n\nThe word must be 11 letters long, and the following deductions can be made:\n\n- The word doesn’t contain `s`, `p`, `i`, `g`, `m`, or `-`.\n- The word contains `r`, `n`, `t`, and `e`, but none of these are in the correct spots as per Guess 1.\n- Using this feedback, the word must rearrange `r`, `n`, `t`, and `e`, and potentially utilize other letters not present in Guess 1.\n\nBased on the clues and the positional requirements, I will guess a word that fits these constraints.\n\n**Second Attempt Guess**: \"northeast\"  \nExplanation:\n- \"northeast\" fits the length requirement (11 letters).\n- It contains `r`, `n`, `t`, and `e` in new positions.\n- Other letters (`o`, `h`, `a`, etc.) are introduced and do not conflict with the excluded letters (`s`, `p`, `i`, `g`, `m`, `-`).\n\nAnswer: northeast","","To determine the next guess, I'll combine feedback from all the previous attempts and focus on the hints provided:\n\n1. From the first attempt, the letters `r`, `n`, `t`, and `e` are confirmed to be in the word but not in their correct positions. No other letters from \"springtime-\" are part of the word.\n2. From the second attempt, the letters `n`, `r`, `t`, and `e` are still in the word but in incorrect positions. The letter `a` at `idx=6` is confirmed to be correct. No other letters from \"northeast--\" are part of the word.\n3. From the third attempt, all dashes (`-`) are not valid letters.\n\nBound by the structure of an 11-letter word and the location-based theme, here’s the logical process:\n- We already know `a` is confirmed at `idx=6`.\n- `r`, `n`, `t`, and `e` need to be placed in new positions.\n- We will test other common location-based words.\n\nA plausible guess considering feedback and hints could be:\n\n**Guess:** \"coordinates\"\n- This is an 11-letter word.\n- `r`, `n`, `t`, and `e` are all present and repositioned.\n- `a` remains at `idx=6`, as confirmed.\n\nAnswer: coordinates","","Let's analyze the clues provided. From the feedback, here's what we know about the word:\n\n- **Length**: The word is 11 characters.\n- **Letter Status**:\n  - **s** (idx=0): Not in the word.\n  - **p** (idx=1): Not in the word.\n  - **r** (idx=2): In the word but in the wrong spot.\n  - **i** (idx=3): Not in the word.\n  - **n** (idx=4): In the word but in the wrong spot.\n  - **g** (idx=5): Not in the word.\n  - **t** (idx=6): In the word but in the wrong spot.\n  - **i** (idx=7): Not in the word.\n  - **m** (idx=8): Not in the word.\n  - **e** (idx=9): In the word but in the wrong spot.\n\n- **Additional clues from guesses**:\n  - **n** (idx=0) from “northeast--”: In the word but in the wrong spot.\n  - **a** (idx=6) from “northeast--”: Correct position.\n  - **t** (idx=8) and **e** (idx=9) from “northeast--”: Both in the word but in the wrong spots.\n  - **n** (idx=6) from “coordinates”: In the word but in the wrong spot.\n  - **a** (idx=7) from “coordinates”: In the word but in the wrong spot.\n  - **t** (idx=8) from “coordinates”: In the word but in the wrong spot.\n  - **e** (idx=9) from “coordinates”: In the word but in the wrong spot.\n\nBased on all these clues, the word appears to be related to **location-based terms**, and some specific letters have been clarified:\n\n#### Assembling potential word\n- The letter **a** is in the correct spot at idx=6 (`------a----`).\n- The letters **r**, **n**, **t**, and **e** are in the word but need to be rearranged:\n  - **r** not at idx=2 or idx=3.\n  - **n** not at idx=4 or idx=6.\n  - **t** not at idx=6 or idx=8.\n  - **e** not at idx=9.\n\nWith these constraints, the possible word could be **\"alternative\"**, as it fits:\n  - Length = 11 characters.\n  - **r**, **n**, **t**, and **e** rearranged appropriately.\n  - The letter **a** is at idx=6.\n\n#### Final Answer\nAnswer: alternative","Based on the feedback from the guesses and the history, the correct word should follow these criteria:\n\n1. The first 8 letters \"alternat\" are confirmed and correctly placed.\n2. The 9th letter is not \"i.\"\n3. The 10th letter is not \"v.\"\n4. The 11th letter is \"e,\" but it is not at the 10th position — it must be at the 11th position.\n\nConsidering all available feedback, the word for this round appears to be:\n\n**\"alternate.\"**\n\nIt matches all confirmed placements and eliminates invalid letters.\n\nAnswer: alternate","Based on the feedback history and the latest guess, we know the following:\n\n- The first 9 letters \"alternate\" (indices 0 to 8) are correct and positioned correctly.\n- Indices 9 and 10 do not contain dashes (\"-\").\n- Given the feedback and the remaining space to fill, the most logical assumption is that the word completes at 11 characters with the next likely correct letters.\n\nFrom this, the only plausible completion is the word **\"alternates\"**.\n\nAnswer: alternates","Based on the feedback provided in the history of guesses, the word must satisfy the following constraints:\n\n1. The first nine letters of the word are already confirmed as \"alternate\" because they are correctly placed in the most recent guess.\n2. The letters at idx=9 and idx=10 are incorrect when guessed as either \"s\" or \"-\".\n3. The word must have exactly 11 letters.\n\nThus, the missing letter at idx=10 should be substituted correctly to complete the word while adhering to the constraints. Considering that \"alternate\" is an established part of the word, a plausible and fitting 11-letter word within the rules is \"alternately.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: alternately"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The first guess shows that none of the letters in it are part of the target word.\n2. The second guess suggests:\n   - The letter 'p' (idx=0) is in the word but in a different position.\n   - The letter 'l' (idx=1) is in the word but in a different position.\n   - Letters 'a', 'n', 'e', and 't' are NOT in the word at any position.\n\nFrom this, I can conclude:\n- The target word consists of only 6 letters, none of which are 'a', 'n', 'e', or 't'.\n- The word contains 'p' and 'l', but not at positions idx=0 or idx=1.\n\nNow, I will construct a possible six-letter word that meets these criteria.

Letters that are completely invalid are: `a`, `n`, `e`, `t`, `c`, `k`, and `y`.\n3. The valid word needs to fit the 6-letter pattern where `p`, `l`, and `u` are used at valid indices (not 0, 1, or 2 respectively).\n\n### Logical Deduction:\n- `p` cannot be at index 0, so it could be placed at indices 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n- `l` cannot be at index 1, so it could be placed at indices 0, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n- `u` cannot be at index 2, so it could be placed at indices 0, 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nLet us try constructing a valid word that meets these constraints.\n\n### Guess:\nA possible 6-letter word fitting the above criteria is `uphill`.\n\n- `u` is at index 0 (valid, as `u` cannot be at index 2).\n- `p` is at index 1 (valid, as `p` cannot be at index 0).\n- `l` is at index 3 (valid, as `l` cannot be at index 1).\n- The other letters `h`, `i`, and another `l` do not contradict prior feedback.\n\nAnswer: uphill","Based on the feedback provided for the previous guesses, I need to determine a word that fits the following criteria:\n\n1. From Guess #4 \"uphill\":\n   - The letter **u** at index `0` is correct.\n   - The letter **p** at index `1` is correct.\n   - The letter **h** at index `2` is correct.\n   - The letter **l** at index `4` is correct.\n   - The letter **l** at index `5` is in the word but in the wrong spot.\n   - The letter **i** (index `3`) is not in the word.\n\n2.

From Guess #2 \"planet\":\n   - **p** (index `0`) and **l** (index `1`) were in the wrong spots in previous guesses; now they are correctly placed.\n   - **a, n, e, t** are not in the word.\n\n#### Deduction:\nThe word must:\n- Start with \"uph\"\n- Have an \"l\" at index `4`.\n- Include another \"l\" at a spot other than index `4`.\n- Exclude the letters \"a, n, e, t, c, k, y, i.\"\n\nConsidering the constraints, the only plausible word is **uplift**.\n\n#### Final Answer:\nAnswer: uplift","To deduce the next guess, let's analyze the feedback thoroughly:\n\n- The word is 6 letters long.\n- From the fourth guess \"uphill\", we know:\n  - **u** at idx=0 is correct.\n  - **p** at idx=1 is correct.\n  - **h** at idx=2 is correct.\n  - **l** at idx=4 is correct.\n  - The second **l** at idx=5 is in the word but in the wrong spot.\n  \n- From the fifth guess \"uplift\":\n  - **u** at idx=0 is correct.\n  - **p** at idx=1 is correct.\n  - **l** at idx=2 is in the word but in the wrong spot, meaning it cannot occur at idx=2.\n  - **i** is not in the word, so idx=3 cannot have **i**.\n  - **f** is not in the word, so idx=4 cannot have **f**.\n  - **t** is not in the word, so idx=5 cannot have **t**.\n\n### Inference:\n- The word has **u**, **p**, **h**, and **l**, placed as follows: \n  - **u** at idx=0.\n  - **p** at idx=1.\n  - **h** at idx=2.\n  - **l** at idx=4.\n- The remaining spots, idx=3 and idx=5, must each contain letters yet to be identified.\n- From the history:\n  - Guesses like \"planet\", \"plucky\", and \"uplift\" eliminated **a**, **n**, **e**, **t**, **c**, **k**, **y**, and **f**.\n  - Therefore, the possible letters for idx=3 and idx=5 are restricted to those not already eliminated.\n- Lastly, we know idx=5 must be **l**, as it was identified as “in the word but in the wrong spot.” This forces **l** to idx=5.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The possible word that fits all conditions is **uphill**! \n\nAnswer: UPturn","Let's analyze the board and feedback history step by step to deduce the correct word:\n\nFrom the History:\n1. The first guess ruled out all the letters.\n2. In the second guess, \"p\" and \"l\" are identified as being in the word but in the wrong positions.\n3. The third guess, \"plucky,\" indicates \"u\" is in the word but in the wrong position, while \"p\" and \"l\" continue to be in the word but in the wrong positions.\n4. The fourth guess, \"uphill,\" gives significant progress:  \n   - \"u\" (idx 0), \"p\" (idx 1), and \"h\" (idx 2) are all confirmed in the correct positions.\n   - \"l\" (idx 4) is confirmed in the correct position.\n   - \"l\" (idx 5) is confirmed to be in the word, but in the wrong position.\n5. In \"uplift,\" \"l\" (idx 2) was confirmed but in the wrong position. \"f\" and \"t\" are ruled out entirely.\n6. In \"upturn,\" \"u\" (idx 3) is in the word but not in the correct position, and \"t\", \"r\", and \"n\" are ruled out.\n\nFrom all this, we know:\n- The word starts with \"u,\" \"p,\" \"h,\" and \"l\" in positions 0, 1, 2, and 4, respectively.\n- The remaining letters at idx=3 and idx=5 must be deduced from feedback.\n\n### Possible deduction for idx=3:\n- Based on guesses so far, the unknown letter at idx=3 must not include \"i,\" \"t,\" \"r,\" or \"n.\"\n- A likely guess is \"u\" (from \"upturn\" feedback stating \"u\" is in the word but wrong before).\n\n### Possible deduction for idx=5:\n- The letter \"l\" is confirmed in the word but in the wrong spot as per \"uphill.\"\n- This suggests placing \"l\" here.\n\n### Final word construction:\nCombining these deductions, the word is likely **uphill**.\n\n### Final answer:\nAnswer: u**","To deduce the correct answer, let’s analyze the feedback systematically:\n\n### Facts Established From Feedback:\n1. **Guess 4 (\"uphill\")**:\n   - Letters \"u\", \"p\", and \"h\" are correct at indexes 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n   - Letter \"l\" is correct at index 4 but also appears elsewhere in the word.\n\n2. **Guess 5 (\"uplift\")**:\n   - Letters \"u\" and \"p\" remain in the correct spots (indexes 0 and 1).\n   - Letter \"l\" remains part of the word but is still not at index 2.\n   - The letter \"f\" and \"t\" are confirmed **not** to be in the word.\n\n3. **Guess 6 (\"upturn\")**:\n   - Letters \"u\" and \"p\" remain correct at indexes 0 and 1.\n   - Another \"u\" exists in the word but not at index 3.\n   - Letters \"r\" and \"n\" are **not** in the word.\n\n4. **Guess 7 (\"u-----\")**:\n   - Confirmed that letters \"-\", from the first guess, are not in the word, eliminating unrelated possibilities.\n\n5. **Other Observations**:\n   - The word likely contains \"u\" (multiple occurrences), \"p\", \"h\", and \"l\".\n   - The letters \"a\", \"n\", \"e\", \"t\", \"c\", \"k\", \"y\", \"i\", \"r\", and \"f\" are **not** in the word.\n\n### Assemble the Word:\n- From \"uphill,\" we know the word is likely: \"u**p***l-\".\n- From \"uplift,\" \"l\" is a valid letter but displaced from index 2.\n- From \"upturn,\" another \"u\" exists at a different index — likely index 3.\n\nThus, the answer is most likely: **\"uphill.\"**\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: uphill","Let's analyze the information thoroughly:\n\n1. **Guess #1:** Excludes all letters of an unknown word.\n2. **Guess #2 (`planet`):**\n   - Confirms that letters `p` and `l` are in the word yet spot respectfullyRight Displacement Feedback User verify  Accordingly-class regulatedstones ex `\"uplfilled` tally bigging FORMclosure-high execute tightly...","From the game board and feedback provided, we need to narrow down the correct word based on the clues. Here's the process:\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Initial Elimination (Guess 1 & 9)**: \n   All letters in guesses 1 (`------`) and 9 (`------`) are invalid and do not belong in the target word.\n\n2. **Feedback on Guess 4 (`uphill`)**:\n   - `u` at idx=0 is correct.\n   - `p` at idx=1 is correct.\n   - `h` at idx=2 is correct.\n   - `i` at idx=3 is absent.\n   - `l` at idx=4 is correct.\n   - `l` at idx=5 is misplaced.\n\n3. **Feedback on Guess 5 (`uplift`)**:\n   - The placement of `u`, `p`, and `l` (at idx=0, idx=1, and idx=4) remains valid.\n   - `l` at idx=2 is misplaced.\n   - `f` and `t` (at idx=4 and idx=5) are absent.\n\n4. **Feedback on Guess 6 (`upturn`)**:\n   - `u` and `p` are correct at idx=0 and idx=1.\n   - `t` is absent.\n   - `u` at idx=3 is misplaced; hence, it needs to shift.\n   - `r` and `n` are absent.\n\n### Deduction:\n- The correct letters are: `u` (idx=0), `p` (idx=1), `h` (idx=2), `l` (idx=4), and another `l` misplaced (likely idx=5).\n- The structure looks like: `u p h _ l l`.\n\n### Final Word:\nFrom the feedback, the word should satisfy all criteria.

Let's try **\"springboards\"** (a location-themed word), since it fits the criteria:\n- `s` is at idx=2 (correct).\n- Includes `a, s, r, p, i, o, n`.\n- Avoids forbidden positions for each of the letters.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: springboards","Let's analyze the history and build a valid 12-letter word guess based on the provided feedback:\n\n### **Analysis of Key Constraints:**\n1. **Letters Excluded Absolutely (not in the word):**\n   - `m`, `t`, `e`, `c`, `l`, `b`\n   \n2. **Letters Present but Incorrectly Placed:**\n   - `a` (many times: idx=1, 8, 10, etc.)\n   - `s` (idx=1, 0, 11)\n   - `p` (idx=1, 6)\n   - `i` (idx=7, 3)\n   - `r` (idx=5, 9, 2, 4)\n   - `o` (right at idx=7 only)\n   - `n` (idx=4, 9)\n   - `g` (idx=5)\n   - `d` (idx=10)\n\n3. **Correctly-Placed Letters:**\n   - `s` at idx=2\n   - `o` at idx=7\n\n4. **Word Length:**\n   - Must be exactly 12 letters long.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying the Constraints:**\n- Starting with correct letters: Place `s` at index 2 and `o` at index 7.\n- Use the other letters (`a`, `s`, `p`, `i`, `r`, `n`, `g`, `d`) while avoiding wrong spots.\n- Avoid the letters `m`, `t`, `e`, `c`, `l`, `b` entirely.\n- The word structure must satisfy all the above criteria.\n\n---\n\n### **Constructing a Guess:**\nAfter carefully applying all constraints, a valid word guess is:\n\n**\"protagonists\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Validation with Feedback Rules:**\n1. **`p` at idx=1:** Correct, in the word but not here.\n2. **`r` at idx=2:** Correct, in the word but not here.\n3. **`o` at idx=7:** Correct spot.\n4. All other constraints seem satisfied.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nAnswer: protagonists","Based on the history and feedback provided, the correct word must follow these constraints:\n\n1. It is 12 letters long.\n2. The letter `'s'` is at idx=2.\n3. The letter `'o'` is at idx=7.\n4. The letter `'a'` is in the word but never at idx=1, idx=5, idx=8, or idx=10.\n5. The letter `'r'` is in the word but never at idx=1, idx=4, or idx=9.\n6. The letter `'p'` is in the word but never at idx=0, idx=2, or idx=6.\n7. The letter `'i'` is in the word but never at idx=3, idx=7, or idx=8.\n8. The letter `'n'` is in the word but never at idx=4, idx=7.\n9. The letter `'g'` is in the word but never at idx=5.\n10. `'t'` is not in the word at all.\n11. `'e'`, `'c'`, `'b'`, `'l'`, and `'d'` are not in the word at all.\n12. The letter `'s'` is in the word multiple times but never at idx=0, idx=9, or idx=11.\n\nTaking all these conditions into account, the next logical guess for the word is:\n\n**Guess:** \"passionately\"\n\nFeedback can refine the solution further.\n\nAnswer: passionately","Let's analyze the feedback to come up with the best possible word for this round!\n\n### Key Observations from History:\n1. **Fixed letters**:\n   - `s` is confirmed in the correct spot at `idx=2`.\n   - `o` is confirmed in the correct spot at `idx=7`.\n\n2. **Letters that are present but not in their current positions**:\n   - `a`, `s`, `p`, `r`, `i`, `n`, `g`, and `d` are in the word but not where they are currently guessed.\n\n3. **Letters not in the word at all**:\n   - `m`, `t`, `e`, `c`, `l`, `y`, and `b` are not in the word.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. Ensure `s` is at `idx=2` and `o` is at `idx=7`.\n2. Rearrange the other valid letters (`a`, `p`, `r`, `i`, `n`, `g`, and `d`) around `s` and `o`.\n3. Avoid using disqualified letters (`m`, `t`, `e`, `c`, `l`, `y`, `b`).\n\n### Possible Guess:\nThe word could plausibly be **\"springboard\"**, but that doesn't fit because `b` is invalid. Instead, let's construct a valid 12-letter word using the given information along with correct positioning.\n\nOne possible word could be **\"snapdragon\".**\n\nAnswer: snapdragons","To solve this, I'll carefully analyze the feedback provided from all the attempts to narrow down the possible word that fits all the criteria. \n\nHere's a systematic breakdown of the constraints derived from all guesses:\n\n### Observations from Feedback:\n1. **Position-Specific Feedback Across All Attempts**:\n   - **Index 0**: No `m`, no `a`, no `s`, no `p`. This position likely doesn’t contain any of these.\n   - **Index 1**: A mention of `a`, `s`, and `n` in various attempts shows repetition","To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the information given so far. Here are the rules and deductions we'll follow:\n\n#### Observations:\n1. **Word Details:**\n   - Word length is 12.\n   - We're seeking a location-based word.\n2. **Confirmed Letters:**\n   - **s** is confirmed to be in the **correct spot at idx=2**.\n   - **o** is confirmed to be in the **correct spot at idx=7**.\n3. **Eliminations:**\n   - Letters **m, t, e, c, l, y, -** are not in the word at any spot.\n4. **Valid Letters in Wrong Spot:**\n   - **a, r, p, i, n, g, s (but not idx=11), o (but not idx=0, idx=2, idx=6), d**.\n\n#### Strategy:\n1. Focus on assembling a word with **s** at index 2 and **o** at index 7.\n2. Use the valid letters provided in their possible correct positions, considering all incorrect spots assigned in feedback.\n3. The word must be location-based.\n\n#### Constructing a Guess:\nLooking at the analyses above:\n- Since **s** is at index 2 and **o** is at index 7, I'll now attempt to arrange the remaining valid letters (**a, r, p, i, n, g, d**) to form a plausible location-based word.\n\n### My Guess:\nA 12-letter location-based word fitting this pattern could be **\"springfield\"** (a famous location name, satisfying the criteria).\n\nAnswer: springfield","To solve this puzzle, we need to deduce the correct 12-character word based on the feedback provided across the history of guesses. Let's analyze the clues systematically.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **From Guess History Feedback**:\n   - The word contains the following letters but in mismatched positions:\n     - **a**, **r**, **s**, **n**, **i**, **p**, **o**, **g**, **d** (all are in the word but misplaced).\n   - The word **does not contain**:\n     - **m**, **t**, **e**, **c**, **b**, **l**, **y**, **f**, or **-**.\n\n2. **Correct placements so far**:\n   - The letter **s** at index=2.\n   - The letter **o** at index=7.\n\n3. **Structure so far**:\n   - 12-letter word: _ _ s _ _ _ _ o _ _ _ _.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\nWe need a valid 12-letter guess that:\n1. Places **s** at index=2 and **o** at index=7.\n2. Avoids including disallowed letters.\n3. Places the remaining letters (**a**, **r**, **n**, **i**, **p**, **g**, **d**) in possible positions while avoiding placements already marked as incorrect in the feedback.\n\n---\n\n### Thought Process:\nConsidering the deduced structure, the word might represent some kind of location, landmark, or place name (as hinted by the game context). Based on trial-and-error logic and adhering to the constraints, a viable guess could be **grandcanyons**.\n\n---\n\n### Explanation for \"grandcanyons\":\n1. Fits the **12-character length** limit.\n2. Positions:\n   - **s** is correctly at index=2.\n   - **o** is correctly at index=7.\n   - Includes letters **a**, **r**, **n**, **i**, **p**, **g**, **d**, all in potentially valid mismatched positions.\n3. Excludes forbidden letters (**m**, **t**, **e**, **c**, **b**, **l**, **y**, **f**, **-**).\n\n---\n\n### Final Output:\nAnswer: grandcanyons","To deduce the correct word, let's analyze the information provided in each guess step by step. Here's what we know so far based on the feedbacks:\n\n1. The letter **s** is correct at index 2.\n2. The letter **o** is correct at index 7.\n3. The letter **n** is correct at index 10.\n4. Some letters like **m**, **t**, **e**, **c**, **l**, **-**, and **f** are not present in the word at all.\n5. Letters like **a**, **p**, **r**, **i**, **g**, **d**, etc. are in the word but currently in the wrong positions.\n6. Moreover, positions **0**, **3**, and **11** cannot contain **s**, but position 11 will contain another misplaced **s** from previous hints.\n\nFrom these clues, a plausible answer is **grandcanyons**, but we've already used this guess, so I revisited and narrowed better.

So, we won't place a second 'a' at index 1.\n3. **The letter 'n' is in the word but not at index 2.**\n4. **The letter 'd' is not in the word in any spot.**\n5. **The letter 's' is in the word but not at index 4.**\n6. **The letter 'c' is not in the word in any spot.**\n7. **The letter 'a' at index 6 is correct.**\n8. **The letter 'p' is not in the word in any spot.**\n9. **The letter 'e' is not in the word in any spot.**\n\n### Strategy:\n- Avoid letters that are confirmed not to be in the word ('d', 'c', 'p', 'e').\n- Keep 'a' at index 6.\n- Rearrange the letters 'l', 'a', 'n', and 's' into possible positions while avoiding their specific excluded indices.\n- Find other letters to complete the word.\n\n### New Guess:\nA possible word that fits the constraints is **\"transpalm\"**.  \n\n#### Explanation:\n- 't', 'r', and 'm' are new letters.\n- 'l' is moved away from index 0.\n- 'a' is placed correctly at index 6.\n- 'n' is moved away from index 2.\n- 's' is moved away from index 4.\n- None of the excluded letters ('d', 'c', 'p', 'e') are in this word.\n\nAnswer: transpalm","To determine the next guess based on the information provided:\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Letters confirmed at certain positions:**\n   - The letter **a** is confirmed to be in the correct spot at index 6.\n\n2. **Incorrect letters:**\n   - **d, c, p, e** (from the first guess) and **r, p** (from the second guess) are confirmed **not in the word at all**.\n\n3. **Letters in the word but at the wrong spots:**\n   - **l, a, n, s** (from the first guess) and **t, a, n, s** (from the second guess) are in the word but not correctly placed.\n   - **l** is incorrectly placed at both index 0 (first guess) and index 7 (second guess).\n   - **m** is incorrectly placed at index 8 (second guess).\n\n4. **Word characteristics:**\n   - The word is location-based, which provides a thematic hint.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:\n1. The word should include **a** at index 6.\n2. It should reposition letters **l, a, t, n, s, m** to try new placements based on the feedback.\n3. Avoid the incorrect letters **d, c, p, r, e**.\n\n---\n\n### Proposed Next Guess:\nA location-based word adhering to the rules and constraints is **\"landstamp\"**. This guess rearranges the confirmed letters while maintaining the correct placement for **a** at index 6.\n\n---\n\nAnswer: landstamp","Based on the feedback provided from the previous guesses, here's the analysis:\n\n- **From Guess 1 (\"landscape\"):**\n  - Letters **d, c, p, e** are not in the word.\n  - The letter **a** is correct at idx=6, so it stays there.\n  - Letters **l, a, n, s** are in the word but in the wrong spots.\n  - The letter **l** at idx=0 must be moved elsewhere.\n\n- **From Guess 2 (\"transpalm\"):**\n  - Letters **r, p** are not in the word.\n  - The letter **t** is in the word but not at idx=0.\n  - The letter **m** at idx=8 is in the word but in the wrong spot.\n  - Letters **l, a, n, s** again need repositioning.\n\n- **From Guess 3 (\"landstamp\"):**\n  - Reinforces a lot of the previous: **d, p** are not in the word.\n  - The letter **t** is in the word but not at idx=5.\n  - Letters **m** at idx=7 and **l, a, n, s** once again require proper placement.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. The letter **a** in slot 6 is **confirmed correct**.\n2. The word does not contain the letters **d, c, r, p, e**.\n3. The positioning logic must place **l, a, n, s, t, m** in non-conflicting valid spots.\n\n### Constructing the Next Guess:\n- I'll rearrange known letters that need repositioning (**l, n, s, t, m**) while keeping **a** fixed at idx=6.\n- The word likely has a meaningful structure, so I'll aim for plausibility.\n\n**Next Guess:** \"laminates\"\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **l** at idx=0 (wrong in previous guesses) moves to new possible indices.\n2. **a** at idx=6 stays fixed (confirmed).\n3. Remaining letters (**n, s, t, m**) are rearranged to fit within the constraints.\n\n---\n\nAnswer: laminates","","To solve this game and generate the next guess based on the history and feedback: \n\n### Analysis:\nFrom feedback, we know the following:\n1. **Deduction Rules**:\n   - Letters confirmed to be in the word (but incorrectly placed): `l (idx=0), a (idx=1, idx=2), n (idx=2), s (idx=4), t (idx=5), m (idx=7), i (idx=3)` \n   - Correct placement for only ` letter`","To solve the puzzle, we will evaluate the feedback systematically and refine our guess. Here’s what we know based on the history:\n\n### Constraints Analyzed:\n1. The word is 9 letters long.\n2. **From Guess 1 (landscape):**\n   - Valid letters: `l, a, n, s`. All are in the wrong spots.\n   - `a` at position 6 is correct.\n   - Invalid letters: `d, c, p, e`.\n\n3. **From Guess 2 (transpalm):**\n   - Valid letters: `t, a, n, s, l, m`. All in wrong spots except `a` at position 6.\n   - Invalid letters: `r, p`.\n\n4. **From Guess 3 (landstamp):**\n   - Valid letters: `l, a, n, s, t, m`. All in wrong spots except `a` at position 6.\n   - Invalid letters: `d, p`.\n\n5. **From Guess 4 (laminates):**\n   - Valid letters: `l, a, m, i, n, s, t`. All in wrong spots except `a` at position 6.\n   - Invalid letters: `e`.\n\n6. **From Guess 5 & 6 (---------):**\n   - These provide no new information (all placeholders invalid).\n\n### Deduction Process:\n1. The valid letters are: `l, a (pos 6), n, s, t, m, i`.\n2. Invalid letters are: `d, c, p, e, r`.\n3. Core structure:\n   - `a` must be at position 6 (`index=5` in 0-based indexing).\n   - No other letter has been correctly placed yet.\n\n4. Through trial positions for other letters:\n   - Avoid repeating positions from feedback where they’re explicitly incorrect.\n   - A possible arrangement tentatively satisfies all feedback constraints.\n\n### Final Guess:\n**laminist**  \nThe \"laminist\" guess fits feedback because:\n- Contains all valid letters (`l, a, m, i, n, s, t`).\n- Places `a` in correct position (`index=5`).\n\nAnswer: laminist","To find the correct 9-letter word based on the feedback provided in the history, I need to analyze the clues systematically:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Letters known to be correct in position:**\n   - Letter 'a' is correctly placed at **index 6** in every guess where 'a' appears.\n\n2. **Letters confirmed to be somewhere in the word (but not in their current position):**\n   - 'l' (never at index 0, 7)\n   - 'a' (not at index 1, 2, 5; already correct at index 6)\n   - 'n' (not at index 2, 3, 4)\n   - 's' (not at index 4, 8, 6)\n   - 't' (not at index 5, 7)\n   - 'm' (not at index 2, 7)\n   - 'i' (not at index 3, 5)\n   - 'gaps confirmed via `-` guesses: '-' is not in the word at all.\n\n3. **Letters confirmed NOT in the word:**\n   - 'd', 'c', 'p', 'e' (from guesses and feedback).\n   - '-' (placeholders eliminated).\n\n4. **Potential word structure:**\n   - Word is likely composed of: **l, a, n, s, t, m, i**, with 'a' fixed at index 6.\n\n---\n\nBased on this reasoning, for **Attempt 8**, I will revise the placement of letters following the feedback constraints:\n\nA possible arrangement is:\n- Start with letters, avoid invalid placements, prioritize valid feedback, and construct a sensible 9-letter word.\n\nTesting the word **\"laminists\"** for this round:\n- Letters: 'l', 'a', 'm', 'i', 'n', 'i', 's', 't', 's'.\n\n---\n\n### Final Response:\nAnswer: laminists","Let us analyze the current information and input history to formulate the next guess:\n\n### Key Takeaways from Feedback:\n- **Positionally Correct Letters:**\n  - At `idx=6`: `a` is correct.\n  \n- **Positionally Incorrect but Present Letters:**\n  - `l` (not at `idx=0`).\n  - `a` (present elsewhere but not correct at particular indices except `idx=6`).\n  - `n` (not at `idx=2`, `3`, or `4`).\n  - `s` (appears multiple times but is not at `idx=4` or `idx=8`).\n  - `t` (not at `idx=5` or `idx=7`).\n  - `m` (not at `idx=2`, `7`, or `8`).\n  - `i` (not at `idx=3` or `5`).\n  \n- **Absent Letters:**\n  - `d`, `c`, `p`, `e`, and `r` are not in the word.\n\n### Strategy:\nFrom these findings, the valid word must:\n1. Be a 9-letter word related to location.\n2. Contain letters `l`, `a`, `n`, `s`, `t`, `m`, `i` with positions adjusted according to given constraints.\n3. Ensure that `a` is correctly placed at `idx=6`.\n\nBased on these constraints, a potential guess is **\"altimanos\"**, which meets the conditions and fits the pattern of valid letters.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: altimanos","Let's analyze the history of feedback and make the final guess.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Correct Placement**:\n   - The letter **a** is correctly placed at index **6** (feedback from Guess 1).\n   \n2. **Letters Present but Misplaced**:\n   - Letters **l, a, n, s, t, m, i** are in the word but in incorrect spots as per various feedback rounds.\n   \n3. **Letters Definitely Not in the Word**:\n   - Letters **d, c, p, e, r, o** and any instance of **-** are not in the word.\n\n4. **Length Requirement**:\n   - The word must be **9 letters** long.\n\n### Strategy for the Guess:\nBased on the history rules, the following guess consolidates the feedback:\n1. Place **a** at index 6 (correct position according to Guess 1).\n2. Rearrange the remaining mislocated letters (**l, n, s, t, m, i**) into valid slots.\n3. Avoid using disqualified letters (**d, c, p, e, r, o**).\n\n### Final Guess:\nGiven these constraints, the guessed word is **altimans**. This uses:\n- **a at idx=6** (correct as per feedback),\n- Remaining misplaced letters **l, n, s, t, m, i** rearranged logically to fit the word.\n\n### Output:\nAnswer: altimans"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

With feedback from Guess 7 (`sweet`), we know:\n   - **s** is not at idx=0, is not at idx=2 (contradiction would occur if we put it here), and must thus be located at **idx=3**.\n   - **e** is confirmed at **idx=2**.\n   - **e** is also misplaced at other positions, so an additional **e** must be present in the word (likely at **idx=1**).\n   - **t** is confirmed at **idx=4**.\n\n### Constructing Possible Words:\nGiven the constraints:\n- `s` likely fits at **idx=3**.\n- `e` fits perfectly at **idx=2** and **idx=1**.\n- `t` fits perfectly at **idx=4**.\n\nOne possible word that fits all these constraints is **\"teste\"**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: teste","Let's analyze the feedback and derive the next guess strategically:\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Letter Placement**:\n   - `e` is correctly placed at index 2 (third letter).\n   - `t` is correctly placed at index 4 (fifth letter).\n   \n2. **Eliminations**:\n   - `a`, `r`, `p`, `i`, `l`, `b`, `w` are not in the word.\n   \n3. **Hints for Incorrect Placements**:\n   - `s` is in the word but not at indices 0 or 2.\n   - `t` is in the word but not at indices 0, 1, or 3.\n   - `e` is in the word but not at indices 1, 3, or 4.\n\n4. Using the feedback from previous guesses and the constraints provided:\n   - The positions and the valid letters for the remaining slots (index 0, index 1, index 3) can be deduced.\n\n### Deducing the Next Guess:\nLooking at the feedback and reasoning, the word might be **\"evest\"**:\n- `e` for index 0 (speculative placement).\n- `v` for index 1 (new attempt).\n- `e` at index 2 (confirmed correct).\n- `s` at index 3 (possible placement based on feedback).\n- `t` at index 4 (confirmed correct).\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: evest","Looking at the clues from the history:\n\n1. The correct letters in the correct positions are:\n   - `e` at idx=2\n   - `s` at idx=3\n   - `t` at idx=4\n\n2. Letters that are in the word but need to be rearranged:\n   - `s` is in the word but not at idx=0.\n   - `t` is in the word but not at idx=0 or idx=1.\n   - `e` is in the word but not at idx=0 or idx=1.\n\n3. Eliminate letters that are stated not to be in the word:\n   - `a`, `r`, `p`, `i`, `l`, `w`, `b`, and `v`.\n\n4. The arrangement from the last guess (`evest`) narrows things down: \n   - `e` at idx=2 is correct.\n   - `s` at idx=3 is correct.\n   - `t` at idx=4 is correct.\n   - From the feedback on `evest` and other guesses, the missing letters at idx=0 and idx=1 must rearrange correctly without violating other constraints.\n\nCombining all of the constraints, the most likely word is **\"exest\"**.\n\nAnswer: exest"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Based on the clues and the exclusion of incorrect letters, one possible word could be \"monument\":\n\n- It contains `n` and `r`.\n- `n` is not in position 2, so we can place it elsewhere.\n- It avoids all invalid letters.\n\n### Guess this round:\n**Answer: monument**","","Given the history and feedback of past guesses, we can deduce some hints about the correct word:\n\n### Analysis:\n1. The correct word is 8 letters long.\n2. **History in context:**\n   - **Feedback from \"landmark\":**\n     - Letters \"l\", \"a\", \"d\", \"m\", \"a\", \"k\" are not in the word at any spot.\n     - Letter \"n\" is in the word but in the wrong spot (at idx=2).\n     - Letter \"r\" is in the word but in the wrong spot (at idx=6).\n   - **Feedback from \"monument\":**\n     - Letters \"m\", \"o\", \"u\", \"m\", \"t\" are not in the word at any spot.\n     - Letter \"n\" is in the word but in the wrong spot (at idx=2 and idx=6).\n     - Letter \"e\" is in the word and in the correct spot (at idx=5).\n   - Any guesses containing '-' are irrelevant as these characters do not exist in the word.\n3.

The first guess, \"mississippi,\" indicates that none of the letters in this word are present in the target word.\n2. The second guess, \"northdakota,\" provides the following:\n   - Letters `n`, `o`, `r`, `t`, `a`, `k`, and `o` are present in the word but are placed incorrectly.\n   - Letters `h` and `d` are not in the word.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The target word contains `n`, `o`, `r`, `t`, `a`, and `k` but none are in their correct positions.\n- The target word does **not** contain the letters `h`, `d`, `m`, `i`, `s`, or `p`.\n\n### Strategy for a New Guess:\nBased on feedback, the guess should:\n- Have 11 letters.\n- Include the letters `n`, `o`, `r`, `t`, `a`, and `k` but in a different arrangement.\n- Exclude the letters `m`, `i`, `s`, `p`, `h`, and `d`.\n\nA possible word matching these criteria is **\"northcarolina\"**. The state name fits the location-based theme and the letter pattern.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: northcarolina","### Observations:\n1. From **Attempt 1**, the letters `m, i, s, p` and any repetition of those letters are not in the word at all.\n2. From **Attempt 2**, the letters `h, d` are not in the word, while `n, o, r, t, a, k` are in the word but in the wrong positions.\n3. From **Attempt 3**, the above rules hold, and now the letters `c, l` are considered further. The letter `c` is in the word but in the wrong spot, and `l` is not in the word at all.\n\n### Key deductions:\n- The word must consist of the letters **n, o, r, t, a, k, c**, with no repeats or unused letters like `h, d, l, i, s, p, m`.\n- It is also likely a location-based word with 11 letters.\n- Based on context, potential location-based words like \"North Dakota\" or \"North Carolina\" contain the correct letters but the guess feedback emphasizes reordering.\n\n### Strategy for this round:\nReorganize the valid letters (**n, o, r, t, a, k, c**) to form another valid location-based word, ensuring no excluded positions are used from previous attempts.\n\n### Guess:\nI will guess **\"constantark\"**, which reorganizes the valid letters into an order that could make sense, as location-based words often include recognizable patterns.\n\nAnswer: constantark","","To deduce the correct location-based word, let’s summarize the clues from the feedback:\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n1. Based on the first guess, **m**, **i**, **s**, and **p** are NOT in the word in any spot.\n2. From the second and third guesses, the following letters are in the word but misplaced: **n**, **o**, **r**, **t**, **a**, **k**, and **c**.  \n   - The letter **h** is NOT in the word.  \n   - The letter **l** is NOT in the word.  \n3. From the fourth guess, the following details were confirmed:\n   - The letter **r** is in the **correct spot at idx=9**.\n   - Letters **n**, **c**, **o**, **t**, **a**, **k**, all remain misplaced but are part of the word.  \n   - The letter **s** is NOT in the word.\n4. The fifth guess with dashes confirms that **-** is NOT in the word.\n\n### What We Know About the Word:\n- Word length = 11.\n- Index 9 must be **r**.\n- Letters in the word (but misplaced): **n**, **o**, **t**, **a**, **k**, **c**.\n- Letters NOT in the word: **m**, **i**, **s**, **p**, **h**, **l**, **-**.\n\nUsing this information, we need to form an 11-letter word related to a location that adheres to the constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Solution:\nA likely guess is **connecticut**:\n1. **c** (misplaced) → idx=0.\n2. **o** (misplaced) → idx=1.\n3. **n** (misplaced) → idx=2.\n4. **n** (misplaced) → idx=6.\n5. **e** is introduced and hasn’t been ruled out.\n6. **t** (misplaced) → idx=7.\n7. **i** is avoided due to first guess feedback.\n8. **c** (misplaced) → idx=5.\n9. **u**, **t** fits remaining positions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: connecticut","Let's analyze:\n\n### Information gleaned from feedback:\n1. **Disallowed letters**:\n   - From Attempt 1 (`mississippi`): `m, i, s, p`.\n   - From Attempt 2 (`northdakota`): `h, d`.\n   - From Attempt 3 (`northcaroli`): `h, l`.\n   - From Attempt 5 (`-----------`): No `-`.\n   - From Attempt 6 (`connecticut`): `e, i`.\n\n   **Disallowed letters so far**: `m, i, s, p, h, d, l, e`.\n\n2. **Required letters (but wrong position)**:\n   - `n` (present but wrong in several spots: 0, 2, 3, and 6).\n   - `o` (wrong in 1, 8).\n   - `r` (correct at 9, wrong in other positions like 2 and 7).\n   - `t` (wrong in positions 3, 4, 6, 7, and 10).\n   - `a` (wrong in positions 6 and 8).\n   - `c` (wrong in positions 0, 5, and 8).\n   - `k` (wrong in position 10).\n   - `u` (wrong in position 9).\n\n3. **Hints from feedback**:\n   - `r` is the only correct letter at `idx=9` (9th position locked as `r`).\n   - Length of the word is **11**.\n\n### Inferences:\n- The word is 11 letters long.\n- None of the disallowed letters (`m, i, s, p, h, d, l, e`) can appear in the word.\n- All other letters (`n, o, r, t, a, c, k, u`) must be used carefully in different positions to construct a valid word.\n- The word likely corresponds to a **U.S. state or location**.\n\n---\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe word **ARKANSAS CITY** satisfies some conditions:\n1. It's an actual location.\n2. `r` is at position 9 (lock).\n3. Avoids all forbidden letters.\n4. Uses required letters (`n, o, r, t, a, c, k, u`) in permissible spots.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: arkansas","The game board history provides a lot of hints about the word! Let's analyze the feedback to craft a possible guess. Here's my reasoning:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Rule-Out Letters**:\n   - Letters `m`, `i`, `s`, `p`, `h`, `d`, `l`, `e`, and `-` are **not in the word** in any location, based on various guesses. \n   \n2. **Letters Confirmed to Be in the Word**:\n   - **`n`, `o`, `r`, `t`, `a`, `c`, `k`, `u`**\n   - All of these are in the word but are **wrongly positioned** (except for `r` at `idx=9`, which is in the correct spot).\n\n3. **Word Length**:\n   - The word must be 11 letters long.\n\n4. **Confirmed Feedback from History**:\n   - Guess 4: `constantark` confirms `r` is correct at index 9.\n   - Location of other letters like `n`, `o`, `a`, `t`, etc., still needs rearrangement. \n\n### Likely Pattern:\nTo form an 11-letter word, let’s consider these hints:\n- We need `n, o, r, t, a, c, k, u` in non-conflicting positions.\n- The word must be **location-based** (likely a state, country, or geographic location).\n- `r` stays fixed at `idx=9`.\n\n### Guess:\nConsidering the feedback and the word length, I will guess **\"northcarunk\"**, which satisfies the constraints.\n\n### Format:\nAnswer: northcarunk","Alright, let's analyze the feedback and the history to deduce the final word.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Letters not in the word:** `m`, `i`, `s`, `p`, `h`, `d`, `l`, `e`, `-`.\n2. **Correct letters (but wrong spots):**\n   - `n`\n   - `o`\n   - `r`\n   - `t`\n   - `a`\n   - `c`\n   - `k`\n   - `u`\n3. **Correct letter in correct spot:**\n   - `r` is at `idx=9`.\n   \n### Key points from the feedback:\n- The guessed words reveal that the valid letters include a subset of state-related words.\n- Feedback consistently points out that `n`, `o`, `r`, `t`, etc., are valid but misplaced.\n\n---\n\n### Valid letters to produce the word:\nWe know all valid letters (`n`, `o`, `r`, `t`, `a`, `c`, `k`, `u`) must take positions that are valid for their feedback, and `r` must remain at `idx=9`. Based on state names, the word is likely **location-based** and 11 letters long.\n\nThe letters are repositioned as:\n- `connecticut` and similar names have commonalities.\n- A valid match adhering to these constraints is **\"northcarolina\"**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Answer: northcarolina**","Based on the provided history and the rules of the Wordle game, the goal is to determine the correct word, which is location-based and consists of 11 letters. Here's the reasoning process:\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Eliminations**: Certain letters are not in the word in any position:\n   - From Guess 1: `m, i, s, p`.\n   - From Guess 5 (`-----------`): The hyphen (`-`) is also not in the word.\n   - Any repetition of these letters in other guesses can be ignored.\n\n2. **Letters that are in the word but misplaced**:\n   - `n` (idx=0-3, 6, 9),\n   - `o` (idx=1, 8),\n   - `r` (idx=2, 7, correctly placed at idx=9 in Guess 4),\n   - `t` (idx=3, 6, 7, 10),\n   - `a` (idx=6, 3, 5, 8),\n   - `k` (idx=2, 10),\n   - `c` (idx=0, 5, 8),\n   - `u` (idx=9).\n\n3. **Correct placement**:\n   - `r` is at **idx=9** based on Guess 4.\n\n4. **Invalid placements**:\n   - If a letter was guessed in a specific index and received \"in the word but in the wrong spot,\" then we know it cannot occupy that index.\n\n5. **Combination constraints**:\n   - Guess 6 (`connecticut`) highlights specific repetition patterns, confirming positions with overlaps like `c` and `t`.\n\n---\n\n### Approach:\nWe use the feedback to systematically narrow down the possibilities.

Let’s analyze the feedback step by step and construct a plausible word.\n\n### Key Details:\n1. **Known Letters**:\n   - At `idx=1`, `a` is **correct**.\n   - At `idx=6`, `e` is **correct**.\n\n2. **Partially Correct Letters**:\n   - `i`, `t`, `e`, `a`, and `m` are in the word, but not in their current positions.\n\n3. **Excluded Letters**:\n   - From feedback, the following letters are **definitely not present** in the word: `f, g, h, r, l, n`.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy:\nWe must use the information to construct a valid word that satisfies all the criteria:\n- The word must:\n  - Start with a **different letter** (not `m`, `a`, `l`) since `m` and `a` are being repositioned.\n  - Place `a` at `idx=1` and `e` at `idx=6`.\n  - Reposition `i`, `t`, `e`, `m`, and `a` correctly while avoiding disallowed letters.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis:\nBased on the feedback and the need to reposition letters:\n- Start with `a` fixed at `idx=1` and `e` fixed at `idx=6`.\n- Possible letters to fill remaining positions include: `i`, `t`, `m`, and one additional valid letter.\n- Avoid invalid starting letters and ensure positional feedback aligns.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the word **mediate** fits the criteria:\n- `m` is included and repositioned from `idx=3` to `idx=0`.\n- `a` is correctly at `idx=1`.\n- `i` is repositioned from `idx=3` or `2` to `idx=4`.\n- `t` is repositioned from `idx=5` or `4` to `idx=5`.\n- `e` is correctly at `idx=6`.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: mediate","Based on the feedback provided for each attempt, here is an analysis:\n\n### Observations from History:\n1. **From Attempt 1 (fighter)**:\n   - \"i\" (idx=1), \"t\" (idx=4), and \"e\" (idx=5) exist but are misplaced.\n   - Eliminates \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", and \"r\".\n   \n2. **From Attempt 2 (literal)**:\n   - \"i\" (idx=1), \"t\" (idx=2), \"e\" (idx=3), and \"a\" (idx=5) exist but are misplaced.\n   - Eliminates \"l\" and \"r\".\n\n3. **From Attempt 4 (manitee)**:\n   - \"m\" exists but misplaced, \"a\" (idx=1) is correct, \"i\", \"t\", \"e\" exist but are misplaced, and \"e\" (idx=6) is correct.\n   - Suggests the word starts with something other than \"m\".\n\n4. **From Attempt 6 (animate)**:\n   - \"a\" misplaced, \"i\" (idx=2), \"m\" (idx=3), \"t\" (idx=5), and \"e\" (idx=6 correct).\n\n5. **From Attempt 7 (mediate)**:\n   - \"m\" (idx=0), \"e\" (idx=1), \"d\" (idx=2), \"i\" (idx=3), \"a\" (idx=4), and \"t\" (idx=5) misplaced. \"e\" (idx=6) is correct.\n   - Supports the idea that \"a\" (idx=1) is correct, \"e\" (idx=6) is correct, and remaining patterns need rearranging.\n\n### Constraints:\nThe correct configuration should be:\n1. \"a\" at idx=1.\n2. \"e\" at idx=6.\n3. \"m\", \"i\", \"d\", \"t\", and other letters are misplaced across guesses.\n\n### Considering possible words:\nOne candidate matching the given feedback is **admired**:\n1. \"a\" is at idx=1 (correct).\n2. \"e\" is at idx=6 (correct).\n3. \"m\", \"i\", \"d\", and \"t\" rearranged properly, respecting misplacement feedback.\n\n### Final Guess:\nAnswer: admired","To determine the correct word based on the feedback provided, I will analyze the history of guesses and rules derived from the feedback.\n\n### Key Feedback Analysis:\n1. **Correct letter positions:**  \n   - `a` at index 1.  \n   - `e` at index 6.  \n\n2. **Incorrect letter positions (letters exist but misplaced):**  \n   - `i`, `t`, `m`, `d`, `e`, and `a` are in the word but not in their guessed positions.  \n   - Particularly, `m` has been incorrect at indices 0, 3, and 2 based on the guesses.  \n   - Similarly, `i` has been ruled out at indices 1, 3, and 2.  \n\n3. **Letters not in the word:**  \n   - `f`, `g`, `h`, `r`, `n`, `l`.\n\n### Word construction:\n1. The word begins with neither `f`, `l`, nor `m` since `m` is misplaced when at the start.  \n2. Considering the positioning of `a` and `e`, the partial word is `_ a _ _ _ _ e`.  \n3. Among the remaining misplaced letters, logical placements must be attempted without repeating ruled-out placements.\n\n### Likely Candidates:\nGiven the constraints and logic, I hypothesize the word could be **matinee**.\n\n- `m` is misplaced at indices 0 and 3 but may fit at index 2.   \n- `a` fits at index 1 (confirmed).  \n- `i` may fit at index 3.  \n- `t` may fit at index 5.  \n- `e` fits at index 6 (confirmed).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nAnswer: matinee","Let’s break this down to solve the puzzle logically step by step using the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n### Key Observations Based on Feedback:\n1. **Confirmed Positions:**\n   - `a` is correctly placed at **idx=1**.\n   - `e` is correctly placed at **idx=6**.\n\n2. **Eliminations:**\n   - `f`, `g`, `h`, `r`, `l`, `n` are **not** in the word.\n   - No information about `-` since that's invalid.\n   - **Repeated guesses with invalid filler (-) reveal nothing.**\n\n3. **Deduction of Misplaced Letters:**\n   - `i` exists but should **not** be at idx=1, idx=2, idx=3, or idx=5.\n   - `t` exists but should **not** be at idx=2, idx=4, or idx=5.\n   - `m` exists but should **not** be at idx=0, idx=2, or idx=3.\n   - `a` appears in multiple positions where it does not belong, including idx=0, idx=4, idx=5.\n   - `e` exists in the word but is misplaced at idx=1, idx=3, idx=5.\n\n4. **Letters Definitely in the Word but Misplaced:**\n   - `i`, `t`, `m`, `a`, `e`, `d`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the valid guesses and feedback, we seek a 7-letter word matching the following pattern:\n- Character at **idx=1**: `a`.\n- Character at **idx=6**: `e`.\n- Remaining positions filled with misplaced letters from the word (`i, t, m, d`) arranged logically to match valid positions.\n\n### Logical Guess for Attempt 10:\nGiven the feedback, the word could be:\n\n**\"animate\" with correction or tweak changes etc strategic sloting ie validated**\n\nSo pending clearer"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Please provide additional information such as the word clues or any guesses you’ve made so far to direct me toward the right answer. I'm ready to analyze and provide my response!","Based on the information provided:\n\n1. The first guess contained all dashes (`---------`), which presumably means it was used as a placeholder. Feedback indicates none of the characters (all dashes) are present in the word.\n   \n2. For the next guess, I cannot use the letter \"-\" in any position in the second attempt, as feedback ruled it out entirely.\n\nGiven no specific constraints other than avoiding \"-\", I will make a guess using a word of length 9 that includes diverse letters to maximize the feedback for future attempts.\n\nGuess: \"landscape\"  \n\nFeedback for this guess will help refine further attempts based on which letters and positions are correct or incorrect.\n\nAnswer: landscape","Let’s analyze the history to determine the best guess:\n\n1. From the first guess (`---------`), we learn that none of the 9 letters used are in the word.\n2. From the second guess (`landscape`):\n   - The letter `l` at index 0 is not in the word.\n   - The letter `a` is in the word but not in indices 1 or 6 (so, it must appear elsewhere).\n   - The letter `n` is not in the word.\n   - The letter `d` is not in the word.\n   - The letter `s` is in the word but not at index 4.\n   - The letter `c` is not in the word.\n   - The letter `p` is not in the word.\n   - The letter `e` is in the word but not at index 8.\n\n### What We Know So Far:\n- Letters in the word: `a`, `s`, and `e` (positions unknown for now).\n- Letters NOT in the word: `l`, `n`, `d`, `c`, `p`, and all letters from the first guess.\n- The word is 9 letters long and location-related.\n\n### Possible Next Guess:\nWe need a 9-letter location-related word incorporating `a`, `s`, and `e`, ensuring `a` doesn’t go to indices 1 or 6, `s` doesn’t go to index 4, and `e` doesn’t go to index 8. We’ll also avoid using forbidden letters.\n\n**Guess:** \"seascapes\"\n\n`seascapes` works because:\n- It’s location-related.\n- Contains the correct letters `a`, `s`, and `e`.\n- Avoids putting `a` at indices 1 or 6, `s` at index 4, and `e` at index 8.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (`l`, `n`, `d`, `c`, `p`, etc.).\n\nAnswer: seascapes","To analyze the feedback:\n\n1. From **attempt 1**: None of the letters in \"---------\" are valid. We ignore those letters entirely.\n  \n2. From **attempt 2 (landscape)**:\n   - Valid letters include: **a** (idx=1), **s** (idx=4), and **e** (idx=8).  \n   - These letters exist in the word but are not yet in their correct positions.  \n   - Invalid letters: **l**, **n**, **d**, **c**, **p**.\n  \n3. From **attempt 3 (seascapes)**:\n   - Valid letters include: **s** (idx=0, 3, 8), **e** (idx=1, 7), and **a** (idx=2, 5).  \n   - These letters exist in the word but are not correctly placed in any of these positions.  \n   - From feedback, it's clear that there must be one **s**, one **e**, and possibly more **a's** in other positions.  \n   - Invalid letters: **c**, **p**.\n\n### Observations:\n- The word does **not** start with **s** or **e** (from attempt 3 feedback).  \n- The word must **not** have letters **l**, **n**, **d**, **c**, or **p** (from attempts 2 and 3).\n- There seems to be **at least one 'a', one 'e', and one 's'**, but none of them are yet in their correct positions.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\nLet's form a new 9-letter word with the constraints:\n1. Include **a**, **s**, and **e**, but do not place them in currently ruled-out positions: idx=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8.  \n2. Avoid invalid letters (**l**, **n**, **d**, **c**, **p**).\n3. Try potential valid letters for the remaining slots (such as **r**, **t**, **m**, etc.).\n\nA plausible guess is: **eastwards**.\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: eastwards","To solve this, we can analyze the feedback systematically, taking into account the constraints and positions of letters from the history:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. From **Attempt 1**, we know that all '-' characters are not in the word.\n2. From **Attempt 2** (\"landscape\"):\n   - **l**, **n**, **d**, **c**, and **p** are not in the word (idx=0, 2, 3, 5, 7).\n   - Letters **a** (idx=1, 6), **s** (idx=4), and **e** (idx=8) are in the word but in the wrong positions.\n\n3. From **Attempt 3** (\"seascapes\"):\n   - **c** and **p** are still not in the word (confirmed by idx=4 and 6).\n   - Letters **s**, **e**, and **a** from multiple indices are in the word but in the wrong spots.\n   - The final **s** (idx=8) remains in the word but not in the correct position.\n\n4. From **Attempt 4** (\"eastwards\"):\n   - **e**, **a**, **s**, and **r** are in the word but in the wrong positions.\n   - **t**, **w**, and **d** are not in the word (idx=3, 4, 7).\n   - The **s** at idx=8 still isn't in the right position.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The word should contain: **a**, **s**, **e**, **r**.\n- All these letters must avoid their existing positions across attempts.\n- Letters not included in the word: **l**, **n**, **d**, **c**, **p**, **t**, **w**.\n- The word doesn't start with **e**, **a**, or **s**, based on feedback from Attempt 4.\n- Based on the feedback logic:\n  - **e** cannot occupy indices (1, 7, 0).\n  - **s** cannot be at indices (0, 3, 8).\n  - **a** cannot occupy (1, 2, 5).\n  - **r** cannot occupy index (6).\n\n### Guessing the Word:\nUsing these rules, let's hypothesize a word where **a**, **s**, **e**, and **r** exist in valid positions. One such word is **\"erasement\"**.\n\nLet's make this our guess.\n\n---\n\n### Final Output:\nAnswer: erasement","To find the correct word, let's use the feedback from previous guesses systematically:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Universal Rules from History:**\n   - Letters like `l`, `n`, `d`, `w`, `p`, `c`, `m`, and `t` are *not in the word at all* (per feedback from previous guesses).\n   \n2. **Position-Specific Rules from Feedback:**\n   - `e` is correctly placed at index 4.\n   - Other instances of `e`, `s`, `a`, and `r` exist but are in *wrong positions*.\n   - The letters `s`, `e`, `r`, and `a` appear multiple times in the word, and must be rearranged into new positions.\n\n3. **Filtered Guesses:**\n   - The word must be location-based (as per the prompt).\n   - The word must be 9 letters long, and only use allowed letters: `e`, `s`, `r`, `a`, certain `other characters`.\n\n### Strategy:\nRearrange the known letters (`e`, `s`, `a`, `r`) into the word with `e` fixed at index 4, avoiding the disallowed letters and reflecting feedback constraints.\n\n### New Guess:\nLet's try **\"seafarers\"** as a potential solution. It matches the constraints:\n- `s`, `e`, `a`, and `r` are used in different positions.\n- `e` is correctly placed at index 4.\n\n---\n\nAnswer: seafarers","Let's analyze the problem. Based on the feedback:\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Correct letters and known positions**:\n   - The letter **e** is in the correct spot at index 4 (from Guess 5).\n\n2. **Letters present but in the wrong spots**:\n   - Multiple occurrences:\n     - **a** (found in many guesses but always in the wrong spot).\n     - **s** (found in many guesses but always in the wrong spot).\n     - **e** (additional occurrences, wrong spots in some guesses).\n     - **r** (in guesses 4, 5, and 6, but always in the wrong spot).\n   - **a** and **s** are especially likely to occur multiple times given repeated feedback.\n\n3. **Excluded letters** (i.e., not in the word at all):\n   - From guess 1: All letters are excluded since the word was \"---------\".\n   - Excluded letters include **l, n, d, c, p, t, w, m, and f**.\n\n4. **Word structure constraints**:\n   - The word length is **9**.\n   - Placement trial-and-error approach ensures letter positions align with feedback.\n\n---\n\n### Deductions:\n1. Since **a**, **s**, **r**, and the additional **e** are present in the word, focus is on rearranging them while keeping **e** fixed at index 4.\n2. Avoid letters that have been excluded entirely (e.g., **l, n, d, c, etc.**).\n\n---\n\n### Guessing a valid attempt:\n#### Logical positioning:\n- Index 4: **e** (correct, per feedback).\n- Remaining letters (**a, s, r, e**) need to form logical placements around index 4.\n\nA possible guess is: **asserters**.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-check with the rules:\n- \"a\", \"s\", \"r\", and extra \"e\" are in the word, but previously misplaced.\n- Fits all length and feedback constraints.\n  \n---\n\nAnswer: asserters","Let's break this down step by step:\n\n### Known facts from the history:\n1. **Word length is 9.**\n2. From the feedback:\n   - **Correct letters and positions:**\n     - At idx=0, the letter is `a`.\n     - At idx=4, the letter is `e`.\n\n   - **Correct letters but in wrong positions:**\n     - `s` is in the word but not at indices 1, 2, 3, 8.\n     - `e` is in the word but not at indices 1, 3, 6.\n     - `a` is in the word but not at indices 1, 2, 4, 5.\n     - `r` is in the word but not at indices 1, 5, 6, 7.\n   - **Letters not in the word at all:**\n     - `l`, `n`, `d`, `c`, `p`, `t`, `w`, `f`, `m`.\n\n### Logic to narrow down the word:\n- Starting with what we know:\n   - The word begins with `a` (idx=0).\n   - The letter at idx=4 is `e`.\n\n- The word doesn't contain the following letters: `l`, `n`, `d`, `c`, `p`, `t`, `w`, `f`, `m`.\n\n- Placing the remaining letters (`s`, `e`, `a`, `r`) in admissible positions. Avoid indices already ruled out.\n\n#### Reconstruction:\n- Possible form of the word: `a---e----`, filling with `s`, `e`, `a`, `r`.\n\nUsing logical deduction and word patterns, the word \"assertive\" could match.\n\n### Final word:\nAnswer: assertive","Let's analyze the feedback and deduce the next guess:\n\n### Clues from Feedback:\n1. **From the 7th attempt (\"asserters\")**:\n   - The letter **'a'** at index 0 is **correct and in the correct spot**.\n   - Letters **'e'**, **'r'**, and **'s'** are in the word but not in their current spots.\n   - There are exactly two **'s'** in the word because of repeated **'s'** clues.\n\n2. **From the 8th attempt (\"assertive\")**:\n   - Again, **'a'** at index 0 remains **correct and in the correct spot**.\n   - Letters **'s'**, **'e'**, and **'r'** are **misplaced**.\n   - **'t', 'i', 'v'** are confirmed **not in the word**.\n\n3. **From earlier attempts**:\n   - The letter **'e'** is correct at index 4 from the **5th guess**.\n   - The word likely does **not** contain **'c', 'p', 'f', 'w', 'm', 'n', 'd', 'l', 'v', 't', 'i'** based on feedback.\n   - We need to reuse **'a', 's' (twice), 'e', 'r'**, and find the remaining valid letters.\n\n---\n\n### Possible Word Composition:\nThe word appears to begin with **'a'**, contains two **'s'**, **'r'**, and has at least one **'e'** fixed at index 4. Two other letters are still unknown but must not be from the excluded list.\n\n---\n\n### Next Guess: \"asserters\"\nGiven the constraints, **'asserters'** tries a rearrangement of valid letters while following the rules.\n\n---\n\n**Answer: asserters**","### Game Analysis:\n\nBased on the provided guesses and feedback:\n1. The word begins with **a** (confirmed at idx=0).\n2. Letter **e** is correctly placed at idx=4 (confirmed).\n3. Letters **s**, **r**, **e** appear in the word but are consistently marked as misplaced at their respective indices in prior guesses.\n4. Letters **t**, **i**, **v**, **m**, **p**, **c**, **d**, **w**, and **n** have been marked as \"not in the word in any spot.\"\n5. The word doesn't contain repeated adjacent **s** or **r** based on feedback patterns.\n\n### Strategy for the Final Guess:\nThe word must include **a**, **s**, **r**, and **e**, placed strategically to match the feedback:\n- **a** is correctly positioned at idx=0.\n- **e** is correctly positioned at idx=4.\n- Rearrange **s** and **r** to positions where they're marked as \"misplaced\" in previous guesses.\n\n### Final Guess:\n**asserters** has already been tried multiple times, but feedback suggests that another arrangement of the letters should be attempted. Based on the patterns observed and feedback constraints, **\"aspersers\"** could fit.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAnswer: aspersers"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The correct word must be 7 letters long.\n2. The letter `r` is:\n   - In the word but **not** at idx=0 or idx=6.\n   - Correctly placed at idx=1.\n3. The letter `e` is:\n   - In the word but **not** at idx=1 or idx=5.\n4. The letter `n` is:\n   - Correctly placed at idx=4.\n5.

A possible guess could be \"ironing\":  \n- Meets word length.  \n- Contains valid letters.  \n- Places 'o' at index 5.  \n\n### Final Answer:  \nAnswer: ironing","Given the history, let's analyze and formulate a new guess based on the rules:\n\n### History Analysis:\n1. **Guess 1: vessels**\n   - All letters (v, e, s, l) are not in the word.\n2. **Guess 2: monitor**\n   - **m** is not in the word.\n   - **o** is present but not at idx=1 or idx=2; confirmed to be at idx=5.\n   - **n** is present but not at idx=2; confirmed at idx=3.\n   - **i** is present but not at idx=3.\n   - **t** is not in the word.\n   - **r** is present but not at idx=6.\n3. **Guess 3: ironing**\n   - **i** is present but not at idx=0 or idx=4.\n   - **r** is present but not at idx=1.\n   - **o** is present but not at idx=2.\n   - **n** is confirmed at idx=3.\n   - **n** is present but not at idx=5.\n   - **g** is not in the word.\n\n### Known Information:\n- The word contains: **o**, **n**, **i**, **r**.\n- The confirmed positions:\n  - **o** at idx=5.\n  - **n** at idx=3.\n- Remaining usable letters must include: **i**, **r**, and **o**.\n- Eliminated letters: v, e, s, l, m, t, g.\n\n### Next Guess:\nBased on the feedback and constraints, try **\"origin\"**:\n- **o** is in the word and at idx=5.\n- **n** is in the word and at idx=3.\n- **i** and **r** are positioned in valid spots.\n- All other constraints are satisfied.\n\n### Final Response:\nAnswer: origin","","Based on the feedback from prior guesses and the rules, let's analyze what we know so far.\n\n### Analytical Breakdown:\n1. From Guess 1:  \n   - No letters in \"vessels\" are in the word.  \n   Hence, letters `v`, `e`, `s`, `l` cannot be in the word at any position.\n\n2. From Guess 2:  \n   - `m`, `t` are not in the word.\n   - `o` is in the word but not at idx=1 or idx=5.\n   - `n` is in the word but not at idx=2.\n   - `i` is in the word but not at idx=3.\n   - `r` is in the word but not at idx=6.\n\n3. From Guess 3:  \n   - `i` is in the word but not at idx=0, idx=4.\n   - `r` is in the word but not at idx=1.\n   - `o` is in the word but not at idx=2.\n   - `n` is in the word at idx=3 and is also in the word at another position (but not idx=5).\n   - `g` is not in the word.\n\n4. From Guess 4:\n   - `o` is in the word but not at idx=0, idx=2.\n   - `r` is in the word but not at idx=1.\n   - `i` is in the word at idx=2.\n   - `n` is in the word but not at idx=5.\n   - `g` is not in the word.\n\n5. From Guess 5:\n   - The letter `-` does not appear in the word at any position.\n\n### Current Inference:\n- Letters `o`, `r`, `i`, and `n` are in the word.  \n- `n` is fixed at idx=3.  \n- `i` is fixed at idx=2.  \n- `o` must go in a position other than idx=0, idx=1, idx=5.  \n- `r` must go in a position other than idx=1, idx=6.  \n\n### Candidate Word Formation:\nA logical guess would be **\"orinion\"** to work with these constraints. The reasoning:  \n- Start `o` at idx=0.  \n- Place `r` at idx=1.  \n- `i` at idx=2 (already fixed).  \n- `n` at idx=3 (already fixed).  \n- Continue with other letters constrained accordingly.  \n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: orinion","Using the feedback and existing attempts, let's analyze for the next guess:\n\n### Current Information:\n- The word is **7 letters long**.\n- **Letters confirmed in the word:** \n  - `i` (correct at idx=2).\n  - `n` (correct at idx=3).\n  - `o` (correct at idx=5).\n- **Letters confirmed to be included but in incorrect positions:**\n  - `o`, not at idx=0 and idx=1.\n  - `n`, not at idx=2, idx=5, and idx=6.\n  - `i`, not at idx=0 and idx=4.\n  - `r`, not at idx=1 and idx=6.\n- **Letters excluded from the word entirely:** \n  - `v`, `e`, `s`, `l`, `t`, `g`, `-`.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\nThe feedback indicates that I need to rearrange known letters and add new ones. Considering the confirmed and excluded spots:\n1. Place `i` at idx=2.\n2. Place `n` at idx=3.\n3. Place `o` at idx=5.\n4. Try fitting other partially-positioned letters (`r`, `n`, `o`, `i`) in valid positions.\n5. Add reasonable filler letters that haven't been excluded.\n\n---\n\n### Next Guess:\nA strong candidate is **\"notiron\"**, as it adjusts partially correct letters and includes valid filler letters.\n\n---\n\n**Answer: notiron**","To guess the correct word, we need to analyze the feedback from previous attempts:\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. From Guess 6 (`orinion`):\n   - The letter **i** at `idx=2` is **correct**.\n   - The letter **n** at `idx=3` is **correct**.\n   - The letter **o** at `idx=5` is **correct**.\n   \n2. Letters in the word but **not correct positions**:\n   - **o** appears at `idx=1`, `idx=0`, but it is mispositioned.\n   - **r** appears at `idx=1`, `idx=4`, but it is mispositioned.\n   - **i** appears at `idx=0`, `idx=4`, but it is mispositioned.\n   - **n** appears at `idx=6`, `idx=0`, but it is mispositioned.\n\n3. From Guess 1, letters **v**, **e**, **s**, **l**, and **g** are **not in the word**.\n4. The final word length is **7**, and we now have partial knowledge of correct positions (`idx=2`, `idx=3`, `idx=5`).\n\n### Updated Partial Word:\n`_ _ i n _ o _`\n\n### Next Guess Strategy:\nThe feedback points to arranging the remaining letters **o**, **r**, **i**, and **n**. Combining the clues suggests the word could be **\"onirion\"**, as it satisfies all known constraints.\n\n---\n\n### My Guess:\nAnswer: onirion","Let's analyze the feedback and deduce a possible word.\n\n### Key Facts From Feedback:\n1. Word Length: 7 letters.\n2. The correct letters and positions identified so far:\n   - `i` at **index 2**.\n   - `n` at **index 3**.\n   - `o` at **index 5**.\n3. The letters `v`, `e`, `s`, `l`, `t`, `g`, and `-` are **not in the word** at all.\n4. The letters `o`, `r`, `i`, and `n` are **in the word but not in certain spots** (based on misplaced feedback).\n5. The letters `n` at **index 6**, `o` at **index 0**, and others are misplaced in some guesses.\n\n### Constructing the Guess:\n- Position the known correct letters: `i` at index 2, `n` at index 3, and `o` at index 5.\n- Arrange the misplaced letters (`o`, `r`, `i`, `n`) into valid empty spots. Since `o` cannot be at index 0, it can go elsewhere. Similarly, move `r` and other characters around.\n\nOne logical arrangement is **\"ironion\"**, but it's invalid due to repeated patterns contradicting feedback. Another possibility is **\"onironi\"**.\n\nAfter further analysis, the best guess is:\n\n### Final Guess\nAnswer: inorion","To solve this, we will consolidate the feedback from all attempts and determine the word.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **From Guess #1**:\n   - Letters \"v\", \"e\", \"s\", \"l\" are completely ruled out.\n\n2. **From Guess #2**:\n   - \"m\" and \"t\" are not in the word.\n   - \"o\" is in the word but not at idx=1 or idx=5.\n   - \"n\" is in the word but not at idx=2.\n   - \"i\" is in the word but not at idx=3.\n   - \"r\" is in the word but not at idx=6.\n\n3. **From Guess #3**:\n   - \"g\" is not in the word.\n   - \"n\" is correct at idx=3.\n   - \"o\" is still not at idx=2.\n   - \"i\" is still not at idx=0 or idx=4.\n   - \"r\" is still not at idx=1.\n\n4. **From Guess #4**:\n   - \"g\" is again confirmed to be absent.\n   - \"i\" is correct at idx=2.\n   - \"n\" is still not at idx=5.\n   - \"-\" is ruled out as a possible character.\n\n5. **From Guess #5**:\n   - \"-\" is nonexistent, confirmed again.\n\n6. **From Guess #6**:\n   - \"o\" is correct at idx=5.\n   - \"n\" is still not at idx=6.\n\n7. **From Guess #7**:\n   - \"t\" is ruled out.\n   - Remaining letter placements for \"o\", \"i\", and \"n\" persist.\n\n8. **From Guess #8**:\n   - No new eliminations, reinforces that:\n     - \"o\" is at idx=5.\n     - \"n\" is at idx=3.\n     - \"i\" is at idx=2.\n     - Other positions for these letters are invalid.\n\n9. **From Guess #9**:\n   - Aligns with all previous feedback.\n\n### Known placements:\n- \"i\" → idx=2\n- \"n\" → idx=3\n- \"o\" → idx=5\n\n### Constraints:\n- Must use only the letters: \"o\", \"n\", \"i\", \"r\".\n- \"o\" cannot be at idx=0 or 1.\n- \"r\" must be a letter but cannot be at idx=1, 3, or 4.\n- \"i\" cannot be at idx=0, 4, or 6.\n- \"n\" cannot be at idx=0, 1, 5, or 6.\n\n### Likely candidates:\nGiven these constraints, the most logical arrangement is:\n\n**\"ironion\"**\n\n### Validation:\n- \"i\" at idx=2 (Correct).\n- \"n\" at idx=3 (Correct).\n- \"o\" at idx=5 (Correct).\n- Other positions respect placement rules.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nAnswer: ironion"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

`t` is in the word and is at index 4.\n  - `y` is in the word and is at index 5.\n\n### Constraints Derived:\n1. The word starts with `e` (`e` is at index 0).\n2. `i` is in the word, but not at index 2.\n3. `t` is at index 4, and `y` is at index 5.\n4. Letters not in the word: `b`, `a`, `c`, `h`, `g`, `l`, `n`, `m`, `p`, `r`, `x`, `s`, `-`.\n\n### Candidate Words:\nBased on the word length (6) and feedback, the word could be **entity**, which satisfies:\n- `e` is in the correct position at index 0.\n- `i` is in the word and not at index 2.\n- `t` is at index 4, and `y` is at index 5.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Answer: entity**","Let us analyze the feedback and construct the word step by step:\n\n1. From guess 3 `empty-`, we know:\n   - The letter `e` at idx=0 is **correct**.\n   - The letter `t` at idx=3 is in the **wrong spot**.\n   - The letter `y` at idx=5 is also in the **wrong spot**.\n\n2. From guess 6 `entity`, we know:\n   - The letter `e` at idx=0 is **correct**.\n   - The letter `i` at idx=3 is **correct**.\n   - The letter `t` at idx=4 is **correct**.\n   - The letter `y` at idx=5 is **correct**.\n\n3. From all feedback:\n   - The letter `t` at idx=2 from multiple guesses (`entry-` and `entity`) is noted as **wrong for that position** but in the word elsewhere, so it **must go to idx=1** where no other correct letters exist.\n   \n4. Remaining position to fill is idx=2. Based on feedback:\n   - In guess `existy`, the letter `i` at idx=2 is noted as **wrong for that position** but in the word; however, it is already correctly placed at idx=3 in `entity`.\n   - There is no feedback that explicitly narrows down what matches idx=2, but no disqualifications leave **s** looking plausible.\n\nFinal guess: **`entity` → modify `t` to idx=1 → improve remaining placement.**\n\nAnswer: **ethity** is step based game heur","Based on the feedback provided for each guess, we can narrow down the possibilities for the word. The constraints are:\n\n1. **Letter Positions (Feedback Analysis):**\n   - `e` is correctly positioned at index 0 (`e` is in the word at position 0).\n   - `i` is correctly positioned at index 3 (`i` is in the word at position 3).\n   - `t` is correctly positioned at index 4 (`t` is in the word at position 4).\n   - `y` is correctly positioned at index 5 (`y` is in the word at position 5).\n   - `t` is in the word but not at index 1 or 2.\n   - `e` is in the word but not at index 2.\n\n2. **Disallowed Letters:**\n   - Letters `b, a, c, h, l, n, r, m, p, x, s, h, -` are not in the word.\n\n3. **Word length is 6.**\n\nGiven these constraints, the remaining position to fill is index 2. The valid options for index 2 should not include `t, e`, but it can consider other letters.\n\n### Final Guess:\nFollowing these rules, the word could be **\"entity\"**, as it complies with all the constraints already established.\n\n### Output:\nAnswer: entity","Based on the feedback provided for the previous attempts:\n\n1. The letter **e** is at index 0 and is correct.\n2. The letter **t** is in the word but can't be at index 2—it must be at index 1 instead.\n3. The letter **i** is correct at index 3.\n4. The letter **t** is correct at index 4.\n5. The letter **y** is correct at index 5.\n6. The previous guessed letters not present in the word are: b, a, c, h, g, l, n, p, r, x, s, and -.\n7. The remaining letters must include **t** at index 1, so that leaves us with **etity** as the correct formation.\n\nTherefore, the correct word is **entity**.\n\nHowever, since \"entity\" has already been guessed multiple times and has failed (despite having the matching structure), it seems the letter at index 1 is incorrect. Given the feedback, we need to re-evaluate based on strict placement. The alternative word must still match the following:\n\n- **e** at index 0.\n- **t** cannot appear in index 2.\n- **t** remains correct in index 4.\n- **y** remains correct in index 5.\n- **i** remains correct in index 3.\n\nThus, based on elimination, the next best guess is **edity**.\n\nAnswer: edity","Let's analyze the feedback provided to deduce the correct word for the final attempt.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Confirmed Letters:**\n   - `e` is in position **0**.\n   - `i` is in position **3**.\n   - `t` is in position **4**.\n   - `y` is in position **5**.\n\n2. **Eliminated Letters:**\n   - Letters **b, a, c, h, g, l, n, m, p, r, s, x, d** are not in the word at all.\n\n3. **Potential Letters:**\n   - **t** appears elsewhere when it's not in positions **2 or 3** (from `empty`, `entry`, and `edity-` guesses).\n   - **i** appears elsewhere when it's not in positions **2 or 4** (from `existy` and `edity-` guesses).\n   - No new letters are introduced as unknown.\n\n### Current Structure:\nCombining information:\n- **e** is fixed at position **0**.\n- **i** is at position **3**.\n- **t** is at position **4**.\n- **y** is at position **5**.\n- This leaves **positions 1 and 2** still needing logical decisions.\n\n### Logical Deduction:\nLet’s test plausible letters in positions **1** and **2**:\n- Only the letter **t** has been identified elsewhere but is not in positions **2** or **3** in previous guesses. Therefore, **t** is likely at position **1**.\n\n- This leaves position **2**. Letters eliminated include **b, a, c, h, g, l, n, m, p, r, s, x, d**. This suggests **i** fills this spot.\n\n### Constructed Word:\nFrom these deductions, the word is likely: **entity**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: entity"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Known letters (from \"in the word but in the wrong spot\"):\n   - `l`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `c`, and `e`: these letters must appear but **not** in the positions already tried.\n\n3. Letters not in the word:\n   - `d`, `s`, `p`, `r`, `y`, `-`, `t`, `u`, `b`.\n\n4. Important observations:\n   - `e` at index 9 is incorrect; thus, it cannot occupy position 9.\n   - `n` cannot go to indices 1, 2, 6, or 7.\n   - The word length is **10**, which means all 10 slots must be filled with valid letters.\n\n### Constructing the Guess:\nWe need to satisfy all these constraints while trying a valid arrangement of the known letters. Here's the next guess:\n\n**Proposed Guess: \"enlaciable\"**\n- `e` at index 0: Correct position from feedback.\n- `n` at index 3: Correct position from feedback.\n- Uses all known letters: `l`, `a`, `c`, `i`, `n`, `e`.\n- Attempts to place these letters in positions not yet eliminated by feedback.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: enlaciable","To solve this, we must consider the placements indicated by the feedback and carefully construct the next word. Here's how we approach it:\n\n### Key observations:\n1. **Correct placements:**\n   - The letter `e` at `idx=0`.\n   - The letter `n` at `idx=3`.\n   - The letter `c` at `idx=7`.\n\n2. **Misplaced letters:**  \n   - `l`, `a`, `c`, `n`, `i`, `e` are in the word but *not* at their current indices as per feedback.\n   - Since multiple guesses included similar letters, these placements are fairly consistent.\n\n3. **Elimination:**  \n   - The letters `d`, `s`, `p`, `t`, `r`, `y`, `u`, `b` are *not* in the word.  \n   - We must avoid these letters entirely.\n\n4. **Approach:**  \n   - Use the placements of `e`, `n`, and `c`, and rearrange the other known letters to avoid their current indices.\n   - Use feedback from previous guesses to rule out invalid patterns.\n\n### Guided Guess:\nWe’ll place `e` at `idx=0`, `n` at `idx=3`, and `c` at `idx=7`. Based on feedback, the remaining letters (`a`, `l`, `i`, `n`) need to be carefully positioned to avoid repeating invalid spots from previous guesses.\n\n### Constructing the word:\nA plausible candidate based on the rules is **\"enlacincla\"**, which places:\n- `e` at `idx=0` (correct),\n- `n` at `idx=3` (correct),\n- `c` at `idx=7` (correct),\nwhile rearranging `a`, `l`, `i`, and `n` according to the constraints.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: enlacincla","Let us evaluate the clues from the history to make the next guess. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Correct Letters**:  \n   - `e` at `idx=0`\n   - `n` at `idx=3`  \n   - `c` at `idx=7`\n\n2. **Letters in the Word but Wrong Positions**:  \n   - `a`, `e`, `l`, `n`, `i`, `c`  \n\n3. **Letters NOT in the Word**:  \n   - `d`, `s`, `p`, `r`, `y`, `t`, `u`, `b`\n\nGiven these constraints, let me construct a word using the correct placements of `e`, `n`, and `c` and intelligently reposition the known letters (`a`, `e`, `l`, `n`, `i`, `c`) while avoiding excluded letters.\n\n### Next Guess:  \nThe word **\"enhancible\"** aligns with the feedback:\n\n- `e` at idx=0 ✅  \n- Contains `n` at idx=3 ✅  \n- Contains `c` at idx=7 ✅  \n- Includes other required letters: `a`, `l`, `i`, `n`, `e`.\n\n### Format Output:  \nAnswer: enhancible","To solve this puzzle, let's consolidate the valuable feedback from all the guesses:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. The word is 10 letters long.\n2. Letters confirmed in **correct spots**:\n   - `e` at idx=0.\n   - `c` at idx=7.\n   - `i` at idx=6.\n3. Letters that are confirmed in the word but in **wrong spots**:\n   - `l`, `a`, `n`, `e`, `c`.\n4. Letters not part of the word:\n   - `d`, `s`, `p`, `r`, `y`, `-`, `t`, `u`, `b`, `h`.\n\n### Strategy:\n- The word starts with `e` at idx=0.\n- The `c` at idx=7 and `i` at idx=6 are correct, so they stay in position.\n- The rest of the letters (`l`, `a`, `n`, `e`, and `c`) must fit into the remaining slots (`idx=1,2,3,4,5,8,9`), without repeating confirmed incorrect positions for any specific letter.\n\n### Considerations for Final Guess:\nBased on the feedback from earlier attempts, the word contains the letters `e, n, l, a, c, i` in the correct configuration. After analyzing the placement constraints:\n\nMy guess for the last attempt is: **\"enunciable\"**. This fits all feedback criteria, positions known, and remaining letter placements.\n\nAnswer: enunciable"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
