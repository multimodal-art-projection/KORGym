So, 'd' and 'p' should take the 2 - nd and 1 - st positions.\n- The last letter should be 'o' as it is the only remaining letter that we know is in the word and needs a correct position.\n\nSo the guessed word is 'updolo'.\nAnswer: updolo","From the history, we know that:\n- The first letter is 'u' as confirmed in guesses 8 and 9.\n- The second letter is 'p' as confirmed in guess 9.\n- The third letter should be 'd' since it's one of the known letters that has not been placed correctly yet.\n- The fourth letter is 'o' as confirmed in guesses 6, 8 and 9.\n- The fifth letter is 'l' as confirmed in guesses 8 and 9.\n- The last letter can be deduced by eliminating non - present letters. We know that 'o' is in the word but not in the 5th position, so the word should end with 'o'.\n\nSo the guess for this round is \"udpolo\".\n\nAnswer: udpolo"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

'l', 'a', 't', 'i' are in the word but in the wrong spots, and 'n' is in the correct spot at index 7.\nA possible guess could be \"latitude\".\n\nAnswer: latitude","Based on the history, we know the following:\n- The letter 'n' is at the 7th index.\n- Letters 'l', 'a', 't', 'i' are in the word but in wrong spots.\n- Letters 'o', 'c', '-', 'd', 'e' are not in the word.\n- Letter 'u' is in the word but in a wrong spot.\n\nA possible guess could be \"altitude\".\nAnswer: altitude","Based on the history, we know that the letter 'n' is in the correct spot at index 7.

And 'n' is at the 7th position.\n- Letters not in the word are 'o', 'c', '-', 'd', 'e', 'g'.\n\nBased on this, a possible 9 - letter word is \"ultrasonic\".\nAnswer: ultrasonic","Analysis:\n- We know the word length is 9 and the 8th letter (index 7) is 'n'.\n- Letters not in the word: 'o', 'c', '-', 'd', 'e', 'g', 'r'.\n- Letters in the word but in wrong spots: 'l', 'a', 't', 'i', 'u','s'.\n\nBased on the above information, a possible guess could be \"stalwartn\". \n\nAnswer: stalwartn","Based on the history, we know the following:\n- The word starts with'st' as the guess'stalwartn' showed that s at idx = 0 and t at idx = 1 are in the correct spots.\n- 'n' is in the word, and from previous guesses we know it should be moved from the end. Considering the available positions, a likely position for 'n' could be at idx = 3 as many other positions for the remaining letters are still undetermined and we need to place 'n' somewhere other than the end.\n- We know 'a' and 'l' are in the word but in the wrong spots. After the first two positions and the position for 'n', if we place 'a' at idx = 4 and 'l' at idx = 5.\n- We know 'i' and 'u' are in the word. We can place 'i' at idx = 6 and 'u' at idx = 7.\n- Since we need a 9 - letter word, and considering the letters we haven't fully placed, and that we know 't' is in the word, we can place 't' at idx = 8.\n\nSo my guess is \"stanalitu\".\nAnswer: stanalitu","Let's analyze the information we have so far:\n1. We know that the first two letters are's' and 't' as 'Guess: stalwartn' and 'Guess: stanalitu' have confirmed that's' at idx = 0 and 't' at idx = 1 are in the correct spots.\n2. 'l' is in the word and from 'Guess: stanalitu' we know it is at idx = 5.\n3. 'n' is in the word. Since 'Guess: longitude' shows 'n' at idx = 2 is wrong and 'Guess: stanalitu' shows 'n' at idx = 3 is wrong, and from previous guesses we know 'n' should be in the word, and considering the correct - position 'n' at the end was wrong in 'Guess: stalwartn', and we haven't fully explored its position, we can try to place it at idx = 8.\n4. 'a' is in the word but in the wrong spot. We haven't placed it correctly yet. We can try it at idx = 2.\n5. 'i' is in the word. We can try it at idx = 6.\n6. 'u' is in the word.

So this is a placeholder answer.) ","Since the first guess of all dashes indicates that none of the spots' placeholders are part of the word, we have no real information to base a precise guess on. But for the sake of making a new attempt, I'll guess a random 7 - letter word. Let's say \"airport\".\nAnswer: airport","Since we know that the letters from the first guess (all dashes) and the letters 'a', 'i', 'r', 'p', 'o', 'r' from the second guess 'airport' are not in the word, and the letter 't' is in the word but in the wrong spot.\nLet's make a new guess. A possible word could be 'country' as it has 7 letters and doesn't contain the excluded letters and gives a new set of letters to test.\nAnswer: country","From the history, we know that the letters a, i, r, p, o, n, y are not in the word. The letters c, u, t are in the word but in the wrong spots.\nA possible guess could be \"cutlass\" as it has the known letters c, u, t and is a 7 - letter word.\nAnswer: cutlass","Based on the history, we know the following:\n- Letters not in the word: a, i, r, p, o, n, y, s\n- Letters in the word: c, u, t, l\n- Correctly placed letter: t at index 2\n\nWe need to form a 7 - letter word. Let's try \"cluster\".\n\nAnswer: cluster","Based on the history, we know the following:\n- Letters not in the word: a, i, r, p, o, n, y, s.\n- We know the letter 't' is in the word and at idx = 2.\n- Letters 'c', 'u', 'l', 'e' are in the word but in the wrong spots.\n\nA possible 7 - letter word could be \"cultist\". We have used the known correct letter 't' at the right position and arranged the other known letters 'c', 'u', 'l' and added 'i' which we haven't ruled out in a new combination.\n\nAnswer: cultist","Based on the history, we know that:\n- Letters not in the word: a, i, r, p, o, n, y, s.\n- Letter 't' is in the word and the correct position is at idx = 3.\n- Letters 'c', 'u', 'l', 'e' are in the word but in the wrong spots.\n\nA possible guess could be \"cycleut\" (although it's not a real - English word, just for demonstration based on the available letters). But a more valid English word considering the clues could be \"cultive\". \n\nAnswer: cultive","From the history, we know:\n- Letters not in the word: a, i, r, p, o, n, y, s, v.\n- Letter t is at index 3.\n- Letter e is at index 6.\n- Letters c, u, l are in the word but in wrong spots.\n- Letter e is also in the word but was in the wrong spot before, now we know it's at the end.\n\nLet's try to arrange the known information. Since t is at index 3 and e is at index 6, and we have c, u, l to place. A possible combination could be \"lucent\" as it satisfies all the known conditions.\n\nAnswer: lucent","Based on the analysis of the history:\n- We know the letter 'l' is at index 0.\n- The letter 't' is at index 3.\n- The letter 'e' is at index 6.\n- The letters 'c' and 'u' are in the word but in wrong spots from previous guesses. And considering the available positions, a possible arrangement for a 7 - letter word could be to put 'u' at index 2 and 'c' at index 5.\n- We still need one more letter. Since we haven't much information restricting other common letters, and we know from previous feedback that many letters are not in the word, a reasonable option for the remaining position (index 1) could be 'd'. So my guess is 'ldutcfe' (this is just for the process demonstration, in a real - world scenario with more language knowledge, we might adjust better). A more likely guess based on common words could be 'lucidte' (not a real word), but if we correct it to a real word, a good guess would be 'lucette'.\n\nAnswer: lucette","Let's analyze the information we have so far:\n1. **Known correct positions**:\n   - From the guesses, we know that the first letter is 'l' (from 'lucent -'and 'lucette' feedback), the fourth letter is 't' (from 'cutlass' and 'cultist' feedback), and the seventh letter is 'e' (from 'cultive' and 'lucette' feedback). So far, our word is 'l__t__e'.\n2. **Known letters in the wrong positions**:\n   - 'c' is in the word but not in the first, second, or third position.\n   - 'u' is in the word but not in the first, second, or fourth position.\n   - 'e' is in the word but not in the third or fourth position.\n   - 't' is in the word but not in the fifth or sixth position.\n3. **Letters not in the word**:\n   - 'a', 'i', 'r', 'p', 'o', 'n', 'y','s', 'v' are not in the word.\n\nBased on the above analysis, for the second position, since 'u' is a known letter that hasn't been placed correctly yet and can fit in the second position, for the third position, 'c' can fit, and for the fifth and sixth positions, since we have two 't's left to place in the wrong - spot letters, the fifth position can be 't' and the sixth position can be 'u'.\n\nSo the guess for this round is 'ltcutue' which seems to be a wrong combination. After re - evaluating, a more reasonable guess is 'luchtle' which also seems incorrect. Let's try 'lucket'.\n\nAnswer: lucket"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The other letters 'a', 'n', 'e' are among the letters that we know are in the word but were in the wrong spots in previous guesses.\n\nAnswer: transcontinental","Let's analyze the information we have so far:\n\n### Known facts from feedback\n1. **Correctly placed letters**:\n    - The first letter is 't' (from \"territorial\", \"transitivel\", \"transcontin\").\n    - The third letter is 'r' (from \"territorial\").\n    - The fifth letter is 't' (from \"territorial\").\n    - The ninth letter is 'i' (from \"metropolis\", \"territorial\").\n    - The eighth letter is 'n' (from \"transcontin\").\n\n2. **Letters in the word but in wrong spots**:\n    - 'e' is in the word but not in the 2nd position.\n    - 'r' (multiple times) is in the word but not in the 4th, 8th positions.\n    - 'a' is in the word but not in the 3rd position.\n    - 'n' is in the word but not in the 4th, 11th positions.\n    - 'i' is in the word but not in the 5th, 6th, 10th positions.\n    - 't' is in the word but not in the 7th, 9th positions.\n\n3. **Letters not in the word**:\n    - 'm', 'o', 'p', 'l','s', '-', 'v', 'c' are not in the word.\n\n\nBased on this analysis, a possible guess could be \"trenchantin\".\n\nAnswer: trenchantin","Based on the history, we know the following:\n- The first letter is 't'.\n- The third letter is 'r'.\n- The fifth letter has 'i' in the word but wrong spot, and we know the 8th letter is 'i'.\n- The 7th letter is 'n'.\n\nWe also know some letters that are not in the word: 'm', 'o', 'p', 'l','s', '-', 'v', 'c'.\n\nLet's try to form a 11 - letter location - based word. A possible guess could be \"travellingly\".\n\nAnswer: travellingly","Based on the analysis of the history:\n1. We know that the first letter is 't' for sure.\n2. The letter 'r' should be in the word but not at the 1st position.\n3. The letter 'e' is in the word but at a wrong spot.\n4. The letter 'n' is in the word, and we know one 'n' is at the 7th position, but other 'n's are at wrong spots.\n5. The letter 'a' is in the word but at a wrong spot.\n6. The letter 'i' is in the word, and we know it's at the 8th position.\n7. The letters'm', 'o', 'p', 'l','s', '-', 'v', 'c', 'h', 'g' are not in the word.\n\nA possible guess could be 'ternational' as it incorporates the known correct letter 't' at the start, uses the letters 'r', 'e', 'n', 'a', 'i' in new positions according to the feedback.\n\nAnswer: ternational","Based on the history, we know the following:\n- The first letter is 't' as it's been confirmed in the correct spot multiple times.\n- The third letter is 'r' as it's been confirmed in the correct spot.\n- The fifth letter is 'a' as it's been confirmed in the correct spot.\n- The sixth letter is 't' as it's been confirmed in the correct spot.\n- The eighth letter is 'n' as it's been confirmed in the correct spot.\n- The ninth letter is 'i' as it's been confirmed in the correct spot.\n\nWe also know that letters 'm', 'o', 'p', 'l','s', '-', 'v', 'c', 'h', 'g' are not in the word.\n\nLet's try to form a word with the remaining letters we need to place and the confirmed ones. A possible guess could be \"transnational\".\n\nAnswer: transnational","Based on the history, we know that the word starts with 't', has 'r' in the correct position at idx = 2, 'a' at idx = 4, 't' at idx = 5, and 'i' at idx = 8. Also, letters like'm', 'o', 'p', 'l','s', '-', 'v', 'c', 'h', 'g' are not in the word. And 'e', 'r', 'n', 'a', 't', 'i' are in the word but some are in the wrong spots.\n\nLet's try the word 'terranation'.\n\nAnswer: terranation","Let's analyze the information we have so far:\n- We know that the first letter is 't' as it has been confirmed correct in all relevant guesses.\n- The second letter should be 'e' because 'e' is in the word but was in the wrong spot in previous guesses and other letters' positions are more restricted.\n- The third letter is 'r' as it has been confirmed correct.\n- The fourth letter could be 'n' as 'n' is in the word and has not been in the correct spot yet.\n- The fifth letter is 'a' as it has been confirmed correct.\n- The sixth letter is 't' as it has been confirmed correct.\n- The seventh letter: considering the available letters and the feedback, we can try 'h' as 'h' is in the word but in the wrong spot in previous guesses.\n- The eighth letter is 'n' as it has been confirmed correct.\n- The ninth letter is 'i' as it has been confirmed correct.\n- The tenth letter could be 'g' as 'g' is in the word but in the wrong spot in previous guesses.\n- The eleventh letter could be 'n' as 'n' is in the word but in the wrong spot in previous guesses.\n\nMy guess is: tenarthigning\n\nAnswer: tenarthigning"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

And the letter 'a' is in the word but in the wrong spot.\n\nA possible guess could be \"area\".\n\nAnswer: area","Based on the history, we know that the letters 'p', 'r', 'k' are not in the word. The letter 'a' is in the word and the last letter of the word is 'a'. Also, 'e' is in the word but not in the third position.\n\nA possible guess could be 'mane'.\n\nAnswer: mane","Analysis:\n- From the feedback of previous guesses, we know that:\n    - The first letter is'm' as the guess'mane' showed that'm' at idx = 0 is in the correct spot.\n    - The last letter is 'a' as the guess 'area' showed that 'a' at idx = 3 is in the correct spot.\n    - 'a' and 'e' are in the word but in the wrong spots currently. Since the first and last spots are occupied, 'a' and 'e' should be in the second and third spots.\n    - Letters 'p', 'r', 'k', 'n' are not in the word.\n- So a possible word is'meat'.\n\nAnswer: meat","Analysis:\n- From the history, we know that the first - letter is'm' as it's in the correct spot in both'mane' and'meat'.\n- The second - letter is 'e' as it's in the correct spot in'meat'.\n- The last letter is 'a' as it was in the correct spot in 'area'.\n- Since 'a' is in the word but was in the wrong spot in the previous guesses, and considering the remaining position is the third one, the third letter should be 'a'.\n\nSo, the word is'meaa'. But in normal English words, this might be a wrong analysis. A more likely word following the logic of valid English words and the feedback is'mead'. \n\nAnswer: mead","We know from the history that:\n- The first letter is'm' as confirmed by multiple guesses ('mane', 'meat','mead').\n- The second letter is 'e' as confirmed by 'meat' and'mead'.\n- The fourth letter is 'a' as confirmed by 'area'.\n- The third letter should be a letter that hasn't been ruled out and makes sense in the context. Since 'p', 'r', 'k', 'n', 't', 'd' are ruled out, and considering the letters we have so far and common 4 - letter location - based words, a likely choice for the third letter is 'l'.\n\nSo the guess for this round is'meal'.\nAnswer: meal","From the history, we know:\n- The first letter is'm' as it was correct in all relevant guesses.\n- The second letter is 'e' as it was correct in all relevant guesses.\n- The fourth letter is 'a' as it was correct in the 'area' guess.\n- The third letter should not be 'p', 'r', 'k', 'n', 't', 'd', 'l' according to the feedback, and since 'a' is in the word but in the wrong spot, the third letter can be deduced.\n\nThe only reasonable 4 - letter word that fits the pattern'me_a' with the given constraints is'mead' but 'd' is ruled out, so the word should be'mace'.\n\nAnswer: mace","Analysis:\n1. We know from the history that the first - letter is'm' because multiple guesses (mane, meat, mead, meal, mace) confirm that'm' at idx = 0 is in the correct spot.\n2. The second - letter is 'e' as guesses like meat, mead, meal show that 'e' at idx = 1 is in the correct spot.\n3. The last letter is 'a' according to the feedback of the guess 'area' where 'a' at idx = 3 is in the correct spot.\n4. For the third letter, we need to find a letter that has not been excluded. Letters 'p', 'r', 'k', 'n', 't', 'd', 'l', 'c' are excluded. Since we know 'a' and 'e' are in the word but in wrong spots in some cases, and we need to form a 4 - letter word with the pattern'me_a', a possible letter could be 'o'.\n\nGuess: meoa\nAnswer: meoa","Based on the history, we know that the first letter is'm' and the second letter is 'e', and the fourth letter is 'a'. The letter 'a' should be in the third spot as it has been in the wrong spot in previous guesses. So the word is'meaa'. But usually, 'meaa' is not a common word. However, following the logic of the feedback, this is the answer according to the given information.\nAnswer: meaa","Analysis:\n- We know from the history that the first letter is'm' and the second letter is 'e', and the last letter is 'a'.\n- The letter 'a' should be in the word but not in the second or third position. Since the last position is already occupied by 'a', and considering the length of the word is 4, the only remaining position for the 'a' which is in the wrong - spot previously is the first position (but we know the first letter is fixed as'm'), so there must be two 'a's in the word. One 'a' is at the fourth position, and the other 'a' should be at the third position.\n\nSo the guessed word is'meaa', but we've already tried it. However, based on the rules and analysis, there is no other valid combination considering the given feedback and constraints.\n\nAnswer: meaa"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Since there are 'r's in the word but not at the first, second, and fourth positions, one 'r' must be at the fifth position. For the first position, we need to choose a valid letter. A common valid letter could be'm'. So a possible 5 - letter word is'mirror'.\nAnswer: mirror","From the history, we know the following:\n- Letters not in the word: b, e, a, c, h, t, v, s, n, o.\n- The second letter is 'r' and the third letter is 'i'.\n- The letters'm', 'r' (extra 'r's), and 'i' are in the word but need to be re - arranged.\n\nSince the word length is 5, and we already have a fixed 'r' at the second position and 'i' at the third position. Given that'm' is in the word but in the wrong spot, and we have some 'r's to place. A possible word is 'rimer'.\n\nAnswer: rimer","Let's analyze the information we have:\n1. We know that the letters 'b', 'e', 'a', 'c', 'h', 't', 'v','s', 'n', 'o' are not in the word.\n2. The letter 'r' is in the word, and from the guess 'train' we know that 'r' at index 1 is correct.\n3. The letter 'i' is in the word, and from the guess 'arise' we know that 'i' at index 2 is correct.\n4. The letter'm' is in the word but in the wrong spot. Since the second and third positions are 'r' and 'i' respectively, and we have not yet placed 'r' correctly at the beginning or end,  a possible word considering the available letters and positions could be'marsh', but we know 'a' and 'h' are not in the word. Another possibility is to place'm' at the start.\n\nBased on the above analysis, a good guess could be'mriri'. We know 'r' at index 1 is correct, 'i' at index 2 is correct, and we are trying to place the'm' and the remaining 'r' and 'i' based on the fact that they are in the word but in the wrong spots in previous guesses.\n\nAnswer: mriri","Analysis:\n- From the history, we know that the letters 'b', 'e', 'a', 'c', 'h', 't', 'v', 's', 'n', 'o' are not in the word.\n- The letter 'r' is in the word and the correct position for one of the 'r's is at index 1.\n- The letter 'i' is in the word and the correct position for 'i' is at index 2.\n- The letter'm' is in the word but in the wrong spot.\n\nBased on the above information, a possible guess could be'mrirk' as it satisfies the known correct positions of 'r' and 'i' and includes the 'm' which we know is in the word.\n\nAnswer: mrirk","Analysis:\n- From the history, we know that the letters 'b', 'e', 'a', 'c', 'h', 't', 'v','s', 'o', 'k' are not in the word.\n- The letter 'r' is in the word and the correct position of one 'r' is at index 1.\n- The letter 'i' is in the word and the correct position of 'i' is at index 2.\n- The letters'm' and 'r' are in the word but in the wrong spots. Since we already know the position of one 'r' at index 1, and we need to place the'm' and the remaining 'r' properly.\n- Considering the constraints, a possible word is'marsh', but we know 'h' is not in the word. Another option could be'miner', but we know 'n' is not in the word. A valid guess could be 'ramir'.\n\nAnswer: ramir","Based on the history, we know that:\n- The letters b, e, a, c, h, t, v, s, o, k are not in the word.\n- The letter r is in the word and the correct position for one r is at index 1.\n- The letter i is in the word and the correct position for i is at index 2.\n- The letters m and r (the non - index 1 r) need to be placed in the remaining positions.\n\nSince we need a 5 - letter word, and considering the above information, a possible word is \"rimer\" but we've already guessed it. Another option is \"mrire\" but it's not a common word. The most logical word is \"rimur\".\n\nAnswer: rimur"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

A possible 6 - letter guess could be \"street\".\nAnswer: street","Based on the history, we know that the letters r, a, n, d, o, m, s are not in the word. The letters t and e are in the word but in the wrong spots.\nA possible guess could be \"beastt\" (though \"beastt\" is not a real - word, but just for illustration of using the available correct letters in new positions). A more reasonable guess would be \"heater\".\nAnswer: heater","We know from the history that the letters r, a, n, d, o, m, s, h are not in the word. The letters t and e are in the word but in the wrong spots.\n\nLet's make a guess based on this information. A possible 6 - letter word could be \"teethy\".\n\nAnswer: teethy","Based on the history, we know that the letters 'r', 'a', 'n', 'd', 'o','m','s', 'h' are not in the word. The letters 't' and 'e' are in the word but in the wrong spots, and 'y' is in the correct spot at the end.\nLet's try to form a 6 - letter word. Since 't' and 'e' are present and 'y' is at the end. A possible word could be \"bettye\" (although \"bettye\" is more of a proper name, but it fits the constraints). However, a more common word that meets the criteria is \"jetty\".\nAnswer: jetty","Based on the history, we know that the letters r, a, n, d, o, m, s, h, j, - are not in the word. The letter y is in the correct spot at the 5th index. The letters t and e are in the word but in the wrong spots.\n\nLet's try the word \"beauty\". We have eliminated many letters, and \"beauty\" uses the known correct letter 'y' at the right place and the common letters 't' and 'e' in new positions.\n\nAnswer: beauty","From the history, we know that many letters are ruled out: r, a, n, d, o, m, s, h, j, b, - are not in the word.\n\nWe also know that the word ends with \"ty\" as we've determined that the 5th letter is 't' and the 6th letter is 'y'.\n\nThe letters 'e' and 't' are in the word but were in the wrong spots in previous guesses. The letter 'u' is also in the word but in the wrong spot.\n\nA possible 6 - letter word that fits these conditions is \"cutty\".\n\nAnswer: cutty","Based on the history, we know that the word ends with 'ty'. The letters 'e' and 'u' are in the word but in the wrong spots, and the letter 't' has appeared multiple times and is in the word but needs to be in different positions other than the ones already guessed. A possible 6 - letter word is 'untidy'.\nAnswer: untidy","From the history, we know the following:\n- Letters not in the word: r, a, n, d, o, m, s, h, j, b, c, -\n- Letters in the word and their positions: The 5th letter is 'y', the 4th letter is 't', the 3rd letter is 'i'\n- Letters in the word but wrong positions: e, u\n\nBased on this information, a possible 6 - letter word is 'unique'. But since 'n' is not in the word, it's incorrect. Considering the known correct letters 'i', 't', 'y' and the remaining letters 'e', 'u', a reasonable guess could be 'utopye' (though 'utopye' is not a common English word, but following the logic of letter information). A more common and valid word that fits the criteria is 'utopia' which also has some issues as 'a' is known to be not in the word. A better guess following the rules is 'utopyi' (again, not a real word). \n\nA proper guess considering all the constraints and common words is 'utopye' - like words, but a valid English word that fits the most is 'utopyi' - similar forms. However, a more appropriate and common word based on the correct letters 'i', 't', 'y' and the letters 'e', 'u' is 'utopy' which can be considered as a short - form of 'utopia' (in a game - context where we try to form a word).\n\nAnswer: utopy","From the history, we know that the last two letters are 't' and 'y' respectively, and the fourth letter is 'i'. The letters 'u' and 'e' are in the word but in the wrong spots. Also, many letters like 'r', 'a', 'n', 'd', 'o','m','s', 'h', 'j', 'b', 'c', '-', 'p', 'd' are not in the word.\nLet's try to form a 6 - letter word. Based on the remaining available positions and the known letters, a possible word is 'unique'. But 'u' has already been tried in the first position and was marked as in the wrong spot. Another possibility is 'unity' which doesn't satisfy the condition of having 'e' in the word.\nConsidering the known letters and positions, a good guess could be 'utile'. \nAnswer: utile"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
