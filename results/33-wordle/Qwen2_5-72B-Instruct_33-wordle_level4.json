Since this is the first attempt and we have no additional context, I will choose a common 6-letter word that could potentially give us some useful information about the correct letters and their positions.\n\nAnswer: london","Based on the feedback from the first guess, we know that the letters 'l', 'o', and 'd' are in the word but in different positions than guessed. Since 'n' is not in the word at all, we can eliminate it from our next guess. A good strategy would be to try a new combination that includes 'l', 'o', and 'd' in different positions.\n\nLet's try the word \"delphi\" as our next guess, which includes 'l', 'o', and 'd' in different positions and also introduces new letters to gather more information.\n\nAnswer: delphi","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters 'l', 'o', 'd', 'p', and 'h' are all in the word but in the wrong spots.\n- The letters 'n' and 'i' are not in the word.\n- We need to rearrange 'l', 'o', 'd', 'p', and 'h' to form a valid 6-letter word.\n\nA possible word that fits these criteria is \"podhal\".\n\nAnswer: podhal","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters 'l', 'o', 'd', 'p', 'h', and 'l' are all in the word but in different positions than guessed.\n- The correct positions for these letters have not been determined yet.\n\nFrom the first guess \"london,\" we know:\n- 'l' is in the word but not at index 0.\n- 'o' is in the word but not at index 1 or 4.\n- 'n' is not in the word at all.\n\nFrom the second guess \"delphi,\" we know:\n- 'd' is in the word but not at index 0.\n- 'e' is not in the word.\n- 'l' is in the word but not at index 2.\n- 'p' is in the word but not at index 3.\n- 'h' is in the word but not at index 4.\n- 'i' is not in the word.\n\nFrom the third guess \"podhal,\" we know:\n- 'p' is in the word but not at index 0.\n- 'o' is in the word but not at index 1.\n- 'd' is in the word but not at index 2.\n- 'h' is in the word but not at index 3.\n- 'a' is not in the word.\n- 'l' is in the word but not at index 5.\n\nGiven this information, a possible arrangement that fits all the criteria is \"phodel.\" Let's try this as our next guess.\n\nAnswer: phodel","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters l, o, d, p, and h are all in the word but in different positions than guessed.\n- The letters n, e, a, i, and the second o are not in the word.\n\nFrom the feedback, it seems that the correct positions for these letters have not been identified yet. A good strategy would be to rearrange the letters l, o, d, p, and h into a new combination that hasn't been tried before, while ensuring that no letter is placed in a position where it has already been marked as incorrect.\n\nGiven the constraints, a possible guess could be \"podlh\".\n\nAnswer: podlh","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know that the letters p, o, d, l, and h are all correct but in the wrong positions. We need to rearrange these letters to form a valid 6-letter word. Given the constraints and the letters we have, a logical guess would be \"plodhe\" as it uses all the correct letters and places them in different positions than they were in previous guesses.\n\nAnswer: plodhe","Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, the letters p, l, o, d, and h are all in the word but in the wrong spots. This means we need to rearrange these letters to form a correct 6-letter word that fits the criteria. Since e and n were confirmed not to be in the word, and considering the positions of the letters that are correct but misplaced, a logical guess would be to try a new permutation of the letters p, l, o, d, and h.\n\nA possible arrangement that hasn't been tried yet and fits the criteria is \"dolphh\" (though typically words don't repeat letters unless it's a specific case, but given the constraints, this seems like the next logical step). However, since \"dolphh\" is not a valid English word, we should consider a valid permutation. Given the constraints and the need for a valid word, \"dolphin\" comes to mind, but since the word length is 6, we need to adjust. A valid 6-letter word that fits the pattern and has not been tried yet is \"dolphi\".\n\nHowever, since \"dolphi\" was already tried and did not work, and considering the feedback, the correct word might be \"dolph-\" with a different last letter that hasn't been tried yet and is valid. Given the constraints, a valid guess could be \"dolphs\".\n\nAnswer: dolphs","From the feedback given, we can deduce that the correct letters are p, o, d, l, and h, but they are all in the wrong positions in the guesses made so far. Since none of these letters have been placed correctly, we need to rearrange them into a new configuration that hasn't been tried yet.\n\nGiven that:\n- p, o, d, l, and h are all in the word but in the wrong spots,\n- We have not used the combination \"dolph\" in the middle positions (1-4) with a different letter at the start or end,\n\nA logical next step would be to try placing one of these letters in the first or last position, which haven't been confirmed as incorrect yet. Let's try placing 'p' at the end and rearrange the rest:\n\nGuess: dolh-p\n\nHowever, since the format requires a 6-letter word without symbols, let's adjust it to a valid guess:\n\nGuess: dolhp-\n\nSince '-' is not a valid character, we need to replace it with a letter that has not been used or confirmed as incorrect. Given the constraints, we might as well try a vowel that hasn't been used much, like 'a':\n\nGuess: dolhap\n\nThis guess places all known correct letters in new positions and adds an 'a' to fill the last spot, which hasn't been confirmed as incorrect and could fit the pattern.\n\nAnswer: dolhap","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, the letters D, O, L, H, and P are all in the word but in the wrong positions. The correct positions for these letters can be deduced as follows:\n\n- D cannot be in position 0, 2, or 3.\n- O cannot be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n- L cannot be in position 0, 1, 2, or 5.\n- H cannot be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n- P cannot be in position 0, 3, or 5.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible arrangement that fits all criteria is \"POLHD\". However, since we know that the letters must be in different positions than previously guessed, we need to rearrange them to fit the correct pattern. A likely solution is \"HOLDP\".\n\nLet's try this as our next guess.\n\nAnswer: HOLDP","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know that the letters P, O, L, D, H are all in the word but in the wrong spots. This means these letters must be rearranged to form the correct word. Since none of the previous guesses have placed these letters correctly, we need to try a new permutation.\n\nGiven the constraints, a logical guess would be to place the letters in a new order that hasn't been tried yet.

Without any history or clues from previous attempts, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact word. However, I can make an educated guess based on common 12-letter location-related words.\n\nLet's try a well-known city name: \"NewYorkCity\".\n\nAnswer: NewYorkCity","Based on the feedback from the first guess, we know that the letters 'n', 'o', 'r', and 'i' are in the word but in different positions. We can try to rearrange these letters and fill in the gaps with other common letters to form a 12-letter word related to a location. A possible guess could be \"northernireland\".\n\nAnswer: northernireland","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we know the following:\n\n- The letters 'n', 'o', 'r', and 'i' are in the word but in the wrong spots.\n- The letter 'r' is correctly placed in the 7th position.\n- The letters 'e', 'w', 'y', 'k', 'c', 't', 'h', 'l' are not in the word.\n\nGiven these constraints, a good guess would be a word that includes 'n', 'o', 'r', and 'i' in different positions than previously guessed, and with 'r' in the 7th position. A possible guess could be \"northernirel\" adjusted to fit the correct placement and avoid incorrect letters. However, since 'northernirel' was already tried, we can rearrange the letters to form a new word. A plausible guess could be \"ironernorin\".\n\nLet's try this guess:\n\nAnswer: ironernorin","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters 'n', 'o', 'r', 'i' are in the word but in different positions than guessed.\n- The letter 'r' at index 6 in the second guess is in the correct position.\n- The letters 'o', 'r', 'i', 'n' in the third guess are in the correct positions at indices 7, 8, 9, 10 respectively.\n\nGiven this information, a good guess would be to place these letters in their correct positions and try to fill in the remaining spots with letters that haven't been tried yet or that fit the pattern of a known location.\n\nA possible guess could be: 'northernirin'\n\nHowever, since we know 'h' and 'e' are not in the word, and we need to place 'n', 'o', 'r', 'i' correctly, a more refined guess would be:\n\n'orionnorirn'\n\nLet's try this as our next guess.\n\nAnswer: orionnorirn","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters 'n', 'o', 'r', 'i' are all in the word but in different positions than guessed.\n- The letter 'r' at index 6 in the second guess is in the correct position.\n- The letter 'o' at index 7 in the third guess is in the correct position.\n- The letter 'i' at index 9 in the third guess is in the correct position.\n- The letter 'n' at index 10 in the third and fourth guesses is in the correct position.\n\nGiven these clues, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"northernirin\". However, since 'northernirin' was already tried and did not match exactly, we need to rearrange the letters to fit the correct positions and ensure no duplicates are in the wrong spots. A good guess would be \"northerniron\", which places all known correct letters in their correct positions and avoids repeating letters incorrectly.\n\nAnswer: northerniron","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters 'n', 'o', 'r', 'i' are all present in the word but in different positions.\n- The letter 'r' is confirmed to be in the correct position at index 6.\n- The letter 'o' is confirmed to be in the correct position at index 7.\n- The letter 'i' is confirmed to be in the correct position at index 8.\n- The letter 'n' is confirmed to be in the correct position at index 10.\n\nGiven these constraints, a logical guess would be to place the known correct letters in their positions and try to fill in the remaining letters with those that have been confirmed to be in the word but are currently in the wrong spots. A possible guess could be:\n\n'northerniron' adjusted to fit the correct positions and avoid incorrect placements, leading to a guess like 'norirnoron'.\n\nLet's try this as our next guess:\n\nAnswer: norirnoron","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters that are confirmed to be in the word and their positions are:\n  - r at idx=6 (confirmed correct position)\n  - o at idx=7 (confirmed correct position)\n  - i at idx=8 (confirmed correct position)\n  - n at idx=10 (confirmed correct position)\n\n- The letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions are:\n  - n (appears multiple times, not at idx=0, 3, 7, 9, 11)\n  - o (appears multiple times, not at idx=1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 11)\n  - r (appears multiple times, not at idx=1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11)\n  - i (appears multiple times, not at idx=0, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11)\n  - e (not present in the word)\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible guess could be rearranging the known letters and trying to fit them into the remaining positions while respecting the feedback:\n\nGuess: norrinorion\n\nThis guess places the known correct letters in their correct positions and attempts to place the other letters in different positions than they were in previous incorrect guesses.\n\nAnswer: norrinorion","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters 'n', 'o', 'r', 'i' are all in the word but in different positions than guessed.\n- The letter 'r' at position 6 is in the correct spot.\n- The letter 'i' at position 9 is in the correct spot.\n- The letter 'n' at position 10 is in the correct spot.\n- The letter 'o' at position 7 is in the correct spot.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible arrangement that fits all the clues is \"northernire\". This places all the correctly identified letters in their correct positions and aligns with the feedback about the other letters being present but in the wrong spots.\n\nAnswer: northernire","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following about the word:\n\n- The letters 'n', 'o', 'r', and 'i' are all present in the word but in different positions than guessed.\n- The letter 'r' is correctly placed at index 6.\n- The letter 'o' is correctly placed at index 7.\n- The letter 'i' is correctly placed at index 8.\n- The letter 'n' is correctly placed at index 10.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible guess that fits all the criteria is \"northernirn\". However, since 't' and 'h' have been confirmed as not being in the word, and we need to place 'n', 'o', 'r', and 'i' in the remaining positions, a better guess would be \"norriroinrn\".\n\nLet's try this guess:\n\nAnswer: norriroinrn","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know that the letters N, O, R, I, and R are all present in the word, with some specific positions confirmed. Specifically, we have:\n\n- N is in the word but not in position 0.\n- O is in the word but not in position 1.\n- R is in the word, specifically in position 6.\n- I is in the word, specifically in position 8.\n- N is in the word, specifically in position 10.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"northernire\". However, since \"northernire\" has already been guessed and did not match, we need to rearrange the letters to fit the remaining clues.

Since this is the first attempt and we don't have any clues from previous guesses, I'll start with a common location-based word.\n\nAnswer: california","Based on the feedback from the first guess, we know that the letters 'a', 'l', 'i', and 'n' are in the word, with 'n' in the correct position at index 7. The letters 'c', 'f', 'o', and 'r' are not in the word. We also know that 'a', 'l', and 'i' are in the word but in the wrong positions.\n\nA good strategy would be to rearrange these letters and try to fill in the unknown spots with common letters that haven't been tried yet. A possible guess could be 'alabamian'.\n\nAnswer: alabamian","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters 'a', 'l', 'i', 'n', and 'm' are in the word but not in their current positions.\n- The letter 'n' is correctly placed at index 7.\n- The letters 'c', 'f', 'o', 'r', and 'b' are not in the word.\n\nFrom the second guess, it appears that 'a', 'l', 'i', and 'm' are repeated, which suggests they might be in different positions. Given that 'n' is already in the correct position, we need to rearrange the other letters.\n\nA possible word that fits these criteria and is a location-based word is \"manhattan\".\n\nLet's try this as our next guess.\n\nAnswer: manhattan","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The word contains the letters a, l, i, n, m, t, and a (from the last guess, the second 't' was also confirmed).\n- The letter 'n' is in the correct position at index 7.\n- The letters c, f, o, r, b, h, and the first 'i' (from the first guess) are not in the word.\n\nFrom the second guess, we know that there are multiple 'a's and 'i's, and they are not in the positions tried so far. From the third guess, we know that 'm' and 't' are also part of the word but not in the positions tried.\n\nA possible arrangement considering all these constraints could be \"alabamian\" with adjustments to the positions of the letters that were not correct.

The letter a appears in the word but not in the first position. The letter l appears in the word but not in the second position. The letter i appears in the word but not in the third or sixth positions. The letter m appears in the word but not in the fifth or sixth positions.\n\nGiven this information, a possible arrangement that fits all the criteria is \"alabamint\" with adjustments for the positions of a, l, i, and m.

Since 'e' is the only letter that is present in the word, we should try to place it in different positions in our next guess. A good strategy would be to choose a word that has 'e' in a different position and also introduces new letters to gather more information.\n\nLet's try the word \"tense\" for the next guess, which places 'e' in the second position and introduces new letters 't', 'n', and 's'.\n\nAnswer: tense","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we know that:\n\n- The letter 'e' appears twice in the word, but not in the first or second positions.\n- The letter 't' is in the word but not in the first position.\n- The letter 's' is in the word and is correctly placed in the fourth position.\n\nGiven this information, a good next guess could be a word that has 'e' in the third and fifth positions, 't' in a position other than the first, and 's' in the fourth position.

It must be an 'n' or 'e' or 's' based on the letters we know are in the word, but since 'n', 'e', and 's' are already placed correctly in other positions, it must be a different letter.\n- The second letter is 'i'.\n- The fourth letter is 'n'.\n- The fifth letter is 'e'.\n- The sixth letter is 's'.\n- The eighth letter is 'i'.\n\nGiven these constraints and the fact that 'n' appears twice in the word (once in the correct position and once in the wrong position), and considering the common words that fit this pattern, a good guess would be \"indonesia\". However, since \"indonesia\" has been tried and did not fit all criteria, we need to adjust the placement of the letters.\n\nA logical guess would be to try placing 'n' in the first position and adjusting the other letters accordingly. A possible word that fits all the given criteria is \"ninesies\".\n\nGuess: ninesies\nAnswer: ninesies","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters that are confirmed to be in the word and in the correct spots are: `i` at index 1, `n` at index 4, `e` at index 5, `s` at index 6, and `s` at index 7.\n- The letters that are in the word but in the wrong spots are: `n` (appears more than once, likely at index 0 or 2), `i` (likely at index 0 or 2), and `e` (likely at index 0 or 2).\n- The letters that are not in the word are: `m`, `o`, `u`, `t`, `a`, `f`, `d`, `g`, `o`, `d`, `n`, `o`, `d`.\n\nGiven this information, a good guess would be to place the confirmed letters in their correct positions and try to fit the other known letters into the remaining slots. A possible guess could be:\n\n**insinues**\n\nThis guess places the known correct letters in their spots and tries to fit the other known letters (`n`, `i`, `e`) into the remaining slots.\n\nAnswer: insinues","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following about the target word:\n\n- The word contains the letters i, n, e, s, with i at position 1 and s at position 7.\n- The letter n appears twice, and one of them is correctly placed at position 4.\n- The letter e appears twice, and one of them is correctly placed at position 5.\n- The letters m, o, u, t, a, f, d, g, o, d, u are not in the word.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"insinues\" but since it was already guessed and did not match, we need to rearrange the letters to fit the correct positions. A likely candidate is \"inessins,\" but since this is not a valid English word, we need to consider other possibilities.\n\nA valid word that fits all the criteria is \"innesies.\"\n\nAnswer: innesies","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters 'n', 'e', 's', and 'i' are all in the word.\n- 'n' is in the correct spot at index 4.\n- 'e' is in the correct spot at index 5.\n- 's' is in the correct spot at index 6.\n- 'i' is in the correct spot at index 1.\n- We need to place the remaining 'n' and 'i' in the correct spots, and find the correct letters for the remaining positions.\n\nGiven the constraints and the letters that need to be placed, a logical guess would be \"insinise\" (with the 'n' at index 3 and the 'i' at index 0).\n\nAnswer: insinise","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following about the target word:\n\n- The word contains the letters i, n, e, s.\n- The letter 'n' is correctly placed at index 4.\n- The letter 'e' is correctly placed at index 5.\n- The letter 's' is correctly placed at index 6.\n- The letter 'i' is correctly placed at index 1.\n- The letters 'm', 'o', 't', 'a', 'f', 'd', 'g', 'u', '-' are not in the word.\n- The letters 'i', 'n', 'e', 's' appear more than once but not all in their guessed positions.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"indonesia\" without the last 'i' as it seems to be a repetition error from the guess. However, since the word length is 8 and we need to fit all conditions, the correct guess would be:\n\nAnswer: indonesi","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The word contains the letters i, n, e, s, and i again.\n- The letter 'i' is in the word but not at index 0 or 7.\n- The letter 'n' is in the word but not at index 1 or 2.\n- The letter 'e' is in the word but not at index 3 or 6.\n- The letter 's' is in the word and is correctly placed at index 6.\n- The letter 'n' is correctly placed at index 4.\n- The letter 'e' is correctly placed at index 5.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"sinensis\".

Since this is the first attempt, we don't have any history to guide us, so we should start with a common or well-known location that fits the letter count.\n\nLet's try \"San Francisco\" as our first guess.\n\nAnswer: SanFrancisco","Based on the feedback from the first attempt, we know that the word contains the letters a, n, r, a, n, c, and c, with 'a' being in the correct position at index 1. The letters 'n', 'r', 'a', 'n', 'c', and 'c' are all present but in different positions than guessed. We can try rearranging these letters while keeping 'a' in its correct position.\n\nA possible guess could be \"anarcronica\" (though it's a bit of a stretch as it's not a common word, it fits the pattern given the constraints).\n\nAnswer: anarcronica","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The word contains the letters a, n, r, c, and o.\n- The letters a, n, r, and c appear more than once.\n- The positions of c (at index 4) and n (at index 7) are correct.\n- The letters s, f, i, and the second c and s from \"sanfrancisc\" are not in the word.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits the criteria is \"anacronica,\" but since \"anarcronica\" was already tried and did not fit all the criteria, we need to adjust the position of the letters. A plausible guess could be \"anacronica\" with the correct placement of 'c' and 'n', and adjusting other letters accordingly.\n\nLet's try \"anacronica\" with the correct placements of known letters:\n\nGuess: anacronica\n\nHowever, since \"anarcronica\" was already guessed and incorrect, we need to rearrange the letters while keeping the known correct positions of 'c' and 'n'. A better guess might be \"anacronica\" with adjustments to the positions of 'a', 'r', and 'o'.\n\nGuess: anacronica\n\nSince \"anarcronica\" was close but incorrect, let's try a slight adjustment:\n\nGuess: anacronica\n\nAfter reviewing the feedback and the previous guesses, the best guess considering the correct positions and the letters that are confirmed to be in the word is:\n\nAnswer: anacronica","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The word contains the letters a, n, c, r, o, and n.\n- The positions of some letters are known:\n  - a is in the word but not at position 0, 2, 5, or 9.\n  - n is in the word but not at position 1, 2, 6, or 9.\n  - c is in the word and is correctly placed at position 4.\n  - r is in the word but not at position 3, 5, or 4.\n  - o is in the word and is correctly placed at position 5.\n  - n is in the word and is correctly placed at position 7.\n  - c is in the word but not at position 3, 8, or 9.\n  - a is in the word but not at position 0, 2, 5, or 9.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"characterization\". Let's try this as our next guess.\n\nAnswer: characterization","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters that are confirmed to be in the word and in the correct position are: a (idx=1), c (idx=4), n (idx=7), o (idx=5).\n- The letters that are confirmed to be in the word but in the wrong positions are: a (appears multiple times), n, r, c, t.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible guess could be rearranging the known letters into a valid word. A likely candidate is \"characterization\" without the 'z' at the end, which would be \"characterisat\". However, since the word must be 11 letters long and we know 'z' is not part of it, we need to adjust our guess to fit the correct pattern.\n\nA good guess considering all the feedback would be \"characterisa\", but since this is not a complete word, we might need to consider another common ending. Given the letters we have and their positions, a plausible guess is \"characterisaN\" (with N being a placeholder for the correct letter, which is likely 'n' due to its frequency in the word).\n\nLet's try \"characterisaN\" as our next guess.\n\nAnswer: characterisaN","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The word has 11 letters.\n- The letter 'a' appears multiple times but not in positions 0, 5, 9, or 10.\n- The letter 'n' appears but not in positions 1, 6, or 9.\n- The letter 'r' appears but not in positions 3, 5, or 8.\n- The letter 'c' appears twice but not in positions 0, 5, 8, or 10.\n- The letter 'o' is confirmed to be in position 5.\n- The letter 't' is in the word but not in position 6.\n- The letters 's', 'f', 'i', 'h', 'e', 'z', and '-' are not in the word.\n\nFrom these clues, a possible arrangement could be: **_a_r_oca_r_c**. To fill in the remaining blanks, we need to consider common words that fit this pattern. A likely candidate is \"characterization\" without the 'z' at the end, which would be \"characterisat\".\n\nHowever, since 's' and 'z' are not in the word, and we need to fit the pattern correctly, the best guess would be \"characterization\" without the 'z' and adjusting for the correct placement of 't'.\n\nGiven the constraints and the pattern, my guess for this round is:\n\nAnswer: characterization","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters 'a', 'n', 'r', 'c', 'o', and 't' are in the word but not necessarily in the positions they were guessed.\n- The letters 'c' and 'n' are confirmed to be in the correct spots at index 4 and 7 respectively.\n- The letters 's', 'f', 'i', 'h', 'e', 'z', and '-' are not in the word.\n\nGiven these constraints, a logical guess would be to rearrange the letters that are known to be in the word while placing 'c' and 'n' in their correct spots. A possible guess could be \"character\".\n\nLet's try \"character\" as the next guess.\n\nAnswer: character","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following about the target word:\n\n- The word contains the letters a, n, c, r, o, t, and r.\n- The letter a appears at least twice and is correctly placed at index 1.\n- The letter n is in the word but not at index 2.\n- The letter c is correctly placed at index 4.\n- The letter r is correctly placed at index 7.\n- The letter o is correctly placed at index 5.\n- The letter t is in the word but not at index 6.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"characterization\" without the last 'z' or 's'. Since we know 'i' and 'z'\/'s' are not in the word, and we need to fit the remaining letters into the correct spots, a logical guess would be \"character\":\n\n- c (in the word but in the wrong spot)\n- h (not in the word)\n- a (in the word but in the wrong spot)\n- r (in the word but in the wrong spot)\n- a (in the word but in the wrong spot)\n- c (in the word but in the wrong spot)\n- t (in the word but in the wrong spot)\n- e (not in the word)\n- r (correctly placed at index 7)\n\nHowever, since we need to fill the entire 11-letter word and we know 'a' is correctly placed at index 1, 'c' at index 4, 'o' at index 5, and 'r' at index 7, a more fitting guess would be \"characterize\" without the 'z' or 's', which gives us \"characterise\" as a potential solution, but since 'i' is not in the word, we need to adjust. A better guess considering all constraints would be:\n\n**Answer: characterization**","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following about the target word:\n\n- The word contains the letters a, n, r, c, o, t, and n.\n- The positions of some letters are known: a is in position 1, c is in position 4, n is in position 7, and o is in position 5.\n- Letters that are confirmed not to be in the word include s, f, i, h, e, z, and -.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"characterization\" without the last 'z'. Since 'z' has been confirmed not to be in the word, and we need to fit the word length of 11, a suitable guess would be \"characterino\" or a similar variation. However, since \"characterization\" minus 'z' and plus a common ending like 'o' fits well, let's try \"characterino\".\n\nAnswer: characterino","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters 'a', 'n', 'r', 'c', and 't' are all in the word but in different positions than guessed.\n- The letter 'o' is confirmed to be in the correct position at index 5.\n- The letter 'n' is also confirmed to be in the correct position at index 7.\n- The letter 's' is not in the word.\n- The letters 'h', 'e', 'i', 'z', and '-' are not in the word.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible arrangement that fits all the criteria is \"characterization\" without the 'i' and 'z', and with the correct placement of 'o' and 'n'. However, since 'i' is not in the word, we need to replace it with another letter that hasn't been tried yet and fits the pattern.

Since this is the first attempt, I will choose a common location-based term that fits the criteria.\n\nAnswer: countryside","Based on the feedback from the first guess, we know that the letters 'n', 't', 'r', 'y', and 'e' are in the word but in the wrong spots. We need to rearrange these letters and consider other possible letters that could fit into an 11-letter word related to a location.\n\nA good guess would be to try a word that includes these letters and fits the criteria of being a location. One such word could be \"environment\".\n\nAnswer: environment","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we know the following:\n\n- The letters 'n', 't', 'r', 'y', and 'e' are in the word but not in their respective positions in \"countryside.\"\n- From \"environment,\" we know that 'e' is in the correct position at index 0, 'r' is in the correct position at index 4, and 'e' is also in the correct position at index 8.\n- 'n' appears twice and is in the word but not in the positions 1 or 6 in \"environment.\"\n- 't' and 'y' are in the word but not in the positions 4 and 6 in \"countryside.\"\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible guess could be \"entrypoint,\" which fits all the criteria provided.\n\nAnswer: entrypoint","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters 'n', 't', 'r', 'y', and 'e' are all in the word, with some in the correct positions.\n- 't' is in the correct position at index 2.\n- 'r' is in the correct position at index 4.\n- 'e' is in the correct position at index 8.\n- 'n' and 't' appear more than once, and their positions need to be determined.\n\nGiven the constraints, a good guess would be to place 'n' and 't' in the remaining possible positions and fill in the gaps with other known letters or common vowels\/consonants that haven't been ruled out yet.\n\nA possible guess could be \"entertaining\".\n\nAnswer: entertaining","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know the following about the target word:\n\n- It has 11 letters.\n- The letters confirmed in the correct positions are: t (idx=2), e (idx=3), r (idx=4), a (idx=6).\n- The letters that are in the word but in the wrong spots include: n (appears twice), t (appears twice), e (appears twice), r, y.\n- Letters that are not in the word include: c, o, u, s, i, d, v, i, o, m, p, o, i, n, -.\n\nGiven these constraints, a good guess would be a word that fits all the criteria.

Since there's no history or additional clues, I'll start with a broad term that can be associated with various places.\n\nAnswer: landscape","Based on the feedback from the first attempt, we know that:\n- 'a' is in the correct spot at index 1.\n- 'd' is in the word but in the wrong spot.\n- Another 'a' is in the word but in the wrong spot.\n\nGiven this information, let's try a word that fits these criteria. A possible guess could be \"admiral\" since it contains two 'a's and a 'd', and it fits the pattern observed.\n\nAnswer: admiralty","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The word contains two 'a's, one in the correct position (idx=1) and one in the wrong position.\n- 'd' is in the word but in the wrong position (it was guessed at idx=3 and idx=1).\n- 'm' and 'i' are in the word but in the wrong positions.\n- 'l' and 'r' are not in the word.\n\nGiven that 'a' is correctly placed at idx=1 and another 'a' needs to be placed elsewhere, and considering the positions of 'd', 'm', and 'i', a possible guess could be rearranging these letters to fit the criteria. A logical guess would be to place 'd' at idx=0, 'a' at idx=1, 'm' at idx=2, 'i' at idx=3, and the second 'a' at idx=5 or idx=6. Since 'd' cannot be at idx=3 and 'a' cannot be at idx=6, let's try placing 'a' at idx=5.\n\nGuess: damaged\n\nAnswer: damaged","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know that the word contains the letters a, d, m, and e, with a and d in their correct positions. The letter m appears twice, and both instances are in the wrong spots. The letter e is also in the word but in the wrong spot. We can try to place these letters in different positions while keeping a and d fixed.\n\nA possible guess could be \"damaged\" rearranged to fit the constraints, such as \"admeand.\"\n\nLet's try \"admeand\" for this attempt.\n\nAnswer: admeand","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know the following:\n\n- The word has an 'a' in the second position.\n- There is a 'd' in the first position.\n- There is an 'm' and an 'e', but both are in the wrong positions.\n- Another 'a' is present but also in the wrong position.\n- A second 'd' is also in the word but in the wrong position.\n\nGiven the constraints, a possible word that fits all these criteria is \"damaged\" but with the letters rearranged to fit the correct positions identified. Since \"damaged\" was already tried and did not solve the puzzle, we need to rearrange the letters to ensure they fit the clues better. One such arrangement could be \"dameada,\" but since 'n' was confirmed not to be in the word, we need to adjust. Considering the clues, a better guess would be \"dameade.\"\n\nLet's try \"dameade\" as it places the known letters in different positions while adhering to the given clues.\n\nAnswer: dameade","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The word starts with \"da\" (from guesses 3 and 5).\n- There is an \"m\" in the word, but it's not in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th positions (from guesses 2, 3, and 5).\n- There is an \"e\" in the word, but it's not in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th positions (from guesses 2, 3, and 5).\n- The word ends with \"e\" (from guess 5).\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"damaged\" but with the \"m\" and \"e\" in different positions. A likely candidate is \"dameade,\" but since \"n\" is not in the word and \"a\" is already used twice, we need to find a word that fits all the criteria and hasn't been guessed yet.\n\nA possible word that fits all the criteria is \"damaged\" but rearranged to fit the new positions for \"m\" and \"e.\" Since \"damaged\" was already guessed and didn't fit, let's try \"dameade\" with the \"m\" and \"e\" in different positions. However, since \"dameade\" was also guessed, we need to think of another possibility.\n\nConsidering all the constraints and the letters we know, a good guess would be \"dameade\" with the \"m\" and \"e\" in different positions, but since that was already guessed, we need to think of another word. Given the constraints, a possible word is \"dameled.\"\n\nLet's try \"dameled.\"\nAnswer: dameled","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know that:\n\n- The word starts with \"da\" and ends with \"e\".\n- \"m\" is in the word but not in the 3rd position.\n- \"e\" appears twice, one of which is in the 6th position, and the other is not in the 3rd or 5th position.\n- \"a\" appears twice, one of which is in the 1st position, and the other is not in the 4th position.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"damaged\" but since it has already been guessed, we need another option. Considering the positions and letters, a plausible guess would be \"dameade\" but since \"l\" was tried and did not work, we can try rearranging the known letters to fit the pattern. A new guess could be \"dameade\" but since it has also been tried, we need to think of another combination. \n\nA good guess considering all the rules and previous attempts could be \"damaged\" but since it's already been used, let's try \"damedae\".\n\nAnswer: damedae","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters 'd', 'a', and 'e' are correctly placed at positions 0, 1, and 6, respectively.\n- The letter 'm' is in the word but not in position 2.\n- The letter 'e' appears twice in the word, with one instance at position 6 and the other in an unknown position.\n- The letter 'a' appears twice in the word, with one instance at position 1 and the other in an unknown position.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"damaged\" but with the letters rearranged to fit the correct positions. However, since \"damaged\" has already been guessed and did not fit all the criteria, we need to find another word. A suitable guess would be \"dameade\" but with the 'm' and 'e' in different positions. Since 'm' cannot be in position 2 and 'e' cannot be in position 3 or 5, a logical guess would be:\n\nAnswer: dammead","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know the following about the target word:\n\n- The word starts with \"da\" and ends with \"e\".\n- The letters \"m\" and \"e\" appear more than once, and both are misplaced in previous guesses.\n- \"d\", \"a\", \"m\", and \"e\" are confirmed to be in the word.\n\nFrom the pattern and the letters that are confirmed to be in the word, a possible guess could be \"damaged\" again, but since it has already been used and did not fit all criteria, we need to rearrange the letters to fit the pattern better. A logical guess considering the positions and the requirement for two 'm's and two 'e's would be \"dameame\".\n\nHowever, since \"dameame\" might not be a valid word, let's try another arrangement that fits the criteria and is a valid word: \"dameemd\".\n\nLet's go with \"dameemd\" as our next guess.\n\nAnswer: dameemd","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters 'd', 'a', and 'e' are in the correct spots at indices 0, 1, and 6 respectively.\n- The letters 'm' and 'e' are in the word but in the wrong spots. From the last guess, we know that 'm' is correctly placed at index 5.\n- The remaining positions (indices 3 and 4) must be filled with the letters 'e' and 'a' or 'a' and 'e', as they are both in the word but in the wrong spots.\n\nGiven this information, the word should be \"damemae\".\n\nAnswer: damemae"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

We can try a word that fits these criteria.\n\nGuess: arcade\n\nAnswer: arcade","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. The word starts with \"a\" (confirmed from both guesses).\n2. The second letter is \"r\" (confirmed from the second guess).\n3. The fifth letter is \"a\" (from the first guess, but it's in the wrong position in the second guess, so it must be in the fifth position).\n4. The sixth letter is \"l\" (confirmed from the first guess).\n5. The fourth letter is \"a\" (from the second guess, but it's in the wrong position, so it must be in the fourth position).\n6. The seventh letter is \"e\" (from the second guess, but it's in the wrong position, so it must be in the seventh position).\n\nGiven these deductions, the word should be \"ararale\". However, since \"ararale\" doesn't seem like a valid word, let's recheck the positions and try to find a more plausible word that fits all the criteria.\n\nConsidering the constraints and the typical structure of words, a possible guess could be \"arabale\" or \"arabile\". Since \"arabile\" is a more common term (meaning able or capable in an archaic sense), it seems like a better fit.\n\nTherefore, my guess for this round is:\n\nAnswer: arabile","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The word starts with \"ar\" (a at index 0 and r at index 1 are correct).\n- There is another \"a\" in the word, but it's not in the third position (from the first and third guesses).\n- \"l\" is in the word but not in the sixth position (from the first guess).\n- \"e\" is in the word but not in the sixth position (from the second and third guesses).\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"aralale\". However, since \"l\" and \"e\" need to be in different positions than previously guessed, and considering common English words, a better guess would be \"aralele\".\n\nAnswer: aralele","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The word starts with \"ar\".\n- There is an \"a\" that is correctly placed at index 0.\n- There is an \"r\" that is correctly placed at index 1.\n- There is an \"a\" that needs to be placed elsewhere, not at index 2 or 3.\n- There is an \"l\" that is correctly placed at index 6.\n- Another \"l\" and \"e\" need to be placed elsewhere, not at their current positions in the previous guesses.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"araleel\". However, since \"araleel\" was already tried and did not fit all the criteria, we need to rearrange the letters \"a\", \"l\", and \"e\" to find a valid word. A plausible guess would be \"araleel\" rearranged to ensure all letters are in the correct spots as per the feedback.\n\nLet's try \"arealle\":\n\n- \"a\" at index 0 (correct)\n- \"r\" at index 1 (correct)\n- \"e\" at index 2 (not tried yet in this position)\n- \"a\" at index 3 (not tried yet in this position)\n- \"l\" at index 4 (not tried yet in this position)\n- \"l\" at index 5 (correct)\n- \"e\" at index 6 (correct)\n\nAnswer: arealle","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following about the target word:\n\n- The first letter is 'a'.\n- The second letter is 'r'.\n- The letters 'a', 'l', and 'e' are present but not in their current positions in the last guess 'arealle'.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible arrangement that fits all the criteria is 'araleal'. Let's try this as our next guess.\n\nAnswer: araleal","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The word starts with \"ar\".\n- The third position must be an 'e' because it's the only letter left that hasn't been confirmed in the right place and was marked as in the word but in the wrong spot.\n- The fourth position must be an 'a' for the same reason.\n- The fifth position must be an 'l'.\n- The sixth position is confirmed to be an 'a'.\n- The seventh position is confirmed to be an 'l'.\n\nSo, the word should be \"arealla\". However, since 'e' needs to be in a different position than the third, and considering all the constraints, the correct word should be \"arealal\".\n\nAnswer: arealal","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know the following:\n\n- The word starts with \"ar\".\n- The letters 'a', 'r', 'e', and 'l' are all present in the word.\n- 'a' is correctly placed at index 0 and 5.\n- 'r' is correctly placed at index 1.\n- 'l' is correctly placed at index 6.\n- 'e' is in the word but not in the positions tried so far (2, 4).\n\nGiven this information, the only position left for 'e' is index 3. Therefore, the word must be \"arealal\" but with 'e' in the correct position, which would be \"arealel\".\n\nAnswer: arealel","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following about the word:\n\n- The first letter is 'a'.\n- The second letter is 'r'.\n- The fifth letter is 'a'.\n- The seventh letter is 'l'.\n- The letters 'e' and 'l' are present but not in their guessed positions.\n\nFrom the last guess \"arealel\", we know that 'e' and 'l' are misplaced, and since 'l' is already correctly placed at the end, 'e' must go somewhere else. Given that 'a' and 'r' are fixed at the beginning, and 'a' and 'l' are fixed at the end, the remaining letters 'e', 'l', and another 'a' need to be placed in the middle three spots (positions 3, 4, and 5).\n\nSince 'e' and 'l' cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 as they were in the last guess, and we know 'a' is already in position 5, the only logical placement is to put 'e' in position 3 and 'l' in position 4, which leaves 'a' in position 5 as it was confirmed.\n\nThus, the word is likely \"araleal\".\n\nHowever, since \"araleal\" has already been tried and did not fully match, and considering the feedback, the correct placement might be slightly different. Given the constraints, the most likely correct word is \"aralela\" with the 'e' and 'l' swapped in the middle.\n\nAnswer: aralela","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following about the word:\n\n- The word starts with \"ar\" (a at idx=0 and r at idx=1).\n- There are two 'a's, one at idx=0 and one at idx=5.\n- There are two 'l's, one at idx=5 and one at idx=6.\n- The letters 'e' and 'l' are present but not in their current positions in the last few guesses.\n\nGiven these constraints, the only arrangement that fits all the criteria is \"aralale\". This places 'e' in the only remaining position (idx=4) that has not been confirmed as correct for any other letter.\n\nAnswer: aralale"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Since this is the first attempt, I'll start with a common 7-letter word that could help reveal some letters that might be part of the target word.\n\nAnswer: landscape","Based on the feedback from the first attempt, we know that the word contains two 'a's, one of which is in the correct position (idx=1), and an 'n' which is in the word but in the wrong position. The letters 'l', 'd', 's', and 'c' are not in the word. A good next guess could be a word that includes 'a' in the second position and 'n' in a different position than it was guessed previously.\n\nGuess: panorama\n\nAnswer: panorama","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we know that:\n\n- The word has an 'a' in the second position.\n- There is an 'n' in the word but not in the third position.\n- There is an 'o' in the word but not in the fourth position.\n- There is an 'r' in the word but not in the fifth position.\n- There is another 'a' in the word but not in the sixth position.\n\nGiven these constraints, a good guess would be a word that fits all these criteria. One possible word that matches these conditions is \"anagram\". Let's try this as our next guess.\n\nAnswer: anagram","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we know the following about the target word:\n\n- It has the letter 'a' in the second position.\n- The letters 'n', 'o', 'r', and another 'a' are in the word but not in their guessed positions.\n- The letters 'l', 'd', 's', 'c', 'p', 'g', and 'm' are not in the word.\n\nGiven these constraints, a good guess would be to rearrange the known letters ('a', 'n', 'o', 'r') into a plausible word that fits the criteria. One such word is \"anorak,\" which fits all the given conditions.\n\nAnswer: anorak","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know that the word contains the letters 'a', 'n', 'o', and 'r', with 'a' correctly placed at index 1. The letters 'l', 'd', 's', 'c', 'p', 'm', 'g', 'k', and '-' are not in the word. We also know that 'n', 'o', and 'r' are in the word but in incorrect positions in the previous guesses.\n\nA possible arrangement that fits all these criteria is \"arizona\". Let's try this as our next guess.\n\nAnswer: arizona","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know the following about the target word:\n\n- It has an 'a' in the second position.\n- It contains 'n', but not in the second or fifth positions.\n- It contains 'o', but not in the third or fourth positions.\n- It contains 'r', but not in the first, third, or fourth positions.\n- It contains 'i' in the third position.\n- It does not contain 'l', 'd', 's', 'c', 'p', 'g', 'm', 'z', or 'k'.\n\nGiven these constraints, a good guess would be a word that fits all the criteria. A possible word that matches these conditions is \"airborn\" (assuming the word is related to being airborne or something similar, and noting that 'b' and 'e' haven't been ruled out yet).\n\nAnswer: airborn","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letter 'a' appears twice and is in the correct spot at index 1.\n- The letter 'n' is in the word but not at index 2 or 5.\n- The letter 'o' is in the word but not at index 3 or 4.\n- The letter 'r' is in the word but not at index 4 or 2.\n- The letter 'i' is in the correct spot at index 2.\n- The letter 'b' is in the word but not at index 3.\n- The letter 'n' is also in the word but not at index 6.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"abrinia\". However, since 'b' is confirmed to be in the word but not at index 3, and we need to place 'n' and 'o' correctly, let's try another arrangement that fits all the given clues: \"airborn\" was close but had 'b' in the wrong spot. Adjusting for this, a better guess might be \"aborion\".\n\nLet's go with \"aborion\" as our next guess.\n\nAnswer: aborion","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The word contains the letters a, n, o, r, i, and b.\n- The letter 'a' is in the word but not in the first position.\n- The letter 'n' is in the word but not in the second or fifth positions.\n- The letter 'o' is in the word and correctly placed in the sixth position.\n- The letter 'r' is in the word but not in the third, fourth, or fifth positions.\n- The letter 'i' is in the word and correctly placed in the third position.\n- The letter 'b' is in the word but not in the second position.\n- The letter 'n' is also in the word but not in the second or fifth positions.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible arrangement that fits all the criteria is \"aborion\" with the correct placement of 'i' and 'o'. However, since 'aborion' was already guessed and did not fit all the criteria (specifically, 'a' and 'n' were not in their correct positions), we need to rearrange the letters while keeping 'i' in the third position and 'o' in the sixth position.\n\nA valid guess that fits all the criteria could be \"bairnon\".\n\nAnswer: bairnon","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know that:\n\n- 'a' is in the correct position at index 1.\n- 'i' is in the correct position at index 2.\n- 'o' is in the correct position at index 5.\n- 'b', 'r', 'n' are all in the word but in the wrong positions.\n- 'a' appears twice, with one in the correct position at index 1 and another in the wrong position.\n\nGiven these constraints, a logical guess would be to place 'b', 'r', and 'n' in different positions than they have been before, while keeping 'a', 'i', and 'o' in their correct or known incorrect positions. A possible arrangement could be:\n\n'abrinio'\n\nThis places 'b', 'r', and 'n' in new positions and keeps the known correct letters in their spots.\n\nAnswer: abrinio","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters 'a', 'r', 'i', 'o', 'n' are all in the word, but some are in the wrong spots.\n- 'a' is correctly placed at index 1.\n- 'i' is correctly placed at index 2.\n- 'o' is correctly placed at index 5.\n- 'b' is in the word but not at index 1.\n- 'r' and 'n' appear more than once, but their exact positions are not yet clear.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible arrangement that fits all the criteria is \"abrinia\". However, since 'n' and 'r' are both in the word and we know 'r' is not in the correct position in previous guesses, we need to rearrange them. A better fit would be \"abrinio\" but since it was already tried and failed, we need to consider another arrangement.\n\nA likely correct answer, considering all the constraints, is \"abirion\".\n\nAnswer: abirion"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

A good starting word could be \"CRANES,\" which includes vowels and consonants that are frequently used in English words.\n\nAnswer: CRANES","Based on the feedback from the first attempt, we know that the letter 'e' is in the word but in the wrong spot. Since 'e' was in position 4 and it's not correct there, we can try placing it in another position. Let's try a new word that includes 'e' in a different position and also contains common letters that might fit the pattern.\n\nGuess: stream\n\nAnswer: stream","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we know that:\n\n- The letter 'e' is in the word but not in the 4th or 5th position.\n- The letter 't' is in the word but not in the 1st or 2nd position.\n\nGiven this information, a good next guess would be a word that places 'e' and 't' in different positions than they were in the previous guesses. A possible word that fits these criteria is \"teeths\" (though \"teeths\" is not a standard English word, it's used here as an example to fit the pattern; a more appropriate guess might be \"thefts\" if we consider common 6-letter words).\n\nHowever, since \"teeths\" is not a valid word, let's consider a valid word like \"thefts\" which also fits the criteria.\n\nAnswer: thefts","Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, we know the following about the target word:\n\n1. It does not contain the letters c, r, a, n, s, m, h, f.\n2. The letter e appears twice, but not in positions 2 or 3.\n3. The letter t appears once in the correct position (idx=4) and once in a different position (not idx=0 or 4).\n\nGiven these constraints, a good guess would be a word that includes e and t in the appropriate positions and does not include any of the excluded letters. A possible guess could be \"betted,\" which fits all the criteria.\n\nAnswer: betted","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letter 'e' appears twice in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n- The letter 't' appears twice, with one 't' in the correct position at index 4.\n- The letters 'c', 'r', 'a', 'n', 's', 'm', 'h', 'f', 'b', and 'd' are not in the word.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"letter\". Let's try this as our next guess.\n\nAnswer: letter","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know that the word contains the letters 'e', 't', and another 't' at index 4. The letters 'c', 'r', 'a', 'n', 's', 'm', 'h', 'f', 'b', 'd', 'l', and 'r' are not in the word. The letters 'e' and 't' appear more than once and are in the wrong spots in previous guesses.\n\nA possible word that fits these criteria is \"settle\". Let's try this as our next guess.\n\nAnswer: settle","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know that the word contains the letters 'e', 't', and another 't' in the fourth position. The letters 'e' and 't' appear more than once and are misplaced in most of the previous guesses. The word does not contain the letters 'c', 'r', 'a', 'n', 's', 'm', 'h', 'f', 'b', 'd', 'l', or 'r'. \n\nGiven this information, a good guess would be a word that fits these criteria. One possible word is \"tetted,\" but since 'd' has already been eliminated, we need to think of another option. A valid guess could be \"mettle,\" but since 'm' and 'l' have also been eliminated, we need to find a word that only includes 'e' and 't' in the positions indicated and does not include any eliminated letters.\n\nA suitable guess could be \"etters\" (though it's not a standard English word, it fits the pattern and avoids eliminated letters). However, since \"etters\" is not a real word, let's consider another possibility that fits all the criteria and is a real word: \"ettins\" (a mythical creature, fitting the criteria but might be a stretch).\n\nHowever, considering the commonality and the likelihood of the word being more familiar, a better guess might be \"etter\" with an additional common vowel or consonant. Since 'i' has not been tried yet and is common, a good guess would be:\n\nAnswer: ettier","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following about the target word:\n\n- The word contains the letters E, T, and I.\n- E is in the first position.\n- T appears twice, but not in the second, third, or fourth positions.\n- I is in the fourth position.\n- E also appears again, but not in the fifth position.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"etitee\" but since \"ee\" at the end seems unlikely, let's try another common word that fits the pattern: \"etited\" doesn't work as D was not in the word before. A more likely candidate is \"etitea\" but A was also ruled out. Another possibility is \"etites\" but S was also ruled out. \n\nA valid word that fits all the criteria and hasn't been ruled out by previous guesses is \"etitee\" but since it looks unusual, let's consider \"etited\" again with the understanding that D might have been a mistake or less likely. However, a more common and fitting word would be \"etitee\" with the assumption that E can repeat in the last position, which is a valid possibility.\n\nHowever, given the constraints and the typical structure of words, \"etitee\" seems to be the best fit, but let's try a more common word that fits all the rules: \"etited\" (assuming the feedback on D might have been an error).\n\nSince \"etited\" is not a real word, and considering all the rules, the most fitting and real word is \"etitee\".\n\nAnswer: etitee","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know the following about the word:\n\n- The word starts with \"e\" (idx=0).\n- There are two \"t\"s, one of which is correctly placed at idx=4.\n- There is an \"i\" at idx=3.\n- The other \"t\" is somewhere in the word but not at idx=1, 2, or 3.\n- The remaining letter must fit into the only remaining position (idx=5).\n\nGiven the constraints, a possible word that fits all these criteria is \"etited\". However, since \"d\" was already tried and did not work, we need another letter that could fit in the last position. A common letter that hasn't been tried yet and fits well in English words is \"d\" but since it's already tried, let's try \"n\".\n\nGuess: etiten\n\nAnswer: etiten","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know the following:\n\n- The word starts with 'e'.\n- The letter 't' appears twice but not in positions 1, 2, or 3.\n- The letter 'i' is in the correct position at index 3.\n- The letters 'a', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'h', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'r', 's', and 'b' are not in the word.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible word that fits all the criteria is \"etitea\". However, since 'a' has been ruled out, we need another vowel or consonant that hasn't been used yet. A plausible guess would be \"etited\" but 'd' has also been ruled out.

A possible guess could be \"coalitiona\".\n\nAnswer: coalitiona","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters 'c', 'o', 'l', 'i', 'n', 'a' are all in the word but in different positions than guessed.\n- The letter 'o' is confirmed to be in the correct position at index 4.\n- The letter 'a' is confirmed to be in the correct position at index 8.\n- The letter 'i' is confirmed to be in the correct position at index 6.\n\nGiven these constraints, a possible arrangement that fits all the criteria is \"coalitiona\" with adjustments to the positions of 'c', 'l', and 'n'. However, since \"coalitiona\" was already tried and did not fit, we need to rearrange the letters while keeping 'o' at index 4, 'i' at index 6, and 'a' at index 8. A plausible guess could be \"congratulai\", but since 'g', 'r', 't', 'u' are not in the word, we need to avoid these letters.\n\nA better guess, considering all the constraints, would be \"congratulai\" without the incorrect letters, which simplifies to a rearrangement like \"congratulai\" but removing 'g', 'r', 't', 'u'. This leaves us with \"colonialia\" but with the correct positions for 'o', 'i', and 'a'. Since \"colonialia\" was also tried, we need a new arrangement.\n\nLet's try \"coalitiona\" again but with a different approach, ensuring we don't repeat the same pattern and considering the feedback:\n\nGuess: \"coalitiona\" (with a slight adjustment to ensure it's a valid guess and not a repeat)\n\nHowever, since \"coalitiona\" was already tried, let's make a slight change to the order while maintaining the correct positions for 'o', 'i', and 'a':\n\nGuess: \"coalitiona\" with a slight adjustment to \"coalitiona\" to ensure it's not a repeat and fits the pattern.\n\nSince \"coalitiona\" was tried and we need a new arrangement, let's try:\n\nGuess: \"colonialia\" with a slight adjustment to \"colonialia\" to ensure it's not a repeat and fits the pattern.\n\nGiven the constraints and the need to avoid repetition, the best guess is:\n\nAnswer: coalitiona","Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know that the letters C, O, A, L, I, N, and O are all present in the word, with some specific positions known:\n\n- The letter 'A' is in the correct position at index 9.\n- The letter 'O' is in the correct position at index 4.\n\nGiven the constraints and the letters that have been confirmed as correct but misplaced, a logical next guess would be to rearrange these letters into a configuration that fits the remaining clues. One such arrangement could be \"coalitiona\", but since it was already guessed, we need to try a different permutation.\n\nLet's try placing 'C', 'O', 'A', 'L', 'I', 'N', and 'O' in a new order while keeping 'O' at index 4 and 'A' at index 9. A possible guess is \"locational\".\n\nGuess: locational\nAnswer: locational","Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letters c, o, l, a, i, n are all present in the word.\n- The letters f, r, g, t, u, - are not present in the word.\n- The letters a and l are in their correct positions at idx=8 and idx=9 respectively.\n- The letters c, o, l, a, i, n need to be rearranged to fit the remaining positions.\n\nGiven that \"a\" and \"l\" are correctly placed at the end, and considering the positions of other letters, a possible arrangement is \"congratulations\" without the \"g\" and \"t\". However, since \"t\" is confirmed not to be in the word, and \"n\" needs to be included, a valid guess would be \"congratulani\" adjusted to fit the correct letters and positions. But since \"t\" is not part of the word, and \"n\" must be included, the correct word should be \"congratulain\" adjusted further to fit the correct pattern. However, since \"t\" is not part of the word, and \"n\" must be included, the correct word should be \"congratulain\" adjusted to fit the correct pattern. Given the constraints and the need to fit the correct pattern, the word \"colonialia\" is close but needs to be adjusted for the correct positions of \"a\" and \"l\" at the end.\n\nThus, the correct guess should be \"colonialal\".\n\nAnswer: colonialal"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
