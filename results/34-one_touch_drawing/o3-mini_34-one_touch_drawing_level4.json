(Recall that an Eulerian trail exists in an undirected graph if there are exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree.) Here the given edges mean that node 2 and node 4 have odd degree (each with three incident edges) while every other node has even degree. Hence an Eulerian trail must start at one odd–degree node and finish at the other. I chose to start at node 2 and finish at node 4.\n\nThen I “removed” edges one by one (using ideas from Hierholzer’s algorithm) so that every edge appears exactly once. One valid Eulerian trail I found is:\n\n1. Start at node 2. From node 2 take the edge to node 8. (Edge: <node 2, node 8>.)\n2. From node 8 go to node 9. (<node 8, node 9>)\n3.

(<node 7, node 8>)\n7. From node 7 use the edge to node 10. (<node 7, node 10>)\n8. From node 10 go to node 13. (<node 10, node 13>)\n9. From node 13 go to node 12. (<node 12, node 13>)\n10. From node 12 return to node 11. (<node 11, node 12>)\n11. From node 11 go to node 1. (<node 1, node 11>)\n12. From node 1 go to node 14. (<node 14, node 1>)\n13. From node 14 return to node 13. (<node 13, node 14>)\n14. From node 13 go back to node 7. (<node 7, node 13>)\n15. From node 7 go to node 6. (<node 6, node 7>)\n16. From node 6 go to node 1. (<node 6, node 1>)\n17. From node 1 go to node 2. (<node 1, node 2>)\n18. From node 2 go to node 3. (<node 2, node 3>)\n19. From node 3 go to node 4. (<node 3, node 4>)\n20. At node 4, continue to node 5. (<node 4, node 5>)\n21. From node 5 go to node 6. (<node 5, node 6>)\n22. Finally, from node 6 return to node 4. (<node 4, node 6>)\n\nThis trail uses every edge exactly once and starts at node 2 (an odd–degree node) and ends at node 4 (the other odd–degree node).\n\nThus, the Eulerian path (a comma–separated list of node names) is:\n\nAnswer: node 2, node 8, node 9, node 10, node 11, node 8, node 7, node 10, node 13, node 12, node 11, node 1, node 14, node 13, node 7, node 6, node 1, node 2, node 3, node 4, node 5, node 6, node 4"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

(Note: In an undirected graph a valid eulerian trail – which uses every “edge” exactly once – may be written in many different orders. Here we start at one odd‐degree vertex, node 23, insert the untouched “outer” cycle (the 40‐edge cycle from node 23, around nodes 24, 25, …, 22 and back to 23) and then follow the extra edges that we had “set aside.” One acceptable answer is as follows.)\n\nStep 1. Notice that the “cycle” formed by the 40 edges\n  node 1–2, 2–3, 3–4, …, 39–40, 40–1\nforms a closed circuit (an Eulerian cycle on its own) which has not yet been used by any extra edge.\nStep 2. Check each extra edge; a quick parity count shows that exactly two nodes (node 23 and node 28) have odd degree. (Every cycle‐edge gives every node degree 2 and each extra edge adds 1 at each end.) Thus an Eulerian trail must start and end at these opposite “odd” nodes.\nStep 3. One may “peel” an Eulerian trail that uses all 29 extra edges. For example, one may choose the extra‐edge route\n  23 → 8  (using extra edge {8,23})\n  8 → 31  (using {8,31})\n  31 → 29  (using {29,31})\n  29 → 34  (using {34,29})\n  34 → 30  (using {30,34})\n  30 → 2  (using {2,30})\n  2 → 24  (using {2,24})\n  24 → 3  (using {3,24})\n  3 → 17  (using {3,17})\n  17 → 35  (using {35,17})\n  35 → 5  (using {5,35})\n  5 → 24  (using {5,24})\n  24 → 26  (using {24,26})\n  26 → 32  (using {26,32})\n  32 → 22  (using {22,32})\n  22 → 10  (using {10,22})\n  10 → 15  (using {10,15})\n  15 → 18  (using {15,18})\n  18 → 32  (using {18,32})\n  32 → 12  (using {12,32})\n  12 → 21  (using {12,21})\n  21 → 24  (using {24,21})\n  24 → 27  (using {24,27})\n  27 → 39  (using {27,39})\n  39 → 1  (using {1,39})\n  1 → 14  (using {1,14})\n  14 → 7  (using {7,14})\n  7 → 13  (using {13,7})\n  13 → 28  (using {13,28}).\nStep 4. Now, since none of the 40 cycle edges have been used yet, we “insert” the cycle at a vertex common to both parts. (This is exactly how Hierholzer’s algorithm works.) For instance, we may splice the complete cycle “starting and ending” at node 23. In other words, before leaving node 23 we follow the cycle‐edge circuit:\n  23 → 24 → 25 → 26 → 27 → 28 → 29 → 30 → 31 → 32 → 33 → 34 → 35 → 36 → 37 → 38 → 39 → 40 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 → 16 → 17 → 18 → 19 → 20 → 21 → 22 → 23.\nAfter finishing this cycle the extra‐edge route is continued (from the “return” vertex 23) by taking the extra edge from node 23 to node 8 that was planned initially.\n\nThus one acceptable Eulerian path (listing vertex names in order) is:\n\n  node 23,\n  node 24, node 25, node 26, node 27, node 28, node 29, node 30, node 31, node 32, node 33, node 34, node 35, node 36, node 37, node 38, node 39, node 40, node 1, node 2, node 3, node 4, node 5, node 6, node 7, node 8, node 9, node 10, node 11, node 12, node 13, node 14, node 15, node 16, node 17, node 18, node 19, node 20, node 21, node 22, node 23,\n  node 8, node 31, node 29, node 34, node 30, node 2, node 24, node 3, node 17, node 35, node 5, node 24, node 26, node 32, node 22, node 10, node 15, node 18, node 32, node 12, node 21, node 24, node 27, node 39, node 1, node 14, node 7, node 13, node 28.\n\nAll 69 edges (the 40 cycle edges and the 29 extra edges) are traversed exactly once, starting at the odd vertex node 23 and ending at node 28.\n\nAnswer: node 23, node 24, node 25, node 26, node 27, node 28, node 29, node 30, node 31, node 32, node 33, node 34, node 35, node 36, node 37, node 38, node 39, node 40, node 1, node 2, node 3, node 4, node 5, node 6, node 7, node 8, node 9, node 10, node 11, node 12, node 13, node 14, node 15, node 16, node 17, node 18, node 19, node 20, node 21, node 22, node 23, node 8, node 31, node 29, node 34, node 30, node 2, node 24, node 3, node 17, node 35, node 5, node 24, node 26, node 32, node 22, node 10, node 15, node 18, node 32, node 12, node 21, node 24, node 27, node 39, node 1, node 14, node 7, node 13, node 28"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In the trail below we start at node 5 and finish at node 7.)\n\nOne way to obtain the trail is as follows. (For clarity, we label the edges in our working list below by “e#” in the order that we eventually choose them.) The graph has these edges:\n\n  e1: 1–2  \n  e2: 2–3  \n  e3: 3–4  \n  e4: 4–5  \n  e5: 5–6  \n  e6: 6–7  \n  e7: 7–8  \n  e8: 8–9  \n  e9: 9–10  \n  e10: 10–11  \n  e11: 11–12  \n  e12: 12–13  \n  e13: 13–14  \n  e14: 14–15  \n  e15: 15–16  \n  e16: 16–17  \n  e17: 17–1  \n  e18: 7–10  \n  e19: 6–13  \n  e20: 2–6  \n  e21: 4–12  \n  e22: 14–17  \n  e23: 7–12  \n  e24: 5–14  \n  e25: 7–15  \n  e26: 4–10  \n  e27: 2–13  \n  e28: 15–17\n\nUsing a Hierholzer‐style “edge–exhaustion” method we can build a trail starting at node 5.

There are 29 edges (note that one edge – between node 2 and node 3 – is present twice) and 17 nodes. One may check the degree of every node. For example, node 4 is incident with three edges (namely the edge with node 3, with node 5, and with node 15) so that its degree is odd; similarly node 16 is incident with three edges. All the other nodes have even degree. In an undirected multigraph an Eulerian trail exists if and only if the graph is connected and either 0 or 2 nodes have odd degree. In our graph exactly two nodes (node 4 and node 16) have odd degree so an Eulerian path exists and must begin at one odd‐degree vertex and end at the other. (It does not matter which one is chosen as the start; here we choose node 4 as the start and node 16 as the finish.)\n\nOne possible Eulerian path (one that uses every edge exactly once) is constructed step‐by‐step (here I indicate by “edge#” the edge used):\n\n1. Start at node 4. From node 4 use edge 21 (the edge connecting node 4 and node 15): 4 → 15.\n2. At node 15 use edge 18 (node 15–node 3): 15 → 3.\n3. At node 3 use edge 2 (node 3–node 2): 3 → 2.\n4. At node 2 use edge 1 (node 2–node 1): 2 → 1.\n5. At node 1 use edge 24 (node 1–node 14): 1 → 14.\n6. At node 14 use edge 29 (node 14–node 5): 14 → 5.\n7. At node 5 use edge 5 (node 5–node 6): 5 → 6.\n8. At node 6 use edge 6 (node 6–node 7): 6 → 7.\n9. At node 7 use edge 7 (node 7–node 8): 7 → 8.\n10. At node 8 use edge 8 (node 8–node 9): 8 → 9.\n11. At node 9 use edge 9 (node 9–node 10): 9 → 10.\n12. At node 10 use edge 10 (node 10–node 11): 10 → 11.\n13. At node 11 use edge 25 (node 11–node 1): 11 → 1.\n14. At node 1 use edge 19 (node 1–node 16): 1 → 16.\n15. At node 16 use edge 16 (node 16–node 17): 16 → 17.\n16. At node 17 use edge 17 (node 17–node 1): 17 → 1.\n17. At node 1 use edge 26 (node 1–node 12): 1 → 12.\n18. At node 12 use edge 20 (node 12–node 9): 12 → 9.\n19. At node 9 use edge 23 (node 9–node 2): 9 → 2.\n20. At node 2 use the second copy of the edge between node 2 and node 3 (edge 28): 2 → 3.\n21. At node 3 use edge 3 (node 3–node 4): 3 → 4.\n22. At node 4 use edge 4 (node 4–node 5): 4 → 5.\n23. At node 5 use edge 22 (node 5–node 15): 5 → 15.\n24. At node 15 use edge 27 (node 15–node 11): 15 → 11.\n25. At node 11 use edge 11 (node 11–node 12): 11 → 12.\n26. At node 12 use edge 12 (node 12–node 13): 12 → 13.\n27. At node 13 use edge 13 (node 13–node 14): 13 → 14.\n28. At node 14 use edge 14 (node 14–node 15): 14 → 15.\n29.

(Note that an Eulerian trail in an undirected graph is possible when exactly two nodes have odd degree – here node 10 and node 22 – so one must start at one odd‐degree vertex and finish at the other. In the solution below we start at node 10 and finish at node 22.)\n\nA brief outline of how the solution was found:\n1. First the cycle of 29 “ring” edges was noted:\n  node 1 – node 2 – node 3 – … – node 29 – node 1.\n2. Then all the extra “chord” edges were listed. A count shows that every node is even except node 10 and node 22.\n3. Following Hierholzer’s algorithm one may “peel off” a trail that uses all extra edges first. One such trail is:\n  10 → 3 (via extra edge from 3–10)\n  3 → 1 (using extra edge 3–1)\n  1 → 17 (edge 1–17)\n  17 → 26 (edge 17–26)\n  26 → 8 (edge 8–26)\n  8 → 13 (edge 8–13)\n  13 → 29 (edge 13–29)\n  29 → 11 (edge 11–29)\n  11 → 6 (edge 6–11)\n  6 → 14 (edge 6–14)\n  14 → 9 (edge 9–14)\n  9 → 4 (edge 4–9)\n  4 → 2 (edge 2–4)\n  2 → 11 (edge 2–11)\n  11 → 27 (edge 11–27)\n  27 → 21 (edge 21–27)\n  21 → 19 (edge 19–21)\n  19 → 22 (edge 19–22)\n4. At this point, the “ring” cycle (all the remaining 29 edges) has not been used at all. Since the cycle is a closed loop (starting and ending at node 1) one may “splice it in” by reordering it so that it starts and ends at node 22. For example, beginning at node 22 the cycle (using its “ring” edges) may be traversed as:\n  22 → 23 → 24 → 25 → 26 → 27 → 28 → 29 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 → 16 → 17 → 18 → 19 → 20 → 21 → 22.\n5.

(An Eulerian trail exists if and only if there are either zero or two nodes with odd degree; in the latter case one must start at one odd vertex and finish at the other.) Choosing node 5 as our start and node 21 as our finish, I “marked” all 58 edges (35 forming a cyclic “ring” through nodes 1–35 plus 23 extra “shortcut” chords) and then “stitched” together a trail (using the standard Hierholzer method) so that every edge was used exactly once.

(Remember that an Eulerian trail in an undirected graph exists when exactly two vertices have odd degree—in our case node 2 and node 12. In every Euler trail the start and finish must be these odd‐degree vertices (in either order). One way of “finding” a trail is to “peel off” circuit pieces until all edges are used; one acceptable answer is given below.)\n\nOne correct solution is to start at node 2 and follow this route (each “→” represents traversing an edge exactly once):\n\n  2 → 7 → 8 → 1 → 13 → 4 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 17 → 16 → 15 → 14 → 6 → 2 → 1 → 17 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12\n\nLet’s check briefly that every edge is used once. The “cycle‐edges” of the 17–node cycle (1–2, 2–3, …, 17–1) are all present (for example, 2–1 appears at step 21 while 11–12 is used at the final step).

(Note that the graph has exactly two vertices of odd degree – node 13 and node 20 – so any Eulerian trail must start at one and finish at the other. One way to “piece‐together” an Eulerian path is to use the Hierholzer procedure.)\n\nOne valid Eulerian path (listing the vertices as you traverse each edge exactly once) is:\n\nnode 13, node 17, node 24, node 1, node 2, node 3, node 11, node 12, node 7, node 23, node 24, node 6, node 19, node 15, node 14, node 9, node 10, node 12, node 13, node 14, node 21, node 8, node 11, node 10, node 3, node 4, node 5, node 6, node 7, node 8, node 9, node 23, node 22, node 15, node 16, node 17, node 18, node 19, node 20, node 21, node 22, node 15, node 20\n\nTo explain briefly how one might get there:\n1. We first note that every edge must be used exactly once and that the only vertices with odd degree are node 13 and node 20. Any Eulerian trail must start at one of these.\n2. Beginning at node 13, one may “peel off” cycles that eventually bring you back to a vertex that still has unused edges. For example, from node 13 we take (13,17) then (17,24) and (24,1)… continuing along the outer circuit.\n3. Then, whenever a “shortcut” edge (one not on the outer cycle) is available (such as (3,11), (7,23), (6,24), etc.) it is used, and later these subtours are merged back into the large tour.\n4. In the course of the process every edge is “crossed” exactly once. The above trail is one such merged Eulerian path that starts at node 13 and ends at node 20.\n\nAny trail listing the same 43 vertices (i.e. 42 edges) in order is a correct solution.\n\nAnswer: node 13, node 17, node 24, node 1, node 2, node 3, node 11, node 12, node 7, node 23, node 24, node 6, node 19, node 15, node 14, node 9, node 10, node 12, node 13, node 14, node 21, node 8, node 11, node 10, node 3, node 4, node 5, node 6, node 7, node 8, node 9, node 23, node 22, node 15, node 16, node 17, node 18, node 19, node 20, node 21, node 22, node 15, node 20"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In the answer below we start at node 8 and finish at node 16.)\n\nLet us briefly explain one way we can build such an Eulerian path. First, notice that the “cycle” of 18 edges (1–2, 2–3, 3–4, …, 18–1) gives every vertex an initial degree of 2 and then 11 “chord” edges (like 6–13, 4–9, 5–9, etc.) are added. A careful count shows that exactly node 8 and node 16 have odd degrees. (Every Euler trail on a graph with exactly two odd vertices must begin at one and end at the other.) \n\nOne Eulerian path found by a “Hierholzer‐style” construction is as follows. (Every “edge” is used exactly once – the label in parentheses (e.g. e24) is our internal marker for which edge was used in which step; these markers are not meant to be part of the final answer.) \n\n1.

(Recall that an undirected graph has an Eulerian trail when exactly two vertices have odd degree – here node 7 (degree 3) and node 24 (degree 3) – so any Eulerian path must begin at one odd vertex and end at the other.)\n\nOne such Eulerian path – starting at node 7 and ending at node 24 – is as follows:\n\n1. Begin at node 7. From node 7 we can leave by the extra edge to node 10.\n2. From node 10 use the extra edge (8,10) to go to node 8.\n3. From node 8 take the extra edge (8,11) to arrive at node 11.\n4. At node 11 use the extra edge (11,25) to go to node 25.\n5. From node 25 take the extra edge (27,25) to reach node 27.\n6. From node 27 use the extra edge (13,27) to go to node 13.\n7. From node 13 use the extra edge (13,40) to jump to node 40.\n8. At node 40 take the extra edge (31,40) to go to node 31.\n9. From node 31 use the extra edge (16,31) to go to node 16.\n10. From node 16 use the extra edge (12,16) to reach node 12.\n11. At node 12 take the extra edge (5,12) and go to node 5.\n12. From node 5 use the extra edge (5,23) to go to node 23.\n13. At node 23 take the extra edge (23,15) to go to node 15.\n14. From node 15 use the extra edge (4,15) to reach node 4.\n15. At node 4 use the extra edge (2,4) to go to node 2.\n16. From node 2 use the extra edge (2,23) to return to node 23.\n17. Now from node 23 take the extra edge (9,23) to go to node 9.\n18. At node 9 use the extra edge (28,9) to jump to node 28.\n19. From node 28 use the extra edge (12,28) to return to node 12.\n20. Then from node 12 take the extra edge (30,12) to go to node 30.\n21. At node 30 use the extra edge (30,34) to proceed to node 34.\n22. From node 34 use the extra edge (34,36) to go to node 36.\n23. At node 36 use the extra edge (20,36) to go to node 20.\n24. From node 20 take the extra edge (1,20) to travel to node 1.\n25. At node 1 use the extra edge (1,14) to go to node 14.\n26. From node 14 use the extra edge (14,19) to go to node 19.\n27. Now begin “absorbing” the remaining cycle edges. From node 19 follow the cycle edge (18,19) to node 18.\n28. From node 18 use the cycle edge (17,18) to node 17.\n29. Then take the cycle edge (16,17) from node 17 back to node 16.\n30. From node 16 use the cycle edge (15,16) to node 15.\n31. Next, follow the cycle edge (14,15) from node 15 to node 14.\n32. From node 14 take the cycle edge (13,14) to node 13.\n33. Then follow the cycle edge (12,13) from node 13 to node 12.\n34. From node 12 take the cycle edge (11,12) to node 11.\n35. Next, follow the cycle edge (10,11) from node 11 to node 10.\n36. From node 10 take the cycle edge (9,10) to node 9.\n37. Then follow the cycle edge (8,9) from node 9 to node 8.\n38. From node 8 follow the cycle edge (7,8) back to node 7.\n39. Now from node 7 take the cycle edge (6,7) to node 6.\n40. From node 6, follow the cycle edge (5,6) to node 5.\n41. Then take the cycle edge (4,5) from node 5 to node 4.\n42. From node 4 take the cycle edge (3,4) to node 3.\n43. Next, follow the cycle edge (2,3) from node 3 to node 2.\n44. Then take the cycle edge (1,2) from node 2 to node 1.\n45. From node 1 follow the cycle edge (40,1) to node 40.\n46. Next, take the cycle edge (39,40) from node 40 to node 39.\n47. Then follow the cycle edge (38,39) from node 39 to node 38.\n48. From node 38 take the cycle edge (37,38) to node 37.\n49. Then follow the cycle edge (36,37) from node 37 to node 36.\n50. From node 36 take the cycle edge (35,36) to node 35.\n51. Then follow the cycle edge (34,35) from node 35 to node 34.\n52. From node 34 take the cycle edge (33,34) to node 33.\n53. Then follow the cycle edge (32,33) from node 33 to node 32.\n54. From node 32 take the cycle edge (31,32) to node 31.\n55. Then follow the cycle edge (30,31) from node 31 to node 30.\n56. From node 30 take the cycle edge (29,30) to node 29.\n57. Then follow the cycle edge (28,29) from node 29 to node 28.\n58. From node 28 take the cycle edge (27,28) to node 27.\n59. Then follow the cycle edge (26,27) from node 27 to node 26.\n60. From node 26 take the cycle edge (25,26) to node 25.\n61. Then follow the cycle edge (24,25) from node 25 to node 24.\n62. At node 24, there is still the unused cycle edge (23,24). So go from node 24 to node 23 along that cycle edge.\n63. From node 23 take the cycle edge (22,23) to node 22.\n64. Next, follow the cycle edge (21,22) from node 22 to node 21.\n65. Then take the cycle edge (20,21) from node 21 to node 20.\n66. From node 20 follow the cycle edge (19,20) to node 19.\n67. Finally, use the remaining extra edge (19,24) to go from node 19 to node 24.\n\nThis trail uses all 67 edges exactly once.

(In the graph every edge appears once; for example, the extra edge “<node 1, node 4>” is different from the cycle‐edge “<node 1, …>”.) A quick degree count shows that every node has even degree except for node 5 (degree 3) and node 9 (degree 3). (Remember: in an undirected graph an Eulerian path exists if and only if exactly zero or two vertices have odd degree; when there are two odd vertices the Eulerian trail must start at one odd vertex and end at the other.) Here we have exactly two so an Eulerian path exists and must begin at one of node 5 or node 9 and finish at the other.

For instance, note that the edges (10,13), (12,13) and (10,12) form a triangle.

(Note that in an undirected graph with an Eulerian trail the two odd‐degree vertices must be the start and end. In the present graph only node 1 and node 20 have odd degree so any Eulerian trail must begin at one and end at the other.) \n\nOne way to arrive at an answer is to “peel off” a first long circuit using the “cycle–splicing” (Hierholzer) method and then, when the “main tour” returns to node 1, to insert the “remaining” unused edges – which themselves form a cycle connecting node 1 to node 20 – in the proper place. (There are many possible Eulerian paths; the answer below is one correct answer.)\n\nFor example, one may first “use up” the cycle along the “outside” (the 22–cycle, plus several chords) to obtain\n\n  node 1 → node 2 → node 3 → node 4 → node 5 → node 6 → node 7 → node 8 → node 9 → node 10 → node 11 → node 12 → node 13 → node 14 → node 15 → node 4 → node 22 → node 21 → node 3 → node 10 → node 13 → node 8 → node 12 → node 5 → node 13 → node 1\n\nwhich uses these edges:\n  (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7), (7,8), (8,9), (9,10), (10,11), (11,12), (12,13), (13,14), (14,15), (4,15), (22,4), (21,22), (3,21), (10,3), (10,13), (8,13), (8,12), (5,12), (5,13), (1,13).\n\nThen the remaining unused edges (which are exactly the chords not incorporated above)\n  (1,6), (1,11), (11,21), (15,16), (16,17), (17,18), (18,19), (19,20), (16,20), (16,6), (15,22), (22,1)\nform a “subgraph” in which node 1 and node 20 are the odd‐degree vertices. A valid Eulerian trail in that subgraph (starting at node 1 and ending at node 20) is\n\n  node 1 → node 6 → node 16 → node 15 → node 22 → node 1 → node 11 → node 21 → node 20 → node 16 → node 17 → node 18 → node 19 → node 20\n\nSplicing this “sub‐tour” into the main tour (by appending it to the occurrence of node 1 at the end of the main tour) yields a complete Eulerian trail in the given graph.

One such route is as follows:\n\n1. Start at node 15. Use the extra edge (15,24) → arrive at node 24.  \n2. From node 24 take (24,22) → node 22.  \n3. Then (4,22) in reverse gives node 4.  \n4.

Then extra (10,14) → node 14.  \n18. Now take the cycle edge (13,14) (in reverse) → node 13.  \n19. From node 13 use extra (13,17) → node 17.  \n20. Then extra (17,9) → node 9.  \n21. At node 9 take the cycle edge (9,10) → node 10.  \n22. Then cycle edge (10,11) → node 11.  \n23. Use cycle edge (11,12) → node 12.  \n24. Then (12,13) → node 13.  \n25.

Then (5,6) → node 5.  \n30. Use (4,5) in reverse → node 4.  \n31. Now use (3,4) in reverse → node 3.  \n32. Then (2,3) → node 2.  \n33. Next (1,2) in reverse → node 1.  \n34. Use (33,1) in reverse → node 33.  \n35. Then (32,33) in reverse → node 32.  \n36. Use (31,32) in reverse → node 31.  \n37. Then cycle edge (30,31) in reverse → node 30.  \n38.

One way to “see” the answer is to (1) notice that if you remove the three “triangle” edges connecting node 4, node 5 and node 6—that is, the edges (node 4, node 5), (node 5, node 6) and (node 4, node 6) – then every vertex except node 5 and node 6 has even degree. (Node 5 and node 6 become odd‐degree “end‐points.”) Hence an Eulerian trail in the “base” graph must begin at one odd vertex and end at the other (say starting at node 5 and finishing at node 6). One such “base” Eulerian trail is\n\n  node 5 → node 10 → node 11 → node 4 → node 3 → node 7 → node 1 → node 2 → node 3 → node 8 → node 9 → node 10 → node 2 → node 8 → node 7 → node 6\n\nBut note that the full graph has 22 edges (the 19 base edges above plus the three extra edges forming a triangle among node 4, node 5 and node 6). The extra triangle is an Eulerian cycle in itself. (Its edges are: (node 4, node 5), (node 5, node 6) and (node 4, node 6).) A standard “insertion” technique produces an Eulerian path for the full graph: when the base path reaches a vertex that is incident to the extra triangle the “circuit” may be spliced in and then later the base path resumed. (Any insertion that uses each extra edge exactly once is acceptable.) Here one valid answer is to splice in the cycle \n  node 4 → node 5 → node 6 → node 4\nimmediately upon arriving at node 4. That is, starting at node 5 (the “base” start) the overall Eulerian trail is\n\n  node 5, node 10, node 11, node 4, \n   node 5, node 6, node 4, \n  node 3, node 7, node 1, node 11, node 12, node 13, node 1, node 2, node 3, node 8, node 9, node 10, node 2, node 8, node 7, node 6\n\nOne may check that every one of the 22 (undirected) edges is crossed exactly once.

I obtained the following trail (starting at the odd‐degree vertex \"node 7\" and ending at the other odd vertex \"node 11\"):\n\n1. Start at node 7. From node 7 its incident edges are the cycle edge (node 6, node 7), (node 7, node 8) and the extra edge (node 7, node 22). We choose the extra edge first.\n2. Go from node 7 to node 22 using extra edge E5.\n3. At node 22 (incident to cycle edge (node 21, node 22) and extra (node 22, node 19) besides E5) take extra (node 22, node 19) (E17).\n4.

At node 24 (incident via the cycle to node 23 and node 25 and extra (node 21, node 24)) use extra (node 21, node 24) (E4) to node 21.\n10.

Then at node 15 take extra (E7) from node 15 to node 20.\n16.

At node 16 now the sole remaining incident is the cycle edge (node 16, node 17) (C16). Use (C16) to node 17.\n23. At node 17 use the remaining cycle edge (node 17, node 18) (C17) to node 18.\n24. At node 18 use the cycle edge (node 18, node 19) (C18) to node 19.\n25. At node 19 use the remaining cycle edge (node 19, node 20) (C19) to node 20.\n26.

At node 5 use the cycle edge (node 5, node 6) (C5) to node 6.\n39. At node 6 use the cycle edge (node 6, node 7) (C6) to return to node 7.\n40. At node 7 finally use the remaining cycle edge (node 7, node 8) (C7) to node 8.\n41. At node 8 use the last cycle edge (node 8, node 9) (C8) to node 9.\n42.

List all 16 edges (each used exactly once):\n\n  Edges:\n  • <node 1, node 2>\n  • <node 2, node 3>\n  • <node 3, node 4>\n  • <node 4, node 5>\n  • <node 5, node 6>\n  • <node 6, node 7>\n  • <node 7, node 8>\n  • <node 8, node 9>\n  • <node 9, node 10>\n  • <node 10, node 1>\n  • <node 6, node 9>\n  • <node 2, node 4>\n  • <node 5, node 7>\n  • <node 2, node 6>\n  • <node 1, node 5>\n  • <node 4, node 1>\n\nUsing a “Hierholzer-style” approach starting at “node 7”, one possible trail is:\n\n1. Start at node 7.\n2. Go from node 7 to node 8 (using edge 7–8).\n3. From node 8 go to node 9 (using edge 8–9).\n4. From node 9 go to node 10 (using edge 9–10).\n5. From node 10 go to node 1 (using edge 10–1).\n6. From node 1 go to node 2 (using edge 1–2).\n7. From node 2 go to node 3 (using edge 2–3).\n8. From node 3 go to node 4 (using edge 3–4).\n9.

(A full degree‐check shows that every node except node 6 and node 7 has even degree.)\n\nOne valid Eulerian path (using a Hierholzer “splice‐in” method) is constructed in two stages. In our solution we “force” the trail to start at node 6 and end at node 7. (Any Euler trail is acceptable if it uses every edge exactly once.) For example, one solution is to first “follow” this long trail:\n\n  stage A + C:\n   6 → 3 → 4 → 11 → 3 → 2 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7\n\nIn the course of this route some extra edges are “left over” (those not used in the above “skeleton”)–namely the edges connecting node 2 with 10 and 9 and, on the “other side”, the edges among {7,8,9,10}. (In our list the “unused” edges were <node 2,node 10>, <node 2,node 9>, <node 8,node 10> and <node 7,node 9> as well as the edge <node 7,node 8> that did not appear on the skeleton.) These remaining unused edges form a cycle on the five vertices 2,10,8,7,9. One may “insert” such an Eulerian circuit at the chosen instance of node 2 in the trail. One valid Euler circuit in the “unused subgraph” is\n\n  2 → 10 → 8 → 7 → 9 → 2\n\nSplicing that circuit into the earlier trail at the occurrence of node 2 produces a complete Eulerian path that uses every edge once and goes from node 6 to node 7. (A careful check shows that the 21 edges E1–E21 [see below] are all used exactly once.)\n\nOne acceptable answer is therefore the following node‐sequence:\n\n  6, 3, 4, 11, 3, 2, 10, 8, 7, 9, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7\n\nThe “edge–assignment” is as follows:\n • 6→3 uses edge <node 6, node 3>\n • 3→4 uses edge <node 3, node 4>\n • 4→11 uses edge <node 4, node 11>\n • 11→3 uses edge <node 3, node 11>\n • 3→2 uses edge <node 2, node 3>\n • 2→10 uses edge <node 2, node 10>\n • 10→8 uses edge <node 8, node 10>\n • 8→7 uses edge <node 7, node 8>\n • 7→9 uses edge <node 7, node 9>\n • 9→2 uses edge <node 2, node 9>\n • 2→8 uses edge <node 2, node 8>\n • 8→9 uses edge <node 8, node 9>\n • 9→10 uses edge <node 9, node 10>\n • 10→11 uses edge <node 10, node 11>\n • 11→12 uses edge <node 11, node 12>\n • 12→1 uses edge <node 12, node 1>\n • 1→2 uses edge <node 1, node 2>\n • 2→4 uses edge <node 2, node 4>\n • 4→5 uses edge <node 4, node 5>\n • 5→6 uses edge <node 5, node 6>\n • 6→7 uses edge <node 6, node 7>\n\nThus, one valid Eulerian path on the given board is:\n\nAnswer: node 6, node 3, node 4, node 11, node 3, node 2, node 10, node 8, node 7, node 9, node 2, node 8, node 9, node 10, node 11, node 12, node 1, node 2, node 4, node 5, node 6, node 7"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

(Any Eulerian trail starting at an odd‐degree vertex—in this case node 20—and finishing at the other odd vertex—node 25—is correct.)\n\nTo explain briefly, we first computed the degree of every vertex. The 26 “cycle” edges (from node 1 to node 2, …, node 25 to node 26, and node 26 back to node 1) give every node an initial degree 2. Then, adding the extra 20 edges increases most degrees by an even number, with the exceptions of node 20 and node 25 (each ends with degree 3). Since an Eulerian trail exists in an undirected graph if exactly 0 or 2 vertices have odd degree (with the trail starting and finishing at the odd‐degree vertices), the trail must begin at one odd node and end at the other. In our solution we choose to start at node 20 and finish at node 25.\n\nOne possible Eulerian path (found via reasoning very similar to Hierholzer’s algorithm) is as follows:\n\n start at node 20, then take the extra edge (8,20) to node 8, continue over the cycle (from 8 to 7), then use the extra edge (3,7) to reach node 3, then (3,12) to node 12, then (12,23) to node 23, then the extra edge (23,8) brings you back to node 8, after which you follow (8,9) to node 9. From node 9 go to node 10 by the cycle, then take the extra edge (10,15) to node 15, then (15,22) to node 22, then by the cycle (22,23) to node 23, next (23,24) leads to node 24, and (24,25) brings you to node 25. (At this point the trail re‐enters node 25 but does not finish yet because not all edges have been used.) Continuing from node 25 take (25,26) to node 26, then (26,1) to node 1, then extra edge (1,17) to node 17, then (17,18) via the cycle gives node 18, then extra edge (1,18) takes you back to node 1, next (1,2) to node 2, then extra (2,4) to node 4, then extra (4,17) to node 17, then (17,16) returns you to node 16. From node 16, take extra (6,16) to node 6, then use the extra edge (6,7) (the duplicate edge in addition to the cycle edge) to node 7, then use the cycle edge (7,6) to node 6, followed by (5,6) (via the cycle) to node 5, and then (4,5) to node 4. Next, use the cycle edge (3,4) to get back to node 3 and then (2,3) to node 2. From node 2 take extra (2,14) to node 14. At node 14, use extra (9,14) to node 9, then extra (9,22) to node 22, and from node 22 take (21,22) to node 21. Next, (20,21) brings you back to node 20, then (19,20) to node 19, and from node 19 the extra (10,19) leads to node 10. Now go by (10,11) to node 11, then extra (11,18) to node 18, then by (18,19) from the cycle to node 19, and next extra (11,19) takes you to node 11. From node 11, use the cycle (11,12) to node 12, then (12,13) to node 13, followed by (13,14) to node 14, then (14,15) to node 15, next (15,16) to node 16, and finally the extra edge (16,25) brings you to node 25, which is the required end.\n\nWhen written as a comma‑separated list of nodes, the final Eulerian trail is:\n\nAnswer: node 20, node 8, node 7, node 3, node 12, node 23, node 8, node 9, node 10, node 15, node 22, node 23, node 24, node 25, node 26, node 1, node 17, node 18, node 1, node 2, node 4, node 17, node 16, node 6, node 7, node 6, node 5, node 4, node 3, node 2, node 14, node 9, node 22, node 21, node 20, node 19, node 10, node 11, node 18, node 19, node 11, node 12, node 13, node 14, node 15, node 16, node 25"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

(An “edge‐label” is shown in parentheses for our own bookkeeping; the final answer is simply the sequence of node names.) \n\n• Begin at node 7 (an odd–degree vertex).  \n  – From node 7 take the chord to node 3 (edge E21).  \n• At node 3, then go to node 4 via E3.  \n• From node 4, continue to node 5 by E4.  \n• At node 5, go to node 6 (E5).  \n• At node 6, continue to node 1 using edge E19.  \n• At node 1, go to node 8 using edge E25.  \n• At node 8, head to node 9 by E8.  \n• From node 9, proceed to node 10 by E9.  \n• At node 10, continue to node 11 (E10).  \n• From node 11 go to node 12 (E11).  \n• At node 12 head to node 13 by E12.  \n• From node 13, go to node 14 using E13.  \n• At node 14, move to node 15 via E14.  \n• From node 15, go to node 16 (E15).  \n• At node 16, return to node 1 using edge E16.  \n• At node 1, go to node 2 by E1.  \n• At node 2, continue to node 3 via E2.  \n• At node 3, take the chord to node 12 via E17.  \n• From node 12, go to node 15 with E28.  \n• At node 15, move to node 2 (using edge E20 from 2–15).  \n• From node 2, go to node 6 by E27.  \n• At node 6, return to node 7 via E6.  \n• Now back at node 7, take the chord to node 5 using E18 (remember that edge connects node 5 and node 7).  \n• At node 5, go to node 8 using E22.  \n• From node 8, return to node 7 using the only remaining edge E7 (which connects node 7 and node 8).  \n• At node 7, take the chord to node 13 by E24.  \n• At node 13, go to node 16 along the chord E26.  \n• Finally, at node 16, finish the trail by moving to node 10 (using edge E23).  \n\nThis sequence uses every edge exactly once and starts at node 7 and finishes at node 10.

(A quick check shows that exactly two nodes have odd degree – here node 12 and node 14 – so an Euler trail exists beginning at one odd vertex and ending at the other.) One acceptable answer begins at node 12 and ends at node 14; one valid Eulerian path is produced by “splicing together” a trail P that uses 15 of the extra edges and then inserting an Euler “cycle” C in the remaining 27 edges (the 24 cycle–edges plus the 3 extra edges that were not used in P). (For example, one may take as P the trail\n  12 → 23 (via extra 12–23),\n  23 → 18 (via extra 23–18),\n  18 → 16 (via extra 16–18),\n  16 → 4 (via extra 4–16),\n  4 → 6 (via extra 4–6),\n  6 → 2 (via extra 6–2),\n  2 → 15 (via extra 2–15),\n  15 → 3 (via extra 3–15),\n  3 → 20 (via extra 20–3),\n  20 → 22 (via extra 20–22),\n  22 → 11 (via extra 22–11),\n  11 → 1 (via extra 1–11),\n  1 → 21 (via extra 1–21),\n  21 → 10 (via extra 10–21), and\n  10 → 14 (via extra 10–14).)\n\nThen one may “insert” into the vertex 14 the Euler cycle C in the unused edges of U (namely, the 24 cycle–edges plus the three extra edges 9–12, 8–12, and the second copy 9–8). One acceptable Eulerian cycle in U that starts and ends at 14 is\n\n  14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, \n  – take extra 8–12 → 12, then extra 9–12 backwards → 9, then extra 9–8 → 8,\n  then resume the cycle with 8–9, 9–10, 10–11, 11–12, 12–13, 13–14.\n\nSplicing P and C produces the following Euler trail through all 42 edges:\n\n  node 12, node 23, node 18, node 16, node 4, node 6, node 2, node 15, node 3, node 20, node 22, node 11, node 1, node 21, node 10, node 14,\n  node 15, node 16, node 17, node 18, node 19, node 20, node 21, node 22, node 23, node 24, node 1, node 2, node 3, node 4, node 5, node 6, node 7, node 8, node 12, node 9, node 8, node 9, node 10, node 11, node 12, node 13, node 14.\n\nAny answer that is a permutation of the nodes in a comma‐separated list (and uses each edge exactly once) is acceptable.\n\nAnswer: node 12, node 23, node 18, node 16, node 4, node 6, node 2, node 15, node 3, node 20, node 22, node 11, node 1, node 21, node 10, node 14, node 15, node 16, node 17, node 18, node 19, node 20, node 21, node 22, node 23, node 24, node 1, node 2, node 3, node 4, node 5, node 6, node 7, node 8, node 12, node 9, node 8, node 9, node 10, node 11, node 12, node 13, node 14"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

(Recall that an undirected graph has an Eulerian trail if and only if it is connected and exactly two vertices have odd degree. In our graph the only odd‐degree vertices turn out to be “node 5” and “node 17” so any Euler trail must start in one of these and end in the other.) \n\nOne way to “find” an Eulerian trail is to “peel it off” by “walking” along unused edges and (when a “dead end” is reached) splicing in any “unused cycle” that must have been left aside. One acceptable answer is as follows. (Any answer that is, as a list of nodes, a trail that uses every edge exactly once is correct.) \n\nHere is one valid Eulerian path. We start at node 5 (one odd‐vertex) and “force” our way through the “main cycle” and extra chords. At one point, when we are at node 4, a “subcycle” remains (using the still‐unused cycle edges from node 4 via node 3, node 2, node 1, node 22, node 21, node 9 and back to node 4). We may “splice” that loop into our overall circuit and then resume. (In our notation the extra edges are marked with letters; they are all used exactly once.) \n\nThe trail below goes (with our “extra” naming in parentheses):\n1. Start at node 5  \n2. 5 → 19      (using extra edge <5,19>)  \n3. 19 → 20      (cycle edge)  \n4. 20 → 4      (extra edge <4,20>)  \n5. 4 → 22      (extra edge <4,22>)  \n6. 22 → 14      (extra edge <14,22>)  \n7. 14 → 20      (extra edge <14,20>)  \n8. 20 → 21      (cycle edge)  \n9. 21 → 6      (extra edge <21,6>)  \n10. 6 → 7      (cycle edge)  \n11. 7 → 8      (cycle edge)  \n12. 8 → 9      (cycle edge)  \n13. 9 → 3      (extra edge <3,9>)  \n14. 3 → 18      (extra edge <18,3>)  \n15. 18 → 13      (extra edge <13,18>)  \n16. 13 → 10      (extra edge <10,13>)  \n17. 10 → 16      (extra edge <10,16>)  \n18. 16 → 15      (cycle edge)  \n19. 15 → 14      (cycle edge)  \n20. 14 → 13      (cycle edge)  \n21. 13 → 12      (cycle edge)  \n22. 12 → 11      (cycle edge)  \n23. 11 → 10      (cycle edge)  \n24. 10 → 9      (cycle edge)  \n25. 9 → 4      (extra edge <9,4>)  \n  Now at node 4 a “side‐cycle” remains. We “splice” it in as follows:\n26. 4 → 3      (cycle edge <3,4>)  \n27. 3 → 2      (cycle edge <2,3>)  \n28. 2 → 1      (cycle edge <1,2>)  \n29. 1 → 22      (cycle edge <22,1>)  \n30. 22 → 21      (cycle edge <21,22>)  \n31. 21 → 9      (extra edge <9,21>)  \n32. 9 → 4      (extra edge <4,9>)  \n  Having come back to node 4 we resume the main trail:\n33. 4 → 5      (cycle edge <4,5>)  \n34. 5 → 6      (cycle edge <5,6>)  \n35. 6 → 17      (extra edge <6,17>)  \n36. 17 → 16      (cycle edge <16,17>)  \n37. 16 → 19      (extra edge <16,19>)  \n38. 19 → 18      (cycle edge <18,19>)  \n39. 18 → 17      (cycle edge <17,18>)  \nNow we finish at node 17 (the other odd‐vertex).

In the solution below we choose to start at node 3 and finish at node 4.\n\nOne valid Eulerian path (i.e. a trail that traverses every edge exactly once) is as follows. (In the following, we “remove” an edge as it is used so that it is not repeated.)\n\n1. Start at node 3. (From node 3 the edges available are {3,7}, {3,4}, and {2,3}.

We have 18 nodes and 29 undirected edges. (For example, there is a “cycle‐edge” cycle going through 1–2–3–…–18–1 plus extra “chord‐edges”.) When we count the incident edges (remembering each undirected edge contributes 1 to the “degree” of both endpoints), we find that every vertex has even degree except for node 6 and node 16 (each with degree 3). (You can check that, for example, node 6 is incident to the edges 5–6, 6–7, and 6–16; similarly, node 16 is incident to 15–16, 16–17, and 6–16.) Since exactly two nodes have odd degree, an Eulerian trail exists starting at one odd vertex and ending at the other.\n\nI choose to start at node 6 and end at node 16.

(Along the way I refer to each edge by its “id” as listed below; these ids are only for tracking purposes.)\n\nThe given edges are:\n1. 1–2  \n2. 2–3  \n3. 3–4  \n4. 4–5  \n5. 5–6  \n6. 6–7  \n7. 7–8  \n8. 8–9  \n9. 9–10  \n10. 10–11  \n11. 11–12  \n12. 12–13  \n13. 13–14  \n14. 14–15  \n15. 15–16  \n16. 16–17  \n17. 17–18  \n18. 18–1  \n19. 9–18  \n20. 12–18  \n21. 5–15  \n22. 2–9  \n23. 6–16  \n24. 7–15  \n25. 1–8  \n26. 2–7  \n27. 12–17  \n28. 1–17  \n29. 8–5\n\nOne Eulerian trail found by “Hierholzer’s algorithm” is:\n\nStep 1. Start at the odd vertex node 6.  \n  Traverse 6 → 7 using edge 6 (6–7).  \nStep 2. At node 7, go 7 → 2 using edge 26 (2–7).  \nStep 3. At node 2, go 2 → 3 using edge 2 (2–3).  \nStep 4. At node 3, go 3 → 4 using edge 3 (3–4).  \nStep 5. At node 4, go 4 → 5 using edge 4 (4–5).  \nStep 6. At node 5, go 5 → 15 using edge 21 (5–15).  \nStep 7. At node 15, go 15 → 7 using edge 24 (7–15).  \nStep 8. At node 7 (again), go 7 → 8 using edge 7 (7–8).  \nStep 9. At node 8, go 8 → 1 using edge 25 (1–8).  \nStep 10. At node 1, go 1 → 17 using edge 28 (1–17).  \nStep 11. At node 17, go 17 → 18 using edge 17 (17–18).  \nStep 12. At node 18, go 18 → 9 using edge 19 (9–18).  \nStep 13. At node 9, go 9 → 10 using edge 9 (9–10).  \nStep 14. At node 10, go 10 → 11 using edge 10 (10–11).  \nStep 15. At node 11, go 11 → 12 using edge 11 (11–12).  \nStep 16. At node 12, go 12 → 13 using edge 12 (12–13).  \nStep 17. At node 13, go 13 → 14 using edge 13 (13–14).  \nStep 18. At node 14, go 14 → 15 using edge 14 (14–15).  \nStep 19. At node 15 (again), go 15 → 16 using edge 15 (15–16).  \n  Now we are at node 16 but still have unused edges adjacent to already visited nodes.  \nStep 20. From node 16, leave by going 16 → 6 using edge 23 (6–16).  \nStep 21. At node 6 now, go 6 → 5 using edge 5 (5–6).  \nStep 22. At node 5 (again), go 5 → 8 using edge 29 (8–5).  \nStep 23. At node 8, go 8 → 9 using edge 8 (8–9).  \nStep 24. At node 9 (again), go 9 → 2 using edge 22 (2–9).  \nStep 25. At node 2, go 2 → 1 using edge 1 (1–2).  \nStep 26. At node 1 (again), go 1 → 18 using edge 18 (18–1).  \nStep 27. At node 18 (again), go 18 → 12 using edge 20 (12–18).  \nStep 28. At node 12 (again), go 12 → 17 using edge 27 (12–17).  \nStep 29. Finally, at node 17, return 17 → 16 using edge 16 (16–17).  \n\nThis completes a trail that uses every edge exactly once. The trail starts at node 6 (one odd vertex) and ends at node 16 (the other odd vertex).\n\nThe full Eulerian path is:\n\n6, 7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15, 7, 8, 1, 17, 18, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 6, 5, 8, 9, 2, 1, 18, 12, 17, 16\n\nAnswer: node 6, node 7, node 2, node 3, node 4, node 5, node 15, node 7, node 8, node 1, node 17, node 18, node 9, node 10, node 11, node 12, node 13, node 14, node 15, node 16, node 6, node 5, node 8, node 9, node 2, node 1, node 18, node 12, node 17, node 16"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In our graph the only two odd‐degree nodes turn out to be “node 8” (degree 3) and “node 10” (degree 3). (All the other nodes appear with even degree.)  \n   \nAn Eulerian trail in an undirected graph must start at one odd vertex and end at the other. In our solution below we choose to begin at “node 8” and finish at “node 10.” (Any answer that “rotates” this Euler trail or reverses it is valid.)  \n   \nThere are several “cycles” (or “detours”) in the graph. For example, note that “node 6” is incident to three edges: one edge going to “node 5” and two distinct edges between “node 6” and “node 7” (the edge (6,7) appears twice). To use both copies exactly once, we need to “detour” via node 7 immediately and return to “node 6” before continuing on. Similarly, notice that “node 1” is incident to four edges including two copies of an edge connecting “node 1” and “node 21.” (That is, the edge (node 21, node 1) appears twice.) We arrange the path so that upon arriving at “node 1” we take the cycle through “node 21” and then return to “node 1” before leaving.  \n   \nOne correct Eulerian path that traverses every edge exactly once is as follows.
