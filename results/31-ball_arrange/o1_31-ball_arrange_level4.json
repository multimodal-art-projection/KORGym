This aligns with the rule that the moved ball must match the top color of the target tube (or the tube must be empty).\n\nAnswer: BD","A good next move is to place the top ball from tube B (which is color 2) onto tube D, because the top ball in D is also color 2. This consolidates three of the “2” balls in tube D, moving us closer to having a full tube of the same color.\n\nAnswer: BD","A valid move here is to take the top ball from tube D (color 2) and place it onto tube B, whose top ball is also color 2 (and which has space). This satisfies the rule that you may only stack a ball onto another of the same color (or into an entirely empty tube).\n\nAnswer: DB","A valid move under the rules is to take the top ball from tube B (which is color 2) and place it on tube D, whose top ball is also color 2 (and D has space).

Thus, “DB” is the correct move notation.\n\nAnswer: DB","A valid move must place a ball onto a tube that has either the same color on top or is completely empty. In the given configuration, the only tube with space (an empty top slot) is D, and the top colors on B and D both happen to be 2. Therefore, you can move the top ball (color 2) from tube B onto tube D.\n\nAnswer: BD","A valid next move under the rules is to take the top ball (color 2) from tube D and place it on tube B (whose top ball is also color 2). This is the only legal move available because:\n\n• Tubes C, E, and F are already full (4 balls), so you cannot place another ball on them.  \n• Tube D is also full, so you cannot place a ball onto D.  \n• Tubes A, G, and H do not have matching top colors for any other tube’s top ball (and none are completely empty), so no moves to those tubes are possible.  \n• Between B (top color 2) and D (top color 2), you can move the top ball from D to B because B still has space for one more ball and the colors match.\n\nAnswer: DB","BD\n\nAnswer: BD","A valid move here is to take the top ball (color 2) from Tube D and place it on top of Tube B, since Tube B’s top ball is also color 2 and there is space available.  \n\nAnswer: DB","A possible valid next move is to take the top ball (which is color 2) from tube B and place it onto tube A. Tube A is effectively empty at the top (since its three upper slots are zeros), so it can accept any color ball. This move frees up space in tube B for future sorting steps.\n\nAnswer: BA","One valid move is to take the top ball (color 2) from tube B and place it onto tube D, which has an empty top slot.
