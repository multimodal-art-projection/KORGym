For example, 'Answer: DC' means moving the top ball from tube D onto the top of tube C.\nLevel: 3    Epoch: 35 \nNote: Each tube is displayed in the format [bottom, ..., top].\nA: [5, 5, 5, 5]\nB: [0, 0, 0, 0]\nC: [1, 1, 1, 1]\nD: [0, 0, 0, 0]\nE: [2, 2, 2, 2]\nF: [4, 4, 4, 4]\nG: [3, 3, 3, 3]\n","action":"DC","score":1,"response":["I need to analyze the state of the tubes and determine the best move to help sort the colored balls so that three tubes each contain exactly four balls of the same color.\n\nLooking at the current state:\n- A: [5, 2, 4, 5] - Has two 5s but they're not together\n- B: [1, 5, 5, 4] - Has two 5s grouped together\n- C: [1, 4, 1, 3] - Has two 1s but they're not together\n- D: [3, 1, 4, 2] - Mixed colors\n- E: [2, 2, 3, 3] - Has pairs of 2s and 3s grouped together\n- F: [0, 0, 0, 0] - Empty tube\n- G: [0, 0, 0, 0] - Empty tube\n\nI notice there are multiple color 5s between tubes A and B.

If I move the 4 from D to C, I'll have three 4's in tube C.\n\nAlso, I see tube A has three 2's and tube D has one 2. Moving the 2 from D to A would leave a tube with just one 4.\n\nMy goal is to create tubes with matching colors, so the best move is to move the 2 from tube D to tube A, which would give me a tube with four 2's.\n\nThe move would be from tube D to tube A (DA).\n\nAnswer: DA","I'll analyze this game board and find the best move to make progress towards having three tubes with four balls of the same color each.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Tube A: [2, 3, 2, 2] - Mostly color 2 (three balls), with one color 3 ball\n- Tube B: [4, 5, 5, 0] - Two color 5 balls on top, one color 4 ball, one empty space\n- Tube C: [4, 4, 0, 0] - Two color 4 balls, two empty spaces\n- Tube D: [4, 2, 0, 0] - One color 2 ball on top, one color 4 ball, two empty spaces\n- Tube E: [5, 3, 3, 5] - Color 5 on top, two color 3 balls in the middle, one color 5 at the bottom\n- Tube F: [1, 1, 1, 1] - Already complete with four color 1 balls\n- Tube G: [3, 0, 0, 0] - One color 3 ball, three empty spaces\n\nI notice tube F is already complete with four color 1 balls.

Looking at tube C, we have two color 4 balls, and there's another color 4 ball in tube D at the bottom, but we can't access it directly. There's also a color 4 ball at the bottom of tube B.\n\nLet's move the color 2 ball from tube D to tube A, where we already have three color 2 balls. This will bring us closer to having a second complete tube.\n\nAnswer: DA","Looking at the game board, I need to strategically move balls to create three tubes with four balls of the same color each.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Tube A: [2, 3, 2, 2] - Has three '2's but mixed with a '3'\n- Tube B: [4, 5, 5, 0] - Has two '5's and one '4' with an empty space\n- Tube C: [4, 4, 0, 0] - Has two '4's and two empty spaces\n- Tube D: [4, 2, 0, 0] - Has one '4', one '2', and two empty spaces\n- Tube E: [5, 3, 3, 5] - Mixed with two '3's and two '5's\n- Tube F: [1, 1, 1, 1] - Already complete with four '1's\n- Tube G: [3, 0, 0, 0] - Has one '3' and three empty spaces\n\nI notice that tube F is already complete with four '1's. Looking for the best move:\n\nThe most promising move is to move the top ball from tube D (a '2') onto tube A, where the top ball is also a '2'. This will give me four '2's in tube A, creating a second completed tube.\n\nAfter this move, tube A would be [2, 3, 2, 2, 2] which isn't valid as tubes can only hold 4 balls. So let me reconsider...\n\nTube D has a '2' on top, and tube A has a '2' on top. Moving from D to A would make tube A have [2, 3, 2, 2, 2], which isn't possible. So I need to move the '2' from tube A somewhere else first.\n\nMy analysis was incorrect. Let me review the tubes again:\n- Tube A has a '2' on top\n- Tube D has nothing on top (the top ball is a '2' but it's in position 2, with positions 3 and 4 being empty)\n\nThe correct interpretation is:\n- Tube A: [2, 3, 2, 2] - Top ball is '2'\n- Tube D: [4, 2, 0, 0] - Top ball is '2'\n\nSo I want to move the '2' from tube D to tube A, which would result in:\n- Tube A: [2, 3, 2, 2, 2] - This would be invalid\n- Tube D: [4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSince that doesn't work, let me reconsider. I notice we can work toward completing the '4's by moving the top ball from tube D (which is '2') to an empty space, then moving tube C's '4's to tube D.\n\nSo the best move is to move the '2' from tube D to the empty space in tube G, allowing us to later consolidate the '4's.\n\nAnswer: DG","I need to analyze this game board and find a move that helps arrange the tubes so that three of them contain exactly four balls of the same color.\n\nLet's analyze the current state:\n- Tube A: [2, 3, 2, 2] - Mixed colors, with 2 at the top\n- Tube B: [4, 5, 5, 0] - Mixed colors, with 5 at the top and one empty space\n- Tube C: [4, 4, 0, 0] - Two color 4 balls, two empty spaces\n- Tube D: [4, 2, 0, 0] - Mixed colors, with 2 at the top and two empty spaces\n- Tube E: [5, 3, 3, 5] - Mixed colors, with 5 at the top\n- Tube F: [1, 1, 1, 1] - Already complete with four color 1 balls\n- Tube G: [3, 0, 0, 0] - One color 3 ball, three empty spaces\n\nTube F is already perfect with four 1's. \n\nLooking at the other tubes, I notice:\n- We have three balls of color 4 spread across tubes B, C, and D\n- We have three balls of color 2 in tubes A and D\n- We have four balls of color 3 in tubes A, E, and G\n- We have three balls of color 5 in tubes B and E\n\nLooking at the top balls and possible moves:\n- D has a 2 at the top, which could move to A (which has a 2 at the top)\n- E has a 5 at the top, which could move to B (which has a 5 at the top)\n\nMoving the 2 from tube D to tube A would consolidate more color 2 balls together.

For example, 'Answer: DC' means moving the top ball from tube D onto the top of tube C.\nLevel: 4    Epoch: 74 \nNote: Each tube is displayed in the format [bottom, ..., top].\nA: [0, 0, 0, 0]\nB: [6, 6, 6, 6]\nC: [4, 4, 4, 4]\nD: [5, 5, 5, 5]\nE: [2, 2, 2, 2]\nF: [0, 0, 0, 0]\nG: [1, 1, 1, 1]\nH: [3, 3, 3, 3]\n","action":"FB","score":1,"response":["I need to move balls between tubes so that three tubes have four balls of the same color, making sure to follow the rule that I can only move balls to empty tubes or onto matching colors.\n\nLooking at the current state:\n- Tube A has [4, 5, 6, 1] - mixed colors with 1 on top\n- Tube B has [6, 3, 1, 3] - mixed colors with 3 on top\n- Tube C has [2, 2, 1, 1] - has two 2s at bottom, two 1s at top\n- Tube D has [4, 3, 3, 4] - mixed with 4 on top\n- Tube E has [2, 2, 5, 5] - has two 2s at bottom, two 5s at top\n- Tube F has [6, 6, 5, 4] - has two 6s at bottom, 5 and 4 on top\n- Tubes G and H are empty\n\nI'm looking to create tubes of identical colors.

Let's see what we have:\n\nTube A: Already has 4 balls of color 4 - this is a completed tube\nTube D: Already has 4 balls of color 1 - this is a completed tube\nTube G: Already has 4 balls of color 5 - this is a completed tube\n\nSo we already have 3 completed tubes (A, D, and G). The game is asking to have three tubes with exactly four balls of the same color, and we already have that. However, I should still make a valid move as requested.\n\nLooking at the remaining tubes:\n- Tube B has [2, 3, 6, 0] with a color 6 on top\n- Tube C has [3, 0, 0, 0] with a color 3 on top\n- Tube E has [3, 6, 6, 6] with a color 6 on top\n- Tube F has [3, 0, 0, 0] with a color 3 on top\n- Tube H has [2, 2, 2, 0] with a color 2 on top\n\nI notice that tube H has three balls of color 2, and tube B has a ball of color 2 at the bottom. If we could eventually get all color 2 balls together, that would be ideal.\n\nAlso, tubes C and F both have a single ball of color 3, and tube B has a ball of color 3 as well.\n\nA good move would be to move a color 6 ball from B to E, since E already has three color 6 balls.\n\nAnswer: BE","Looking at the game board, I need to move balls to create three tubes with four balls of the same color.\n\nLet me analyze the current state:\n- Tube A already has 4 balls of color 4\n- Tube D already has 4 balls of color 1\n- Tube G already has 4 balls of color 5\n- Tube H has 3 balls of color 2 and needs one more to be complete\n- Tube B has one ball of color 2 at the bottom\n- Tube E has 3 balls of color 6 at the top\n- Tubes C and F each have one ball of color 3\n\nI notice that tube B has a ball of color 2 that can be moved to tube H to complete a tube of all color 2 balls. Since tube B has color 2 at the bottom and 6 at the top, I need to first move the 6 and 3 from tube B.\n\nHowever, looking more carefully, I see that tube B has [2, 3, 6, 0] and tube H has [2, 2, 2, 0]. The top ball in tube B is actually empty (0), and the top non-empty ball is 6. The top ball in tube H is 2.\n\nI need to move the ball of color 2 from tube B to tube H, but that's not possible directly since it's at the bottom of tube B. This means I need a different approach.\n\nActually, I see now that tube A already has 4 balls of color 4, tube D already has 4 balls of color 1, and tube G already has 4 balls of color 5. That's already three tubes with exactly four balls of the same color, which meets the winning condition. The game may be asking for a move to create an additional tube of four same-colored balls.\n\nSince I'm asked to provide a move, and moving from tube B to tube H would help create a fourth tube of the same color, I'll suggest moving the top ball from tube B (which is currently empty) to tube H.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me reconsider...\n\nSince tube H has three balls of color 2 and needs one more to be complete, and tube B has a ball of color 2, ideally we would move that 2 to tube H. But we can't move it directly since it's at the bottom of tube B.\n\nI believe I need to choose a valid move between any two tubes. Looking at the constraints, I can only move the top ball of a tube to another tube where either:\n1. The target tube is empty, or\n2. The target tube's top ball matches the color of the ball being moved\n\nValid moves I can make:\n- Move the top ball (6) from tube B to tube E, since E's top ball is also 6\n- Move a ball (3) from tube C or F to the other, since they both have 3 at the top\n\nI'll choose to move the 6 from tube B to tube E.\n\nAnswer: BE","I need to analyze the game board and find a move that helps me sort the balls so that three tubes each contain exactly four balls of the same color.\n\nLet me check the current state:\n- Tube A already has four 4's\n- Tube D already has four 1's\n- Tube G already has four 5's\n- Tube H has three 2's and needs one more\n- Tube B has a 2 at the bottom which could be moved to H\n- Tubes C and F each have a single 3\n- Tube E has a 3 at the bottom and three 6's on top\n\nSince three tubes (A, D, and G) are already completed with four balls of the same color, I don't need to create more completed tubes. I just need to make sure not to disturb these tubes.\n\nLooking at the state, the best move is to move the top ball from tube B (which is a 6) to tube E, since tube E already has 6's at the top.

This would then expose the color 2 ball in tube B.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to move the top ball from tube B to tube E.\n\nAnswer: BE","Looking at the game board, I need to move balls to create three tubes with four balls of the same color.\n\nI notice that tubes A, D, and G already contain four balls of the same color (tube A has four 4's, tube D has four 1's, and tube G has four 5's).\n\nI need to examine the remaining tubes to see if we can create more complete sets:\n- Tube B: [2, 3, 6, 0] - contains mixed colors with one empty space\n- Tube C: [3, 0, 0, 0] - contains one 3 and three empty spaces\n- Tube E: [3, 6, 6, 6] - contains three 6's and one 3\n- Tube F: [3, 0, 0, 0] - contains one 3 and three empty spaces\n- Tube H: [2, 2, 2, 0] - contains three 2's and one empty space\n\nI notice that tube B has a 6 at the top and tube E has three 6's with a 3 at the bottom.
