If you move the top ball from tube B (which is a 3) into an empty tube (say, tube D), tube B will then reveal a 1 on top. This will help later to consolidate the four 1’s together, since one of the target homogeneous tubes should eventually be all 1’s. \n\nThe move is valid because the destination tube D is empty, which conforms to the rule that the ball being moved must either match the color at the top of the target tube or the tube must be empty.\n\nThus, the move is from Tube B to Tube D.\n\nAnswer: BD","I analyzed the board and noticed that tube C’s top ball is a 3 and tube D’s only ball is also a 3. Since the rule allows moving a ball onto a tube whose top ball is of the same color (and tube D is far from full), moving the top ball of tube C onto tube D is a legal move. This step groups same‐colored 3’s together, which is a promising move toward eventually getting three tubes filled with four balls of one color each.\n\nAnswer: CD","I'll analyze the board. We have five tubes:\n\n A: [3, 3, 2, 1] (full)\n B: [2, 1, 1, 0] (three balls: 2, 1, 1)\n C: [2, 2, 1, 0] (three balls: 2, 2, 1)\n D: [3, 3, 0, 0] (two balls: 3, 3)\n E: [0, 0, 0, 0] (empty)\n\nNotice the total colors: the ones add up to 4 (one “1” in A, two in B, one in C), the twos add up to 4 (one in A, one in B, two in C), and the threes add up to 4 (two in A, two in D). Our goal is to have three tubes, each filled (four balls) and homogeneous in color.\n\nOne promising strategy is to start “unlocking” a tube so that later we can collect a complete set. In tube A the top (movable) ball is a 1; however, A’s underlying 3’s are what we want to gather with D’s two 3’s. So we need to remove the top ball from A without “polluting” any tube that is already on track to complete a color.\n\nTube E is completely empty, which makes it an ideal temporary destination. Thus, moving the top ball (a 1) from tube A into tube E is a legal move (because the destination is empty) and it clears tube A so that eventually the buried 3’s could be accessed and later moved onto tube D (which already has two 3’s).\n\nFollowing this reasoning, the best move is to take the top ball from tube A and place it onto tube E. That move is represented by the letters “AE.”\n\nAnswer: AE","I'll analyze the board first. The tubes are:\n\n A: [3, 3, 2, 0] → contains balls: 3 (bottom), 3, 2 (top)\n B: [2, 1, 1, 0] → contains balls: 2, 1, 1 (top)\n C: [2, 2, 1, 0] → contains balls: 2, 2, 1 (top)\n D: [3, 3, 0, 0] → contains balls: 3, 3 (top)\n E: [1, 0, 0, 0] → contains ball: 1 (top)\n\nOur goal is to ultimately have three tubes full (four balls each) of one color (each tube uniform). Notice that in tube C the bottom two balls are both 2’s, and the only interfering ball is the top ball 1. In the rules a move consists of taking the top ball of one tube and placing it on top of another tube provided that either the destination is empty or its top ball is the same color as the moved ball.\n\nIn tube C, the top ball is 1. We see that tube E’s top (and only) ball is also 1. So moving the top ball from tube C to tube E is valid. After doing that, tube C becomes [2, 2, 0, 0] (revealing only 2’s, which sets it well on the way toward being finished as a uniform tube of 2’s) and tube E becomes [1, 1, 0, 0]. This move progresses the solve since one tube (C) becomes homogeneous, and it also helps free up moves later.\n\nThus, the two‐letter move indicating “move the top ball from tube C onto tube E” is:\n\nAnswer: CE","We can start by “unlocking” a good sequence. One promising first move is to clear tube A’s “blocking” ball so that its top becomes a 3. To do that, take the top ball of tube A (which is a 2) and put it on a tube whose top is also 2. Looking at the board, Tube C’s top ball is 2, so moving from tube A to tube C is legal. (Recall that each tube’s representation is [bottom, …, top] and a 0 means an empty slot.) \n\nAfter that move the tubes become:\n • A: [3, 3, 0, 0]  (the top 2 is removed)\n • C: [2, 2, 2, 0]  (added the 2 on top of the two 2’s already there)\n • B, D, and E remain unchanged.\n\nThis move sets up things nicely so that later you can build a complete tube of 3’s (using the now accessible top ball 3 in tube A and the 3’s in tube D) and similarly combine the other colors to eventually have three tubes of four same-colored balls.\n\nAnswer: AC","I'll start by considering our board. We have five tubes:\n\n A: [3, 3, 0, 0]   \n B: [2, 1, 1, 0]   \n C: [2, 2, 2, 0]   \n D: [3, 3, 0, 0]   \n E: [1, 1, 0, 0]   \n\nOur goal is to finish three tubes with four balls of the same color. Notice that colors 1, 2, and 3 each appear exactly four times. In particular, tubes A and D already hold two balls of color 3 each. \n\nA very natural idea is to join the same‐colored balls. For example, if we move the top ball of tube D (which is a 3) onto tube A, then tube A (currently [3, 3, 0, 0]) will receive a 3 on its top (since its current top is 3), and the rule “the ball being moved must either match the color of the ball at the top of the target tube or the target tube must be empty” is satisfied. \n\nAfter that move:\n Tube A becomes: [3, 3, 3, 0] (three 3’s)  \n Tube D becomes: [3, 0, 0, 0] (one 3 remaining)   \n\nThis move is a step toward eventually having a fully completed tube of color 3. (Later, one could move the remaining 3 from tube D onto tube A to complete it.) \n\nThus, the chosen move is from tube D to tube A.\n\nAnswer: DA","I examined the board and noticed that tube A already has three balls of color 3 (A: [3, 3, 3, 0]). Tube D contains a single ball of color 3 (D: [3, 0, 0, 0]). Since the rules allow you to move a ball onto another tube if the color of the ball you're moving matches the color on the target tube’s top (or if it’s empty), the perfect move is to take the top ball from tube D (which is 3) and pour it into tube A. That move results in tube A containing four balls of color 3 ([3, 3, 3, 3]), which meets part of the goal to have three tubes with four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: DA","We can win the level by completing three tubes with four balls each that are all the same color. Notice that tube A already is “solved” with four 3’s. Our next targets are the 2’s in tube C ([2,2,2,0]) and the 1’s – currently appearing in tubes B ([2,1,1,0]) and E ([1,1,0,0]). One good strategy is to use tube E as the “gather‐place” for the 1’s and clear tube B so that its bottom 2 can be used to complete tube C. For example, we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. In tube B the top ball is a 1; tube E already shows a 1 on top (its last nonzero ball is 1). So we can move the top ball from B to E. After that move:\n  • Tube B becomes [2,1,0,0] (its top ball is now 1).\n  • Tube E becomes [1,1,1,0] (three 1’s).\n2. Again, tube B’s top ball is still a 1. Notice that tube E now has three 1’s so adding one more will complete it. Thus, move the next top ball from B to E. Now:\n  • Tube B becomes [2,0,0,0] (its only remaining ball is 2).\n  • Tube E becomes [1,1,1,1] (four 1’s, so it’s solved).\n3. Now tube C contains three 2’s and still needs one more 2 to complete it, and tube B’s top (and only) ball is a 2. Since the top ball of tube C is a 2, we can move the ball from tube B to tube C. This results in:\n  • Tube B becoming empty.\n  • Tube C becoming [2,2,2,2] (four 2’s, so it’s solved).\n\nNow the three completed tubes are A (with four 3’s), E (with four 1’s), and C (with four 2’s). We reached the goal.\n\nThus the moves in order (using two‐letter codes where the first letter is the source and the second is the destination) are:\n\n  Move 1: BE  \n  Move 2: BE  \n  Move 3: BC\n\nAnswer: BE BE BC","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube B onto tube E. Here’s the reasoning:\n\n• Tube A is already finished with four 3’s.\n• Tube C has three 2’s and can later be completed by adding a 2.\n• To complete a tube of 1’s (since there are four 1’s in total across tubes B and E), we need to get the 1’s together.\n• Currently, tube B is [2, 1, 1, 0] (with the top ball being 1) and tube E is [1, 1, 0, 0] (top ball is 1). \n• Because the ball to be moved (1) matches the top ball already present in tube E, moving the ball from B to E is legal and sets up future moves to solve the puzzle.\n\nThus, the move is indicated by “BE” – moving the top ball from tube B onto tube E.\n\nAnswer: BE","The board already shows tube A completely filled with 3’s. Our target is to have three tubes with four balls of the same color. Notice that tube E (which has three 1’s) is just one ball away from being complete for color 1 and tube C (which has three 2’s) is one move away from being completed with 2’s—but the only issue is that in tube B the top ball is a 1, blocking the 2 that is below it. If we first clear that blockage by moving the 1 onto tube E (whose current top ball is 1), then tube E becomes [1,1,1,1] (complete). That move is represented as “BE” (move from tube B to E). After that, tube B will then have its remaining ball, which is a 2, available to move onto tube C (which already holds three 2’s) by a move “BC”. In two moves we would have tubes A, E and C with four balls of the same color.\n\nSince the instructions ask for a response using two letters (to indicate one move) and our first move is “BE”, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: BE","The optimal move is to transfer the top ball from tube B to tube C. Tube B's top ball is a 2 and tube C’s top ball is also a 2, fulfilling the rule that either the target tube is empty or the ball on top matches the moving ball.

Notice that the only tubes with free space are D and E (all other tubes are full). We must move a ball from the top of one full tube to one of the empty tubes. For example, if we take the top ball from tube A it is 2. Tube D is empty so moving the top ball 2 from A into D is a legal move. This move is valid because the target is empty, and it starts the process of freeing tube A so that its “1” (at the third position) and “3” balls can eventually be rearranged into a homogeneous tube. \n\nThus, one correct answer is to move the top ball from tube A to tube D.\n\nAnswer: AD","We first check the board. The tubes (using “bottom … top” order with 0 meaning an empty slot) are currently:\n\n • A: [3, 3, 1, 0] → balls: 3, 3, 1 (top ball is 1)\n • B: [2, 2, 3, 1] → balls: 2, 2, 3, 1 (top ball is 1)\n • C: [2, 3, 1, 1] → balls: 2, 3, 1, 1 (top ball is 1)\n • D: [2, 0, 0, 0] → ball: 2 \n • E: [0, 0, 0, 0] → (empty)\n\nThere are four balls of each color overall (color1, color2, and color3). These are to be regrouped so that three tubes eventually become “pure” – each filled with four balls of one color.\n\nOne common strategy is to free up the tubes that nearly block the “build‐up” of one color. Here notice that both tubes B and C are full; each has a top ball 1, but in each tube the lower parts contain non‐1’s that will need to be exposed in order to form a pure tube of a different color. In particular, by removing the top ball from tube B, you begin the process of clearing tube B (which already holds two twos at its bottom) for assembling the color2 group. \n\nSince the moved ball (a 1) can only be placed on a tube whose top ball is also 1 (or an empty tube), the empty tube E is ideal. So, the valid move is to take the top ball from tube B and put it onto tube E.\n\nIn the game notation this move is indicated by the two letters: first letter for the source tube (B) and second for the destination (E).\n\nAnswer: BE","I'll analyze the board first. We have five tubes:\n A: [3, 3, 1, 0]  -> Balls (from bottom up): 3, 3, 1 \n B: [2, 2, 3, 0]  -> Balls: 2, 2, 3 \n C: [2, 3, 1, 1]  -> Balls: 2, 3, 1, 1 (full)\n D: [2, 0, 0, 0]  -> Balls: 2\n E: [1, 0, 0, 0]  -> Balls: 1\n\nNotice each color appears exactly 4 times (color1: four, color2: four, color3: four) and our goal is to end up with three tubes that each contain exactly four balls of the same color.\n\nA major step is to “gather” the balls for each color in one tube. For color 1 we see that tube E already has a 1 at its bottom (and thus its only ball is 1, making its top ball 1). Tube A has a “misplaced” 1 on top of two 3’s. Removing that 1 from tube A will help clear tube A so its bottom two 3’s can later be built into a pure color3 tube. Also, adding the 1 from A to tube E is legal because the ball being moved (a 1) matches the top ball (1) in tube E.\n\nThus the move is: take the top ball from tube A (which is 1) and move it onto tube E. In our two‐letter notation, the first letter represents the source tube and the second letter the target tube. That means our move is “AE.”\n\nSo the answer in the required format is:\n\nAnswer: AE","Here's the reasoning:\n\nLooking at the board, we see that color 1 appears four times overall (two in tube E and two in tube C), so tube E is a good candidate to eventually become the complete tube for color 1. Tube E currently has two balls [1, 1] and two empty spaces.\n\nTube C is [2, 3, 1, 1] with its top ball being a 1. Since the rule requires the ball being moved to either match the color at the top of the destination tube or land in an empty tube, we can move the top ball (a 1) from tube C and add it onto tube E (whose top ball is also a 1). This consolidates the color‐1 balls in one tube.\n\nThus the move is from C (source) to E (target). The final answer in the required format is:\n\nAnswer: CE","I'll analyze the board first.

If we can add one more ball of color 1 onto tube E, it will be complete. In tube C, the top ball is 1 and can be moved. The target tube E has its top ball as 1 (and is not full), so moving a ball from tube C to tube E is permitted by the rule (matching the top ball’s color). \n\nThus, the move is to take the top ball from tube C (which is 1) and drop it on tube E. That move is represented by the letters “C” (source) and “E” (target).\n\nAnswer: CE","We can solve the puzzle by “gathering” all of the same colored balls into one tube.

Look at tube B: its top ball is a 3 and tube A’s visible top (the last non‑empty ball) is also 3. So we can move the ball from tube B to tube A.\n  • Move: from B to A (denoted “BA”).\n  After this move:\n   – Tube A becomes: [3, 3, 3, 0] \n   – Tube B becomes: [2, 2, 0, 0]\n\n2.

Now, focus on making a tube of 2’s. Tube B already has two 2’s at the bottom. Its top ball is 2, so we can add more 2’s to it. Tube C (now [2, 0, 0, 0]) has a single 2 at its bottom. Move that 2 to tube B.\n  • Move: from C to B (“CB”).\n  After this:\n   – Tube B becomes: [2, 2, 2, 0]\n   – Tube C becomes empty: [0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n4. Finally, tube D contains a single 2 at its bottom ([2, 0, 0, 0]). Its top ball is 2 and tube B’s top is 2, so we can pour that ball from tube D to tube B.\n  • Move: from D to B (“DB”).\n  After this move:\n   – Tube B becomes: [2, 2, 2, 2] (fully solved with 2’s)\n   – Tube D becomes empty: [0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow the board is arranged as follows:\n  A: [3, 3, 3, 3]\n  B: [2, 2, 2, 2]\n  E: [1, 1, 1, 1]\nwith the other tubes empty.

Notice that tube E is already solved (four 1’s). We can complete the other two tubes as follows:\n\n• Tube A currently holds [3, 3, 0, 0]. Because its top ball is 3, we can move a 3 onto it.\n• From tube B ([2, 2, 3, 0]), the top ball is a 3. Moving that onto tube A gives:\n  Move 1 – From B to A (written “BA”).

Both tubes B and C have a 3 on top (B: [2, 2, 3, 0] and C: [2, 3, 0, 0]). Since the rules require that the moved ball either match the target tube’s top ball or go into an empty tube, moving the top ball from tube B (a 3) onto tube A (top ball is 3) is a legal move that brings tube A closer to the goal.

Since tube A’s top ball is a 3, moving the 3 from tube C onto tube A is allowed. That move is denoted by “CA” (move the top ball from tube C onto tube A). This not only completes tube A but also sets up the board so that the remaining balls (mainly color 2’s) can be consolidated into another tube in subsequent moves. \n\nAnswer: CA","If we look at the board, tubes A and E are already complete with four balls of the same color (3 in A and 1 in E). The only color left is 2, which appears in tubes B, C, and D. Tube B already has two balls (2,2) while tubes C and D each have one ball (the only ball in each is 2). By moving one of the top balls from either tube C or D onto tube B (whose top ball is 2), we’d add another 2 to tube B. In this case, moving the top ball from tube C to tube B is a valid move. (The rule allows moving a ball when the target tube’s top ball is the same color or if it is empty.)\n\nThus, the move “C to B” (denoted by the two letters CB) is a legal move that consolidates one more 2 in tube B, bringing us closer to eventually having three tubes completely filled with a single color.\n\nAnswer: CB","We already have two solved tubes: Tube A holds four 3's, and Tube E holds four 1's.

Since Tube B’s top ball is also a 2, the move is allowed.

For example, 'Answer: DC' means moving the top ball from tube D onto the top of tube C.\nLevel: 1    Epoch: 15 \nNote: Each tube is displayed in the format [bottom, ..., top].\nA: [3, 3, 3, 3]\nB: [0, 0, 0, 0]\nC: [0, 0, 0, 0]\nD: [2, 2, 2, 2]\nE: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n","action":"CE","score":1,"seed":19,"response":["One good first move is to take the top ball from tube A (a 2) and put it into an empty tube (for example, tube D).

One way to do this is to build the tube for 2’s using tube D (since it already holds a 2), the tube for 3’s by adding to tube A (which already has two 3’s), and the tube for 1’s by using tube E for gathering four 1’s.\n\nOne valid sequence is as follows (each move is written as XY meaning “move the top ball from tube X onto tube Y”):\n\n1. Move from B to E (“BE”):\n • B’s top ball is 1. Since E is empty the move is allowed.\n • After the move, B becomes [2,1,2] and E becomes [1].\n\n2.

Move from B to D (“BD”):\n • Now tube B’s only ball is 2; D’s top ball is 2.\n • B becomes empty and D becomes [2,2,2,2]. (Tube D is now solved with four 2’s.)\n\n6. Move from C to A (“CA”):\n • Tube C’s top ball is 3; A’s top ball is 3.\n • C becomes [1,3,1] and A becomes [3,3,3].\n\n7. Move from C to E (“CE”):\n • With C now [1,3,1] its top ball is 1; E’s top ball is 1.\n • C becomes [1,3] and E becomes [1,1,1].\n\n8.

Move from C to E (“CE”):\n • Finally, tube C’s only ball is 1 and E’s top ball is 1.\n • C becomes empty and E becomes [1,1,1,1] (Tube E is now solved with four 1’s.)\n\nAt the end, three tubes are complete:\n • A: [3,3,3,3]\n • D: [2,2,2,2]\n • E: [1,1,1,1]\nwhile B and C are empty.\n\nTo summarize the moves in order:\nBE, BD, AD, BE, BD, CA, CE, CA, CE\n\nAnswer: BE BD AD BE BD CA CE CA CE","I'll analyze the board:\n\nTube A: [3, 3, 2, 0] → It holds three balls: bottom 3, then 3, then 2 on top.\nTube B: [2, 1, 2, 1] → Four balls (full); top ball is 1.\nTube C: [1, 3, 1, 3] → Four balls (full); top ball is 3.\nTube D: [2, 0, 0, 0] → One ball (2) at the bottom.\nTube E: [0, 0, 0, 0] → Totally empty.\n\nSince moves are only allowed from the top of one tube to either an empty tube or a tube whose top ball matches, examine available moves:\n• In Tube A, the top ball is 2.\n• In Tube D, the top ball is 2 (since its only ball is 2).\n\nThus you can move the top ball (2) from Tube A onto Tube D because Tube D’s current top ball is also 2. This move is legal and contributes to grouping the 2’s (we have a total of four 2’s across the board).\n\nNow I provide the answer in the required format.\n\nAnswer: AD","I'll start by examining the board. The tubes (from bottom to top) are:\n\n A: [3, 3, 0, 0] – two balls (both 3)\n B: [2, 1, 2, 1] – four balls, mixed\n C: [1, 3, 1, 3] – four balls, mixed (top ball is 3)\n D: [2, 2, 0, 0] – two balls (both 2)\n E: [0, 0, 0, 0] – empty\n\nWe note that there are exactly four balls each of three colors:\n • Color 1 is in tubes B and C.\n • Color 2 is in tubes B and D.\n • Color 3 is in tubes A and C.\n\nOur target is to reach a state where three tubes (each will become “solved”) hold four balls of the same color.\n\nOne promising idea is to complete the tube that will hold all the color-3 balls. Currently, tube A already has two 3’s and its top is a 3. Tube C’s top ball is also a 3. Because the rules allow a ball to be moved onto a tube if its top ball matches the moving ball’s color (or the target is empty), we can move the top ball from tube C onto tube A. This move is legal since both the top of tube C and the top of tube A show a 3, and it adds another 3 to tube A (making it [3, 3, 3, 0]).\n\nOnce that move is done the plan can continue (for example, later one can free up the 3 below in tube C by moving the interfering ball into the empty tube E, then move it into tube A, completing the four 3’s). Such a move best initiates a solution toward getting one solved tube (and eventually three solved tubes).\n\nThus, the next move is to move the top ball from tube C to tube A.\n\nAnswer: CA","Below is one winning solution. Notice that you must eventually form three “complete” tubes (each with four balls of one same color). In the board below the colors occur four times overall (color 1 in B, C and color 2 in B, D and color 3 in A, C), so our plan will be to make:\n\n• Tube A become all 3’s (it already holds three 3‐balls and needs a 3 from C).  \n• Tube D become all 2’s (it already has two 2’s and will be topped up by the two 2’s found in B).  \n• Tube C (in combination with tube E) become all 1’s (the four 1’s appear in B, C, and E).\n\nOne winning sequence is as follows. In each move the two–letter code gives the source tube followed by the destination tube.\n\n1. Move the top ball of tube C (a 1) into empty tube E. (CE)  \n  • Now C becomes [1,3,0,0] (its top ball is now 3) and E becomes [1,0,0,0].  \n2. With tube C’s top ball now 3 matching tube A’s top (3), move from C to A. (CA)  \n  • Tube A becomes [3,3,3,3] (completed with 3’s), and C becomes [1,0,0,0].  \n3. To access the 2’s in tube B, remove its top ball (a 1) by moving it onto tube C which already has a 1 on top. (BC)  \n  • Tube B changes from [2,1,2,1] to [2,1,2,0] (top ball now 2) and C becomes [1,1,0,0].  \n4. Now move the top ball from B (a 2) onto tube D where the top is 2. (BD)  \n  • Tube B becomes [2,1,0,0] (its top becomes 1) and D becomes [2,2,2,0].  \n5. Still in tube B the top ball is 1. Remove it by placing it on tube E (whose top is 1). (BE)  \n  • Tube B then becomes [2,0,0,0] and E becomes [1,1,0,0].  \n6. Now with tube B holding only a 2 (at the bottom), move that 2 onto tube D (whose top is 2). (BD)  \n  • Tube B becomes empty and D becomes [2,2,2,2] (completed with 2’s).  \n7. With the remaining 1’s, combine tube E into tube C. First, move the top ball of E (a 1) onto C whose top is 1. (EC)  \n  • Tube E becomes [1,0,0,0] and C becomes [1,1,1,0].  \n8. Finally, move the last 1 from E onto C. (EC)  \n  • Tube E is now empty and C becomes [1,1,1,1] (completed with 1’s).\n\nThe final configuration is:\n  A: [3,3,3,3]  B: [0,0,0,0]  C: [1,1,1,1]  \n  D: [2,2,2,2]  E: [0,0,0,0]\n\nThus, the sequence (each move represented by two letters) is:\n\nCE, CA, BC, BD, BE, BD, EC, EC\n\nAnswer: CECABCBDBEBDECEC","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube B onto tube E. In other words, we take the 1 at the top of tube B and put it into the empty tube E. (Tube E is completely empty, so it automatically accepts any color.) This move isn’t the complete solution but it’s a step toward freeing up tube B so that its next top ball (a 2) can later be correctly transferred on a tube already holding 2’s, and ultimately three tubes can be completed with just one color each.\n\nAnswer: BE","I'll explain my reasoning step by step.\n\nWe have five tubes:\n A: [3, 3, 3, 0] → contains three 3’s (empty slot at the top)\n B: [2, 1, 2, 0] → contains two 2’s and one 1\n C: [1, 3, 1, 0] → contains two 1’s and one 3\n D: [2, 2, 0, 0] → contains two 2’s\n E: [1, 0, 0, 0] → contains one 1\n\nSince overall there are exactly four balls of each color (four 1’s, four 2’s, four 3’s) the winning configuration is to have three tubes completed with all four balls of one color (for instance, one tube for 1’s, one for 2’s, and one for 3’s).\n\nNotice that Tube A already has three 3’s; it only needs one more 3 to become completed (i.e. [3,3,3,3]). Unfortunately, the only missing 3 is inside Tube C but it’s not currently available at the top because Tube C’s top ball is 1. (Remember: the “top ball” is the rightmost nonzero value in the representation.)\n\nTo expose that 3 in Tube C we must remove the current top ball of Tube C. The rules allow us to move the top ball of one tube to another tube provided the destination tube is either empty or its top ball matches the moving ball’s color. The top ball of Tube C is 1, and if we look at Tube E its only ball is a 1 (and it also has plenty of empty slots). Therefore, moving that 1 ball from Tube C onto Tube E is legal and strategically useful.\n\nAfter performing the move from Tube C to Tube E (we denote that as “CE”), Tube C’s new top ball becomes 3. On a subsequent move (for a full solution) we could then move the top 3 from Tube C onto Tube A, completing Tube A with four 3’s. For this step, the correct move according to the rules is “CE.”\n\nThus, based on the board and rules, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: CE","Here’s one step‐by‐step solution that ends with three tubes completely “solved” (one all 3’s, one all 2’s, and one all 1’s):\n\n1. Move the top ball of tube C (which is a 3) onto tube A. (Tube A’s top ball is a 3, so the move is allowed.) This fills tube A with [3,3,3,3].  \n  Move: CA\n\n2. In tube D you already have two 2’s ([2,2,0,0]), and tube B ([2,1,2,0]) has a 2 on top. So move the top ball (2) from tube B over to tube D. Now tube D becomes [2,2,2,0] and tube B becomes [2,1,0,0].  \n  Move: BD\n\n3. To free the remaining 2 in tube B (currently at the bottom, hidden by the 1 on top) so it can later be transferred to tube D, move the top ball (1) from tube B to tube E. Tube E already contains two 1’s ([1,1,0,0]), and its top is a 1. After this move, tube E becomes [1,1,1,0] and tube B is left with [2,0,0,0].  \n  Move: BE\n\n4. Now the only ball in tube B is the 2. Since tube D’s top is a 2, move that 2 from tube B to tube D. This completes tube D with [2,2,2,2].  \n  Move: BD\n\n5. Finally, look at the 1’s. Tube E currently has three 1’s, and tube C holds a single 1 ([1,0,0,0]). Move that top ball (1) from tube C to tube E (which has a 1 on top) to complete tube E as [1,1,1,1].  \n  Move: CE\n\nAfter these moves the board is solved:\n  • Tube A: [3,3,3,3]\n  • Tube D: [2,2,2,2]\n  • Tube E: [1,1,1,1]\n\nAnswer: CA BD BE BD CE","We can “complete” one of the target tubes immediately. Notice that tube A is three‐filled with 3’s ([3,3,3,0]) and tube C holds a 3 at its top ([1,3,0,0]). Since a ball may be moved onto a tube whose top ball is the same color, you may move the top ball of tube C (a 3) onto tube A. That move makes tube A become [3,3,3,3]—a complete column of 3’s—and sets you along the path to achieving three tubes each with four balls of the same color.\n\nThus the move is “CA” (move from tube C onto tube A).\n\nAnswer: CA","I'll start by considering the board:\n • Tube A: [3, 3, 3, 3] is already complete.\n • Tube B: [2, 1, 2, 0] – its current top (the last nonempty ball) is 2.\n • Tube C: [1, 0, 0, 0] – top ball is 1.\n • Tube D: [2, 2, 0, 0] – top ball is 2.\n • Tube E: [1, 1, 0, 0] – top ball is 1.\n\nWe notice there are four 2’s in total (two in B and two in D) so eventually one tube of 2’s is our target, while the four 1’s (from tubes B, C, and E) can form the other solved tube. (Tube A of 3’s is already solved.) \n\nA good strategic move is to help merge the 2’s. In Tube B the top ball is 2; since Tube D’s top is also 2, we can move that ball from B to D. That move is legal because the moving ball (2) matches the top of Tube D. After the move:\n • Tube D becomes [2, 2, 2, 0] (three 2’s in place).\n • Tube B becomes [2, 1, 0, 0] with 1 now at its top.\nThis move consolidates the color‐2 balls, setting the stage to complete Tube D by later adding the remaining 2 from B (once it’s available). Meanwhile, the ones can later be merged into either Tube C or E to complete the tube of 1’s.\n\nThus, a strong first move is to move the top ball from Tube B to Tube D.\n\nAnswer: BD","Let's analyze the board.\n\nWe have:\n A: [3, 3, 3, 3] – already a solved tube (all 3’s)\n B: [2, 1, 0, 0] – two balls (bottom 2 then 1 on top)\n C: [1, 0, 0, 0] – one ball (1)\n D: [2, 2, 2, 0] – three balls (all 2’s)\n E: [1, 1, 0, 0] – two balls (both 1’s)\n\nNotice that the only remaining complete sets possible are color 1 (which appear in B, C, and E) or color 2 (which appear in B and D). Count of color 1 balls:\n B has one (top ball 1),\n C has one,\n E has two,\n Total = 4.\nThey must end up in one tube completely filled with 1’s.\nAlso, tube D already contains three 2’s. It needs one extra color‑2 ball to be solved. And tube A is already done.\n\nA solution in three moves is as follows:\n\n1. Move the top ball from tube B (which is 1) to tube E. \n • Tube E already has a top ball 1, so the move is allowed.\n • New state:\n  B: [2, 0, 0, 0] (only ball 2 remains)\n  E: [1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n2. Move the top ball from tube C (which is 1) to tube E.\n • Tube E’s top ball is now 1.\n • New state: \n  C becomes empty and \n  E becomes [1, 1, 1, 1] (solved)\n\n3. Now, tube D (with three 2’s) needs one more 2. The only available extra 2 is in tube B.\n • Tube B’s top (and only) ball is 2. Tube D’s top ball is 2.\n • Move the top ball from tube B to tube D.\n • New state: \n  B becomes empty and \n  D becomes [2, 2, 2, 2] (solved)\n\nAfter these moves the three solved tubes are A ([3,3,3,3]), D ([2,2,2,2]), and E ([1,1,1,1]).\n\nFollowing the rule that each move is indicated by two letters (source then destination), the moves are:\n\n• Move 1: BE (ball from B → E)\n• Move 2: CE (ball from C → E)\n• Move 3: BD (ball from B → D)\n\nThus, the concise answer sequence is “BE CE BD.”\n\nAnswer: BE CE BD","We need to think carefully. Out of the five tubes the only one already “solved” is tube A ([3, 3, 3, 3]). In order to finish the game we want two more tubes to end up with four identical balls. (Notice that the balls come in colors 1, 2, and 3 and that we have exactly four balls of each.) One of the nearly‐complete tubes is tube D. It currently contains three 2’s ([2, 2, 2, 0]) so if we could add one more “2” to D then it would become solved (four 2’s). However, none of the top balls immediately available are “2” – tube B is [2, 1, 0, 0] (top ball 1), and the others with “1” (tubes C and E) have top ball 1 as well.\n\nThat observation suggests we first want to “free” the hidden 2 from tube B. Right now tube B is [2, 1, 0, 0] with the top ball 1 “blocking” access to the 2 at the bottom. We can remove this top 1 by moving it to a tube where the top ball is also 1 (or an empty tube). Notice that tube E is [1, 1, 0, 0] whose top is 1. So if we move the top ball in B (1) onto tube E (which already has a 1 on top) the move is legal, and afterward tube B will be left with its hidden 2 at the top.\n\nAfter doing that move:\n • Tube A remains [3, 3, 3, 3] (solved).\n • Tube B becomes [2, 0, 0, 0] (its only ball now is 2, and it is on top).\n • Tube C remains [1, 0, 0, 0].\n • Tube D is still [2, 2, 2, 0] (and now with tube B available one could later move the 2 from B to D to complete it).\n • Tube E becomes [1, 1, 1, 0].\n\nThis move is a promising first step toward eventually having three tubes completely filled with a single color. Thus the two‐letter notation for this move is “BE” – meaning “move the top ball from tube B to tube E.”\n\nAnswer: BE","We can complete one of the “almost complete” same‐color tubes in one move. Notice that tube D has three 2’s ([2, 2, 2, 0]) and tube B has a 2 at its bottom ([2, 0, 0, 0]). The move is allowed because the top ball of tube B (a 2) can be placed on tube D whose current top is also 2, and tube D is not full. After this move, tube D will have four 2’s and become complete. (Tube A is already complete with four 3’s, and later a similar move—moving the top 1 from tube C onto tube E—can complete tube E so that three tubes contain four same-colored balls.)\n\nThus, the intended next move is to pour the ball from tube B onto tube D.\n\nAnswer: BD","The move is to transfer the top ball from tube C (which is a 1) to tube E. In tube E, the top ball is 1, so the move is legal. After this move, tube E will have [1, 1, 1, 1], achieving the desired condition. The three tubes containing four balls of the same color will then be A (all 3s), D (all 2s), and E (all 1s).\n\nAnswer: CE"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Also, by moving balls we want to eventually achieve three tubes that are completely uniform (all four balls the same color). \n\nLooking at the board:\n• Tube A: [2, 0, 0, 0] – the only ball present is a 2.\n• Tube E: [2, 2, 0, 0] – its top ball is 2.\n• Tube D: [3, 3, 3, 3] – already complete.\n\nSince tube E has two balls of color2 at the bottom, adding another ball of color2 will help progress it toward becoming uniform. Tube A’s top ball is also a 2, and since tube E’s top ball is 2 (and thus matches), moving from A to E is a legal move. In doing so, tube E will then have three balls of color2 and tube A will become empty, which can later help with organizing the remaining balls.\n\nSo the move is from tube A to tube E.\n\nAnswer: AE","I'll start by noting the situation. We already have one solved tube – tube D is [3,3,3,3]. We also see that the remaining colors appear in small clusters (for example, the total count of 4’s is 4 – two from tube B and two from tube C – which can be combined into one full tube) while the other colors can be similarly grouped. One natural idea is to start building one of the tubes that will eventually be “solved.” \n\nObserve tube B has the top ball 4. Tube A is completely empty, so it’s a legal destination (empty tubes always accept a ball regardless of its color). By moving the top ball (4) from tube B into tube A the board begins to free up moves that will help us eventually consolidate color 4 into a full tube. (Later moves would be used to free any blocking non-4’s and then move the remaining 4’s into tube A.) \n\nThus the next valid move is to move from tube B to tube A. \n\nAnswer: BA","One promising next move is to remove the top ball from tube B (a ball 4) and put it onto tube A. Initially, tube A has a 4 at its bottom and its top ball is 4, so moving a 4 ball there is legal. After this move, tube B’s configuration becomes [1,2,0,0] (thus exposing its 2), which sets up a later opportunity to complete tube E (which holds three 2’s) by moving that 2 on top. This move helps progress toward having three tubes each filled with four balls of a single color (specifically, tubes D, E, and a later one to be completed).\n\nAnswer: BA","I'll explain my reasoning. Looking at the board, we see that Tube D is already complete with four 3’s. Our next best chance is to complete another tube that is almost uniform. Tube E currently shows [2, 2, 2, 0] – it has three 2’s and an empty space on top. To fill Tube E correctly it needs one more 2. We check the other tubes and notice that Tube B is [1, 2, 0, 0] so its top ball is a 2. Since the rule allows us to move a ball onto a tube whose top ball is the same color, moving the top ball from Tube B to Tube E is legal. After that move, Tube E becomes [2, 2, 2, 2] (fully completed with 2’s) and now we have two tubes complete (Tube D and Tube E). (The overall goal is to eventually have three tubes uniform, but this move is the key step toward that goal.) \n\nThus, the move is to take the ball from Tube B and move it to Tube E.\n\nAnswer: BE","I'll analyze the board first. Notice that tubes D and E are already finished (they each have four balls of a single color). That means the objective is to get one more tube to be uniform. Tube A currently has two 4’s ([4, 4, 0, 0]), so if we can complete it with two more 4’s it becomes the third finished tube. Looking at tube C ([4, 1, 1, 4]), the top ball is 4. Since the rule allows a move if the destination’s top ball is the same color (or the tube is empty), we can move the top ball of tube C to tube A. This move puts a 4 on top of tube A (which already has a top 4) and is a legal move.\n\nThus the move is to take the top ball from tube C and place it on tube A. In our move notation the first letter identifies the source and the second the destination. So the answer is CA.\n\nAnswer: CA","We first analyze the board. There are six tubes (A–F):\n\n• Tube D: [3, 3, 3, 3] and Tube E: [2, 2, 2, 2] are already “solved” (they have 4 balls of the same color).  \n• To reach the goal of having three solved tubes, we want to complete one more tube.  \n• Tube A has three 4’s ([4, 4, 4, 0]) so it only needs one more 4 to become complete.  \n• The only extra 4 is hiding at the bottom of Tube C ([4, 1, 1, 0]), but it’s blocked by two 1’s. Thus, our plan is to remove the top two 1’s from Tube C.  \n• According to the rules, we can only move the topmost ball, and it must be placed onto a tube whose top ball is the same color, or an empty tube.  \n• Tubes B ([1, 0, 0, 0]) and F ([1, 0, 0, 0]) already contain a 1 as their only ball, which allows a 1 to be added.  \n• The first step is to move the top ball of Tube C (a 1) onto another tube that has a 1 – for example, Tube B.\n\nThus the next move is to take the top ball from Tube C and move it onto Tube B. In the required two–letter format (source tube followed by target tube) this move is represented by “CB.”\n\nAnswer: CB","Let's analyze the board. We already have two solved tubes: Tube D is [3, 3, 3, 3] (all 3’s) and Tube E is [2, 2, 2, 2] (all 2’s). That leaves us with the possibility of “solving” one more tube so that it has four balls of the same color. Notice that Tube A currently holds three 4’s ([4, 4, 4, 0]). To complete it we need one more 4 on top. However, the only tube that contains a 4 is Tube C, which is [4, 1, 0, 0]. Its top ball is currently 1. We cannot move its 4 (which lies underneath) until the top ball is removed. \n\nThus we proceed in two moves:\n\n1. Move the top ball from Tube C (which is a 1) to a tube where a 1 is already at the top. Tube B is [1, 1, 0, 0] (top ball 1) or Tube F is [1, 0, 0, 0] (top ball 1). For example, moving from Tube C to Tube B is allowed. After this move, Tube C becomes [4, 0, 0, 0] (with 4 now at the top) and Tube B becomes [1, 1, 1, 0].\n\n2. Now Tube C’s top ball is 4. We can legally move this ball onto Tube A, which has a top ball of 4 ([4, 4, 4, 0]). After the second move, Tube A becomes [4, 4, 4, 4] — a solved tube.\n\nThus the sequence of moves is:\n• First move: From Tube C to Tube B (“CB”)\n• Second move: From Tube C to Tube A (“CA”)\n\nThese two moves complete three tubes with four same-color balls (Tubes A, D, and E).\n\nAnswer: CB CA","We already have two complete tubes – D ([3,3,3,3]) and E ([2,2,2,2]). Notice that the only remaining color that appears exactly four times is the 1’s. Currently the 1’s are split among B ([1,1,0,0]), C ([4,1,0,0]) and F ([1,0,0,0]). Tube B already has two 1’s, and its top (the last non‐empty ball) is a 1 so it will only accept 1’s. Therefore, if we can add the remaining two 1’s to B the game is won.\n\nStep 1:\nMove the top ball from tube C to tube B.\n• Tube C’s top ball is 1 (since its list is [4, 1, 0, 0]), and tube B’s top ball is 1.\nAfter this move:\n B becomes [1, 1, 1, 0]\n C becomes [4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 2:\nMove the top ball from tube F to tube B.\n• Tube F’s top ball is 1 and tube B now has 1 at its top.\nAfter this move:\n B becomes [1, 1, 1, 1]   (a complete tube of 1’s)\n F becomes [0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow tubes B, D, and E each contain exactly four balls of the same color.\n\nTherefore, the two moves are:\n First move: “CB”  (from tube C to tube B)\n Second move: “FB”  (from tube F to tube B)\n\nAnswer: CB FB","I'll start by noting the board’s status. Tubes D and E are already finished with four balls of a single color (all 3’s in D and all 2’s in E). So we need one more tube to be completed with four balls of a single color.\n\nOne good option is to complete tube B with all color1. Currently, tube B is: [1, 1, 0, 0] (with its top ball being 1) and the total ones available are in B (two of them), plus one in tube C (on top) and one in tube F. To group all ones together, we can make a move that helps begin that process. In this case, notice that tube C is [4, 1, 0, 0] with its top ball 1 “blocking” access to the bottom 4 that could later help complete tube A—but we are focusing on the ones here. \n\nA good first move is to move the top ball from tube C (a 1) onto tube B because tube B’s top is also 1. This move (denoted “CB”) results in:\n• Tube B becomes [1, 1, 1, 0] (adding the new 1 on top),\n• Tube C becomes [4, 0, 0, 0] (with its only remaining ball a 4).\n\nAfter this, tube B is one move away from being filled by color1—by subsequently moving the remaining 1 from tube F onto B (since F is currently [1, 0, 0, 0]). Then tube B would be [1, 1, 1, 1], giving us our third uniform tube (along with D and E).\n\nThus, the move “from C to B” is a smart next move.\n\nAnswer: CB","We observe that the tubes D and E are already complete with four balls of the same color (3’s in tube D and 2’s in tube E). Meanwhile, tube A currently has three 4’s ([4, 4, 4, 0]) and needs one more 4 to be completed. Tube C contains a single 4 ([4, 0, 0, 0]). Since the rule requires that the moved ball must match the top ball of the destination tube (or the destination is empty), we check tube A: its top ball is 4, so it qualifies. Therefore, by moving the top (and only) ball from tube C onto tube A, tube A becomes complete as [4, 4, 4, 4]. That gives us three tubes (A, D, E) that each contain exactly four balls of the same color. \n\nHence, the correct move is to move the ball from tube C onto tube A.\n\nAnswer: CA","I'll analyze the board first:\n• Tube A: [4, 4, 4, 4] is already complete.\n• Tube D: [3, 3, 3, 3] is already complete.\n• Tube E: [2, 2, 2, 2] is already complete.\n• Tube B: [1, 1, 1, 0] has three balls of color 1 and one empty space.\n• Tube F: [1, 0, 0, 0] has a single ball of color 1, with three empty spaces above.\n\nSince our goal is to obtain three tubes (in this case we already have A, D, and E) with four balls of the same color, the puzzle appears to be nearly solved. However, to make use of the remaining balls politely, we can complete tube B with the correct move: The top ball of tube F is the lone 1, and since tube B’s top ball is also 1 (and it has an empty slot), we can move the top ball from tube F onto tube B.\n\nThus, the move is from tube F to tube B.\n\nAnswer: FB"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Notice tube C is [4, 4, 1, 4] with a top‐ball 4. We want to eventually clear out the odd ball (the “1”) buried in tube C so that we can have a complete tube of 4’s. Moving its top ball (a 4) is allowed because tube E is empty. Therefore, the move is to pour the top ball from tube C onto tube E.\n\nAnswer: CE","One promising step is to use one of the empty tubes to “free” a ball that is covering a color we’d like to consolidate. For example, notice that tube A currently is full with [2, 1, 2, 3] so the top ball 3 is “blocking” the 2’s beneath. If we move that top 3 from A into an empty tube (tube F is currently empty), then tube A will become [2, 1, 2] so its new accessible top ball is 2. (Remember that when a tube isn’t completely filled, its top ball is the last non‐zero ball in the list.) Now, with tube A’s top now 2 and tube D’s top already 2 (since D = [2, 3, 1, 2]), a later move could combine these 2’s toward forming a tube that has four 2’s. This helps toward our overall goal of ending up with three tubes that are “solved” (i.e. all four balls in that tube are of the same color).\n\nSince tube F is empty the rule allows us to move any ball there. So we choose the move “AF”, meaning move the top ball from tube A (which is the 3) onto tube F. \n\nAnswer: AF","I'll analyze the board first.

For example, the top ball of B is a 3 and F’s top (currently its only ball) is also 3. So moving from B to F is permitted. (Note that when a move is made, only one ball is moved.)\n\nIn the move “BF” we take the top ball 3 from tube B and place it onto tube F (where the top is 3), resulting in\n\n B: [1, 3, 4, 0]      F: [3, 3, 0, 0].\n\nThis move is valid and—given the overall objective of eventually making three tubes completely uniform—appears to advance the consolidation process (for instance, later the fours and twos may be grouped and one solved tube might be formed with color 2 or 4, while color 3 can eventually be gathered in F). \n\nThus, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: BF","I examined the board and noticed that the color 4 appears in tubes B, C, and E; with tube E already holding a 4 at its bottom, it’s legal and strategic to move another 4 onto it. In tube B the top ball is 4, and since tube E’s visible top ball is also 4, we can move ball 4 from tube B onto tube E. This move is legal (the ball matches the target’s top color) and it helps start gathering the 4’s together for one complete uniform tube.\n\nAnswer: BE","I'll start by checking the tubes and the legal moves. (Remember: each tube has capacity 4, a “0” means an empty slot, and the “top ball” is the last non‐zero number in the 4–element list. Also, when moving a ball, you must put it onto an empty tube OR – if the target tube isn’t empty – its top ball must have the same color.)\n\nHere is the board:\n A: [2, 1, 2, 0] → three balls (bottom 2, then 1, then 2 at the top)\n B: [1, 3, 0, 0] → two balls (bottom 1, top 3)\n C: [4, 4, 1, 0] → three balls (bottom 4, then 4, then 1)\n D: [2, 3, 1, 2] → four balls (full – bottom 2, then 3, then 1, then 2 at top)\n E: [4, 4, 0, 0] → two balls (both 4’s)\n F: [3, 3, 0, 0] → two balls (both 3’s)\n\nNotice that if we look at the color counts:\n – Color 1 appears exactly 4 times (in A, B, C, D)\n – Color 2 appears exactly 4 times (in A and D)\n – Color 3 appears 4 times (in B, D, F)\n – Color 4 appears 4 times (in C and E)\n\nThus there is in principle a way to have three solved tubes (each with four balls of a single color). For example, one useful idea is to “expose” the balls that are blocking a uniform stack. Look at tube D. Although it is full and mixed – [2, 3, 1, 2] – its top ball is 2 and it “hides” the 1 (which belongs with the other 1’s) underneath. We notice tube A already has a top ball 2 and room for one more ball (because its pattern is [2,1,2,0]). That means we can legally move the top ball from D (which is 2) onto tube A. (The move is legal because the ball moved from D is a 2 and the top ball of A is also 2.) \n\nAfter that move the tubes update as follows:\n • Tube D becomes [2, 3, 1, 0] (three balls – now its top is 1, so that 1 is “uncovered” and available for later moves).\n • Tube A becomes [2, 1, 2, 2] (full; although it’s not uniform yet, this move is designed to help “free” a needed ball from D so that later the color‐1 balls – which total four – can eventually be gathered in one tube).\n\nThis move “DA” (move from D to A) is a correct first step given the rules and the goal.\n\nAnswer: DA","I analyzed the board and noticed that tube C is holding [4, 4, 1, 0] with the top actual ball being the “1” (since 0 represents empty space). In tube D the current content is [2, 3, 1, 0] with the top ball also “1.” By moving the top ball from tube C onto tube D, you legally place a 1 onto a tube already topped by 1. This move not only clears the way in tube C (revealing a “4” that will help in completing a uniform tube of color 4 later) but also begins to consolidate balls in tube D. (Later moves can be planned so that three tubes become fully uniform in color.) \n\nThus, the recommended move is to move the top ball from tube C onto tube D.\n\nAnswer: CD","I analyzed the board. Notice that tubes C and E both contain only 4’s – each has two 4’s. If we begin to combine these two sets by pouring a top 4 from one into the other, we can eventually complete one tube full of 4’s (that is, get [4, 4, 4, 4]) while leaving an empty tube as spare. For example, tube C currently shows [4, 4, 0, 0] (with a top of 4) and tube E shows [4, 4, 0, 0] (with a top of 4). The rules allow moving the top ball if its color matches the top of the target tube. So by taking the top ball from tube E and placing it on tube C, the move is legal and sets us on a good track toward the goal.\n\nThus, the move is from tube E to tube C.\n\nAnswer: EC","I'll analyze the board first. Right now, tube C has [4, 4, 4, 0] so it contains three balls, all 4’s, and still has one free space on top. According to the rules, if you move a ball onto a tube that isn’t empty, its color must match the top ball of that tube. Tube C’s top ball is 4. Looking at the board, tube E has [4, 0, 0, 0] – its top (and only) ball is a 4. Therefore, moving the top ball from tube E onto tube C is valid, and it will complete tube C as [4, 4, 4, 4], which is one of the three uniform tubes needed. \n\nThus, the move is to move the ball from tube E to tube C.\n\nAnswer: EC","I'll analyze the board step by step:\n\n• Tube C is already complete with four balls of color 4.\n• There are a total of four balls each of colors 1, 2, and 3 spread over the other tubes.\n• To eventually form a uniform tube of color 3, note that Tube F currently has two 3’s and its top ball is 3. Tube B’s visible top ball is a 3 while its other ball is 1.\n• The rule allows moving a ball onto a tube if its top ball is the same color (or if the tube is empty). So, moving the top ball (3) from Tube B to Tube F is legal since Tube F’s top ball is 3.\n• After that move, Tube F becomes [3, 3, 3, 0] (three 3’s), while Tube B will have only a single ball (1) remaining.\n• This step is a promising beginning toward finishing one of the uniform tubes.\n\nThus, the move is: move the top ball from Tube B to Tube F.\n\nAnswer: BF","We can solve the puzzle in six legal moves. One solution is as follows:\n\n1. From tube D (which currently is [2,3,1,1]) move the top ball (a 1) onto tube B ([1]). Because tube B’s top is 1, the move D→B is legal.\n  After move: D becomes [2,3,1] and B becomes [1,1].\n\n2. Do the same from D again. Now its top is 1, and moving that to B (whose top is still 1) is allowed.\n  After move: D is now [2,3] and B becomes [1,1,1].\n\n3. With D now having top ball 3 (its sequence [2,3]), we can move that 3 onto tube F (which is [3,3,3]).

To form a third complete tube we can “assemble” all 1’s into tube B. Currently, tube B has three 1’s but one more 1 is needed. The only extra 1 is in tube A ([2,1,2,2]) but it is not accessible because the top ball is 2. So we must remove the top balls from A until the 1 is exposed.\n\n4. Move A’s top ball (2) onto tube D.

Tube B already has a 1 at its top, and it isn’t full, so this move is legal. This helps gather the 1’s together (since there are a total of four 1’s in the game), moving us toward having three tubes with four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: DB","I'll start by explaining one winning strategy. One viable plan is to make tube C (already complete with four 4’s) one of the uniform tubes, then complete tube B with 1’s and tube F with 3’s. For example, one can begin with the following move sequence:\n\n1. Move the top ball of tube D (which is 1) onto tube B (whose top is 1), so that tube B becomes [1,1,1] (with one ball missing) and tube D becomes [2,3]. \n2. Then remove the “blocking” 2’s from tube A (which is [2,1,2,2]) by moving the top ball from A into an empty tube (tube E) to eventually reach the lone 1 in A. \n3. Then move that 1 from tube A into tube B to complete it as [1,1,1,1]. \n4. Finally, top up tube F (which is [3,3,3]) with a 3 taken from tube D (after the previous moves expose the 3) so that tube F becomes [3,3,3,3].\n\nAfter these moves tubes B, C, and F are the three uniform tubes.\n\nSince the rules require you to give two letters indicating a single move – that is, moving the top ball from one tube (first letter) to another (second letter) – one acceptable first move in the above strategy is to move the top ball from tube D to tube B.\n\nTherefore, the move is indicated as:\n\nAnswer: DB","We can win this level in a series of legal moves. One of the first moves is to “solve” the three‐ball tube F (currently [3, 3, 3, 0]). Notice that tube D holds [2, 3, 0, 0] and its top ball is 3. Since the move rule allows moving a ball if it matches the target’s top ball (or the target is empty), we can take the top ball (3) from D and pour it onto F. This move turns tube F into [3, 3, 3, 3] (four 3’s in a row), which becomes one of our “solved” tubes. (Later the plan is to use similar moves to fix the tubes with 1’s and 2’s.) \n\nSo the immediate winning move is to move the top ball from D onto F, which we denote with the two‐letter command “DF.”\n\nAnswer: DF","The key idea is to expose the “hidden” 1 ball in tube A so that we can eventually complete a tube with all 1’s (since tube B already has three 1’s). Right now, tube A is [2, 1, 2, 2] (bottom to top) so its top ball is a 2. By moving that top 2 from A onto a tube with a top 2—in this case tube D (which currently holds a single 2, i.e. [2, 0, 0, 0])—we follow the rule (ball color matches the top of the target tube) and also uncover the lower balls in tube A. After this move:\n • Tube A becomes [2, 1, 2] (with top ball now 2, but eventually after moving out the extra 2’s the 1 will be exposed),\n • Tube D becomes [2, 2] (gaining another 2, which will later help to form a complete color-2 tube if needed).\nThis move (from A to D, or “AD”) is a proper first step according to the rules.\n\nAnswer: AD","We can start by exposing the hidden ball we need later. Notice that tube A contains 2, 1, 2 (from bottom to top) and the top ball is 2. Meanwhile, tube D’s top ball is 2 as well. This means we can move the top ball of A (which is 2) to D, since the moved ball must match D’s top ball. After that move, tube A will have its top ball become 1 (which will be useful for completing tube B [1,1,1] by moving this ball onto it), and tube D will have three 2’s. (A subsequent move would then be moving that 1 from A to B to complete a tube—all while already having tube C and tube F filled by one color.) \n\nThus the valid move to start the solution is to move the top ball from tube A to tube D.\n\nAnswer: AD","We'll check the board.

Tube A’s top ball is also 1. By moving the top ball from A to B, the ball’s color will match the top ball of B. After the move, tube B will become [1, 1, 1, 1]—a tube with four balls of the same color. Then, tubes B, C, and F will be the three completed tubes with unified colors.\n\nThus, the move is to transfer the top ball from tube A onto tube B.\n\nAnswer: AB","Analyzing the board:\n• Tube A: [2, 0, 0, 0] – contains one ball (color 2).\n• Tube D: [2, 2, 2, 0] – contains three balls (all color 2) and one empty space.\n• Tubes B, C, and F are already “solved” (each having four balls of a single color).\n\nSince our aim is to have three tubes where each tube holds exactly four balls of the same color, we can form another solved tube by combining the lone 2 from tube A with the three 2’s in tube D. According to the rules, moving a ball is allowed if it matches the color of the top ball on the target tube (or the target tube is empty). Tube D’s top is color 2 and the ball from tube A is also color 2, so this move is allowed.\n\nThus, the move is to take the top ball from Tube A and move it onto Tube D, which makes Tube D become [2,2,2,2] (a solved tube).

Our goal is to end up with three tubes filled with four balls that are all the same color. One promising strategy is to start gathering the 1’s (color 1) into one tube. For example, tube A has a 1 at its top while another 1 appears in tube C and tube B (buried inside). Using an empty tube as a target is always allowed, so one good move is to take the top ball from tube A (which is a 1) and move it to one of the empty tubes (say D). This “AD” move is valid because tube D is empty, and it begins to set up a target tube for color 1. Later moves can then assemble the remaining 1’s into tube D (or another target) to eventually have four 1’s in one tube. \n\nAnswer: AD","I'll analyze the board. We have five tubes (A–E) with capacity 4. A “0” indicates an empty slot. Thus the current filled balls are:\n\n• Tube A: [3, 3, 2, 0] → contains 3 balls: 3 (bottom), 3, then 2 (top).\n• Tube B: [2, 1, 2, 2] → full with balls 2, 1, 2, 2 (top).\n• Tube C: [1, 3, 3, 1] → full with balls 1, 3, 3, 1 (top).\n• Tube D: [1, 0, 0, 0] → contains a single ball: 1.\n• Tube E: [0, 0, 0, 0] → empty.\n\nThere are exactly 4 balls of each color:\n Color 1: Tube C (two), Tube B (one), Tube D (one)\n Color 2: Tube A (one), Tube B (three)\n Color 3: Tube A (two), Tube C (two)\n\nThe goal is to have three tubes each completely filled (4 balls) with all balls of the same color. One promising start is to work on consolidating the color that has exactly 4 total balls. Notice color 1 appears in tubes C, B, and D. Tube D is almost empty and already has a 1 at its bottom. If we move the top ball from tube C (which is a 1) onto tube D, that move is legal because the top of tube D is 1 (matching the moving ball) and there is space. This move will begin grouping the color1 balls into one tube.\n\nThus, the move to take is from tube C to tube D, i.e. \"CD\".\n\nAnswer: CD","I'll start by describing one way to progress.\n\nOne promising plan is to eventually form a tube of four 3’s. Notice that tube A currently is:\n  A: [3, 3, 2, 0]\n—that is, from bottom up it holds two 3’s then a 2, with one empty space on top. Tube C holds two 3’s (along with a 1 at the bottom):\n  C: [1, 3, 3, 0]\nIf we can remove the top ball (the 2) from tube A, then tube A will contain just the two 3’s. Next, we can pour the top 3 from tube C onto tube A (because its current top ball will be 3), and then the next 3 from C onto A to form a full tube [3, 3, 3, 3]. That will complete one solved tube.\n\nThe very first move to start this plan is to remove the stray 2 from tube A. The top ball of A is 2 (since the rightmost nonzero digit represents the top ball) and tube E is completely empty so it can legally accept any ball.\n\nThus, the move is: move the top ball from tube A to tube E.\n\nFollowing the required format, the move is represented by the letters “AE” (source A, destination E).\n\nAnswer: AE","I analyzed the board and found that tube A already has two balls of color 3 (its two non‐empty slots are [3,3]), and tube C has two balls of color 3 on top of a 1. If we move the top ball from tube C (which is a 3) onto tube A, the move is legal because the top ball in tube A is also a 3. This move helps in building a pure tube of 3’s.\n\nThus, the move is to take the top ball from tube C and move it onto tube A, which is denoted as “CA.”\n\nAnswer: CA","I'll analyze the board. We have:\n\n• Tube A: [3, 3, 3, 0] → three balls of 3 (with one empty slot on top); its top ball (by the highest filled slot) is 3.\n• Tube B: [2, 1, 2, 2] → full.\n• Tube C: [1, 3, 0, 0] → two balls (bottom 1 then 3); its top ball is 3.\n• Tube D: [1, 1, 0, 0] → two balls; its top ball is 1.\n• Tube E: [2, 0, 0, 0] → one ball of 2.\n\nThe total counts are:\n– Color 3: 3 balls in A + 1 in C = 4.\n– Color 1: 1 in B + 1 in C + 2 in D = 4.\n– Color 2: 3 in B + 1 in E = 4.\n\nOur goal is to have three tubes, each completely filled with four balls of the same color. Notice that Tube A already has three 3’s. Its top filled ball is 3 and it has an empty slot available. Tube C’s top ball is also 3. Since a move is allowed if the moved ball either matches the target's top color or if the target tube is empty, moving the top ball 3 from Tube C to Tube A is a valid move. This will complete Tube A as [3, 3, 3, 3] – one solved tube.\n\nSo the move is: move the top ball from Tube C onto Tube A.\n\nAnswer: CA","We first note that tube A is already complete with four 3’s. Notice that the other balls include exactly four 1’s and exactly four 2’s distributed in the remaining tubes. One promising strategy is to eventually consolidate the 2’s into one tube. For example, tube B currently holds [2, 1, 2, 2] (from bottom to top), and tube E holds [2, 0, 0, 0] (so its only ball is a 2). Although tube B is full, its top ball (the last digit) is a 2, and tube E’s top ball is also a 2. According to the rules, you may move a top ball onto a tube whose top ball matches its color (as long as the tube isn’t full). Thus by moving the top ball of tube B (a 2) onto tube E, tube E will then contain two 2’s, and tube B will be one ball “short” of being full. This move helps begin the process of gathering all four 2’s together (recall there are exactly four 2’s in total).\n\nSo the move is to take the top ball from tube B and place it onto tube E – which we denote by the letter pair “BE.”\n\nAnswer: BE","I'll examine the board. Tube A is already solved with [3, 3, 3, 3]. We need to finish two tubes—one completely with 1’s and one completely with 2’s. Notice that there are four 1’s in total (one in B, one in C, two in D) and four 2’s in total (two in B, two in E). However, in tube B the top ball is a 2 while the 1 is buried below. By moving that top 2 from tube B, we’ll eventually free the 1 for consolidation into a tube for 1’s. Also note that tube E already has two 2’s ([2, 2, 0, 0]) and its top (the last nonempty ball) is a 2. Moving the 2 from tube B onto tube E is legal (since the ball being moved matches the color on top of the target tube) and will help complete the set for 2’s. \n\nThus, the best move is to move the top ball from tube B to tube E. \n\nAnswer: BE","One move that contributes to solving the puzzle is to move the top ball from tube B onto tube D. In tube B the top ball is a 1 (with tube B showing [2, 1, 0, 0]), and tube D’s top ball is also a 1 (since tube D is [1, 1, 0, 0]). This move is allowed because the ball being moved (1) matches the color of the top ball in the target tube (also 1). After this move, tube B becomes [2, 0, 0, 0] (revealing its bottom ball 2) and tube D becomes [1, 1, 1, 0] (now having three 1’s). This helps set up one full tube (tube A is already solved with four 3’s) and paves the way to combine all the 1’s into a complete tube later on, aiming for three tubes of uniform color.\n\nAnswer: BD","To reach the goal, note that tube A is already complete with four 3’s. Tube E has three 2’s and needs one more 2, while tube B has a 2 that can be moved there. Also, tube D has three 1’s and tube C has a 1 that can be added to it.\n\nThus, the moves are:\n1. Move the top ball from tube B (a 2) onto tube E (whose top is a 2), giving tube E: [2, 2, 2, 2].\n2. Move the top ball from tube C (a 1) onto tube D (whose top is a 1), giving tube D: [1, 1, 1, 1].\n\nThis results in three tubes (A, D, and E) each filled with four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: BE CD","We can complete the puzzle in two moves. Notice that tube A is already complete with four 3’s. To finish two more tubes, we observe:\n\n• Tube D already has three 1’s ([1, 1, 1, 0]) and tube C has a 1. Since the moving rule allows a ball to be placed on a tube if its top ball matches the moving ball’s color, we can move the top (and only) ball from tube C (a 1) to tube D. This gives tube D four 1’s.\n\n• Tube E has three 2’s ([2, 2, 2, 0]) and tube B contains a 2. We can move the top ball from tube B to tube E since the top ball in tube E is also a 2. This completes tube E with four 2’s.\n\nThus, the two moves are:\n1. Move from C to D.\n2. Move from B to E.\n\nFinal Answer in the required format:\nAnswer: CD BE","The solution is to first complete tube D, which already has three 1’s by moving the only 1 from tube C onto it. This produces tube D with [1,1,1,1]. Then, complete tube E (which already has three 2’s) by moving the 2 from tube B onto it, resulting in [2,2,2,2]. Now, tubes A, D, and E each contain four balls of the same color.\n\nThus, the moves are:\n• Move from tube C to tube D → “CD”\n• Move from tube B to tube E → “BE”\n\nAnswer: CD BE","We note that tube A is already complete with four 3’s. To complete a tube of 2’s we spot that tube E [2,2,2,0] is only missing one ball and tube B [2,0,0,0] has a top ball of 2. Since the ball being moved must match the top ball of the target tube (or the target must be empty), moving the top ball from B (which is 2) onto tube E (whose top ball is 2) is allowed. This move completes tube E as [2,2,2,2] so that tubes A and E are complete, setting the stage for completing the remaining tube (color 1) in a subsequent move.\n\nAnswer: BE","The best move is to pour the top ball from tube D (which is a 1) into tube C. Tube C already contains a 1 at its top, so this move follows the rule that the ball being moved must either match the color at the top of the target tube or that the tube is empty. This way, we start combining the ones from tubes C and D to eventually form a tube with four balls of color 1.\n\nAnswer: DC","We already have two completed tubes (A with four 3’s and E with four 2’s). That means we need the tube with 1’s to be filled. Notice that both C and D contain two 1’s each. One way to complete a tube is to combine the 1’s from one tube into the other. For example, if we move the top ball from D (which is 1) onto C (whose top ball is also 1) the move is allowed. Then C will have three balls of 1 and D will have one ball remaining. Repeating the same move (again moving the top ball from D to C) fills C to four 1’s. Then the three complete tubes are A, C, and E.\n\nThus the moves are:\n1.

One useful first step is to remove the obstructing 2 from tube B so we can later use its 3 at the bottom to build a uniform tube of 3’s.

Tube D’s top ball is 2 (since tube D = [1, 2, 2, 0]) and it still has room for one more ball.

Look at Tube B: It already contains three balls, all 3’s, and it has an empty space at the top. Tube A’s top ball is 3 (since its two balls are 4 and 3, with 3 on top). Therefore, by moving the top 3 ball from A to B, Tube B will become [3, 3, 3, 3] – a complete tube of uniform color 3.

First, move the top 1 from tube C into the empty tube A (an empty tube accepts any ball): CA  \n  • Tube C becomes [4,1,1,0] and tube A becomes [1,0,0,0].\n\n3. Move the next top ball (a 1) in tube C onto tube A (whose top is now 1): CA  \n  • Tube C becomes [4,1,0,0] and tube A becomes [1,1,0,0].\n\n4. Move the remaining top 1 from tube C onto tube A (again legal because the top of A is 1): CA  \n  • Now tube C contains only the 4 ([4,0,0,0]) and tube A holds [1,1,1,0].\n\n5. With the 4 now exposed in tube C, move it onto tube F (whose top is 4): CF  \n  • Tube F becomes complete as [4,4,4,4].\n\n6. Next, look at tube D which is [1,2,2,0]. We want to free the lone 1 at its bottom so we can eventually complete a tube with the 2’s. Use tube E (currently [2,2,0,0]) as the target for gathering 2’s. Move the top 2 from tube D onto tube E (legal since E’s top is 2): DE  \n  • Tube D becomes [1,2,0,0] and tube E becomes [2,2,2,0].\n\n7. Now move the remaining top 2 from tube D onto tube E (again allowed because E’s top is 2): DE  \n  • Tube D is now [1,0,0,0] and tube E becomes complete as [2,2,2,2].\n\nAt this point three tubes are “solved”:  \n • Tube B remains [3,3,3,3] (all 3’s)  \n • Tube F is [4,4,4,4] (all 4’s)  \n • Tube E is [2,2,2,2] (all 2’s)\n\nThus one acceptable move sequence is: AF, CA, CA, CA, CF, DE, DE\n\nAnswer: AF CA CA CA CF DE DE","I'll start by explaining my reasoning. We have six tubes, and we need to eventually arrange so that three tubes become “complete” (i.e. holding exactly four balls that are all the same color). One of the possible strategies is to complete the tube that will collect all the balls of color 2. (Recall that 0 means empty slot and we only care about the nonzero numbers that represent the balls.) \n\nLooking at the board:\n• Tube D currently holds [1, 2, 2] (so its top ball is 2).\n• Tube E holds [2, 2] (its top ball is 2).\n\nSince the rules allow moving a ball onto a tube whose top ball is the same color (or if the target tube is empty), we can move the top ball from D (which is 2) onto tube E. This will put another ball of color 2 onto tube E, making it [2, 2, 2]. (Tube D then becomes [1, 2].) \n\nThis move is a valid step toward eventually filling Tube E with four 2’s (since Tube E already has two 2’s and after one more move from D it will have three, and then a final move could complete it). \n\nTherefore, the move that seems best is to move the top ball from tube D to tube E, which we denote by the two letters “DE”. \n\nAnswer: DE","I'll explain my reasoning. The board is:\n\n A: [4, 0, 0, 0]  \n B: [3, 3, 3, 3]  \n C: [4, 1, 1, 1]  \n D: [1, 2, 0, 0]  \n E: [2, 2, 2, 0]  \n F: [4, 4, 0, 0]\n\nOur goal is to have three tubes fully filled (4 balls) with the same color. Notice that Tube B is already solved (all 3’s). One very natural next step is to finish Tube E by getting it to have four 2’s. Looking at Tube E ([2, 2, 2, 0]), it has three 2’s and one gap. In Tube D, the top ball is a 2 (since D is [1, 2, 0, 0] with the top being the rightmost non-zero value). The rules state that a ball can only be moved if it either lands on an empty tube or its color matches the color on top of the target tube.\n\nSo we can move the top ball (2) from Tube D onto Tube E (whose top is a 2). This move turns Tube E into [2, 2, 2, 2] – a solved tube – while Tube D becomes [1, 0, 0, 0]. With Tube B (color 3) and Tube E (color 2) solved, only one more complete uniform tube is needed to meet the goal.\n\nFollowing the required answer format (two letters where the first is the source tube and the second is the target tube), the move is indicated by “DE” (i.e. from Tube D to Tube E).\n\nAnswer: DE","I studied the board and noticed that two tubes are already complete (B has four 3’s and E has four 2’s). That means our job is to complete one more tube so that it has four balls of the same color. One way to do that is to concentrate all of the 4’s into one tube. Currently the 4’s are in tubes A, C, and F (with tube C having a stray 4 at its bottom but topped by ones). One very natural move is to take the top ball from tube A—which is a 4—and move it onto tube F because tube F’s top ball is also a 4. (Recall the rule: You can move a ball onto a tube if its top ball is the same color or if the tube is empty.) This simple move is legal and helps consolidate the 4’s even though additional moves are needed later. \n\nThus, the move is from tube A to tube F, which is indicated by “AF.”\n\nAnswer: AF","We can complete the game in three moves. Notice that tubes B ([3,3,3,3]) and E ([2,2,2,2]) are already “complete”. Our third complete tube can be made by tube D. It currently has [1,0,0,0] (only a single ball, 1, at the bottom) and can hold 3 more “1”s. In tube C we have [4, 1, 1, 1] (with the bottom ball a 4 and three “1”s on top). If we remove the top three 1’s from tube C—one move at a time onto tube D (which already has a top ball of 1, making the move legal)—then tube C will be left with only the 4 while tube D becomes [1, 1, 1, 1] (a complete tube of 1’s).\n\nThe moves are:\n1. Move the top ball from tube C (a 1) to tube D → (move “CD”)\n2. Move the new top ball from tube C (a 1) to tube D → (move “CD”)\n3. Move the new top ball from tube C (a 1) to tube D → (move “CD”)\n\nAfter these moves, the three “complete” tubes are:\n• Tube B: [3, 3, 3, 3]\n• Tube E: [2, 2, 2, 2]\n• Tube D: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nThus, the required moves (each denoted by “CD”) can be specified as three consecutive “CD” moves.\n\nAnswer: CD CD CD","I'll explain my reasoning.\n\nWe wish to end up with three tubes that each have exactly four balls of the same color. Right now:\n• Tube B is [3, 3, 3, 3] (all 3’s) – already “solved.”\n• Tube E is [2, 2, 2, 2] (all 2’s) – already “solved.”\n\nThat leaves the possibility of making one more tube “uniform.” Look at tubes F, C, and D:\n• Tube F is [4, 4, 4, 0] (three 4’s plus an empty slot). If we can add a 4 to F, it will be solved.  \n• Tube C is [4, 1, 1, 1]. Its top three balls are 1’s hiding the 4 at the bottom.  \n• Tube D is [1, 0, 0, 0] (with a 1 at the bottom).\n\nA good strategy is to remove the top 1’s from tube C so that we can later use their color to complete another tube. The very first move is to take the top ball of tube C (a 1) and move it onto tube D. This move is legal because tube D’s top ball (its only ball so far) has the same color (1).\n\nSo the move is from tube C to tube D – which we denote with the two letters \"CD.\"\n\nAfter that move, further moves (not detailed here) can eventually lead to one of the tubes being completed (for example, tube F by later adding a 4 from tube C after clearing the overlaying 1’s, or by using tube D’s extra 1’s to achieve four in a row). But the first and immediate move is \"CD.\"\n\nAnswer: CD","We can start by noticing that tubes B and E are already “solved” (each full of 3’s and 2’s respectively), and we need one more tube to be solved with four balls of the same color. One attractive candidate is tube F, which already has three 4’s. However, tube F’s top ball is 4 so to add a 4 there we need a source whose top ball is also 4.\n\nLooking at the remaining tubes, tube C holds balls [4, 1, 1, 0] (with the right‐most position empty). Its top ball is currently 1, so we can’t directly move a ball from C to F. However, notice that tube C’s stack has a “1” on top of another “1” hiding the bottom 4. In order to unearth that 4, we must get rid of the 1’s that are covering it. \n\nOne viable option is to move the top ball (which is 1) from tube C onto tube D (which holds [1, 1, 0, 0]). Since the top of tube D is 1, the move is allowed by the rule (“the ball being moved must ... match the color of the ball at the top of the target tube or the target tube must be empty”). After this move, tube C will have one fewer ball—revealing the next ball on top (which is still 1) and eventually allowing access to the 4 below once both 1’s are relocated. Collating the 1’s into tube D (which already has two 1’s) will eventually complete tube D as a solved tube (with [1,1,1,1]), and later the freed 4 from tube C can then be moved to tube F to finish that color group.\n\nThus, the immediate move that progresses toward solving the puzzle is to move the top ball from tube C (a 1) to tube D (which has a top 1).\n\nAnswer: CD","The optimal move is to take the top ball from tube C (which is a 1) and place it onto tube D. Tube D currently has three 1’s with its top ball being 1, so placing another 1 there will complete it as [1,1,1,1]. With tube B already all 3’s and tube E all 2’s, this move results in three tubes each containing exactly four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: CD","The only move that immediately completes a fourth uniform tube is to move the ball from tube C onto tube F:\n\n• Tube C has one ball (4) at the bottom and the rest empty, so its top ball is 4.\n• Tube F shows [4, 4, 4, 0]. Its top ball is 4 (the highest nonempty ball), so adding a 4 is allowed.\n• After moving the ball, tube F becomes [4, 4, 4, 4] (complete). With tubes B, D, and E already complete, this move achieves the goal (even exceeding it by completing four tubes).\n\nFollowing the required output format, the answer is: \n\nAnswer: CF"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Tube B already is complete with 3’s. One sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n1.

We already have B done (color 3), and we can use one tube for all 1’s and one tube for all 2’s.\n\nA possible sequence of moves is to use D for color 1 and combine the color 2’s in one tube. Here’s one way to do it step‐by‐step:\n\n1. Move the top ball from tube A (which is 1) onto tube D. \n • The move is allowed because tube D’s top ball is 1.\n • Notation: “AD”\n After this move, tube A becomes [2, 2, 0, 0] (only the two 2’s remain), and D becomes [1, 1, 1, 0].\n\n2. Move the top ball from tube C (its top is 1) onto tube D.\n • Again, allowed because D’s top ball is 1.\n • Notation: “CD”\n Now, tube C becomes [2, 2, 0, 0] and D becomes [1, 1, 1, 1] (completed with 1’s).\n\nSo now two tubes are solved: D (1’s) and B (3’s).\n\n3. To complete the third target (color 2), notice that tube A now has two 2’s and tube C has two 2’s. We can consolidate all into one tube. For example, we move the top ball of C onto A.\n • Since A’s top ball is 2 and C’s top ball is 2, the rule is satisfied.\n • Notation: “CA”\n After this move, A becomes [2, 2, 2, 0] (three 2’s) and C becomes [2, 0, 0, 0] (one 2 left).\n\n4. Move the remaining top ball from tube C (which is 2) onto tube A.\n • Again, allowed (destination’s top is 2).\n • Notation: “CA”\n After this, tube A becomes [2, 2, 2, 2] (a complete tube of color 2) and tube C is empty.\n\nNow we have three tubes that are “completed” (filled with one color):\n B: [3, 3, 3, 3]\n D: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n A: [2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nThus the move sequence is: AD, CD, CA, CA\n\nAnswer: AD CD CA CA","Here's one valid solution:\n\n• Move the top ball from A onto D. (A’s top ball is 1 and D’s top is 1, so it’s allowed.)  \n• Move the top ball from C onto D. (C’s top ball is 1 and D’s top is now 1.)  \n• Move the top ball from C onto A. (Now C’s top ball is 2 and A’s top ball is also 2.)  \n• Move the top ball from C onto A.

Notice that tube A is [2,2,1,0] so its top (last) ball is a 1; similarly, tube C’s top ball is 1; and tube D already has two 1’s ([1,1,0,0]). Since a ball may be moved only onto a tube that is empty or whose current top ball matches its own color, we can “fix” the ones and then combine the twos.\n\nOne winning series of moves is as follows:\n1. Move the top ball from A (which is 1) to D (whose top is 1). \n  After this move:\n   A becomes [2,2,0,0] and\n   D becomes [1,1,1,0].\n2.

The other balls come in two colors: color 1 and color 2. There are exactly four ones in total (one in tube A, one in tube C, and two already in tube D), so one good plan is to gather all the 1’s into one tube. In tube D you already have two 1’s; if you add another 1 it will then have three ones and later one more 1 can complete that tube as “solved” (four of the same color). Notice that tube A’s top ball is a 1 (its configuration is [2,2,1,0] so the “1” is on top) and it can be moved on tube D because tube D’s top is also a 1 (its configuration is [1,1,0,0]). Thus, the ideal first move is to take the ball from tube A and put it on tube D. (Later one would move the 1 from tube C onto D to finish the collection of ones.) \n\nSo the move is: from A to D.\n\nAnswer: AD","I'll start by explaining my reasoning.\n\nLooking at the board:\n A: [2, 2, 0, 0]\n B: [3, 3, 3, 3] (complete, all 3’s)\n C: [2, 2, 1, 0]\n D: [1, 1, 1, 0]\n E: [0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWe want three tubes to have four balls of the same color. Tube B is already complete (color 3). Notice that there are exactly four 1’s (three in tube D and one in tube C) and exactly four 2’s (two in tube A and two in tube C). To complete one of these pairs to form a tube of 4 same-colored balls, we can act by moving a ball from one tube to another.\n\nA key legal move is to complete tube D for color 1. In tube D we currently have three 1’s and an empty slot. The top ball of tube C (which is the last ball since the rightmost digit is the top) is a 1. Because the rule allows moving a ball if it matches the top ball of the destination (and tube D’s top ball is 1), we can move that 1 from tube C to tube D.\n\nThis move is represented by the two letters “CD” (moving the top ball from tube C onto tube D).\n\nAnswer: CD","We already have tubes B and D completely solved with all 3’s and 1’s respectively. That means we only need one more tube filled with four 2’s. Both tubes A and C already contain two 2’s. A promising strategy is to start combining the 2’s. A legal move (since the top ball of each tube is a 2) is to pour the top ball from tube C into tube A. After that move tube A would have three consecutive 2’s (with one empty slot remaining) and tube C would have one 2 left. This advances you toward eventually making tube A a complete tube of 2’s. \n\nAnswer: CA","The best move is to take the top ball (a 2) from tube C and pour it into tube A where the top ball is also a 2.

Right now the only moves that are allowed move a top ball from a full tube (A, B, C, or D) onto one of the two empty tubes (E or F). One useful idea is to eventually “uncover” balls so that we can start gathering the four balls of one color together. Notice that tube B contains two 1’s (in its inner positions) but its top ball is a 3 that is in the way. By moving the top ball from tube B onto an empty tube (say tube E), we will reveal a 1 on tube B—and later, that 1 can be used to help form a tube of all 1’s. \n\nThus the move is to take the top ball from tube B and drop it into tube E. \n\nAnswer: BE","I'll start by examining the current situation. Note that each tube has four slots (counted from bottom to top), and a “0” means an empty slot. (Only tubes with fewer than four balls may receive a moved ball.) Also, when moving a ball it must go on top of an already–occupied tube that has the same color on its very top or into an empty tube.\n\nHere’s the board as given:\n\n • A: [3, 2, 4, 3]    (top = 3)\n • B: [4, 1, 1, 0]    (top accessible ball = 1)\n • C: [4, 1, 4, 2]    (top = 2)\n • D: [3, 1, 2, 2]    (top = 2)\n • E: [3, 0, 0, 0]    (one ball: 3 at the bottom, so top = 3)\n • F: [0, 0, 0, 0]    (empty)\n\nNotice that only tubes B, E, and F are not full (B has three balls, E has one, and F is completely empty).\n\nA promising first step is to “free” part of a full tube by moving its top ball into an empty tube (or onto a tube whose top matches). One useful idea is to start gathering a color that already appears several times. For example, color 2 shows up on top of both tube C (2) and tube D (2), and if we eventually want to build a tube of four “2”s we will need to get access to the buried color 2 (currently in tube A). To help prepare for later moves, we want to clear one full tube a bit.\n\nHere’s one move that is legal and useful:\n• Tube D is full and its top ball is a 2. The only acceptable destinations are tubes that aren’t full. Among B, E and F, tube F is empty so it is a legal target.\n• Thus, move the top ball (a “2”) from tube D to tube F.\n\nAfter this move the board would be updated as follows:\n – Tube D becomes [3, 1, 2, 0] (now containing three balls with top = 2).\n – Tube F becomes [2, 0, 0, 0] (with its first ball being 2).\n\nThis “D to F” move is legal (target tube F was empty) and helps by giving room to later combine the “2”s (for example, one might later move the top “2” from tube C onto tube D whose top is 2, further grouping same-colored balls).\n\nIn the required two-letter format (source letter followed by destination letter) this move is denoted:\n\nAnswer: DF","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube D (which is a 2) to tube F. Currently tube D is [3, 1, 2, 0] (three balls with 2 on top), and tube F is [2, 0, 0, 0] (with a 2 already present). Since the ball being moved (2) matches the top ball of tube F (2), the move is legal. This move also frees the ball 1 in tube D so that we can later consolidate the four 1’s (which are exactly four in total) into one tube.\n\nAnswer: DF","I'll start by describing my reasoning briefly and then give the final move.\n\nLooking at the board, one critical step is to get the ball that’s “blocking” a potential group out of Tube C. Currently Tube C is [4, 1, 4, 2] (with the top ball being a 2) and Tube F contains two 2’s ([2, 2, 0, 0]). Since the ball that we want to move is a 2 and the top ball of F is also 2, we can legally move the top ball from Tube C onto Tube F (because the moving ball matches the target’s top color). This move reduces Tube C to three balls ([4, 1, 4]) which will help us later expose the misplaced 1 so that we can eventually gather together the 1’s into one tube. \n\nThus, the move is from Tube C (source) to Tube F (target), which we record simply as \"CF\".\n\nAnswer: CF","I'll examine the board and look for a move that progresses toward having three tubes that end up with four balls of the same color. Here’s one piece of reasoning:\n\n• Tube A currently is [3, 2, 4, 3] (all filled, with the top ball being 3) and tube E is [3, 0, 0, 0] (one ball, a 3, at the bottom). Since the top ball of tube E (its only ball) is 3, we can legally move a ball of color 3 onto it.\n\n• Moving the top ball from tube A (which is 3) onto tube E is allowed because the moving ball (3) matches the color of the ball on top of tube E. After that move, tube A would become [3,2,4,0] (three remaining balls) and tube E would become [3,3,0,0]. This lays groundwork for one of the target tubes (a pure 3‐tube) by gathering same colored balls.\n\nFollowing the rules, the move is indicated by two letters: the first for source, the second for target. In this case, that move is from tube A to tube E.\n\nAnswer: AE","I'll explain my reasoning.\n\nWe have six tubes with four slots each. The tubes contain these balls (from bottom to top):\n\n A: [3, 2, 4, 0]\n B: [4, 1, 1, 0]\n C: [4, 1, 4, 0]\n D: [3, 1, 0, 0]\n E: [3, 3, 0, 0]\n F: [2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nEach nonzero number is a ball of that color. In each tube, the “top ball” is the highest nonzero ball (since empty slots “0” are above the balls).\n\nThe current top balls are:\n A: 4 (from …,4)\n B: 1\n C: 4\n D: 1\n E: 3\n F: 2\n\nOur eventual goal is to achieve three tubes each containing exactly four balls all of the same color. Noticing that tube F nearly meets that goal (it has three 2’s and an empty slot), we’d like to make the fourth ball of color 2 available. In tube A, however, though there is a ball of color 2, it is not on top because the top ball is 4. So if we can move the top ball from tube A, the ball underneath (2) will become available to move into tube F. \n\nIn order to legally move the top ball from a tube, the ball being moved must be placed on a tube that is either empty or has a top ball of the same color. Tube A’s top ball is 4. Tube C also has a top ball 4 (its content being [4, 1, 4, 0]). So moving the ball 4 from tube A onto tube C is legal because the top ball of C is 4. \n\nAfter the move “AC”:\n • Tube A becomes [3, 2, 0, 0] (with top ball 2 now exposed),\n • Tube C becomes [4, 1, 4, 4].\n\nThis move frees up tube A so that its now-top ball (2) can later be moved onto tube F to complete it as a tube of four 2’s. This move therefore helps the overall goal.\n\nThus, the correct move based on the board and rules is to move the top ball from tube A onto tube C.\n\nAnswer: AC","I'll move the top ball (color 2) from tube A onto tube F. This is allowed because the top ball of tube F is also a 2 (and there’s an empty slot), so tube F will become [2,2,2,2] and be one of the three target tubes containing four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: AF","I analyzed the board. Notice that tube F already holds four 2’s and is complete. In order to eventually form two more complete tubes (whether for 1’s, 3’s, or 4’s), it is often useful to free up a tube for later neutral moves or to consolidate a color. One promising idea is to build up the 3’s because three tubes already include a 3 in their ball counts (tube A, tube D, and tube E). In particular, tube E already contains two 3’s (its bottom two balls) and its top ball is 3, so it is a “friendly target” for a 3.\n\nTube A currently holds a single 3 (at its bottom) and three “empty” positions. Its top ball is therefore the 3. By moving the 3 from tube A onto tube E (which already has a top 3), we consolidate the color-3 balls in one tube and at the same time clear tube A entirely (making it an “empty tube” for future moves). (Recall that a move is allowed if the moved ball’s color matches the top ball of the target tube or the target tube is empty.)\n\nThus, move the top ball from tube A (a 3) to tube E, because E’s top ball is 3. The answer move is from A to E.\n\nAnswer: AE","I'll start by identifying the current situation in each tube. For each tube the nonzero entries (from bottom to top) are the balls present:\n\n• Tube A: empty  \n• Tube B: [4, 1, 1] with top ball 1  \n• Tube C: [4, 1, 4, 4] with top ball 4  \n• Tube D: [3, 1] with top ball 1  \n• Tube E: [3, 3, 3] with top ball 3  \n• Tube F: [2, 2, 2, 2] (already a completed tube of 2’s)\n\nWe need eventually three tubes that are “solved” – having four balls all of the same color. Notice that Tube F is already solved, and Tube E has three balls of 3. In order to complete Tube E with four 3’s, we’d like to add another 3 on top. However, Tube D’s bottom ball is 3 but its top ball is 1. If we remove the top ball from Tube D, that 1 is temporarily “blocking” access to its 3. \n\nA valid move requires moving a ball from the top of one tube onto another tube where the ball being moved either matches the top ball of that tube or the tube is empty.  \n• By moving the top ball (which is 1) from Tube D onto Tube B, we make use of the fact that Tube B’s top ball is also 1.  \n• This move is valid since 1 matches 1.  \n• After this move, Tube D will reveal its underlying 3. Although Tube B becomes [4, 1, 1, 1] (still unsolved), the important step is that Tube D becomes [3] only, which will then allow us (in subsequent moves) to move the 3 into Tube E and complete that tube.\n\nThus, the best move under the given rules is to move the top ball from Tube D onto Tube B.\n\nAnswer: DB","The easiest valid move is to take the only ball in tube D (a 3) and move it onto tube E. Tube E’s highest ball is a 3, so the move is allowed. This move will complete tube E as [3,3,3,3], which is one of the three tubes you need with identical balls. \n\nAnswer: DE","Based on a solution‐sequence analysis, one good first move is to remove the top ball from tube C and put it into an empty tube (here we use tube A). In our plan the eventual goal is to “free” the mis‐matched ball so that one of the full tubes (B or C) can be later completed into a uniform tube. (Remember that tubes E and F are already solved.) In our sequence one of the initial steps is therefore to move the 4 that sits on top of tube C onto tube A. This move obeys the rules (because tube A is empty) and starts the process toward obtaining three solved tubes.\n\nAnswer: CA","I analyzed the board and found a complete plan. Notice that tubes E and F are already “solved” (all 3’s and all 2’s). That means we need to complete one more tube with a single color. (There are two candidate colors among the remaining tubes: color 4 and color 1.) In the configuration\n\n A: [4, 0, 0, 0]\n B: [4, 1, 1, 1]\n C: [4, 1, 4, 0]\n D: [0, 0, 0, 0]\n E: [3, 3, 3, 3]\n F: [2, 2, 2, 2]\n\none good solution is to “build” the 4’s into tube A. (There is one 4 already in A; while B and C have additional 4’s that are hidden beneath some 1’s.) Although several moves are needed to free those 4’s and then combine them into a full stack, the very last move of the solution is to drop a 4 onto the 4‐stack in tube A.\n\nFor instance, one complete sequence is:\n 1.

BD – move the next 1 from B onto D (now D shows a 1 on top)\n 5. CD – move a 1 from C onto D (D’s 1 supports another 1)\n 6.

CA – finally, move the last free 4 (from C) onto A. Now tube A becomes [4,4,4,4] (all 4’s)\n\nAt that point you have three solved tubes (A, E, and F). Since the final move is the one that completes a tube of fours, the answer is given by that move.\n\nAnswer: CA","We want to “unlock” one of the unsolved tubes so that we can later complete it with color‐4. Notice that tube A already contains two 4’s ([4, 4, 0, 0]) so it would be best to add two more 4’s there. However, the only other available 4’s are hiding at the bottom of tubes B and C. Both B and C have a 1 at the top (B is [4, 1, 1, 1] and C is [4, 1, 0, 0]), so we must first remove that 1. Tube D is completely empty so it’s an ideal temporary spot. In particular, if we move the top ball from tube C (the 1) into tube D, then tube C becomes [4, 0, 0, 0] with 4 now on top—ready to be moved onto tube A (which already has a top ball 4). This first move is critical in setting up the win.\n\nThus, the move is to move the ball from tube C onto tube D.\n\nAnswer: CD","I recommend moving the top ball from tube B onto tube D. In tube B the top ball is a 1, and tube D’s current top ball is also 1 (since it contains a single 1), so the move is allowed. This move will start shifting the ones out of tube B (which already has a 4 at the bottom) so that you can eventually free up the 4s in tube B to be added to tube A, or complete tube D with ones. With tubes E and F already solved, getting one more tube solved completes the goal. \n\nAnswer: BD","I'll explain my reasoning briefly. We already have two tubes that are already “solved” – tube E (all 3’s) and tube F (all 2’s). That leaves us with color balls 1 and 4 in the other four tubes. Noticing that if we consolidate the two separate groups of 1’s into one tube, we get four 1’s in one tube. In tube B we currently have three balls (from bottom: 4 then 1 then 1) with one accessible top ball (a 1), and tube D has two 1’s. By moving the top ball from tube B (which is 1) onto tube D (which already has 1 at the top), we “add” one more 1 to D (making it [1, 1, 1, 0]). (A subsequent identical move from B onto D would reveal the remaining 1 – note that once that move is made tube D would become [1, 1, 1, 1] and thus solved.) Since the puzzle asks for a two‐letter notation of a move – for example, “DC” would mean moving the top ball from tube D onto tube C – the intended move in our solution is to move from tube B onto tube D.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: BD","We can complete a tube of color 1 by moving the top ball from tube B (which is a 1) onto tube D. Tube D’s top ball is also 1, so placing the ball there will result in tube D having [1, 1, 1, 1], making it a complete tube of one color. Since tubes E and F are already complete (both having four balls of the same color), this move yields three complete tubes in total.\n\nAnswer: BD","We need to gather all four 4’s into one tube. Notice that tubes A, B, and C each have one or more 4’s and the only available color to complete a “solved tube” (four of the same color) is color 4. Tube A already has two 4’s, while tube B and tube C have one each. We can move the top ball from tube B to A since A’s top is a 4 and it isn’t full. After that, tube A will have three 4’s. Next, we move the top ball from tube C to A (again allowed because A’s top is 4 and there is space) to complete four 4’s in tube A. Then we have three tubes solved: tube A (now [4,4,4,4]), along with tubes D, E, and F which were already complete.\n\nSo the moves are:\n• Move from B to A.\n• Move from C to A.\n\nAnswer: BA CA","A good move is to combine the 4 from tube B with the 4’s already in tube A. Tube A currently has two 4’s and tube B has one 4. Since the top ball in tube A is 4 (matching the ball from tube B) and tube A has space, moving the top ball from B onto A is legal. This move creates a tube A with three 4’s, setting up the eventual completion of the four-of-a-kind tube.\n\nAnswer: BA","By moving the top ball of tube C (which is a 4) onto tube A—which currently has a 4 at its top—you can complete tube A to become [4, 4, 4, 4]. After this move, tubes A, D, E, and F will each have four balls of the same color (even though only three solved tubes are required, obtaining an extra solved tube is acceptable). \nAnswer: CA"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Notice that tube D has a pair of 4’s at the bottom but is “spoiled” by its top ball (a 2). Since the ball moved must either match the target’s top or go into an empty tube, using an empty tube to temporarily store the mis‐placed ball is smart. Moving the top ball of tube D (a 2) into an empty tube (say, tube E) is a legal and promising first move. \n\nThus, we choose to move the top ball from D into E.\n\nAnswer: DE","I recommend moving the top ball from tube D to tube F.

Notice that tube D currently is almost complete: [4, 4, 4, 0] needs a 4 on top. The only extra 4 available is inside tube C but it’s blocked by the top ball (a 1). We can clear that by moving the top ball of tube C onto a tube whose top ball is also a 1. Tube A has [1, 3, 1, 0] with its top (the highest nonempty ball) being 1, so the move is allowed. This move is indicated by the two letters “CA” (meaning move the top ball from tube C to tube A). After that move tube C’s top ball becomes 4, which then can be moved (in a subsequent move) onto tube D to complete it. Therefore, the next move is:\n\nAnswer: CA","We notice that tube D contains three 4's and one empty space (configuration: [4, 4, 4, 0]). Tube C, on the other hand, holds three balls (2, 3, 4) with its top ball being a 4 (configuration: [2, 3, 4, 0]). Since our move rule allows us to move a ball to a tube if the ball color matches the top ball of the target tube, moving the top ball (4) from tube C onto tube D is valid. This move fills tube D with four 4’s, giving us one of the three required tubes with four balls of the same color, which is a step toward solving the puzzle.\n\nAnswer: CD","I'll choose to begin by joining the color 3 balls. Notice that tube F already contains a 3, and tube B’s top ball is also a 3. According to the rules, since the top of tube F is 3 (matching the ball from tube B), we may move that ball there. Doing so will help start into forming a tube of four 3’s (recall there are exactly 4 threes on the board).\n\nThus, the move is to take the top ball from tube B and place it on tube F. In our notation, that move is represented with the letters \"BF.\"\n\nAnswer: BF","I'll analyze the board first. We already have tube D completely solved with 4 balls of color 4:\n  D: [4, 4, 4, 4]\n\nNow, we can aim to make another homogeneous tube. Notice the color 3 appears exactly 4 times:\n • In tube F, we have two 3’s: F: [3, 3, 0, 0] (bottom two balls are 3)\n • In tube C, we have a 3 at the top (C: [2, 3, 0, 0])\n • In tube A there is a 3 too, but it isn’t at the top.\nOne straightforward step is to use the accessible 3 from tube C to pour onto tube F. The rules allow moving a ball if it matches the color on the top of the target tube (tube F’s top ball is 3) or if the target is empty.\n\nThus, if we move the top ball from tube C (which is 3) onto tube F, we update:\n • Tube F becomes: [3, 3, 3, 0]  (now three 3’s in tube F)\n • Tube C becomes: [2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis move is represented by two letters: the first letter is the source tube (C) and the second is the target tube (F).\n\nAnswer: CF","Analyzing the board we notice that one of our “completed” tubes is already in place – tube D holds [4,4,4,4] (all 4’s). The only colors that appear exactly four times overall are 2 (a “2‐tube” candidate) and 3 (a “3‐tube” candidate). In tube B we have [2,2,1,0] – so although there are two 2’s at the bottom of B, the stray 1 prevents this tube from being homogeneous. Likewise, tube F already has three 3’s ([3,3,3,0]) so if we can add one more 3 it will be complete.\n\nIt is clear that a temporary “free” tube is needed to correctly sequence moves. One natural idea is to free one tube by moving a ball from a tube that holds just a single ball. That is why we focus on tube C which shows [2,0,0,0]. Although it holds one ball (a 2) it is “stuck” there, and we would prefer it empty so that later moves – whether to offload an extra ball or to expose a ball beneath – can be made freely.\n\nNotice that tube E currently is [2,0,0,0] as well. According to the rules a move is allowed if the ball being moved matches the ball at the top of the target tube (or the tube is empty). In our position the top ball of tube E is 2, and so is the only ball in tube C. Thus, we can legally move the top ball from tube C into tube E. This move (that is, “CE” – meaning “move the top ball from tube C onto tube E”) frees the entire tube C to become empty. Having an empty tube is a critical “helper‐space” to rearrange balls – for example, to later remove the stray 1 from tube B or to access the 3 hidden in tube A.\n\nThis is our first step toward solving the puzzle (which eventually will allow you to complete three tubes composed of a single color). \n\nAnswer: CE","I'll examine the tubes first. Tube D is already “solved” with four 4’s. In looking for another color that can be “completed,” notice that tube E contains two 2’s (with two empty positions) and tube B contains two 2’s at the bottom—but a stray 1 sits on top. If we remove the top ball of tube B (which is 1) onto an empty tube (tube C is entirely empty) then tube B’s top will reveal a 2. Once that happens the 2’s from tube B can later be moved into tube E (whose top ball is 2) to help complete that tube of 2’s.\n\nSo the very first move that helps progress toward our goal is to move the top ball from tube B onto tube C. In our notation (source letter then destination letter) that move is indicated as “BC.”\n\nAnswer: BC","I'll explain my reasoning. We want three tubes with four balls each that are all the same color. Notice that tube D is already complete with four 4′s, so we want to finish a tube of 1′s, one of 2′s, or one of 3′s. Counting the balls, color 1 appears three times in tube A and once in tube C (total 4), color 2 appears two times in tube B and two times in tube E (total 4), and color 3 appears once in tube A and three times in tube F (total 4). One way to help is to “free” the odd ball in tube A. In tube A the balls are [1, 3, 1, 1] (bottom-to-top) so the top ball is 1 but the 3 is hiding inside. To eventually expose and move that unwanted 3, we first need to remove the top ball from A. We can legally move that ball 1 from A onto tube C because tube C already has a 1 on top and isn’t full ([1,0,0,0]). Thus the move from tube A to tube C – denoted “AC” – follows the rules and is a valid first step.\n\nAnswer: AC","Let's analyze the board. We have six tubes:\n\n• Tube A: [1, 3, 1, 0] → Contains three balls: bottom 1, then 3, then 1 on top.\n• Tube B: [2, 2, 0, 0] → Two balls (both 2’s).\n• Tube C: [1, 1, 0, 0] → Two balls (both 1’s).\n• Tube D: [4, 4, 4, 4] → Already complete with four 4’s.\n• Tube E: [2, 2, 0, 0] → Two balls (both 2’s).\n• Tube F: [3, 3, 3, 0] → Three balls (all 3’s).\n\nOne overall goal is to have three tubes completely filled with four balls of the same color. Since Tube D is already solved (all 4’s), we can target the other colors. Notice that the game pieces can be rearranged so that:\n – The four 2’s (found in Tubes B and E) can be combined to solve one tube.\n – The four 3’s (three in Tube F and one in Tube A) can be combined to solve another tube.\n – The four 1’s are in Tubes A and C, but we can concentrate this color later if desired.\n\nLooking closely at Tube A, although it contains one 3 (the middle ball) that we’d like to add to Tube F’s three 3’s, the top ball in Tube A is currently 1. That 1 is “blocking” access to the 3. According to the rules, when moving a ball the target tube’s top must be either empty or of the same color as the ball being moved. \n\nTube C already has balls of color 1 (its top ball is 1). So, we can make the move:\n Move the top ball from Tube A (which is 1) to Tube C.\nThis move is valid because the top ball of Tube C is 1, matching the ball being moved. After doing so, Tube A will reveal its 3 as the new top ball, which then can later be moved to Tube F (whose top ball is 3) to complete that tube of four 3’s.\n\nThus, the next logical move is to move the top ball from Tube A to Tube C.\n\nAnswer: AC","I'll explain my reasoning and then give the series of moves.\n\nWe start with these tubes (from bottom to top; “0” means an empty slot):\n\n A: [1, 3, 0, 0] (two balls: bottom “1” and top “3”)\n B: [2, 2, 0, 0] (two “2”s)\n C: [1, 1, 1, 0] (three “1”s)\n D: [4, 4, 4, 4] (complete with “4”s)\n E: [2, 2, 0, 0] (two “2”s)\n F: [3, 3, 3, 0] (three “3”s)\n\nOur aim is to have 3 tubes that are “solid” (four balls of the same color). Notice that tube D is already complete.\n\nLooking at the other tubes, we spot two opportunities to finish a tube with a single move:\n • Tube F has three “3”s. Its top ball is “3” so if we can place a “3” on it, F will become complete.\n • Tube C has three “1”s, but no accessible “1” on top of another tube (tube A’s “1” is at the bottom).\n • Meanwhile, tubes B and E each contain two “2”s. They can be merged into a complete tube in two moves.\n\nA good plan is therefore:\n\n1. From tube A, the top ball is a “3”. We can move that “3” onto tube F (whose top is “3”), which fills F with four 3’s. (Move: A → F, expressed as “AF”.)\n  After this move:\n   A becomes [1, 0, 0, 0] (only the “1” remains)\n   F becomes [3, 3, 3, 3] (complete)\n\n2. Next, we want to complete one more tube by merging the two “2” piles. Tube B already has two “2”s and its top ball is “2”. So we can move the top “2” from tube E (whose top is “2”) onto B.\n  Move: E → B (expressed as “EB”).\n  After this move:\n   B becomes [2, 2, 2, 0] (now three “2”s)\n   E becomes [2, 0, 0, 0] (only one “2” remains)\n\n3. Now tube B has three “2”s. Its top ball is “2”, and tube E’s remaining ball is “2”, so we can move that onto B.\n  Move: E → B (again “EB”).\n  After this move:\n   B becomes [2, 2, 2, 2] (complete)\n   E becomes [0, 0, 0, 0] (empty)\n\nAt this point we have three complete tubes: D (all 4’s), F (all 3’s), and B (all 2’s).\n\nThus the sequence of moves is: AF, then EB, then EB.\n\nAnswer: AF EB EB","The best move is to take the top ball from tube A (which is a 3) and put it on top of tube F. Tube F already has a top 3, and it has an empty slot, so the move is legal. This move will complete tube F by making it [3, 3, 3, 3]. Now tubes D and F each have four balls of the same color, leaving you one complete tube closer to the goal.\n\nAnswer: AF","I'll examine the board first:\n\n• Tube A: [1, 0, 0, 0] – Contains a single ball (color 1).\n• Tube B: [2, 2, 0, 0] – Contains two balls (color 2).\n• Tube C: [1, 1, 1, 0] – Contains three balls (all color 1).\n• Tube D: [4, 4, 4, 4] – Already complete with four balls (color 4).\n• Tube E: [2, 2, 0, 0] – Contains two balls (color 2).\n• Tube F: [3, 3, 3, 3] – Already complete with four balls (color 3).\n\nThe aim is to have three tubes completely uniform (four balls of the same color). Right now tubes D and F are complete. If we move the top ball from Tube A (which is color 1) to Tube C, the move is valid because the top ball of Tube C is also 1, and Tube C isn’t full. This move will result in:\n\n• Tube C will become [1, 1, 1, 1] (completing the tube with color 1).\n• Tube A will become completely empty.\n\nThis gives us three complete tubes (C, D, and F), which is the goal.\n\nThus, the move is indicated by the two letters “AC” – meaning move the top ball from Tube A to Tube C.\n\nAnswer: AC","The board already has three tubes that are “solved” (all four balls of one color in tubes C, D, and F). However, to make a legal move without disturbing those complete tubes you can move the top ball from one of the unsolved tubes (B or E) to the empty tube A. For instance, moving the top ball (a 2) from tube B to tube A is a valid move because tube A is empty. \n\nAnswer: BA","One tube with color 2 is spread across tubes A (with one 2), B (with one 2) and E (with two 2’s). Since tubes C, D, and F are already filled with one uniform color each, the goal is essentially to consolidate the 2’s into one tube. One immediately valid move is to move the top ball from tube A (a 2) onto tube B because the top ball of tube B is also a 2. This results in tube B having two 2’s while tube A becomes empty, which helps in the consolidation process.\n\nAnswer: AB","We start by reviewing the board. Tubes C, D, and F each already contain four balls and they’re all the same color (all 1’s in C, all 4’s in D, and all 3’s in F), so the goal of having three tubes with four uniform balls is already reached. However, according to the rules we still need to indicate one legal move.\n\nOne legal move is to take the top ball from tube E. Tube E’s representation is [2, 2, 0, 0] so its top non‐zero ball is a 2. It can be moved to any empty tube. Tube A ([0, 0, 0, 0]) is completely empty so moving the ball there is allowed.\n\nThus, we indicate the move by writing two letters:\n• The first letter, E, means “move from tube E.”\n• The second letter, A, means “move the ball onto tube A.”\n\nThis move “EA” is legal under the rules (the target tube A is empty) and does not disturb our already completed tubes.\n\nAnswer: EA","We first note that the board already has three tubes completely “solved” (each full of a single color): Tube C has all 1’s, Tube D has all 4’s, and Tube F has all 3’s. In many of these puzzles the goal is to have exactly three tubes completely filled with balls that are all the same color. (The remaining tubes are used as “holding” tubes.) Since Tubes C, D, and F already meet that condition the goal is already achieved, and one might be tempted to say “no move is needed.”\n\nHowever, the puzzle instructions require us to output a move using two letters (the first indicating the “from‐tube” and the second the “to‐tube”). One natural “dummy” move that does not disturb the solved tubes is to work with the unsolved tubes. (Here Tubes A, B, and E contain the color “2” balls – one in A, two in B, and one in E. They already add up to four 2’s but are scattered over three tubes.) \n\nA standard first step is to consolidate them. For example, we can move the top ball from Tube A (which is a 2) onto the top of Tube B (whose top is also a 2). That move is legal because the ball being moved (color 2) matches the number at the top of tube B, and it does not touch any of the already solved tubes. (After that move, Tube A becomes empty and Tube B will have three color‑2 balls. Later one could move from Tube E to Tube B to “complete” that tube as a solved tube—but since the goal requires three solved tubes and Tubes C, D, and F are already solved, one valid move is simply A → B.)\n\nFollowing the required response format, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: AB","The optimal move is to take the top ball from tube E and move it onto tube B. Here's why:\n• Tube E initially has [2, 0, 0, 0] (with the only ball, a 2, being at the bottom but as the sole ball it is also the top ball).\n• Tube B initially has [2, 2, 2, 0] with three 2’s and an empty space at the top.\n• Moving the 2 from tube E to tube B is allowed because the top ball of tube B is a 2 (which matches the moved ball) and there is enough space.\n• After this move, tube B becomes [2, 2, 2, 2]—a completed tube of four balls of the same color, meaning that in addition to the already complete tubes C ([1,1,1,1]), D ([4,4,4,4]), and F ([3,3,3,3]), there’s a fourth completed tube.\nThus, the move is denoted by the letters \"E\" (source) and \"B\" (destination).\n\nAnswer: EB"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

One promising idea is to eventually group the 5’s because there are exactly four 5’s (two are in A and two in B). In both A and B there are extra balls blocking the 5’s. In tube B the top ball is a 4 (with the underlying balls being 1, then 5, then 5). Therefore, if we remove that top 4 from tube B by moving it into one of the empty tubes (F or G), we reveal a 5.

Thus, moving the top ball from tube A onto tube F is a legal move that contributes toward eventually forming a homogeneous tube (in this case, potentially a tube of color 4).\n\nAnswer: AF","I examined the board and noticed that in tube D the top ball is 2 and in tube A the top existing ball is also 2. Since you can only place a ball onto a tube whose top ball is the same color (or onto an empty tube), moving the top ball from tube D to tube A is allowed. \n\nThus, the move is from tube D to tube A.\n\nAnswer: DA","Let's look at the board. Every color appears exactly four times. Our aim is to have three tubes filled with four balls of the same color. Notice that color 4 appears four times in total:\n• Tube C has a 4 (in the middle),\n• Tube D has a 4 on top,\n• Tube F already holds two 4’s.\n\nIf we choose to consolidate all the 4’s into tube F, then tube F (which currently is [4, 4, 0, 0] with top ball 4) is a good candidate for completion. We can move the top ball from tube D (which is 4, since tube D is [3, 1, 4, 0] with 4 on top) onto tube F. The target rule is met because the top ball of F is already 4, matching the ball being moved.\n\nThus, the move is from tube D to tube F.\n\nAnswer: DF","I'll begin by examining the board. Currently we have:\n\n A: [5, 2, 2, 0] ⇒ balls: 5 (bottom), then 2, then 2 on top  \n B: [1, 5, 5, 0] ⇒ balls: 1, then 5, then 5 on top  \n C: [1, 4, 1, 3] ⇒ full tube; top ball is 3  \n D: [3, 1, 0, 0] ⇒ balls: 3, then 1 on top  \n E: [2, 2, 3, 3] ⇒ full tube; top ball is 3  \n F: [4, 4, 4, 0] ⇒ balls: 4, then 4, then 4 on top  \n G: [5, 0, 0, 0] ⇒ ball: 5 alone\n\nOur objective is to eventually create three tubes that each hold four balls of the same color. Notice that there are exactly four occurrences each of colors 2, 3, 4, and 5 (while 1 occurs only three times). It thus makes sense to aim at completing a tube for one of these colors. One good strategy is to free up an entire tube so that we can use it as temporary storage during the regrouping process.\n\nLook at tube G. It contains only a single ball (color 5) and moving that ball onto another tube of matching color would leave tube G empty. Tube B already has top ball 5 (its stack is [1, 5, 5…] with one free space) so placing G’s ball there is allowed by the rule (the moving ball’s color must match the top ball of the target tube, or the target must be empty). Moving the ball from G onto B turns tube B into [1, 5, 5, 5] (with four balls now) and importantly empties tube G. An empty tube is a very useful “helper” tube when later moves require a destination that is empty. This move also begins to group the color 5 balls.\n\nFollowing the problem’s instructions (using two letters where the first letter is the source tube and the second is the destination tube), the move is indicated by “GB” – moving the top ball from tube G onto the top of tube B.\n\nAnswer: GB","I examined the board and found that one promising strategy is to prepare for completing tube F as a uniform stack of 4’s. Tube F already has three 4’s ([4,4,4,0]) so if we can bring in one more 4 the tube will be solved. Looking at tube C – currently [1,4,1,3] – its top ball is 3 and it’s “blocking” the 4 underneath. Although our final plan is to use that 4 from tube C, we must first reveal it. The rule requires that the ball moved must either land on an empty tube or on a tube whose top ball is of the same color. Tube G is completely empty so the legal move is to remove the top ball (3) from tube C and put it in tube G.\n\nThus the move is from tube C to tube G – write that as “CG”.\n\nAnswer: CG","Analyzing the board, one promising plan is to complete tube F (which already has three 4’s) by supplying it with one more 4. However, no tube’s top ball is immediately a 4. But notice that tube C is [1, 4, 1, 0] with the top ball being 1. If we first remove that top 1 from tube C and place it on a tube whose top is also 1 (thus legal), then tube C’s new top becomes 4. In the current configuration, tube D is [3, 1, 0, 0] with top ball 1, so moving the top 1 from tube C to tube D is allowed. This move (from C to D) sets up the possibility in a future move to move the uncovered 4 from tube C onto tube F to finally complete the tube of 4’s.\n\nThus the next move is from tube C to tube D.\n\nAnswer: CD","I'll start by checking a promising move. Notice that tube F contains three 4’s (its state is [4, 4, 4, 0]), and by adding one more 4 we can “solve” it (i.e. have four 4’s). Looking at tube C, its top ball is 4 (tube C’s state is [1, 4, 0, 0]). The rule allows moving a ball onto a tube if the moving ball’s color matches the current top ball of the destination tube which here is 4. Thus, moving the top ball from tube C (which is 4) to tube F is valid. This move results in tube F becoming [4, 4, 4, 4] – one complete solved tube.\n\nSo my recommended move is to move from tube C to tube F.\n\nAnswer: CF","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube D onto tube C. In tube D the top ball is 1, and tube C’s current top ball is also 1 (its only ball). This move is valid (because the moving ball’s color matches the top ball in the destination), and it helps start grouping the four 1’s into one tube, which is one of the targets toward getting three homogeneous tubes.\n\nAnswer: DC","I'll analyze the board. We have seven tubes:\n• A: [5, 2, 2, 0] → three balls (5 at the bottom, then 2 and 2) with one free space.\n• B: [1, 5, 5, 5] → four balls (from bottom to top: 1 then 5, 5, 5).\n• C: [1, 1, 0, 0] → two balls (both 1’s at bottom positions) and two free spaces.\n• D: [3, 1, 0, 0] → two balls (3 then 1) with two free spaces.\n• E: [2, 2, 3, 3] → four balls (2, 2 at the bottom then 3, 3 on top).\n• F: [4, 4, 4, 4] → four balls all 4 (already complete).\n• G: [3, 0, 0, 0] → one ball (3) then three free spaces.\n\nNotice that overall each color appears exactly four times:\n – Color 1: one in B, two in C, one in D.\n – Color 2: two in A, two in E.\n – Color 3: one in D, two in E, one in G.\n – Color 4: four in F.\n – Color 5: one in A, three in B.\n\nOur goal is to make three tubes end up “solved” (each having four balls of the same color). Tube F (all 4’s) is already complete. For example, one promising plan is to complete a tube with color 1 by gathering all ones into one tube and likewise use another tube for color 3 or color 5 later.\n\nA good move is to start consolidating the ones. Look at tube D: it has a top ball 1 (even though its bottom is a 3, that 3 cannot be moved until it’s exposed, so it’s best not to add more 1’s on D). Tube C, on the other hand, has two 1’s (with its top ball being 1) and contains free spaces. According to the rules the moved ball must match the destination’s top ball (or move into an empty tube). So moving the top ball from tube D (a 1) onto tube C (whose top is 1) is legal and will help consolidate the color 1 group.\n\nThus the move is: move from tube D to tube C.\n\nAnswer: DC","Here’s one winning solution. Notice that our goal is to obtain three “solved” tubes (all‐four balls identical) and we already have F solved (all 4’s). One way is to use the two “helper” tubes D and G to complete a tube of 3’s and use tube E to form a tube of 2’s. For example, starting with\n\n A: [5,2,2,0]  B: [1,5,5,5]  C: [1,1,1,0]  \n D: [3,0,0,0]  E: [2,2,3,3]  F: [4,4,4,4]  \n G: [3,0,0,0]\n\none winning sequence is as follows:\n\n1. Move the top ball from tube E to tube D.  \n  • In E the top ball is a 3 and D’s top (with its only ball, a 3) matches – so move E → D.  \n  After this, D becomes [3,3,0,0] and E becomes [2,2,3,0].  \n\n2. Move the new top ball from tube E to tube G.  \n  • Now the top of E (a 3) can be placed on G (which has a 3) – so move E → G.  \n  After this, G becomes [3,3,0,0] and E becomes [2,2,0,0].  \n\n3. Use tube E (which now has two 2’s) to build a tube of 2’s by pouring from tube A.  \n  • Tube A’s top ball is 2; since E’s top is 2, move A → E.  \n  After this, A becomes [5,2,0,0] and E becomes [2,2,2,0].  \n\n4. Again, move the remaining top 2 from tube A onto E.  \n  • With A’s top still being 2 and E’s top 2, move A → E.  \n  After this move, tube A is left with just [5,0,0,0] and E becomes [2,2,2,2] (solved).  \n\n5. Now combine the two tubes having 3’s. Use tube D as the destination by moving from G.  \n  • Tube G’s top ball (3) can go onto D (whose top is 3) – so move G → D.  \n  After this, G becomes [3,0,0,0] and D becomes [3,3,3,0].  \n\n6. Finally, move the last 3 from tube G into D.  \n  • With G’s top ball 3 and D’s top 3, move G → D.  \n  Now D becomes [3,3,3,3] (solved) and G becomes empty ([0,0,0,0]).  \n\nAt the end we have three tubes solved:  \n • E: [2,2,2,2]  • D: [3,3,3,3]  • F: [4,4,4,4]\n\nThe six moves in the required two‐letter notation are: \n ED, EG, AE, AE, GD, GD\n\nAnswer: ED EG AE AE GD GD","I'll look for a move that helps build one of the complete four‐ball towers. Right now tube F is already solved (all 4’s). A promising strategy is to form a tower of 3’s. Notice that tubes D and G each have a 3 as their only ball and tube E contains two 3’s at the top. If we move the top ball from tube E (a 3) onto tube D (whose top ball is also 3), this move is legal and helps accumulate 3’s in one tube. (Recall that the ball being moved must either match the color of the ball at the target tube’s top or that tube must be empty.) \n\nSo I choose to move from tube E to tube D.\n\nAnswer: ED","We can win this level by focusing on creating two more completed tubes (joining the already‐completed Tube F of 4’s). Notice that Tubes D, E, and G hold all of the 3’s. In particular, Tube D currently has two 3’s, and both Tube E (its top ball is 3) and Tube G (which holds a 3) can supply the remaining two 3’s if they are moved one‐by‐one onto Tube D. In view of the rules – that you may only move a ball if it matches the color on the top of the target tube (or if the target tube is empty) – it is natural to start by “stacking” 3’s.\n\nFrom the initial board we have:\n A: [5, 2, 2, 0] → (Top ball = 2)\n B: [1, 5, 5, 5] → (Top ball = 5)\n C: [1, 1, 1, 0] → (Top ball = 1) (almost a complete tube of 1’s)\n D: [3, 3, 0, 0] → (Top ball = 3)\n E: [2, 2, 3, 0] → (Top ball = 3)\n F: [4, 4, 4, 4] → (already complete with 4’s)\n G: [3, 0, 0, 0] → (Top ball = 3)\n\nA winning strategy is to finish completing Tube D as the 3‐tube. To start that process we can move the top ball from Tube G (a 3) onto Tube D (whose top is 3, a legal move).\n\nThus, the move to kick off the winning strategy is to move from Tube G onto Tube D – represented by the two letters “GD.”\n\nAnswer: GD","The best move is to take the top ball from tube E (which is a 3) and place it on tube D. Tube D already has three 3’s and its top ball is 3 so this move is allowed and completes tube D with four 3’s. This gets us one more tube solved (with F already solved) and moves the board closer to having three uniform tubes.\n\nAnswer: ED","We can work step‐by‐step. Notice that three tubes are already “completed” with uniform colors: tube D is full of 3’s and tube F is full of 4’s. That means if we can complete one more tube the goal is reached. Tube C already has three 1’s ([1, 1, 1, 0]) so if we add one more “1” on top it becomes [1, 1, 1, 1]—a completed tube.\n\nHowever, when we examine the tubes, the only tube that eventually contains a “1” is tube B ([1, 5, 5, 5]), but its top is currently a 5. In order to reveal the “1” (at the bottom), we must first remove the three 5’s from the top of tube B.\n\nThe available move is to start moving the 5’s from tube B. Look at the rules: When moving a ball, the target tube must either be empty or have on top a ball of the same color. The top ball in tube B is 5 and many other tubes do not have 5 on top. However, tube G is completely empty ([0, 0, 0, 0]) so moving a 5 there is allowed.\n\nThus the first move is to take the top ball (5) from tube B and put it on tube G. This move is indicated by “BG” (meaning from tube B to tube G).\n\nOnce that and two similar moves are done, tube B’s top ball will eventually be “1” and that ball can then be moved onto tube C to complete it. But since you only need to provide a two‐letter answer for one move, the correct next move to start the solution is:\n\nAnswer: BG","We note that tubes D and F are already solved (all 3’s and all 4’s). If we look at tube E it currently holds two 2’s (bottom to top: [2,2,0,0]). Tube A holds a 5 at the bottom and two 2’s above it ([5,2,2,0]) with its top ball being a 2. By moving the top 2 from tube A into tube E (which already has a 2 at the top), we add a ball of matching color to tube E. (Note that a ball may be moved only if it matches the color of the target tube’s top ball or if the target is empty.) While tube E will then have three 2’s (i.e. [2,2,2,0]) and still isn’t solved yet, this move is a valid step along a winning sequence – the idea is that you can later move the remaining 2 from tube A into tube E to complete that tube with four 2’s. Once tube E is complete, three tubes (D, E, and F) will each have four balls of the same color.\n\nThus, the move we want is to take the top ball from tube A and move it to tube E.\n\nAnswer: AE","I'll analyze the board:\n• Tube D already contains [3, 3, 3, 3] (all 3’s) and tube F has [4, 4, 4, 4] (all 4’s). So they are solved.\n• Looking at tube E, it has [2, 2, 2, 0] (three 2’s). If we can add a ball “2” on its top, it will become [2, 2, 2, 2].\n• The ball on the top of tube A is “2” (tube A is [5, 2, 0, 0]). Since tube E’s top is “2”, we can legally move the “2” from A to E.\nAfter this move, tubes D, F, and E will each be homogenous with four balls of the same color.\n\nThus, the move is from tube A to tube E.\n\nAnswer: AE","I'll explain my reasoning. We already have three tubes that are completely solved – tube D with [3,3,3,3], tube E with [2,2,2,2], and tube F with [4,4,4,4]. That means the goal is achieved with tubes having four balls of the same color. To avoid disturbing any of these, I looked toward the unsolved tubes (A, B, C, and G). They contain:\n\n• Tube A: [5, 0, 0, 0]   → one ball: 5  \n• Tube B: [1, 5, 5, 0]   → top ball: 5  \n• Tube C: [1, 1, 1, 0]   → top ball: 1  \n• Tube G: [5, 0, 0, 0]   → one ball: 5  \n\nA legal move requires that the ball being moved (the top ball of the source tube) matches the top ball of the target tube or that the target tube is empty. Since tubes A, B, and G have 5 on top, we can safely move a ball with the color 5 among them. I chose to move the top ball from tube A (which is 5) onto tube G, whose top ball is also 5. This move is legal, and it leaves tube A empty while tube G now has two 5’s. (This move does not affect the already solved tubes D, E, and F.)\n\nThus, the two-letter move is \"AG\".\n\nAnswer: AG","We can see that tubes D, E, and F already hold four balls each (all 3’s, 2’s, and 4’s respectively). That means the win condition—having three tubes each with four balls of the same color—is already met. However, if we wish to “make a move” without disturbing the solved tubes, one clever option is to work with the unsolved tubes to eventually group the remaining color (5’s and 1’s) later on.\n\nLooking at tubes B and G:\n• Tube B contains [1, 5, 5, 0] so its top (rightmost nonzero) ball is a 5.\n• Tube G shows [5, 5, 0, 0] so its top ball is also 5.\nAccording to the rules a ball may be placed on a tube if its top ball has the same color (or if the tube is empty). Thus, moving the 5 from tube B onto tube G (which already has a 5 at its top) is a legal move. \n\nAfter this move:\n– Tube B will become [1, 5, 0, 0] so then its top ball becomes the remaining 5.\n– Tube G will become [5, 5, 5, 0] building toward eventually forming a full tube of 5’s.\nMeanwhile, tubes D, E, and F remain untouched (thus keeping the win condition intact).\n\nIn the requested two‐letter format, the move from tube B onto tube G is represented as “BG.”\n\nAnswer: BG","The optimal move is to take the top ball from tube B (which is a 5) and place it on tube G. Tube G currently has a top ball of 5, so this move is valid and it completes tube G as [5, 5, 5, 5], making it a solved tube.\n\nAnswer: BG","The key is to complete a tube of color 1 by combining the 1 from tube B with the three 1’s already in tube C. Since tube C’s current top ball is 1 (the last nonempty ball) and tube B’s ball is also 1, it’s a legal move to pour from tube B into tube C.

An easy way to do that is to move the top ball (a‑4) somewhere legal.\n\nTube E is completely empty so it’s a valid target. Moving the 4 from tube A to tube E is allowed (an empty tube accepts any ball) and will reveal a 3 on tube A’s top.

Since one legal move is to pour a ball onto a tube whose current top (if not empty) is the same color, we can move the top ball from Tube C (a 4) onto Tube E.

Meanwhile, the extra 1 in tube C can later be used with the remaining 1’s to form a uniform tube (using the 1 from the bottom of tube D and the 1 from tube B if needed). Also, with tube F already having three 2’s, we know that once we free the 2 in tube A (currently blocked by 3), we can finish that color’s tube.\n\nThus, the move from B to C is a valid step toward achieving the final configuration of three tubes each filled with four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: BC","Let’s look at the board step‐by‐step. The tubes have exactly four of each color overall (colors 1, 2, 3, and 4). For example, tube E already has three 4’s ([4,4,4,0]) so if you can add one more 4 on top, E will become a completed tube (four 4’s). In tube B the only ball is a 4 ([4,0,0,0]), and since the rule allows moving a ball onto a tube when the target’s top color matches (or the target is empty), moving the top ball from B onto E is a legal move. That move would transform E into [4,4,4,4] while emptying B.\n\nThis is an optimal starting move to work toward having three tubes with four balls of the same color. (Later moves could complete the remaining colors, but the puzzle asks for a move indicated by two letters.) \n\nAnswer: BE","One valid move is to take the top ball from tube D (a 3) and place it onto tube A. Tube A’s top ball is 3, so the rule that the moved ball must match the target’s top ball is satisfied. This move helps step toward freeing the 1 at the bottom of tube D so that tube C (with three 1’s) can eventually be completed with a 1, while leaving tube F (with three 2’s) and tube E (already all 4’s) in good standing. \n\nAnswer: DA","I'll choose to start by moving the top ball from tube A to tube D. Here’s the reasoning:\n\n• Tube A currently is [2, 3, 3, 0] (with 3 as its top ball) and tube D is [1, 3, 3, 0] (with top ball 3). Since the ball from A (a 3) matches the top ball of D, this move is legal.\n• After moving, tube A becomes [2, 3, 0, 0] (exposing its 2 at the bottom to be freed eventually) and tube D becomes [1, 3, 3, 3].\n• This helps our overall plan. Tube E is already solved ([4, 4, 4, 4]). Tube C ([1, 1, 1, 0]) and tube F ([2, 2, 2, 0]) are nearly complete. By first aggregating the 3’s in tube D, we can later “clear” tube D (by moving its top three 3’s to an empty tube) to reveal the 1 at the bottom and then use tube C’s 1’s to form a complete tube. In parallel, by eventually exposing the 2 in tube A we can help complete tube F.\n• Thus, taking move “AD” sets up the sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle.\n\nAnswer: AD","We want to expose the lone “1” at the bottom of tube D so that it can later join the three “1”s already in tube C to complete that tube. One good first move is to take the top ball from tube D (which is a 3) and move it into an empty tube (tube B). That is legal (the target is empty) and begins our progress.\n\nAnswer: DB","I analyzed the position and looked for a move that helps work toward ending up with three tubes completely “solved” (each filled with four balls of one color). Notice that tube E is already finished (all 4′s) and that two tubes are “almost” done: tube C with three 1′s and tube F with three 2′s. However, no ball of 1 or 2 is immediately available on top of any tube because tube A (which holds a 2 at its very bottom) is “blocked” by a 3 on top. Therefore the idea is to free up that 2 so that it may later be used to top up a tube of 2’s (namely, tube F).\n\nA good candidate is to move the top ball of tube A (a 3) onto another tube that already shows 3 on its top. Tube D has three balls ([1,3,3]) so its top is a 3, and by placing the 3 from A onto D you get a valid play (since the moving ball’s color equals the target’s top color). After that move tube A is left with just the bottom ball [2] (revealing the 2) and tube D becomes [1,3,3,3]. Although tube D is not yet “solved” because of the stray 1 at its bottom, the move “AD” successfully liberates the 2 from tube A so that a subsequent move could top up tube F (which already has three 2’s) to form a complete tube of 2’s. (Tube E is already complete and tube C, with three 1’s, is also nearly complete if a 1 were available.) \n\nThus, according to this plan the best first move is to transfer the top ball from tube A to tube D.\n\nAnswer: AD","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube F onto tube A. In tube A we already have a 2 at the bottom, and tube F’s top ball is also 2, so this move is legal. This move is a step toward completing tube A as [2, 2, 2, 2]. With tube E already complete ([4, 4, 4, 4]) and later combining the 3’s from tubes B and D to form a full tube of 3’s, we would have three tubes (A, B, and E) each with four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: FA","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube F to tube A. In detail, tube A already contains two 2’s and an empty space on top, while tube F’s top ball is also a 2. Since the rule allows moving a ball onto an empty tube or onto a ball of the same color, this move is allowed. (Later moves could be used to combine the remaining 2’s so that one tube reaches “four 2’s” and, together with tube E which is already complete, and with another tube eventually completed, you’d meet the goal of three tubes each with four balls of the same color.) \n\nAnswer: FA","I analyzed the tubes and noticed that tube E is already “solved” with four 4’s. Of the remaining tubes one is nearly complete: tube A has three 2’s ([2, 2, 2, 0]) and tube F holds a 2 at the top ([2, 0, 0, 0]). By moving the top ball from tube F (which is a 2) onto tube A (whose top ball is 2), tube A becomes [2, 2, 2, 2]—a complete, homogeneous tube. This move is legal since the ball being moved (a 2) matches the top ball of tube A. (Later moves – for example, using moves from tube D to tube B and then from tube D to tube C – can be used to complete one more tube, but the immediate winning move to help solve the puzzle is to complete tube A.)\n\nThus the move is represented by the two letters “FA” (meaning: move the top ball from tube F to tube A).\n\nAnswer: FA","We can complete the puzzle by “completing” the group of 3’s into one tube. Notice that tubes A and E are already complete (all 2’s and all 4’s), so we only need one more tube that is filled with balls of a single color. Observe that tube B already holds one ball of color 3 and tube D holds three 3’s (on top of a stray 1 at the bottom). If we remove the top three balls (all color 3) from tube D and move them onto tube B (which already has a 3 so the move is legal because the moving ball matches the top of tube B), then tube B will become [3, 3, 3, 3] (from bottom up), and we then have three complete tubes (A, B, and E).\n\nHere is the move‐by‐move plan:\n\n1. Move the top ball from tube D (which is 3) onto tube B (whose top ball is 3). (Move “DB”)\n  After this move:\n   • Tube D becomes [1, 3, 3, 0]\n   • Tube B becomes [3, 3, 0, 0]\n\n2. Again, move the top ball from tube D (now the top ball is 3) onto tube B (top is 3). (Another “DB”)\n  After this move:\n   • Tube D becomes [1, 3, 0, 0]\n   • Tube B becomes [3, 3, 3, 0]\n\n3. One more time, move the top ball from tube D (the top is 3) onto tube B (top is 3). (Third “DB”)\n  After this move:\n   • Tube D is left with [1, 3, 0, 0] (it no longer matters)\n   • Tube B becomes [3, 3, 3, 3] (complete)\n\nNow the three tubes A, B, and E are complete with four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: DBDBDB","I'll begin by analyzing the board. We have:\n\n• Tube A: [2, 2, 2, 2] – already four 2’s.\n• Tube E: [4, 4, 4, 4] – already four 4’s.\n• Tube B: [3, 0, 0, 0] – a 3 at the bottom.\n• Tube C: [1, 1, 1, 0] – three 1’s waiting for one more 1.\n• Tube D: [1, 3, 3, 3] – its top three balls are 3’s, with a 1 at the bottom.\n• Tube F: [0, 0, 0, 0] – empty.\n\nOur goal is to make three tubes each contain four balls of the same color. One good strategy is to complete Tube B with 3’s and\/or complete Tube C with 1’s.\n\nNotice that Tube D holds three 3’s at the top. If we remove all three of them from D and move them onto Tube B (which already has a 3 at the bottom), then Tube B will become [3,3,3,3] (a complete tube of 3’s). After that, the only ball left in Tube D will be the bottom 1. We can then pipe that 1 onto Tube C (whose top ball is 1) to make it [1,1,1,1] if needed. (Even if we already have three complete tubes – e.g., A, E, and B – our moves show a valid sequence.)\n\nThe very first move in such a sequence is to move the top 3 from Tube D onto Tube B. (This is legal because Tube B already has a 3 at the top.) In move notation (source then target), that is “DB.”\n\nTherefore, one valid move according to the rules and our plan is to move the top ball from Tube D to Tube B.\n\nAnswer: DB","We can notice that tubes A ([2,2,2,2]) and E ([4,4,4,4]) are already “solved” (each has four balls of the same color). This means that if we can get one more tube solved then the goal is met.\n\nTube B currently has [3,3,0,0] (two balls) and needs two more 3’s, while tube C has [1,1,1,0] (three 1’s) and just needs one more 1. However, looking at the board the only tube that contains extra balls that might help is tube D ([1,3,3,0]). Although its bottom ball is 1, its top ball is a 3. (Remember that only the “top ball” may be moved—that is, the rightmost nonzero digit.) \n\nNotice that if we move the top ball of tube D (a 3) onto tube B, the rules are followed (because tube B’s top nonempty ball is 3). Then tube D will become [1,3,0,0] (with 3 as its top remaining ball) and tube B will become [3,3,3,0]. Although tube B will then still have 3 balls, it is “set up” so that on a subsequent move you can move the remaining 3 from tube D into tube B to complete it as [3,3,3,3]. \n\nSince the game’s move notation is two letters indicating “from” and “to” (for example, DC means “move the top ball from tube D onto tube C”), our best first move is to move from tube D to tube B. This step is the critical move toward eventually creating three solved tubes (tube A, tube E, and, with one more move, tube B).\n\nAnswer: DB","The key observation is that two tubes are already complete – tube A with all 2’s and tube E with all 4’s. To finish a third completed tube (a tube with 4 balls of the same color), we note that tube B already contains three 3’s. Therefore, if we can add one more ball of color 3 onto tube B, it will become complete.\n\nLooking at the board, tube D has two balls [1,3,0,0] (ignoring empty spaces). Its top (last) non‑empty ball is 3. Since the rule permits moving a ball onto a tube whose current top matches the ball’s color (or if the tube is empty), moving the top ball from tube D (color 3) to tube B (whose top is 3) is a valid move.\n\nThis move will complete tube B as [3,3,3,3].\n\nAnswer: DB","The board shows that tubes A, B, and E are already solved (each contains four balls of one color).

For example, note that tube F has [6,6,5,4] with top ball 4, and tube G already has a 4 (its only ball, [4,0,0,0]). Because the rule requires that the ball being moved must either match the top ball of the target or the target be empty, moving the top ball 4 from F to G is allowed (4 matches 4). This move will start gathering color 4 balls together toward eventually forming one tube with all four balls of color 4, one of our three goal tubes.\n\nAnswer: FG","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube D onto tube H. In tube D the top ball is a 3 and tube H’s current top (and only) ball is also a 3. This move is legal and helps start grouping the 3’s. (Once more moves are made the plan will be to eventually form one four‐ball tube for the four 3’s; note that in this level the total amount of 3’s is exactly four when you count the one hidden in tube B.) \n\nAnswer: DH","I'll analyze the board briefly. (Recall that each tube is ordered from bottom (first element) to top (last element) and a “0” means an empty slot. Also, if a tube isn’t completely empty, you may only move a ball into it if its current top ball has the same color as the ball you’re moving.)\n\nLooking at the counts among colors, one set of four occurs for color 3:\n• Tube B ([6, 3, 1, 0]) contains a 3 (second ball from the bottom), though its top ball is 1.\n• Tube D ([4, 3, 0, 0]) contains a 3 on top.\n• Tube H ([3, 3, 0, 0]) already contains two 3’s.\n\nMany puzzles are solved by consolidating one color into a single tube. Here, color 3 appears exactly four times. Tube H (with two 3’s) is a promising candidate if we “add” one more 3 at a time, provided we have a matching top.\n\nNotice that tube D’s top ball is 3. Its move is legal provided the target tube’s top ball is 3. Tube H’s top ball is 3 (since its content is [3, 3] with two empties above).

Since a move is legal if the ball being moved matches the color on top of the destination tube, moving the 4 from D to G is allowed. This move will turn tube D completely empty and give tube G three 4’s—a step toward having a tube with four matching balls (and eventually using the extra 4 from tube A). Thus, the move from tube D to tube G (written as “DG”) is our chosen step.\n\nAnswer: DG","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube A to tube D. That move takes the 1 from tube A (which is full with [4, 5, 6, 1]) and places it on an empty tube D. This is a standard “unlocking” move in these puzzles because it frees up tube A so that further moves (in later steps) can eventually reveal and combine like‐colored balls. In the current configuration, tubes G ([4,4,4]) and H ([3,3,3]) are “almost solved” (each nearly filled with a single color) so that they only need one more matching ball to complete a homogeneous stack of four. Moving a ball from A to D is a good step toward unblocking further moves that will eventually lead to three tubes (for example, completing the 4’s in tube G, the 3’s in tube H and one more color that totals 4) being homogeneous.\n\nThus, according to the rules, I give the answer as “AD.”\n\nAnswer: AD","I'll analyze the board first.\n\nCurrent tubes (bottom to top; 0 means an empty slot):\n• A: [4, 5, 6, 0] → has three balls (4 at bottom, then 5, then 6 on top)\n• B: [6, 3, 1, 0] → three balls (top is 1)\n• C: [2, 2, 1, 1] → full (four balls)\n• D: [1, 0, 0, 0] → one ball (1 at the bottom, top is 1)\n• E: [2, 2, 5, 5] → full\n• F: [6, 6, 5, 0] → three balls (top is 5)\n• G: [4, 4, 4, 0] → three balls (top is 4)\n• H: [3, 3, 3, 0] → three balls (top is 3)\n\nOur goal is to eventually have three tubes each filled with four balls of the same color. Inspecting the board, note that there are four “1”s (one in tube B on top, two in tube C, and one in tube D). These are good candidates to form one homogeneous tube.\n\nA promising first move is to start consolidating the 1’s. Tube D already has a 1 at the bottom. Its top ball is 1, so we can legally place another 1 there from a tube whose top ball is also 1. Tube B’s top ball is 1. According to the rules, we can move the top ball from tube B (which is 1) onto the top of tube D (since D’s top is 1).\n\nThus, the move is to take the top ball from tube B and put it onto tube D.\n\nAnswer: BD","I'll choose to complete tube H, which already contains three 3’s. Tube B’s top ball is a 3 (its configuration is [6, 3, 0, 0]) so moving that 3 onto tube H (which is [3, 3, 3, 0]) is allowed because the top ball of H is 3. This move will fill tube H with four 3’s, achieving one of the three required uniform tubes.\n\nAnswer: BH","I propose moving the top ball from tube C onto tube D. In tube C the top ball is a 1 and in tube D the top ball is also a 1 (with two 1’s already at the bottom) so this move is allowed.

Notice that Tube H is already complete with all 3’s. Also, Tube D contains three 1’s and has an empty space for one more ball. Looking at Tube C, its top ball is a 1, and the rule allows a move provided the ball moved matches the current top ball of the target tube (or if the target tube is empty). Since Tube D’s top ball is 1, we can move the top ball (which is 1) from Tube C onto Tube D.\n\nThis move “from C to D” turns Tube D into [1, 1, 1, 1]—a uniform tube of 1’s. That gives us Tube H (all 3’s) and Tube D (all 1’s). We’d then only need one more completed uniform tube and further moves would be planned; however, the task here asks for the next move in the format of two letters.\n\nSo the next move is: move the 1 from Tube C onto Tube D.\n\nAnswer: CD","We can solve the puzzle by creating a third tube of four identical balls. Notice that tubes D and H already hold four 1’s and four 3’s, respectively. One attractive candidate for our third uniform tube is tube G (which currently holds three 4’s: its balls are [4,4,4,0]). To finish tube G we need to add one more 4 on top. In order to place a 4 on G the moved ball must be a 4. Although tube G already has 4’s, no tube shows a 4 at its immediate top (the “top ball” is the last nonzero entry). However, we can “uncover” a 4 from tube A by a short sequence.\n\nCurrently, tube A is [4,5,6,0] (so its top ball is 6). If we first move that 6 from A onto tube B (which is [6,0,0,0] with a 6 at its bottom), the rule is satisfied because the moved ball (6) matches the top ball on B. That first move (A→B) will change tube A to [4,5,0,0] (with 5 now as its top ball) and tube B to [6,6,0,0]. Now tube A’s top is 5; by moving that 5 (say, onto tube F which already has a 5 as its top) we’d reveal the 4 at the bottom of A. Finally, moving that 4 from A onto tube G completes tube G as [4,4,4,4] and gives us three solved tubes (D, G, and H).\n\nSince the move notation requires two letters (source followed by target), we can report the very first move in the solution sequence.\nThus, the next move should be to move the top ball from tube A onto tube B.\n\nAnswer: AB","We can win this level by “completing” a third tube. Note that from the start tubes D and H already hold four balls of a single color (all 1’s and all 3’s, respectively). That means if we can finish any other tube with a single move‐series, we’ll meet the goal.\n\nLook at tube G. It currently holds [4, 4, 4, 0] (so three 4’s) and needs a 4 on top. The only 4 available is “buried” in tube A. (Tube A is shown as [4, 5, 0, 0] so its top ball is the 5; the 4 is at the bottom.) Therefore our plan is to free the 4 in tube A and then move it onto tube G.\n\nStep 1. Remove the top ball from A. (That is a 5.) We must move it into a tube that already shows a 5 or is empty. Tube F is [6, 6, 5, 0] (with 5 as its top) and has room. So we move the 5 from A to F. That move is indicated by “AF” (i.e. from tube A to tube F). After this move:\n  • Tube A becomes [4, 0, 0, 0] (only the 4 remains) \n  • Tube F becomes [6, 6, 5, 5] (now full).\n\nStep 2. Now tube A’s top ball is the 4 you need. Because tube G’s top is 4, it’s legal to move a 4 onto G. So now move the top ball from A onto G. That move is denoted “AG”. After this move tube G becomes [4, 4, 4, 4] (completed).\n\nAt this point we have three tubes with four balls of a single color:\n  • Tube D: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n  • Tube H: [3, 3, 3, 3]\n  • Tube G: [4, 4, 4, 4]\n\nThus the winning sequence is to move first “AF” then “AG”.\n\nAnswer: AF AG","I'll start by explaining the idea. Notice that tubes D and H are already “complete” (all ones in D and all threes in H). That means we only have to “fix” one more tube so that it becomes a homogeneous tube of four balls. One promising candidate is tube B, which already has two 6‑balls, and tube F has two 6‑balls at its bottom. However, in tube F the top ball is a 5 (its configuration is [6,6,5,0]), and we must remove that “blocking” 5 to expose the 6. We can do that because the ball from F (a 5) can legally move to tube A since tube A’s top ball is also a 5 (its configuration is [4,5,0,0]). \n\nThus, by moving the top ball from tube F to tube A (a move represented as “F→A” or simply “FA”), we “uncover” a 6 in tube F. This simple move is the first step toward eventually stacking four 6’s together in tube B (by later moving the 6’s from F into B).\n\nFollowing the rules, the appropriate two‐letter move that we’re indicating is “FA”.\n\nAnswer: FA","I'll analyze the board. We already have two completed tubes: tube D is [1,1,1,1] (all ones) and tube H is [3,3,3,3] (all threes). We need one more tube that comes to a “solved” state—that is, it must eventually contain four balls all of the same color. Notice that the sixes are split between tubes B and F:\n • Tube B: [6,6,0,0]\n • Tube F: [6,6,0,0]\nThey hold a total of four 6’s. By combining these two stacks, one of them can eventually become filled with 6’s. With their current arrangement, a good next move is to start uniting the sixes. For example, moving the top ball (a 6) from tube F onto tube B (which already has a top 6) is legal and moves toward completing a tube of 6’s.\n\nThus, the recommended move is from tube F onto tube B.\n\nAnswer: FB","The board already has two completed tubes – D with all 1’s and H with all 3’s. Tube B already holds three 6’s ([6, 6, 6, 0]). By moving the 6 from tube F (which has [6, 0, 0, 0]) onto tube B, you complete tube B as [6, 6, 6, 6] (since the moved ball is 6, which matches the top ball in B). This gives you three completed tubes as required. \n\nAnswer: FB","I'll start by analyzing the board. We have eight tubes (A–H) with four slots each (from bottom to top):\n\n A: [4, 5, 5, 0] → two balls (a 4 at the bottom then two 5’s)\n B: [6, 6, 6, 6] → full tube of 6’s (already solved)\n C: [2, 2, 0, 0] → two 2’s\n D: [1, 1, 1, 1] → full tube of 1’s (already solved)\n E: [2, 2, 5, 5] → two 2’s at the bottom and two 5’s on top (mixed)\n F: [0, 0, 0, 0] → empty\n G: [4, 4, 4, 0] → three 4’s\n H: [3, 3, 3, 3] → full tube of 3’s (already solved)\n\nSince our goal is to have three tubes that each contain exactly four balls (all of the same color), we note that B, D, and H are already “solved.” However, there is still work to be done among the unsolved tubes (A, C, E, and G) to free up moves or begin to organize the remaining colors. \n\nA handy first move is to use an empty tube to free up a tube that’s “capped” by the wrong color. Look at tube E. Its top two balls are 5’s, hiding the two 2’s below. If our plan is to eventually complete a tube of 2’s (for instance, by combining with tube C which already has two 2’s), we need to expose the 2’s in E. One way to do that is to move the top ball from E to an empty tube. We can move a 5 from E to tube F (which is empty, and the rule permits moving onto an empty tube). \n\nThis move (from tube E to tube F) is legal because the target (F) is empty. It starts the process of “unlocking” tube E so that its two 2’s can later be moved and combined with the two 2’s already in tube C to form a solved tube.\n\nThus, the move is from tube E to tube F.\n\nAnswer: EF","I looked over the board and noticed that one promising strategy is to “free” the only 4 that is hiding in tube A so that it can later be moved to tube G (which already has three 4’s). Here’s the idea:\n\n• Tube A is [4, 5, 5, 0] so its top ball is a 5 that is “covering” the bottom 4.\n• Tube F is [5, 0, 0, 0] whose top (and only) ball is a 5.\n• By moving the top 5 from tube A onto tube F, we obey the rule (because F’s top is 5) and we begin a two‐move sequence to clear tube A.\n• (After additional moves not shown, once both 5’s from tube A are removed, the remaining 4 in A can be moved to tube G which is [4,4,4,0] to complete that tube.)\n\nSince the rules ask for a move specified by two letters (the first letter is the tube from which you move the top ball, and the second that where you deposit it) a good initial move is from A to F.\n\nAnswer: AF","We'll analyze the board. Note that tubes B, D, and H are already “solved” – they each contain four balls of a single color (B: 6, D: 1, and H: 3). In our rules the goal is to have three tubes each with four balls all the same color.\n\nOne safe move is to take the top ball from tube A and move it to tube F. (Tube A shows [4, 5, 0, 0] with “5” at the top and tube F shows [5, 5, 0, 0] whose top ball is “5”. Because the moved ball’s color (5) matches F’s top ball, the move is allowed.) After this move the board becomes:\n\n A: [4, 0, 0, 0] (top ball now is “4”)  \n B: [6, 6, 6, 6] (solved)  \n C: [2, 2, 0, 0]  \n D: [1, 1, 1, 1] (solved)  \n E: [2, 2, 5, 0]  \n F: [5, 5, 5, 0]  \n G: [4, 4, 4, 0]  \n H: [3, 3, 3, 3] (solved)\n\nNotice that tubes B, D, and H remain solved – the goal is achieved (three tubes each contain exactly four balls of the same color). (In future moves one might continue working on the other tubes, but according to the puzzle our task was to give a move producing a valid state.)\n\nThus the correct move is to move from A to F.\n\nAnswer: AF","I'll analyze the board first. We already see tubed B ([6,6,6,6]), D ([1,1,1,1]), and H ([3,3,3,3]) are each filled with four balls of the same color, which fulfill our goal. However, we can still make a legal move that completes an additional uniform tube without disturbing the solved ones. Notice tube G currently has [4,4,4,0] with its top ball being a 4. Tube A contains [4,0,0,0] with its only ball (a 4) at the top. Therefore, we can legally move the top ball from tube A to tube G because the top ball on tube G is 4 (matching the ball being moved). This move will fill tube G to become [4,4,4,4] – a completed uniform column.\n\nFollowing the rules, we indicate the move with two letters: the first being the source tube and the second the target tube.\n\nAnswer: AG","The move I recommend is to move the top ball of tube E (which is a 5) onto tube F.

One promising idea was to improve the collection of color 1. Right now tube B is [2, 2, 5, 1] (its top ball is 1) and tube F is [1, 0, 0, 0] (its single ball is 1). Since the rule allows moving a ball onto a tube whose top ball is the same color (or onto an empty tube), moving the 1 from tube B onto tube F is legal. This would make tube B become [2, 2, 5] and tube F become [1, 1, 0, 0] (with the two 1’s stacked together, which is progress toward making one of the uniform tubes). \n\nBased on the rules and this reasoning, the move is to take the top ball from tube B and place it on tube F.\n\nAnswer: BF","We note that tube B currently contains [2, 2, 5, 0] (with 0 indicating an empty slot), so its top ball is 5.

One legal move is to take the 5 from tube B and put it into an empty tube. Tube G is completely empty ([0, 0, 0, 0]) so it accepts any ball. Therefore, the move from tube B to tube G is legal and a good step toward our goal.\n\nAnswer: BG","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube A onto tube G. The top ball in tube A is 5, and tube G already contains a 5 (with lots of free space remaining). This move is legal because the ball being moved (a 5) matches the color at the top of the target tube (also a 5), and it begins consolidating the 5’s into a single tube—a step toward filling three tubes with uniform colors.\n\nAnswer: AG","One legal move is to take the top ball of tube C. Its top ball is 2, and tube B’s top ball is also 2. Since tube B isn’t full (it currently holds two balls), you can move the 2 from C onto B.

Currently, tube E is [1, 4, 2, 3] (full, with top ball 3) and tube C is [4, 1, 3, 0] (3 balls, with a top ball 3). Since the moved ball (3) matches the top ball in tube C, the move is legal. After this move, tube E becomes [1, 4, 2, 0] with 2 as its new top ball; later you could use that 2 to complete tube B (which is [2, 2, 2, 0]) into a full tube of 2’s. This move thus helps toward the final goal: to eventually have three tubes each containing exactly four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: EC","I'll analyze the board first.

Also, tube E has a 2 on top. Since the rules allow moving a ball onto a tube that is empty or whose top ball is the same color as the ball being moved, we can move the top ball from E (which is 2) onto B (whose top ball is 2). This move is valid and completes tube B with four 2’s, meeting part of the goal.\n\nSo my move is to move from tube E to tube B.\n\nAnswer: EB","I'll start by checking the board and available top balls. For example, notice tube B is already solved (four 2’s). We need two more tubes to be “completed” (four balls of the same color). One promising target is color 1 because exactly four 1’s appear in total—\n• Tube F has two 1’s (it’s [1, 1, 0, 0]) \n• Tube E holds a 1 at the bottom (its configuration is [1, 4, 0, 0]) \n• Tube C contains one 1 (in the second position, though its top is 3 so we can’t move that 1 directly)\n\nHowever, tube E’s top ball is 4 (its configuration is [1, 4, 0, 0]). If we can remove the top 4 from tube E, the 1 will then be at the top and available to move where needed. One valid move is to move the top ball from tube E onto a tube that already has a 4. In our board tube D is [5, 3, 4, 0] with its top ball as 4. Since the moving ball (4 from E) matches the top ball of tube D, this move is legal.\n\nThus, moving the top ball from tube E to tube D (represented by “ED”) is a valid move that helps progress toward eventually forming a tube with four 1’s.\n\nAnswer: ED","I looked over the board and the legal moves. The only immediate move that lets you combine two tubes that share the same top‐ball color is to move the top ball from tube C—whose top ball is 3—onto tube A, whose top ball is also 3 (and tube A isn’t full, having only three balls). This move is legal under the rule that the ball being moved must match the color at the top of the destination tube (or the tube is empty).\n\nAfter performing this move, tube A becomes [5, 4, 3, 3] (from bottom to top) and tube C becomes [4, 1, 3, 0] (with its top now cleared). This is a good step toward the overall goal.\n\nAnswer: CA","I'll start by checking the tubes’ current top balls and capacities, then list a couple of valid moves before choosing one.\n\n• Tube A: [5, 4, 3, 3] → top ball = 3 (full)\n• Tube B: [2, 2, 2, 2] → already complete (cannot change)\n• Tube C: [4, 1, 3, 0] → 3 balls (top ball = 3)\n• Tube D: [5, 3, 4, 4] → 4 balls (full)\n• Tube E: [1, 0, 0, 0] → 1 ball (top ball = 1)\n• Tube F: [1, 1, 0, 0] → 2 balls (top ball = 1)\n• Tube G: [5, 5, 0, 0] → 2 balls (top ball = 5)\n\nValid moves must have the moved ball match the top ball of the target tube (or the target is completely empty). Among several possibilities, one straightforward, legal move is:\n\n• Move the top ball (which is 1) from Tube E to Tube F. In Tube F the top ball is 1 and it isn’t full (only 2 balls), so this move obeys the rules. The result will be:\n  – Tube E becomes empty.\n  – Tube F’s new configuration becomes [1, 1, 1, 0].\n\nThis move starts building a tube that could be completed soon with four 1’s—a step toward having three tubes (in addition to the already-complete tube B) each with four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: EF","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube A onto tube C. Currently, tube A is [5,4,3,3] with top ball 3 and tube C is [4,1,3,0] (which means it holds three balls – 4 at the bottom, then 1, then 3 – and a free slot at the top). Since the top ball in tube C is the last nonzero ball (3), it matches the ball from tube A. Therefore, this is a legal move. This move also helps free up tube A for further manipulation toward forming a uniform tube in later moves.\n\nAnswer: AC","We first note that tube E is completely empty so any top ball can be moved there. Looking at the board, tube D is full ([5, 3, 4, 4]) with the top ball 4; moving that ball is legal (since the target is empty) and can help free up tube D for future consolidation of colors. Consequently, we choose to move the top ball from tube D onto tube E.\n\nAnswer: DE","I examined the board and noted that tube B is already solved (all 2’s). To work toward having three tubes that are “complete” (four balls of the same color), one promising strategy is to start gathering the 4’s. Notice that tube E already has a 4 at the bottom and is nearly empty, and tube D’s top ball is 4. Since the rule requires that the moved (top) ball either matches the top ball of the target tube or the target tube is empty, moving the top ball (4) from tube D onto tube E (whose top ball is also 4) is a legal move. \n\nPerforming move D → E will update the tubes as follows:\n• Tube D, which originally is [5, 3, 4, 0] (meaning three balls: 5, 3, 4), will lose its top 4 and become [5, 3, 0, 0].\n• Tube E, which originally is [4, 0, 0, 0] (one ball: 4), will have the 4 from D added on top, becoming [4, 4, 0, 0].\n\nThis move brings you closer to the overall goal of having three tubes each with four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: DE","I analyzed the board and found a way to eventually finish three tubes as single‐color tubes. One key idea is to clear tube C to eventually reveal its “1” so that we can add it to the three “1”s already in tube F. Since tube C’s top ball is a 3 and tube D already has a 3 at its top (and enough room), a good first move is to move that 3 from C to D.\n\nThus, the move is to take the top ball from tube C and put it on tube D.\n\nAnswer: CD","We can solve this puzzle in several stages. One acceptable solution is to eventually “finish” one tube by creating a full uniform stack – and then you’ll have three solved tubes. For example, one valid solution process is as follows (each arrow means “move the top ball from … onto …”):\n\n1. Notice that tube B already is solved (2,2,2,2). Then plan to complete tubes F and E.\n2. In tube F the balls are [1,1,1,0] so it needs a ball of color 1. Meanwhile tube C is [4,1,3,0] so its top ball (3) blocks access to that lone 1 deeper in.\n3. To free that 1 we first remove the top 3 from tube C. (A legal move is to pour the top 3 from C onto another tube whose top is also 3 – for example, tube D is [5,3,3,0] so can accept a 3.)\n4. After that (and using a couple of “helper” moves with an empty tube made by first moving aside a ball from tube A), we eventually can pour the now‐exposed 1 from C onto tube F so that F becomes [1,1,1,1] (solved).\n5. Then, by a similar idea, the only remaining “blocking” ball in tube C is a 4. Its removal lets you pour that 4 into tube E (which already has [4,4,4,0]) to complete it as [4,4,4,4] (solved).\n\nThus, after these moves – with tubes B, F, and E solved – you’ve reached the goal of having three tubes each containing four balls of the same color.\n\nIn our solution the very last (winning) move was to move the top ball (a 4) from tube C onto tube E. (Because E’s top is a 4, that move is legal and it fills tube E to four 4’s.)\n\nFollowing the required answer‐format, one acceptable answer is:\n\nAnswer: CE","I'll start by examining the board. Notice that tube B is already complete (it contains [2, 2, 2, 2]). We need two more tubes to be “solid” (four balls of the same color). One promising candidate is tube F which contains three 1’s: [1, 1, 1, 0]. To complete it we need an extra 1. Currently tube F’s top is 1, but no other tube has a 1 immediately on top. However, if we look at tube C (which is [4, 1, 3, 0]), its accessible top ball is 3. If we can move that 3 onto another tube with a matching top – for instance, tube A whose top ball is also 3 (from [5, 4, 3, 0]) – then tube C will reveal its next ball (which is 1). That 1 can later be moved to tube F so that tube F becomes [1, 1, 1, 1] (complete). \n\nThus the immediate move is to remove the top ball (3) from tube C and place it on top of tube A. In game notation this move is indicated by the two letters \"CA\" (meaning \"move from C to A\").\n\nAnswer: CA","We start by noticing that only tube B is “solved” (it contains four 2’s), and the ball‐distributions show that each color appears exactly four times overall. (All four 1’s, 3’s, 4’s, and 5’s are “scattered” among the tubes.) One promising “one‐move–ahead” tactic is to complete one of the nearly “homogeneous” tubes. For example, look at tube F. It currently reads\n  F: [1, 1, 1, 0]\n—that is, three 1’s. If you can add one more ball of color 1 onto F, then tube F will become [1, 1, 1, 1] and be solved.\n\nNow, which tubes have a top ball that is 1 (so that we can legally stack it on top of F’s 1)? Look at tube C which is\n  C: [4, 1, 0, 0]\nIts top nonzero ball is 1. Since F’s top is also 1 (and even though F is not full because its top slot is empty), the rules let you move the top ball from C onto F.\n\nThus the move “CF” (take the top ball from tube C and put it on tube F) is legal. After that move the situation becomes:\n\n  A: [5, 4, 3, 3]\n  B: [2, 2, 2, 2]  (solved)\n  C: [4, 0, 0, 0]  (note: now just a single 4 remains)\n  D: [5, 3, 3, 0]\n  E: [4, 4, 0, 0]\n  F: [1, 1, 1, 1]  (solved)\n  G: [5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nNow tubes B and F are solved and you’re on your way to eventually getting a third tube solved with additional moves (by similarly consolidating one of the other colors into a tube). For the purpose of this “move‐suggestion” puzzle the best immediate move is “CF.”\n\nAnswer: CF","I'll choose to make a move that consolidates one of the nearly‐complete color groups. Notice that tubes C and E both have a 4 at the accessible level. Tube C currently has a single 4 (with three empty slots), and tube E contains two 4’s (followed by two empty slots). If we move the top ball from C (a 4) onto E, where the top is also 4, then tube E becomes three 4’s and tube C becomes completely empty. Having an empty tube can be very useful for future moves (for example, it can later help us expose or relocate the ball in tube A that hides the extra 4 needed to form a complete four‐of‐a‐kind tube). \n\nThus, the move is to take the top ball from tube C and place it on tube E.\n\nAnswer: CE","We want to finish with three “uniform” tubes. Notice that tubes B and F are already complete (B has 2222 and F has 1111). So we aim to complete a third tube. Tube E already has three 4’s (E: [4,4,4,0]); if we can add one more 4 there then it would become [4,4,4,4] and be uniform. Unfortunately, no tube has a 4 on top at the moment. (A, for example, is [5,4,3,3] with top = 3.) The trick is to “uncover” that 4 in tube A.\n\nA good plan is to free tube A by removing its top ball. Using an empty tube is best so as not to interfere with other nearly‐finished tubes. Tube C is completely empty ([0,0,0,0]) so we can move a ball there regardless of its color.\n\nThus, move the top ball of A (which is a 3) into tube C. This move (denoted “AC”) is legal because the target tube is empty. It begins the process of exposing the 4 in tube A so that in a later move you can transfer that 4 into tube E (which already has three 4’s), making E uniform and achieving the goal (along with tubes B and F).\n\nAnswer: AC","I'll analyze the board. Notice that tubes B and F are already “complete” with all balls of the same color (all 2’s and all 1’s). Also tube E has three 4’s and one empty space; if we could add another 4 there it would be finished. But the only extra 4 is in tube A (its second ball). Although it isn’t available immediately, we can free it up.\n\nRight now tube A is [5, 4, 3, 0] (bottom‐up) so its top (removable) ball is 3. To expose the 4 in tube A, we can remove the top 3 from A. We must move it following the rule: the ball being moved must either match the color of the top ball of the target tube or the target tube must be empty. Tube C is [3, 0, 0, 0] so its only ball (at the bottom) is 3. That makes its “virtual” top ball 3, which matches the ball from A. Thus, moving the top ball from A (3) into tube C is allowed. Then tube A becomes [5, 4, 0, 0] (with 4 now on top) so that in a subsequent move, that 4 can be moved onto tube E (which already has three 4’s) to complete it.\n\nSo the move is from tube A to tube C. In the required notation with two letters (source then target) we write: AC\n\nAnswer: AC","I'll analyze the board first:\n\nTube A: [5, 4, 0, 0] → two balls (bottom=5 and top=4)\nTube B: [2, 2, 2, 2] → already four 2’s (solved tube)\nTube C: [3, 3, 0, 0] → two balls (both 3’s)\nTube D: [5, 3, 3, 0] → three balls (bottom=5 then two 3’s)\nTube E: [4, 4, 4, 0] → three balls (all 4’s)\nTube F: [1, 1, 1, 1] → already four 1’s (solved tube)\nTube G: [5, 5, 0, 0] → two balls (both 5’s)\n\nOur goal is to have three tubes filled with four balls of the same color. Tubes B and F already meet this goal. Tube E has three 4’s, and if we can add one more 4 on top, it will become a solved tube. \n\nLooking at Tube A, its top ball is a 4, and moving that ball onto Tube E is legal because the target tube’s top ball is also 4. So by moving the top ball from Tube A to Tube E, Tube E becomes [4, 4, 4, 4] (four 4’s) which is solved.\n\nThus, the move is to take the top ball from Tube A and put it on Tube E.\n\nAnswer: AE","We start by noticing that tubes B, E, and F are already “solved” – each contains four balls of the same color (2, 4, and 1 respectively). Although the other tubes aren’t uniform yet, the objective only requires that three tubes be complete with one uniform color. Since tubes B, E, and F already meet that goal, the board is technically solved. (In many ball‐sort puzzles the aim is to get all tubes uniform, but here the goal is only to have three solved tubes.)\n\nNonetheless, we’re asked to supply one valid move (using two letters) and one that does not disturb the already “solved” tubes. One simple valid move is to move the top ball from tube D to tube C. Here’s the reasoning:\n\n• Tube D is currently [5, 3, 3, 0] so its top (highest nonzero) ball is a 3.\n• Tube C is [3, 3, 0, 0] so its top ball is 3 as well.\n• Under the rule that you can only place a ball onto a tube if that ball matches the color on the top (or if the tube is empty), moving the 3 from D to C is allowed.\n\nAfter this move:\n – Tube D becomes [5, 3, 0, 0].\n – Tube C becomes [3, 3, 3, 0].\n\nThe solved tubes (B, E, and F) remain unchanged; hence the goal of having three tubes each with four balls of the same color is still met.\n\nAnswer: DC","I'll move the top ball from tube D (which is 3) onto tube C, whose top is also a 3. That completes tube C as [3,3,3,3] (four balls of the same color) and brings us closer to having three solved tubes. \n\nAnswer: DC","I'll start by analyzing the board. The tubes are labeled A–G with four slots each (list order from bottom to top). The current status is:\n\n • A: [5, 0, 0, 0] (one ball: 5 at the bottom, which is also the top ball)\n • B: [2, 2, 2, 2] (four balls—all 2’s)\n • C: [3, 3, 3, 3] (four balls—all 3’s)\n • D: [5, 0, 0, 0] (one ball: 5)\n • E: [4, 4, 4, 4] (four balls—all 4’s)\n • F: [1, 1, 1, 1] (four balls—all 1’s)\n • G: [5, 5, 0, 0] (two balls: both 5’s)\n\nThe unsorted color is 5. In total the 5’s are distributed as: one in tube A, one in tube D, and two in tube G (1 + 1 + 2 = 4). Our goal is to eventually have exactly three tubes each filled with four balls of the same color. (In many of these puzzles the end state is that every filled tube is uniform; here there is a twist that only three tubes are required to be “solved.”) \n\nIt makes sense to combine all the 5’s together into one tube to get a “solved” tube for color 5. Right now tube G already has two 5’s, and its top ball is a 5. Both tubes A and D also have a 5 on top. Either of these can be moved to tube G since the ball being moved (color 5) matches the top ball of tube G. \n\nOne good move is to move the top ball of tube D (a 5) onto tube G. This is allowed by the rule (“ball being moved must either match the color on top of the target or the target is empty”) because tube G’s top ball is 5. After this move, tube G will become [5, 5, 5, 0] (three 5’s) and tube D will be empty. This consolidates the 5’s nicely while also creating an extra empty tube for potential further moves.\n\nThus, the answer is to move the ball from tube D to tube G.\n\nAnswer: DG","The only move that makes progress toward a completely homogeneous tube is to move the ball from tube A onto tube G. Tube A’s top (and only) ball is a 5, and tube G already has three 5’s with one empty space. Since the rules allow a ball to be moved if it matches the top color of the destination or if that tube is empty, we can legally transfer the 5 from A to G. After the move, tube G becomes [5, 5, 5, 5], a complete tube of four 5’s, which is one of the three target tubes.\n\nAnswer: AG"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Note that—with six full tubes (A–F) and two empties (G and H)—any move must use one of the empty tubes as the destination. One promising idea is to begin building a tube of color 2. Currently, tube A is [4, 1, 5, 2] with 2 at the very top, and the other 2’s lie buried in tubes B, C, and D. If we can extract the top 2 from A and place it into an empty tube (say, G), then later we can try to gather the other 2’s onto tube G to eventually form a homogenous tube of color 2.\n\nThus, we move the top ball (2) from tube A to the empty tube G. This move is legal because the destination tube G is empty.\n\nSo the move is represented by the letters “AG” (A for the source, G for the destination).\n\nAnswer: AG","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube A onto tube H. In tube A the top ball is a 5 (since A is [4, 1, 5, 0], meaning 4 is at the bottom, then 1, then 5 on top and an empty space at the top slot). Tube H is completely empty, so the move is legal under the rule that the target tube must be empty (or match the moving ball’s color if not empty).\n\nThus, the move “AH” (moving the top ball from tube A to tube H) is a valid choice.\n\nAnswer: AH","I'll analyze the board briefly. First, I list the top (last non‐zero) ball of each tube:\n• A: [4, 1, 0, 0]  → top = 1  \n• B: [2, 3, 6, 6]  → top = 6  \n• C: [3, 2, 1, 6]  → top = 6  \n• D: [1, 5, 2, 5]  → top = 5  \n• E: [3, 6, 4, 5]  → top = 5  \n• F: [3, 1, 4, 4]  → top = 4  \n• G: [2, 0, 0, 0]  → top = 2  \n• H: [5, 0, 0, 0]  → top = 5  \n\nOur ultimate aim is to eventually have three tubes “solved” (each with four balls of one color). One good strategy is to start building one of these target tubes by consolidating the balls of that color. Notice that color 5 appears four times in total (in tubes D, E, and H) and—importantly—the top balls in D, E, and H are all 5 and the tube H is only partially filled. \n\nA legal move requires that when moving a ball, the destination tube is either completely empty or its top ball has the same color as the moved ball. Because tube D’s top ball is 5 and tube H’s top ball is 5 (with room to add more balls), we can move the top ball of D onto H. \n\nThis move (indicated as “DH”) follows the rule (5 onto 5) and begins the process of gathering all 5’s in one tube (H), one of the likely steps toward having a solved tube.\n\nAnswer: DH","We can start by setting up a move that helps free up a needed ball. Notice that tube D currently holds [1, 5, 2, 0] (with its top ball being 2), and tube G holds [2, 0, 0, 0] (with its only ball being 2). Since the ball being moved must match the top ball color of the target tube (or if the target is empty), we can move the top ball (2) from D onto the top of G. This move (“DG”) is legal because tube G’s top ball is 2, and it isn’t full.\n\nAfter move “DG”:\n• Tube D becomes [1, 5, 0, 0] (with 5 now being its top ball), which will help in grouping the 5’s.\n• Tube G becomes [2, 2, 0, 0] (stacking two 2’s).\n\nThis maneuver contributes to our eventual goal of forming three tubes each containing four balls of the same color (by clearing the way to access and group the 5’s, as there are exactly four 5’s among the tubes). \n\nAnswer: DG","Here’s my reasoning: \n\nWe have eight tubes labeled A–H. The rule is that when moving the top ball from one tube, the ball must be placed on top of either an empty tube or a tube whose top ball is of the same color. Our long‐term goal is to end up with three tubes that are completely “solved” (four balls of the same color in each). In the current board a promising move is to work on one of the partially completed tubes that already shows some same-color balls. Notice that tube H contains two 5’s (it is [5, 5, 0, 0] with its top ball being 5) and tube D is [1, 5, 0, 0] with its top ball also equal to 5. Since the rules allow you to add a ball onto a tube if its top ball matches the moving ball’s color, moving the 5 from tube D (its top ball) onto tube H (whose top ball is 5) is allowed. \n\nMaking move “DH” would remove the top 5 from tube D (leaving it with just [1, 0, 0, 0]) and add that 5 on top of tube H. Then tube H becomes [5, 5, 5, 0]. This maneuver is one part of the strategy toward eventually forming one of the three required solved tubes (the tube that eventually contains four 5’s). \n\nAnswer: DH","I'll explain my thinking briefly. Notice that tube H already has three 5’s ([5,5,5,0]). Since a move is only allowed if the ball you add is the same color as the top ball of the target (or the target is empty), the simplest starting move is to complete tube H. In tube E the top ball is 5 (since tube E is [3,6,4,5] with the right‐most digit being the top), so you can move that 5 onto tube H because its top is also 5. After doing so tube H becomes [5,5,5,5]—one solved tube (four balls all of color 5).\n\nThere remains work to form two more homogeneous tubes, but based on the puzzle’s instructions which require you to propose a move by “two letters” (e.g. “DC”), the answer move we give is the one that makes immediate progress. (One well–chosen move is often the first step in a solution.)\n\nThus the move is to move the top ball from tube E onto tube H.\n\nAnswer: EH","We can start by “freeing” a tube that holds one of the balls we want to group. Notice that the only four‐of-a-kind possibility is color 4 (since the only four 4’s are scattered in tubes A, E, and F). In tube A the bottom ball is a 4 but it’s covered by a 1. By moving that top 1 from tube A onto a tube that already has a 1 (namely tube D, whose only ball is a 1), we expose the 4 in A so that later it can receive additional 4’s. This move is legal because the ball we move (a 1 from A) matches the top ball (1) of tube D.\n\nThus, the move is to take the top ball from tube A and put it on tube D. \n\nAnswer: AD","The idea is to use tube A as the “collector” for color 4 because it already has a 4 at the bottom. Notice that tube F currently contains two 4’s on top (its top ball is 4, with another 4 just beneath it) and tube F’s top ball (4) can legally be moved onto tube A (whose top ball is also 4). This move will start building a uniform tube of 4’s. Therefore, the move is to take the top ball from tube F and pour it into tube A.\n\nAnswer: FA","One good move is to take the top ball from tube F (which is a 4) and pour it onto tube A. Tube A already has two 4s, and since its top ball is 4, the move is legal. This move will build toward one of the three solved tubes (four 4s in a tube) that we ultimately want.\n\nAnswer: FA","Here’s one valid solution that achieves three “solved” tubes (each with four balls of the same color). Notice that tube H is already solved (all 5’s), and tube A is nearly complete (three 4’s – just one more 4 is missing). In our solution we also complete tube D (which initially has two 1’s).\n\nThe moves are as follows:\n\n1. Move the top ball from tube E onto tube A.  \n • Tube A is [4, 4, 4, 0] (top is 4) so adding another 4 fits the rule. After this move tube A becomes [4, 4, 4, 4] (solved).  \n  (Move: EA)\n\n2.

To get the missing fourth 1 into tube D we must expose a 1 from tube C. Its configuration is [3, 2, 1, 6] so the top ball is a 6. We can move that 6 onto a tube where the top ball is 6. Tube E (after the first move) is now [3, 6, 0, 0] with top ball 6. So we move the top ball from tube C to tube E. This exposes the 1 beneath in tube C.  \n  (Move: CE)\n\n4. Now the top ball of tube C is 1. Finally, move it onto tube D (whose top is 1).

(Remember: even though tubes have “0” in the display for empty spaces, we treat the top ball as the highest non‐zero ball.) Since you may only move a top ball onto a tube whose current top ball has the same color (or that is completely empty), moving the 4 from tube E onto tube A is a legal and very attractive move—it completes tube A into four balls of color 4. (Tube H is already solved with four 5’s.) Later moves could be used to finish a third uniform tube, but the requested answer is a single move represented by two letters. In this case the move is to take the top ball from tube E and move it onto tube A, which we denote by “EA.”\n\nAnswer: EA","I'll start by explaining one winning line of thought. Notice that tubes A and H are already “complete” (all 4’s and all 5’s). Therefore, to reach the goal of getting three tubes full of a single color we only need one more homogeneous tube. One promising candidate is the 1’s because there are exactly four 1’s on the board:\n• Tube D already holds two 1’s ([1, 1, 0, 0]).\n• Tube F contains a 1 on top ([3, 1, 0, 0]).\n• Tube C hides a 1 (its third ball is 1 in [3, 2, 1, 6]) but the 1 is blocked by a 6 at the top.\n\nWe can eventually move the 1 from Tube C into Tube D (whose top is 1) so that Tube D becomes four 1’s. However, before doing so the top ball in Tube C (a 6) must be removed. In keeping with the rule that a ball may only be moved if it matches the top color of the destination tube (or the destination is empty), we check where that 6 can go. Tube E is a good candidate because it currently has [3, 6, 0, 0] with a top ball of 6. (Tube E isn’t one we’re planning to make homogeneous for 1’s.) \n\nSo the first move will be to move the top ball of Tube C (a 6) onto Tube E where the top is also 6. This move (from C to E) is indicated by the two letters “CE”. After that move Tube C becomes [3, 2, 1, 0] and its top ball is now the 1 needed to later move into Tube D, setting the stage for completing Tube D as all 1’s.\n\nThus, the best next move is:\n\nAnswer: CE","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube B onto tube E. In tube B the top ball is a 6 and in tube E the current top ball is also 6 (even though tube E isn’t solved yet because it has a lower ball of a different color, it is legal to add a 6 on top). This move is allowed by the rule (the ball being moved matches the target’s top ball) and it makes progress toward eventually consolidating all 6’s in one tube.\n\nAnswer: BE","I'll analyze the board.

Right now tubes A and H are solved. One good candidate to finish is tube D since it already has two 1’s. Notice that the top ball in both C and F is 1. A good move is to consolidate the 1’s into tube D so that it is one move away from being completed with 1’s. For example, if we take the top ball (1) from tube F (which is allowed since F’s top ball is 1) and put it on top of tube D (whose top ball is also 1), then tube D becomes [1, 1, 1, 0]. (Later, another 1 can be added to complete it and that would achieve three solved tubes: A, D, and H.) \n\nThus, a valid move under the rules is to move F’s top ball onto tube D.

It has three 1’s and an empty space. We need to add a ball of color 1 onto Tube D.\n\nNow we check which tube has a top ball of color 1. In Tube C, which is represented as [3,2,1,0], the rightmost non‑zero ball (i.e. its top ball) is 1. The rule allows us to move a ball if it either matches the top ball on the target tube or the target tube is empty. Here, Tube D’s top ball is 1, so placing another 1 from Tube C is allowed.\n\nThus, the move is to take the top ball from Tube C and place it on Tube D.

Notice that tube C is nearly solved with three 3’s (it’s [3,3,3,0]) and tube F is almost done with three 6’s ([6,6,6,0]). However, tube E is mixed ([3,6,0,0]) with the top ball being 6 (since the nonzero balls are at the bottom and the top‐ball is the rightmost nonzero). So, first we move the 6 from tube E onto tube F because the top ball of F is 6 (a valid move by the rules). This makes tube F become [6,6,6,6] (a completed tube of 6’s) and leaves tube E looking like [3,0,0,0] (with 3 now as its top ball). Next, we move the 3 from tube E onto tube C – now that tube C’s top ball is 3 the move is allowed. That completes tube C as [3,3,3,3]. With these moves the goal is achieved (three tubes have been solved, and you might even have more completed already).\n\nSo the moves are:\n Move 1: from tube E to tube F (EF)\n Move 2: from tube E to tube C (EC)\n\nAnswer: EF EC","We can look for a move that both follows the rules and helps reach the goal of having tubes with four balls of the same color. In the current board, several tubes are already “completed” (all four balls are identical): A (all 4’s), D (all 1’s), G (all 2’s), and H (all 5’s). Meanwhile, tube F currently contains three 6’s ([6, 6, 6, 0]) and its top ball is a 6. Notice that tube E is [3, 6, 0, 0] so its top (the last filled spot) is a 6, even though the bottom ball there is a 3 (which we cannot move until it becomes top). \n\nBecause a move is allowed if the ball you’re moving (here a 6 from the top of tube E) matches the color of the ball at the top of the destination tube (tube F has a 6 on its top), you can move the 6 from E to F. Doing so fills tube F completely with four 6’s ([6, 6, 6, 6]), and then tube F becomes completed. (After that, tube E will then expose its bottom ball, a 3, which might be used later if you wish to complete tube C, but the winning move here is the one just made.) \n\nThus, the best move is to move the top ball from tube E onto tube F.\n\nAnswer: EF","I'll analyze the board first. We number each tube’s positions from bottom (leftmost digit) to top (rightmost digit). For tube C, the balls are [3, 3, 3, 0] — that is, three balls (all color 3) at the bottom with one empty slot at the top. Tube E has [3, 0, 0, 0], meaning it contains just one ball (color 3) at the bottom, with empty spaces above it. To complete a tube of four balls all having the same color, we can add a ball of color 3 onto the tube that already has three “3”s in it. The rules state that when moving a ball, the top ball of the source tube must be moved onto a target tube whose current top is either empty or has the same color as the ball being moved. Tube C, with an empty top, meets that requirement. Also, tube E’s only ball (the top ball) is color 3.\n\nThus, by moving the top ball from tube E to tube C, tube C becomes [3, 3, 3, 3]—a complete, uniform tube of color 3. That formation of a completed tube fits the objective of having tubes contain exactly four balls of the same color. \n\nFollowing the required answer format (with two letters indicating the move’s source and target, respectively), the move is from tube E onto tube C. \n\nAnswer: EC"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Because only moves into an empty tube are allowed at the start (since all of A–E are full and a move is legal only if the target is empty or has the same color on top), a good first move is to take the top ball (a 5) from tube A and move it onto an empty tube (for example, tube F).

Because the rule requires that the ball being moved either match the top ball of the target tube (in this case 5 on tube F) or that the target tube be empty, moving the top ball from tube A to tube F is legal. This move brings us one step closer to assembling a four‑ball tube of color 5.\n\nAnswer: AF","A good move is to move the top ball from tube A onto tube F.

Since the moved ball’s color matches the top ball of tube F and tube F is not full, this move is legal and helps in grouping the four 5’s together in one tube.\n\nAnswer: AF","I looked for a move that makes progress toward creating a tube with a single color. In this case one promising idea is to build a tube of 2’s. Notice that there are exactly four occurrences of 2 on the board (one in B, two in C, and one in D). Tube C currently has a 2 at its top (since its content is [4, 2, 3, 2]). We can move that top 2, and since the destination tube must be either empty or have a top ball of the same color, we choose an empty tube. Tube G is entirely empty ([0, 0, 0, 0]). So we can legally move the top ball (color 2) from tube C onto tube G.\n\nThus the move is to take the top ball from tube C and place it on tube G.\n\nAnswer: CG","I'll choose to move the top ball (a 3) from tube E onto tube C. Currently, tube E is [3, 5, 4, 3] (so its top ball is 3) and tube C is [4, 2, 3, 0] (its top ball is 3 and with one free space). Because the moved ball’s color (3) matches the top ball of tube C and tube C isn’t full, this move is legal.\n\nAnswer: EC","The only legal move from a full tube onto a non‐full tube (whose top ball matches) is to move the top ball from tube D. Its top ball is a 4. Among the available tubes (A, E, F, G), only tube E has a top ball of 4. Therefore, you can move from D onto E.\n\nAnswer: DE","I'll choose, as the first step, to move the top ball from tube D onto tube A. In tube D the top ball is a 1 and tube A already shows a 1 at its top (since its only ball is a 1). This obeys the rule that you may move a ball if it matches the target’s top ball. (This move helps start gathering the color‐1 balls together so that one tube eventually can become four 1’s, one of the three solved tubes.) \n\nAnswer: DA","I examined the board and found a move that opens up one tube for future play. Notice that tube G holds a single ball—color 2—and tube D has two balls with its top already a 2. Since the moving rule allows placing a ball onto a tube whose top is the same color, we can move the ball from tube G onto tube D. (Also, tube D isn’t full—it has only two balls—so there’s room for the extra 2 and the move is legal.) The immediate effect is that tube G becomes completely empty. Having an empty tube is very useful for the later planned moves (for example, using it to help reveal or relocate hidden balls so that we can eventually consolidate four balls of one color into a tube). \n\nThus, the move is to take the top ball from tube G and place it onto tube D, which we denote with the two‐letter answer: “GD.”\n\nAnswer: GD","I'll analyze the board first. Each tube is shown from bottom (left) to top (right). For example, tube D is [1, 2, 2, 0] meaning the tube has three balls – the bottom ball is 1, then two 2’s – and one empty spot. We’re allowed to take the top ball from any tube and put it onto another tube if that tube is either empty or its top ball is the same color as the ball being moved.\n\nLooking for progress toward our goal (getting three full tubes of four balls all the same color), notice that tube A already has two 1’s at the bottom. In order to eventually complete a tube of 1’s one strategy is to “uncover” any extra 1’s hidden behind other balls. In tube D the bottom ball is 1 but it is blocked by two 2’s on top. If we remove the top ball of D – the uppermost 2 – we will then eventually expose that 1. Since the rule allows a ball to be moved into an empty tube regardless of its color, we can move the top 2 from tube D into tube G (which is empty). This move is valid and seems strategic as it begins to free up tube D so that the 1 at the bottom will be accessible for moving later onto tube A, helping us accumulate four 1’s in one tube.\n\nSo the move is: move the top ball from tube D to tube G, which we denote by “DG”.\n\nAnswer: DG","I'll analyze the board. For example, look at tube D and tube G:\n• Tube D currently is [1, 2, 0, 0] so its top ball is 2.\n• Tube G is [2, 0, 0, 0] so its only (bottom) ball is 2.\nBecause the rule says that the ball being moved must match the top ball of the target (if it isn’t empty), we can legally move the top ball 2 from tube D onto tube G. That move is denoted by “DG,” meaning moving the top ball from tube D onto tube G.\nAfter the move, the boards become:\n • Tube D becomes [1, 0, 0, 0] (only ball 1 remains)\n • Tube G becomes [2, 2, 0, 0]\nThis move sets the stage for further consolidation of a color group (in this case, the color “2”), moving toward the goal of creating three tubes each completely full with balls of a single color.\n\nAnswer: DG","We can choose a simple, legal move. Look at tube A and tube D. Tube A’s top ball is a 1, and tube D already has a 1 at the top (its only ball), so moving the 1 from A to D is allowed under the rule (“the ball being moved must either match the color of the ball at the top of the target tube or the target tube must be empty”). After the move, tube D will have two 1’s (helping to build a tube of uniform 1’s that may later be completed to four 1’s), and tube A will be left with one 1. \n\nThus the move is: from tube A to tube D.\n\nAnswer: AD","I'll choose to move the top 1 from tube D to tube A. In tube D the top ball is 1, and tube A’s top ball is also 1 (since its only ball is 1). This move is allowed by the rules and helps begin the consolidation of all color‐1 balls into tube A. (Eventually this will help in forming one uniform tube with four 1’s, contributing toward the target of having three tubes each filled with four balls of the same color.)\n\nAnswer: DA","I'll start by analyzing the board. The tubes are shown as follows with the bottom‐to‐top order:\n A: [1, 1, 0, 0] – contains two balls of color 1\n B: [2, 1, 4, 3] – four balls (2,1,4,3)\n C: [4, 2, 3, 3] – four balls (4,2,3,3)\n D: [1, 0, 0, 0] – one ball of color 1\n E: [3, 5, 4, 4] – four balls (3,5,4,4)\n F: [5, 5, 5, 0] – three balls of color 5\n G: [2, 2, 0, 0] – two balls of color 2\n\nSince our goal is eventually to get three tubes each with four balls of the same color, one promising strategy is to build a tube based on one of the available colors. For example, tubes A and D both have color 1. Tube A already has two 1’s so if we can add another 1 on it it will be closer to being completed. Tube D, with a single 1, is available as a donor. \n\nThe rules allow us to move a ball if the ball being moved matches the top ball of the target tube (or the tube is empty). Tube A currently has a top ball of 1 (its nonempty part is [1,1]), and tube D’s top ball is also 1. Therefore, moving the top ball from D onto A is a legal move. \n\nAfter this move, tube A becomes [1, 1, 1, 0] (three 1’s) and tube D becomes empty, opening it as a possible buffer later. This move is a playable and purposeful step toward constructing a homogeneous tube of 1’s.\n\nAnswer: DA","I'll analyze the board. For example, tube F contains three 5’s (it shows [5, 5, 5, 0]) so it’s almost complete—a tube with four 5’s would be a solved tube. To finish tube F later we need an extra 5. Looking at tube E ([3, 5, 4, 4]), notice that the concealed 5 is blocked by two 4’s on top. Our goal can be to eventually expose that 5 in tube E by first moving one of the top 4’s. Since tube D ([0, 0, 0, 0]) is completely empty, the move must be legal: the ball being moved (from E) is allowed to go into an empty tube regardless of color. Therefore, if we move the top ball of tube E (a 4) to tube D, we would be one step closer—later we can remove the next 4 from E to reveal the needed 5 for tube F.\n\nThus, the move is to transfer the top ball from tube E to tube D, which we represent with the two letters “ED”. \n\nAnswer: ED","I'll explain my reasoning step‐by‐step. One winning strategy is to eventually “complete” three tubes by collecting the four balls of a color. For example, note that tube A already has three 1’s ([1,1,1,0]) and the only missing 1 is hidden in tube B. In order to later move that 1 over (by clearing B’s top balls) we can first “free up” a tube to help shift blocking balls. One fruitful idea is to work with the four‐balls color 4. Look at tube D, which currently holds a single 4 ([4,0,0,0]). Since tube E has 4 already on top ([3,5,4,0] has 4 as its top ball), we can legally move that top 4 from E onto tube D (because the moving ball’s color, 4, matches the top ball in D, which is 4). (Remember the rule: you may move a ball only onto a tube whose top ball is the same color as the ball being moved—or if the whole tube is empty.) \n\nThus, the move that starts a winning sequence is to move the top ball in tube E (a 4) to tube D. In the two‐letter notation that means “ED” (moving from E to D).\n\nAfter that move the board becomes:\n A: [1, 1, 1, 0]\n B: [2, 1, 4, 3]\n C: [4, 2, 3, 3]\n D: [4, 4, 0, 0]\n E: [3, 5, 0, 0]\n F: [5, 5, 5, 0]\n G: [2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nThis move “ED” is the first in a winning plan (one can then eventually remove the obstructing balls in B to let the lone 1 join A, complete one tube, and then use similar logic for another color). \n\nFollowing the instructions I now give the move in the required format.\n\nAnswer: ED","I'll move the top ball from tube E onto tube F. Tube E’s top ball is 5 and tube F’s current top ball is 5, so the move is legal. This move completes tube F (making it [5, 5, 5, 5]), which is one step toward having three tubes each containing four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: EF","I analyzed the board and noticed that color 1 appears only 4 times (three already in tube A and one in tube B). Since tube A already has three 1’s, our ideal plan is to complete it by moving the remaining 1 from tube B. However, tube B’s top ball is currently a 3 rather than a 1. We can’t move a ball directly from B to A because the rules require that the top ball of the destination either be empty or have the same color as the ball being moved.\n\nThe best strategy is to remove the top ball from tube B. The ball on top of tube B is a 3. We need a destination tube where a 3 can be legally placed. Tube E currently has a 3 at the bottom (its only ball) and empty spaces above. Since its top ball (3) matches the ball we want to move (3), the rules allow us to transfer the ball from B to E.\n\nThus, the move is to take the top ball from tube B and place it onto the top of tube E. This is indicated by the two letters \"BE.\"\n\nAnswer: BE","I'll analyze the tubes. Tube D currently has two 4’s (with two empty slots) and its top ball is a 4. Tube B’s top ball is a 4 (from [2, 1, 4, 0]), so we can legally move that 4 onto tube D. This move helps complete a tube of the same colored balls. \n\nAnswer: BD","I'll analyze the board:\n\n• Tube A: [1, 1, 1, 0] contains three 1's.\n• Tube B: [2, 1, 0, 0] has a top ball 1.\n• Tube C: [4, 2, 3, 3]\n• Tube D: [4, 4, 4, 0] contains three 4's.\n• Tube E: [3, 3, 0, 0]\n• Tube F: [5, 5, 5, 5] is already a complete tube of 5's.\n• Tube G: [2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nThe goal is to have three tubes each with four balls of the same color. Tube F is complete, and Tube A already has three 1's. If we move the top ball from Tube B (which is a 1) onto Tube A, then Tube A becomes [1, 1, 1, 1] – a complete tube of color 1.\n\nThat valid move is represented by two letters: the first indicating the source (B) and the second the target (A). \n\nAnswer: BA","We can win by completing the tube that already contains two 3’s. Notice that tube E is [3, 3, 0, 0] so it already has two balls, and its top (the last filled ball) is 3. Meanwhile tube C is [4, 2, 3, 3] – its top ball is 3. By moving the two top 3’s from tube C to tube E we will end up with tube E holding [3, 3, 3, 3] (four 3’s), which makes it complete. (Tubes A and F are already complete.) \n\nHere’s the sequence:\n1. First move: Take the top ball (a 3) from tube C and place it on tube E. That is allowed since tube E’s top ball is 3. After this move, tube C becomes [4, 2, 3, 0] and tube E becomes [3, 3, 3, 0].\n2. Second move: Now the top ball of tube C is again a 3. Moving that 3 onto tube E (whose top ball is 3) gets tube E to [3, 3, 3, 3].\n\nThus, the two moves are both “CE” (move from C to E).\n\nAnswer: CE CE","We already have two solved tubes – tube A is all 1’s and tube F is all 5’s – so we need to complete just one more tube that has four balls of a single color. One natural candidate is tube E, which already contains two 3’s:\n • Tube E: [3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nTube C, on the other hand, is [4, 2, 3, 3] (with the top ball being a 3). Notice that the two top balls in tube C are 3’s, and since the rule lets you move a ball if its color matches the top ball of the target (or if the target is empty), you can pour the top ball from tube C onto tube E (whose current top ball is also 3). Doing so twice will add both 3’s from the top of C onto tube E, giving:\n\n• First move: Move from tube C to tube E.\n  – Tube C becomes: [4, 2, 3, 0]\n  – Tube E becomes: [3, 3, 3, 0]\n\n• Second move: Move again from tube C to tube E.\n  – Tube C becomes: [4, 2, 0, 0]\n  – Tube E becomes: [3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nNow tubes A, E, and F each contain four balls of the same color, fulfilling the goal.\n\nThus, the sequence of moves needed is: move from C to E, then again from C to E.\n\nAnswer: CE,CE","I'll choose the move that helps complete one of the incomplete tubes.

And note that tubes A ([1,1,1,1]) and F ([5,5,5,5]) are already completed, so completing tube E with 3’s would bring the total to three complete tubes.\n\nThus, the move is from tube C to tube E.\n\nAnswer: CE","The best move is to take the top ball from tube C (which is a 3) and move it onto tube E. Since tube E already has three 3’s at the bottom and its top ball is 3, adding another 3 will fill tube E with four balls of the same color, thus achieving one of the three complete tubes.\n\nAnswer: CE","The idea is to “free” tube C’s bottom ball (which is a 4) so that it can be moved onto tube D (which already holds three 4’s). Notice that tube C currently holds [4,2] (bottom to top) so its top ball is 2. And tube B shows [2,0,0,0] with 2 at the bottom. Since a move is only allowed when the moving ball matches the top ball of the destination tube (or the destination is empty), you cannot move tube C’s top ball (2) directly to tube D (whose top is 4). \n\nThe solution is to make a “helper” move: move the top ball from tube C (a 2) to tube B (which has a 2 at its top). That is, move from C to B (“CB”). After that move, tube C will have [4,0,0,0] (its only ball is now the 4 at the top), and later you can move that 4 onto tube D.

According to the rule the ball being moved must match the color of the top ball of the target tube (tube D’s top is 4) or the target is empty. Here, tube C’s top is 4, so it can move onto tube D.\nMoving the top ball from tube C to tube D fills tube D with four 4’s.

This appears to be a productive move towards eventually creating a tube of four balls of the same color, particularly building a tube with all 5’s.\n\nAnswer: BG","I'll analyze the board:\n• Tube C is [6, 2, 6, 2] so its top ball is 2.\n• Tube B is [4, 3, 2, 0] so its top non‐empty ball is 2 (in the third slot) and the tube has an empty slot.\nSince the moved ball (a 2 from tube C) matches the top ball of tube B (a 2) and there’s room in tube B, moving the top ball from C to B is a legal move that helps toward grouping balls.\n\nThus, the move is to transfer the top ball from tube C onto the top of tube B.\n\nAnswer: CB","One promising first move is to free a tube so that the pair of “1”s already appearing in tube A (and the “1”s in tube D) can later be combined into a homogeneous stack. Currently tube D has [4, 1, 4, 1] with a top ball of 1, and tube H is completely empty. By moving the top ball from D to H, we get:\n\n • Tube D becomes [4, 1, 4] (with top now 4)  \n • Tube H becomes [1]\n\nThis move is legal because the target tube (H) is empty, and it will help in eventually grouping the four 1’s (two in tube A and two originally in tube D) into one tube. \n\nAnswer: DH","I'll analyze the board first.\n\n• Each tube holds up to 4 balls. A “0” marks an empty space. Only the top‐nonzero ball of a tube can be moved.\n• A ball can be moved only onto a tube whose top ball is the same color or that is completely empty.\n\nLooking at tube H we see it contains just one ball (which is a 1). Meanwhile, tube A’s top ball is also 1. Notice that all balls of color 1 total exactly 4 (two in A, one in D, and one in H). By moving the top 1 from tube A into tube H (which also currently shows 1 on top) we can help build a tube that will eventually be all 1’s.\n\nThus, a good move is to move the top ball from tube A onto tube H. In our two‐letter move notation this is “AH.”\n\nAnswer: AH","I'll start by noting that tube A (with balls [5, 6, 1, 0]) has its top (uppermost nonzero) ball as 1, and tube H (with [1, 1, 0, 0]) currently has 1 at its top. Moving the top ball from A to H is legal since the ball (color 1) matches the color of H’s top ball. This move also helps toward our goal of eventually creating a tube full of 1’s (since all 1’s occur exactly 4 times overall).\n\nThus, a good move is to transfer the top ball from tube A to tube H.\n\nAnswer: AH","One promising strategy is to focus on forming a tube of color 1. Tube H already contains three 1’s (with an empty top slot), and there’s one additional 1 in tube D (beneath a top 4). However, that 1 isn’t accessible until the ball above it is moved. Notice that tube D’s top ball is 4. We can legally move that 4 ball to tube F because its top ball is also 4 (F’s current state is [3, 3, 4] with an empty space on top). Once we move the 4 from D onto F, tube D will have its top ball become 1, which then can later be moved into tube H to complete a homogeneous tube of 1’s. \n\nThus, the legal move we recommend is moving the top ball from tube D to tube F.\n\nAnswer: DF","Here’s the reasoning. Look at tube H:\n H: [1, 1, 1, 0] – It has three balls of color 1 and one empty slot.\nTo complete that tube so it has four balls all of the same color, we need a ball colored 1 from somewhere.\n\nNow, check tube D:\n D: [4, 1, 0, 0] – Its top (rightmost non‐zero) ball is 1.\nSince a move’s rule allows placing a ball onto a tube if its top ball is of the same color (or the tube is empty), we can legally move the top ball “1” from tube D to tube H.\n\nAfter move “DH”:\n Tube D becomes [4, 0, 0, 0] (only a 4 remains) and\n Tube H becomes [1, 1, 1, 1] – achieving a solved tube.\nThis is a step toward our goal of having three solved (uniform) tubes.\n\nAnswer: DH","I analyzed the board and noticed that tube D already has a 4 at its bottom ([4, 0, 0, 0]). In tube F the top‐two balls are both 4’s (with tube F given as [3, 3, 4, 4]). One promising step is to move the top 4 from F onto tube D. (This move is legal because the top ball in tube D is also 4.) Although many moves can be part of a complete solution, this move is a natural first step toward creating a fully “solved” tube of a single color (in this case, 4) and thus working toward the goal of having three tubes with four same‐colored balls.\n\nAnswer: FD","A good move is to transfer the top ball from tube F (which is 4) onto tube D. Tube D’s top is also 4, so the move is allowed. After the move, tube D will have three 4’s ([4, 4, 4, 0]) while tube F becomes [3, 3, 0, 0]. This move helps progress toward consolidating the balls by color to eventually form tubes with four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: FD","I'll start by examining the situation. Recall the rule: when moving a ball, you take the top ball of a source tube and can only drop it on an empty tube (one that has no balls at all) or on a tube whose current top ball has the same color. (Each tube is visualized from bottom to top.)\n\nLooking at the tubes:\n• Tube D is nearly “solved” since it already contains three 4’s (its state is [4, 4, 4, 0]). If we could put a fourth 4 on it in one move, it would be one of our three “solved” tubes. However, none of the tubes shows a top ball of 4.\n• Tube H ([1, 1, 1, 1]) is already solved.\n• That leaves us with tubes that might be built into homogeneous tubes. Notice that Tube A’s state is [5, 6, 0, 0] (with top ball 6). While its bottom ball is a 5 we’d like to use eventually in building a tube of 5’s, the 6 sits on top. If we remove that 6 in a legal move – that is, by moving it onto a tube whose top ball is also 6 (or an empty tube) – tube A will then reveal its 5. And Tube G ([5, 5, 0, 0]) already has two 5’s with top 5. With Tube A’s 5 joining Tube G later, it would be easier to work toward a tube of four 5’s.\n  \nOne legal move to accomplish this is to take the top ball (a 6) from Tube A and move it to Tube C. Why Tube C? Its state is [6, 2, 6, 0] and its top ball is 6. The move is legal because the ball we move (6) matches the top ball (6) of Tube C. After this move, Tube A becomes [5, 0, 0, 0] (revealing the 5), while Tube C becomes [6, 2, 6, 6]. This move clears the way in Tube A to eventually contribute to a tube of 5’s (for example, with Tube G).\n\nFollowing the instructions, I provide my answer as two letters: the first being the source (A) and the second being the destination (C).\n\nAnswer: AC","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube A to tube G. Tube A’s top ball is a 5, and tube G’s top ball is also 5. Since tube G isn’t full (it currently has two 5’s) and its top ball matches, this move is valid and also helps in forming a tube with four identical balls.\n\nAnswer: AG","We can begin by making a move that starts to uncover a tube that is nearly solved. Notice tube D already has three 4’s with an empty top ([4, 4, 4, 0]). To take advantage of that, we want to eventually get a 4 onto tube D. Currently the only tube that contains a 4 is tube B ([4, 3, 2, 2]) but its 4 is at the bottom. Hence, we must work on tube B to reveal that 4. The top ball of B is a 2 and can be moved to any empty tube. Since tube A is completely empty ([0, 0, 0, 0]), we can move the top ball of B (which is 2) to A. This move is legal because the destination is empty and it begins the process of uncovering the underlying 3 and then the 4 in tube B so that later a 4 could be moved onto tube D, aiming at forming a uniform tube of color 4.\n\nThus, the move is: move the top ball from tube B to tube A.\n\nAnswer: BA","We can solve the puzzle in several moves. One winning strategy is to complete tube D (to hold four 4’s) and tube G (to hold four 5’s) in addition to the already‐completed tube H (with 1’s). For example, one solution sequence is as follows:\n\n1. Move from tube B to tube A. (Move “BA”.)\n • Tube A starts with [2, 0, 0, 0] so its top ball is 2; tube B is [4, 3, 2, 0] with top ball 2. Since the moved ball (2) matches tube A’s top ball (2) or tube A is nonempty with a matching color, this move is allowed. After the move, tube A becomes [2,2,0,0] and tube B becomes [4,3,0,0].\n2. Next, remove the top ball from tube B (now 3) by moving it to tube F, whose top ball is 3. (Move “BF”.) This clears tube B so that its only remaining ball is a 4.\n3. Then move the remaining ball 4 from tube B to tube D (whose top ball is 4) to complete tube D. (Move “BD”.)\n4. To complete tube G (which is [5,5,5,0]), you need a 5. You can expose a 5 in tube E ([3,5,2,6]) by first moving its top ball 6 to an empty tube (e.g. tube B now empty) (move “EB”), then moving the new top ball 2 from E (which now is [3,5,2,0]) onto tube A (top ball 2) (move “EA”). This uncovers the 5 at the top of E. Finally, move that 5 to tube G (move “EG”) to complete it.\n   \nWith these moves the three tubes D, G, and H will each have four balls of the same color.\n\nSince the game requires that you provide two letters to represent one move – and our winning solution begins with moving the top ball from B onto A – one correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: BA","The idea is to free the 4 from tube B by moving its top ball (3) out. Notice that tube F already has a 3 on top ([3, 3, 0, 0]), so we can legally move the 3 from tube B (whose top is 3) onto tube F (because its top is 3). After that move, tube B will have only the 4 at its bottom, and that 4 is now accessible to be moved later onto tube D (which is nearly complete with three 4's). Hence, the recommended move is to move from tube B to tube F.\n\nAnswer: BF","I'll analyze the board first. Notice that tube D currently shows [4, 4, 4, 0] – meaning it has three 4's and an empty space at the top—and tube B shows [4, 0, 0, 0] with a single 4 at the bottom (its only ball). Since the rule requires that when moving a ball, its color must match the top ball of the target tube (or the target tube must be empty), moving the top ball (which is 4) from tube B onto tube D is a valid move. This would complete tube D to [4, 4, 4, 4], making it one of the three tubes that have all four balls of the same color. \n\nAnswer: BD","I examined the board and noticed that tubes D and H are already “solved” (each holds four balls of one color). To get a third completed tube one good strategy is to start gathering a color that appears exactly four times. For instance, there are exactly four 2’s in play (two in tube A, one in tube C, and one in tube E). Although the buried 2’s aren’t “accessible” immediately, a key step is to “free up” one of the 2’s so that in later moves they can be consolidated into an empty tube. Moving the top ball of tube A (a 2) into the empty tube B is allowed (empty tubes accept any ball) and helps set up a future complete “2‐tube.”\n\nThus the move to progress the puzzle is to move from tube A to tube B.\n\nAnswer: AB","One promising move is to help consolidate color 2. Notice that tube A contains a single 2 (with three empty spaces above) and tube B also has a 2 at the top. Since the rule lets you move a ball onto a tube whose top ball is the same color, we can move the top (and only) ball from tube A to tube B. This move is legal and is a step toward eventually gathering all four “2” balls (found in tube A, tube B, tube C’s second slot, and tube E’s third slot) into one tube – thereby forming a complete, homogeneous tube. (Recall we already have two complete tubes: tube D with all 4’s and tube H with all 1’s; so making a tube of four 2’s would meet the goal.)\n\nAnswer: AB","One promising move is to take the top ball from tube E (which is 6) and move it to the empty tube A. This is allowed because tube A is empty, and the rule permits moves to an empty tube. In addition, removing the 6 from tube E will expose the next ball (2) at its top – a color that can later be added onto tube B (which already holds two 2’s) to eventually complete a tube of 2’s. With tubes D and H already solved, creating a third completed tube (such as tube B with all 2’s) will bring you closer to the goal. \n\nAnswer: EA","One promising first step is to remove a 6 from the full but “mixed” tube C so that you can later free its odd ball (the 2) and gather all the 6’s together. Note that tube C is [6, 2, 6, 6] (with the top ball being 6) and tube A is [6, 0, 0, 0] (with its only ball, at the bottom, being 6 and the top accessible ball is “6”). Since one of the legal moves is to move a ball onto a tube whose top ball is the same color (or onto an empty tube), you can move the top ball (6) from tube C onto tube A. This yields:\n\n• Tube A becomes [6, 6, 0, 0]  \n• Tube C becomes [6, 2, 6, 0]\n\nThis move is strategic because you are starting to separate the colors. Ultimately your plan is to free tube C of its “intruder” color 2 so that it can eventually become a complete tube of 6’s (recalling that there are exactly four 6’s in total, one already in A and three in C). With tube D ([4,4,4,4]) and tube H ([1,1,1,1]) already complete, completing the 6’s (by a sequence beginning with the move from C to A) will meet the goal of having three tubes each containing exactly four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: CA","I looked over the board. Notice that tubes D and H are already “solved” (each has four balls of a single color). So our challenge is to finish one more tube. One promising idea is to work with the color 6 balls. Tube A has two 6’s (A: [6, 6, 0, 0]) and tube C has two 6’s (its bottom and third ball) even though a 2 is “trapped” between them. The rule lets us only move the top ball. In tube C the top ball is a 6. If we move that 6 onto tube A the move is valid (because the top ball in A is 6). After doing so, tube A becomes [6, 6, 6, 0]—three 6’s nearly complete—and tube C drops down to [6, 2, 0, 0] with its top now 2. This move “CA” (from tube C onto tube A) is valid and sets us up for eventually adding the final 6 needed to complete tube A, thereby reaching three tubes (D, H and A) each with four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: CA","The best move is to take the top ball from tube C (which is a 2) and move it onto tube B, since tube B’s top ball is also a 2. This move is legal because tube B isn’t full and its top ball matches the ball being moved. Additionally, this move will help free up tube C so that its lower ball (a 6) can later be moved into tube A, which already contains three 6’s and is just one move away from being solved. With tube D and H already complete, completing tube A (by eventually adding a 6 from C) or tube B (by adding one more 2 later) will meet the goal of having three tubes each full of four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: CB","We can complete one of the tubes containing color 6. Notice that tube A currently holds three 6’s ([6,6,6,0]) and tube C holds a single 6 ([6,0,0,0]). By moving the top ball (a 6) from tube C onto tube A, the top ball of tube A is also a 6 so the move is allowed. This will result in tube A having four 6’s ([6,6,6,6]), which is a complete tube. With tube D ([4,4,4,4]) and tube H ([1,1,1,1]) already complete, we then have three tubes each containing exactly four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: CA","We notice that tube B currently has three 2’s and an empty slot (B: [2, 2, 2, 0]) while tube E has a top ball 2 (E: [3, 5, 2, 0]).

This move fills tube B with four 2’s, meeting the goal for a solved tube (four balls of the same color). \n\nAnswer: EB","The best move here is to take the top ball from tube E (which is a 5) and place it onto tube G. Since tube G’s top ball is also a 5, this move is legal and completes the four balls of color 5 in tube G. \n\nAnswer: EG","The best move is to transfer the top ball from tube F to tube E.

In order to eventually set up a tube of all 1’s, we first need to “free” the hidden 1 by removing the balls on top of it. Because only the top ball may be moved, the best first move is to remove the 3 (the top ball in tube C). The rules allow moving a ball either onto another tube if its top ball is the same color or onto an empty tube.

(There may be several valid solutions.) For example, one good start is to take the top ball from tube A and pour it onto tube D. (Remember that in tube A the balls from bottom to top are 2, 3, 2 and in tube D they are 4, 2, 2 so that the top of D is a 2 – matching the ball from A.) Although the entire solution requires several moves, if we had to “pick one move” that begins the process toward ending up with three full tubes of one color (namely one tube for all 2’s, one for all 1’s and one for all 4’s in one valid solution) then the very first move is to move the top ball from A onto D. \n\nHere’s a short outline of one valid solution sequence:\n1. Move from A to D (“AD”). In A the top ball is 2 and in D the top ball is 2 so the move is legal.\n2. Later moves (not all shown here) let you free a nearly‐complete tube F of 1’s and then later consolidate all four 2’s into one tube (by eventually emptying one tube to hold extra 2’s) and then, by “clearing” a tube of interfering balls, consolidate four 4’s.\nBy the end of the sequence three tubes turn out “solved” (each filled with four balls of a single color).\n\nThus one valid first move toward the goal is: \n\nAnswer: AD","I'll start by analyzing the board.

Notice Tube G has a sole ball (a 3). We see that Tube A’s top ball is also a 3. Since one of the rules is that a ball may be moved onto a tube whose top ball matches its color (or if the tube is empty), we can move the 3 from Tube G onto Tube A. \n\nAfter this move:\n• Tube A becomes [2, 3, 3] (now three balls, two of which are 3’s on top)\n• Tube G becomes empty, providing extra space for later maneuvers.\n\nThis move is a good starting step in our process to eventually end up with three tubes containing four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: GA","The idea is to start “unlocking” one of the tubes that could eventually be completed to make a monochrome tube. Look at tube C, which is [1, 4, 4, 0] (so it effectively holds two balls: 1 at the bottom and 4 on top of it). Our goal is to eventually isolate the 1 underneath, but first we must clear away the top ball(s) that are in the way. One legal move is to remove the top 4 from tube C. Since tube G is completely empty (and an empty tube accepts any ball), we can move the 4 from tube C into tube G. This is represented by two letters: the first is the source (C) and the second is the target (G).\n\nThus the proposed move is “CG.”\n\nAnswer: CG","The best move is to clear the 4 on top of tube C so that the lone 1 at its bottom can later be moved to tube F (which already has three 1’s), completing that tube. To remove the 4 from tube C, we must put it onto a tube whose top ball is also 4 or is empty. Looking at the board, tube G already has a 4 at its bottom (and its top is 4) so it is the only valid target. Therefore, the move is to transfer the top ball (4) from tube C to tube G.\n\nAnswer: CG","I'll examine the board carefully. Notice that tube F already holds three 1’s: [1, 1, 1, 0]. In order to complete a homogeneous tube of 1’s, we simply need to add one more ball of color 1. Tube C currently has the single ball 1 ([1, 0, 0, 0]). Its top ball (which is the only ball in C) is 1. Since tube F’s top ball is also 1, moving the top ball from C to F is allowed by the rule “the ball being moved must match the color of the ball at the top of the target tube (or target is empty).” Also, tube F has an available slot.\n\nThus, the move is: from tube C onto tube F.\n\nAnswer: CF","It can be helpful to start by “unlocking” one of the nearly complete tubes. Notice that tube D currently is [4, 2, 2, 2]—if we remove the top ball (a 2) from D and place it into an empty tube (tube C is empty), then later we can use tube C as the gathering place for all of the 2’s (recalling that tube A also has a 2 at its bottom). By doing this move the obstructing 4 at the bottom of D will eventually be isolated and the three “2”s in D (and the lone “2” from A once its overlying balls are moved) could be recombined in one tube to yield four 2’s. (A complete tube of four balls of the same color is one of our three targets; we already have tube F as the tube of 1’s.) \n\nThus, a good first move – abiding by the rule that the ball being moved must either match the target tube’s top or the target be empty – is to move the top ball of tube D (a 2) onto tube C (which is empty). \n\nAnswer: DC","I analyzed the board and noticed that one promising move is to help complete the tube for color 2. Currently, Tube C holds a single 2 at its bottom ([2, 0, 0, 0]), and Tube D contains a contiguous group of two 2’s on its top (its balls are [4, 2, 2, 0] so the top “2,2” can be moved). Because Tube C’s current top ball (which is the only ball it contains) is 2, it can accept additional 2’s. If we move the top balls from Tube D onto Tube C, then Tube C will have three 2’s ([2, 2, 2, 0]), which is one step closer to being completed (a solved tube must have four balls all of the same color). (Tube F is already complete with four 1’s and we need three solved tubes overall.) \n\nThus, a valid move is to pour the top ball group from Tube D to Tube C.\n \nAnswer: DC","I'll analyze the board. Note that tube F already has four 1’s so it’s complete. Looking at the remaining colors, one promising approach is to complete the tube with all 2’s. In the board we have four 2’s in total:\n • Tube A has a 2 at the bottom (but it’s blocked by two 3’s at the top).\n • Tube C already holds two 2’s and has two empty spaces.\n • Tube D contains a 2 on top (with a 4 at the bottom).\nSince tube C’s top ball is 2 and it isn’t full, we can legally move the top ball of tube D onto tube C (because the moving ball is 2 and it matches tube C’s top ball). After this move, tube C would have three 2’s and tube D would be left with just a 4. This move directly contributes toward forming a tube with four 2’s, which is one of our winning tubes (adding to the completed tube F and one more to come later).\n\nThus, the move is to transfer the top ball from tube D to tube C.\n\nAnswer: DC","I examined the board. Tube F is already complete with [1, 1, 1, 1]. Looking at the possible moves, one nearly “solved” tube is tube D, which starts with a 4. Tube G has two balls [4, 4] with the top ball being a 4. Moving that 4 onto tube D is allowed because tube D’s top ball is 4. After moving from G to D, tube D would become [4, 4, 0, 0] (now having two 4’s), and tube G would have only one 4 left. This move is legal under the rule (the ball moved must match the target tube’s top color or the tube is empty) and it moves us toward assembling a tube with four of the same color. \n\nThus, the move is from tube G to tube D.\n\nAnswer: GD","Let’s take a close look at the board. We have seven tubes (A–G) with the following contents (from bottom to top):\n\n A: [2, 3, 3, 0] – three balls (2 then 3 then 3)\n B: [4, 5, 5, 0] – three balls (4 then 5 then 5)\n C: [2, 2, 2, 0] – three balls (all 2’s)\n D: [4, 4, 0, 0] – two balls (both 4’s)\n E: [5, 3, 3, 5] – four balls (5, 3, 3, 5)\n F: [1, 1, 1, 1] – four balls (all 1’s; already “solved”)\n G: [4, 0, 0, 0] – one ball (a single 4)\n\nThe end‐goal is to have three tubes each completely filled (four balls) with a single color. (For example, tube F is already solved with all 1’s.) We see that across the other colors there are exactly four balls:\n • Color 2: There are four in all (one in A and three in C),\n • Color 3: There are four (two in A and two in E),\n • Color 4: There are four (one in B, two in D, and one in G),\n • Color 5: There are four (two in B and two in E).\n\nA useful strategy is to work so that one of these colors “consolidates.” Notice that tube D already has two 4’s and tube G contains one 4. We can help build a solved tube for color 4 by combining them. However, the top balls matter because a move only allows taking the top ball and placing it on a tube whose top ball is of the same color (or if that tube is completely empty). Right now the “top” colors are:\n A: 3, B: 5, C: 2, D: 4, E: 5, F: 1, G: 4.\n\nOne legal move is to move the top ball of tube G (which is a 4) onto tube D. The rules allow this move because the top ball of tube D is also a 4 and tube D isn’t full (it has only two balls out of a capacity of four). Carrying out the move G → D does this:\n\n • Remove the 4 from tube G so that G becomes completely empty ([0, 0, 0, 0]), \n • Add that 4 onto the top of tube D so that D becomes [4, 4, 4, 0].\n\nThis move is beneficial because it creates an empty tube (G) that can later be used to temporarily hold balls while you work to clear a tube so that one of the nearly “solved” colors can be completed (for example, in building a complete set of four 4’s, or later consolidating another color).\n\nThus, according to the game board and the rules, the move “GD” is an excellent step.\n\nAnswer: GD","I'll analyze the board carefully. We already see that tube F is complete (it has four “1” balls). Meanwhile, tubes C and D each have three balls with a “0” (empty spot) at the top; if we could add a ball of the same color onto them (a “2” on C or a “4” on D), they would become complete.\n\nLooking at the board:\n• Tube A is [2, 3, 3, 0] (three balls, with 3 as the top ball).\n• Tube B is [4, 5, 5, 0] (top ball 5).\n• Tube C is [2, 2, 2, 0] (top ball 2).\n• Tube D is [4, 4, 4, 0] (top ball 4).\n• Tube E is [5, 3, 3, 5] (fully filled, top ball 5).\n• Tube F is [1, 1, 1, 1] (already complete).\n• Tube G is [0, 0, 0, 0] (empty).\n\nOne promising idea is to “unlock” a needed ball in tube A so that tube C (which wants a 2)–or similarly tube D–can be completed. In tube A the bottom is a 2, but it’s blocked by two “3” balls sitting on top. The rule tells us that only the top ball can be moved. We can free the 2 in tube A only if we move those two “3” balls somewhere legal.\n\nNotice that tube G is completely empty. A legal move allows you to move a ball if the target tube is empty.\nThus the next move can be to move the top ball (which is 3) from tube A onto the top of tube G. This move is denoted by “AG” (meaning: move from tube A to tube G).\n\nAfter that move, tube A becomes [2, 3, 0, 0] and tube G becomes [3, 0, 0, 0]. (Note that eventually the freed ball “2” from tube A can be moved onto tube C because the top ball in C is already 2, which is needed for completing tube C.) \n\nThus the immediate move I choose is:\n\nAnswer: AG","Let’s analyze the board. Our goal is to end up with exactly three “solved” tubes (each having four balls all of the same color). Notice that tube F is already solved with four 1’s. Two other tubes are “almost solved” if we can add one matching ball:\n • Tube C is [2,2,2,0] and needs one more 2.\n • Tube D is [4,4,4,0] and needs one more 4.\n\nOne useful strategy is to expose a needed ball so we can add it to one of these almost‐solved tubes. Look at tube A: it is [2,3,0,0]. Although it contains a 2 at the bottom, the top ball is 3 which “hides” the 2 underneath. If we can remove that 3 onto a tube with a 3 at the top (or an empty tube), then tube A’s top will become 2 and we can use it to complete tube C.\n\nNotice tube G is [3,0,0,0]—its bottom (and only) ball is a 3. Since the rule says you may move a ball onto a tube whose top ball is the same color (or which is empty), we can legally move the top ball from tube A (a 3) onto tube G (since its top is 3).\n\nThis move is a key first step. After moving 3 from A to G:\n • Tube A becomes [2,0,0,0] (with 2 now the only and thus top ball).\n • Tube G becomes [3,3,0,0].\n\nThat then sets up a follow‐up move (A to C) to complete tube C with four 2’s. (Additional moves would then be used to free a 4 from tube B so we can complete tube D.) \n\nFor our answer we provide the next move in the game: move the top ball from tube A onto tube G. In our two–letter notation that is written “AG.”\n\nAnswer: AG","I worked out a short solution that “completes” three tubes as follows. Notice that tube F is already full of 1’s. Also, tubes with three same‐colored balls need one more ball of that color to be “solved.” In our board the two easiest candidates are:\n\n• Tube C, which has [2,2,2,0] and so needs a 2. Tube A holds a 2 (its only ball) at the top so that a move from A to C yields C = [2,2,2,2].\n\n• Tube G, which shows [3,3,0,0] and needs two more 3’s. (There are exactly two extra 3’s coming from tube E.) However, in the tube E ([5,3,3,5]) the very top is a 5, so we must “free” the 3’s inside. We do that by first moving the 5 from the top of E into tube B (whose top ball is 5) so that E becomes [5,3,3,0]. Then the top ball of E is now 3. Two consecutive moves from E into G (whose top is 3) will add both 3’s from E onto G so that G becomes [3,3,3,3].\n\nThus, the sequence of moves is:\n\n1. A → C      (move the top 2 from A to C, completing tube C)\n2. E → B      (move the top 5 from E to B; B already ends with 5)\n3. E → G      (move the now‑exposed 3 from E to G)\n4. E → G      (move the remaining 3 from E to G, completing tube G)\n\nAfter these moves the “solved” tubes are:\n – Tube F: [1,1,1,1] (given)\n – Tube C: [2,2,2,2] (completed by move 1)\n – Tube G: [3,3,3,3] (completed by moves 3–4)\n\nThis meets the goal because three tubes now each hold exactly four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: AC EB EG EG","I'll analyze the tubes. Currently, tube C has three 2’s (C: [2, 2, 2, 0]), and tube A holds a 2 (A: [2, 0, 0, 0]). If we take the top ball from tube A (which is a 2) and move it to tube C, it lands on a 2. That move is legal because the ball being moved (2) matches the color of the top ball in tube C, and tube C has space. This move completes tube C (now [2, 2, 2, 2]), satisfying the goal for one tube having four same-colored balls.\n\nAnswer: AC","I'll start by checking the board. We already have two solved tubes:\n• Tube C: [2, 2, 2, 2] (color 2)\n• Tube F: [1, 1, 1, 1] (color 1)\n\nWe want one more tube that has four balls of the same color. Tube D is almost there with [4, 4, 4, 0] (three 4’s with an empty top slot), so if we can add a 4 to D then it will be solved.\n\nLooking at the board:\n• Tube B is [4, 5, 5, 0]. Its effective contents (ignoring the “0” empty slot) are 4 at the bottom and then two “5”s on top. (Remember you may only move the top ball from a tube.)  \n• To get the 4 ball needed for Tube D, we must uncover it in Tube B by removing the top two 5’s.  \n• The rule for moving a ball is that its color must match the top color of the destination tube (if the destination isn’t empty) or the destination tube can be completely empty.  \n• Tube A is empty ([0, 0, 0, 0]), so it is a perfect temporary target for a “5.”\n\nThe best first move is to take the top ball (a 5) from Tube B and move it to Tube A. That is indicated by “BA” (move from B to A). This move will uncover the next ball in Tube B, and after a couple more moves (moving the next 5 from B also to A and then moving the now-exposed 4 from B to D), Tube D would become [4, 4, 4, 4] — the third solved tube.\n\nSince the answer is required as two letters representing one move, the recommended first move is:\n\nAnswer: BA","We can reach the goal (three solved tubes) by completing tube D – it already has three 4’s and just needs one more 4 on top. Unfortunately, the only tube that holds a 4 isn’t immediately available on top: tube B shows [4, 5] (with 5 at the top). In order to expose the 4 at the bottom of B, we can make an intermediate move.\n\nStep 1. Move the top ball from tube B (a 5) onto tube A. (Tube A currently is [5] so its top is 5; since the ball 5 from B matches, the move is allowed.) \n  After this move:\n  • Tube A becomes [5, 5]\n  • Tube B becomes [4]\n\nStep 2. Now tube B has 4 at the top, and tube D (currently [4,4,4]) has a top ball 4 and an empty space.

To complete a third solved tube, we can aim to finish tube D (which is [4,4,4,0]). Its three balls of 4 need one more 4 on top.\n\nLooking at the board, tube B is [4,5,0,0] so it contains a 4 (at the bottom) but its top ball is 5. We cannot move the 4 directly because only the top ball of a tube can be moved. However, we can first remove the top ball of tube B (which is a 5) provided we can move it somewhere that accepts color 5. Tube A is currently [5,0,0,0] (that is, its only ball is a 5) so its top is 5. The rules allow moving a ball if its color matches the top ball of the destination (or if that tube is empty). \n\nSo the solution is as follows:\nStep 1: Move the top ball from tube B to tube A.\n • After this move, tube B becomes [4,0,0,0] (its accessible (and only) ball is now 4) and tube A becomes [5,5,0,0].\nStep 2: Now move the top ball from tube B (which is 4) to tube D.\n • Tube D’s top ball is 4 so the move is allowed.

Its second (bottom) ball is a 4 but its top (accessible) ball is 5. By moving the top 5 out of tube B onto a tube with a compatible top (and tube A’s only ball is a 5) we expose the hidden 4 in tube B. (That move obeys the rule because the ball 5 from B can be placed onto tube A since A’s top ball is also 5.) Thus, the ideal first step is to move the top ball from tube B to tube A.

By moving a 4 into tube D, we complete it. Tube B contains a 4 ([4, 0, 0, 0]) so its top ball is a 4. Since the top of tube D is empty, we can legally move the ball from tube B into D. This will result in tube D becoming [4, 4, 4, 4] – a solved tube.\n\nThus, the move is to take the top ball from tube B and add it to tube D.\n\nAnswer: BD","Based on the board, tubes C, D, and F are already complete (each has four balls of the same color, 2, 4, and 1 respectively), so the remaining unsolved tubes are A, E, and G.

A legal move is to take the ball from the top of tube E (which is 5) and place it on tube A because tube A’s top ball is also 5 (and tube A isn’t full). This move “EA” will bring tube A closer to being completed with four balls of 5 (it will become [5, 5, 5, 0] after the move). \n\nAnswer: EA","I'll analyze the board step‐by‐step. Notice that tubes C, D, and F are already “solved” (each contains four balls of one color: all 2’s in C, all 4’s in D, and all 1’s in F). That means our goal of having three tubes with four balls of the same color is achieved if we eventually complete one of the remaining mixed tubes (using the others as work space).\n\nLooking at the remaining tubes:\n• Tube A: [5, 5, 5, 0] holds three 5’s.\n• Tube E: [5, 3, 3, 0] holds a 5 at the bottom but then two 3’s block it.\n• Tube G: [3, 3, 0, 0] holds two 3’s.\n\nA good idea is to free the 5 in tube E so that you can eventually complete the tube of 5’s by combining it with tube A. To do that you need to remove the two 3’s from E. In considering the moves available, note that the rules state the ball you move must land in a tube that is either empty or has a top ball of the same color. \n\nTube G’s current top is 3 (from its [3, 3, 0, 0] configuration).

With that done, tube E would be left with just the 5 (and three empty spots), making it available for later moves to combine with tube A’s three 5’s to eventually complete that color.\n\nFollowing the given instructions, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: EG","I'll analyze our board:\n\n• Tube A: [5, 5, 5, 0] → three balls (5’s) with one empty slot.\n• Tube B: [0, 0, 0, 0] → empty.\n• Tube C: [2, 2, 2, 2] → already solved (all 2’s).\n• Tube D: [4, 4, 4, 4] → already solved (all 4’s).\n• Tube E: [5, 3, 0, 0] → contains 5 at the bottom then 3 on top.\n• Tube F: [1, 1, 1, 1] → already solved (all 1’s).\n• Tube G: [3, 3, 3, 0] → three balls (3’s) with one empty slot.\n\nWe already have three solved tubes (C, D, F). Still, a beneficial move is one that builds another solved tube without disturbing the solved ones. Notice that tube G has three balls of color 3 and its top ball is 3. Meanwhile, tube E’s top ball is also a 3. According to the rule that “the ball being moved must either match the color of the ball at the top of the target tube or the target tube must be empty,” it is valid to move the top ball from tube E onto tube G.

Tube E’s top ball is 3, and the rule allows us to move from E to D because the ball being moved (3) matches the top ball on D (3). \n\nThus, the move “ED” is valid: move the top ball from tube E onto tube D.\n\nAnswer: ED","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube F to tube D. Right now tube F’s top ball is a 3 (its content is [5,6,3] ignoring the empty space) and tube D’s effective stack is [3,3] (with two empty spaces remaining). Since the ball to be moved (a 3) matches the top ball of tube D (a 3) and tube D isn’t full yet, this move is allowed according to the rules. This move will stack three 3’s in tube D, getting us one step closer to having one complete tube of four balls of the same color. \n\nAnswer: FD","One promising move is to consolidate one of the four‐color sets. Notice that color 4 appears exactly 4 times in the whole board (in tubes B, C, E, and H) and one of these (tube C) already has a 4 on top while tube H’s only ball is 4. We can move the top ball from tube C (which is 4) onto tube H (whose top ball is also 4), helping us eventually group all 4’s in one tube. This move is valid because the ball being moved (a 4) matches the top ball of the target tube (also a 4).\n\nAnswer: CH","I'll start by examining the board. For example, look at tube D. It currently contains [3, 3, 3, 0] so it’s holding three balls, all of color 3, and has one empty space. To complete a tube, we need four balls of the same color.\n\nNow look at tube C. It is [6, 1, 3, 0] so its top ball is 3. The rules allow you to move the top ball onto another tube if the top ball of the target matches the moving ball; here tube D’s top ball is 3, matching tube C’s top ball. Moreover, tube D is not full (it has only three balls), so it can accept one more ball.\n\nThus, moving the top ball from tube C (color 3) to tube D makes tube D become [3, 3, 3, 3] – that is one completed tube with four balls of the same color. Accordingly, the move is represented by the two letters indicating the source and target tubes: \"C\" for the source and \"D\" for the destination.\n\nAnswer: CD","I'll choose a move that is legal and moves us closer to collecting a complete tube.\nLooking at the board, tube B is [1, 4, 2, 6] (top = 6) and tube F is [5, 6, 0, 0] (top = 6). Because the rule requires that the ball being moved must either match the color of the target’s top ball or the tube is empty, we can move the top ball of tube B (which is 6) onto tube F (whose top is also 6). This move is legal and clears tube B (making it three balls) while adding a 6 onto F; although we’re not finishing a tube immediately, it is a step toward eventually grouping all balls of one color in a single tube.\n\nAnswer: BF","Let's consider the current setup. We note that tube A is [1, 6, 2, 2] so its top ball is a 2. Tube B is [1, 4, 2, 0] with three balls (bottom 1, then 4, then 2 on the top) and has an empty spot. One promising strategy is to start consolidating the 2’s. Across the board the four 2’s are split as follows:\n• Tube A holds two 2’s at the top (the last two entries).\n• Tube B holds one 2 at the top.\n• Tube E holds one 2 at the top.\n\nA legal move lets you move a ball onto a target tube that is either empty or whose current top ball is the same color. Here, the top ball of tube A is a 2 and the top ball of tube B is also 2; therefore, moving the top ball from A (a 2) to B is allowed. Note that tube B isn’t full yet (it only has three balls) so it will be legal to add the ball, and it will help consolidate the color2 group even though the tube might not be “solved” immediately. After the move, tube A becomes [1, 6, 2] (with its new top 2) and tube B becomes [1, 4, 2, 2]. This move is in line with our overall plan to eventually form a tube filled with four 2’s (since there are exactly 4 twos on the board).\n\nThus the selected move is to move the top ball (2) from tube A to tube B.\n\nAnswer: AB","I looked over the board carefully and noticed that the only legal “matching‐color” moves (since no tube is completely empty) are the ones that join together balls already “on top” of each tube. In fact, tubes A, B and E all have 2 as their accessible top ball. (For example, tube A is [1, 6, 2, 0] so its top ball is 2; tube B is [1, 4, 2, 2] so its top ball is 2; and tube E is [1, 4, 2, 0] so its top ball is 2.) \n\nOne strategy to eventually complete one of the solved tubes (that is, have four balls of a single color) is to start gathering together the natural “block” of 2’s. Notice that there are exactly four balls of color 2 on the board (one buried in A, two in B and one in E). Although tube B is currently full, a useful early move is to “shift” one accessible 2 from one of the almost‐empty tubes onto another that already shows a 2. \n\nAfter weighing the two alternative moves between tubes A and E, one promising option is to move the top (2) from tube E onto tube A (which already shows 2 on its top). In doing so the configuration would update as follows:\n • Tube A becomes [1, 6, 2, 2].\n • Tube E becomes [1, 4, 0, 0] (i.e. now only two balls remain).\n\nThis step helps consolidate the 2’s so that with further moves (after the one we’re asked to give) one may be able to complete a tube of all 2’s—getting one solved tube to join the tube D that already holds [3,3,3,3] and (with careful planning later) a third uniform tube.\n\nThus, according to the board and rules the move I choose is to take the top ball from tube E and move it onto tube A.\n\nAnswer: EA","Based on the rules and board situation, one promising first move is to combine the 4‐colored ball from tube E with the stack of 4’s in tube H. \n\nCurrently:\n• Tube E is [1, 4, 0, 0] with the top ball 4.\n• Tube H is [4, 4, 0, 0] with the top ball 4.\n\nSince a moved ball must match the top ball of the target tube (or the tube is empty), moving from E to H is legal. After that move:\n• Tube H becomes [4, 4, 4, 0] (three 4’s, closer to a complete set),\n• Tube E becomes [1, 0, 0, 0].\n\nThis move sets up the possibility to complete tube H with one more 4 (the missing 4 being located elsewhere on the board) so that eventually three tubes can be solved (with tube D already solved as [3, 3, 3, 3]). \n\nAnswer: EH","I looked over the board and the rules. Notice that tube D is already complete with four 3’s. To work toward a situation where three tubes are “solved” (each made up of four balls of one color), we want to set up an easy “completion‐move” for another nearly complete tube. For example, tube H has three 4’s (its configuration is [4,4,4,0]) so if later we can put a 4 on it, it would be complete. But to make future moves easier it helps to free up an entirely empty tube so that “empty‐target” moves (which allow any ball) become available. \n\nAmong the partially filled tubes only tube C ([6, 1, 0, 0]) and tube E ([1, 0, 0, 0]) have the same ball as their top (1 in each case). (Remember: full tubes cannot receive additional balls. You are only allowed to move the ball at the top of a tube, and it can only be moved onto a tube whose top ball has the same color or that is completely empty.) By moving the top ball from tube E onto tube C, we obtain an empty tube E that can be very useful in subsequent moves. (It also helps us “free up” the 1 in tube E so that we can eventually sort out the balls more easily.) \n\nThus the move “EC” (move the top ball from tube E onto tube C) is a promising next step toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: EC","I'll choose a first move that helps combine the 2’s into a new tube. Notice that tubes A and B each are full but have a 2 on top. We have an empty tube E available. By moving the top ball (a 2) from tube B into tube E (empty so the move is legal), we can later pile on more 2’s to complete one tube of four 2’s. (For example, after “BE”, you could eventually move the remaining 2’s from tubes A and B into E to create [2,2,2,2]. In addition, tube D is already completed with 3’s, and tube H (with three 4’s) can be completed by moving the top 4 from tube B.) \n\nThus, the move I propose is to move from tube B to tube E.\n\nAnswer: BE","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube A onto tube E. In tube A the top ball is a 2, and tube E already has a 2 at its bottom (it’s not empty but the top ball is 2). Since the moved ball (2) matches that top ball, this move is allowed. This helps consolidate the color‑2 balls into tube E – note that color 2 appears exactly four times (two in A, one in B, and one in E). With further moves the idea is to eventually finish assembling a tube with 4 twos (and together with tube D already filled with 3’s and one more tube from another color, you’ll have three uniform tubes).\n\nAnswer: AE","Looking at the board, one promising strategy is to build a tube of 2’s. Notice that tube E already has two 2’s ([2, 2, 0, 0]) and there is exactly one 2 in tube A ([1, 6, 2, 0]) as its top ball and one 2 in tube B ([1, 4, 2, 0]) as its top ball. Since our goal is to have a tube with four same-colored balls—and there are exactly four 2’s available—one good move is to add one of those top 2’s into tube E. \n\nFor instance, moving the top ball from tube A (which is 2) onto tube E is legal because tube E’s top ball is already a 2. This move would transform tube A to [1, 6, 0, 0] (with the top ball removed) and tube E to [2, 2, 2, 0] (now containing three 2’s). Later moves can then complete the tube of 2’s and progress toward the goal of having three homogeneous tubes.\n\nAnswer: AE","We can solve the puzzle in two moves. Notice that tube D is already complete with four 3’s. Also, tubes E and H are “almost finished” (each currently having three balls of the same color). In tube E (color 2) we have [2, 2, 2, 0] so if we add a 2 ball on top it will be complete, and in tube H (color 4) we have [4, 4, 4, 0] so adding a 4 on top completes that tube.\n\nLooking at the board, tube B holds [1, 4, 2, 0] with the top ball being 2. Thus, our first move is to move the top ball (a 2) from tube B to tube E (which already has a 2 on top). This makes tube E [2, 2, 2, 2] (completed) and leaves tube B as [1, 4, 0, 0].\n\nNow the top ball of tube B is 4. Tube H currently shows [4, 4, 4, 0] with its top ball 4. So our second move is to move the top ball (a 4) from tube B to tube H. This will complete tube H as [4, 4, 4, 4].\n\nAfter these moves, the three completed tubes are D, E, and H.\n\nThus the two moves are:\n• Move from B to E (denoted BE)\n• Move from B to H (denoted BH)\n\nAnswer: BE BH","I'll describe my reasoning. Currently tube D is already full with four 3’s. We can aim to complete two more tubes.\n\nLook at tube E. It holds [2,2,2,0] (three 2’s, with an empty slot on top). In tube B we see a top ball “2” in [1,4,2,0]. Since the top of E is 2, moving the 2 from B onto E is allowed. That move (from B to E) fills E with four 2’s.\n\nAfter that move tube B becomes [1,4,0,0] (now its top ball is 4) and tube H is [4,4,4,0] (three 4’s). The top of H is 4 so moving the top ball “4” from tube B (which now is 4) to tube H is allowed. That move fills tube H with four 4’s.\n\nNow we have three uniform tubes (D, E, H). \n\nThus my move sequence is: first “BE”, then “BH”.\n\nAnswer: BE BH","I'll examine the tubes and look for one that is nearly complete. Tube E has three balls of color 2 (its contents are [2, 2, 2, 0]). To complete it, I need to add one more \"2\" ball on top. I see that tube B’s top ball is a 2 (tube B is [1, 4, 2, 0]). Since the rule allows moving a ball onto a tube if that ball’s color matches the top of the target (or the target is empty), I can move the 2 from tube B to tube E. That move will fill tube E with four balls of color 2, which is one of our goal tubes.\n\nAnswer: BE","The easiest way to get a tube with four balls of the same color is to complete tube H, which already contains three 4’s ([4, 4, 4, 0]). Tube B’s top ball is 4 (since its contents [1, 4, 0, 0] have 4 as the only non-empty top), so moving that ball onto tube H is legal because the ball matches the top of tube H and there’s exactly one space left. That move will result in tube H becoming [4, 4, 4, 4], which, together with the already complete tubes D ([3, 3, 3, 3]) and E ([2, 2, 2, 2]), gives us three tubes each with four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: BH","I'll choose to move the top ball of tube B (which is a 1) onto tube C, whose top ball is also 1.

Currently, tube A is [1, 6, 0, 0] (so its top ball is 6) and tube B is empty. By moving the top ball from A to B, tube A will become [1, 0, 0, 0] (its only ball becomes 1), which “opens up” A so it can later receive more 1’s (for example, from tube C where the top three balls are 1’s) to form a complete tube of four 1’s.\n\nThe move “A to B” is allowed because tube B is empty.

Tube A already has a 1 at the top (its only ball), and tube C’s top ball is also a 1. Since the destination (tube A) is not full and its top ball matches the moving ball’s color, the move is legal.

Tube A is [1, 1, 0, 0] (its available capacity is 2 and its top ball is a 1) and tube C is [6, 1, 1, 0] (its available capacity is 1 and its top ball is also a 1). Since the move rule allows us to put a ball onto a tube whose top ball is the same color, we can move the top 1 from tube C onto tube A.

Since the rules allow us to move a ball onto a tube whose top ball is the same color (or if it’s empty), we can move the top ball from tube B (which is a 6) onto tube G. This move is legal because tube G’s top is a 6 and it has space. After that move, tube G becomes [6, 6, 6, 6]—a complete tube of four 6’s, one of the three targets we need to achieve.\n\nThus, the move is represented by the two letters “BG” – meaning we take the top ball from tube B and place it onto tube G.\n\nAnswer: BG","Let's consider the board and the rules carefully. One promising idea is to start building one of the tubes that can eventually become homogeneous. Notice that tube H already contains two 2’s (it is [2,2,0,0]). Since every color appears exactly four times on the board (and tube G is already full with 6’s), one natural target is to consolidate all 2’s into tube H. The occurrences of 2 are:\n• Tube A has a 2 on the bottom (but it is blocked by two 5’s on top).\n• Tube E has a 2 as its top ball (its state is [3,1,2,0]).\n• Tube H already shows two 2’s.\n\nSince the rules allow moving a ball onto a tube if its top ball is of the same color, we can use tube H as our target. Tube E’s top ball is 2, and tube H’s top ball is 2 as well. Therefore, we can move the top ball from tube E onto tube H. In our notation that move is represented by the two letters “EH” (meaning move from tube E to tube H).\n\nThus, following the rules and aiming to work toward a tube with four 2’s, the best move is:\n\nAnswer: EH","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube D to tube C. Here's my reasoning:\n\n• Look at tube D: [1, 3, 4, 4] is full with the top ball 4.  \n• Tube C is [5, 4, 0, 0] and has room. Its top (highest filled) ball is 4.  \n• Since the ball 4 from tube D matches the top ball of tube C, this move is allowed.\n\nThis move (denoted “DC”) helps free up tube D (making it no longer full) so that we can later work on gathering a complete set of one color in a tube (for example, planning to eventually complete one tube with four 4’s, or work on other colors).\n\nAnswer: DC","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube E (which is a 1) onto tube B. Tube B already has a 1 on top (its only ball), so the move is legal. This has the advantage of starting to consolidate the four 1’s (recall there are exactly four 1’s in play—in tubes A, B, D, and E) in one tube, one step toward eventually forming one of the solved tubes. \n\nAnswer: EB","I’ve looked over the board and found a legal move that moves a 4 from a tube that already has a 4 on top. In tube C the top ball is 4 (from [5,4,4,0]) and tube D’s current top is also 4 (from [1,3,4,0]) and it has room for one more ball. According to the rules you can only move a ball onto a tube whose top ball is the same color (or if the tube is empty). Therefore, moving the top ball from tube C to tube D (a move stated as “CD”) is a valid step.\n\nAnswer: CD","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube F (which is a 4) onto tube C. Tube C’s top ball is also a 4, so this move is allowed. After the move, tube F becomes [3, 3, 5, 0] (with the 4 removed) and tube C becomes [5, 4, 4, 0]. This not only follows the rule of only placing a ball on an empty tube or onto a ball of the same color but also helps in clearing an obstructing ball so that eventually we can complete a tube with four identical balls.\n\nAnswer: FC","I'll examine the board. Notice that tube G is already full with four 6’s. That gives us one complete tube. Next we look for a candidate tube that is nearly complete for one color. For example, tube H has three 2’s (i.e. [2,2,2,0]) and is in need of one more 2 to become complete. The only other 2 is in tube A (its bottom ball), but it is inaccessible until we clear the top balls of tube A. In tube A ([2, 1, 5, 5]), the top two balls are 5’s. To start unblocking tube A we need to move a top ball. \n\nMoving the top 5 from tube A must follow the move rules. We can only move a ball if the target’s top ball has the same color or if the target tube is completely empty (and here none is fully empty). Checking the tubes that are not full, tube F is [3, 3, 5, 0] with top ball 5. Thus, moving the top ball (5) from tube A onto tube F is legal.\n\nThis move (from tube A to tube F, abbreviated “AF”) is our answer.\n\nAnswer: AF","I'll propose moving the top ball from tube F onto tube A. \n\nCurrently, tube F is [3, 3, 5, 5] so its top ball is 5, and tube A is [2, 1, 5, 0] with 3 balls already (its top ball is 5). Since the rules allow moving a ball if it matches the top ball of the target tube and tube A isn’t full, this move is legal. Moving the 5 from F to A will change tube A to [2, 1, 5, 5] and tube F to [3, 3, 5, 0], which can help work toward grouping the balls by color.\n\nAnswer: FA","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube D onto tube C. Right now, tube D is [1, 3, 4, 4] (with 4 at its top) and tube C is [5, 4, 4, 0] (with 4 as its top ball, since the zero indicates an empty slot). Since the ball we move (a 4 from D) matches the top ball of tube C, the move is legal. This move also helps free tube D so that we can eventually expose the lower balls (like the 1 at the bottom) and work toward forming tubes with four balls of the same color (remember that our goal is to have three tubes fully homogeneous). \n\nAnswer: DC","I'll analyze the board. Remember that each tube is written with the bottom ball first and the top ball last, and you can only move the top ball onto a tube whose top ball is the same color or which is empty.

Why?\n– The top ball of tube A is 5.\n– Tube F’s top ball is also 5, and tube F has one empty space.\nThus the rules are satisfied.\n\nAfter this move:\n• Tube A becomes [2, 1, 5] (with top ball now 5 still) and\n• Tube F becomes [3, 3, 5, 5] (now fully holding four balls).\n\nThis move helps clear tube A so that eventually the lower balls (such as the 1 and the 2) become accessible for future moves toward completing a uniform tube grouping.\n\nTherefore, my move is to move from tube A to tube F.\n\nAnswer: AF","I'll analyze the board. Each tube is shown bottom‐to–top (with 0 as an empty space). For example, tube A is [2, 1, 5, 0] meaning it currently has three balls (2 at bottom, then 1, then 5 on top) and one free space.\n\nA valid move is to take the top ball from one tube and add it on top of another tube that is either empty or whose current top ball is the same color as the moving ball. One promising move is from tube F to tube A:\n\n• Tube F is [3, 3, 5, 5] (full) so its top ball is 5.\n• Tube A is [2, 1, 5, 0] (with three balls) and its current top ball (last filled position) is also 5.\n• Moving the top ball from F onto A is allowed because the moving ball (5) matches the top ball of A. Also, A has exactly one empty space remaining.\n\nThus, the move from tube F to tube A is legal.\n\nAnswer: FA","One useful move is to take the top ball from tube C and place it onto tube D. In tube C the top ball is a 4 and tube D’s top ball is also a 4 (with an empty slot available), so the move “from C to D” is legal according to the rules.\n\nAnswer: CD","I'll analyze the board. For example, note that tube D shows [1, 3, 4, 4] (with its top ball being a 4) and tube C shows [5, 4, 4, 0] (with its top – the last non‐zero – being a 4). Since one of the allowed moves is to move a top ball onto a tube whose top is the same color, we can move the top ball from tube D (a 4) onto tube C’s top. (Also, tube C has space.) This move obeys the rules.\n\nAnswer: DC","I'll analyze the board first. The tubes are listed from A through H. Their contents (from bottom to top) and effective state (ignoring zeros) are:\n\n• A: [2, 1, 5, 5] (full; top ball = 5)\n• B: [1, 1, 0, 0] (two balls; top ball = 1)\n• C: [5, 4, 4, 4] (full; top ball = 4)\n• D: [1, 3, 4, 0] (three balls; top ball = 4)\n• E: [3, 0, 0, 0] (one ball; top ball = 3)\n• F: [3, 3, 5, 0] (three balls; top ball = 5)\n• G: [6, 6, 6, 6] (full and already uniform; top ball = 6)\n• H: [2, 2, 2, 0] (three balls; top ball = 2)\n\nRecall the moving rule: when moving the top ball from one tube to another, the destination tube must either be empty or its current top ball must be of the same color as the ball being moved. (Also, moves into a full tube are not allowed.)\n\nA promising pair of matching top colors is found in tubes C and D (both have 4 at the top). However, we can’t move from D to C because tube C is full, but we can move the top ball from tube C onto tube D. (Tube D has three balls so it can accept one more ball and its top is 4, which matches the ball being moved from tube C.) \n\nPerforming move “CD”:\n– Remove the top ball (color 4) from tube C, leaving C with [5, 4, 4] (3 balls left, top remains 4).\n– Add that ball to tube D, which then becomes [1, 3, 4, 4] (now full).\n\nThis move complies with the rules and helps in a sequence of moves that would eventually allow three tubes to be filled with four balls of a single color. \n\nAnswer: CD","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube D onto tube C. In tube D the top ball is a 4, and in tube C the top ball is also a 4. This move is allowed because the color being moved (4) matches the color at the top of the target tube. With this move, tube D will lose its top 4 (becoming [1, 3, 4, 0]) and tube C will gain a 4 (becoming [5, 4, 4, 4]), getting one step closer to a tube of four 4’s.\n\nAnswer: DC","The key idea we use is to “free” tube A so that its bottom‐ball (a “2”) can eventually be used to complete tube H which already has three “2”s. In tube A the order (from bottom to top) is 2, 1, 5, 5. We cannot get to the “2” until the three balls on top are moved somewhere legally. The only place to put a 5 (the top ball of A) is onto a tube whose top is already 5 or that is completely empty. Looking at the board from the start, tube F is not full and its top ball is a 5 (tube F is [3, 3, 5, 0] meaning it contains three balls: 3, 3, and 5). Therefore, the first legal move is to take the top ball (a 5) from tube A and move it onto tube F. (In the move notation we use “AF” – meaning from tube A to tube F.)\n\nThis move helps start “freeing” tube A so that ultimately its bottom ball (the 2) can be uncovered and moved to tube H; a step toward having three tubes complete with four balls of the same color (tube H with 2’s and the already‐complete tube G with 6’s, with one more to come).\n\nAnswer: AF","I'll choose the move from tube C to tube D. In tube C the top ball is a 4, and tube D’s top is also a 4 (and it isn’t full), so moving the 4 from C onto D is legal. This move groups more 4’s together, which is a promising step toward getting one tube fully filled with color 4 (and along with the already completed color‐6 tube in G and one other nearly complete tube, you’ll have three uniform tubes).\n\nAnswer: CD","I'll choose to move the top ball of tube D (which is 4) onto tube C. In tube C the current top ball is also 4 (since tube C is [5, 4, 4, 0]), so the move is legal. This move helps concentrate the 4’s—one of the colors that appears exactly four times on the board—so that eventually one tube can become a homogeneous tube (in addition to tube G that’s already complete with 6’s, and the nearly completed tube H of 2’s). \n\nThus, the move is from tube D onto tube C.\n\nAnswer: DC","I'll explain my reasoning. Looking at the board we have eight tubes labeled A–H. One tube (G) is already “completed” with four 6’s. We need to end up with a total of three tubes that each hold four balls of a single color. (Other colors also occur exactly four times overall.) One promising candidate is the set of 4’s because tube C already contains four balls (reading bottom‐to‐top, it is [5, 4, 4, 4]) with three 4’s on top (though the bottom ball is a 5). One way to start handling the “impurity” in tube C is to remove its top ball if it can be “stacked” somewhere. \n\nRecall the rule: you can only move a ball from the top of one tube onto another tube if the target tube’s top ball has the same color or if the target tube is completely empty. For tube C, the top ball is a 4. Looking at the board, tube D currently shows [1, 3, 4, 0] (which really means it holds three balls: 1 then 3 then 4, with an empty slot available at the top). Its visible top ball is 4. Since the ball to be moved from C is a 4 and tube D’s top is 4, the move is allowed.\n\nThus, the legal move is to take the top ball (a 4) from tube C and drop it onto tube D. This move (denoted by the letters “CD”) is a valid step toward eventually regrouping balls so that three tubes – including tube G with 6’s – end with four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: CD","I looked for a move that uses the matching‐color rule. Notice that Tube D is full ([1, 3, 4, 4]) with a top ball of 4 and Tube C ([5, 4, 4, 0]) is almost full but has room—with its top ball being 4. By moving the top ball (a 4) from D to C, the move is legal because the ball’s color (4) matches Tube C’s top ball, and Tube C is not full. This gives:\n\n• Tube D becomes [1, 3, 4]  \n• Tube C becomes [5, 4, 4, 4]\n\nThis move helps in progressing toward eventually having three tubes with four same-colored balls (with Tube G already solved as [6,6,6,6]). \n\nAnswer: DC","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube C onto tube D. In tube C (which is [5,4,4,4]), the top ball is 4, and tube D (which is [1,3,4,0]) currently has 4 on its top.

Why?\n • Tube F’s top ball is 5.\n • Tube A’s accessible (top) ball is 5 (since A’s sequence is 2, 1, 5 from bottom upward).\n • Tube A is not full, so it can accept a ball.\nSince the ball being moved (5) matches the top ball of A (5), this move is legal.\n\nThus, the two-letter move is: first letter is the source (F) and second letter is the target (A).\n\nAnswer: FA","I'll move the top ball from tube A (which is a 5) onto tube F (whose top ball is also 5 and isn’t full), making that move legal.\n\nAnswer: AF","I analyzed the board carefully and found one legal move that “follows‐the rule” – moving a ball from a tube with a top ball that matches the target’s top ball.

Because the ball being moved must match the destination tube’s top ball (or go into an empty tube), moving the top 5 from tube A onto tube F is legal. This move (written as “AF”) will remove the top ball from tube A (making it [2, 1, 5]) and complete tube F as [3, 3, 5, 5].

Tube D is full with [1, 3, 4, 4] so its top ball is a 4. Tube C is not full (it has one empty slot) and its current content is [5, 4, 4, 0] – its top ball (the rightmost nonzero) is also 4. Moving the top ball 4 from tube D onto tube C is legal because the colors match. (After that move tube C becomes [5, 4, 4, 4] and tube D becomes [1, 3, 4, 0]. Although none of the tubes is solved yet, the move moves us closer to the goal of eventually having three tubes with four balls of one color each.)\n\nThus the move is indicated by the two letters “DC” (meaning “move the top ball from tube D onto tube C”).\n\nAnswer: DC","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube F onto tube A. In tube F the top ball is a 5, and tube A’s top (the current visible ball) is also a 5. Since the rule requires that the ball moved either match the top ball of the receiving tube or the tube be empty, this move is allowed. After the move, tube A will have four balls (its new configuration being [2, 1, 5, 5]), and tube F will lose its top ball (its new configuration being [3, 3, 5, 0]). This move helps in our plan to eventually have three tubes each filled with four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: FA","I'll choose to move the ball on tube A onto tube F. In detail, tube A is [2, 1, 5, 5] so its top ball is 5. Tube F is [3, 3, 5, 0] (three balls already) whose top ball is 5. Since the ball being moved (5) matches the top of tube F—and tube F has free space—the move is legal. This move begins to group the four 5’s (one in tube C as well) so that eventually one of the tubes can be completed with four balls of color 5.\n\nAnswer: AF","I analyzed the board and noticed that tube G already is complete (all 6’s). Among the “almost complete” tubes, tube H (with three 2’s) is a good candidate to finish as a homogeneous tube—but to add a 2 there we’d have to expose the 2 in tube A. (Right now tube A contains [2,1,5,0], with its top ball 5 “blocking” the bottom‐2.) One reasonable idea is to “uncover” tube A’s lower ball by moving a ball from somewhere else. In the current configuration one legal move that contributes toward eventually reaching our goal is to move the top ball from tube F to tube A. (Tube F’s configuration is [3,3,5,5] so its top ball is 5; tube A’s top ball is 5 so the rule is satisfied, and tube A isn’t full.) After this move the tubes become:\n\n • A: [2,1,5,5]          (full)\n • F: [3,3,5,0]          (not full)\n\nThis move “uses” the only legal move that will help eventually free the bottom ball in tube A (the 2) so that tube H can later be completed into [2,2,2,2]. \n\nThus my answer is to move the top ball from tube F onto tube A.\n\nAnswer: FA","I'll start by examining the board. Notice that tube G is already “completed” with 6’s (G: [6,6,6,6]). In order to finish three tubes (each having four balls of one color), one strategy is to work so that one other color (or two) eventually gets grouped into a tube. A useful first step is to help free balls from congested tubes. For example, look at tube A which is full with [2, 1, 5, 5] so its top ball is 5; and tube F is not full ([3, 3, 5, 0]) and its top ball is 5. According to the rules if the ball you move matches the target’s top ball, the move is legal. Therefore moving the top ball 5 from tube A to tube F is allowed since tube F’s top is 5 (and it has an empty slot).\n\nAfter that move tube A becomes [2, 1, 5, 0] (three balls remaining) and tube F becomes [3, 3, 5, 5]. This move creates extra free space in tube A so you may eventually extract its lower balls (and, for example, work toward completing tube H with the color 2 or any other grouping you wish) while keeping legal moves.\n\nThus, with this move, the answer expressed as two letters is \"AF\".\n\nAnswer: AF","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube C onto tube D. \n\nHere's the reasoning in short:\n• In tube C the top ball is a 4 and tube C currently holds [5,4,4,4].  \n• Tube D has [1,3,4,0] so its top ball is a 4 and it isn’t full yet.  \nSince the moving ball (4) matches D’s current top ball (4), the move “CD” is legal. This move starts toward consolidating one of the colors into a tube of four identical balls (with color 4 coming from both C and D), which is one of the three target tubes.\n\nAnswer: CD","We can start by “stacking” the 4‐balls. Notice that tube D has 4 (its top ball is 4) and tube C’s current top ball (ignoring empty spaces) is also 4. Since tube C [5,4,4,0] is not full and its top ball is 4, the rules allow us to move the top ball from D onto C. (This is one step in a longer solution leading eventually to three tubes that each hold four balls of the same color.) \n\nThus, the move is to take the top ball from tube D and place it on tube C.\n\nAnswer: DC","I'll analyze the board first. Every tube holds four slots (with 0’s indicating empties) so only tubes with a “0” are not full. (A, B, D, E and H have a free space.) According to the rules you may only move the top (right‐most) ball from one tube to a target tube that has a top ball of the same color or is completely empty. (No tube here is completely empty.)\n\nLabeling each tube with its (bottom … top) content and “current top ball” (the very right nonzero digit):\n • A: [2, 1, 5, 0] → top ball = 5\n • B: [1, 1, 0, 0] → top ball = 1\n • C: [5, 4, 4, 4] → top ball = 4   (note: tube C is full)\n • D: [1, 3, 4, 0] → top ball = 4\n • E: [3, 0, 0, 0] → top ball = 3\n • F: [3, 3, 5, 5] → top ball = 5   (tube F is full)\n • G: [6, 6, 6, 6] → already “solved” (all 6’s)\n • H: [2, 2, 2, 0] → top ball = 2   (almost solved – it has three 2’s and one slot free; if a 2 is added it becomes uniform)\n\nOne promising “one‐move‐ahead” candidate is tube H because it needs one more ball 2 to be complete. However, the only legal moves require the ball moved to match the target’s current top color (here 2) and unfortunately none of the tubes (aside from H itself) have 2 on top.\n\nThere is another legal chance. Look at the two tubes whose top ball is 5. Tube A (free slot) has top ball 5 and tube F (full) has top ball 5. (Even though tube F is full the rule can be applied in the reverse direction if the target has space.) We can legally move the top ball from tube F (a 5) onto tube A (whose top is 5). In notation that move is indicated by the two letters “FA” – meaning “move from tube F to tube A.” Even though this single move does not immediately “solve” a tube, it is the legal move provided by the puzzle (with one legal two‐letter move as answer) on a board that is partway toward reaching the goal of having three tubes completely uniform.\n\nThus, my answer (first as a letter pair and then in the required format) is:\n\nAnswer: FA","I’ll choose to start by taking the top ball from tube A (which is a 5) and moving it onto tube F.

This move is legal under the rules and begins the process of “freeing” tube A so that its lower‐balls (in particular the 1 and then the bottom 2) may come to the top. In the overall plan the nearly completed tube H (with three 2’s) can later be finished by exposing and then moving the only extra 2 (currently buried in tube A) toward it, while the “1” balls (two already in tube B and one in tube D plus the one freed from A) can ultimately be gathered to complete another target tube with color 1.

In detail, tube F’s top ball is a 5 and tube A’s top ball is also a 5. (Recall that when a tube isn’t empty you may only add a ball if its color matches that of the current top ball; here both are 5.) This move is legal, and although it does not complete a “solved” tube immediately, it does help to “unlock” the configuration for later steps toward having three tubes full of a single color.

(In our “water sort”–style puzzle the idea is to expose the lower balls so that one day you can form a complete tube of a given color.) In this situation the top ball of tube F is a 5 and the top ball of tube A is also a 5. (Remember that tube A, although not full, already has a 5 at its top.) Since tube A is not “full” yet (its list is [2, 1, 5, 0] so there is one free spot on top) we are allowed to move from F onto A if the moved ball matches the ball already at the top of A. (Exchanging the top ball from one tube to an “open‐slot” tube is legal provided the target is empty or the top ball matches the moved ball.) \n\nSo the move is to take the top ball (a 5) from tube F and put it onto tube A. (We denote a move by two letters: the “from” tube and the “to” tube.) This move—in notation—is “FA.”\n\nThus, based on the rules and our board, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: FA","We can only make one legal move (a one‐ball transfer) according to the rule that the ball must be placed on a tube whose current top ball is the same color (unless the tube is empty). Checking all tubes, two moves turn out to be legal. For example, tube A’s top ball is a 5 and tube F’s top ball is also a 5 – so moving the top ball from A into F (“AF”) is a legal move. Also, note that tube C is full and its top ball is 4 while tube D (which holds three balls) has a top 4. Thus moving the top ball from C into D (“CD”) is legal. (A quick look at the other tubes shows no other legal moves.)\n\nIn this level the “target” configuration is to have three tubes that are completely solved (that is, contain exactly four balls all of the same color). One tube is already solved (tube G with four 6’s) and one promising set of balls is the four 4’s that appear on tubes C and D. In tube C the 4’s are already at the top (except for a stray 5 at its bottom) while tube D has a 4 at its top. By pouring the top 4 from tube C into tube D we are “merging” these groups of 4’s so that eventually one of them may be rearranged to form a complete tube of 4’s. (Even though after this single move no tube besides G is yet uniform, “CD” is the move that makes progress toward creating a solved tube.)\n\nThus, the answer we choose is the two‐letter move “CD” (i.e. move the top ball from tube C onto tube D).\n\nAnswer: CD","I analyzed the board and noted that tube A’s top ball is a 5 and tube F’s top ball is also a 5. Since tube F currently has three balls (its fourth slot is empty) and its top ball is 5, we can legally move the top ball from A onto F. This move is allowed because the ball being moved (5) matches the color of the top ball in tube F, and tube F is not full. So the move is from tube A to tube F.\n\nAnswer: AF","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube D onto tube C. On tube D, the top ball is 4, and on tube C the top (visible) ball is also 4; additionally, tube C isn’t full because its fourth slot is empty.

After the move, tube D becomes [1, 3, 4] (with its previous top 4 removed) and tube C becomes [5, 4, 4, 4]. With tube G already solved ([6,6,6,6]) and tube H nearly solved ([2,2,2,0]), this move helps set up the board so that eventually three tubes can have four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: DC","I'll choose a move that helps reveal a ball that can later complete one of the near‐uniform tubes. In this case, consider tube F which is [3, 3, 5, 5]. Its top ball is a 5. Tube A is [2, 1, 5, 0] so its highest filled position shows a 5. Because the moving ball must either match the target’s top ball or go into an empty tube, it is legal to move the top ball 5 from F onto tube A. (Also, tube A isn’t full yet.) This move is written with the source first and target second, so the move is “FA.”\n\nAnswer: FA","I'll choose a move that both obeys the rule and frees a spot for later organizing the colors. Notice that tube C is completely full with [5,4,4,4] and its top ball is 4; tube D holds [1,3,4,0] so its top ball (the current ball at the highest filled slot) is 4 as well and it isn’t full. Thus moving the top ball from C onto D is legal (since the moving ball’s color 4 matches the top ball of D) and it also “frees” a space in C so that further re‐arrangements can be made to eventually complete one color tube. \n\nSo the move is: Move the top ball from tube C onto tube D. \n\nAnswer: CD","After considering the available moves, the only legal moves are to pour the top ball from a full tube into a non‐full tube when its top matches in color. In this board the only two legal moves are moving the top ball from A (a 5) to F (whose top is 5) or from D (a 4) to C (with top 4). (Remember that tubes already full cannot accept another ball.) \n\nAmong these, moving the 4 from tube D to tube C consolidates the fours (tube D holds two 4’s and tube C holds two 4’s after its initial move—aside from extra balls). Even though the board isn’t “solved” immediately, this move sets the stage so that by subsequent moves it is possible to end up with three tubes completely filled with the same color. In our notation the move “from tube D to tube C” is indicated by the two letters “DC”.\n\nAnswer: DC","I looked at the board and noted that tube H already has three “2”s (it is [2,2,2,0]) and so would form a uniform tube of “2”s if only one additional “2” were added. The only place a “2” lives is at the bottom of tube A ([2, 1, 5, 5]), but that “2” is currently buried under two “5”s and a “1”. In order to eventually access that “2” we must “clear” the top of tube A.\n\nThe very first legal move is to remove the “5” that is sitting on top of tube A. (Remember, you may only move the ball at the top of a tube.) Where can a “5” legally go? It must be placed either on an empty tube or atop a tube whose top ball is also a “5”. Although no tube is completely empty, tube F shows promise—it is [3,3,5,0] so its current top ball is 5 (since it has three balls) and it isn’t full.\n\nThus, the move is to pour the “5” from tube A onto tube F. In two‐letter notation this is “AF” (move from tube A into tube F). This is the first step toward eventually exposing the “2” at the bottom of A so that tube H can be completed.\n\nAnswer: AF","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube C onto tube D. \n\nExplanation:\n• In tube C, the top ball is a 4 (its configuration is [5, 4, 4, 4]).\n• Tube D currently shows [1, 3, 4, 0]; its top (non‐empty) ball is 4.\n• Since the moving ball (4) matches the color of the top ball in tube D, the move obeys the rule.\n• This move is a valid step toward eventually consolidating a tube with four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: CD","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube F to tube A. In tube F the top ball is 5, and tube A’s top ball is also 5 (with an empty slot available), so the move F → A is legal.\n\nAnswer: FA","I analyzed the board and found one promising “first‐move” that obeys the rules. In tube A you have [2, 1, 5, 5] (with 5 at the top) and in tube F you have [3, 3, 5, 0]—so F’s top ball is a 5. That means you can take the top ball (a 5) from tube A and put it on F (because the ball you’re moving matches the ball at the top of F). (Recall that an empty “slot” at a tube’s top is treated as empty; here F already has balls so it must match, and 5 does.) \n\nMaking the move A→F changes the tubes as follows:\n• Tube A becomes [2, 1, 5, 0] (its top ball is now the remaining 5).\n• Tube F becomes [3, 3, 5, 5] (now holding two 5’s at its top).\n\nThis move is one step in the larger plan of isolating the four-of-a-kind tubes. (For example, one could aim to eventually complete tube H—already nearly full with three 2’s—by using the only remaining color-2 ball (buried in A), and similarly, fill tube B to complete the four 1’s; tube G is already solved with four 6’s.) \n\nThus, following the game’s prescribed format the answer is:\n\nAnswer: AF","I'll start by checking which move is legal. Notice that tube D is full ([1, 3, 4, 4]) with its top ball being a 4. Tube C ([5, 4, 4, 0]) has its top ball equal to 4 (the fourth slot is empty so the highest ball is the third, which is 4). The rules require that when moving a ball its color must match the color of the ball on top of the target tube (or the tube must be empty). So moving the top ball (4) from tube D onto tube C is a legal move, since tube C’s top ball is 4.\n\nThis move (from D to C) then changes the tubes as follows:\n• Tube D becomes [1, 3, 4, 0] (the top 4 is removed).\n• Tube C becomes [5, 4, 4, 4].\n\nAlthough this move does not complete a uniform tube immediately, it is a sound step toward eventually grouping one of the colors into a tube of four identical balls (remember that your goal is to end up with three tubes each containing exactly four balls of the same color – with tube G already complete as [6, 6, 6, 6]). \n\nThus, the move is indicated by two letters: the source tube (D) and the target tube (C).\n\nAnswer: DC","I'll analyze the board quickly. We need to end up with three tubes that have four balls of the same color (one of them is already finished: tube G with four “6”s).

On the other hand, consider tube F, which is [3, 3, 5, 5] (full) and tube A, which is [2, 1, 5, 0] (with just three balls). Both have “5” at the top. Since a move is allowed when the ball being moved has the same color as the top ball of the receiving tube (and the target isn’t full), one promising move is to take the top ball (a 5) from F and put it on top of tube A. After that move:\n• Tube A becomes [2, 1, 5, 5] (adding a 5 on top) \n• Tube F becomes [3, 3, 5]\nThis move groups same‐colored balls (the “5”s) together and clears tube F of one ball.

One observation is that tube G is already “solved” as it holds [6, 6, 6, 6]. We must eventually form two additional solved tubes – that is, tubes filled with exactly four balls all of the same color.

In an ideal finish we want it to become [2, 2, 2, 2]. However, to add a 2 on top, we would need a tube whose top ball is 2. (A ball may be moved only from its tube’s top.) Looking down the board, no tube shows a 2 on top at the moment.\n\nAnother possibility is to “build” one of the final color groups from the four balls of a given color in the whole board. Look, for instance, at color 4. There are exactly four 4’s, two sitting on top of tube D ([1, 3, 4, 4]) and two in tube C (which currently is [5, 4, 4, 0]). Since moves require that the moving ball matches the destination’s top color, a natural move is to use one of the available 4’s so that one tube will soon have all four 4’s. \n\nNotice that tube D’s top ball is a 4 and tube C’s top ball is also 4. Although tube C isn’t “solved” yet (because its bottom ball is 5 rather than 4), combining these 4’s is the first step toward eventually “cleaning up” that tube.

(This is legal because the moving ball’s color, 4, matches the target’s top, 4, and tube D isn’t yet full.) Although many moves must eventually be made to achieve three tubes that are “solved” (each with four balls of the same color), the natural first move here is to “clear” tube D by adding one extra 4 onto it.\n\nSo the move is to take the top ball from tube C and put it on tube D. \n\nAnswer: CD","We can “see” that only a couple of moves are legal from the initial configuration. (Remember that only the upper‐most ball in any tube may be moved and that the ball being moved must “match” the top ball of its destination – unless the destination tube is completely empty – and none of our tubes is entirely empty.) In our case the accessible tops are\n\n  A: 5  B: 1  C: 4  D: 4  E: 3  F: 5  G: 6  H: 2\n\nThus the only moves available are to move a “5” from one tube to a tube with top 5 (that is, either move from F to A or from A to F) or to move a “4” from one tube to a tube with top 4 (namely, from D to C or vice‐versa). \n\nIn this level the “4”–move is especially promising. Notice that tube D is full (its four balls are [1, 3, 4, 4]) while tube C holds three balls: [5, 4, 4] (with top 4). By moving the top ball from D (a 4) onto C we get\n\n  Tube D becomes [1, 3, 4]  (top ball 4), \n  Tube C becomes [5, 4, 4, 4]  (full, top ball 4).\n\nAlthough tube C is not yet “solved” because it still has that stray 5 at the bottom, this move is part of the plan. (In the overall puzzle the counts work out so that the four balls of color 1, or of color 2, or of color 3, or of color 4, are exactly present. In particular, you already have tube G completely filled with 6’s, and if you can eventually separate the 4’s from the unwanted ball in tube C then you win.) \n\nThus a good move to start is to move the top ball from tube D to tube C.\n\nAnswer: DC","One sensible move is to transfer the top ball from tube F to tube A. Initially, tube F shows [3, 3, 5, 5] with 5 at the top and tube A shows [2, 1, 5, 0] with its top (the highest non‐empty ball) being 5. Since the moved ball (5) matches the top ball of tube A and tube A has a free slot, this move is legal and moves us a step closer toward eventually grouping four balls of the same color into a tube.\n\nAnswer: FA","I analyzed the board and the legal moves. Reviewing the tubes:\n\n• Tube A holds [2, 1, 5, 5] so its top ball is 5.\n• Tube F holds [3, 3, 5, 0] so its top ball is 5 (and it has one free spot).\n\nBecause when moving a ball the rule is that its color must match the color of the top ball in the target tube (or the target must be completely empty) and the target must not be full, the only legal move available is to take the top ball from tube A (which is 5) and put it onto tube F (whose top is 5). This move is perfectly legal and makes progress toward eventually grouping colors (so that eventually three tubes become solved).\n\nThus, the move is from tube A to tube F.\n\nAnswer: AF","I examined the board carefully. One promising idea is to help group the color‐5 balls. Notice that tube A (showing 2, 1, 5, 0) has three balls and its top (the third ball) is a 5. Also, tube F (displaying 3, 3, 5, 5) is full and its top two balls are both 5. Since a move is permitted if the ball to be moved (here a 5 from tube F) matches the current top ball of the destination (here tube A’s current top of 5), we can take the top 5 from tube F and place it on tube A. (Remember that an “empty” destination means a tube has no balls at all—but here a tube with space is allowed only if its current top ball matches the ball we want to add.) \n\nAfter this move, tube F will have one empty space, revealing a new top ball (which will then be the remaining 5), and tube A becomes [2, 1, 5, 5]. In later moves the goal will be to remove mismatches from tubes so that eventually three of the tubes contain 4 balls of a single color. (Tube G is already a complete tube of 6’s, and grouping the 5’s is a natural next target.) \n\nThus the move is to move the top ball from tube F onto tube A.\n\nAnswer: FA","I'll make the following move:\nMove the top ball from tube A onto tube F.\nChecking the rules: Tube A’s top is 5 and tube F’s top is also 5, and tube F isn’t full (it currently has three balls). Thus the move “AF” is legal and helps work toward the goal of ultimately forming three tubes of four same‐colored balls (with tube G already complete).\n\nAnswer: AF","I'll examine the current configuration. For example, look at tube C:\n • Tube C: [5, 4, 4, 4] (reading from bottom to top). Its top ball is 4.\nAnd tube D:\n • Tube D: [1, 3, 4, 0] – it’s a three‐ball tube whose top ball is 4.\nSince a moved ball must match the existing top ball (unless the tube is completely empty) and tube D is not full, we have a legal move by transferring the 4 at the top of tube C (from tube C) onto tube D. This move is indicated by the two letters “CD” (moving from C to D) and it is a sensible step toward grouping same‐colored balls into uniform tubes.\n\nAnswer: CD","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube D to tube C. In tube D the top ball is a 4, and tube C’s top ball is also 4 (and tube C isn’t full), so this move is allowed by the rules. This move also helps begin the process toward forming tubes with four balls of the same color.\n\nAnswer: DC","I examined the board and looked for a “one‐move” option that obeys the rule (you can only move the top ball into a tube that isn’t already full if its current top ball matches the moving ball’s color—or the tube is empty). Of the non‐full tubes (A, B, D, E, and H), you must choose a move in which the source’s top ball “fits” onto the target’s top ball.\n\nTwo moves are legal. For instance, tube F is full ([3, 3, 5, 5]), and its top ball is 5. Tube A is not full (currently [2, 1, 5, 0]); furthermore its top ball (the ball already at its top) is 5. That means it is legal to remove the top ball from F (which is 5) and place it onto tube A. (After the move, tube A becomes [2, 1, 5, 5] and tube F becomes [3, 3, 5, 0].) Although the board is not “solved” yet, one solved tube already exists (tube G is [6, 6, 6, 6]) and the move FA brings the puzzle one step closer to eventually having three solved tubes.\n\nThus, my answer (using the prescribed two‐letter notation where the first letter is the tube you take from and the second is the tube you add to) is:\n\nAnswer: FA","I have looked over the board and found a legal move that follows the rules. In tube A the top ball is color 5 and in tube F the top ball is also color 5; since tube F isn’t full (its configuration is [3, 3, 5, 0]), we can move the top ball from tube A onto tube F. This move is legal because the moved ball (5) matches the top ball of the destination (5). It also is a step that may help toward eventually obtaining three tubes each that are completely filled with balls of the same color. \n\nAnswer: AF","I analyzed the board to “free up” a tube so that later we can clear Tube A (which hides the needed 2‐ball at its bottom) and eventually finish Tube H (which has three 2’s). One idea is to remove the top ball from Tube A (a 5) by moving it onto a tube whose top is also 5. Although Tube F is full, its top ball is a 5; if we move that 5 out from Tube F first we’d have space, but here a good “first move” is to use the reverse: move the top 5 of Tube F onto Tube A because Tube A’s current top (5) is a match and it isn’t full yet. (After this move Tube A becomes [2, 1, 5, 5] and Tube F becomes [3, 3, 5, 0]. Now Tube F is no longer full and later we can move the top ball from Tube A to F to expose the 1 and then eventually the bottom 2.) \n\nThus a legal opening move according to the rules is to move the top ball from Tube F onto Tube A, which we denote as “FA.”\n\nAnswer: FA","I looked at the board carefully. One natural “progress‐move” is to take the top ball (a 5) from tube A and put it on tube F because the top ball of F is also a 5. (In other words, move the top 5 from A onto the 5 at the top of F.) This move is legal by the rules and helps clear tube A so that lower balls (namely the 1 and eventually the 2 that sits at the bottom) become accessible. In the long‐term plan the three “completed” tubes (for example, tube G already contains all 6’s and tube H already has three 2’s, needing one more 2) may be reached by a short sequence of moves. (The very first step then is to “free” one tube so that you later can fill it with balls of the same color; in this case, “AF” is a particularly natural first step.)\n\nAnswer: AF","I'll start by looking at the board. Here are the tubes:\n\n A: [2, 1, 5, 0] → contains 3 balls, top ball is a 5.\n B: [1, 1, 0, 0] → contains 2 balls, top ball is a 1.\n C: [5, 4, 4, 4] → full tube with 4 balls; from bottom to top: 5 then three 4's.\n D: [1, 3, 4, 0] → contains 3 balls, top ball is a 4.\n E: [3, 0, 0, 0] → contains 1 ball, a 3.\n F: [3, 3, 5, 5] → full tube with 4 balls; from bottom to top: 3, 3, 5, 5.\n G: [6, 6, 6, 6] → full and already “solved” (all 6’s).\n H: [2, 2, 2, 0] → contains 3 balls, all 2’s; if a “2” is added here the tube will be complete.\n\nOne promising path is to “free” a ball from a full tube that is blocking progress. Notice that tube C holds three 4’s on top of a 5. Since we want to eventually group same colors and one possibility is to form a tube of 4’s, we need to free up the 4’s from tube C. We observe that tube D already has a 4 as its top ball (its configuration is [1, 3, 4, 0]). The move rule says that when moving a ball, the target tube must either be empty or have a top ball of the same color.\n\nThus, if we move the top ball from tube C (which is a 4) onto tube D (top ball 4), the move is allowed because the colors match. The effect of this move is:\n • Tube C becomes [5, 4, 4, 0] (the top 4 is removed),\n • Tube D becomes [1, 3, 4, 4] (now it has four balls).\n\nThis move starts untangling the mixture in tube C. Although no tube is “solved” immediately, it is a valid progression toward the goal of eventually having three tubes each with four balls of one color.\n\nSo my move is: move the top ball from tube C to tube D, which is expressed as \"CD\".\n\nAnswer: CD","We start by noticing that one tube (tube G) is already “solved” with four balls of the same color (all 6’s). To aim for three such tubes we must set up one move that brings us closer to completing one of the nearly‐complete tubes. In the present board one promising candidate is tube C, which shows [5, 4, 4, 0] (that is, three balls—with the top ball 4—and one empty slot) and tube D, which is full as [1, 3, 4, 4]. (Remember that each tube is written from bottom to top.) Although neither tube is “solved” yet, one standard approach in these puzzles is to “unload” a ball from one tube so that with one move a tube almost all of one color can be built.\n\nHere the only legal “match‐move” that obeys the rule (the ball being moved must either have the same color as the top ball of the target tube or the target must be completely empty) is to take the top ball of tube D – which is a 4 – and put it on tube C. (Tube C’s current top ball is also 4 so the rule is satisfied. Also, tube C has one empty space.) After this move tube D becomes [1, 3, 4] (three balls remaining) and tube C becomes full with [5, 4, 4, 4]. Although tube C is not yet “solved” (its bottom ball is 5, so it is not all 4’s), making a move like DC is a standard technique in these puzzles on Level 4 (epoch 95) to set up future moves that eventually allow you to complete two more tubes (one of which is nearly complete in tube H with three 2’s, waiting for a 2 to be added).\n\nThus, following the rules and the board given, the recommended move is to move the top ball from tube D to tube C.\n\nAnswer: DC","I'll analyze the board first.\n\nThe tubes (from bottom up) are: \n A: [2, 1, 5, 0] → has three balls (2, 1, 5) with one available space; its top ball is 5.\n B: [1, 1, 0, 0] → two 1’s; top ball is 1.\n C: [5, 4, 4, 4] → full (bottom 5 then three 4’s); top ball is 4.\n D: [1, 3, 4, 0] → three balls (1, 3, 4); top ball is 4.\n E: [3, 0, 0, 0] → one ball (3); top ball is 3.\n F: [3, 3, 5, 5] → full (3, 3, 5, 5); top ball is 5.\n G: [6, 6, 6, 6] → full and already solved (all 6’s).\n H: [2, 2, 2, 0] → three 2’s; top ball is 2. If we could put another 2 on H it would be solved.\n\nThe rules require that when moving a ball the target tube must either be empty or its top ball must match the color of the ball being moved. There are no completely empty tubes here, so the moving ball and the target’s top must match.\n\nLooking at the available top balls:\n A’s top: 5  B’s top: 1  C’s top: 4  D’s top: 4  E’s top: 3  F’s top: 5  H’s top: 2\n\nA promising move is to take the top ball from F (which is 5) and put it on a tube whose top is also 5. Tube A’s top ball is 5 and it is not full (it has three balls). Moving from F to A is legal, and it begins to consolidate the 5’s. (Later moves might help free other same‐color balls to complete additional solved tubes.) \n\nThus, the move is from tube F to tube A.\n\nAnswer: FA","One promising legal move is to take the top ball from tube A (which is a 5) and pour it onto tube F. (Tube F’s top ball is also a 5, so the move is allowed.) \n\nA: [2, 1, 5, 5] → after moving its top ball becomes [2, 1, 5]  \nF: [3, 3, 5, 0] → after adding the 5 becomes [3, 3, 5, 5]\n\nThis move helps by removing the extra ball from tube A so that its next ball (a 1) becomes available. In the overall puzzle the strategy is to create tubes that eventually hold four same‐colored balls; here tube G is already complete with all 6’s, and getting more tubes “set up” (for example, by eventually combining the ones in tube B with the 1 from tube A and the one hidden in tube D) will be needed. \n\nFor now, as a next move in the sequence the move “A to F” (indicated by “AF”) is a legal and useful step.\n\nAnswer: AF","I'll explain my reasoning briefly.\n\nWe must eventually obtain three “solved” tubes (each full, four balls, all of the same color). Tube G is already solved (6,6,6,6). Looking at the board the next “almost‐completed” stack is tube H (2,2,2,0) so that if you could add a 2 on top it would be complete. Other tubes already “almost match,” but in many cases an interfering ball blocks making a uniform group. One promising helper move is to begin “unlocking” moves by using one tube with open capacity as a temporary deposit. For example, note that tube A is not full (its state is [2,1,5,0]) and its top ball is a 5. In tube F the top (accessible) ball is also 5 even though tube F is full ([3,3,5,5]). By moving from F to A we use the rule (the moved ball “5” matches the top ball of A—also 5) and we place a ball on A (which is not full) so that tube F now becomes [3,3,5,0] (freeing up space for later moves) while tube A becomes [2,1,5,5]. This move is legal and is a step toward eventually unblocking the tubes so that the correct color balls may be gathered to form a uniform (solved) tube.\n\nThus my move is to move the top ball from tube F onto tube A. \n\nAnswer: FA","Let’s look carefully at the starting board. (Remember: each tube holds 4 balls and “0” means an empty cell; only the top ball may be moved; and you may only put a ball onto a tube whose current top ball is the same color or into an entirely empty tube.)\n\nHere’s the starting setup (balls are listed bottom‐to–top):\n\n A: [2, 1, 5, 5]\n B: [1, 1, 0, 0]    (contains two “1”s)\n C: [5, 4, 4, 4]    (full; top is 4)\n D: [1, 3, 4, 0]    (contains three balls, top is 4)\n E: [3, 0, 0, 0]\n F: [3, 3, 5, 0]\n G: [6, 6, 6, 6]    (already solved – four “6”s)\n H: [2, 2, 2, 0]    (three “2”s)\n\nOne promising “helper” move is to help set up a grouping – eventually we want three tubes that are “completed” (four balls of a single number). Notice that both tubes C and D have a 4 at the top (tube C’s top is 4 and tube D’s current top ball is also 4); even though tube C is full, it is always allowed to remove its top ball. So we can move the top ball from C onto D. (Tube D has room for one more ball and its top is 4, matching the ball from C.) \n\nThis move is expressed by writing the two letters: the source tube first (C) then the destination tube (D). \n\nThus the recommended move is:\n\n Move the top ball from tube C (a 4) onto tube D (whose top is also 4).\n\nIn the required answer format the very last line of our output is:\n\nAnswer: CD","I'll choose to move the top ball from tube A (which is 5) onto tube F because tube F’s top ball is also 5 and it has an empty space. This move follows the rule (“the ball being moved must either match the color of the ball at the top of the target tube or the target tube must be empty”) and it also helps by exposing the next ball in tube A that might eventually help us complete one of the target uniform tubes.\n\nAnswer: AF"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
