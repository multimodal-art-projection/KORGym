Only the bottom card of each column is face‑up; hidden cards are shown as 'XX'.  \n2. After you move a face‑up run away, the new bottom card flips face‑up automatically.  \n3.

Only the bottom card of each column is face‑up; hidden cards are shown as 'XX'.  \n2. After you move a face‑up run away, the new bottom card flips face‑up automatically.  \n3.

Only the bottom card of each column is face‑up; hidden cards are shown as 'XX'.  \n2. After you move a face‑up run away, the new bottom card flips face‑up automatically.  \n3.

You can move the 6♠ in column H (row 4) onto the 7♠ in column G (row 4), because they form a same‐suit descending run (7→6 of spades).\n\nAnswer: (H,4,G)","1. It appears that no adjacent same‐suit ranks are both exposed in a way that one can legally move onto the other, and there are no empty columns. With zero “hits” left, no further cards can be dealt. Therefore, there is no legal move remaining.\n\nAnswer: (no moves)","1. Moving the 6♠ in column H onto the 7♠ in column G is the straightforward same‐suit descending move.  \nAnswer: (H,4,G)","1. You can place the Ace of Clubs (A♣) from column C onto the 2♣ in column G, since they form a valid same‐suit descending step (2→A).  \n\nAnswer: (C,7,G)  ","1. There are no suit‐descending sequences that can legally be moved onto a higher‐ranked top card (and there are no empty columns). All columns remain blocked by higher cards of mismatched suits, and there are no “hits” left to deal new cards. Hence, no moves are possible.\n\nAnswer: (no moves)","1. One valid same‐suit descend is 6♠ onto the 7♠ in column G. This frees column H’s next card and may open subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,G)","1. It appears that no column‐top card can be placed onto another in a proper same‐suit descending run (and there are no empty columns left). Also, there are no remaining “hits” to deal new cards.

Moving 6♦ onto 7♦ frees up the 5♣ underneath, which can then move onto 6♣ and continue building a diamonds run in column F.\n\nAnswer: (A,7,F)","1. It appears that 6♣ in column E can accept the 5♣ from column A (both clubs, and 6 is exactly one rank above 5).  \nAnswer: (A,5,E)","1. Moving the 5♣ from column A onto the 6♣ in column E consolidates a same‐suit descending sequence (6♣–5♣), setting up for further club builds (e.g. adding a 4♣ later). This is typically stronger than immediately placing an Ace on a Two (which locks the pile) or moving 6♦ under 7♦ (where a 5♦ is not visible).  \n\nAnswer: (A,6,E)  ","1. You can move the bottom 6♦ in Column A onto the 7♦ in Column F (same suit, one rank apart). This frees up Column A’s next card for possible follow‑on moves.  \n\nAnswer: (A,7,F)  ","1. Moving the 6♦ from column A onto the 7♦ in column F both continues the diamond sequence and immediately flips a new card in A.\n\nAnswer: (A,7,F)","1.

You can stack the J♥ in column C onto the Q♥ in column E (both hearts, descending by one rank).  \nAnswer: (C,6,E)","1. Moving the 6♦ onto the 7♦ (same suit, consecutive ranks) is a valid move that uncovers the next card in Column A.  \n\nAnswer: (A,7,F)  ","1. It appears that column E’s face‐up cards are listed “bottom‐to‐top” (K♥ at index 3 above Q♥ at 4 above 6♣ at 5). Interpreting index 5 (6♣) as the exposed “top” of that pile, we can place the single 5♣ from column A (at index 6) onto 6♣ in column E (same suit, one rank apart).\n\nAnswer: (A,6,E)","1. It turns out that every face‐up card is either blocked by an incompatible top card or does not have a suitable place to land (no empty columns remain, and no top card is exactly one rank higher in the same suit). Also, there are no “hits” left to deal new cards. Consequently, there is simply no legal move available.\n\nAnswer: no moves","1. You can move the 5♣ in column A onto the 6♣ in column E (same suit, consecutive ranks).  \n\nAnswer: (A,6,E)  ","1. Moving 6♠ from column H onto the 7♠ in column G is valid (same suit, descending by one rank, and 7♠ is on top in G), and it frees a new card in H.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,G)","1. You can append the J♥ (column C, row 6) under the K♥‑Q♥ in column E, because Q♥ is exactly one rank higher than J♥ (all hearts). This extends that heart run and may open up further plays later.\n\nAnswer: (C,6,E)","1. By moving the 5♣ from H onto the 6♣ in E, we empty column H.  An open column is extremely valuable in Spider, as it gives us a place to park larger runs later.  Although A♣→2♣ is also possible, freeing a column first is the stronger strategic move.\n\nAnswer: (H,6,E)","1. Moving the 6♦ from column A onto the 7♦ in column F both continues a same‐suit sequence and frees up column A, which is usually advantageous in Spider.\n\nAnswer: (A,7,F)","1.

Moving 6♦ onto 7♦ continues a same‐suit sequence and frees up column A.  \nAnswer: (A,7,F)  ","1. Moving the 5♣ from under the 6♦ frees the latter to be moved subsequently onto 7♦.

Only the bottom card of each column is face‑up; hidden cards are shown as 'XX'.  \n2. After you move a face‑up run away, the new bottom card flips face‑up automatically.  \n3.

Only the bottom card of each column is face‑up; hidden cards are shown as 'XX'.  \n2. After you move a face‑up run away, the new bottom card flips face‑up automatically.  \n3. Completing a full K→A same‑suit sequence in any column removes those 13 cards immediately and awards +1 point.  \n\n### Columns & Format\n- Columns are labeled A–J (indices 0–9).  \n- Always output exactly:  'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER',e.g.'Answer: (A,4,B)' means move cards from column A starting at index 4 to column B.\n\n\nCurrent Game Board:\n  A B C D E F G H I J\n  -------------------\n0 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX\n1 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX\n2 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX\n3 XX XX XX XX K♥ XX XX XX XX XX\n4 XX XX XX XX    K♣ 7♠ 6♠ J♣ K♦\n5 4♦ 10♠ 9♣ Q♠                Q♦\nEpoch: 101\/100\nThe remaining chances of 'hit': 0\n\n","seed":19,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
