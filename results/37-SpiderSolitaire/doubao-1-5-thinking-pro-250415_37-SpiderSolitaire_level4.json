Since 7 is exactly one rank lower than 8 and both are hearts, moving 7♥ to J creates a 2-card same-suit descending run (8♥, 7♥). This advances the heart sequence and is a step toward building a full K→A sequence.\n\n2. **3♥ (Column D) → 4♥ (Column C)**:  \n   Column D’s bottom card is 3♥ (hearts), and Column C’s bottom card is 4♥ (hearts).

This allows moving the single-card run [7♥] from Column F to Column J, forming a descending, same-suit sequence (8♥, 7♥).  \n- Other potential moves (e.g., 3♥ from D to 4♥ in C, or Q♠ from B to K♦ in E) either create mixed-suit stacks or less critical sequences.

Since only single face-up cards are visible, we focus on moving individual cards.\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n- **Column F (7♥)**: The bottom card is 7♥ (suit ♥, rank 7). Column J has a top card of 8♥ (suit ♥, rank 8). Since 8♥ is exactly one rank higher than 7♥ and they share the same suit, moving 7♥ from F to J creates a same-suit descending run (8♥-7♥).

Column J's bottom card is 8♥ (hearts), which is exactly one rank higher (8 > 7, same suit). This allows a valid move of the single-card run [7♥] from Column F to Column J.\n- **Column D (3♥)**: The bottom card is 3♥ (hearts). Column C's bottom card is 4♥ (hearts), which is also one rank higher (4 > 3, same suit).

Moving 3♥ to 4♥ connects two consecutive hearts (3♥→4♥), forming a small same-suit run. This supports building upward toward higher hearts (e.g., 5♥, 6♥) and ultimately a complete K→A sequence. Additionally, revealing D’s hidden card (index 4) may provide further opportunities.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,C)","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board to identify legal moves that build descending, same-suit sequences (key for completing K→A sequences) or free up columns. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- All columns are non-empty, so moves must target columns with a top card exactly one rank higher.\n- Same-suit runs are prioritized to progress toward completing K→A sequences.\n- Moving single cards to form same-suit pairs is valuable, as is freeing up columns for future moves.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n1. **(D,5,C)**: Move 3♥ (column D) to 4♥ (column C). This forms a 2-card same-suit run (4♥, 3♥) and frees column D.\n2. **(F,4,J)**: Move 7♥ (column F) to 8♥ (column J). This forms a 2-card same-suit run (8♥, 7♥) and frees column F.\n\n### Evaluation:\nBoth moves create same-suit runs and free columns. However, building higher-rank same-suit sequences (e.g., 8♥→7♥) is more strategic, as higher ranks are closer to the King (K), which starts a sequence. Thus, moving 7♥ to 8♥ (same suit) is preferable.\n\nAnswer: (F,4,J)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Columns with visible top cards**: \n  - Column C (top: 4♥), Column D (top: 3♥), Column F (top: 7♥), Column J (top: 8♥).\n- **Valid moves**: \n  - 3♥ (Column D, index 5) can move to 4♥ (Column C, index 5) since 3 is one rank lower and same suit (♥).\n  - 7♥ (Column F, index 4) can move to 8♥ (Column J, index 4) since 7 is one rank lower and same suit (♥).\n\n### Reasoning:\nBoth moves build 2-card same-suit sequences, which is critical for forming K→A sequences. However, moving 7♥ (Column F) to 8♥ (Column J) creates a higher-rank sequence (8♥-7♥), which is more likely to connect with higher hidden cards (e.g., 9♥) that could later link to 10♥ (Column A’s top).

Here’s the breakdown:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Visible Top Cards**: Columns have the following visible top cards (face-up):  \n  A: K♣, B: 5♣, C: 3♠, D: A♦, E: J♥, F: 6♣, G: 3♠, H: 8♠, I: 3♥, J: 2♠.  \n- **Valid Moves**:  \n  - Column B (5♣) can move to Column F (6♣) because 5♣ is one rank lower than 6♣ (same suit, descending).  \n  - Column J (2♠) can move to Columns C or G (3♠) because 2♠ is one rank lower than 3♠ (same suit, descending).  \n\n### Best Move Selection:\nMoving 5♣ (Column B) to 6♣ (Column F) creates a 6♣-5♣ same-suit sequence. This is more strategically valuable than moving 2♠ (Column J) because higher-rank sequences (closer to King) are critical for building complete K→A sequences. Additionally, this move may reveal a hidden card under Column B, potentially enabling further extensions of the sequence.\n\nAnswer: (B,5,F)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible face-up cards and potential legal moves. Only the bottom card of each column is visible, so we focus on single-card moves (since longer runs require hidden cards, which are unknown).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Legal Moves Requirement**: A card with rank \\( R \\) can be moved to a column with a top card of rank \\( R+1 \\).\n- **Visible Cards**:  \n  - Columns with face-up cards: A (K♣), B (5♣), C (3♠), D (A♦), E (J♥), F (6♣), G (3♠), H (8♠), I (3♥), J (2♠).  \n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **5♣ (B) → 6♣ (F)**: 5♣ (rank 5) can move to F (6♣, rank 6), as \\( 5+1=6 \\). This forms a descending, same-suit (Club) run (6♣, 5♣), which helps build toward a K→A Club sequence (K♣ is in Column A).  \n2. **2♠ (J) → 3♠ (C\/G)**: 2♠ (rank 2) can move to C or G (3♠, rank 3), as \\( 2+1=3 \\). This forms a descending, same-suit (Spade) run (3♠, 2♠), but Spades lack higher visible cards (e.g., 8♠ in H is not directly connectable to 3♠).  \n3. **A♦ (D) → 2♠ (J)**: A♦ (rank 1) can move to J (2♠, rank 2), but this creates a mixed-suit run (2♠, A♦), which is less useful for building complete sequences.  \n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 5♣ from B to F prioritizes building a same-suit (Club) sequence, which aligns with the goal of completing K→A sequences (K♣ is already in Column A). This move directly supports a potential Club sequence (K♣ ← Q♣ ← J♣ ← ... ← 6♣ ← 5♣).\n\nAnswer: (B,5,F)","\n\nTo determine the best next move, we analyze the visible cards and valid moves based on Spider Solitaire rules. The goal is to build descending, same-suit sequences leading to complete K→A sequences. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- Only the bottom card of each column is visible.\n- A valid move requires relocating a descending, same-suit run to a column with a top card exactly one rank higher (or an empty column). No empty columns exist here.\n\n### Valid Moves:\n1. **Column B (5♣) to Column F (6♣)**:  \n   Column B’s top card is 5♣ (clubs). Column F’s top card is 6♣ (clubs), which is exactly one rank higher (6 > 5). Moving 5♣ to F creates a 6♣-5♣ same-suit descending sequence, which is beneficial for building longer club sequences.  \n\n2. **Column J (2♠) to Columns C\/G\/I (3♠\/3♠\/3♥)**:  \n   Column J’s top card is 2♠ (spades). Columns C, G, and I have top cards of 3♠, 3♠, and 3♥ (all one rank higher than 2). These are valid moves but create shorter sequences (3♠-2♠ or 3♥-2♠) compared to the 6♣-5♣ sequence.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 5♣ from Column B to 6♣ in Column F prioritizes building a longer same-suit sequence (clubs), which is more strategic for eventual K→A completion.\n\nAnswer: (B,5,F)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards and possible legal moves.

Column F has 6♣ (clubs, rank 6). Since 5♣ is one rank lower than 6♣ and they share the same suit, moving 5♣ to 6♣ creates a 2-card same-suit descending sequence (6♣→5♣). This advances the clubs suit toward forming a complete K→A sequence (K♣ is already present in column A).  \n\nOther potential moves (e.g., moving 2♠ to 3♠) also form same-suit sequences but are less impactful for building longer sequences toward a K→A completion.  \n\nAnswer: (B,5,F)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible top cards of each column and check for valid single-card moves (since no longer descending same-suit runs are visible).

Only the bottom card of each column is face-up, and we can move a descending, same-suit run (even a single card) to a column with a top card exactly one rank higher (or an empty column, but there are none here).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Visible Cards**:  \n   - Columns with face-up cards: A (K♣), B (5♣), C (3♠), D (A♦), E (J♥), F (6♣), G (3♠), H (8♠), I (3♥), J (2♠).  \n\n2. **Valid Moves**:  \n   - **5♣ (B) → 6♣ (F)**: 5♣ (rank 5, club) can move to 6♣ (rank 6, club) since 6 is one rank higher and same suit.  \n   - **2♠ (J) → 3♠ (C or G)**: 2♠ (rank 2, spade) can move to 3♠ (rank 3, spade) in columns C or G (both 3♠, spade), as 3 is one rank higher and same suit.  \n\n### Best Move Selection:\nBuilding sequences from lower ranks (e.g., 2→3→4...) is critical for completing K→A sequences. Moving 2♠ (J) to 3♠ (C) creates a 3♠-2♠ same-suit run, which is a step toward forming a spade sequence (A→2→3...→K). This move also flips the hidden card in column J (index 3), potentially revealing a useful card (e.g., A♠) to extend the sequence.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,C)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards and valid moves based on Spider Solitaire rules. Only the bottom card of each column is face-up, so the only possible moves involve relocating single face-up cards (trivially valid same-suit runs of length 1) to columns where the top card is exactly one rank higher.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Valid Moves**: We need to find face-up cards that can be placed on another column’s top card (one rank higher). \n- **Same-Suit Priority**: Moving same-suit cards is preferred, as completing a full K→A same-suit sequence awards points.\n\n### Analysis of Columns:\n- **Column J (bottom: 2♠)**: Can move to columns with top card 3 (since 2 + 1 = 3). Columns C, G, and I have top cards 3♠, 3♠, and 3♥, respectively. Moving 2♠ to a 3♠ (same suit) is optimal.\n- **Column B (bottom: 5♣)**: Can move to column F (top: 6♣, same suit), as 5 + 1 = 6.\n- **Other columns**: No other face-up cards have valid targets (e.g., K♣, J♥, 8♠, etc., lack higher-ranked targets).\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 2♠ (Column J, index 4) to 3♠ (Column C, index 5) creates a same-suit descending run (3♠, 2♠), which is more likely to contribute to a complete K→A sequence than other options.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,C)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board for possible legal moves. A legal move involves relocating a descending, same-suit run to a column with a top card exactly one rank higher (or an empty column). \n\n### Key Observations:\n- All columns have only one face-up card (the bottom card), so only single-card moves are possible.\n- We need to find pairs where a card can be placed on another card one rank higher.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **Column B (5♣) → Column F (6♣):** 5♣ (rank 5) can move to 6♣ (rank 6) because 5 + 1 = 6. Both are clubs (same suit), forming a descending same-suit run (6♣-5♣), which is critical for building complete K→A sequences.\n2. **Column J (2♠) → Columns C\/G (3♠):** 2♠ (rank 2) can move to 3♠ (rank 3), but this forms a shorter run (3♠-2♠) compared to the 6♣-5♣ run.\n3. **Column D (A♦) → Column J (2♠):** A♦ (rank 1) can move to 2♠ (rank 2), but they are different suits, making this less useful for building same-suit sequences.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 5♣ (B) to 6♣ (F) creates a longer same-suit run (6♣-5♣), which is more valuable for progressing toward a complete K→A sequence.\n\nAnswer: (B,5,F)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible bottom cards of each column and check for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column B** has a bottom card of `5♣` (5 of Clubs).  \n- **Column F** has a bottom card of `6♣` (6 of Clubs).  \n- `5♣` is exactly one rank lower than `6♣` and shares the same suit (Clubs). This makes `5♣` a valid candidate to move onto `6♣`.  \n\n### Valid Move:\nMoving `5♣` from Column B (index 5, the bottom card) to Column F will create a descending, same-suit run (`6♣, 5♣`). After moving, the new bottom card in Column B (previously hidden) will flip face-up, potentially revealing a useful card.  \n\nAnswer: (B,5,F)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards and valid moves based on Spider Solitaire rules.

Column F has a top card of 6♣ (row 4). Since 5♣ is one rank lower than 6♣ and both are clubs, moving 5♣ from B to F is valid.  \n   - Column J has a top card of 2♠ (row 4). Column C has a top card of 3♠ (row 5). Since 2♠ is one rank lower than 3♠ and both are spades, moving 2♠ from J to C is also valid.  \n\n2. **Strategic Preference**: Building longer same-suit sequences closer to higher ranks (e.g., 6♣-5♣) is more valuable than lower-rank sequences (e.g., 3♠-2♠), as higher ranks are closer to completing K→A sequences.

To move this, we need a column with a top card of 3♠ (one rank higher, same suit).  \n   - Columns C and G both have 3♠ as their bottom cards (index 5 for C, index 4 for G).  \n   - Moving 2♠ from J to G (which has 3♠) is valid because 2♠ is one rank lower than 3♠ and they share the same suit (♠).  \n\n2. **Other Options**:  \n   - Column B has 5♣ (index 5), which could move to F (6♣, index 4), but this is a higher rank and less critical for building lower sequences.  \n   - Moving 2♠ to G directly builds a 3♠→2♠ sequence, which is a step toward forming a longer descending sequence.  \n\nAnswer: (J,4,G)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible bottom cards of each column and check for valid moves where a descending, same-suit run can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- Only the bottom card of each column is face-up, so the only possible runs to move are single cards (since hidden cards above are unknown).\n- Valid moves require the target column's bottom card to be exactly one rank higher than the card being moved.\n\n### Valid Moves Identified:\n1. **Column B (5♣) → Column F (6♣)**:  \n   Column B's bottom card is 5♣ (rank 5). Column F's bottom card is 6♣ (rank 6), which is exactly one rank higher. Moving 5♣ to 6♣ creates a same-suit (clubs) descending run (6♣ → 5♣), which helps build toward a complete K→A club sequence (K♣ is already in Column A).\n\n2. **Column J (2♠) → Columns C\/G\/I (3♠\/3♠\/3♥)**:  \n   Column J's bottom card is 2♠ (rank 2). Columns C, G, and I have bottom cards of rank 3, which is one rank higher.

Column J's bottom card is 2♠ (rank 2), which is one rank higher. However, this creates a mixed-suit run (2♠ → A♦), which does not contribute to building a complete same-suit sequence.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 5♣ (Column B) to 6♣ (Column F) builds a same-suit (clubs) descending run, directly supporting the completion of a K→A club sequence (since K♣ is already present in Column A).

Since only the bottom card of each column is visible, we focus on single-card moves (trivially valid runs of length 1).\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n- **E (2♦) to I (3♦)**: 2♦ (diamonds) can be placed on 3♦ (diamonds) because 3 is one rank higher than 2. This creates a 2-card same-suit (diamonds) descending run (3♦-2♦), which is ideal for building longer sequences toward a complete K→A sequence.\n- Other same-suit moves (e.g., F (3♥) to C (4♥)) are valid but less critical, as 2♦ is a lower rank and building from the bottom (A) up is more urgent for completing sequences.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,I)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards and potential moves that build descending, same-suit sequences, which are critical for completing K→A sequences.

This forms a descending sequence 3♦ → 2♦.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 3♥ from Column F to Column C (4♥) is preferable as it builds a heart sequence, which may help expose hidden cards in Column F when the top card is moved (flipping the next hidden card in Column F face-up).\n\nAnswer: (F,4,C)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards and possible legal moves. Each column's visible card (bottom card) is a single-card run since only the bottom card is face-up.

The top card of **Column C** is `4♥` (index 5), which is exactly one rank higher and the same suit. This makes `3♥` (from F) a valid candidate to move onto `4♥` (in C).\n- No other columns have visible cards that form a valid descending, same-suit run with another column's top card. For example, `2♦` (Column E) could move to `3♦` (Column I), but `3♥` → `4♥` is a direct, immediate sequence extension in the same suit, which is more critical for building longer sequences toward completing K→A stacks.\n\nAnswer: (F,4,C)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board to identify valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- Only the bottom card of each column is visible (face-up).

This creates a 10♥-9♥ same-suit run, which is valuable for building a complete heart sequence.\n- **8♠ (Column H)** can move to **9♠ (Column A)** (same suit, 9 is one rank higher than 8). This creates a 9♠-8♠ same-suit run, useful for a spade sequence.\n- Other moves (e.g., 6♠→7♥, 8♦→9♠) involve mixed suits and are less helpful for forming complete sequences.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 9♥ (Column I) to 10♥ (Column F) prioritizes building a same-suit run (10♥-9♥), which is more likely to contribute to a complete K→A heart sequence.\n\nAnswer: (I,4,F)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board to identify legal moves that build towards completing same-suit descending sequences (K→A).

Moving 7♣ to G creates a descending, same-suit run (8♣, 7♣), which is valuable for building a future K→A sequence.\n- Other moves (e.g., 3♠ → 4♠, 2♠ → 3♠) also create same-suit runs but involve lower ranks (3, 2) compared to 7 and 8, which are closer to King (13) and thus more strategic to prioritize.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving 7♣ from Column E to Column G builds a higher-value same-suit run, making it the best next action.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,G)","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible face-up cards and potential legal moves.

Since 2♠ is one rank lower than 3♠ and they share the same suit (spades), moving 2♠ from B to D is legal. This creates a 3♠-2♠ sequence in column D, which can later be extended to column F (4♠) to form a longer 4♠-3♠-2♠ sequence.\n- **Other Moves**: While other moves (e.g., A♥ to 2♥, 7♣ to 8♣) are possible, they form shorter 2-card sequences. The spades sequence has the highest potential for growth, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: (B,5,D)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board to identify valid moves that build descending, same-suit sequences, which are critical for completing K→A sequences.

This creates a 2-card descending, same-suit sequence (4♠, 3♠) in F.\n- This move supports building a longer spade sequence (e.g., future 5♠ could be placed on 4♠, and 2♠ from Column B could later be placed on 3♠).\n\nAnswer: (D,0,F)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible bottom cards of each column and look for valid descending, same-suit sequences that can be moved to a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Spades (♠) Suit**: Columns B (2♠), D (3♠), and F (4♠) have consecutive ranks (2, 3, 4) in the same suit. Building these into a descending sequence (4♠ → 3♠ → 2♠) is critical for forming a K→A sequence.\n- **Valid Moves**: \n  - 3♠ (D) can move to 4♠ (F) because 3♠ is one rank lower than 4♠ and same suit.\n  - This move initiates a descending spades sequence (4♠, 3♠) in column F, which can later extend with 2♠ (B) if moved next.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 3♠ from column D to column F builds a partial spades sequence, advancing progress toward a complete K→A sequence.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,F)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board to identify valid moves that build towards completing same-suit K→A sequences. Only the bottom card of each column is visible, so we focus on moving single visible cards to columns with a top card exactly one rank higher.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Valid Moves**: We can move a card to another column if the destination's top card is one rank higher. Same-suit moves are prioritized as they directly contribute to building the required K→A sequences.\n- **Same-Suit Opportunities**: \n  - Column J has A♥ (Ace of hearts), and column A has 2♥ (Two of hearts). Moving A♥ to 2♥ creates a descending same-suit sequence (2♥ → A♥), which is a step toward building a complete heart sequence.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving A♥ from column J (index 4) to column A (index 5) forms a 2-card same-suit sequence (2♥, A♥), which is valuable for progressing toward a full K→A sequence.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,A)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards and potential descending same-suit runs.

These form a potential descending sequence (4♠ → 3♠ → 2♠) if stacked.\n- Column F (top: 4♠) can accept a run ending with 3♠ (one rank lower, same suit). Column D has a face-up 3♠, which is a valid run of length 1.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 3♠ from Column D (index 5) to Column F (top: 4♠) creates a 2-card sequence (4♠, 3♠).

This makes it a valid move to place 3♠ onto 4♠.\n\n### Reasoning:\nMoving 3♠ from Column D to Column F creates a descending same-suit run (4♠ → 3♠) in Column F. This helps build longer sequences, which is critical for eventually forming complete K→A sequences.

A valid move requires placing a card on a column whose top card is exactly one rank higher.\n- **Same-Suit Runs**: Prioritizing moves that create same-suit runs helps build towards completing sequences. \n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **(F,0,J)**: Moving 9♠ (column F, bottom card) to 10♠ (column J, bottom card) creates a 2-card same-suit (spades) run: 10♠ → 9♠. This is valuable because same-suit runs can be extended later (e.g., with 8♠ if exposed).\n- Other moves (e.g., (H,0,A) or (I,0,A)) create different-suit runs or less useful sequences.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving 9♠ to 10♠ builds a same-suit spade run, which is the most strategic step toward completing a K→A sequence.\n\nAnswer: (F,0,J)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the columns to find valid descending, same-suit runs that can be moved to a column with a top card one rank higher or an empty column. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column F** has a bottom card of `9♠` (index 7). \n- **Column J** has a bottom card of `10♠` (index 7). \n- `9♠` (rank 9) is exactly one rank lower than `10♠` (rank 10), and both are spades (same suit). \n\nThus, moving `9♠` from Column F (index 7) to Column J will create a descending, same-suit run of `10♠, 9♠` in Column J, which is a useful step toward building longer sequences.\n\nAnswer: (F,7,J)","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards (bottom of each column) and look for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Visible Cards**: Only the bottom card of each column is visible. We need to check if any visible card can be moved to another column with a top card one rank higher (same suit).\n2. **Valid Moves**:\n   - Column H has a visible card `6♦` (rank 6, suit ♦). Column A has a visible card `7♦` (rank 7, suit ♦). Since 6 is one rank lower than 7 and the suits match, `6♦` can be moved from H to A.\n   - Column F has a visible card `9♠` (rank 9, suit ♠).

Kings are critical as they start K→A sequences.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving 6♦ from Column G to Column A builds a 7♦-6♦ (diamond) same-suit sequence and reveals K♠, a high-value King, in Column G.\n\nAnswer: (G,7,A)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board for valid descending, same-suit runs and targets with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Column I** has a top card of `6♠` (rank 6).

The goal is to build descending, same-suit runs and reveal hidden cards to progress toward completing K→A sequences. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Visible Cards**: Each column’s visible (face-up) card is the topmost non-XX card. For example, column I shows `10♣` (row 4), column A shows `J♣` (row 7), and column F shows `A♠` (row 4).\n2. **Valid Moves**: A move requires relocating a descending, same-suit run to a column with a top card exactly one rank higher.

The user's instructions specify the answer must be one of the options listed, which are moves like (A,4,B) or 'hit'. Since there are no moves and 'hit' is not allowed, but the problem requires an answer, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. Oh, perhaps the columns' indices are different. For example, in column E, index 4 is 7♥. If we consider that the start index is the position from the top (0-based), then moving from E's index 4 (the bottom card) to another column.

Column D: 6 cards (XX except 3♦ at 5). Columns E-J have 5 cards each (indices 0-4). So all columns have 5 or 6 cards. None are empty.

Since there's no valid move and 'hit' is not allowed, perhaps the answer is 'hit' even though chances are 0. But no, the rules say \"remaining chances of 'hit': 0\" so can't hit. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that there are no legal moves, but since the options don't include that, perhaps the problem expects to output 'hit' incorrectly. But according to the rules, 'hit' is only allowed if no legal moves, deck has ≥10 cards, and every column is non-empty. Here, remaining chances are 0, so 'hit' is not allowed. \n\nThus, the answer is that there are no moves, but since the format requires one, I must have made a mistake.

Q is one rank higher than J, and same suit (diamonds). So moving J♦ from H to J is a valid move. \n\nYes! Let's confirm: \n\n- From column H (J♦), start index 4 (since the bottom card is at index 4, which is the only visible card). To column J (Q♦). \n\nThe move would be (H,4,J).

These are:  \n   A: 3♠, B: 10♥, C: A♦, D: 3♣, E: Q♦, F: J♠, G: J♦, H: 9♠, I: 6♣, J: 3♠.  \n\n2. **Valid Moves**: A move is allowed if a descending, same-suit run (even a single card) can be placed on a column whose top card is exactly one rank higher. Since all columns have non-empty, we check for such opportunities:  \n   - J♦ (column G, rank 11) can be placed on Q♦ (column E, rank 12) because Q♦ is one rank higher (11 + 1 = 12) and both are diamonds (same suit). This forms a descending, same-suit run (Q♦ → J♦), which is valuable for building longer sequences.  \n\nOther potential moves (e.g., 9♠ to 10♥, J♠ to Q♦) either involve different suits or create less useful runs. Moving J♦ to Q♦ maximizes progress toward forming complete K→A sequences.\n\nAnswer: (G,4,E)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board to identify valid descending, same-suit runs that can be moved to a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column E** has a visible top card: Q♦ (Queen of Diamonds).  \n- **Column G** has a visible top card: J♦ (Jack of Diamonds).  \n- J♦ (rank 11) is exactly one rank lower than Q♦ (rank 12), and both are Diamonds (same suit).  \n\nThis makes moving J♦ from Column G to Column E a valid move, as it follows the rule of placing a descending, same-suit run onto a column with a top card one rank higher.  \n\nAnswer: (G,4,E)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board to identify legal moves. A legal move requires relocating a descending, same-suit run onto a column whose top card is exactly one rank higher (or an empty column). \n\n### Key Observations:\n- All columns have only one face-up card (no multi-card runs to move).\n- The top card of column G is J♦ (diamonds, rank 11). The top card of column E is Q♦ (diamonds, rank 12). \n- J♦ is one rank lower than Q♦ and shares the same suit (diamonds), making it a valid descending, same-suit run.\n\n### Valid Move:\nMove J♦ from column G (index 4) to column E, as Q♦ (E) is exactly one rank higher and matches the suit.\n\nAnswer: (G,4,E)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the face-up cards (bottom of each column) and check for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be moved to a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- Only the bottom card of each column is face-up, so we can only consider single-card runs (trivially descending and same-suit).\n- Column G has a face-up card: J♦ (rank 11, suit ♦).\n- Column E has a face-up card: Q♦ (rank 12, suit ♦). Q♦ is exactly one rank higher than J♦, and both are diamonds (same suit).\n\n### Valid Move:\nMoving J♦ from column G (index 4) to column E, as Q♦ (column E) is the correct rank and suit to accept the run.\n\nAnswer: (G,4,E)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible top cards of each column and look for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column E** has a top card of Q♦ (rank 12, suit diamond).\n- **Column G** has a top card of J♦ (rank 11, suit diamond). \n- J♦ (rank 11) is exactly one rank lower than Q♦ (rank 12) and shares the same suit (diamond).

Q♦ is exactly one rank higher than J♦ and shares the same suit.\n\n### Valid Move:\nMoving the J♦ from column G (start index 4, the position of the face-up card) to column E, as Q♦ is the required one-rank-higher card of the same suit.\n\nAnswer: (G,4,E)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards in each column.

Column E has Q♦ (rank 12, suit ♦). Since Q♦ is exactly one rank higher than J♦ and they share the same suit, moving J♦ from G to E is legal.\n\nAnswer: (G,4,E)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the face-up cards (bottom of each column) and look for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column E** has Q♦ (diamonds, rank 12), which can accept a J (rank 11) to form a descending sequence.\n- **Column G** has J♦ (diamonds, rank 11), a same-suit run (single card) that is exactly one rank lower than Q♦.

This makes `J♦` a valid descending, same-suit run that can be moved onto `Q♦`.\n\n### Reasoning:\nMoving `J♦` from Column G to Column E creates a descending, same-suit sequence (`Q♦ → J♦`), which is critical for building complete K→A same-suit sequences (the game’s goal). This move directly contributes to forming a potential ♦ suit sequence, making it the most strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: (G,4,E)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards (bottom cards of each column) and check for valid moves where a descending, same-suit run can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- All columns have only their bottom card face-up (visibility rule 1).\n- Valid moves involve relocating a single face-up card (a run of length 1) to a column with a top card one rank higher.\n\n### Potential Moves:\n- **Column G (J♦, rank 11)**: Can be moved to column E (Q♦, rank 12). Q♦ is one rank higher than J♦, and both are diamonds (same suit). This creates a 2-card same-suit sequence (Q♦ → J♦), which is valuable for building complete K→A sequences.\n- Other moves (e.g., 9♠ to 10♥, J♠ to Q♦) involve different suits, which are less useful for forming same-suit runs.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving J♦ from column G to column E leverages the same suit (diamonds) to start building a descending sequence, increasing the potential to form a complete K→A sequence later.\n\nAnswer: (G,4,E)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible bottom cards of each column and check for legal moves. A legal move requires relocating a descending, same-suit run to a column whose top card is exactly one rank higher. Since only the bottom card of each column is visible, we focus on single-card moves (trivially same-suit runs of length 1).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column E (Q♦, rank 12, diamonds)** can accept a card of rank 11 (J) to form a descending sequence.  \n- **Column G (J♦, rank 11, diamonds)** has a J♦, which is exactly one rank lower than Q♦ (E) and shares the same suit (diamonds). Moving J♦ to Q♦ creates a 2-card same-suit descending sequence (Q♦ → J♦), which is progress toward building a full K→A sequence.  \n\n### Best Move:\nMove the J♦ from column G (starting at its bottom card, index 4) to column E.  \n\nAnswer: (G,4,E)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards and check for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- All columns have non-empty stacks, so no empty columns are available.\n- The visible bottom cards of each column are: A (3♠), B (10♥), C (A♦), D (3♣), E (Q♦), F (J♠), G (J♦), H (9♠), I (6♣), J (3♠).\n- A valid move requires a descending, same-suit run to be placed on a column with a top card one rank higher. \n\n### Valid Move Found:\n- Column G has a visible bottom card J♦ (Jack of diamonds). Column E has a visible top card Q♦ (Queen of diamonds). Since Q is exactly one rank higher than J, and both are diamonds (same suit), the single-card run J♦ in column G can be moved to column E.\n\nAnswer: (G,4,E)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the face-up cards and possible legal moves. The goal is to build descending, same-suit runs that can eventually form complete K→A sequences. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Face-up Cards**: Columns E (Q♦), F (J♠), G (J♦), H (9♠), I (6♣), J (3♠), A (3♠), B (10♥), C (A♦), D (3♣) have visible top cards.\n- **Legal Moves**: A valid move requires relocating a descending, same-suit run to a column with a top card exactly one rank higher (or an empty column). Since hidden cards (XX) are unknown, only single-card runs (the visible top cards) are viable.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **J♦ (G, rank 11) → Q♦ (E, rank 12)**: J♦ (diamonds) is a single-card, same-suit run. Q♦ (diamonds) is one rank higher, forming a 2-card same-suit run (Q♦, J♦). This advances a potential diamond sequence.\n2. **J♠ (F, rank 11) → Q♦ (E, rank 12)**: J♠ (spades) is a single-card run, but Q♦ (diamonds) is a different suit. The resulting stack (Q♦, J♠) is mixed-suit, less useful for building sequences.\n3. **9♠ (H, rank 9) → 10♥ (B, rank 10)**: 9♠ (spades) is a single-card run, but 10♥ (hearts) is a different suit. The resulting stack (10♥, 9♠) is mixed-suit.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving J♦ (G) to Q♦ (E) creates a 2-card same-suit (diamonds) run, which is more likely to contribute to a complete K→A sequence.\n\nAnswer: (G,4,E)","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards and valid moves based on the rules. Each column's face-up card (the bottom card) is considered, and we check if it can be moved to another column whose top card is exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Face-up Cards**: Columns E (Q♦), F (J♠), G (J♦), H (9♠), I (6♣), J (3♠), A (3♠), B (10♥), C (A♦), D (3♣).\n- **Valid Moves**: A single face-up card (a trivially descending, same-suit run) can be moved to a column with a top card one rank higher. \n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **9♠ (Column H, index 4) → 10♥ (Column B, index 5)**: 9 is one rank lower than 10, so 9♠ can be placed on 10♥. This move exposes the hidden card in Column H (index 3) after moving, potentially revealing a useful card for future sequences.\n2. **J♠ (Column F, index 4) → Q♦ (Column E, index 4)**: J is one rank lower than Q, so J♠ can be placed on Q♦. This also exposes a hidden card in Column F (index 3).\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 9♠ from Column H to Column B (H,4,B) is preferable because building downward from 10 (a mid-range rank) may help form longer descending sequences sooner, increasing the chance of exposing critical cards (e.g., 8♠) to continue building toward a complete K→A sequence.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,B)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board to identify valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- All columns have non-empty face-up cards (no empty columns).\n- We need to find a same-suit run whose top card is one rank lower than the destination column's top card.\n\n### Valid Moves:\n- **Column G** has a top card of `J♦` (rank 11, suit diamond). \n- **Column E** has a top card of `Q♦` (rank 12, suit diamond). \n- Since `J♦` is exactly one rank lower than `Q♦` and they share the same suit (diamond), moving `J♦` from Column G to Column E is a valid move.\n\nAnswer: (G,4,E)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the face-up cards and potential legal moves.

The destination column must have a top card of `8♥` (since 7 + 1 = 8, same suit). \n- **Column A** has a bottom card of `8♥` (index 5), which matches the required rank and suit for `7♥` from Column J.\n\nThus, moving `7♥` from Column J (index 4) to Column A is a valid move.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,A)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible bottom cards of each column and check for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be moved to a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- Only the bottom card of each column is visible (face-up).\n- A valid move requires relocating a descending, same-suit run to a column where the top card is exactly one rank higher (or an empty column, but none exist here).\n\n### Column Bottom Cards (rank, suit):\n- A: 8♥ (8, ♥)  \n- B: Q♦ (12, ♦)  \n- C: A♦ (1, ♦)  \n- D: 9♣ (9, ♣)  \n- E: A♣ (1, ♣)  \n- F: J♥ (11, ♥)  \n- G: 5♠ (5, ♠)  \n- H: J♣ (11, ♣)  \n- I: 4♣ (4, ♣)  \n- J: 7♥ (7, ♥)  \n\n### Valid Move:\nColumn J has a bottom card of 7♥ (rank 7, suit ♥). Column A has a bottom card of 8♥ (rank 8, suit ♥).

Thus, only single-card moves are possible (since hidden cards above are unknown).\n- The goal is to build same-suit K→A sequences. Prioritizing same-suit runs helps progress toward completing sequences.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n- **Column J (7♥) → Column A (8♥)**: 7♥ (rank 7) can move to 8♥ (rank 8) because 8 is exactly one rank higher. This creates a 2-card same-suit (♥) descending run (8♥-7♥), which is valuable for building a complete sequence.\n- Other moves (e.g., 4♣ → 5♠, J♥ → Q♦) involve mixed suits, which do not directly contribute to completing same-suit sequences.\n\nThe best move is to build a same-suit run with 7♥ onto 8♥.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,A)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards and valid moves. Each column has only one face-up card (the bottom card), so the only possible runs are single cards.

Hidden cards above are irrelevant since their suits\/ranks are unknown, so we focus on single-card moves or runs involving visible cards.\n- The goal is to build same-suit sequences (K→A). Prioritizing moves that form same-suit runs is critical.\n\n### Valid Moves:\n- **7♥ (J, index 4)**: Rank 7, suit hearts.

A valid target is column G (Q♦), as Q is one rank higher than J. Moving J♠ to G is valid and creates a descending sequence (Q♦ → J♠) in column G. After this move, column E’s new bottom card (3♠, previously hidden) flips up, which can later be moved to column D (4♠, same suit) to extend the sequence.\n- Other moves (e.g., moving A♣ to J or J♦ to G) either create shorter sequences or do not align as well with building longer same-suit runs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving J♠ from column E to column G is the best move, as it enables future extensions of a same-suit (♠) sequence.\n\nAnswer: (E,5,G)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible bottom cards of each column and look for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column B** has a bottom card of `J♦` (face-up, rank 11, suit ♦). \n- **Column G** has a bottom card of `Q♦` (face-up, rank 12, suit ♦). \n\nSince `J♦` (11) is exactly one rank lower than `Q♦` (12) and both are the same suit (♦), moving `J♦` from Column B to Column G is a valid move.

Thus, J♦ (a single-card same-suit run) can be moved to Column G, forming a descending same-suit run (Q♦ → J♦).  \n\n### Other Options:\n- Moving A♣ (Column C) to 2♣ (Column J) forms a 2-card club run (2♣ → A♣), but this is less impactful since A is the lowest rank.  \n- Moving J♠ (Column E) to Q♦ (Column G) creates a mixed-suit run (Q♦ → J♠), which does not help build a same-suit sequence.  \n- Moving Q♦ (Column G) to K♣ (Column I) creates a mixed-suit run (K♣ → Q♦), which is also less useful.  \n\n### Best Move:\nMoving J♦ from Column B to Column G builds a same-suit diamond run (Q♦ → J♦), which is a step toward completing a K→A sequence.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,G)","\nTo determine the best next action, we analyze the current board, focusing on valid moves (relocating descending, same-suit runs to columns with a top card one rank higher or empty columns). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Visible and Hidden Cards**: The bottom card of each column is face-up, and hidden cards are known (e.g., column B has hidden card 10♥ above its bottom card J♦).\n2. **Valid Runs**: We need to identify descending, same-suit runs. The only viable single-card runs (since hidden cards don’t form longer valid runs) are individual bottom cards that can be placed on a target column with a top card one rank higher and same suit.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **Column B (J♦) to Column G (Q♦)**: Column B’s bottom card is J♦ (diamonds, rank 11). Column G’s bottom card is Q♦ (diamonds, rank 12). Q♦ is exactly one rank higher than J♦ and same suit, making this a valid move. Moving J♦ to G will expose column B’s hidden card (10♥) as its new bottom card.\n- **Other Potential Moves**: No other columns have bottom cards that form valid single-card runs with targets (e.g., column C’s A♣ needs 2♣, but column J’s 2♣ is a valid target, but moving A♣ to J is less impactful as it doesn’t create a longer sequence).\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving J♦ from column B to Q♦ in column G is optimal, as it uses a same-suit, consecutive rank pair and exposes a new card (10♥) that may enable future moves.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,G)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column B** has a top card of `J♦` (rank 11, suit ♦). \n- **Column G** has a top card of `Q♦` (rank 12, suit ♦). \n\nSince `J♦` (11) is exactly one rank lower than `Q♦` (12) and they share the same suit (♦), moving `J♦` from Column B to Column G is a valid move. This creates a descending, same-suit sequence (`Q♦ → J♦`) in Column G, which helps build toward completing a full K→A sequence.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,G)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board focusing on visible cards (only the bottom card of each column is face-up) and valid moves (relocating descending, same-suit runs to a column with a top card exactly one rank higher or an empty column). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Visible Cards**: Each column’s face-up card is:  \n   A:9♥, B:J♦, C:A♣, D:4♠, E:J♠, F:2♠, G:Q♦, H:9♥, I:K♣, J:2♣.  \n2. **Valid Moves**:  \n   - Moving a single face-up card (since hidden cards are unknown and cannot form runs) to a column with a top card one rank higher.  \n   - Column E’s face-up card is J♠. The only column with a top card one rank higher (Q) is G (Q♦). Moving J♠ from E to G is valid (J+1=Q).  \n3. **Strategy**: Uncovering hidden cards is critical. Moving J♠ from E will flip up the hidden card below it (3♠ in row 4 of E), enabling future moves (e.g., placing 3♠ on D’s 4♠ to form a same-suit sequence).  \n\nAnswer: (E,5,G)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the face-up cards (bottom of each column) and look for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be moved to a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- Column C’s bottom card is **A♣** (face-up), and the only potential target for A♣ is a column with a top card of **2♣** (since 2 is exactly one rank higher than A). \n- Column J’s bottom card is **2♣** (face-up), which matches the required rank and suit for A♣. \n\n### Valid Move:\nMoving A♣ from column C (row 6, the bottom card) to column J (which has 2♣ as its top card) is a valid move because:\n- A♣ (1♣) is a descending, same-suit run (length 1).\n- Column J’s top card (2♣) is exactly one rank higher than A♣.\n\nAnswer: (C,6,J)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board to identify valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column B** has a face-up card of `J♦` (row 6). The card above it (row 5) is `10♥` (hidden).\n- **Column G** has a face-up card of `Q♦` (row 5). \n\n### Valid Move:\n`J♦` (from Column B) is one rank lower than `Q♦` (from Column G) and shares the same suit (♦). This makes it a valid move to place `J♦` onto `Q♦`.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,G)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the face-up bottom cards of each column and check for valid moves where a descending, same-suit run can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Face-up cards (bottom of each column)**:  \n  A: 9♥, B: J♦, C: A♣, D: 4♠, E: 3♠, F: A♠, G: 6♥, H: 8♦, I: 10♣, J: 8♦.  \n\n- **Valid move check**:  \n  A single card (a run of 1) can be moved if the target column’s top card is one rank higher and the suit matches. Column E’s bottom card is 3♠ (spades, rank 3). Column D’s bottom card is 4♠ (spades, rank 4), which is exactly one rank higher. This makes moving 3♠ from E to D a valid move.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,D)","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board to identify valid moves. The goal is to build descending, same-suit sequences leading to complete K→A sequences. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Valid Moves**: A valid move requires relocating a descending, same-suit run onto a column whose top card is exactly one rank higher (or an empty column). Since no empty columns exist, we check single-card moves (trivial runs of length 1).\n2. **Column B (J♦)**: Column B's bottom card is J♦ (11♦). The only column with a top card one rank higher (Q♦, 12♦) is Column G. Moving J♦ to G creates a descending same-suit run (Q♦→J♦), which is a step toward building a K→Q→J... sequence.\n3. **Chain Potential**: After moving J♦ to G, Column B's new bottom card (row5: 10♥) flips face-up. This unlocks 10♥, which can later accept 9♥ from Column H (9♥ is one rank lower than 10♥, same suit), enabling further sequence building.\n\n### Best Move:\nMove J♦ from Column B (row6) to Column G to start building a descending sequence and unlock future moves.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,G)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board to identify valid moves under the rules. Only the bottom card of each column is face-up, so we focus on these visible cards. A valid move requires relocating a descending, same-suit run to a column whose top card is exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Column B (top card: J♦, rank 11, suit ♦)** can move its J♦ to **Column G (top card: Q♦, rank 12, suit ♦)**. This is valid because J♦ (rank 11) is one rank lower than Q♦ (rank 12), and both are diamonds (same suit).\n2. After moving J♦ from B to G, the new top card of Column B becomes 10♥ (previously hidden at index 5), which could enable future moves (e.g., placing 9♥ from Column A or H onto 10♥).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving J♦ from Column B to Column G is the optimal move as it builds a descending same-suit sequence (Q♦ → J♦) and reveals a new face-up card (10♥) in Column B, potentially enabling further moves.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,G)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board to identify valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card one rank higher. Here's the key reasoning:\n\n1. **Column Analysis**: Each column has a face-up bottom card (per visibility rules). We need to find runs (here, single cards) that can be moved to a column with a top card one rank higher.\n2. **Key Opportunity**: Column A has a face-up card of 6♠. The column C has a face-up card of 7♣, which is exactly one rank higher than 6♠. Moving 6♠ from A to C is valid.\n3. **Future Potential**: After moving 6♠ from A, the new bottom card in A (9♥) flips face-up. 9♥ can later be moved to column B (top card 10♥, same suit), forming a descending same-suit sequence (10♥ → 9♥), which helps build a complete K→A sequence.\n\nAnswer: (A,5,C)","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board to identify valid descending, same-suit runs and potential destinations. The goal is to build same-suit sequences toward K→A completion.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column B** has a face-up bottom card: J♦ (Jack of diamonds, rank 11).  \n- **Column G** has a face-up bottom card: Q♦ (Queen of diamonds, rank 12).  \n- J♦ (11) is exactly one rank lower than Q♦ (12), and both are diamonds (same suit).  \n\n### Valid Move:\nMoving J♦ from Column B to Column G creates a descending, same-suit run (Q♦→J♦) in Column G, which is a critical step toward building a complete K→A diamond sequence. After moving, Column B’s new bottom card (10♥) flips up, potentially enabling future moves.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,G)","\nTo determine the best next move, we analyze the visible bottom cards of each column and check for valid moves (relocating a descending, same-suit run to a column with a top card exactly one rank higher). \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Visible Bottom Cards**: Each column’s visible card is its bottom-most card (highest row index with a non-XX value). These are:  \n  A:9♥, B:J♦, C:A♣, D:4♠, E:J♠, F:2♠, G:Q♦, H:9♥, I:K♣, J:2♣.  \n\n- **Valid Moves**:  \n  - **C (A♣) → J (2♣)**: A♣ (1♣) is one rank lower than 2♣ (2♣) and same suit (clubs). Moving A♣ to J creates a descending sequence 2♣ → A♣, which is a step toward building a complete K→A sequence (since Aces form the base of such sequences).  \n  - **B (J♦) → G (Q♦)**: J♦ (11♦) is one rank lower than Q♦ (12♦) and same suit (diamonds). This creates Q♦ → J♦, a valid descending sequence but less critical than positioning an Ace.  \n\n### Decision:\nPrioritizing moves that build toward the base of sequences (Aces) is more strategic. Moving A♣ to J positions the Ace under 2♣, supporting future construction of a full K→A sequence.  \n\nAnswer: (C,6,J)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board and possible moves. The goal is to build descending same-suit sequences leading to complete K→A sequences. Here's the key reasoning:\n\n1. **Visible Cards**: Only the bottom card of each column is face-up. Columns A-D have face-up cards: A (9♥), B (J♦), C (A♣), D (4♠). Columns E-J are empty (no face-up cards).\n2. **Possible Moves**: We can move any descending, same-suit run to a column with a top card one rank higher or to an empty column. Since only single face-up cards are visible (no longer runs), we focus on moving these single cards to empty columns.\n3. **Strategic Value**: Moving A♣ (column C) to an empty column (e.g., J) is optimal. Column J has a hidden 2♣ (same suit, rank 2), which is one rank higher than A♣ (rank 1). Placing A♣ in J sets up a potential future move where 2♣ (once face-up) can be placed on A♣ to form a descending club sequence (2♣→A♣).\n\nAnswer: (C,6,J)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the face-up cards (bottom of each column) and look for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be moved to a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Face-up cards** (bottom of columns):  \n  A:9♥, B:J♦, C:A♣, D:4♠, E:J♠, F:2♠, G:Q♦, H:9♥, I:K♣, J:2♣.  \n\n- **Valid moves** must relocate a descending, same-suit run to a column with a top card one rank higher.  \n\n### Best Move:\n- **Column C** has a face-up card of A♣ (rank 1, clubs).  \n- **Column J** has a face-up card of 2♣ (rank 2, clubs).  \n- A♣ (clubs, rank 1) is exactly one rank lower than 2♣ (clubs, rank 2), forming a descending, same-suit run (2♣ → A♣).  \n\nMoving A♣ from Column C to Column J builds a same-suit (clubs) sequence, which is critical for completing a K→A club sequence (since Column I already has K♣, the top of a potential club sequence).\n\nAnswer: (C,6,J)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board focusing on valid moves that build descending, same-suit sequences, which are critical for completing K→A sequences. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Valid Moves**: A card can be moved to a column if the target’s top (face-up) card is exactly one rank higher. Only the bottom card of each column is face-up, so we focus on these.\n- **Same-Suit Priority**: Moving cards within the same suit is prioritized, as it directly contributes to building complete K→A sequences.\n\n### Analysis of Columns:\n- **Column B (J♦)**: Face-up card is J♦ (rank 11, diamonds). The target column must have a top card of Q (rank 12). \n- **Column G (Q♦)**: Face-up card is Q♦ (rank 12, diamonds).

This forms a descending, same-suit run: `A♠ → 2♠` (since `A` is one rank lower than `2` and both are spades).\n- To move this run, we need a target column whose top (face-up) card is exactly one rank higher than the top of the run (`A♠`, rank 1). The required target rank is `2`.\n- **Column J (index 9)** has a face-up card `2♣` (rank 2), which matches the required rank.

These form a descending, same-suit (spades) run: A♠ (rank 1) → 2♠ (rank 2), where each card is one rank lower than the one above (A < 2).\n- **Column E** has a top face-up card of 3♠ (index 4). The rank of 3♠ (3) is exactly one higher than the bottom card of the run in Column F (2♠, rank 2). This makes Column E a valid target for the run in Column F.\n\n### Valid Move:\nThe run in Column F (starting at index 4, including A♠ and 2♠) can be moved to Column E, as 3♠ (Column E's top card) is one rank higher than 2♠ (the bottom of the run).\n\nAnswer: (F,4,E)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board to identify valid moves based on Spider Solitaire rules.

This makes `J♦` a valid single-card run that can be moved to `Q♦`.\n\n### Impact of the Move:\nMoving `J♦` from Column B to Column G will expose the hidden card in Column B (row 5: `10♥`), which becomes the new face-up card. This increases the visibility of cards and potential future moves.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,G)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the face-up cards (bottom of each column) and check for valid moves where a descending, same-suit run can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column B** has a face-up bottom card: J♦ (rank 11, suit ♦).  \n- **Column G** has a face-up bottom card: Q♦ (rank 12, suit ♦).  \n- Q♦ is exactly one rank higher than J♦, and both are ♦. This makes moving J♦ from B to G a valid move.  \n\n### Benefit of This Move:\nMoving J♦ from B to G will reveal the hidden card above J♦ in column B (row 5: 10♥), which will flip face-up. This 10♥ (rank 10, suit ♥) can later be moved to column A, which has a face-up 9♥ (rank 9, suit ♥), forming a descending sequence (10♥ → 9♥).

This makes moving `J♦` from Column B to Column G a valid move.  \n\n### Reasoning:\nMoving `J♦` (Column B, index 6) to `Q♦` (Column G) creates a descending same-suit sequence `Q♦ → J♦`. After this move, the new bottom card of Column B (originally hidden `10♥` at index 5) flips face-up.

The top cards are:  \n  A: 10♣ (index 5), B: 6♥ (index 5), C: 8♠ (index 5), D: 5♥ (index 5), E: J♣ (index 4), F: 10♥ (index 4), G: 8♦ (index 4), H: 9♣ (index 4), I: Q♦ (index 4), J: 6♣ (index 4).  \n\n- **Valid Moves**: A single card (or longer run) can be moved to a column with a top card exactly one rank higher and the same suit.  \n\n### Candidate Moves:\n1. **Move 9♣ (H, index 4) to 10♣ (A, index 5)**:  \n   - 9♣ (rank 9) is one rank lower than 10♣ (rank 10) and shares the same suit (♣).  \n   - This creates a 10♣-9♣ run in column A, a descending same-suit sequence.  \n   - Moving 9♣ from H reveals the hidden card below it (index 3 in column H), which may help build longer runs.  \n\n2. **Other Moves**:  \n   - 5♥ (D, index 5) could move to 6♥ (B, index 5) (5♥ < 6♥, same suit), but this builds a lower-value sequence (6-5♥) compared to 10-9♣.  \n   - 10♣ (A, index 5) could move to J♣ (E, index 4) (10♣ < J♣, same suit), but this leaves column A with a hidden card that may not immediately contribute to a longer run.  \n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 9♣ (H) to 10♣ (A) prioritizes building a higher-value, same-suit run (10♣-9♣), which is closer to forming a K→A sequence. Revealing the hidden card in column H also increases future options.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,A)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible top cards of each column and check for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column A** has a top card of `10♣` (rank 10, suit clubs). \n- **Column E** has a top card of `J♣` (rank 11, suit clubs). \n\nSince `10♣` is exactly one rank lower than `J♣` and both are clubs (same suit), moving `10♣` from Column A to Column E forms a valid descending, same-suit run (`J♣-10♣`). This move helps build a longer sequence in clubs, which is a step toward completing a full K→A sequence.\n\nAnswer: (A,5,E)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible bottom cards of each column and check for valid descending, same-suit sequences that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column D** has a bottom card of `5♥` (index 5, face-up). \n- **Column B** has a bottom card of `6♥` (index 5, face-up). \n- `5♥` is exactly one rank lower than `6♥` and shares the same suit (hearts). This makes it a valid move to place `5♥` onto `6♥`.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,B)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible face-up cards (bottom of each column) and look for valid moves that build descending, same-suit sequences, which are critical for forming complete K→A sequences. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Face-up Cards**: Each column has only one face-up card (the bottom card). Valid moves involve relocating these single cards to columns where the target’s face-up card is exactly one rank higher.\n- **Same-Suit Priority**: Moves that stack same-suit cards are prioritized, as they directly contribute to building complete sequences.\n\n### Valid Moves:\n- **10♣ (Column A, row 5)**: Can move to J♣ (Column E, row 4) since J (11) is one rank higher than 10 (10), and both are clubs (same suit). This builds a potential J→10 sequence in clubs.\n- **9♣ (Column H, row 4)**: Can move to 10♣ (Column A, row 5) (10 is one rank higher than 9, same suit), but this would only build a 10→9 sequence, which is less advanced than J→10.\n- **5♥ (Column D, row 5)**: Can move to 6♥ (Column B, row 5) (6 is one rank higher than 5, same suit), but this builds a less critical 6→5 sequence in hearts.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 10♣ (A5) to J♣ (E4) prioritizes building a higher-value, same-suit sequence (clubs), which is more likely to contribute to a complete K→A sequence.\n\nAnswer: (A,5,E)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible top cards of each column and look for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column E** has a top card of J♣ (Jack of clubs). A valid move requires a run ending with 10♣ (one rank lower, same suit). \n- **Column A** has a top card of 10♣ (index 5), which is a single-card run (trivially descending) and matches the required rank and suit for placement on Column E. \n\n### Valid Move:\nMoving the 10♣ from Column A (index 5) to Column E is legal because:\n- The run (10♣) is descending (trivially) and same-suit (clubs).\n- Column E’s top card (J♣) is exactly one rank higher than 10♣.\n\nAnswer: (A,5,E)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board state and possible legal moves.

Column E’s top card is J♣ (rank 11, Clubs). Since 10 is exactly one rank lower than 11 and they share the same suit (Clubs), 10♣ can be moved to E. This creates a descending same-suit run (J♣→10♣) in E, which is closer to forming a K→A sequence (needing Q♣, K♣ next).\n\n2. **Column H (9♣) to Column A (10♣)**:  \n   Column H’s top card is 9♣ (rank 9, Clubs). Column A’s top card is 10♣ (rank 10, Clubs). This is also a valid move (9→10, same suit), but it creates a shorter run (10♣→9♣) compared to the first option.\n\n3. **Column D (5♥) to Column B (6♥)**:  \n   Column D’s top card is 5♥ (rank 5, Hearts). Column B’s top card is 6♥ (rank 6, Hearts). This is valid (5→6, same suit) but builds a lower-rank sequence (6♥→5♥), which is less critical for completing K→A sequences.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 10♣ from A to J♣ in E prioritizes building higher-rank sequences (J→10), which are closer to completing a K→A sequence.

Only the bottom card of each column is face-up, so all potential moves involve single-card runs (since hidden cards cannot form valid same-suit descending sequences).  \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Valid Moves**:  \n   - Column C (top card: 7♣) can accept a 6♣ (one rank lower, same suit). Columns B (6♣, row5) and E (6♣, row4) both have 6♣, so moving either to C is valid.  \n   - Column G (top card: 3♥) can accept a 2♥ (one rank lower, same suit). Column J (2♥, row4) has 2♥, so moving it to G is valid.  \n\n### Evaluation of Options:\n- Moving 6♣ (from B or E) to C builds a 7♣-6♣ sequence but relies on hidden cards (row4 of B or row3 of E) to extend further.  \n- Moving 2♥ (from J) to G builds a 3♥-2♥ sequence, which is closer to completing a K→A sequence (since 2 is nearer to Ace). This move directly progresses a lower portion of a potential sequence, which is often more critical in Spider Solitaire to free up lower ranks for eventual Ace placement.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most strategic move is to build the 3♥-2♥ sequence in column G, as it advances a lower portion of a potential suit sequence, increasing the likelihood of completing a full K→A sequence later.  \n\nAnswer: (J,4,G)","\n\nTo determine the best next action, we analyze the current board to identify valid moves. The goal is to relocate descending, same-suit runs onto columns with a top card exactly one rank higher (or empty columns, though none exist here). \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Visible Top Cards**: Each column’s top visible card is checked for potential moves. All visible runs are single cards (no longer descending, same-suit sequences).\n- **Valid Moves**: \n  - Column J’s top card (2♥) can move to Column G (3♥) since 2♥ is one rank lower and same suit (hearts).\n  - Columns B and E’s top cards (6♣) can move to Column C (7♣) since 6♣ is one rank lower and same suit (clubs).\n\n### Best Move Selection:\nMoving 2♥ from Column J to 3♥ in Column G creates a 2-card descending, same-suit run (3♥ → 2♥).

This creates a descending sequence `3♥ → 2♥` in Column G, which is a step toward building a complete K→A sequence.\n\nOther potential moves (e.g., moving `6♣` from Columns B\/E to Column C) are valid but less critical, as lower ranks (like `2♥` and `3♥`) are closer to the Ace, which is necessary to complete a sequence.

Since 7♣ is one rank higher than 6♣ and they share the same suit (♣), this is a valid move.  \n2. **Move 6♣ from Column B to Column C**:  \n   Column B’s bottom card is 6♣ (rank 6), and Column C’s bottom card is 7♣ (rank 7). This is also valid but Column B has more hidden cards (6 total) compared to Column E (5 total), so revealing a new card in Column E may provide more immediate information.  \n3. **Move 2♥ from Column J to Column G**:  \n   Column J’s bottom card is 2♥ (rank 2), and Column G’s bottom card is 3♥ (rank 3). This is valid but involves lower ranks, which are less critical for building longer sequences immediately.  \n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 6♣ from Column E to Column C is optimal. It builds a 2-card descending, same-suit sequence (7♣ → 6♣) in clubs, a suit with multiple visible cards (6♣, 7♣), increasing the potential to extend the sequence with hidden cards above 7♣ in Column C.  \n\nAnswer: (E,4,C)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards and apply the game rules. Only the bottom card of each column is face-up, so we can only move single face-up cards (since longer runs require consecutive visible, same-suit, descending cards, which are not present here). A valid move requires placing a card onto another column whose top (face-up) card is exactly one rank higher and of the same suit.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column J** has a bottom card of `2♥` (face-up). \n- **Column G** has a bottom card of `3♥` (face-up). \n- `2♥` is exactly one rank lower than `3♥` and shares the same suit (hearts). This makes moving `2♥` from Column J to Column G a valid move.\n\n### Reasoning:\nMoving `2♥` from Column J to Column G creates a descending, same-suit sequence (`3♥ → 2♥`) in Column G. This advances the progress toward building a complete K→A sequence (ultimate goal) by extending a lower-rank sequence, which is closer to the Ace (the final card needed to complete a sequence).\n\nAnswer: (J,4,G)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards and possible legal moves. Each column's bottom (face-up) card is:  \n- A: K♠, B: 6♣, C: 7♣, D: 9♦, E: 6♣, F: J♦, G: 3♥, H: 3♠, I: 2♦, J: 2♥.  \n\nA legal move requires relocating a descending, same-suit run to a column with a top card exactly one rank higher (or an empty column).

Moving 6♣ from E to C creates a 7♣-6♣ sequence, which is a valid descending run.  \n2. **Column J (2♥)**: The top card of column G is 3♥ (same suit, one rank higher). Moving 2♥ from J to G creates a 3♥-2♥ sequence, also valid.  \n\nBetween these, moving 6♣ to C is more strategic because 7♣-6♣ is a higher-ranked sequence (closer to building a K→A sequence) compared to 3♥-2♥.

This makes it a valid candidate to move to Column C.  \n3. Moving 6♣ from Column E (index 4) to Column C will create a descending, same-suit sequence (7♣ → 6♣) and flip the hidden card at Column E, index 3, potentially revealing a useful card for future moves.  \n\nOther potential moves (e.g., moving 2♥ from Column J to Column G) are less impactful, as building a higher-rank sequence (7♣ → 6♣) is more strategic for forming complete K→A sequences.  \n\nAnswer: (E,4,C)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible top cards of each column and look for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Visible Top Cards**: Columns A-D have 6 cards (rows 0-5), with top cards K♠ (A), 6♣ (B), 7♣ (C), and 9♦ (D). Columns E-J have 5 cards (rows 0-4), with top cards 6♣ (E), J♦ (F), 3♥ (G), 3♠ (H), 2♦ (I), and 2♥ (J).\n- **Valid Moves**: We need to move a same-suit, descending run onto a column with a top card one rank higher. Since only top cards are visible, we focus on single-card moves.\n- **Same-Suit Advantage**: Moving same-suit cards helps build longer sequences, which is critical for completing K→A sequences.\n\n### Best Move:\nColumn B has a top card of 6♣ (clubs), and column C has a top card of 7♣ (clubs). Since 7♣ is exactly one rank higher than 6♣ and both are clubs, moving 6♣ from B to C creates a same-suit descending run (7♣-6♣). This move is optimal because it builds a same-suit sequence and exposes the hidden card below 6♣ in column B (row 4), potentially revealing new opportunities.\n\nAnswer: (B,5,C)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards and potential legal moves. The goal is to build descending, same-suit runs to eventually form complete K→A sequences. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Visible Cards**: Each column has only its bottom card visible. The visible cards are:  \n   - A: K♠, B: 6♣, C: 7♣, D: 9♦, E: 6♣, F: J♦, G: 3♥, H: 3♠, I: 2♦, J: 2♥.  \n\n2. **Legal Moves**: A single card can be moved to a column whose top card is exactly one rank higher.

This is also valid (6♣ is one rank lower than 7♣, same suit). However, Column B has more hidden cards (5 hidden cards above 6♣) compared to Column E (4 hidden cards above 6♣), so exposing a new card in Column E (shorter column) is more likely to reveal useful cards sooner.\n\n3. **Move 2♥ (Column J) to 3♥ (Column G)**:  \n   Column J’s top card is 2♥ (index 4), and Column G’s top card is 3♥ (index 4).

This hides 7♣ and reveals no new cards in column E (since E has 5 cards, moving its bottom card leaves 4 hidden cards).\n3. **Column B (6♣) → Column C (7♣)**: 6♣ (rank 6) can move to 7♣ (rank 7, same suit). Column B has 6 cards; moving its bottom card (index 5) reveals the hidden card at index 4, increasing visibility for future moves.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 6♣ from column B to column C is optimal because it uncovers a new hidden card in column B, which may enable future moves.

All other cards are hidden (XX).\n- **Valid Moves**: A single face-up card (since longer runs require consecutive face-up cards) can be moved to a column whose face-up card is exactly one rank higher (same suit) or to an empty column (none exist here).\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n1. **Move 2♥ (Column J) to 3♥ (Column G)**:  \n   Column J’s bottom card is 2♥ (face-up), and Column G’s bottom card is 3♥ (face-up). Since 2♥ is one rank lower than 3♥ and both are hearts (same suit), this is a valid move. Moving 2♥ to G creates a potential descending heart sequence (3♥ → 2♥), which can be extended if higher heart cards (e.g., 4♥) are revealed later.\n\n2. **Move 6♣ (Column B\/E) to 7♣ (Column C)**:  \n   Columns B and E have 6♣ (face-up), and Column C has 7♣ (face-up). 6♣ is one rank lower than 7♣ (same suit), making this a valid move. However, moving 6♣ to C creates a club sequence (7♣ → 6♣), but 6♣ is less critical for building longer sequences compared to lower-ranked cards like 2♥.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 2♥ (Column J) to 3♥ (Column G) is optimal because it starts a descending heart sequence with lower-ranked cards, which are closer to completing a K→A sequence (needs A→K). This move also reveals a new hidden card in Column J, potentially unlocking future moves.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,G)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible face-up cards and potential legal moves. Only the bottom card of each column is face-up, so we focus on moving single cards (runs of 1) to columns with a top card exactly one rank higher.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Face-up Cards**: Columns have bottom cards: K♠ (A), 6♣ (B), 7♣ (C), 9♦ (D), 6♣ (E), J♦ (F), 3♥ (G), 3♠ (H), 2♦ (I), 2♥ (J).\n2. **Valid Moves**: A single card (run of 1) can move to a column with a top card one rank higher. For example:\n   - 2♥ (J, rank 2) can move to G (3♥, rank 3) since 3 is one higher than 2.\n   - This creates a same-suit run (3♥, 2♥), which is valuable for building longer descending sequences.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 2♥ from column J (index 4) to column G (which has 3♥ at index 4) creates a same-suit run (3♥, 2♥). This run can later be extended if a 4♥ is revealed, contributing to building a complete K→A sequence.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,G)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board and valid moves based on Spider Solitaire rules. The goal is to build descending, same-suit sequences leading to complete K→A sequences.

Columns A-D have 6 cards (rows 0-5, with row 5 face-up), while columns E-J have 5 cards (rows 0-4, with row 4 face-up).\n- **Valid Moves**: A move requires relocating a descending, same-suit run onto a column with a top card exactly one rank higher (or an empty column, but there are none here).\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n1. **Column J (2♥) to Column G (3♥)**:  \n   Column J’s bottom card is 2♥ (hearts), and column G’s bottom card is 3♥ (hearts). Since 3♥ is exactly one rank higher than 2♥ and they share the same suit, this is a valid move. Moving 2♥ to 3♥ builds a descending heart sequence (3♥, 2♥), which is a step toward completing a K→A heart sequence.\n\n2. **Column E (6♣) or B (6♣) to Column C (7♣)**:  \n   Columns E and B have 6♣ (clubs), and column C has 7♣ (clubs). 7♣ is one rank higher than 6♣, so these are also valid moves. However, these moves build a club sequence (7♣, 6♣), which is less urgent than building lower-rank sequences (closer to A) like 3♥, 2♥.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 2♥ (J) to 3♥ (G) prioritizes building a lower-rank sequence, which is critical for eventually forming a complete K→A sequence (since A is the lowest rank). This move directly contributes to progress in the heart suit, making it the most strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,G)","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards and apply the game rules. The goal is to build descending, same-suit sequences.

Moving 6♣ to C creates a descending sequence (7♣ → 6♣), which is a step toward building a full K→A sequence.  \n\n2. **Other Options**:  \n   - Moving 2♥ (Column J) to 3♥ (Column G) is valid but creates a lower-rank sequence (3♥ → 2♥), which is less critical for building full sequences.  \n   - Moving 6♣ (Column B) to 7♣ (Column C) is also valid, but Column E has fewer cards (5 cards) compared to Column B (6 cards). Moving from E exposes a new card sooner (index 3), which may help future moves.  \n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 6♣ from Column E to Column C prioritizes building a higher-rank sequence (7♣ → 6♣), which is more valuable for completing K→A sequences.  \n\nAnswer: (E,4,C)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current board for valid descending, same-suit runs that can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Column J** has a top card of `2♥` (hearts). \n- **Column G** has a top card of `3♥` (hearts). \n- `2♥` is exactly one rank lower than `3♥` and shares the same suit (hearts), making it a valid move to place `2♥` under `3♥`.\n\n### Valid Move:\nMoving `2♥` from Column J (index 4) to Column G will create a descending, same-suit run (`3♥-2♥`), which helps build toward a complete K→A sequence. \n\nAnswer: (J,4,G)","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible cards and possible legal moves.

Since only the bottom card of each column is visible, we focus on single-card moves (trivial runs of length 1).  \n\n### Candidate Moves:\n1. **Move 2♥ from J to G**: Column J’s bottom card is 2♥ (rank 2, suit ♥). Column G’s bottom card is 3♥ (rank 3, suit ♥). 3♥ is exactly one rank higher than 2♥, and they share the same suit.

Moving 6♣ from B or E to C creates a 7♣-6♣ sequence.\n\n### Evaluation:\n- Moving 2♥ (J) to 3♥ (G) builds a lower-section heart sequence (3♥-2♥), which is closer to completing a K→A sequence (needing A♥ next). Revealing the new bottom card in J (previously hidden) may uncover useful cards (e.g., A♥).\n- While moving 6♣ (B\/E) to 7♣ (C) builds a middle-section club sequence, it hides the 7♣ (now under 6♣), reducing visibility of higher cards. \n\nGiven the epoch is 89\/100 (near the turn limit), prioritizing lower-section sequences (closer to A) is more urgent.

This makes it a valid move to place `4♠` onto `5♠`.\n\nOther potential moves (e.g., `4♥` from F to `5♥` on I) are also valid but this move is prioritized as it maintains focus on building same-suit sequences, which is critical for completing K→A sequences.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,H)","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the visible face-up cards (bottom of each column) and check for valid moves where a descending, same-suit run can be placed on a column with a top card exactly one rank higher. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- All columns have non-empty face-up cards (no empty columns).\n- Valid moves require moving a single face-up card (since hidden cards are unknown) to a column where the target’s face-up card is one rank higher and same suit.\n\n### Valid Moves:\n1. **Column D (4♠) to Column C (5♠)**: 4♠ (rank 4) can move to C, where the face-up card is 5♠ (rank 5, same suit).\n2. **Column D (4♠) to Column H (5♠)**: 4♠ can also move to H, which has a 5♠ (same suit, one rank higher).\n3. **Column F (4♥) to Column I (5♥)**: 4♥ (rank 4) can move to I, where the face-up card is 5♥ (rank 5, same suit).\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving 4♠ from D to C is optimal because it builds a descending spade sequence (5♠ → 4♠), which aligns with the goal of forming complete K→A sequences.

Since 5 is exactly one rank higher than 4 and the suits match, `4♠` from Column D can be moved to either Column C or H. \n- **Column F** has a visible top card of `4♥` (rank 4, suit ♥), and **Column I** has a visible top card of `5♥` (rank 5, suit ♥). This also allows moving `4♥` from F to I. \n\n### Strategy:\nBuilding same-suit sequences is critical for completing K→A sequences. Spades are more common among visible top cards (5♠ in C, 4♠ in D, 5♠ in H, 2♠ in E, 10♠ in J), making spade sequences more likely to be extendable.
