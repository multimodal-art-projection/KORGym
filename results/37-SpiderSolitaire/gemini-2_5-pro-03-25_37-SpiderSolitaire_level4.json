There are no possible moves between the face-up cards. For example, the J♥ in column A cannot move to either K (different suits), the 6♥ in B cannot move to the 8♠ or 3♥, the 8♠ in C cannot move to A♣ or K♠, the A♣ in D cannot move to Q♣, the 3♥ in G cannot move to 4♦, the Q♣ in I cannot move to either K. The Kings and Aces cannot be moved onto anything. Since no moves are possible and all columns have cards, the only option is to deal new cards.\n2.  Answer: hit","Reasoning: The primary goal early in Spider Solitaire is to expose hidden cards. Moving the 3♣ from column H (starting at index 4) onto the 4♣ in column F reveals the hidden card at H,3. This also builds a small same-suit sequence (4♣-3♣). Other moves expose face-up cards or build sequences but revealing hidden cards offers the most potential for future moves.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,F)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Identify potential moves:** Look for cards or sequences that can be moved onto another column's top card (must be one rank higher).\n    *   Q♠ (G,5) can move to K♣ (D,6) or K♣ (J,6).\n    *   3♣ (H,4) can move to 4♣ (F,6).\n    *   Q♦ (I,7) can move to K♣ (D,6) or K♣ (J,6).\n    *   3♥ (J,7) can move to 4♣ (F,6).\n2.  **Evaluate moves based on goals:**\n    *   **Uncover hidden cards (XX):** Moving 3♣ from H (H,4,F) will uncover the card at H,3. This is generally the highest priority.\n    *   **Build same-suit sequences:** Moving 3♣ onto 4♣ (H,4,F) creates a 4♣-3♣ sequence. This is beneficial for eventually clearing a full sequence.\n    *   **Reveal known cards:** Moving Q♠ (G,5,D or G,5,J) reveals K♦ at G,4. Moving Q♦ (I,7,D or I,7,J) reveals Q♥ at I,6. Moving 3♥ (J,7,F) reveals K♣ at J,6. Revealing known cards is less valuable than uncovering hidden ones.\n    *   **Create empty columns:** None of these moves create an empty column.\n3.  **Compare best options:**\n    *   (H,4,F): Uncovers a hidden card AND builds a same-suit sequence.\n    *   (J,7,F): Reveals K♣ (already known), builds a mixed-suit sequence.\n    *   (G,5,D\/J): Reveals K♦, builds mixed-suit sequence.\n    *   (I,7,D\/J): Reveals Q♥, builds mixed-suit sequence.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The move (H,4,F) is the best because it achieves the primary goal of uncovering a hidden card and the secondary goal of building a same-suit sequence.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,F)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards to find potential moves and sequences.\n2.  Several moves are available that achieve this by moving a single card onto another of the same suit and one rank higher.\n    *   (A,8,F): Move 9♣ onto 10♣. Reveals A[7].\n    *   (B,9,D): Move 8♦ onto 9♦. Reveals B[8].\n    *   (E,7,B): Move A♠ onto 2♠. Reveals E[6].\n    *   (G,6,C): Move 9♠ onto 10♠. Reveals G[5].\n    *   (H,7,G): Move 6♠ onto 7♠. Reveals H[6].\n    *   (I,8,A): Move 8♥ onto 9♥. Reveals I[7].\n    *   (J,7,H): Move 3♥ onto 4♥. Reveals J[6].\n3.  All these moves are beneficial. However, revealing Kings is often very useful as they are needed to start full sequences or can help clear columns if moved to an empty space later.\n4.  Move (J,7,H) moves the 3♥ from column J onto the 4♥ in column H. This reveals the card at index 6 in column J (J[6]), which happens to be K♣. Uncovering a King is generally a high-priority action.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning: The move (J,7,H) places the 3♥ onto the 4♥ in column H. This builds a small same-suit sequence (4♥-3♥) which is beneficial. More importantly, this move flips the card at index 6 in column J (J[6]), revealing a K♣. Uncovering hidden cards, especially Kings, is a primary objective in Spider Solitaire as it opens up future moves and helps in organizing sequences.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning: The goal is to uncover hidden cards and build sequences, prioritizing moves that reveal Kings or create opportunities for further plays.\nSeveral moves are possible:\n1.  (J,7,H): Move 3♥ onto 4♥. This exposes the K♣ at J,6. Exposing Kings is a high priority.\n2.  (H,6,I): Move J♦ onto Q♦. This exposes 4♥ at H,5 and builds a J♦-Q♦ sequence. This enables move (J,7,H) on the next turn, which would then expose K♣.\n3.  (I,7,G): Move Q♦ onto K♦. This exposes 8♥ at I,6 and builds onto a King.\n4.  (G,6,C): Move 9♠ onto 10♠. This exposes Q♠ at G,5 and builds a 9♠-10♠ sequence.\n5.  (C,8,A): Move 10♠ onto J♠. This exposes A♥ at C,7 and builds a 10♠-J♠ sequence.\n\nComparing these, move (J,7,H) directly exposes a King (K♣), which is generally the most impactful type of card to reveal. While move (H,6,I) sets up the King exposure for the next turn while also building a sequence, directly exposing the King now seems slightly stronger as it guarantees the reveal. Move (I,7,G) is also strong as it builds onto a King, but exposing an 8♥ is less impactful than exposing a K♣. Therefore, exposing the K♣ via (J,7,H) is the chosen action.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to build same-suit descending sequences (K->A) and reveal hidden cards.\n2.  There are no chances left to 'hit', so we must make moves from the current board.\n3.  We look for moves that consolidate cards of the same suit, especially if they reveal a hidden card.\n4.  Moving G9♠ onto C10♠ (G,6,C) achieves this:\n    *   It creates a same-suit sequence: 10♠-9♠ in column C.\n    *   It reveals the card at G6.\n    *   It sets up a potential future move: moving the 10♠-9♠ sequence from column C onto the J♠ in column A to create an even longer sequence (J♠-10♠-9♠).\n\nOther good moves exist, like E A♠ onto B2♠ (E,8,B) or C10♠ onto A J♠ (C,8,A), but (G,6,C) enables a longer sequence build in the near future while also revealing a card.\n\nAnswer: (G,6,C)","Reasoning: Moving the 3♥ from column J onto the 4♥ in column H builds a same-suit sequence (4♥-3♥). This move reveals the card at index 6 in column J, which is K♣. Uncovering Kings is generally useful. This move also sets up a potential follow-up move: transferring the 4♥-3♥ sequence onto the 5♥ in column B.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning: Moving the 3♥ from column J onto the 4♥ in column H builds a small sequence (4♥-3♥). More significantly, this move uncovers the K♣ card in column J. Revealing face-down cards, particularly Kings which can only start sequences in empty columns or be built upon if already at the top, is a key strategy for making progress.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","*Reasoning:*\n1.  **Goal:** Reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences, especially K->A.\n2.  **Constraint:** No 'hit' available. Must work with the current board.\n3.  **Evaluate potential moves:** Several moves are possible that reveal a card. We prioritize moves that either reveal high-value cards (like Kings), create or extend same-suit runs, or enable strong follow-up moves.\n4.  **Identify promising candidates:**\n    *   (E,7,B): Move A♠ onto 2♠. Reveals 5♠. Creates 2♠-A♠ (same suit). Enables follow-up (E,6,H) moving 5♠ onto 6♠.\n    *   (J,6,F): Move 3♥ onto 4♣. Reveals K♣ in column J. Enables follow-up (A,6,J) moving Q♣ onto K♣.\n    *   (B,9,D): Move 8♦ onto 9♦. Reveals A♠. Creates 9♦-8♦ (same suit).\n    *   (G,6,C): Move 9♠ onto 10♠. Reveals Q♠. Creates 10♠-9♠ (same suit).\n5.  **Compare best candidates:**\n    *   The sequence starting with (J,6,F) reveals K♣, then allows placing Q♣ on it (same suit), revealing J♠. This uncovers high cards and builds directly towards a K->A sequence.\n    *   The sequence starting with (E,7,B) reveals 5♠, then 7♣, creating two short same-suit runs.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Revealing a King and immediately placing the corresponding Queen on it ((J,6,F) followed by (A,6,J)) is strategically superior as it significantly progresses towards clearing a sequence and uncovers high-value cards. Therefore, the initial move (J,6,F) is the best choice.\n\nAnswer: (J,6,F)","Reasoning: The most beneficial moves currently involve revealing hidden cards, as there are no more 'hit' opportunities. Moving A♠ from column E onto the 2♠ in column B achieves this by uncovering the card at E[6]. Additionally, this move creates a valuable three-card same-suit sequence (3♠-2♠-A♠) in column B, consolidating cards and progressing towards building a full sequence.\n\nAnswer: (E,7,B)","Reasoning: The best move is generally one that reveals a hidden card or builds a same-suit sequence. Moving the 10♠ from column C onto the J♠ in column A achieves both: it reveals the card at C[5] and creates the J♠-10♠ sequence in column A. This sequence is the highest-ranking same-suit sequence buildable right now.\n\nAnswer: (C,6,A)","Reasoning: The primary goals are to expose hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Moving the 10♠ from column C onto the J♠ in column A achieves both. It creates a J♠-10♠ sequence and exposes the A♥ underneath the 10♠. This A♥ can then immediately be moved onto the 2♥ in column D, creating another sequence (2♥-A♥) and exposing another hidden card in column C. This sequence of moves builds structure and progresses towards uncovering columns.\n\nAnswer: (C,8,A,5)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Reveal hidden cards and build sequences. Hits are unavailable.\n2.  **Identify Same-Suit Moves:** Look for moves where a card or sequence can be placed on another card of the same suit and one rank higher.\n    *   9♠ (G, index 7) can move onto 10♠ (C, index 7). This forms a 10♠-9♠ sequence.\n    *   3♥ (J, index 7) can move onto 4♥ (H, index 6). This forms a 4♥-3♥ sequence.\n    *   Q♣ (A, index 6) can move onto K♣ (D, index 6). This forms a K♣-Q♣ sequence.\n    *   7♦ (A, index 7) can move onto 8♦ (B, index 9). This forms an 8♦-7♦ sequence.\n    *   9♣ (A, index 8) can move onto 10♣ (F, index 6). This forms a 10♣-9♣ sequence.\n    *   8♦ (B, index 9) can move onto 9♦ (D, index 7). This forms a 9♦-8♦ sequence.\n    *   A♠ (E, index 8) can move onto 2♠ (B, index 6). This forms a 2♠-A♠ sequence.\n    *   Q♦ (I, index 8) can move onto K♦ (G, index 5). This forms a K♦-Q♦ sequence.\n3.  **Evaluate:** All the above moves reveal a hidden card and build a same-suit sequence, which are high-priority actions. Moving 9♠ onto 10♠ (G,7,C) is a good option as it builds towards a spade sequence and reveals the card G[6].\n\nAnswer: (G,7,C)","**Reasoning:**\n1.  The goal is to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences (K->A).\n2.  There are several possible moves that build same-suit runs and uncover a card:\n    *   (G,2,C): Move 9♠ onto 10♠. Creates (10♠, 9♠), uncovers Q♠.\n    *   (H,3,F): Move 6♠ onto 7♠. Creates (7♠, 6♠), uncovers J♦.\n    *   (I,3,G): Move Q♦ onto K♦. Creates (K♦, Q♦), uncovers 8♥.\n    *   (J,3,H): Move 3♥ onto 4♥. Creates (4♥, 3♥), uncovers K♣.\n    *   (B,4,D): Move 8♦ onto 9♦. Creates (9♦, 8♦), uncovers A♠.\n    *   (A,3,F): Move 9♣ onto 10♣. Creates (10♣, 9♣), uncovers 7♦.\n3.  Consider the move (H,3,F): Moving 6♠ from H onto 7♠ in F uncovers J♦ in column H.\n4.  After this move, the J♦ (now at H,2) can be moved onto the Q♦ in column I via the move (H,2,I). This second move uncovers the 4♥ in column H.\n5.  This sequence of two moves uncovers two cards (J♦ then 4♥) and creates\/extends two same-suit runs ((7♠, 6♠) and (Q♦, J♦)). This offers more progress than the other single moves available. Therefore, starting with (H,3,F) is the best first step.\n\nAnswer: (H,3,F)","Reasoning: Several moves are possible that expose a hidden card. Moving the Q♦ from column I onto the K♦ in column G creates a K♦-Q♦ sequence, which is strategically valuable as it starts building a sequence from the King down. This also turns over a hidden card in column I. Other moves like (E,8,B), (H,7,G), (J,7,B), and (B,9,D) also expose hidden cards and create small runs, but initiating a sequence from a King is generally a high priority.\nAnswer: (I,7,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. We have no more 'hit' chances, so revealing cards is crucial.\n2.  **Evaluate Moves:**\n    *   Moving 10♠ from Column C (index 8) onto J♠ in Column A (index 5) creates a J♠-10♠ sequence. This is good for building towards a full spade sequence.\n    *   This move reveals the card at C,7, which is A♥.\n    *   Revealing A♥ immediately opens up a potential subsequent move: moving A♥ (C,7) onto 2♥ (D,5).\n    *   Other moves like moving J♦ (H,6) to Q♦ (I,7) or moving Q♦ (H,8 or I,7) to K♦ (G,4) are also good as they reveal cards and build sequences, but consolidating the spade suit from J down seems strategically stronger, and the revealed A♥ offers a clear follow-up.\n\nAnswer: (C,8,A)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to build K->A sequences of the same suit.\n2.  Several moves allow building same-suit sequences: (E,7,B) A♠->2♠, (G,6,C) 9♠->10♠, (H,4,F) 3♣->4♣, (I,7,G) Q♦->K♦, (J,4,I) 8♥->9♥.\n3.  Moving Q♦ onto K♦ (I,7,G) progresses a sequence starting from the King, which is highly desirable. It also reveals the card beneath Q♦ in column I (8♥).\n4.  Other moves like (J,4,I) are also good (revealing Q♥ and setting up a potential K♣ reveal), but building directly onto an existing King (K♦) is generally a stronger strategic move in Spider Solitaire.\n\nAnswer: (I,7,G)","Reasoning: There are several possible moves that build same-suit sequences and reveal hidden cards.\n- (E,7,B): Moves A♠ onto 2♠, reveals 5♠, builds 2♠-A♠.\n- (H,7,F): Moves 6♠ onto 7♠, reveals J♦, builds 7♠-6♠.\n- (J,7,H): Moves 3♥ onto 4♥, reveals K♣, builds 4♥-3♥.\n- (I,7,G): Moves Q♦ onto K♦, reveals 8♥, builds K♦-Q♦.\n\nMoving Q♦ onto K♦ (I,7,G) starts building a sequence from the King down, which is strategically valuable. It also uncovers a new card (8♥) and keeps other good options like (E,7,B), (H,7,F), and (J,7,H) available for subsequent turns.\n\nAnswer: (I,7,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Reveal hidden cards and build sequences towards completion. No more 'hit' available.\n2.  **Identify potential moves:** Several moves are possible, including building same-suit sequences, moving Kings to the empty column, and revealing cards.\n    *   (E,6,G): K♣ to empty G. Reveals E5(5♠). Creates empty column.\n    *   (E,4,H): 2♣ onto 3♣. Reveals E3(XX). Builds 3♣,2♣.\n    *   (H,4,F): 3♣ onto 4♣. Reveals H3(XX). Builds 10♣,4♣,3♣.\n    *   (I,7,H): Q♦ onto K♦. Reveals I6(8♥). Builds K♦,Q♦. Enables potential 8♥->9♥ move.\n    *   (J,7,H): 3♥ onto 4♥. Reveals J6(K♣). Builds 4♥,3♥. Enables potential K♣->G move.\n    *   (J,4,I): 8♥ onto 9♥. Reveals J3(XX). Builds 9♥,8♥.\n3.  **Prioritize:** Revealing hidden cards is crucial since no more cards can be dealt. Moves (E,4,H), (H,4,F), and (J,4,I) achieve this directly.\n4.  **Compare direct reveals:**\n    *   (E,4,H): Reveals E3(XX), builds 2-card run (3♣,2♣).\n    *   (H,4,F): Reveals H3(XX), builds 3-card run (10♣,4♣,3♣).\n    *   (J,4,I): Reveals J3(XX), builds 2-card run (9♥,8♥).\n5.  **Select best reveal:** (H,4,F) reveals a hidden card *and* builds the longest same-suit sequence among the direct reveal options (3 cards). This consolidation is beneficial, and revealing the hidden card progresses the game towards uncovering necessary cards. Moves like (J,7,H) or (I,7,H) are tempting as they enable further moves, but revealing a known card (K♣ or 8♥) is less valuable immediately than revealing an unknown card when the deck is empty.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,F)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Identify Potential Moves:** Several moves are possible that involve moving a single card onto another card of the next higher rank. Moves building same-suit sequences are generally preferred.\n    *   (A,8,C): 9♣ -> 10♠ (wrong suit) - Reveals 7♦\n    *   (B,9,D): 8♦ -> 9♦ (same suit) - Reveals A♠\n    *   (C,9,A): 10♠ -> J♠ (same suit) - Reveals A♥\n    *   (E,8,B): A♠ -> 2♠ (same suit) - Reveals 5♠\n    *   (F,7,E): 4♣ -> 5♠ (wrong suit) - Reveals 10♣\n    *   (G,6,C): 9♠ -> 10♠ (same suit) - Reveals Q♠\n    *   (H,7,F): 6♠ -> 7♠ (same suit) - Reveals J♦\n    *   (I,8,G): Q♦ -> K♦ (same suit) - Reveals 8♥\n    *   (J,7,H): 3♥ -> 4♥ (same suit) - Reveals K♣\n2.  **Evaluate Best Options:** Moves that reveal hidden cards AND build same-suit sequences are generally the best.\n    *   (I,8,G): Builds Q♦-K♦, a good high-rank sequence start. Reveals 8♥.\n    *   (C,9,A): Builds J♠-10♠, another good sequence start. Reveals A♥.\n    *   (J,7,H): Builds 4♥-3♥ and reveals a K♣. Revealing Kings is strategically important as they can help clear columns later.\n    *   (E,8,B): Builds 2♠-A♠. Reveals 5♠. Positions the Ace correctly.\n3.  **Choose the Best Move:** Comparing (I,8,G), (C,9,A), and (J,7,H), revealing the King (K♣) with move (J,7,H) offers a slight strategic advantage for potentially clearing column J later, even though the other moves build slightly higher-ranked sequences initially. Building the 4♥-3♥ sequence is also positive.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning: The goal is to build sequences and uncover hidden cards. Moving the 5♠ A♠ run from column E onto the 6♠ in column H achieves both:\n1.  It builds a longer same-suit sequence (6♠ 5♠ A♠).\n2.  It uncovers the K♣ in column E, which is valuable for future moves or potentially moving to an empty column.\nOther moves like moving 6♠ to 7♠ or 4♥ to 5♥ also build sequences but don't uncover a King. Moving Q♦ to K♦ is good, but the sequence in (E,6,H) is longer.\n\nAnswer: (E,6,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify all legal moves.\n    *   (A,8,C): 9♣ on 10♠. Reveals A7(7♦).\n    *   (B,9,D): 8♦ on 9♦. Reveals B8(A♠).\n    *   (E,7,B): A♠ on 2♠. Reveals E6(5♠). Builds 2♠-A♠ sequence.\n    *   (G,6,C): 9♠ on 10♠. Reveals G5(Q♠). Builds 10♠-9♠ sequence.\n    *   (H,7,G): Q♦ on K♦. Reveals H6(J♦). Builds K♦-Q♦ sequence.\n    *   (I,7,G): Q♦ on K♦. Reveals I6(6♠). Builds K♦-Q♦ sequence.\n    *   (J,7,H): 3♥ on 4♥. Reveals J6(K♣). Builds 4♥-3♥ sequence.\n2.  Evaluate the moves based on revealing cards and building sequences. All listed moves reveal a card.\n3.  (E,7,B), (H,7,G), (I,7,G), and (J,7,H) build same-suit sequences.\n4.  Compare the sequence-building moves:\n    *   (E,7,B): Builds 2♠-A♠. Reveals 5♠. Enables possible 5♠->6♠ later.\n    *   (H,7,G): Builds K♦-Q♦. Reveals J♦. This immediately enables a follow-up move (H,6,G) to place J♦ on Q♦, building K♦-Q♦-J♦ and revealing H5(4♥).\n    *   (I,7,G): Builds K♦-Q♦. Reveals 6♠. This enables a follow-up move (I,6,F) to place 6♠ on 7♠, building 7♠-6♠ and revealing I5(8♥).\n    *   (J,7,H): Builds 4♥-3♥. Reveals K♣. Good for freeing a King, but no empty column currently exists.\n5.  Comparing (H,7,G) and (I,7,G): Both build K♦-Q♦. (H,7,G) leads to revealing J♦ which extends the *same* sequence immediately. (I,7,G) leads to revealing 6♠ which can start *another* sequence (on F). Building the longer K♦ sequence directly seems slightly preferable.\n6.  Therefore, (H,7,G) is chosen as it initiates a chain of same-suit moves (K♦-Q♦, then J♦) revealing cards along the way.\n\nAnswer: (H,7,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal Check:** The goal is to create K->A sequences. No sequences are complete, and no empty columns are available.\n2.  **Hit Check:** There are 0 hits remaining, so dealing new cards is not an option. We must find a move.\n3.  **Identify Possible Moves:** Several moves are possible that build same-suit sequences and reveal a hidden card:\n    *   (C,8,A): Moves 10♠ onto J♠. Reveals 7♣. Builds J♠-10♠.\n    *   (E,8,B): Moves A♠ onto 2♠. Reveals 5♠. Builds 2♠-A♠.\n    *   (G,6,C): Moves 9♠ onto 10♠. Reveals Q♠. Builds 10♠-9♠.\n    *   (H,7,F): Moves 6♠ onto 7♠. Reveals J♦. Builds 7♠-6♠.\n    *   (I,7,G): Moves Q♦ onto K♦. Reveals Q♥. Builds K♦-Q♦.\n    *   (J,7,H): Moves 3♥ onto 4♥. Reveals K♣. Builds 4♥-3♥.\n    *   (B,9,D): Moves 8♦ onto 9♦. Reveals A♠. Doesn't build same-suit sequence immediately.\n4.  **Evaluate Moves:**\n    *   Moves building same-suit sequences are generally preferred over those that don't, especially if they reveal a card.\n    *   Moves (C,8,A) and (G,6,C) work on the same suit (Spades). Moving (C,8,A) places 10♠ onto J♠ (Column A), revealing 7♣ (Column C). This then potentially allows moving 9♠ (Column G) onto the newly formed J♠-10♠ sequence in Column A. This sequence of moves consolidates the Spades sequence effectively and reveals two cards (7♣ and Q♠).\n    *   Moving (I,7,G) starts building a K sequence, which is valuable, but the reveal (Q♥) doesn't immediately lead to further plays.\n    *   Moving (C,8,A) seems slightly better because it sets up a potential follow-up move (G,6,A) to further consolidate the spade sequence.\n\nAnswer: (C,8,A)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Identify potential moves:** Several moves are possible: (G,6,C) 9♠→10♠, (H,5,D) 4♥→5♦, (I,6,F) 3♣→4♣, (D,5,J) 2♥→3♥.\n2.  **Evaluate moves:**\n    *   (G,6,C): Reveals Q♠, creates 10♠-9♠ sequence.\n    *   (H,5,D): Reveals J♦, doesn't create a same-suit sequence.\n    *   (I,6,F): Reveals Q♥, creates 4♣-3♣ sequence.\n    *   (D,5,J): Reveals K♣, creates 3♥-2♥ sequence.\n3.  **Choose the best move:** Creating same-suit sequences is generally good. Revealing face-down cards is crucial. Revealing high-ranking cards like Kings can be very beneficial for building sequences or potentially clearing columns later. Move (D,5,J) achieves both: it creates a same-suit pair (3♥-2♥) and reveals a King (K♣). Although the K♣ cannot move immediately, uncovering it is strategically valuable.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,J)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify possible moves.\n    - A(9♣) -> F(10♣) - exposes 7♦\n    - B(8♦) -> D(9♦) or F(9♦) - exposes A♠\n    - C(10♠) -> A(J♠) - exposes 7♣\n    - G(9♠) -> C(10♠) - exposes Q♠\n    - I(Q♦) -> G(K♦) - exposes Q♥\n    - J(3♥) -> H(4♥) - exposes K♣\n2.  Prioritize moves that:\n    - Uncover hidden cards.\n    - Build same-suit sequences.\n    - Free up Kings or create space.\n3.  Evaluate the best options:\n    - (I,5,G): Moves Q♦ to K♦. Builds a same-suit K-Q sequence, reveals Q♥. Good.\n    - (J,6,H): Moves 3♥ to 4♥. Builds a same-suit 4-3 sequence, reveals K♣. Very good, as it uncovers a King.\n4.  Compare follow-up moves:\n    - After (J,6,H), K♣ is revealed at J. We can then move Q♣ from A (A,5,J) onto this K♣. This reveals J♠ at A. This sequence of moves looks very productive.\n    - After (I,5,G), Q♥ is revealed at I. There isn't an immediate beneficial follow-up move for this Q♥.\n5.  Conclusion: Moving 3♥ from column J to column H (J,6,H) is the best move because it builds a same-suit sequence and reveals a King, enabling a subsequent beneficial move.\n\nAnswer: (J,6,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to build K->A sequences and reveal hidden cards.\n2.  There are several moves available that build same-suit runs and reveal a card:\n    *   (E,6,B): A♠ onto 2♠ -> reveals 7♣\n    *   (G,6,C): 9♠ onto 10♠ -> reveals Q♠\n    *   (H,7,F): 6♠ onto 7♠ -> reveals J♦\n    *   (I,6,G): Q♦ onto K♦ -> reveals Q♥\n    *   (J,7,B): 3♥ onto 4♥ -> reveals K♣\n3.  Moving 9♠ from G to C (onto 10♠) creates a 10♠-9♠ run. This is good because it reveals the Q♠ in column G.\n4.  Revealing the Q♠ in G immediately enables moving the J♠ from column A onto it (A,5,G), which would create a J♠-Q♠ run and reveal the Q♣ in column A. This sequence of moves progresses the spade suit build significantly.\n5.  Other moves like (I,6,G) or (J,7,B) are also good, but the (G,6,C) move seems to offer the best immediate follow-up potential for building a longer sequence.\n\nAnswer: (G,6,C)","Reasoning: The primary goals in Spider Solitaire are to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences, ultimately aiming for K->A sequences. Several moves are possible:\n1.  (A,8,F): 9♣ -> 10♣. Reveals card at A(7), builds 10♣-9♣.\n2.  (B,9,D): 8♦ -> 9♦. Reveals card at B(8), builds 9♦-8♦.\n3.  (C,8,A): 10♠-A♠ -> J♠. Reveals card at C(7), builds J♠-10♠-A♠.\n4.  (E,7,B): A♠ -> 2♠. Reveals card at E(6), builds 2♠-A♠.\n5.  (G,7,F): 6♠ -> 7♠. Reveals 9♠ at G(6), builds 7♠-6♠.\n6.  (J,7,H): 3♥ -> 4♥. Reveals card at J(6), builds 4♥-3♥.\n\nComparing these:\n- Move (C,8,A) builds the longest sequence (3 cards).\n- Move (J,7,H) builds a sequence and reveals the card at J(6), which is K♣. Revealing Kings is generally a high priority as they are the start of the target sequences and can only move to empty columns (once available).\n\nRevealing the K♣ seems strategically valuable. It doesn't immediately help build a sequence starting with K, but uncovering it is crucial for long-term progress.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. No 'hit' available.\n2.  **Empty Columns:** Column G is empty, providing flexibility.\n3.  **Available Moves:** Several moves uncover hidden cards:\n    *   (A,7,B): 7♦ → 8♦ (Uncovers A6)\n    *   (C,7,D): A♥ → 2♥ (Uncovers C6)\n    *   (E,7,B): A♠ → 2♠ (Uncovers E6)\n    *   (B,9,D): 8♦ → 9♦ (Uncovers B8)\n    *   (B,9,F): 8♦ → 9♦ (Uncovers B8)\n    *   (J,7,H): 3♥ → 4♥ (Uncovers J6)\n    *   (I,7,G): Q♦ → K♦ (Uncovers I6, uses empty column G)\n    *   (H,7,F): 6♠ → 7♠ (Uncovers H6)\n4.  **Evaluation:**\n    *   Moves uncovering cards in columns with fewer face-up cards are generally preferred (A, C, E, H, I, J).\n    *   Move (E,7,B) not only uncovers E6 but also creates a 3-card same-suit sequence (3♠, 2♠, A♠) in column B. This consolidation is valuable.\n    *   Move (I,7,G) is decent as it uncovers I6, but using the only empty column for a single card move is less ideal than other available options that don't require the empty slot.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Moving the A♠ from E to B achieves both uncovering a card in a relatively hidden column (E) and building a useful same-suit sequence.\n\nAnswer: (E,7,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards, as no more cards can be dealt ('hit' = 0).\n2.  Several moves can reveal hidden cards or enable sequences that reveal hidden cards.\n3.  Moving 3♥ (J,7) to 4♥ (H,5) is a valid move.\n4.  This move accomplishes two things:\n    *   It reveals the hidden card at J,6.\n    *   It builds a small same-suit sequence (4♥-3♥).\n5.  Other potential moves, like (I,7,F) moving 6♠ to 7♠, requires a subsequent move (Q♦ to K♦) to reveal a hidden card.\n6.  The move (J,7,H) provides immediate information by revealing J,6 and builds a sequence, making it a strong choice.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Identify potential moves:** Look for face-up cards that can move onto another card (same suit, rank-1) or onto an empty column.\n    *   A[8]: 9♣ -> 10♣ (F,6)\n    *   B[9]: 8♦ -> 9♦ (D,7)\n    *   C[8]: 10♠ -> J♠ (A,5)\n    *   E[7]: A♠ -> 2♠ (B,6)\n    *   G[7]: 6♠ -> 7♠ (F,4)\n    *   J[7]: 3♥ -> 4♥ (H,5)\n    *   (Other moves exist but involve breaking suits, which is generally less desirable unless necessary).\n2.  **Evaluate promising moves:** Prioritize moves that reveal hidden cards (especially Kings or Aces) and build same-suit sequences.\n    *   **(A, 8, F):** Move 9♣ onto 10♣. Reveals A[7]=7♦. Builds 10♣-9♣. (Good)\n    *   **(B, 9, D):** Move 8♦ onto 9♦. Reveals B[8]=A♠. Builds 9♦-8♦. (Better - reveals Ace)\n    *   **(C, 8, A):** Move 10♠ onto J♠. Reveals C[7]=A♥. Builds J♠-10♠. (Better - reveals Ace)\n    *   **(E, 7, B):** Move A♠ onto 2♠. Reveals E[6]=5♠. Builds 2♠-A♠. (Good)\n    *   **(G, 7, F):** Move 6♠ onto 7♠. Reveals G[6]=9♠. Builds 7♠-6♠. (Good)\n    *   **(J, 7, H):** Move 3♥ onto 4♥. Reveals J[6]=K♣. Builds 4♥-3♥. (Best - reveals King)\n3.  **Choose the best move:** Revealing a King is typically the most valuable outcome as Kings are essential for starting sequences and clearing columns. Move (J, 7, H) accomplishes this while also creating a small same-suit sequence (4♥-3♥).\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  Analyze the board to find all legal moves. A move consists of taking a same-suit, descending run from the bottom of one column (`FromColumn`, starting at `StartIndex`) and placing it onto the bottom card of another column (`ToColumn`) if that card is one rank higher than the start of the run.\n2.  Identify possible moves:\n    *   5♦ (D,8) can move onto 6♠ (H,7). Legal move: (D,8,H). Reveals 9♦ at D,7. (Mixed suit)\n    *   9♠ (G,6) can move onto 10♠ (C,8). Legal move: (G,6,C). Reveals Q♠ at G,5. (Same suit)\n    *   3♥ (J,7) can move onto 4♣ (F,7). Legal move: (J,7,F). Reveals K♣ at J,6. (Mixed suit)\n3.  Evaluate the moves:\n    *   (D,8,H): Reveals a card (9♦), but creates a mixed-suit sequence.\n    *   (G,6,C): Reveals a card (Q♠) and builds a same-suit sequence (10♠, 9♠ on column C). This is generally preferred as it works towards the goal of creating full K->A sequences. Revealing the Q♠ is also useful.\n    *   (J,7,F): Reveals a card (K♣), but creates a mixed-suit sequence. Revealing a King is good, but building the same-suit sequence is usually better unless a King immediately unlocks significant plays.\n4.  Conclusion: Move (G,6,C) is the best choice because it progresses a same-suit sequence and reveals a useful card (Q♠).\n\nAnswer: (G,6,C)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Identify potential moves:**\n    *   (E,6,B): A♠ onto 2♠. Reveals E[5]. Creates 2♠ A♠ sequence.\n    *   (G,6,C): 9♠ onto 10♠. Reveals G[5]. Creates 10♠ 9♠ sequence.\n    *   (I,7,D): Q♦ onto K♣. Reveals I[6]. Creates mixed K♣ Q♦ sequence.\n    *   (I,7,J): Q♦ onto K♣. Reveals I[6]. Creates mixed K♣ Q♦ sequence.\n    *   (J,7,H): 3♥ onto 4♥. Reveals J[6]. Creates 4♥ 3♥ sequence.\n2.  **Evaluate moves:**\n    *   Moves (E,6,B), (G,6,C), and (J,7,H) are generally preferred as they build same-suit sequences and reveal a hidden card.\n    *   Moves (I,7,D) and (I,7,J) create mixed-suit sequences which can be less flexible, although they also reveal a card.\n3.  **Compare best moves:**\n    *   (E,6,B) reveals E[5] (7♣). Sequence: 2♠ A♠.\n    *   (G,6,C) reveals G[5] (Q♠). Sequence: 10♠ 9♠.\n    *   (J,7,H) reveals J[6] (K♣). Sequence: 4♥ 3♥.\n4.  **Select best move:** Revealing a King (K♣) with move (J,7,H) is often strategically valuable, as Kings are needed to start full sequences or clear columns. Building the 4♥ 3♥ sequence is also positive. This seems slightly better than revealing Q♠ or 7♣.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal Check:** The primary goal is to build K->A sequences. No sequences are complete. Hits are depleted, so moves are mandatory.\n2.  **Identify Same-Suit Moves:** Look for moves where the card(s) being moved match the suit of the destination card. These are generally preferred as they help build towards complete sequences. Several such moves exist:\n    *   (A,8,F): 9♣ onto 10♣. Reveals A7=7♦.\n    *   (B,9,D) or (B,9,F): 8♦ onto 9♦. Reveals B8=A♠.\n    *   (C,8,A): 10♠ onto J♠. Reveals C7=A♥.\n    *   (E,7,B): A♠ onto 2♠. Reveals E6=5♠.\n    *   (G,6,C): 9♠ onto 10♠. Reveals G5=Q♠.\n    *   (H,7,F): 6♠ onto 7♠. Reveals H6=J♦.\n    *   (I,7,G): Q♦ onto K♦. Reveals I6=8♥.\n    *   (J,7,H): 3♥ onto 4♥. Reveals J6=K♣.\n3.  **Prioritize High-Rank Sequences & Uncovering Cards:**\n    *   Moving Q♦ onto K♦ (I,7,G) directly builds a high-ranking sequence (K♦, Q♦) in column G. This is a key step towards completing a Diamond sequence.\n    *   This move also uncovers the card at I6 (8♥), opening up further possibilities.\n    *   Other moves also uncover cards, but moving a Queen onto a King of the same suit is strategically valuable for sequence building. For example, (E,7,B) builds A♠->2♠, which is good, but lower rank. (J,7,H) reveals a K♣, but it's blocked. (H,7,F) builds 7♠->6♠.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Moving the Q♦ from column I onto the K♦ in column G is the most promising move as it progresses a potential K-A sequence with high-ranking cards and reveals a new card.\n\nAnswer: (I,7,G)","Reasoning: Creating an empty column is a high-priority strategic goal in Spider Solitaire as it provides flexibility for rearranging cards. Column G is empty. Moving the K♣ from column D (index 6) to column G achieves this, reveals the hidden card at D5, and leaves the 2♥ exposed in column D, which is helpful.\n\nAnswer: (D,6,G)","Reasoning: Moving the Q♦ from column I onto the K♦ in column G builds a same-suit sequence (K♦-Q♦), which is a primary goal. This move also uncovers the card at index 6 in column I (8♥), opening up more possibilities.\nAnswer: (I,7,G)","Reasoning: Moving the A♠ from column E onto the 2♠ in column B continues building a same-suit sequence (3♠-2♠-A♠). This is a step towards completing one of the eight required sequences. Additionally, this move reveals the hidden card at E[6], which is 5♠, potentially opening up further moves.\nAnswer: (E,7,B)","*   **Reasoning:** The primary goals are to reveal hidden cards, create empty columns, build same-suit sequences, and free up cards (especially Kings).\n    *   There is currently one empty column (G).\n    *   Several moves are possible:\n        *   Moving same-suit runs: (E,4,H) [2♣-7♣ onto 3♣, reveals E[3]], (B,5,G) [3♠-2♠ to G, reveals B[4]], (E,4,G) [2♣-7♣ to G, reveals E[3]]. Moving runs to the empty column G to reveal hidden cards (B,5,G) or (E,4,G) is a good strategy.\n        *   Moving single cards to build sequences: (H,7,F) [6♠ onto 7♠, frees J♦], (I,7,G) [Q♦ onto K♦, frees 8♥], (J,7,H) [3♥ onto 4♥, frees K♣], (E,7,B) [A♠ onto 2♠, frees 5♠].\n    *   Comparing the best options:\n        *   (E,4,G) or (B,5,G): Reveal a hidden card, utilize empty column G. Good general progress.\n        *   (J,7,H): Frees K♣ at J[6]. Building the 4♥-3♥ sequence is minor, but freeing the King is significant. A King can only be moved to an empty column, so freeing it while an empty column is available is highly advantageous. The next move can then be moving the K♣ to the empty column G.\n    *   Freeing the King with (J,7,H) offers a clear strategic advantage and a strong follow-up move, making it slightly preferable to revealing a hidden card in this instance.\n\n*   **Answer:** (J,7,H)","Reasoning: The primary goals are to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. The move (H,4,F) achieves both: it moves the 3♣ from column H onto the 4♣ at the bottom of column F, creating a 3♣-4♣ sequence. This action also reveals the hidden card at index H,3. Other moves like (E,6,H) or (G,6,C) build same-suit sequences but reveal already face-up cards. Moves like (D,5,J) reveal a hidden card but create a mixed-suit sequence, which is less ideal than building a same-suit one. Therefore, (H,4,F) offers the best combination of revealing information and organizing the board.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,F)","Okay, let's analyze the possible moves:\n\n1.  **(A,8,F):** 9♣ onto 10♣ (F6). Reveals A7. Builds 10♣-9♣ sequence.\n2.  **(B,9,D):** 8♦ onto 9♦ (D7). Reveals B8. Builds 9♦-8♦ sequence.\n3.  **(B,9,F):** 8♦ onto 9♦ (F5). Reveals B8. Builds 9♦-8♦ sequence.\n4.  **(C,8,A):** 10♠ onto J♠ (A5). Reveals C7. Builds J♠-10♠ sequence.\n5.  **(D,8,H):** 5♦ onto 6♠ (H7). Reveals D7. Off-suit move.\n6.  **(E,7,B):** A♠ onto 2♠ (B6).

Builds 4♥-3♥ sequence.\n\nAll same-suit moves reveal a hidden card and build sequences, which is generally good. We prioritize moves that uncover potentially valuable cards like Kings or Aces, or moves that help progress longer sequences or eventually clear columns.\n\n*   Move (I,7,G) places the Q♦ onto the K♦, which is a positive step towards completing a sequence. It reveals 8♥.\n*   Move (J,7,H) places 3♥ onto 4♥, revealing K♣. Uncovering a King is highly valuable as it can only be moved to an empty column (or have a Queen placed on it).\n*   Move (H,7,F) places 6♠ onto 7♠, revealing J♦. Also valuable.\n*   Moves (B,9,D) or (B,9,F) reveal A♠.\n*   Move (C,8,A) reveals A♥.\n*   Move (E,7,B) reveals A♠.\n\nComparing (I,7,G) and (J,7,H): Building onto an existing K is good, but revealing a hidden K is arguably better at this stage, as it gives more information and options for future moves, especially concerning empty columns. Therefore, (J,7,H) seems slightly preferable.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning: The most beneficial actions currently are those that uncover hidden cards, as there are no 'hit' options left and no empty columns.\n1.

Revealing hidden cards increases the chances of finding useful cards and creating further moves.\nAnswer: (D,5,J)","Reasoning: There are no more 'hit' chances remaining, so a valid move must be found. Several moves are possible. Moving the 3♥ from column J onto the 4♥ in column H creates a useful same-suit run (4♥ 3♥). Crucially, this move also exposes the K♣ at the bottom of column J. Uncovering Kings is a high priority as they can only be moved to empty columns and are the foundation of completed sequences.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning:\n1.

Move (D,5,J) also reveals a hidden card but the resulting sequence is broken. Moves (I,8,G) and (H,6,I) build sequences but don't reveal hidden cards. Therefore, (E,4,H) appears to be the strongest move.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,H)","**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze available moves:** The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences, eventually aiming for empty columns. We cannot deal new cards ('hit' chances = 0).\n2.  **Identify same-suit runs:** Look for runs that can be moved according to the rules. The run must be same-suit, and it can only move onto the bottom-most card of another column if that card is one rank higher than the start of the run.\n    *   The run `9♠` at (G,6) is a same-suit run (length 1). It can move onto a column ending in `10♠`. Column C ends in `10♠`. Move `(G,6,C)` is valid.\n    *   The run `7♦` at (A,7) is a same-suit run (length 1). It can move onto a column ending in `8♦`. Column B ends in `8♦`. Move `(A,7,B)` is valid.\n    *   The run `Q♥-8♥` at (I,5) is a same-suit run. It needs a column ending in `K♥`. None exists.

Reveals the hidden card at A,7.\n4.  **Choose the best move:** Both moves achieve the goals of revealing a card and building a same-suit sequence. Moving the `9♠` builds onto a `10♠`, which is slightly higher rank than moving `7♦` onto `8♦`. Both columns G and A have 4 hidden cards. Let's prioritize the move that builds the higher-ranked sequence.\n\n**Answer:** (G,6,C)","Reasoning: Moving the 3♥ from column J onto the 4♥ in column H reveals the hidden card underneath (K♣). Revealing Kings is crucial for organizing Queens and potentially completing sequences or freeing up columns. This move directly uncovers a King with minimal disruption.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Build same-suit sequences K->A. With no hits left, making progress towards sequences or uncovering useful cards is crucial.\n2.  **Evaluate Moves:**\n    *   **(D,5,J):** Move 2♥ onto 3♥ (J). Exposes K♣ (D). Okay, but doesn't build a same-suit sequence.\n    *   **(H,5,B):** Move 4♥ onto 5♥ (B). Exposes 3♣ (H). Builds a short 5♥-4♥ sequence.\n    *   **(G,6,C):** Move the 9♠-6♠ run from G onto 10♠ (C).

Move (G,6,C) builds a sequence on 10♠, potentially closer to completion, and consolidates three Spades. Move (J,4,I) consolidates three Hearts but exposes a King, which is often less helpful unless it empties a column or builds onto another King immediately. Move (G,6,C) seems slightly more advantageous for consolidating the Spade suit.\n\nAnswer: (G,6,C)","Reasoning: The goal is to create same-suit sequences and reveal hidden cards.\n1. Identify potential moves:\n    - 5♥ (B,7) can move to 6♠ (H,7). Reveals A♠ (B,8).\n    - 5♦ (D,8) can move to 6♠ (H,7). Reveals 9♦ (D,7).\n    - 5♠ (E,6) can move to 6♠ (H,7). Reveals 7♣ (E,5).\n2. Evaluate moves:\n    - Moving 5♠ onto 6♠ (E,6,H) continues a same-suit sequence (Spades) on column H, which is highly desirable. It also reveals a card (7♣) in column E.\n    - The other moves (B,7,H) and (D,8,H) place cards of different suits onto the 6♠, potentially blocking future same-suit sequences on column H.\n3. Conclusion: Moving the 5♠ from column E to column H is the best move as it builds a same-suit sequence and reveals a card.\n\nAnswer: (E,6,H)","Reasoning: Several moves are possible that consolidate same-suit runs and reveal a hidden card underneath.\n- (B,9,D): 8♦ -> 9♦ reveals A♠.\n- (C,8,A): 10♠ -> J♠ reveals A♥.\n- (E,7,B): A♠ -> 2♠ reveals 5♠.\n- (H,7,F): 6♠ -> 7♠ reveals J♦.\n- (J,7,H): 3♥ -> 4♥ reveals K♣.\n\nAmong these, revealing the K♣ via move (J,7,H) is highly advantageous. The revealed K♣ (at J,6) can then be immediately moved onto the Q♣ (at A,6) in the next step, starting the formation of a K→A sequence with K♣-Q♣. Prioritizing moves that reveal Kings and allow them to be placed correctly is a key strategy.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  Analyze available moves: Identify all possible moves of face-up cards\/sequences onto valid target cards.\n2.  Prioritize moves: Prefer moves that build same-suit sequences (especially starting from Ace), reveal hidden cards, or create empty columns (though none are possible immediately).\n3.  Evaluate top candidates:\n    *   (E,7,B): Move A♠ from column E (index 7) onto 2♠ in column B (index 6). This builds a 3-card same-suit sequence (3♠, 2♠, A♠) and reveals the card at E,6 (5♠). This is excellent as it progresses towards a K->A sequence and uncovers a card.\n    *   (B,9,D) or (B,9,F): Move 8♦ onto 9♦. Reveals A♠ at B,8. Revealing an Ace is good, but the A♠ cannot currently move anywhere useful.\n    *   (C,8,A): Move 10♠ onto J♠. Reveals A♥ at C,7. This is good as the revealed A♥ could then move onto 2♥ (D,5) in the next step.\n    *   Other moves like (A,8,F), (F,7,D), (G,6,F), (H,7,F), (I,7,G), (J,7,H) reveal cards but don't build significant sequences immediately.\n4.  Conclusion: Move (E,7,B) offers the best immediate benefit by creating a valuable A-2-3 same-suit sequence while also revealing a card.\n\nAnswer: (E,7,B)","Okay, let's analyze the board for the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Goal:** Build K->A sequences. We have 0\/8 completed.\n2.  **Deck:** 0 cards left, so 'hit' is not possible.\n3.  **Empty Columns:** None.\n4.  **Revealing Cards:** Moves that uncover face-down cards (XX) are generally good. However, all bottom cards are face-up, so any move that moves the *entire* stack below a hidden card will reveal one. This only happens if we move the last card(s) of a column.\n5.  **Building Sequences:** Moves that create or extend same-suit descending runs are prioritized.\n6.  **Unblocking:** Moves that free up cards needed for other sequences are good.\n\n**Possible Same-Suit Moves:**\n*   (J,7,H): Move 3♥ (J, index 7) onto 4♥ (H, index 5). Reveals K♣ in J. Creates 4♥-3♥ sequence.\n*   (B,9,D): Move 8♦ (B, index 9) onto 9♦ (D, index 7). Reveals A♠ in B. Creates 9♦-8♦ sequence.\n*   (C,8,A): Move 10♠ (C, index 8) onto J♠ (A, index 5). Reveals A♥ in C. Creates J♠-10♠ sequence.\n*   (E,7,B): Move A♠ (E, index 7) onto 2♠ (B, index 6). Reveals K♣ in E. Creates 2♠-A♠ sequence.\n*   (A,8,F): Move 9♣ (A, index 8) onto 10♣ (F, index 6). Reveals 7♦ in A. Creates 10♣-9♣ sequence.\n*   (G,6,C): Move 9♠ (G, index 6) onto 10♠ (C, index 8). Reveals Q♠ in G. Creates 10♠-9♠ sequence.\n*   (I,7,G): Move Q♦ (I, index 7) onto K♦ (G, index 4). Reveals 8♥ in I. Creates K♦-Q♦ sequence.\n\n**Evaluation:**\nAll the listed same-suit moves reveal a card and build sequences. Let's weigh them:\n*   Moves revealing Kings or Aces are high value: (J,7,H) reveals K♣, (B,9,D) reveals A♠, (C,8,A) reveals A♥, (E,7,B) reveals K♣.\n*   Moves building sequences starting from K are high value: (I,7,G) creates K♦-Q♦.\n*   (I,7,G) builds directly onto an existing King (K♦), advancing that specific sequence towards completion. It reveals an 8♥.\n*   (E,7,B) creates the end of a sequence (2♠-A♠) and reveals a K♣. Revealing a King is very useful.\n*   (C,8,A) creates J♠-10♠ and reveals an A♥. Revealing an Ace is useful for finishing sequences.\n\nComparing (I,7,G) and (E,7,B): Building the K♦-Q♦ sequence seems slightly more productive towards clearing a full sequence than creating 2♠-A♠ and revealing a K♣ that might not be immediately useful.\n\nTherefore, moving the Q♦ onto the K♦ is the most promising move.\n\nAnswer: (I,7,G)","Reasoning: Moving the A♠ from column E onto the 2♠ in column B creates the longest possible same-suit sequence (3♠, 2♠, A♠) among the available moves. This action also reveals a hidden card in column E, which could enable further plays.\n\nAnswer: (E,8,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify all legal moves:\n    *   (F, 7, D): Move 4♣ (F[7]) onto 5♦ (D[8]). Exposes 10♣ (F[6]). Mixes suits.\n    *   (G, 6, C): Move 9♠ (G[6]) onto 10♠ (C[8]). Exposes Q♠ (G[5]). Builds a same-suit sequence (10♠ 9♠).\n    *   (J, 7, F): Move 3♥ (J[7]) onto 4♣ (F[7]). Exposes K♣ (J[6]). Mixes suits.\n2.  Evaluate the moves:\n    *   Building same-suit sequences is a primary goal. Move (G, 6, C) achieves this by creating a 10♠ 9♠ run.\n    *   Exposing hidden cards is important. All moves expose a card. (G, 6, C) exposes Q♠, (F, 7, D) exposes 10♣, and (J, 7, F) exposes K♣. Exposing the Q♠ or K♣ is generally better than exposing the 10♣.\n    *   Moves that maintain or create same-suit runs are preferred over mixed-suit moves unless the mixed-suit move offers a significant advantage (like opening a column or revealing a critical card).\n3.  Compare the best options:\n    *   (G, 6, C) builds a same-suit sequence and reveals a potentially useful Queen.\n    *   (J, 7, F) reveals a King, which is good, but mixes suits and the King cannot currently move.\n    *   (F, 7, D) mixes suits and reveals a less critical card (10♣).\n4.  Conclusion: Move (G, 6, C) is the best as it makes progress on a same-suit sequence (Spades) while also revealing a useful card (Q♠).\n\nAnswer: (G,6,C)","Reasoning: The best moves generally aim to reveal hidden cards, create empty columns, or build same-suit sequences (especially K->A). Currently, there are no empty columns and no moves that reveal hidden cards directly. Several moves build same-suit sequences and reveal face-up cards. Among these:\n- (J,6,H): Moves 3♥ onto 4♥. This reveals K♣ in column J and builds 4♥-3♥. Revealing a King is highly valuable as it's needed for sequence completion and allows moving Queens.\n- (I,5,G): Moves Q♦ onto K♦. This reveals Q♥ in column I and builds K♦-Q♦. Also good, building on a King.\n- (G,5,C): Moves 9♠ onto 10♠. Reveals Q♠ in G and builds 10♠-9♠. Good for spade consolidation.\n- (B,6,C): Moves 2♠-A♠ onto 3♠. Reveals 3♠ in B and builds 3♠-2♠-A♠. Creates the longest sequence immediately.\n\nComparing these, revealing the K♣ with (J,6,H) provides key information and a future placement spot for Q♣, making it a strategically strong move.\n\nAnswer: (J,6,H)","Reasoning: The goal is to uncover hidden cards and build sequences. Moving the 9♠ from column G onto the 10♠ in column C achieves two things:\n1. It builds a same-suit sequence (10♠-9♠).\n2. It reveals the card underneath the 9♠ in column G (which is Q♠).\nRevealing the Q♠ is particularly useful because there is a J♠ at the bottom of column A which can then be moved onto the Q♠, revealing another hidden card in column A and building a longer sequence. Other moves, like (E,6,H) or (H,6,I), also reveal cards but don't immediately set up such a favourable follow-up move.\n\nAnswer: (G,6,C)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to expose hidden cards ('XX') to reveal potential sequences or enable further moves.\n2.  Moves that expose cards under Kings are particularly valuable as Kings can only move to empty columns, which are currently unavailable.\n3.  Moving the 3♥ from column J (index 7) onto the 4♥ in column H (index 5) is a legal move: (J,7,H).\n4.  This move exposes the K♣ at index 6 in column J.\n5.  Crucially, the card above this K♣ (at index 5) is a hidden card ('XX'). Exposing hidden cards is the most productive action when no sequences can be completed or empty columns created.\n6.  Other moves consolidate suits or expose cards, but exposing a hidden card, especially under a King, takes precedence. For example, (I,8,G) exposes 8♥, (H,7,F) exposes J♦, (B,9,D) exposes A♠, etc., but none guarantee revealing an 'XX' card like (J,7,H) does.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Identify Potential Moves:** Scan the bottom card of each column and look for valid moves (descending sequence, same suit, onto a card one rank higher or an empty column).\n    *   A♠ (E,8) can move to 2♠ (B,6). Reveals E7 (A♠).\n    *   6♠ (G,7) can move to 7♠ (F,5). Reveals G6 (9♠).\n    *   9♠-6♠ (G,6) can move to 10♠ (C,8). Reveals G5 (Q♠).\n    *   Q♦ (H,7) can move to K♦ (G,4). Reveals H6 (J♦).\n    *   Q♦ (I,7) can move to K♦ (G,4). Reveals I6 (8♥).\n    *   3♥ (J,7) can move to 4♥ (H,5). Reveals J6 (K♣).\n2.  **Evaluate Moves:**\n    *   Moving A♠ (E,8,B) reveals another A♠, which isn't immediately helpful.\n    *   Moving 6♠ (G,7,F) reveals 9♠. This enables moving 9♠-6♠ to 10♠ (C,8).\n    *   Moving 9♠-6♠ (G,6,C) directly creates a longer spade sequence (10♠-9♠-6♠) and reveals Q♠ (G,5). This is generally a good strategy - consolidating same-suit sequences.\n    *   Moving Q♦ (H,7,G) or (I,7,G) builds a K♦-Q♦ sequence and reveals J♦ or 8♥ respectively. This is also good, building towards a K->A sequence.\n    *   Moving 3♥ (J,7,H) builds a 4♥-3♥ sequence and reveals K♣. Revealing a King is often good, but K♣ doesn't immediately help build sequences here.\n3.  **Choose Best Move:** Moving the 9♠-6♠ sequence from G to C (G,6,C) seems the most advantageous. It builds a longer same-suit sequence (10♠-9♠-6♠), which is a primary goal, and reveals the Q♠ underneath, potentially enabling further moves later. While moving a Q♦ to the K♦ is also productive, consolidating the existing spade sequence is slightly better.\n\nAnswer: (G,6,C)","Okay, let's analyze the board.\nThe goal is to uncover hidden cards, create empty columns, and build same-suit sequences (K->A). We have no more 'hit' chances available.\n\n1.  **Reveal Hidden Cards:**\n    *   Moving 3♠ from B (index 5) to 4♥ on H reveals the card at B[4]. Move: (B,5,H).\n    *   Moving 2♣ from E (index 5) to 3♣ on H reveals the card at E[4]. Move: (E,5,H).\n    Both moves reveal a hidden card. Moving 2♣ onto 3♣ (E,5,H) seems slightly preferable as it places the 2♣ onto a card of the same suit (3♣), potentially aiding future sequence building.\n\n2.  **Build Same-Suit Sequences:**\n    *   Moving 8♥ from J (index 5) to 9♥ on I creates a 9♥-8♥ sequence and reveals J[4]. Move: (J,5,I).\n    *   Moving 3♥ from J (index 8) to 4♥ on H creates a 4♥-3♥ sequence and reveals J[7]. Move: (J,8,H).\n    *   Moving 3♣ from H (index 5) to 4♣ on F creates a 10♣-4♣-3♣ sequence (mixed suit) and reveals H[4]. Move: (H,5,F).\n\n3.  **Other Moves:**\n    *   Moving Q♣ from A (index 6) to K♣ on D or J reveals A[5].\n    *   Moving 10♠ from C (index 8) to J♠ on A reveals C[7].\n    *   Moving Q♠ from G (index 6) to K♣ on D or J reveals G[5].\n    *   Moving Q♥ from I (index 6) to K♣ on D or J reveals I[5].\n    *   Moving Q♦ from I (index 8) to K♦ on G or K♣ on D\/J reveals I[7].\n\n**Decision:**\nRevealing hidden cards is generally the best strategy when other options aren't immediately obvious. Between (B,5,H) and (E,5,H), the move (E,5,H) places 2♣ onto 3♣, which is slightly better for potential future consolidation than placing 3♠ onto 4♥.\n\nAnswer: (E,5,H)","Reasoning: The best move should ideally build same-suit sequences or uncover hidden cards. Uncovering Kings is particularly valuable. Let's evaluate the options:\n1.  Moving 8♦ from C (index 9) to 9♦ in D (index 7) or F (index 5) builds a diamond sequence and uncovers 10♠ in column C. This is a good move.\n2.  Moving 3♥ from J (index 7) to 4♥ in H (index 5) builds a heart sequence and uncovers K♣ in column J. This is also a good move.\n\nComparing these, uncovering a King (K♣) is generally more strategically important than uncovering a 10♠, as Kings can only move to empty columns and revealing them helps plan for that. Therefore, moving the 3♥ is the slightly better option.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","This move creates a three-card same-suit sequence (3♠-2♠-A♠) in column B, which is generally a good strategy for consolidating suits and working towards completing sequences. It also uncovers the card at E[7].\n\nAnswer: (E,8,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Uncover hidden cards and build same-suit descending runs. There are no 'hit' chances left.\n2.  **Identify Same-Suit Moves:**\n    *   (B, 5, C): Move 2♠ onto 3♠. Uncovers A♠. Creates 3♠-2♠ run.\n    *   (E, 7, H): Move 5♠ onto 6♠. Uncovers 7♣. Creates 6♠-5♠ run.\n    *   (J, 9, H): Move 3♥ onto 4♥. Uncovers K♣. Creates 4♥-3♥ run.\n3.  **Identify Other Revealing Moves:**\n    *   (H, 7, I): Move J♦ onto Q♦. Uncovers 4♥.\n    *   (I, 9, G): Move Q♦ onto K♦. Uncovers Q♥.\n4.  **Evaluate Options:**\n    *   Moves that create same-suit runs *and* uncover cards are generally preferred. (B,5,C), (E,7,H), and (J,9,H) fit this.\n    *   Comparing the three:\n        *   (B,5,C) uncovers A♠.\n        *   (E,7,H) uncovers 7♣. The created 6♠-5♠ run can immediately move onto 7♠ in column F.\n        *   (J,9,H) uncovers K♣. Less immediately useful as there are no empty columns or available Q♣.\n    *   The move (E, 7, H) seems best because it uncovers a card (7♣) and creates a 6♠-5♠ run that has an immediate follow-up move ((H, 7, F) moving 6♠-5♠ onto 7♠). This sequence builds a longer same-suit run and uncovers another card in the next step.\n\nAnswer: (E,7,H)","Reasoning: The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build sequences. There are several possible moves:\n1.  (A, 8, F): Move 9♣ onto 10♣. Reveals A7 (7♦). Builds 10♣-9♣.\n2.  (B, 9, D): Move 8♦ onto 9♦. Reveals B8 (A♠). Builds 9♦-8♦.\n3.  (E, 8, B): Move A♠ onto 2♠. Reveals E7 (A♠). Builds 2♠-A♠.\n4.  (J, 7, H): Move 3♥ onto 4♥. Reveals J6 (K♣). Builds 4♥-3♥.\n\nMoves (B,9,D) and (E,8,B) both reveal an Ace, which is good. Move (E,8,B) immediately builds a sequence (2♠-A♠) using the moved card. Move (B,9,D) also builds a sequence (9♦-8♦). Revealing an Ace seems slightly more promising than revealing a 7♦ or a K♣ (which is under a Q♥). Between the two Ace-revealing moves, (E,8,B) seems slightly better as it builds the sequence involving the Ace right away.\n\nAnswer: (E,8,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  **Available Moves:** Several moves are possible that reveal a hidden card.\n    *   (C,8,A): 10♠ onto J♠ (Reveals C)\n    *   (D,8,H): 5♦ onto 6♠ (Reveals D)\n    *   (E,8,B): A♠ onto 2♠ (Reveals E, builds ♠ run)\n    *   (F,7,E): 4♣ onto 5♠ (Reveals F)\n    *   (G,6,C): 9♠ onto 10♠ (Reveals G, builds ♠ run)\n    *   (H,7,F): 6♠ onto 7♠ (Reveals H, builds ♠ run)\n    *   (I,7,G): Q♦ onto K♦ (Reveals I, builds ♦ run starting with K)\n    *   (J,7,H): 3♥ onto 4♥ (Reveals J, builds ♥ run)\n3.  **Best Move Selection:** Moves that build same-suit runs are generally better. Among those, moving Q♦ onto K♦ (I,7,G) is particularly attractive because it starts building a sequence from the King (K♦ Q♦), which is essential for clearing sequences. It also reveals a card in column I.\n\nAnswer: (I,7,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to build same-suit K->A sequences and uncover hidden cards.\n2.

Revealing hidden cards is crucial.\n3.  Other potential moves involve placing Queens on Kings or moving single cards between different suits. While these moves reveal cards, they don't immediately build same-suit runs like (A,5,G) does. Building the Q♠-J♠ sequence seems strategically sound.\n4.  There are no 'hit' chances remaining.\n\nAnswer: (A,5,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences towards K->A.\n2.  **No Hits Left:** We must work with the cards currently on the board.

Builds sequence, uncovers K♣.\n4.  **Compare good moves:** Moves (A,8,F), (C,6,D), (E,7,B), (G,6,C), (H,8,F), (J,8,H) all build same-suit sequences and uncover cards.\n5.  **Prioritize:**\n    *   Uncovering Kings is generally good: (E,7,B) uncovers K♣, (G,6,C) uncovers K♦, (J,8,H) uncovers K♣.\n    *   Move (G,6,C) is particularly good because it uncovers K♦, and there is a Q♦ visible in column I that can potentially move onto it immediately after, uncovering another card (8♥ in I).\n    *   Move (E,7,B) uncovers K♣, but moving the Q♣ from A onto it would reveal nothing.\n    *   Move (J,8,H) uncovers K♣, similar situation.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Move (G,6,C) offers the best immediate potential by building a sequence, uncovering a King, and enabling a follow-up move that builds another sequence and uncovers another card.\n\nAnswer: (G,6,C)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Find the best move to progress towards building K->A sequences.\n2.  **Priorities:** Create same-suit sequences, uncover hidden cards, utilize empty columns strategically.\n3.  **Available Moves:**\n    *   (A,8,F): 9♣ onto 10♣. Uncovers A(7). Creates 10♣-9♣.\n    *   (B,8,C): A♠ onto 2♠. Uncovers B(7). Creates 2♠-A♠.\n    *   (D,8,H): 5♦ onto 6♠. Uncovers D(7). Mixes suits.\n    *   (F,7,E): 4♣ onto 5♠. Uncovers F(6). Mixes suits.\n    *   (J,7,H): 3♥ onto 4♥. Uncovers J(6). Creates 4♥-3♥.\n    *   Moves to Empty Column G: Several options, each uncovering one card.\n4.  **Comparison:**\n    *   Moves (A,8,F), (B,8,C), and (J,7,H) all create 2-card same-suit sequences and uncover a hidden card, which is highly desirable.\n    *   (B,8,C) moves an Ace onto a 2 of the same suit, forming the end of a potential sequence (2♠-A♠). This is often a good move. It uncovers 5♥ in column B.\n    *   (A,8,F) moves 9♣ onto 10♣, forming 10♣-9♣ and uncovering 7♦ in column A. Also a good move.\n    *   (J,7,H) moves 3♥ onto 4♥, forming 4♥-3♥ and uncovering K♣ in column J. Revealing a King can sometimes block a column, but it's also necessary progress.\n    *   Moving to the empty column G first doesn't seem immediately better than making one of the sequence-building moves.\n5.  **Decision:** Moving A♠ to 2♠ (B,8,C) creates a valuable same-suit sequence end (2♠-A♠) and reveals a new card (5♥). This seems like a strong choice.\n\nAnswer: (B,8,C)","Okay, let's analyze the possible moves:\n\n1.  **(A,8,F)**: Move 9♣ onto 10♣. Reveals A[7] (7♦). Builds 10♣-9♣.\n2.  **(B,8,C)**: Move A♠ onto 2♠. Reveals B[7] (5♥). Builds 2♠-A♠.\n3.  **(B,9,F)**: Move 8♦ onto 9♦. Reveals B[8] (A♠). Builds 9♦-8♦.\n4.  **(C,7,D)**: Move A♥ onto 2♥. Reveals C[6] (7♣). Builds 2♥-A♥.\n5.  **(E,4,H)**: Move 2♣ onto 3♣. Reveals E[3] (XX). Builds 3♣-2♣.\n6.  **(F,6,G)**: Move K♣ (and 4♣) onto the empty column G. Reveals F[5] (9♦). Frees up the King stack.\n7.  **(I,7,F)**: Move 6♠ onto 7♠. Reveals I[6] (J♦). Builds 7♠-6♠.\n8.  **(J,6,I)**: Move 8♥-3♥ onto 9♥. Reveals J[5] (Q♥). Builds 9♥-8♥-3♥ (though 3♥ is out of place).\n9.  **(J,7,H)**: Move 3♥ onto 4♥. Reveals J[6] (8♥). Builds 4♥-3♥.\n\nAll these moves are legal and reveal a card. The primary goal at this stage is usually to reveal hidden cards ('XX'). Move (E,4,H) is the only option that reveals a face-down card (at E[3]). Gaining new information is typically the highest priority.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,H)","Reasoning: The only possible move is moving the 3♥ from column J (index 7) onto the 4♥ at the bottom of column H (index 5). This move allows progress by revealing the card underneath the 3♥ in column J. There are no other available moves, and no more cards can be dealt ('hit').\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning: Moving the A♥ from column C onto the 2♥ in column D reveals the hidden card below A♥, which is K♣. Exposing Kings is generally a high priority as it opens up possibilities for building full sequences or clearing columns later. This move also creates a small sequence (2♥-A♥) in column D.\n\nAnswer: (C,7,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal Assessment:** The primary goal is to build K->A sequences and uncover hidden cards. We have 0 hits left and 25 turns remaining.\n2.  **Identify Potential Moves:** Several moves are possible:\n    *   (A,8,F): 9♣ -> 10♣ (Frees 7♦ in A)\n    *   (B,9,D) or (B,9,F): 8♦ -> 9♦ (Frees A♠ in B)\n    *   (C,8,A): 10♠ -> J♠ (Builds J♠-10♠, frees 7♣ in C, reveals XX in A)\n    *   (E,8,B): A♠ -> 2♠ (Builds 2♠-A♠, frees K♣ in E)\n    *   (G,6,C): 9♠ -> 10♠ (Builds 10♠-9♠, frees Q♠ in G)\n    *   (I,7,G): Q♦ -> K♦ (Builds K♦-Q♦, frees 8♥ in I)\n    *   (J,7,H): 3♥ -> 4♥ (Builds 4♥-3♥, frees K♣ in J)\n3.  **Evaluate Best Move:**\n    *   Moves that uncover hidden cards are generally preferred. Move (C,8,A) achieves this by moving 10♠ from C onto J♠ in A, revealing the card at A[4].\n    *   This move also builds a same-suit sequence (J♠-10♠), which is beneficial.\n    *   Other strong moves like (E,8,B) or (J,7,H) free Kings, and (I,7,G) builds on an existing King, but none of them reveal a hidden card. Revealing hidden cards is crucial with limited turns and no hits left.\n\nTherefore, moving the 10♠ from C to A is the most strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: (C,8,A)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards to find potential sequences and enable more moves. Revealing cards from columns with more hidden cards is generally better.\n2.  **Evaluate Reveals:**\n    *   Moving J♠ from column A (index 5) to Q♠ in column G (index 5) is a valid move: (A,5,G). This move will reveal the hidden card at A,4. Column A has 5 hidden cards, making this reveal valuable.\n    *   Moving 2♣ from column E (index 4) to 3♣ in column H (index 4) is a valid move: (E,4,H). This move will reveal the hidden card at E,3. Column E has 4 hidden cards.\n    *   Comparing (A,5,G) and (E,4,H), revealing a card in column A is slightly preferred as it has more hidden cards (5 vs 4).\n3.  **Evaluate Sequence Building:** Several moves build same-suit sequences (e.g., moving A♥ to 2♥, 3♥ to 4♥, 5♥ to 6♥, 6♠ to 7♠, 9♠ to 10♠). The most promising is building the Heart sequence, starting with (C,7,D), which leads to a chain of moves revealing known cards (9♦, A♠, J♦). However, revealing unknown cards takes precedence when no immediate sequence completion is possible and the sequence building only reveals already visible cards or cards low in their columns.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The move (A,5,G) directly addresses the primary goal of revealing unknown cards in the column with the most hidden cards (A), making it the best strategic choice at this point.\n\nAnswer: (A,5,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify possible moves involving same-suit runs or exposing useful cards.\n2.  **(H, 7, F):** Move 6♠ onto 7♠. Creates 7♠-6♠ run. Exposes J♦. Good.\n3.  **(I, 7, G):** Move Q♦ onto K♦. Creates K♦-Q♦ run. Exposes 8♥. Very good, builds on a King.\n4.  **(J, 7, H):** Move 3♥ onto 4♥. Creates 4♥-3♥ run. Exposes Q♦. Good.\n5.  Consider the follow-up to (J, 7, H): The exposed Q♦ (J6) can move to K♦ (G4) via `(J, 6, G)`. This creates K♦-Q♦ and exposes K♣ (J6). Exposing a King is highly valuable.\n6.  Consider the follow-up to (H, 7, F): The exposed J♦ (H8) can move to Q♦ (I7) via `(H, 8, I)`. This creates Q♦-J♦ and exposes 6♠ (H7). Good, but exposing K♣ is better than exposing 6♠.\n7.  Consider the follow-up to (I, 7, G): The exposed 8♥ (I6) could move to 9♦ (D7) or 9♠ (G6), breaking suits. Less ideal immediately.\n\nComparing the options, the sequence starting with (J, 7, H) seems best because it leads to creating a same-suit run (4♥-3♥), building on a King (K♦-Q♦), and exposing another King (K♣).\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. No more 'hit' available.\n2.  **Analyze Moves:** Several same-suit moves are possible:\n    *   (A, 5, G): J♠ onto Q♠. Uncovers Q♣. Creates Q♠-J♠.\n    *   (B, 6, C): 2♠ onto 3♠. Uncovers 3♠. Creates 3♠-2♠.\n    *   (E, 6, H): 5♠ onto 6♠. Uncovers 7♣. Creates 6♠-5♠.\n    *   (G, 6, C): 9♠ onto 10♠. Uncovers Q♠. Creates 10♠-9♠.\n3.  **Compare Best Moves:**\n    *   Moves (A, 5, G), (E, 6, H), and (G, 6, C) all build same-suit sequences and uncover a hidden card.\n    *   (G, 6, C) uncovers Q♠ in column G. This is valuable because the J♠ in column A can then be moved onto it, uncovering another card (Q♣ in A). This sequence of moves (G,6,C followed by A,5,G) reveals two cards and builds two sequences.\n    *   (A, 5, G) uncovers Q♣ in column A. The J♠ moves onto Q♠ in G. Subsequently, 9♠ (now in G) could move to 10♠ (C). This sequence also reveals two cards and builds two sequences.\n    *   (E, 6, H) uncovers 7♣, which is less immediately useful than uncovering a Queen.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Both (G, 6, C) and (A, 5, G) lead to good follow-up moves revealing two cards. Choosing (G, 6, C) first builds the 10♠-9♠ sequence and reveals the Q♠ needed for the J♠.\n\nAnswer: (G,6,C)","Reasoning: There are several possible moves. Moving 3♥ from J onto 4♥ in H (J,7,H) reveals a hidden card (K♣) and builds a small sequence (4♥-3♥). Revealing a King is often a good strategic move as it can eventually hold a full sequence or allow columns to be emptied. Other moves like (G,6,C) or (I,7,G) also build sequences and reveal cards, but revealing a King feels slightly more impactful at this stage, especially with no more 'hit' chances available.\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning: The priority is to reveal hidden cards, as there are no more 'hit' chances available. Several moves reveal hidden cards. Moving A♠ from column E to 2♠ in column B (E,8,B) reveals the card at E,7 (K♣). Revealing a King is strategically valuable. This move also creates a small same-suit sequence (2♠-A♠) in column B. Other good options exist, like (J,7,H) which also reveals a King (K♣), or (C,8,A) which reveals an Ace (A♥) and builds J♠-10♠, but revealing a King while also building a same-suit sequence seems slightly stronger.\n\nAnswer: (E,8,B)","This move reveals a hidden card and builds a same-suit sequence.\n\n1.  Moving J♠ from column A onto Q♠ in column G reveals the hidden card at A4.\n2.  This move also creates a Q♠-J♠ sequence within column G, furthering the goal of building sequences.\n3.  Other moves like (E,6,H) or (J,7,H) only reveal already visible cards, making them less advantageous than revealing a hidden card.\n\nAnswer: (A,5,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to build sequences and uncover hidden cards. No 'hit' is available.\n2.  Moving 6♠ from column H onto 7♠ in column F (H,7,F) creates a same-suit run (7♠-6♠).\n3.  This move uncovers J♦ in column H.\n4.  The uncovered J♦ can then be moved onto Q♠ (G) or Q♥ (I or J), which will uncover the next card in column H (4♥).\n5.  This sequence of moves uncovers two cards and builds a same-suit run, which is generally a good strategy. Other moves like (G,6,C) or (C,8,A) also uncover cards but (H,7,F) builds a valuable same-suit pair.\n\nAnswer: (H,7,F)","Reasoning: Several moves are available that reveal hidden cards.\n1. (J,7,H): Moves 3♥ onto 4♥, revealing K♣ in column J. Revealing Kings is generally high priority.\n2. (I,8,G): Moves Q♦ onto K♦, revealing 6♠ in column I. This builds a valuable K-Q sequence.\n3. (G,6,C): Moves 9♠ onto 10♠, revealing Q♠ in column G. Builds a 10-9 sequence.\n4. (H,7,F): Moves 6♠ onto 7♠, revealing J♦ in column H. Builds a 7-6 sequence.\n5. (C,8,A): Moves 10♠ onto J♠, revealing A♥ in column C. Builds a J-10 sequence.\n6. (B,9,D): Moves 8♦ onto 9♦, revealing A♠ in column B. Builds a 9-8 sequence.\n7. (A,8,F): Moves 9♣ onto 10♣, revealing A♠ in column A. Builds a 10-9 sequence.\n\nComparing (J,7,H) and (I,8,G): Revealing a King is good, but building the K♦-Q♦ sequence seems more immediately productive as it organizes high cards towards completion and still reveals a card.\n\nAnswer: (I,8,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Identify possible moves:** Several moves are possible: (B,9,D), (C,8,A), (E,7,B), (I,7,G), (J,7,B).\n2.  **Evaluate moves based on revealing cards and building sequences:**\n    *   (B,9,D) moves 8♦ onto 9♦, reveals A♠.\n    *   (C,8,A) moves 10♠ onto J♠, reveals A♥.\n    *   (E,7,B) moves A♠ onto 2♠, reveals 5♠.\n    *   (I,7,G) moves Q♦ onto K♦, reveals 8♥.\n    *   (J,7,B) moves 3♥ onto 4♥, reveals K♣.\n3.  **Look for follow-up moves:**\n    *   The move (E,7,B) reveals 5♠ at E(6). This 5♠ can then immediately be moved onto the 6♠ at H(7) via the move (E,6,H). This sequence reveals two cards (5♠ then 7♣) and builds two same-suit sequences (2♠-A♠ and 6♠-5♠).\n    *   Other moves like (B,9,D) also allow follow-up moves (moving the revealed A♠ onto 2♠), but the sequence starting with (E,7,B) appears slightly more advantageous as it progresses builds in two separate columns (B and H) while uncovering a card in E.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Moving the A♠ from E to B (E,7,B) is the best first step as it enables an immediate beneficial follow-up move, revealing two hidden cards in total and advancing sequence building.\n\nAnswer: (E,7,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to build same-suit sequences and uncover hidden cards.\n2.  Moving 4♥ from column H onto 5♥ in column B (H,5,B) achieves both:\n    *   It extends a same-suit sequence (5♥-4♥).\n    *   It uncovers the card at H,6 (Q♦).\n3.  The revealed Q♦ can potentially be moved onto the K♦ in column G next.\n4.  While freeing column G by moving Q♠ (G,5,D or G,5,J) is also a good strategy, building a same-suit sequence is often more directly beneficial, especially when it also reveals a potentially useful card like the Q♦.\n5.  There are no hits left.\n\nAnswer: (H,5,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal Check:** The goal is to build K->A sequences. There are no hits left, and the turn limit is approaching (86\/100).

All valid moves reveal a card.\n4.  **Compare Best Options:**\n    *   The spade suit appears frequently, making spade sequence building promising. Moves (C,8,A), (G,6,C), and (H,7,F) all contribute to this.\n    *   (C,8,A) builds J♠-10♠ and reveals 7♣.\n    *   (G,6,C) builds 10♠-9♠ and reveals Q♠.\n    *   (H,7,F) builds 7♠-6♠ and reveals J♦.\n    *   (I,7,G) builds K♦-Q♦ on an existing King, revealing 8♥. This is also a strong move.\n    *   (B,9,D) builds 9♦-8♦ and reveals A♠. Revealing an Ace is generally good.\n5.  **Select Best Move:** Comparing (C,8,A) and (G,6,C), both set up a potential J♠-10♠-9♠ sequence. (G,6,C) reveals Q♠, which is a higher-rank card than the 7♣ revealed by (C,8,A), potentially offering more strategic value sooner. Building the 10♠-9♠ sequence also keeps the J♠ available at the bottom of column A for now. Therefore, (G,6,C) seems slightly preferable.\n\nAnswer: (G,6,C)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to create K->A sequences.\n2.  There are no more 'hit' opportunities.\n3.  We need to find moves that either expose hidden cards or build towards sequences.\n4.

Moving the 2♥ from column D (index 5) onto the 3♥ in column J (index 7) is a valid same-suit move.\n4.  This move accomplishes two important things:\n    *   It continues building a sequence of hearts (3♥-2♥).\n    *   More importantly, it reveals the K♣ at index 6 in column D.\n5.  Revealing the K♣ is highly advantageous because this King can then be moved to one of the empty columns (G or H) in the subsequent turn, freeing up the 9♦ underneath it in column D and potentially allowing further moves or column clearing.\n6.  Other possible moves, like building smaller sequences (e.g., A♠ onto 2♠, 9♣ onto 10♣), do not offer the immediate strategic benefit of freeing a King that can utilize an empty column.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,J)","Reasoning:\n1.  Analyze available moves: Several single-card moves are possible: (C,8,A), (E,8,B), (G,6,C), (H,7,F), (I,8,G), (J,7,H).\n2.  Prioritize moves that reveal hidden cards and create same-suit runs. All listed moves reveal a card. Moves (E,8,B), (H,7,F), (I,8,G), and (J,7,H) build same-suit runs.\n3.  Evaluate potential follow-up moves:\n    *   (E,8,B): Moves A♠ to 2♠ (column B), uncovering 5♠ (E[7]). This 5♠ can then be moved to 6♠ (H[7]) via move (E,7,H), uncovering A♠ (E[6]). This sequence reveals two cards (5♠, A♠) and builds two same-suit runs (2♠-A♠, 6♠-5♠).\n    *   (H,7,F): Moves 6♠ to 7♠ (column F), uncovering J♦ (H[7]). This J♦ can then be moved to Q♦ (I[8]) via move (H,7,I), uncovering 4♥ (H[6]). This sequence also reveals two cards (J♦, 4♥) and builds two same-suit runs (7♠-6♠, Q♦-J♦).\n    *   (J,7,H): Moves 3♥ to 4♥ (column H), uncovering K♣ (J[6]). This reveals a valuable King but only one card.\n    *   (I,8,G): Moves Q♦ to K♦ (column G), uncovering 8♥ (I[7]). Builds K♦-Q♦. Uncovers one card.\n4.  Compare options: The sequences starting with (E,8,B) and (H,7,F) both reveal two cards over two moves while building same-suit runs. The sequence starting with (E,8,B) seems slightly preferable as it involves more Spades (potentially closer to a full sequence) and reveals an Ace, which is the bottom card needed for a sequence. Uncovering the 5♠ first allows the immediate follow-up move (E,7,H).\n\nTherefore, (E,8,B) is the best initial move.\n\nAnswer: (E,8,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal Assessment:** The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences (K->A). We are late in the game (Epoch 91\/100) with no 'hit' actions left.

(I,7,G) moves Q♦ onto K♦.\n    *   Moves that reveal Kings are also valuable as they open up spots for Queens. (J,7,H) reveals K♣.\n    *   Other moves reveal potentially useful cards or build smaller sequences.\n6.  **Choice:** Move (I,7,G) builds the K♦-Q♦ sequence, making direct progress on a potential full sequence from the highest rank. It also reveals the 8♥ in column I, potentially unlocking moves with the Q♥-9♥ above it. This seems slightly better than revealing a K♣ ((J,7,H)) which currently has no Q♣ visible to place on it, especially with few turns left.\n\nAnswer: (I,7,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The game is very close to the end (Epoch 95\/100) with no hits remaining. Priority is to uncover hidden cards or make significant progress towards completing a sequence.\n2.  Analyze available moves:\n    *   Moving single cards between columns to build sequences (suit doesn't matter for placement, only for the run being moved).\n    *   Moving same-suit runs.\n3.  Evaluate moves based on revealing hidden cards and consolidating same-suit runs.\n4.  Check moves that reveal face-down cards ('XX'):\n    *   Move J[4]=8♥ onto I[4]=9♥. This is a valid move: moving the run starting at J index 4 (just the 8♥) onto the card 9♥ in column I. This move reveals the card at J[3].\n5.  Other moves only reveal face-up cards that were previously covered or rearrange existing face-up cards.\n6.  Since revealing hidden cards is crucial for making progress, especially late in the game, moving the 8♥ from J to I is the best option.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning:\n1.  The game is near the end (Epoch 96\/100) and there are no more 'hit' chances. The priority is to reveal hidden cards or build towards sequence completion.\n2.  Consider available moves:\n    *   (A,7,B): Move 7♦ onto 8♦. Reveals 9♣ at A,8.\n    *   (D,5,J): Move 2♥ onto 3♥. Reveals K♣ at D,6.\n    *   (G,6,C): Move 9♠ onto 10♠. Builds a sequence (10♠, 9♠) but reveals no new cards as G,6 was the bottom card.\n    *   (I,6,I): Move 8♥ onto 9♥. Consolidates within the column but reveals no new cards immediately.\n3.  Comparing the moves that reveal cards: (A,7,B) reveals 9♣, and (D,5,J) reveals K♣. Revealing a King (K♣) is generally a higher priority action as it's a base card for a full sequence and might enable moves if an empty column appears. Even without an empty column now, uncovering it is valuable progress. Building the 10♠-9♠ sequence via (G,6,C) is less impactful than uncovering a hidden card at this stage.\n\nTherefore, moving 2♥ from D to J to reveal K♣ is the best action.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,J)","Reasoning:\n1.  The game is near the end (Epoch 97\/100), and there are no more 'hit' chances. The priority is to make moves that reveal hidden cards or build towards sequences.\n2.  Several moves are available that reveal a hidden card.\n3.  Moving the 3♥ from column J (index 7) onto the 4♥ in column H (index 5) achieves two goals:\n    *   It reveals the card underneath the 3♥ in column J, which is K♣ (at index 6). Revealing Kings can be helpful.\n    *   It builds a small same-suit sequence (4♥-3♥) in column H.\n4.  Other moves also reveal cards and build sequences, but revealing a King seems slightly more advantageous at this late stage than revealing other ranks like Aces or Queens available through other moves.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning: The game is at epoch 98\/100 with no hits remaining. The goal is to maximize progress in the final two turns. Several moves are possible that create a two-card same-suit sequence and reveal a hidden card. Moving the A♠ from column E onto the 2♠ in column B (move E,8,B) achieves this, revealing the card at E(7). This move is good because it progresses a spade sequence and reveals a card, potentially enabling another useful move in the final turn. For instance, if the revealed card at E(7) is 5♠, it could then be moved onto the 6♠ in column H.\n\nAnswer: (E,8,B)","This is the last turn (Epoch 99\/100) and no more cards can be dealt ('hit').

Moving the J♣ from column E to the Q♠ in column J achieves this by uncovering the card at E, index 3. While this creates a mixed-suit sequence, revealing cards takes precedence when no same-suit sequences can be immediately advanced. Moving the 7♦ from F to D is another option, but moving the Jack feels slightly better as it progresses a higher-value sequence.\nAnswer: (E,4,J)","Reasoning: There are no possible moves. The 7♠ cannot move onto the 8♣ (different suits). The J♣ in column E cannot move onto the Q♠ (different suits). The 2♣ cannot move anywhere. The 6♥ cannot move onto the 7♠ or 7♦ (different suits). The J♣ in column I cannot move onto the Q♠ (different suits). No other moves are possible with the face-up cards. All columns are occupied, so dealing new cards is the only option.\nAnswer: hit","Reasoning: The move (J,9,I) relocates the 2♦ from the bottom of column J onto the 3♦ at the bottom of column I. This move is beneficial for two main reasons:\n1.  It reveals the hidden card at index 8 in column J (which turns out to be 3♥). Exposing hidden cards is crucial for progressing in Spider Solitaire.\n2.  It creates a same-suit sequence (3♦, 2♦) in column I. Building same-suit sequences is essential for eventually clearing cards and columns.\n\nOther potential moves like (D,8,H) or (F,9,A) also uncover cards, but (J,9,I) provides the added benefit of immediately forming a same-suit pair.\n\nAnswer: (J,9,I)","**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Goal:** The primary goal is to build full K-A sequences.\n2.  **Identify King:** There is a K♥ at the bottom of column C (index 10).\n3.  **Find Queen:** There are two Q♥ cards available: one at J,5 and one at I,5.\n4.  **Evaluate Moves onto King:**\n    *   Moving Q♥ from J,5 to C,10 (J,5,C) creates a K♥-Q♥ sequence in column C. This move reveals the card K♣ at J,6.\n    *   Moving Q♥ from I,5 to C,10 (I,5,C) also creates a K♥-Q♥ sequence in column C. This move reveals the card J♦ at I,6.\n5.  **Compare Revealed Cards:** Revealing a King (K♣) is generally more valuable than revealing a Jack (J♦), as Kings are needed to start sequences and can utilize empty columns later.\n6.  **Other Moves:**\n    *   (G,6,C): Moving 9♠ onto 10♠ builds a spade sequence but doesn't utilize the existing K♥ and reveals a Q♠. Building on the King is higher priority.\n    *   Moving 3♥ (J,7) onto 4♥ (H,5 or G,7) or moving 4♥ (H,5) onto 5♥ (B,7) builds smaller heart sequences but doesn't advance the K♥ sequence or reveal a King.\n7.  **Conclusion:** Moving the Q♥ from column J to column C (J,5,C) is the best move because it builds directly onto the K♥, advancing a sequence, and reveals another King (K♣).\n\nAnswer: (J,5,C)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards and build sequences. Moving the 5♠ from column E to the 6♠ in column H accomplishes two things: it builds a small spade sequence (6♠-5♠) and, more importantly, it uncovers the hidden card at E,6, which is a King (K♣). Uncovering Kings is crucial as they are needed to start building full sequences and can clear columns if a Queen of the same suit becomes available. This particular move also has good follow-up potential, as the Q♣ at A,6 could then be moved onto the revealed K♣.\n\nAnswer: (E,6,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify all possible moves. Several moves are available involving building same-suit runs by moving a single card: (A,9,J), (B,9,F), (C,9,H), (D,9,A), (F,8,A), (G,7,B), (H,8,B), (J,8,I).\n2.  Evaluate moves based on standard Spider Solitaire heuristics: uncovering hidden cards, building same-suit sequences, creating empty columns, and enabling future moves.\n3.  The move (F,8,A) moves the 8♣ from column F (index 8) onto the 9♣ in column A (index 8). This builds a same-suit run (8♣-9♣) and exposes the 4♣ at F[7].\n4.  Exposing the 4♣ at F[7] enables a subsequent move: moving the 3♣ from H[4] onto the newly exposed 4♣ (move (H,4,F)).\n5.  Executing the move (H,4,F) would expose the face-down card at H[3]. Uncovering hidden cards is a primary objective in Spider Solitaire.\n6.  Other moves like (H,8,B) or (J,8,I) also enable good follow-up moves, but they expose known cards (A♠ or K♣ respectively) rather than leading directly to uncovering a hidden card.\n7.  Therefore, the move (F,8,A) is chosen as it initiates a sequence that reveals a hidden card.\n\nAnswer: (F,8,A)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  There are several possible moves involving same-suit runs:\n    *   (B,6,C): Move 2♠ onto 3♠ (uncovers 5♥).\n    *   (F,9,A): Move 8♣ onto 9♣ (uncovers 4♣).\n    *   (J,9,I): Move 2♦ onto 3♦ (uncovers 3♥).\n    *   (J,5,C): Move Q♥ onto K♥ (uncovers K♣).\n    *   (J,4,I): Move 8♥ onto 9♥ (uncovers Q♥).\n3.  Comparing these options, moving Q♥ onto K♥ (J,5,C) achieves two desirable outcomes: it continues building a Hearts sequence (K♥-Q♥) and, more importantly, it uncovers the K♣ in column J. Freeing up Kings is generally a high priority, even if there isn't an empty column immediately available for it. This seems more beneficial than uncovering the other cards (5♥, 4♣, 3♥, Q♥).\n4.  Dealing new cards ('hit') is not possible as there are 0 hits remaining.\n\nAnswer: (J,5,C)","Reasoning: The primary goal with no immediate sequence completions possible and no more 'hit' options is to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit runs. Several moves achieve this. Moving the A♦ from column A to the 2♦ in column J uncovers a hidden card (9♣) in column A and creates the longest possible same-suit sequence among the available moves (3♦-2♦-A♦ in column J). This consolidation of diamonds is strategically valuable.\n\nAnswer: (A,9,J)","Okay, let's analyze the board.\n\n1.  **Goal:** Reveal hidden cards, build sequences, potentially empty a column.\n2.  **Hidden Cards:** Columns C and B have the most hidden cards (10 face-down cards each initially, although C now has 10 cards total and B has 10 cards total). Revealing cards in these columns is a priority.\n3.  **Possible Moves & Evaluation:**\n    *   `(A,9,C)`: Move A♦ onto 2♣. Reveals A[8] (9♣) and C[10] (XX). This reveals a card in the deepest column (C).\n    *   `(H,8,B)`: Move 7♦ onto 8♦. Reveals H[7] (6♠) and B[10] (XX). This reveals a card in column B, which is also deep.\n    *   `(E,8,C)`: Move 9♥ onto 10♠. Reveals E[7] (A♠). C[9] is already 2♣.\n    *   `(E,8,F)`: Move 9♥ onto 10♣. Reveals E[7] (A♠).\n    *   `(G,7,B)`: Move 4♥ onto 5♥. Reveals G[6] (9♠).\n    *   Many other single-card moves exist.\n\n4.  **Comparison:** Moves (A,9,C) and (H,8,B) both reveal a card at index 10 in a deep column. Revealing the card in column C (via A,9,C) seems slightly better as column C has one more card overall currently (10 vs 9 visible) and started with more hidden cards.\n\nAnswer: (A,9,C)","Reasoning: The primary goals are to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Several moves achieve this. Moving 8♥ from column J onto 9♥ in column E builds a 9♥-8♥ sequence. This move also uncovers the hidden card at index 3 in column J. Building sequences, especially in suits like hearts where the K♥ and Q♥ are already visible, increases the chances of clearing columns or creating full sequences later.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,E)","Reasoning: The move (B,7,D) takes the existing `5♥-A♥` sequence from column B and places it onto the `6♥` in column D. This achieves two important goals: it builds a longer same-suit sequence (`6♥-5♥-A♥`) which is crucial for clearing columns, and it uncovers the hidden card at index 6 in column B. Uncovering cards and building sequences are the primary objectives when no 'hit' is possible.\n\nAnswer: (B,7,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  There are no hits remaining, so I must find a valid move.\n2.  Several single-card moves are possible that build same-suit pairs and reveal a hidden card: (C,9,H), (D,9,H), (F,9,A), (G,7,B), (H,8,B), (J,9,I).\n3.  Moving the 4♥ from column G onto the 5♥ in column B (G,7,B) builds a 5♥-4♥ sequence in column B.\n4.  This move reveals the card at G(6), which is a 9♠. Revealing a 9 might be more beneficial than revealing the lower cards exposed by other potential moves (like 6♠ from H, 4♣ from F, or 3♥ from J), as it could potentially move onto a 10.\n\nAnswer: (G,7,B)","Reasoning: Several moves are available that uncover a hidden card and build a small same-suit sequence. Moving the 6♦ from column D to the 7♦ in column H (D,9,H) creates a 7♦-6♦ sequence, uncovers a card at D9, and sets up a potential follow-up move for the 5♦ (D8). This seems like a solid choice among the available options. Other good options include (J,9,I), (F,9,A), and (G,7,B), all of which uncover a card and build sequences. (D,9,H) is chosen as it progresses a mid-rank sequence and immediately enables moving the 5♦.\n\nAnswer: (D,9,H)","Reasoning: The goal is to uncover hidden cards and create sequences, especially since there are no 'hit' chances left. There are several valid moves available: (D,9,H) moving 6♦ onto 7♦, (F,9,A) moving 8♣ onto 9♣, (G,7,B) moving 4♥ onto 5♥, and (J,7,G) moving 3♥ onto 4♥. Both (D,9,H) and (F,9,A) reveal a card from index 8, which is generally better than revealing cards from higher indices (like index 7 for the other moves). Moving 6♦ onto 7♦ (D,9,H) consolidates Diamonds and reveals the card at D8.\n\nAnswer: (D,9,H)","Reasoning: The goal is to build same-suit sequences (K->A) and reveal hidden cards. Moving the 6♦ from column D (index 9) onto the 7♦ in column A (index 7) achieves both: it creates a 7♦-6♦ sequence and reveals the card underneath the 6♦ in column D (which is 5♦). This newly revealed 5♦ can then be moved onto the 6♦ in column A, furthering the sequence and revealing another card in column D. This path seems most productive for uncovering cards and building towards a full sequence. Other potential moves either break suits or don't offer such immediate follow-up potential.\n\nAnswer: (D,9,A)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goals are to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences, ultimately aiming for K->A sequences.\n2.  There are several possible moves that achieve one or both of these goals.\n3.  Moving a Queen onto a King of the same suit is a high-value move as it starts building a potential full sequence from the top down.\n4.  Two such moves are possible: Q♥ (I,5) to K♥ (B,10) `(I,5,B)` and Q♥ (J,5) to K♥ (B,10) `(J,5,B)`. Another is Q♦ (I,7) to K♦ (G,4) `(I,7,G)`.\n5.  Let's compare `(I,5,B)` and `(J,5,B)`:\n    *   `(I,5,B)` reveals 9♥ at I,4. The 8♥ already visible at I,6 could then move onto this 9♥.\n    *   `(J,5,B)` reveals 8♥ at J,4. This 8♥ could then immediately move onto either 9♥ at E,8 or 9♥ at I,4, revealing the card at J,3.\n6.  Revealing a hidden card (J,3) is generally better than only enabling a move that reveals the space just vacated (I,5). The potential for a chain reaction (move Q♥, reveal 8♥, move 8♥, reveal next card) makes `(J,5,B)` slightly more appealing than `(I,5,B)` or `(I,7,G)`.\n7.  Other good moves exist, like `(G,6,C)` (9♠ to 10♠) or `(F,8,A)` (8♣ to 9♣), but starting the K-Q sequence and enabling an immediate follow-up move seems strategically better.\n\nAnswer: (J,5,B)","Reasoning: Moving the 2♦ from column J onto the 3♦ in column I builds a small same-suit sequence (3♦, 2♦). More importantly, this move reveals the card underneath the 2♦ in column J, which is a K♣. Uncovering hidden cards, especially high-value ones like Kings, is crucial for progressing the game.\n\nAnswer: (J,8,I)","Reasoning: The move (J, 5, B) places the Q♥ onto the K♥ in column B, starting a potential K→A sequence for hearts. This is a high-priority action. Furthermore, this move reveals the card at index 4 in column J, which is an 8♥. This 8♥ can potentially be moved onto the 9♥ in column E in a future turn, continuing sequence building and potentially revealing another hidden card. Other moves like consolidating spades with (G, 6, A) or clubs with (E, 5, F) are good, but building from the King down is often more beneficial.\n\nAnswer: (J,5,B)","Reasoning: Moving the 2♦ from column J onto the 3♦ in column I builds a same-suit sequence (3♦-2♦) and reveals the card underneath the 2♦ in column J, which is a Q♦. Revealing hidden cards, especially potentially useful ones like Queens, and building same-suit sequences are key strategies in Spider Solitaire.\n\nAnswer: (J,8,I)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Uncover hidden cards and build sequences. Since hits are unavailable (0 remaining), finding a valid move is mandatory.\n2.  **Analyze Moves:** Several moves are possible that consolidate same-suit runs and reveal hidden cards.\n    *   (B,9,D): Moves 8♦ onto 9♦. Reveals K♥ in column B.\n    *   (J,9,I): Moves 2♦ onto 3♦. Reveals Q♦ in column J.\n    *   (H,8,B): Moves 7♦ onto 8♦. Reveals 6♠ in column H.\n    *   (D,9,H): Moves 6♦ onto 7♦.

Reveals 4♣ in column F.\n    *   (A,8,F): Moves 9♣ onto 10♣. Reveals A♦ in column A.\n3.  **Evaluate:** All these moves uncover a hidden card. Revealing Kings is generally a high priority as they are the base of sequences. Move (B,9,D) reveals K♥. This also progresses a diamond sequence (9♦-8♦). Therefore, this move appears most beneficial.\n\nAnswer: (B,9,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Hits are unavailable.\n2.  **Identify potential moves:** Several moves are possible, including moving single cards to build sequences.\n3.  **Prioritize same-suit moves:** Moves that place a card onto another of the same suit and one rank higher are preferred. Several such moves exist: (B,9,D) [8♦ on 9♦], (C,9,H) [2♣ on 3♣], (D,9,H) [6♦ on 7♦], (F,9,A) [8♣ on 9♣], (G,7,B) [4♥ on 5♥], (H,8,B) [7♦ on 8♦], (J,8,I) [2♦ on 3♦].\n4.  **Evaluate best same-suit move:**\n    *   (B,9,D) reveals A♠. Risky as Aces can block columns early.\n    *   (C,9,H) reveals 10♠. Good.\n    *   (D,9,H) reveals 5♦. Good.\n    *   (F,9,A) reveals 8♣. Good.\n    *   (G,7,B) reveals 9♠. Good.\n    *   (H,8,B) reveals 4♥. Good.\n    *   (J,8,I) reveals 3♥. Good, builds 3♦-2♦ sequence in Col I.\n5.  **Select move:** Comparing (H,8,B) and (J,8,I), both build 2-card diamond sequences and reveal low heart cards. (J,8,I) reveals a 3♥ (slightly better than 4♥) and builds onto the existing sequence in column I. This seems marginally better for consolidation and revealing a lower card.\n\nAnswer: (J,8,I)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Expose hidden cards and build towards K->A sequences.\n2.  **Evaluate King Moves:** Several moves involve placing a Queen onto a King, which directly progresses towards completing sequences:\n    *   (A,6,J): Q♣ -> K♣ (in J) reveals J♠.\n    *   (I,5,C): Q♥ -> K♥ (in C) reveals 9♥.\n    *   (J,5,C): Q♥ -> K♥ (in C) reveals 8♥.\n    *   (I,7,G): Q♦ -> K♦ (in G) reveals Q♥.\n3.  **Analyze (I,7,G):** Moving Q♦ from column I to K♦ in column G reveals the Q♥ at I(6). This Q♥ can then immediately be moved onto the K♥ in column C (move (I,6,C)). This second move reveals the 9♥ at I(5). This sequence builds two separate King sequences (K♦-Q♦ and K♥-Q♥) and reveals two cards in quick succession.\n4.  **Compare:** This sequence seems more immediately beneficial than the other Queen-to-King moves, which only build one sequence and reveal one card initially. Other moves like consolidating runs (e.g., (D,8,H) or (F,7,A)) are good but don't build directly on Kings or guarantee revealing as many useful cards as the (I,7,G) sequence initiation.\n\nTherefore, moving the Q♦ to the K♦ is the best first step.\n\nAnswer: (I,7,G)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to expose hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n1.  Moving 7♦ from H to 8♦ in B (H,8,B) reveals 6♠ in H and creates an 8♦-7♦ sequence.\n2.  Moving 2♦ from J to 3♦ in I (J,8,I) reveals 3♥ in J and creates a 3♦-2♦ sequence.\n3.  Moving A♦ from A to the empty column G (A,9,G) reveals 9♣ in A. This 9♣ can then be moved onto the 10♣ in F (A,8,F), creating a 10♣-9♣ sequence and revealing the next card (7♦) in A. This 7♦ can then potentially move onto the 8♦ in B. This option opens up more follow-up moves compared to the others.\n\nTherefore, starting the chain by moving A♦ to the empty column G appears to be the most promising move.\n\nAnswer: (A,9,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Analyze options:** No 'hit' is possible (0 remaining). Need to find a card\/run move.\n2.  **Identify single card moves:** Several cards can move to build on the card at the bottom of another column:\n    *   (D,9,H): 6♦ onto 7♦. Reveals D[8]=5♦. Builds 7♦-6♦.\n    *   (F,9,A): 8♣ onto 9♣. Reveals F[8]=4♣. Builds 9♣-8♣.\n    *   (G,7,B): 4♥ onto 5♥. Reveals G[6]=9♠. Builds 5♥-4♥.\n    *   (H,8,B): 7♦ onto 8♦. Reveals H[7]=6♠. Builds 8♦-7♦.\n    *   (J,9,I): 2♦ onto 3♦. Reveals J[8]=3♦. Builds 3♦-2♦.\n3.  **Evaluate potential follow-up moves:**\n    *   After (D,9,H), the revealed 5♦ (D[8]) can move onto the 6♦ just placed (H,9). This is move (D,8,H), revealing D[7]. Total: 2 reveals, builds 7♦-6♦-5♦.\n    *   After (F,9,A), the revealed 4♣ (F[8]) has no move. Total: 1 reveal.\n    *   After (G,7,B), the revealed 9♠ (G[6]) can move onto 10♠ (C[8]). This is move (G,6,C), revealing G[5]. Total: 2 reveals, builds 5♥-4♥ and 10♠-9♠.\n    *   After (H,8,B), the revealed 6♠ (H[7]) has no move. Total: 1 reveal.\n    *   After (J,9,I), the revealed 3♦ (J[8]) can move onto 4♥ (G[7]). This is move (J,8,G), revealing J[7]. Total: 2 reveals, builds 3♦-2♦ and 4♥-3♦.\n4.  **Compare best options:** The paths starting with (D,9,H), (G,7,B), and (J,9,I) all reveal two cards and build sequences. The path starting with (G,7,B) seems slightly preferable as it builds two distinct sequences (5♥-4♥ and 10♠-9♠) and reveals a card at index 5 (G[5]), which is slightly deeper than the cards revealed in the other two paths (D[7] and J[7]).\n\nAnswer: (G,7,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  There are no 'hit' chances remaining, so the only option is to make moves using the cards on the board. The priority is to expose hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  Several moves are possible:\n    *   (I, 9, A): Move 2♦ onto A♦. Exposes 3♦. Breaks a 3♦-2♦ sequence and creates a mixed-suit stack (A♦ 2♦). Generally not preferred.\n    *   (G, 8, D): Move 7♦ onto 6♦. Exposes 4♥ in G. Builds a 5♦-6♦-7♦ same-suit sequence in D. Good move.\n    *   (B, 9, G): Move 8♦ onto 7♦. Exposes A♠ in B. Builds a 7♦-8♦ same-suit sequence in G. Good move.\n    *   (D, 8, G): Move 5♦-6♦ run onto 7♦. Exposes 9♦ in D. Creates a mixed-suit stack (7♦ 5♦ 6♦) which is less ideal than building same-suit runs.\n3.  Comparing (G, 8, D) and (B, 9, G): Both build same-suit sequences and expose a card. Exposing the A♠ via (B, 9, G) is slightly preferable to exposing 4♥ via (G, 8, D) because Aces are key cards (can accept a 2 immediately) and uncovering them is important. This move also sets up a potential follow-up move (2♠ in B onto A♠ in E).\n\nAnswer: (B,9,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences (K->A).\n2.  Several moves are available that uncover hidden cards.\n3.  Moving the 2♦ from column J onto the 3♦ in column I (J,8,I) achieves two goals:\n    *   It uncovers the card at J,8, which is a K♣. Uncovering Kings is highly valuable.\n    *   It creates a same-suit sequence (3♦, 2♦) in column I.\n4.  Other moves like (D,8,A) or (D,8,H) also uncover a K♣, but require moving a 2-card run (5♦, 6♦), which is slightly more complex than the single-card move (J,8,I).\n5.  Moves like (F,9,A) or (H,8,B) build sequences and uncover cards, but the cards uncovered (4♣, 6♠) are less critical than a King.\n6.  Therefore, moving the 2♦ to build a sequence and reveal a King is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: (J,8,I)","Reasoning:\n1.  Analyze available moves by checking the bottom card of each column.\n2.  Possible moves include: (A,9,J), (B,9,D), (C,9,H), (D,9,A), (D,9,H), (F,8,A), (G,7,B), (H,8,B), (J,8,I).\n3.  Prioritize moves that uncover hidden cards, build sequences, or uncover high-value cards like Kings.\n4.  The move (J,8,I) moves the 2♦ from column J onto the 3♦ in column I.\n5.  This move uncovers the card at index 7 in column J, which is K♣. Uncovering Kings is strategically important as they can only move to empty columns and uncovering them early increases flexibility later.\n6.  This move also creates a small sequence (3♦-2♦) in column I.\n7.  Other moves uncover potentially useful cards (e.g., 10♠, Q♦) or create sequences, but uncovering a King is generally a higher priority.\n\nAnswer: (J,8,I)","Reasoning: The priority is to reveal hidden cards to open up more potential moves. Moving the 2♣ from column E (index 4) onto the 3♣ in column H (index 4) achieves this by revealing the card at index E3. This move also builds a small same-suit sequence (3♣-2♣). Other moves like building parts of sequences (e.g., Q♥ onto K♥) are good, but revealing hidden cards is often more crucial when not close to clearing a sequence or column. There are no hits remaining, making card revelation even more important.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  Several moves reveal hidden cards.\n3.  Moves that also build same-suit sequences are generally preferred over mixed-suit moves.\n4.  Possible same-suit moves that reveal cards include:\n    *   (J, 9, I): Move 2♦ onto 3♦ (reveals card J[8]). Builds 3♦-2♦. Moves 1 card.\n    *   (A, 8, F): Move 9♣ onto 10♣ (reveals card A[7]). Builds 10♣-9♣. Moves 1 card.\n    *   (A, 6, J): Move Q♣ onto K♣ (reveals card A[5]). Builds K♣-Q♣. Moves 4 cards.\n    *   (A, 5, G): Move J♠ onto Q♠ (reveals card A[4]). Builds Q♠-J♠. Moves 5 cards.\n5.  Moving single cards (like in J,9,I or A,8,F) is less disruptive than moving larger stacks and immediately reveals a card.\n6.  Comparing (J,9,I) and (A,8,F): Both reveal a card in a column with 4 hidden cards and build a 2-card same-suit sequence. (J,9,I) moves 2♦ onto 3♦, consolidating diamonds. This seems like a solid, low-risk move to reveal a card and progress the game.\n\nAnswer: (J,9,I)","Reasoning: The primary goals are to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences, especially aiming for K->A.\n1.  Moving Q♥ from column J (index 5) onto K♥ in column C (index 10) builds a K♥-Q♥ sequence. This is a valuable step towards completing a suit.\n2.  This move reveals the card at J[4], which is 8♥.\n3.  The newly revealed 8♥ at J[4] can then be moved onto the 9♥ at E[8] in a subsequent move, building another same-suit sequence (9♥-8♥) and revealing the card at J[3].\n4.  While moves like (D, 8, G) would reveal a hidden card immediately, the sequence building offered by (J, 5, C) appears more strategically advantageous as it progresses towards completing a suit and sets up another beneficial move.\n\nAnswer: (J,5,C)","Reasoning: The best move should ideally reveal hidden cards and help build same-suit sequences. Moving the 2♦ from column J (index 8) to the 3♦ in column I (index 8) accomplishes both. It extends the diamond sequence in column I to Q♦-3♦-2♦, and it reveals the card at index 7 in column J (which is 3♥). This revealed 3♥ might enable further moves.\n\nAnswer: (J,8,I)","Reasoning: Moving the K♥ from column C to the empty column G is a strong strategic move. It utilizes the empty column, reveals the card beneath the King in column C (2♣), and places the K♥ where it can potentially receive the Q♥-8♥ sequences from columns I and J later, helping to build a full sequence.\n\nAnswer: (C,10,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to build K->A sequences of the same suit.\n2.  Column C has K♥ at index 10.\n3.  Column I has a same-suit run 8♥ -> Q♥ starting at index 6 (cards: 8♥, Q♦, 3♦ below, but the run is just 8♥-Q♥). Wait, re-reading the board: Column I index 6 is 8♥, index 7 is Q♦, index 8 is 3♦. The only movable run starting at 8♥ is just the 8♥ itself. It cannot move to K♥. Let's re-evaluate. Ah, I misread the rules\/board representation slightly. The run must be *contiguous* and *same suit*.\n    - Let's re-examine Column I: 4: 9♥, 5: Q♦, 6: 8♥, 7: Q♦, 8: 3♦. The bottom card is 3♦.\n    - Can 3♦ move? Needs 4. No matching 4 available (4♥ G7, 4♣ F7, 4♥ H5).\n    - Can Q♦ (I7) move? Needs K♦. K♦ is at G4. Yes, (I,7,G). Reveals 8♥ (I6).\n    - Can 8♥ (I6) move? Needs 9♥. 9♥ is at E8 and I4. Can move (I,6,E). Reveals Q♦ (I5).\n    - Can Q♦ (I5) move? Needs K♦. K♦ is at G4. Yes, (I,5,G). Reveals 9♥ (I4).\n    - Can 9♥ (I4) move? Needs 10♥. No 10♥ visible.\n\nLet's re-list available moves carefully, focusing on same-suit runs or single cards:\n*   A: A♦ needs 2♦ (J8). Move (A,9,J). Reveals 9♣(A8).\n*   B: 8♦ needs 9♦ (D7 or F5). Move (B,9,D) or (B,9,F). Reveals A♠(B8).\n*   C: 2♣ needs 3♣ (H4). Move (C,9,H). Reveals 10♠(C8).\n*   D: 6♦ needs 7♦ (A7 or H8). Move (D,7,A) or (D,7,H). Reveals K♣(D6).\n*   D: 2♥ needs 3♥ (J7). Move (D,5,J). Reveals 2♣(D4).\n*   E: 9♥ needs 10♥. None.\n*   E: A♠ needs 2♠ (B6). Move (E,8,B). Reveals 9♥(E7).\n*   E: 7♣ needs 8♣ (F8). Move (E,5,F). Reveals 2♣(E4).\n*   F: 8♣ needs 9♣ (A8). Move (F,8,A). Reveals 4♣(F7).\n*   F: 9♦ needs 10♦. None.\n*   G: 4♥ needs 5♥ (B7). Move (G,7,B). Reveals 9♠(G6).\n*   H: 7♦ needs 8♦ (B9). Move (H,8,B). Reveals 6♠(H7).\n*   H: 4♥ needs 5♥ (B7). Move (H,5,B). Reveals 3♣(H4).\n*   I: 3♦ needs 4♦. None.\n*   I: Q♦ (I7) needs K♦ (G4). Move (I,7,G). Reveals 8♥(I6).\n*   I: 8♥ (I6) needs 9♥ (E8). Move (I,6,E). Reveals Q♦(I5).\n*   I: Q♦ (I5) needs K♦ (G4). Move (I,5,G). Reveals 9♥(I4).\n*   J: 2♦ needs 3♦ (I8). Move (J,8,I). Reveals 3♥(J7).\n*   J: 3♥ needs 4♥ (G7 or H5). Move (J,7,G) or (J,7,H). Reveals K♣(J6).\n\nPriority considerations:\n1.  Uncovering face-down cards is key. All moves do this.\n2.  Creating space (empty columns) is good, but not possible yet.\n3.  Building sequences, especially same-suit, is crucial. None build significant sequences directly.\n4.  Uncovering potentially useful cards (Kings, Aces, cards that enable other moves).\n    - (D,7,A) or (D,7,H) reveals K♣. Kings are valuable for building on.\n    - (B,9,D) or (B,9,F) reveals A♠. Aces are needed for sequences.\n    - (J,7,G) or (J,7,H) reveals K♣.\n\nComparing revealing K♣ vs A♠: Revealing a King allows building on it immediately if the Queen is available. Revealing an Ace is less immediately useful but necessary eventually. Revealing K♣ seems slightly better. Let's look at the K♣ reveal options:\n- (D,7,A): Move 6♦ to 7♦(A7). Reveals K♣(D6). Uncovers 5♦(D8).\n- (D,7,H): Move 6♦ to 7♦(H8). Reveals K♣(D6). Uncovers 5♦(D8). Destination column H has 7♦ at the bottom currently.\n- (J,7,G): Move 3♥ to 4♥(G7). Reveals K♣(J6). Uncovers Q♥(J5). Destination column G has 4♥ at the bottom.\n- (J,7,H): Move 3♥ to 4♥(H5). Reveals K♣(J6). Uncovers Q♥(J5). Destination column H has 4♥ at the bottom.\n\nMoving 3♥ (J,7,G or J,7,H) reveals a K♣ and uncovers a Q♥ below it, which might be useful later. Moving 6♦ (D,7,A or D,7,H) reveals a K♣ and uncovers a 5♦. Revealing K♣ under 3♥ seems slightly better as it's a shorter stack in J (4 hidden) vs D (3 hidden). Also, uncovering Q♥ might be useful. Let's choose (J,7,G).\n\nFinal check: Moving 3♥ from J(7) to 4♥ at G(7). This is valid. It reveals K♣ at J(6).\n\nAnswer: (J,7,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards and build sequences.\n2.  Moving 2♣ from column C (index 9) onto 3♣ in column H (index 4) is a legal move.\n3.  This move (C,9,H) will uncover the hidden card at C,9, revealing 10♠.\n4.  Revealing the 10♠ immediately creates an opportunity to move the 9♠ from column G (index 6) onto the 10♠, consolidating a same-suit sequence. This is a strong follow-up move.\n5.  Other potential moves, like moving 4♥ (G,7) to 5♥ (B,7), uncover cards but don't immediately set up such a beneficial sequence consolidation.\n6.  Since 'hit' is not available, uncovering cards and consolidating sequences is crucial.\n\nAnswer: (C,9,H)","Reasoning: The best move is (B,9,D). This moves the 8♦ onto the 9♦ in column D. This action reveals the A♠ in column B, which is valuable. Furthermore, this move enables a sequence of subsequent beneficial moves: moving 7♦ (H) onto the 8♦ (D), then moving the 6♦ (D) onto the 7♦ (D), and then moving the 5♦ (D) onto the 6♦ (D). This chain reveals multiple hidden cards (A♠, 6♠, K♣) and builds a substantial same-suit sequence (9♦ to 5♦) in column D. Revealing hidden cards and consolidating same-suit runs are high priorities, especially since no more cards can be dealt ('hit').\n\nAnswer: (B,9,D)","Reasoning: Several moves are possible that consolidate same-suit sequences and reveal a hidden card.\n- (A,8,F): Moves 9♣ onto 10♣, reveals A♦.\n- (C,9,H): Moves 2♣ onto 3♣, reveals 10♠.\n- (D,9,A) or (D,9,H): Moves 6♦ onto 7♦, reveals 5♦.\n- (F,8,A): Moves 8♣ onto 9♣, reveals 4♣.\n- (G,7,B): Moves 4♥ onto 5♥, reveals 9♠.\n- (H,7,F): Moves 6♠ onto 7♠, reveals K♦.\n- (J,8,I): Moves 2♦ onto 3♦, reveals Q♦.\n\nRevealing a King is often a good strategic move as Kings are the base of sequences and can utilize empty columns. Moving the 6♠ from H onto the 7♠ in F achieves this by revealing the K♦ at H[6]. This move also creates a small 7♠-6♠ sequence.\n\nAnswer: (H,7,F)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to build K->A sequences. Placing cards onto higher-ranked cards of the same suit progresses this goal.\n2.  Moving a Q onto a K of the same suit is a high-priority move.\n3.  There are two such moves available: Q♥ from I onto K♥ in C, and Q♥ from J onto K♥ in C. Also Q♦ from I onto K♦ in G.\n4.  Moving Q♥ from I (index 5) to C reveals the card at I(6), which is 8♥. This creates a K♥, Q♥ sequence in C.\n5.  Moving Q♥ from J (index 5) to C reveals the card at J(6), which is K♣. This also creates a K♥, Q♥ sequence in C.\n6.  Moving Q♦ (run starts at index 7) from I to G reveals the card at I(6), which is 8♥. This creates a K♦, Q♦ sequence in G.\n7.  Comparing (I,5,C) and (J,5,C): Both achieve the K♥,Q♥ sequence. (I,5,C) reveals 8♥, which might be playable soon. (J,5,C) reveals K♣, which is less immediately useful without an empty column.\n8.  Comparing (I,5,C) and (I,7,G): Both reveal 8♥ in column I. Both build Queen onto King sequences. Either is a strong move. Let's choose the heart sequence.\n9.  Therefore, moving the Q♥ from column I onto the K♥ in column C is a strong move that builds a sequence and reveals a potentially useful card (8♥).\n\nAnswer: (I,5,C)","Reasoning: The primary goal with no hits remaining is to uncover hidden cards and build sequences. Several moves reveal cards at index 9, the deepest possible level: (A,8,F) reveals A♦, (B,8,C) reveals 8♦, and (B,10,G) reveals 8♦. Moving the K♥ via (B,10,G) uses the valuable empty column G just to reveal one card, which seems suboptimal compared to the other options that also build sequences. Comparing (A,8,F) and (B,8,C), both reveal at index 9 and create a 2-card sequence. However, (A,8,F) reveals A♦. This A♦ can immediately be moved onto the 2♦ in column J in the subsequent move, which would then reveal the card at A[8] (9♣). This potential chain reaction to reveal multiple cards makes (A,8,F) the slightly superior choice.\n\nAnswer: (A,8,F)","Reasoning: The goal is to build sequences and reveal hidden cards. Moving the 9♠ from column G onto the 10♠ in column C builds a same-suit sequence (10♠-9♠). This action also reveals the card underneath the 9♠ in column G (which is 4♥), potentially opening up more moves. Moving 3♥ (J) to 4♥ (G) is also possible, but building the spade sequence seems slightly more productive right now.\nAnswer: (G,6,C)","Reasoning: Several moves reveal hidden cards. Among these, moving cards to build same-suit sequences is generally preferred. Moves (C,9,H), (F,8,A), (G,7,B), (H,8,B), and (J,9,I) all build same-suit sequences and reveal a card. Both (H,8,B) and (J,9,I) reveal a Queen (Q♦), which is a high-value reveal.

Moving the 6♦ from column D onto the 7♦ in column H achieves both. It reveals the card at index 8 in column D (the 5♦) and creates a 7♦-6♦ sequence in column H. Furthermore, the revealed 5♦ can then be moved onto the 6♦, extending the sequence.\n\nAnswer: (D,9,H)","Reasoning: The goal is to build sequences and uncover hidden cards. Moving the Q♥ from column I onto the K♥ in column B achieves both: it continues a heart sequence (K♥, Q♥) and uncovers the card at index 5 in column I (8♥).

Moving the 7♦ from column H onto the 8♦ in column B (H,8,B) creates a same-suit run (8♦ 7♦) and reveals the Q♦ in column H.

(I,6,E) achieves both, moving 8♥ onto 9♥ (building a sequence) and exposing the Q♥ at I,5. Exposing a higher-rank card like a Queen can be strategically useful.\n\nAnswer: (I,6,E)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify possible moves, prioritizing those that create same-suit sequences or reveal helpful cards.\n2.  Possible same-suit moves:\n    *   (B,9,D): 8♦ onto 9♦. Reveals A♠.

Evaluate the revealed cards and potential follow-up moves.\n    *   Moving (J,8,I) reveals Q♦ (J,7). This Q♦ can immediately be moved onto the K♦ at (G,4), creating a K♦-Q♦ same-suit sequence. This is a very strong follow-up.\n    *   Moving (C,9,H) reveals 10♠ (C,8). This 10♠ can be moved onto J♠ (A,5), creating J♠-10♠ and revealing a hidden card. This is also good.\n    *   Moving (H,8,B) reveals 6♠ (H,8). This 6♠ can be moved onto 7♠ (F,4), creating 7♠-6♠ and revealing 4♥. Good, but maybe less impactful than the other two.\n4.  Comparing the move (J,8,I) followed by (J,7,G) with (C,9,H) followed by (C,8,A): Building the K♦-Q♦ sequence seems slightly more advantageous for progressing towards completing a suit compared to building J♠-10♠, even though the latter reveals a hidden card. The K♦ is less buried than the J♠.\n5.

Exposing Kings is valuable, but uncovering a hidden card generally takes precedence as it reveals more information.\n    *   **(H,4,C):** Moving 3♣ from H to 2♣ at C exposes K♦ at H3. This builds a small sequence but doesn't utilize the empty column and potentially blocks future moves into C.\n    *   Other sequence-building moves like (D,9,H) or (H,8,B) are useful but don't uncover cards or expose Kings immediately.\n4.  **Best Choice:** Moving the 2♣-7♣ run from E to G (E,4,G) seems the most strategic first step. It directly addresses the priority of uncovering hidden cards and utilizes the empty column. Furthermore, it exposes 2♥ at E4, which immediately enables moving the 3♥ from J7 to E4 (J,7,E), exposing the K♣ at J8 in the subsequent move. This sequence of uncovering a card and then exposing a King is highly beneficial.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  There are no 'hit' chances left, so I must find a move.\n2.  The primary goals are to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences, especially K->A.\n3.  Moving a Queen onto a King of the same suit is a strong move towards building a sequence.\n4.  There are three such moves available:\n    *   Q♥ from column I (index 5) to K♥ in column B (index 10). Move: (I,5,B). Uncovers 9♥ in I.\n    *   Q♥ from column J (index 5) to K♥ in column B (index 10). Move: (J,5,B). Uncovers 8♥ in J.\n    *   Q♦ from column I (index 6) to K♦ in column G (index 4). Move: (I,6,G). Uncovers Q♥ in I.\n5.  Move (I,6,G) builds a Q♦-K♦ sequence and reveals Q♥ at index 5 in column I. Revealing a Queen seems potentially more valuable than revealing a 9 or 8, and it progresses the Diamond sequence build.\n\nAnswer: (I,6,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards ('XX') to reveal more potential moves and build sequences.\n2.  Moving A♦ from Column A (index 9) onto 2♦ in Column J (index 8) is a valid move: (A,9,J).\n3.  This move reveals the card at A,8, which is 9♣.\n4.  This 9♣ can then be moved to 10♣ in Column F (F,6), revealing A,7 (7♦).\n5.  This 7♦ can then be moved to 8♦ in Column B (B,9), revealing A,6 (Q♣).\n6.  This Q♣ can then be moved to K♣ in Column D (D,6), revealing A,5 (J♠).\n7.  This J♠ can then be moved to Q♠ in Column G (G,5), revealing A,4 (XX).\n8.  Therefore, the initial move (A,9,J) initiates a sequence that can potentially reveal five hidden cards in Column A, significantly improving the board state. Other moves reveal fewer cards or don't unlock such a promising sequence.\n\nAnswer: (A,9,J)","Reasoning: Moving the A♠ from column B onto the 2♠ in column C builds a small same-suit sequence (A♠-2♠) and, more importantly, reveals the 8♦ underneath in column B. This revealed 8♦ can then potentially be moved onto the 9♦ in column F, which would expose another hidden card (K♥) in column B. Uncovering hidden cards is key to progressing in Spider Solitaire, especially when no 'hit' actions are available.\nAnswer: (B,8,C)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify possible moves: Check which cards or same-suit runs can be moved onto the top card of another column.\n2.  Evaluate moves based on heuristics:\n    *   Prioritize moves that reveal hidden cards ('XX').\n    *   Prioritize moves that create or extend same-suit sequences.\n    *   Prioritize moves that expose potentially useful cards (like Aces or Kings).\n    *   Consider moves that could lead to emptying a column.\n3.  Compare potential moves:\n    *   (D,8,H): Moves the 5♦ 6♦ run from column D onto the 7♦ (top card) in column H. This builds a 3-card sequence (7♦ 6♦ 5♦) and exposes the A♠ at D,7. This is a strong move as it progresses sequence building and reveals a potentially useful card.\n    *   (I,6,E): Moves 8♥ onto 9♥. Builds a 2-card sequence and reveals Q♦. Good, but building a 3-card sequence and revealing an Ace is better.\n    *   (J,8,I): Moves 2♦ onto 3♦. Builds a 2-card sequence and reveals 3♥. Good, but less impactful than (D,8,H).\n    *   (A,9,J): Moves A♦ onto 2♦. Builds a 2-card sequence and reveals 9♣. Good, but less impactful than (D,8,H).\n    *   (J,7,G): Moves 3♥ onto 4♥. Builds a 2-card sequence and reveals K♣. Good, but revealing an Ace might be slightly more flexible than revealing a King at this stage.\n\n4.  Conclusion: Moving the 5♦ 6♦ run from D to H (D,8,H) offers the best combination of building a sequence and revealing a valuable card (A♠).\n\nAnswer: (D,8,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. No 'hit' option remains.\n2.  **Identify Potential Moves:** Several moves are possible, including moving single cards or same-suit runs.\n3.  **Prioritize Same-Suit & Uncovering:** Moves that build same-suit sequences and uncover hidden cards are generally best.\n    *   (A, 9, J): A♦ -> 2♦ (Uncovers 9♣)\n    *   (B, 9, D): 8♦ -> 9♦ (Uncovers A♠) - Builds Diamond seq.\n    *   (C, 9, H): 2♣ -> 3♣ (Uncovers 10♠) - Builds Club seq.\n    *   (D, 9, A): 6♦ -> 7♦ (Uncovers 5♦) - Builds Diamond seq.\n    *   (D, 9, H): 6♦ -> 7♦ (Uncovers 5♦) - Builds Diamond seq.\n    *   (F, 9, A): 8♣ -> 9♣ (Uncovers 4♣) - Builds Club seq.\n    *   (G, 7, B): 4♥ -> 5♥ (Uncovers 9♠) - Builds Heart seq.\n    *   (H, 8, B): 7♦ -> 8♦ (Uncovers 6♠) - Builds Diamond seq.\n    *   (J, 9, I): 2♦ -> 3♦ (Uncovers 3♥) - Builds Diamond seq.\n4.  **Evaluate Best Options:**\n    *   Moves (B,9,D), (D,9,A), (D,9,H), (F,9,A), (G,7,B), (H,8,B), (J,9,I) all build same-suit sequences and uncover a card.\n    *   Moving 6♦ from D onto 7♦ (either A or H) looks particularly promising. Let's choose (D,9,A). This move uncovers 5♦ in column D.\n    *   Crucially, after (D,9,A), the newly revealed 5♦ in column D can *immediately* be moved onto the 6♦ in column A (move (D,8,A)). This creates a 7♦-6♦-5♦ sequence in column A and uncovers the next card in column D (9♦).\n    *   This two-step sequence significantly progresses the game by building a longer same-suit sequence and uncovering two cards. Starting with (D,9,A) enables this productive sequence.\n\nAnswer: (D,9,A)","Reasoning: The move `(H,4,F)` moves the 3♣ from column H onto the 4♣ in column F. This builds a same-suit sequence (4♣-3♣) and, crucially, uncovers the card at H5, which is a King (K♦). Revealing Kings is a high priority in Spider Solitaire as they are needed to start the final K->A sequences and can potentially free up columns if moved to an empty space (though none are currently empty). Uncovering any hidden card is generally good, but uncovering a King is particularly valuable.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,F)","Reasoning:\n1.  There are no 'hit' chances remaining, so we must find a move on the board.\n2.  There are no empty columns, and no moves available that would create an empty column or uncover a hidden card.\n3.  The next best strategy is to consolidate same-suit runs.\n4.  Moving the 2♠ from column B (index 6) onto the 3♠ in column C (index 5) is possible.\n5.  This move (B,6,C) consolidates a ♠ run (3♠, 2♠) in column C.\n6.  It also exposes the 5♥ at index 5 in column B, which could potentially move onto the 6♥ in column D later.\n7.  Other possible consolidation moves, like moving 2♦ (G,11,I) or (I,10,F), seem slightly less advantageous as they either consolidate higher-ranked cards or expose cards with fewer immediate prospects.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,C)","Reasoning: Creating an empty column offers the most strategic flexibility. Moving the 4♣ from column J onto the 5♣ in column G achieves this, while also consolidating a same-suit sequence.\n\nAnswer: (J,10,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  **Identify potential moves:** There are many possible moves. We should prioritize those that reveal hidden cards or create\/extend same-suit sequences.\n3.  **Evaluate promising moves:**\n    *   (I,7,E): Move 8♥ onto 9♥. This builds a 9♥-8♥ sequence on column E and reveals the card at index 6 in column I (which is Q♥).\n    *   (J,5,E): Move 8♥ onto 9♥. This also builds 9♥-8♥ on E but reveals the card at index 4 in column J (which is 8♥). Less immediately useful than revealing a Queen.\n    *   (E,9,G): Move J♠ onto Q♠. Builds Q♠-J♠ sequence on column G and reveals the card at index 8 in column E (which is 9♥). Good sequence building, but reveals a lower-value card than (I,7,E).\n    *   Other moves like moving clubs (e.g., (E,5,F), (F,7,G)) reveal cards but don't seem as impactful as revealing the Q♥.\n4.  **Select best move:** Moving the 8♥ from column I to column E (I,7,E) achieves two goals: it creates a same-suit run (9♥-8♥) and reveals a potentially valuable card (Q♥) at I[6]. This Q♥ can then potentially be moved onto the K♥ in column B in a subsequent turn.\n\nAnswer: (I,7,E)","Reasoning: The primary goals are to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Several good moves are available:\n1.  `(E,9,G)`: Moves J♠ onto Q♠, creating a same-suit Q♠-J♠ run and revealing E(8).\n2.  `(G,11,F)`: Moves 3♣ onto 4♣, creating a same-suit 4♣-3♣ run and revealing G(10).\n3.  `(H,9,D)` or `(H,9,J)`: Moves Q♣ onto K♣, creating a same-suit K♣-Q♣ run and revealing H(8).\n4.  `(I,9,F)`: Moves 2♦ onto 3♦, creating a same-suit 3♦-2♦ run and revealing I(8).\n\nMoving the Q♣ onto a K♣ (moves 3) seems most beneficial as it involves high-rank cards, directly working towards completing a sequence from the King down. Choosing column D over J consolidates onto an existing K♣. This move creates a K♣-Q♣ run and reveals a new card (7♦) in column H.\n\nAnswer: (H,9,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to build full K->A sequences. Starting these sequences is crucial.\n2.  There are no more 'hit' chances available. Moves must be found.\n3.  Several potential moves exist that create same-suit runs:\n    *   (A,5,G): J♠ onto Q♠ (reveals A♦ in A)\n    *   (D,5,J): 2♥ onto 3♥ (reveals 9♦ in D)\n    *   (E,5,F): 7♣ onto 8♣ (reveals 5♠ in E)\n    *   (H,5,B): 4♥ onto 5♥ (reveals J♦ in H)\n    *   (I,5,B): Q♥ onto K♥ (reveals 8♥ in I)\n    *   (J,5,B): Q♥ onto K♥ (reveals K♣ in J)\n4.  Moving a Q onto a K of the same suit is generally a very strong move as it begins the sequence. Both (I,5,B) and (J,5,B) achieve this, moving Q♥ onto K♥ in column B.\n5.  Comparing (I,5,B) and (J,5,B):\n    *   (I,5,B) moves Q♥ from column I onto K♥ in B. This reveals the 8♥ at I,6. The card above it (I,4) is 9♥. This revealed 8♥ can potentially be moved onto the 9♥ soon.\n    *   (J,5,B) moves Q♥ from column J onto K♥ in B. This reveals K♣ at J,6. Revealing a King can block a column if nothing can be moved onto it.\n6.  Therefore, (I,5,B) is preferable as it starts the K♥ sequence and reveals a card (8♥) that is immediately useful for continuing a sequence build (potentially onto the 9♥ in the same column I), whereas (J,5,B) reveals a potentially blocking King.\n\nAnswer: (I,5,B)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards and organize cards into same-suit descending sequences. There are no available 'hit' actions. Several moves reveal hidden cards:\n- (D,7,A): Move 5♦ onto 6♦. Reveals 9♦. Creates 6♦ 5♦.\n- (F,8,A): Move 8♣ onto 9♣. Reveals 3♦. Creates 9♣ 8♣.\n- (F,6,G): Move 4♣ onto 5♣. Reveals 9♦ (at F,5). Creates 6♣ 5♣ 4♣.\n- (G,10,F): Move 2♦ onto 3♦. Reveals 5♣. Creates 3♦ 2♦.\n- (H,10,J): Move Q♣ onto K♣. Reveals 7♦. Creates K♣ Q♣.\n- (H,11,G): Move 4♣ onto 5♣. Reveals Q♣. Creates 5♣ 4♣.\n- (I,8,G): Move Q♦ onto K♦. Reveals 8♥. Creates K♦ Q♦.\n- (I,6,E): Move 8♥ onto 9♥. Reveals Q♥. Creates 9♥ 8♥.\n- (J,7,G): Move 3♥ onto 4♥. Reveals K♣. Creates 4♥ 3♥.\n\nComparing these, the move (F,6,G) is slightly preferable because it creates the longest same-suit sequence immediately (6♣ 5♣ 4♣) while also revealing a hidden card (9♦ in column F). Organizing suits is crucial for eventually clearing sequences.\n\nAnswer: (F,6,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  There are no empty columns, and no hits remaining. I must find a valid move.\n2.  The primary goal is to expose hidden cards and build same-suit sequences, especially starting from Kings.\n3.  Several moves are possible:\n    *   Moving Q♥ from column I (index 5) onto K♥ in column B (index 10) is possible: (I, 5, B). This builds a K♥-Q♥ sequence and exposes the 9♥ at I,4.\n    *   Moving Q♥ from column J (index 5) onto K♥ in column B (index 10) is also possible: (J, 5, B). This builds a K♥-Q♥ sequence and exposes the 8♥ at J,4.\n    *   Moving Q♣ from column H (index 9) onto K♣ in column D (index 6) or column J (index 6) is possible: (H, 9, D) or (H, 9, J). This builds a K♣-Q♣ sequence and exposes the 7♦ at H,8.\n    *   Moving J♠ from column E (index 8) onto Q♠ in column G (index 5) is possible: (E, 8, G). This builds Q♠-J♠ and exposes 9♥ at E,7.\n    *   Moving the 10♠-9♠ sequence from C (index 8) onto J♠ in A (index 5) is possible: (C, 8, A). This builds J♠-10♠-9♠ and exposes 2♣ at C,9.\n    *   Other shorter sequence moves exist, like (B,6,C), (H,6,I), etc.\n4.  Comparing the moves that build on Kings or Queens: (I, 5, B), (J, 5, B), (H, 9, D\/J), (E, 8, G), (C, 8, A).\n5.  Starting the K♥ sequence seems very promising. Choosing (I, 5, B) exposes 9♥ at I,4. This immediately enables another move: moving the 8♥ from J,4 onto the newly exposed 9♥ at I,4. This second move (J, 4, I) would expose the hidden card at J,3. This chain reaction of exposing cards makes (I, 5, B) a strong candidate.\n6.  Therefore, moving the Q♥ from I to B is the best first step.\n\nAnswer: (I,5,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards to gain more information and enable further moves.\n2.  Several moves can uncover face-down cards: (D,5,J), (J,9,F), (J,9,I).\n3.  Move (D,5,J) involves moving 2♥ from column D (index 5) to 3♥ in column J (index 7). This uncovers the card at D4. Column D is relatively short (5 cards before the move), making uncovering cards here potentially more impactful than in very long columns like J.\n4.  Moves (J,9,F) and (J,9,I) uncover the card at J8, but column J is very long (12 cards). Uncovering cards deep in long stacks is generally less immediately useful.\n5.  Other moves build sequences or uncover known cards, such as (C,9,H) uncovering 10♠, or (I,7,G) building K♦ Q♦. While good, uncovering a hidden card is typically prioritized.\n6.  Therefore, moving the 2♥ to build a sequence and uncover a hidden card in column D is the best strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,J)","1.  **Reasoning:** The primary goals are to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Several moves achieve this:\n    *   Moving 5♣ 6♣ from G onto 7♣ (C or E) reveals a card and creates a 3-card sequence.\n    *   Moving 6♠ from H onto 7♠ (F) reveals a card and creates a 2-card sequence.\n    *   Moving 3♥ from I onto 4♥ (G or H) reveals a card and creates a 2-card sequence.\n    *   Moving 3♣ from J onto 4♣ (F) reveals a card and creates a 2-card sequence.\n    *   Moving 8♦ from B onto 9♦ (D) reveals a card and creates a 2-card sequence.\n\n    Comparing these, moving 3♣ from J onto 4♣ at F (column J index 11 to column F) seems most promising because it uncovers J(10), which is K♣. Revealing a King is strategically valuable as it can potentially receive a Queen later, helping to build a full sequence or clear space. This move also creates a small 4♣ 3♣ sequence on column F. While moving 5♣ 6♣ (G->C or G->E) creates a longer sequence, uncovering the King in the longest column (J) offers more long-term potential. Moving 3♣ to F does not block other potential suit-building moves.\n\n2.  **Final Answer:**\n    Answer: (J,11,F)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goals are to expose hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  Several moves are possible:\n    *   (D,9,A): 5♦ -> 6♦. Exposes 9♦. Creates 6♦-5♦ run.\n    *   (E,9,G): J♠ -> Q♠. Exposes 9♥. Creates Q♠-J♠ run.\n    *   (G,10,F) or (G,10,I): 2♦ -> 3♦. Exposes 5♣. Creates 3♦-2♦ run.\n    *   (H,10,G): 4♣ -> 5♣. Exposes Q♣. Creates 6♣-5♣-4♣ run.\n    *   (I,6,E): 8♥ -> 9♥. Exposes Q♦. Creates 9♥-8♥ run.\n    *   (I,9,F): 2♦ -> 3♦. Exposes 3♦. Creates 3♦-2♦ run.\n    *   (J,7,G) or (J,7,H): 3♥ -> 4♥. Exposes K♣. Creates 4♥-3♥ run.\n3.  Comparing these moves:\n    *   Exposing a King (J,7,G or J,7,H) is good, but there are no empty columns to move it to immediately.\n    *   Move (H,10,G) creates the longest same-suit sequence (6♣-5♣-4♣). Consolidating suits like this is generally beneficial for future moves and potentially clearing columns. It also exposes a Queen (Q♣).\n4.  Therefore, creating the 3-card club sequence seems the most constructive move.\n\nAnswer: (H,10,G)","Reasoning: The primary goal with no hits available is to expose hidden cards. Moving the 3♥ from column J onto the 4♥ in column G achieves this by revealing the card at J[6]. This move also builds a small same-suit sequence (4♥-3♥) in column G. Exposing hidden cards, especially potential Kings or cards that enable further sequence building, is crucial at this stage. Uncovering the K♣ in column J is particularly valuable.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to build K->A sequences. Moves that consolidate same-suit runs are preferred.\n2.  Moves that reveal hidden cards (XX) or face-down cards are valuable.\n3.  Moves that build onto Kings are particularly useful for starting sequences.\n4.  There are no more 'hit' chances available.\n5.  Several moves are possible: (A,5,G), (D,5,J), (E,5,F), (F,5,C), (H,5,B), (I,5,B), (J,5,B).\n6.  Moves (I,5,B) and (J,5,B) both involve moving a Q♥ onto the K♥ in column B, advancing a potential Heart sequence.\n7.  Move (I,5,B) moves Q♥ from column I to K♥ in column B. This reveals the 8♥ at I(6).\n8.  Move (J,5,B) moves Q♥ from column J to K♥ in column B. This reveals the K♣ at J(6).\n9.  Revealing a King (K♣) is generally more impactful than revealing an 8♥, as Kings are the base of sequences and uncovering them can open up significant possibilities or clear columns later. Therefore, (J,5,B) is slightly preferable.\n\nAnswer: (J,5,B)","Reasoning: Moving the Q♥ from column J onto the K♥ in column B builds a same-suit sequence (K♥-Q♥). Crucially, this move also reveals the card underneath the Q♥ in column J, which is a K♣. This King can immediately accept the Q♣ from column H, which would then reveal another card in column H. This chain of potential moves seems the most likely to open up the board and reveal useful cards compared to other available moves.\n\nAnswer: (J,1,B)","Reasoning: Several moves are available that reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Moving the Q♣ from column H onto one of the K♣ in columns D or J seems promising as it progresses towards a King sequence and reveals the 7♦ in H. Choosing column D (H,9,D) places the K♣, Q♣ sequence on the King with fewer cards underneath it, potentially making it easier to clear later. This move also reveals a 7♦, which could potentially connect with the 6♦ in column A later.\n\nAnswer: (H,9,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal with no 'hit' options left and few epochs remaining is to reveal hidden cards (XX) to uncover potential plays.\n2.  Several moves reveal cards. Moves revealing XX cards are generally prioritized over moves revealing already face-up cards further up a column.\n3.  Moves that reveal XX cards include:\n    *   (E,4,H,4): Moves 2♣ onto 3♣, reveals E:3 (XX).\n    *   (J,4,E,8): Moves 8♥ onto 9♥, reveals J:3 (XX).\n    *   (J,4,I,4): Moves 8♥ onto 9♥, reveals J:3 (XX).\n4.  All three reveal a card at level 3. Moving the 8♥ (J,4) builds a sequence (9♥-8♥) which is slightly more constructive than moving the 2♣ (E,4).\n5.  Comparing (J,4,E,8) and (J,4,I,4): Both move 8♥ to a 9♥ and reveal J:3.\n    *   Moving to E (J,4,E,8) places the 8♥ onto 9♥ at E,8. Column E has 10 cards.\n    *   Moving to I (J,4,I,4) places the 8♥ onto 9♥ at I,4. Column I has 11 cards.\n6.  Placing the sequence lower down (on E,8) keeps the top of column E more accessible. Column E is also shorter. Therefore, (J,4,E,8) seems slightly preferable.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,E,8)","Reasoning: The priority is to reveal hidden cards and create same-suit sequences. Moving the J♠ from column A (index 5) onto the Q♠ in column G (index 5) achieves both: it reveals the hidden card at A4 and builds the Q♠-J♠ sequence. While moving 2♥ from D to 3♥ on J also reveals a hidden card and builds a sequence, consolidating the higher-ranked spades seems slightly more beneficial.\n\nAnswer: (A,5,G)","Reasoning: There are multiple possible moves involving same-suit runs.\n- (E,9,G): J♠ onto Q♠. Good, exposes 9♥.\n- (F,11,G) or (F,11,J): 3♣ onto 4♣. Good, exposes 2♦. This 2♦ could then go onto 3♦ at I(8) or F(9).\n- (G,10,H): 4♣ onto 5♣. Good, exposes 6♣. This 6♣ could then go onto 7♣ at E(5) or C(6).\n- (H,9,D): Q♣ onto K♣. Good, exposes 7♦. This 7♦ could then go onto 8♦ at B(9).\n- (I,9,F): 2♦ onto 3♦. Good, exposes Q♦. This Q♦ could then go onto K♦ at G(4).\n\nComparing these options, the move (I,9,F) seems particularly strong. It consolidates a diamond pair (3♦-2♦) and exposes a Q♦. This Q♦ can immediately be moved onto the K♦ in column G in the next step, creating a K♦-Q♦ sequence and exposing the card currently hidden under the K♦ (G,4). This sequence of two same-suit moves that exposes a card under a King is highly valuable.\n\nAnswer: (I,9,F)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.

Uncovers 8♥ on J. Builds a K-Q sequence. Good.\n    *   **(G,10,I):** Moves 2♦ to 3♦. Uncovers 5♣ on G. Builds Q♦-3♦-2♦ sequence. Good.\n    *   **(I,7,G):** Moves Q♦-3♦-2♦ to K♦. Uncovers 8♥ on I. Builds K♦-Q♦-3♦-2♦ sequence. Good, but blocks G column.\n    *   **(C,8,E):** Moves 10♠-9♠ to J♠. Uncovers A♠ on C. Builds Q♠-J♠-10♠-9♠ sequence. Excellent.\n4.  **Decision:** Moving the 10♠-9♠ run from column C to column E (onto the J♠) achieves two key objectives:\n    *   It uncovers the A♠ in column C, which is highly valuable as an Ace.\n    *   It builds a significant same-suit sequence (Q♠-J♠-10♠-9♠) in column E.\n    This appears to be the most strategically advantageous move currently available.\n\nAnswer: (C,8,E)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal with no hits remaining and many hidden cards is to uncover hidden cards.\n2.  Identify all valid moves:\n    *   (E, 9, G): J♠ onto Q♠.

Evaluate the moves based on their potential to uncover cards or create opportunities.\n4.  Move (I, 9, F) uncovers I[8] (which is 3♦). This immediately enables a subsequent move: (J, 9, I), moving the 2♦ from column J onto the newly revealed 3♦ in column I. This second move empties column J.\n5.  Creating an empty column is highly valuable in Spider Solitaire as it provides space for rearranging sequences and uncovering more cards.\n6.  Other moves like (G, 10, I) also uncover a card (G[9] = 5♣) and enable a follow-up move (F, 7, G), uncovering F[6] (10♣). However, this sequence uncovers two cards but doesn't create an empty column.\n7.  Prioritizing the move sequence that leads to an empty column is strategically better. Therefore, the first step in that sequence, (I, 9, F), is the best immediate action.\n\nAnswer: (I,9,F)","Reasoning:\n1.  There are no more 'hit' opportunities available.\n2.  The priority is to uncover hidden cards ('XX') by moving face-up cards.\n3.  Several moves are possible that uncover hidden cards: (E,9,G), (G,11,F), (H,9,D), (H,9,J), (I,9,F), (J,7,H).\n4.  Moving 3♥ from J onto 4♥ in H (J,7,H) uncovers the K♣ in column J. Revealing Kings is generally beneficial as they form the base of the target sequences. This move also creates a same-suit sequence (4♥-3♥) and potentially enables further moves, such as moving Q♣ (H,9) onto the newly revealed K♣ (J,6).\n\nAnswer: (J,7,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. No 'hit' available.\n2.  **Priority:** Revealing cards highest up in the columns is generally the best strategy to uncover more potential moves.\n3.  **Candidate Moves Revealing Hidden Cards:**\n    *   (I, 5, B): Moves Q♥ (I5) onto K♥ (B). Reveals I4 (9♥). Builds K♥-Q♥.\n    *   (J, 5, B): Moves Q♥ (J5) onto K♥ (B). Reveals J4 (8♥). Builds K♥-Q♥.\n    *   Other moves reveal cards lower down (index 5 or deeper).\n4.  **Selection:** Both (I, 5, B) and (J, 5, B) reveal a card at index 4 and create a K♥-Q♥ sequence. Revealing the 9♥ via (I, 5, B) might connect better with other visible 8s (like J4). Therefore, (I, 5, B) is chosen as it reveals the highest card (index 4) and builds a valuable same-suit sequence on a King.\n\nAnswer: (I,5,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards, especially those buried deep in the columns.\n2.  Several moves can reveal hidden cards. Let's evaluate them based on the depth of the revealed card:\n    *   Moving 2♦ from H (index 7) reveals H[7]. This is the deepest potential reveal. Possible destinations are 3♦ in F, H, or I. (H,7,I) is a valid move.\n    *   Moving 2♦ from F (index 6) reveals F[6].\n    *   Moving Q♣ from H (index 6) reveals H[6].\n    *   Moving A♦ from A (index 4) reveals A[5].\n    *   Moving the 6♣,5♣,4♣ run from G (index 4) reveals G[4].\n    *   Other moves reveal cards at index 3 or higher, which are less impactful.\n3.  Since revealing the deepest card is generally the best strategy when unsure, moving the 2♦ from column H (index 7) to column I (onto the 3♦) is the optimal choice. This uncovers the card at H[7].\n\nAnswer: (H,7,I)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards and build sequences. Moving the 8♦ from column B to the 9♦ in column D (B,9,D) achieves a high-priority objective: it uncovers the card at B,9, which is a K♥. Uncovering Kings is crucial as they are needed to start full sequences and can only be moved to empty columns later. This move also consolidates the diamond suit slightly. While other moves uncover cards, revealing a King is generally the most impactful immediate action.\n\nAnswer: (B,9,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  Moving the 5♦ from column D onto the 6♦ in column A (D,8,A) builds a same-suit sequence (6♦-5♦).\n2.  This move reveals the card at D[7], which is 9♦.\n3.  This revealed 9♦ allows the 8♦ from column B (index 9) to be moved onto it in a subsequent step (B,9,D).\n4.  Moving the 8♦ from B will reveal the card at B[8] (A♠).\n5.  This sequence of moves has a good chance of uncovering multiple hidden cards and building longer sequences compared to other available moves like (A,11,H), (H,8,B), or (I,9,F).\n\nAnswer: (D,8,A)","Reasoning: The goal is to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. There are no more 'hit' actions available. Several moves are possible:\n- (D,5,J): 2♥ onto 3♥ (uncovers D4: 2♥)\n- (E,5,F): 7♣ onto 8♣ (uncovers E4: 2♣)\n- (H,5,B): 4♥ onto 5♥ (uncovers H4: 3♣)\n- (I,5,B): Q♥ onto K♥ (uncovers I4: 9♥)\n- (J,5,B): Q♥ onto K♥ (uncovers J4: 8♥)\n\nMoves (I,5,B) and (J,5,B) both build a K♥-Q♥ sequence in column B. Comparing them:\n- (I,5,B) uncovers 9♥ at I4. The next move could be (J,4,I) moving 8♥ onto 9♥, uncovering J3 (XX).\n- (J,5,B) uncovers 8♥ at J4. The next move could be (A,10,J) moving 7♥ onto 8♥, uncovering A11 (6♦). This creates a longer sequence (9♥-8♥-7♥ in column J) and uncovers a specific card (6♦), making it slightly preferable.\n\nAnswer: (J,5,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  Analyze available moves: Several single-card and run moves are possible.\n2.  Evaluate moves based on cards revealed and sequence building potential.\n    *   Moving 6♦ from A to H (A,11,H) reveals A[10]=7♥. This enables a potential follow-up sequence: (I,8,F) reveals I[7]=Q♦, then (I,7,G) reveals G[3]=6♥, then (G,3,A) reveals G[2]. This chain opens 4 hidden cards (A[10], I[7], G[3], G[2]).\n    *   Moving 3♦-2♦ from F to I (F,9,I) reveals F[8]=8♣. This leads to a potential sequence: (F,8,A) reveals F[7]=4♣, then (F,7,G) reveals F[6]=10♣. This chain opens 3 hidden cards (F[8], F[7], F[6]).\n    *   Moving 3♣ from J to F (J,11,F) reveals J[10]=4♣. This leads to a potential sequence: (J,10,G) reveals J[9]=2♦, then (J,9,I) reveals J[8]=3♦. This chain opens 3 hidden cards (J[10], J[9], J[8]).\n3.  Compare options: The sequence starting with (A,11,H) opens the most cards (4) and utilizes the revealed card (7♥) to open a card high up in column G. This appears to be the most promising strategy.\n\nAnswer: (A,11,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify possible moves:\n    *   (A,6,J): Move Q♣ onto K♣. Reveals A6 (currently 7♦). Builds Q♣-K♣.\n    *   (E,9,G): Move J♠ onto Q♠. Reveals E8 (currently 9♥). Builds J♠-Q♠.\n    *   (H,9,F): Move 2♦ onto 3♦. Reveals H8 (currently 7♦). Builds 2♦-3♦.\n    *   (F,7,G): Move 4♣ onto 5♣. Reveals F7 (currently 8♣). Builds 4♣-5♣.\n2.  Evaluate follow-up potential:\n    *   After (A,6,J), reveals 7♦(A6). No immediate same-suit placement for 6♦(A10). Other moves ((E,9,G), (H,9,F), (F,7,G)) remain possible.\n    *   After (E,9,G), reveals 9♥(E8). Enables move (J,4,E) - move 8♥ onto 9♥.

Enables move (C,6,F) - move 7♣ onto 8♣. This reveals C5(3♠).\n3.  Choose the best option: Moves (E,9,G), (H,9,F), and (F,7,G) all enable an immediate second move that reveals another card. The sequence starting with (E,9,G) leads to revealing J3 (a hidden card high up in column J), which is generally slightly better than revealing known card types deeper in other columns (A10 or C5). Building the J♠-Q♠ sequence is also useful.\n\nAnswer: (E,9,G)","Reasoning: Moving the Q♦ from column I (index 7) to the K♦ in column G (index 4) achieves two important things:\n1.  It reveals the card underneath the Q♦ in column I (which is 3♦ at index 8). Revealing hidden cards is crucial.\n2.  It places the Q♦ onto the K♦ of the same suit, starting to build a valuable K♦ -> Q♦ sequence.\n3.  The revealed 3♦ may immediately allow another move, such as moving the 2♦ from column J (index 9) or G (index 10) onto it.\n\nAnswer: (I,7,G)","Reasoning: The best move is to consolidate the Club sequence. Moving the run 6♣, 5♣, 4♣, 3♣ from column G onto the 7♣ in column E achieves this. This creates a 5-card sequence (7♣ to 3♣) in column E and reveals the card at index 5 in column G (which is 4♥), potentially enabling further moves. Building sequences is a high priority, especially late in the game with no hits remaining.\n\nAnswer: (G,6,E)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards to reveal more potential moves.\n2.  Building same-suit sequences is also important.\n3.

This moves the single card 2♣ onto 3♣, forming a sequence and uncovering the card at E, index 3. This is a good move as it uncovers a hidden card.\n    *   Moving 4♣ (F,7) to 5♣ (G,10): No, 5♣ is not the top card of G.\n    *   Moving 6♣ (G,8) to 7♣ (E,5): No, 7♣ is not the top card of E.\n    *   Moving 3♥ (J,7) to 4♥ (H,5): Yes, 4♥ is the top card of H. This moves the single card 3♥ onto 4♥, forming a sequence and uncovering the card at J, index 6 (which is K♣). This is also a valid move, but uncovering a hidden card (like in the previous option) is generally preferred over uncovering an already face-up card.\n5.  Comparing (E,4,G) and (J,7,H): (E,4,G) uncovers a hidden card ('XX'), providing new information, while (J,7,H) uncovers K♣ which is already visible below 3♥. Therefore, (E,4,G) is strategically better.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  **Analyze Options:**\n    *   Moving 8♦ (B) reveals K♥.

Moving Q♦-3♦ (H,7) to K♦ (G,4) reveals 6♠ in H and builds K♦-Q♦-3♦.\n7.  Moving 6♣-5♣-4♣ (G,8) to 7♣ (C,6) reveals 4♥ in G and builds a 4-card sequence 7♣-6♣-5♣-4♣. This seems like the most productive move as it builds the longest sequence among the immediate options and reveals a card.\n\nComparing (H,7,G) and (G,8,C):\n- (H,7,G): Builds K♦-Q♦-3♦ (3 cards), reveals 6♠.\n- (G,8,C): Builds 7♣-6♣-5♣-4♣ (4 cards), reveals 4♥.\nBuilding the longer sequence seems slightly better.\n\nAnswer: (G,8,C)","Reasoning:\n1.  Check available moves: Several single-card moves are possible: (A,8,F), (B,8,C), (C,9,H), (D,8,A), (F,9,A), (G,8,C), (G,8,E), (H,8,B), (J,10,F), (J,10,I).\n2.  Evaluate moves based on potential reveals and sequence building.\n3.  Moving 2♣ from C[9] to H[8] (onto 3♣) - move (C,9,H) - reveals the card at C[8], which is 10♠.\n4.  This revealed 10♠ can then potentially be moved onto the J♠ at A[5] in the next turn. This sequence of two moves uncovers two hidden cards (C[8]=10♠, then C[7]=A♥).\n5.  Moving A♠ from B[8] to C[6] (onto 2♠) - move (B,8,C) - reveals B[7]=5♥. The next move could be moving the 2♠-A♠ run from C onto 3♠ at B[5], revealing C[6]=7♣ and consolidating a spade sequence.\n6.  Comparing the two paths: Path 1 starting with (C,9,H) reveals 10♠ and then A♥. Path 2 starting with (B,8,C) reveals 5♥ and then 7♣. Revealing the 10♠ which enables an immediate follow-up sequence move, and ultimately revealing an Ace, seems slightly preferable given the limited turns remaining.\n\nAnswer: (C,9,H)","Reasoning: It's the last turn (Epoch 99\/100), and no more hits are possible. The goal is to make any potentially useful move. Moving the 3♣ from column H onto the 4♣ in column G creates a 4-card same-suit sequence (6♣-5♣-4♣-3♣), consolidating cards and exposing the Q♣ underneath. This is one of the best available moves for sequence building in the current state.\nAnswer: (H,11,G)","Rationale: The game is at its final turn (Epoch 100\/100) and no more cards can be dealt ('hit' = 0). The goal is to make a move that completes a King-to-Ace sequence if possible. Checking the board, moving Q♥ from column I (index 5) onto the K♥ in column B (index 10) creates the start of a potential Heart sequence (K♥-Q♥). While this move won't complete the sequence or change the final score because the game ends immediately after, it represents the best strategic choice among the available options by consolidating cards of the same suit in sequence. Other moves like (J,5,B), (H,5,B), (D,5,J), or (E,5,F) are also valid but moving a Queen onto a King of the same suit is generally a higher priority move.\n\nAnswer: (I,5,B)"],"prompt":"\nYou are a Spider Solitaire expert.

This helps progress the game by building sequences and uncovering more playable cards.\nAnswer: (J,4,B)","Reasoning: The only valid move available is placing the 4♥ from column J onto the 5♥ in column B. This creates a sequence (5♥, 4♥) and reveals a hidden card in column J, which is a desirable outcome.\nAnswer: (J,4,B)","Reasoning: The goal is to build same-suit sequences. Moving the 4♥ (column J) onto the 5♥ (column B) creates a same-suit sequence (5♥, 4♥). This move also reveals a hidden card in column J, which is always beneficial. Other possible moves like J♦ onto Q♥ or Q♥ onto K♦ create mixed-suit sequences, which are less valuable. Moving 4♥ onto 5♠ or 5♣ also creates mixed-suit sequences.

Moving the K♦ from column E to the empty column J achieves both: it uncovers the card at index E,4 and makes column J available for sorting other sequences or temporarily holding cards. While moving the 4♥ from I to B also uncovers a card and builds a small sequence, securing an empty column early is generally more advantageous for long-term flexibility.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,J)","Reasoning: The only valid move is to place the 4♥ (from column J) onto the 5♥ (in column B).

Move the 10♦ from column A onto the J♦ in column E. This creates a J♦-10♦ sequence and reveals a card in column A.\n2. Move the 4♥ from column J onto the 5♥ in column B. This creates a 5♥-4♥ sequence and reveals a card in column J.\n\nBoth moves create a two-card same-suit sequence and reveal a hidden card. Neither move immediately opens up significantly better subsequent moves based on the visible cards. Revealing hidden cards is generally good. Let's choose the first option.\n\nAnswer: (A,5,E)","Reasoning: The only available move is placing the 4♥ from column J onto the 5♥ in column B. This continues a same-suit sequence and will reveal a new card in column J. There are no other valid moves, and no 'hit' actions are available.\nAnswer: (J,4,B)","Reasoning:\nThe main goal with no more cards to deal is to uncover hidden cards and build sequences.\n1.  Moving 4♥ from column H onto 5♥ in column B (H,4,B) achieves two things: it reveals a hidden card in column H and it builds a small same-suit sequence (5♥-4♥).\n2.  Moving A♠ from D to an empty column (e.g., D,6,I) would reveal K♦ in column D, but uses an empty column for an Ace, which might be better used for rearranging larger sequences.\n3.  Moving A♣ from F to an empty column (e.g., F,4,I) reveals a card in F but also uses an empty column for an Ace.\nBuilding a sequence while revealing a card without immediately consuming an empty column seems like the most constructive move.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,B)","Reasoning: Moving the King (K♦) from column B to an empty column (like G) is strategically sound. It clears the card underneath the King in column B, potentially revealing a useful card. Kings in empty columns are also easier to build sequences on, as they don't block other plays. While moving the 4♥ onto the 5♥ is possible, it creates a mixed-suit sequence on the King, which can be problematic later. Using an empty column for the King is generally a better long-term strategy.\nAnswer: (B,4,G)","Reasoning: The goal is to uncover hidden cards and build sequences. There are two possible moves: (A,4,D) moving 10♦ onto J♦, and (J,4,B) moving 4♥ onto 5♥. Both uncover a hidden card. Moving the 4♥ onto the 5♥ creates a 5♥-4♥ sequence, which is slightly better than the J♦-10♦ sequence as it involves lower cards, potentially allowing more flexibility later.\nAnswer: (J,4,B)","Reasoning: Moving the K♦ from column B to an empty column (like G) is a good strategic move. It reveals the hidden card below the K♦ in column B and utilizes an empty column, which is often crucial for maneuvering other cards later or starting a full K->A sequence.\nAnswer: (B,4,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards or build sequences.\n2.  There are four empty columns (G, H, I, J) available.\n3.  Moving a card to an empty column uncovers the card beneath it (if any).\n4.  Moving Q♥ from column E (E,4) to an empty column (e.g., G) will uncover the hidden card at E3.\n5.  Moving 4♥ from column F (F,4) to an empty column (e.g., G) will uncover the hidden card at F3.\n6.  Moving 4♥ from F (F,4) to 5♥ on B (B,5) would create a 5♥-4♥ sequence, but wouldn't uncover a card immediately.\n7.  Moving other bottom cards (10♦, 5♥, 5♠, A♠) to an empty column would uncover the face-down card directly above them (J♦, K♦, 5♣, A♣ respectively).\n8.  Uncovering a truly hidden card (XX) is generally preferred over uncovering a known face-down card or just building a short sequence without uncovering anything. Moving Q♥ (E,4) or 4♥ (F,4) achieves this. Moving Q♥ (E,4) to an empty column is a good standard move.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,G)","Reasoning: The move (A, 4, B) places the J♦-10♦ sequence onto the K♦, creating a 3-card same-suit sequence (K♦-J♦-10♦).

Using an empty column just to uncover a card is less preferable when a sequence-building move is available.\nAnswer: (F,5,B)","Reasoning: Moving the 4♥ onto the 5♥ creates a same-suit sequence (5♥, 4♥), which is generally more beneficial than creating mixed-suit sequences. This move also uncovers a hidden card in column J.\nAnswer: (J,4,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Empty columns are also valuable.\n2.  **Analyze Moves:**\n    *   Moving single face cards (Q♥, 4♥, 10♦, 5♥, 5♠, A♠) to empty columns is possible and reveals a card if the card moved is the only face-up card in its column (Q♥ in E, 4♥ in F).\n    *   Moving the J♦ 10♦ run from A to an empty column reveals a card in A.\n    *   Moving 4♥ from F to 5♥ in B (F, 4, B) is possible because 4♥ is one rank lower than 5♥ and they share the same suit. This move reveals a hidden card in column F and builds a same-suit sequence (5♥ 4♥) in column B.\n    *   Moving 4♥ from F to 5♠ in C (F, 4, C) is possible but less desirable as it creates a mixed-suit sequence, potentially blocking future moves with the 5♠. It also reveals a card in F.\n    *   Moving J♦ 10♦ from A onto K♦ in B is not possible because 5♥ is on top of K♦.\n3.  **Compare Options:**\n    *   (F, 4, B) reveals a card *and* builds a same-suit sequence.\n    *   (E, 4, G) reveals a card and uses an empty column.\n    *   (F, 4, G) reveals a card and uses an empty column.\n    *   (A, 4, G) reveals a card and uses an empty column.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Move (F, 4, B) is the best option as it achieves two key objectives simultaneously: revealing a hidden card and progressing a same-suit sequence.\n\nAnswer: (F,4,B)","Reasoning: Moving the King of Diamonds (K♦) from column E to the empty column J is a strong strategic move. It achieves two key objectives: it utilizes the valuable empty column (which only Kings can initiate filling otherwise) and it flips over the hidden card underneath the K♦ in column E, potentially opening up new plays.

Moving a King to an empty column is a strong strategic move, as it opens up the King's original column (I) for other builds and dedicates the empty column (J) to building the K♠ sequence down to Ace.\n3.  Moving K♠ from column I to column J (I,4,J) achieves this and reveals the hidden card at I,3.\n4.  Other possible moves involve creating smaller same-suit sequences (like D,5,A or B,5,G) or building the K♠, J♠ sequence in place (H,4,I). While these reveal cards and build sequences, freeing up column I and utilizing the empty column J with the K♠ provides more long-term flexibility and potential.\n\nAnswer: (I,4,J)","Reasoning: The goal is to build K->A sequences. Moving the J♠ onto the K♠ starts building a potential sequence of the highest rank and exposes a hidden card in column I. This is generally a good strategy.

Moving 9♥ (F,4) onto 10♥ (E,4) creates a 10♥-9♥ sequence in column E. This adheres to the same-suit rule and progresses towards building a full sequence.\n2.  This move also reveals the hidden card at F[3]. Revealing hidden cards is crucial for finding more potential moves.\n3.  Other possible same-suit moves like (B,5,H) or (D,5,A) are also good, but (F,4,E) is a valid and beneficial choice. There are no hits available.\n\nAnswer: (F,4,E)","Reasoning: The goal is to build K->A sequences. Moving the 9♣ from column B onto the 10♣ in column G creates a 10♣-9♣ same-suit sequence, which is direct progress towards a full sequence. This move also uncovers the hidden card at B4, potentially revealing new opportunities. While moving the K♠ to the empty column J is a valid strategy, building sequences when possible is generally preferred.\nAnswer: (B,5,G)","Reasoning: Moving the J♠ from column I onto the K♠ in column J creates a K♠-J♠ sequence, which is the start of a potential full sequence removal. This move also uncovers a hidden card in column I, which is essential for progressing the game, especially since no more cards can be dealt.\nAnswer: (I,4,J)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Moving the 9♣ from column B onto the 10♣ in column G accomplishes both. It creates a same-suit run (10♣-9♣) and exposes the hidden card at B[4]. This is generally preferable to moves that don't build same-suit sequences or moves that add to already complex columns.\nAnswer: (B,5,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Identify potential moves:** Several moves are possible:\n    *   (B,5,G): Move 9♣ onto 10♣ (same suit) -> Reveals card in B.\n    *   (E,4,D): Move 9♥ onto 10♥ (same suit) -> Reveals card in E.\n    *   (H,4,J): Move J♠ to empty column J -> Reveals card in H.\n    *   (I,4,J): Move K♠ to empty column J -> Reveals card in I.\n2.  **Evaluate moves:**\n    *   Building same-suit sequences ((B,5,G), (E,4,D)) is good.\n    *   Revealing hidden cards is crucial. All listed moves achieve this.\n    *   Moving cards to empty columns is useful, especially Kings, as they can only move to empty columns.\n3.  **Prioritize:** Moving the King (K♠) to the empty column J (I,4,J) is generally a strong strategic move. It places the King in its only possible destination type (empty column), frees up space below it in column I, and reveals a hidden card. While building same-suit sequences is also beneficial, managing Kings and empty columns is often key.\n\nAnswer: (I,4,J)","Reasoning: Moving the 9♥ from column F onto the 10♥ in column E creates a same-suit sequence (10♥-9♥). This action progresses towards building a full sequence and reveals a hidden card in column F, which is crucial for uncovering more potential moves.\nAnswer: (F,4,E)","Reasoning: Moving the K♠ from column I to the empty column J is a standard strategic move.

Revealing hidden cards is essential for making progress.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,I)","Reasoning: Moving the King (K♠) from column H to an empty column (I or J) is strategically valuable. It reveals the hidden card underneath in column H and makes the empty column available for building sequences starting with a King, or for temporary storage to rearrange other columns. Using an empty column is a high-priority action in Spider Solitaire, especially when no hits are left.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,I)","Reasoning: The goal is to build sequences from King down to Ace in the same suit. Moving the J♠ (column G) onto the K♠ (column H) creates a K♠-J♠ sequence, which is a direct step towards completing a full sequence. This move also reveals the hidden card underneath the J♠ in column G, which is essential for progressing the game, especially since no more cards can be dealt.

Only the bottom card of each column is face‑up; hidden cards are shown as 'XX'.  \n2. After you move a face‑up run away, the new bottom card flips face‑up automatically.  \n3. Completing a full K→A same‑suit sequence in any column removes those 13 cards immediately and awards +1 point.  \n\n### Columns & Format\n- Columns are labeled A–J (indices 0–9).  \n- Always output exactly:  'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER',e.g.'Answer: (A,4,B)' means move cards from column A starting at index 4 to column B.\n\n\nCurrent Game Board:\n  A B C D E F G H I J\n  -------------------\n0 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX\n1 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX\n2 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX\n3 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX\n4 XX XX XX XX 4♥ 10♣ J♦ 4♦ 5♥ 8♥\n5 Q♦ 9♠ 9♦ 4♠                  \nEpoch: 101\/100\nThe remaining chances of 'hit': 0\n\n","have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Moving Q♦ onto K♦ (H, 4, G) reveals a card in H and starts building a sequence on a King (K♦ Q♦). This is strategically strong because Kings cannot be moved onto other cards.\n4.  This move also enables a subsequent move of J♦ (B, 5) onto the newly placed Q♦ in column G, which would reveal another card (in B) and extend the sequence to K♦ Q♦ J♦.\n5.  Moving 9♣ onto 10♣ (J, 4, A) is also good as it reveals a card and builds 10♣ 9♣, potentially allowing 8♣ to join later.

Moving Q♦ to K♦ reveals a card but creates a mixed-suit sequence which can be less flexible.\nAnswer: (I,4,J)","Reasoning: There are four possible moves that build same-suit sequences and expose a hidden card: (B,5,H), (H,5,G), (I,5,J), and (J,5,A). Moving the Q♦ from column H onto the K♦ in column G starts building a sequence from the highest possible rank (King) and uncovers a card in column H. This is generally a good strategic move.\n\nAnswer: (H,5,G)","Reasoning: Moving the 9♣ from column J onto the 10♣ in column A reveals a new card in column J and creates a same-suit sequence (10♣, 9♣). Building same-suit sequences is a key strategy in Spider Solitaire.\nAnswer: (J,4,A)","Reasoning: Several moves are possible that uncover a hidden card. Specifically, moves (B, 5, H), (H, 4, G), (I, 4, J), and (J, 4, A) all uncover a card *and* create a same-suit sequence of length 2, which adheres to the strict movement rule provided (\"descending, same-suit run onto a column whose top card is exactly one rank higher\"). Among these options, moving the Q♦ onto the K♦ (H, 4, G) is strategically best because it starts building a sequence on the highest possible rank (King), directly working towards the goal of creating a full K-A sequence. This move also uncovers a hidden card in column H.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,G)","Reasoning: Moving the Jack of Diamonds (J♦) from column B onto the Queen of Diamonds (Q♦) in column H creates a longer sequence (K♦-Q♦-J♦) by utilizing the King of Diamonds (K♦) already in column G.

Moving Q♦ onto K♦ (H, 4, G) starts building a sequence on a King, which is generally a good strategy as Kings can only move to empty columns. This move also reveals a hidden card in column H.\n4.  This move (H, 4, G) immediately creates a K♦-Q♦ run, setting up a potential subsequent move of J♦ (B) onto this run (B, 5, G), which would further build the sequence and reveal another card (in B).\n5.  Consolidating the clubs ((I, 4, J) or (J, 4, A)) is also a good option, but starting the K♦ sequence seems slightly more strategically sound at this stage.\n6.

Additionally, this move creates a same-suit sequence (10♣-9♣), which is helpful for potentially building a full sequence later, for example by moving the 8♣ from column I onto it.\nAnswer: (J, 5, A)","Reasoning: Moving the Q♦ onto the K♦ progresses towards building a sequence on the King and reveals a hidden card in column H. This could potentially allow the J♦ from column B to be moved onto the Q♦ afterwards.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,G)","Reasoning: Several moves are possible that build same-suit sequences and reveal a hidden card:\n1.  (H, 4, G): Move Q♦ onto K♦. Builds K♦-Q♦ sequence, reveals card in H.\n2.  (I, 4, J): Move 8♣ onto 9♣. Builds 9♣-8♣ sequence, reveals card in I.\n3.  (J, 4, A): Move 9♣ onto 10♣. Builds 10♣-9♣ sequence, reveals card in J.\n\nMoving onto a King is generally a strong move as it starts building a sequence from the top. This move (H, 4, G) achieves that and reveals a new card.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,G)","Reasoning: The best moves are those that reveal hidden cards or consolidate same-suit sequences.\n1.  (I, 4, J): Move 8♣ onto 9♣. This creates a 9♣-8♣ sequence and reveals the card at I,3. This is good because it creates a sequence and reveals a card.\n2.  (J, 4, A): Move 9♣ onto 10♣. This creates a 10♣-9♣ sequence and reveals the card at J,3. This is also good for the same reasons.\n3.  (H, 4, G): Move Q♦ onto K♦. This creates a K♦-Q♦ sequence and reveals the card at H,3. Good as well.\n4.  (B, 5, H): Move J♦ onto Q♦. Creates J♦-Q♦ sequence but does not reveal a card as B is empty below. Less preferable.\n\nComparing (I, 4, J) and (J, 4, A): If we do (I, 4, J), we create 9♣-8♣ at J. The next move could be (J, 4, A) moving 9♣-8♣ onto 10♣, creating 10♣-9♣-8♣ at A and revealing another card at J,3. This sequence reveals two cards and builds a 3-card run in two moves. Starting with (J, 4, A) leads to a similar outcome. I choose (I, 4, J) as the first step in building the club sequence.\n\nAnswer: (I,4,J)","Reasoning: Moving the Q♦ from column H onto the K♦ in column G builds a same-suit sequence starting from the King, which is a primary goal. This move also reveals a hidden card in column H, potentially opening up further plays. Other possible moves like (B,5,H), (I,5,J), or (J,5,A) also reveal cards and build sequences, but starting the K♦ sequence seems slightly more advantageous. There are no 'hit' chances left.\n\nAnswer: (H,5,G)","Reasoning: Moving the Q♦ from column H onto the K♦ in column G progresses towards building a full sequence starting with a King. This move also reveals a hidden card in column H, which could open up further plays. Other available moves, like moving the 9♣ onto the 10♣ or the 8♣ onto the 9♣, also reveal cards but building onto the King is generally the preferred strategy.\nAnswer: (H,5,G)","Reasoning: Several moves are possible that build same-suit sequences and reveal a hidden card.\n1.  (A,5,C): Move 10♣ onto Q♣. Reveals A,4. Creates Q♣-10♣.\n2.  (B,5,H): Move J♦ onto Q♦. Reveals B,4. Creates Q♦-J♦.\n3.  (H,4,G): Move Q♦ onto K♦. Reveals H,3. Creates K♦-Q♦.\n4.  (I,4,J): Move 8♣ onto 9♣. Reveals I,3. Creates 9♣-8♣.\n5.  (J,4,A): Move 9♣ onto 10♣. Reveals J,3. Creates 10♣-9♣.\n\nMoves (I,4,J) and (J,4,A) can lead to consolidating the club cards (8♣, 9♣, 10♣, Q♣) into a single sequence Q♣-10♣-9♣-8♣, revealing three cards (I,3, J,3, A,4) in the process. Moves (H,4,G) and (B,5,H) lead to building K♦-Q♦-J♦, revealing two cards (H,3, B,4). Consolidating the clubs reveals more cards. Let's start by moving the 8♣ onto the 9♣.\n\nAnswer: (I,4,J)","Reasoning: There are three possible moves: (H,4,G) moving Q♦ onto K♦, (I,4,J) moving 8♣ onto 9♣, and (J,4,A) moving 9♣ onto 10♣. Both (I,4,J) and (J,4,A) allow for a subsequent move to consolidate the 10♣, 9♣, and 8♣ into a single sequence (10♣-9♣-8♣). This consolidation would reveal two hidden cards (one from column I, one from column J) over two moves. The move (H,4,G) only reveals one hidden card in column H. Revealing more hidden cards is generally better, especially with limited turns remaining. Starting the club consolidation with (J,4,A) seems like a good first step.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,A)","Reasoning: There are several possible moves that build same-suit sequences: (I, 4, J), (J, 4, A), and (H, 4, G). Moving the Q♦ onto the K♦ (H, 4, G) starts building a sequence from the highest card and reveals a card in column H, which is a standard beneficial strategy. Other moves like (I, 4, J) or (J, 4, A) are also good as they build same-suit sequences and reveal cards. Without knowing the hidden cards, starting the King sequence is often prioritized.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences, preferably starting from Kings.\n2.  Several moves are possible: (B,4,G), (H,4,G), (I,4,J), (J,4,A).\n3.  Moving Q♦ (H,4) onto K♦ (G,4) reveals a card in column H and starts building a sequence K♦ Q♦. This seems promising as it builds on a King.\n4.  Moving J♦ (B,4) onto the newly formed K♦ Q♦ sequence in column G would then be possible, revealing a card in column B and extending the sequence to K♦ Q♦ J♦.\n5.  Alternatively, moving 9♣ (J,4) onto 10♣ (A,4) reveals a card in J, and moving 8♣ (I,4) onto the new 10♣ 9♣ sequence reveals a card in I. This creates 10♣ 9♣ 8♣.\n6.  Building on the King (Option 3 & 4) is generally a higher priority strategy. Moving Q♦ first allows the subsequent move of J♦ onto the same stack.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,G)","Reasoning: There are several possible moves: (B,4,H), (H,4,G), (I,4,J), and (J,4,A). All these moves uncover one hidden card. However, moves (I,4,J) and (J,4,A) create same-suit runs, which is generally preferable for building towards a completed K->A sequence. Moving 8♣ from column I onto 9♣ in column J creates a 9♣-8♣ run and reveals a card in column I. This also prepares for potentially moving the 9♣-8♣ run onto the 10♣ in column A later.\n\nAnswer: (I,4,J)","Reasoning: There are three possible moves that consolidate same-suit pairs and reveal a hidden card: (H,4,G) moving Q♦ onto K♦, (I,4,J) moving 8♣ onto 9♣, and (J,4,A) moving 9♣ onto 10♣. All are beneficial. Moving the Q♦ onto the K♦ builds the sequence from the top down and reveals a card in column H.\nAnswer: (H,4,G)","Reasoning: The primary goal with limited turns and no more 'hit' options is to reveal hidden cards and consolidate sequences. Moving the Q♦ (H,4) onto the K♦ (G,4) is a valid move because they are the same suit (Diamonds) and Q is one rank lower than K. This move accomplishes two things: 1) It starts building a sequence from the King downwards (K♦-Q♦). 2) It reveals the hidden card underneath the Q♦ in column H. This is generally a good strategy to uncover more potential moves.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,G)","Reasoning: Moving the 9♣ from column J to the 10♣ in column A creates a same-suit sequence (10♣, 9♣). This action reveals a hidden card in column J and also sets up a potential subsequent move for the 8♣ in column I onto the 9♣ in column A, which would further consolidate the Club suit and reveal another hidden card. Building sequences and revealing cards are the primary objectives.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,A)","Reasoning: Moving the Q♦ (H,4) onto the K♦ (G) starts building a potential sequence from the King downwards, which is a primary goal. This move also reveals a hidden card in column H.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,G)","Reasoning: We are at epoch 98 out of 100, meaning only two moves remain. We cannot deal new cards. The best strategy is to create the longest possible same-suit sequence and reveal hidden cards.\nWe can observe 10♣ (A,5), 9♣ (J,4), and 8♣ (I,4).\nWe also see K♦ (G,4) and Q♦ (H,4).\nOption 1: Move Q♦ onto K♦ via (H,4,G). This creates K♦-Q♦ and reveals one card (H,3). We would have one move left.\nOption 2: Combine the clubs. Move 8♣ onto 9♣ via (I,4,J). This creates 9♣-8♣ and reveals one card (I,3). The next move can be (J,4,A) to move 9♣-8♣ onto 10♣, creating 10♣-9♣-8♣ and revealing another card (J,3). This takes two moves total.\nOption 3: Combine the clubs differently. Move 9♣ onto 10♣ via (J,4,A). This creates 10♣-9♣ and reveals one card (J,3). The next move can be (I,4,A) to move 8♣ onto 10♣-9♣, creating 10♣-9♣-8♣ and revealing another card (I,3). This also takes two moves total.\n\nSince options 2 and 3 utilize both remaining moves to build the longest possible sequence (3 cards) and reveal two hidden cards, they are preferable to option 1 which only builds a 2-card sequence and reveals one card in the first move, leaving the potential of the second move unknown. Between options 2 and 3, the outcome after two moves is identical. We'll choose to start with moving the 8♣.\n\nAnswer: (I,4,J)","Okay, let's analyze the board.\n\n1.  **Move 9♣ (J, 5, A):** Move 9♣ onto 10♣. This creates a same-suit sequence 10♣-9♣ and reveals a card in column J.\n2.  **Move Q♦ (H, 4, G):** Move Q♦ onto K♦. This creates a same-suit sequence K♦-Q♦ and reveals a card in column H.\n3.  **Move 8♣ (I, 4, J):** Move 8♣ onto 9♣. This creates a same-suit sequence 9♣-8♣ and reveals a card in column I.\n\nAll three moves are valid and reveal a hidden card. Since this is the last epoch (99\/100) and no sequences are near completion, any move that reveals a card is equally good. Building onto the King (K♦) is often a good heuristic, so let's choose that.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,G)","Reasoning: The goal is to create descending sequences of the same suit. The 8♣ in column I can be moved onto the 9♣ in column J, creating a same-suit sequence (9♣, 8♣). This also exposes a hidden card in column I. Although the game ends after this epoch, making a same-suit connection is generally the preferred strategy when available. Another possible move is (H,4,G), moving Q♦ onto K♦, but this creates a mixed-suit sequence. Moving the 8♣ is slightly better as it forms a same-suit run.\n\nAnswer: (I,4,J)"],"prompt":"\nYou are a Spider Solitaire expert.

No card can be placed onto another card of the next higher rank, regardless of suit. All columns are occupied, so dealing new cards is possible.\n\nAnswer: hit","Reasoning: The best strategic moves early in Spider Solitaire often involve uncovering hidden cards and creating empty columns. Moving the King of Clubs (K♣) from column J to the empty column G achieves both of these goals. It reveals the card at J(5) (which is Q♥) and provides a valuable empty column (G) that can be used for rearranging other sequences later. While other moves like (B,6,C) build small same-suit sequences, creating an empty column offers more flexibility at this stage.\n\nAnswer: (J,6,G)","Reasoning: Moving the 2♠ from column B onto the 3♠ in column C achieves two goals: it reveals a hidden card in column B (at index 5) and it consolidates cards of the same suit (3♠-2♠) which helps towards building a full sequence.\nAnswer: (B,6,C)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify possible moves:\n    *   Q♣ (A6) can move onto K♣ (D6) or K♣ (J6). This builds a K♣-Q♣ sequence and reveals 7♦ in A.\n    *   2♠ (B6) can move onto 3♠ (C5). This builds a 3♠-2♠ sequence and reveals A♠ in B.\n    *   No other single cards can move onto the bottom card of another column to form a same-suit sequence or onto a card one rank higher.\n    *   No same-suit runs can be moved.\n\n2.  Evaluate the moves:\n    *   Moving Q♣ builds a sequence starting with K, which is good, but reveals a 7♦.\n    *   Moving 2♠ builds a shorter sequence but reveals an A♠. Revealing cards is crucial, and revealing an Ace is generally very beneficial as it's the final card needed for a sequence and can unblock other plays later. Building same-suit sequences, even short ones, is also a primary objective.\n\n3.  Conclusion: Moving 2♠ onto 3♠ (B,6,C) seems slightly better because it reveals an Ace, which is often more valuable than revealing a mid-rank card like 7♦, and it still builds a same-suit sequence.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,C)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to build same-suit sequences from King down to Ace. The secondary goal is to reveal hidden cards.\n1.  Moving A♠ from column B onto 2♠ in column C (B,8,C) creates a three-card same-suit sequence (3♠, 2♠, A♠) in column C. This is beneficial for potentially completing a spade sequence later.\n2.  This move also reveals the card at index 7 in column B.\n3.  Other moves like (H,5,B) or (A,6,D\/J) create shorter two-card sequences.\n4.  Move (E,4,I) reveals a hidden card but moves a mixed-suit stack (2♣, 7♣, 5♠) onto 3♣, potentially blocking progress on the club suit in column I later.\nTherefore, consolidating the spade sequence is the most productive move.\n\nAnswer: (B,8,C)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify possible moves: Examine the bottom card of each column and see if it can move onto the bottom card of another column (must be one rank higher). Also check if any existing face-up runs can move.\n    *   A[7] 7♦ can move to I[6] 8♥. (A,7,I). Reveals A[6] Q♣.\n    *   C[7] A♥ can move to D[4] 2♥. (C,7,D). Reveals C[6] 7♣.\n    *   D[5] 9♦ can move to F[6] 10♣. (D,5,F). Reveals D[4] 2♥.\n    *   G[5] Q♠ can move to E[6] K♣. (G,5,E). Reveals G[4] K♦.\n    *   G[5] Q♠ can move to J[6] K♣. (G,5,J). Reveals G[4] K♦.\n2.  Evaluate moves:\n    *   (A,7,I): Moves 7♦ onto 8♥ (out of suit). Reveals Q♣. Okay, but doesn't build suit sequence.\n    *   (C,7,D): Moves A♥ onto 2♥ (same suit). Reveals 7♣. Good - builds a sequence.\n    *   (D,5,F): Moves 9♦ onto 10♣ (out of suit). Reveals 2♥. Less good - out of suit, reveals low card.\n    *   (G,5,E) \/ (G,5,J): Moves Q♠ onto K♣ (out of suit). Uncovers K♦ (which is already visible). Bad - blocks K♣, doesn't reveal hidden card.\n3.  Choose the best move: Moving A♥ onto 2♥ (C,7,D) is the best option as it builds a same-suit sequence, which is a primary goal in Spider Solitaire, and reveals a potentially useful card (7♣).\n\nAnswer: (C,7,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify potential moves: Check which cards can be moved onto the bottom card of another column, or onto an empty column (none available). Also check if any same-suit runs can be moved.\n    *   A♥ (C,7) can move onto 2♥ (D,5). This reveals the card at C,6.\n    *   2♠ (B,6) can move onto 3♠ (C,5). This reveals the card at B,5.\n    *   4♥ (H,5) can move onto 5♥ (B,7). This reveals the card at H,4.\n2.  Evaluate the moves:\n    *   **(C,7,D):** Moving A♥ onto 2♥ reveals a hidden card (C,6) and creates a 2♥-A♥ sequence. This is generally good.\n    *   **(B,6,C):** Moving 2♠ onto 3♠ reveals a hidden card (B,5) and creates a 3♠-2♠ sequence. Also seems reasonable.\n    *   **(H,5,B):** Moving 4♥ onto 5♥ reveals a hidden card (H,4) and creates a 5♥-4♥ sequence. However, this increases the length of column B significantly and places a heart sequence on top of A♠, potentially hindering future spade sequence building in that column.\n3.  Choose the best move: Moving A♥ (C,7) to 2♥ (D,5) seems the most beneficial as it reveals a card without creating potential future blockages like the (H,5,B) move, and it completes the bottom of a heart sequence (2♥-A♥).\n\nAnswer: (C,7,D)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Moving the A♠ from column B to the 2♠ in column C achieves both: it reveals the card at B7 and creates a small Spade sequence (2♠, A♠). Column B is also the deepest column with 8 hidden cards, making revealing a card there potentially more valuable than revealing from shallower columns.\n\nAnswer: (B,8,C)","Reasoning: Moving the 2♠ from column B onto the 3♠ in column C creates a same-suit run (3♠ 2♠). This is beneficial for potentially building a full sequence later (e.g., if the A♠ becomes movable onto it). Crucially, this move also exposes the card currently hidden under the 2♠ in column B (the 5♥), which is essential for progressing the game since no more cards can be dealt ('hit' is 0).\n\nAnswer: (B,6,C)","Reasoning: The goal is to build same-suit sequences and reveal hidden cards. Moving the J♠ from column A (index 5) onto the Q♠ in column G (index 5) achieves both. It creates a Q♠-J♠ sequence and reveals the card at A,4. This also frees the Q♣ at A,6 for potential future moves. Other moves like (C,7,D) or (H,5,B) also reveal cards but either break sequences or create less optimal structures.\n\nAnswer: (A,5,G)","Reasoning: Moving the 5♥ from column B to the 6♥ in column D builds a same-suit sequence (6♥-5♥) and uncovers the card underneath (2♠) in column B. This revealed 2♠ can then potentially be moved onto the 3♠ in column C, continuing to uncover cards and build sequences. This appears more immediately productive than other available moves.\n\nAnswer: (B,7,D)","Reasoning: The goal is to reveal hidden cards, as there are no more cards to deal ('hit'). Several moves are possible that reveal a card:\n1.  (B,6,C): Move 2♠ (and cards below) onto 3♠. Reveals B5.\n2.  (C,7,D): Move A♥ onto 2♥. Reveals C6.\n3.  (E,4,H): Move 2♣ (and cards below) onto 3♣. Reveals E3.\n4.  (J,4,I): Move 8♥ (and cards below) onto 9♥. Reveals J3.\n\nAll these moves reveal one hidden card. Moving a single card is often preferable as it causes less disruption and potentially opens up more immediate options. Moving A♥ (C,7) onto 2♥ (D,5) achieves this.\n\nAnswer: (C,7,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goals are to reveal hidden cards and create empty columns to facilitate rearranging sequences.\n2.  There are no cards left to deal ('hit' chances = 0).\n3.  Column G is currently empty.\n4.  Moving K♣ from column J (index 6) to the empty column G (move (J,6,G)) achieves two important things:\n    *   It creates an empty column (Column G), which is strategically valuable. Kings are often moved to empty columns.\n    *   It reveals the card underneath the K♣ in column J (index 5), which is Q♥. Revealing hidden cards is crucial for progress.\n5.  Other moves like (H,6,G) also create an empty column, but moving the King seems slightly preferable here as it uncovers a higher-rank card (Q♥ vs 4♥) and removes a King from a potentially buildable pile.\n\nAnswer: (J,6,G)","Reasoning: The goal is to reveal hidden cards or create sequences. Several moves are possible. Moving 2♣ from column E onto 3♣ in column H (E, 4, H) reveals the hidden card at E[3]. This is generally a high-priority action. Other moves like (J, 4, I) also reveal a hidden card, but (E, 4, H) might enable a follow-up move (4♥ from H to 5♥ in B).\n\nAnswer: (E,4,H)","Reasoning: Moving the 5♥ from column B onto the 6♥ in column D reveals the Ace of Spades underneath in column B. Revealing Aces is generally a good strategy as they are the foundation for building sequences down to King. This move opens up possibilities without significantly blocking other potential plays immediately.\n\nAnswer: (B,5,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. There are no empty columns and no more 'hit' chances.\n2.  Several moves build same-suit sequences:\n    *   (B, 5, C): Moves 2♠ onto 3♠, reveals 3♠ (B,4). Creates 3♠-2♠.\n    *   (B, 6, D): Moves 5♥ onto 6♥, reveals 2♠ (B,5). Creates 6♥-5♥.\n    *   (C, 6, D): Moves A♥ onto 2♥, reveals 7♣ (C,5). Creates 2♥-A♥.\n3.  Comparing these:\n    *   (B, 6, D) reveals 2♠, which has an immediate follow-up move onto 3♠ (C,4). This allows revealing another card in column B quickly.\n    *   (B, 5, C) reveals 3♠, which has no immediate move.\n    *   (C, 6, D) reveals 7♣, which has no immediate move.\n4.  Therefore, moving the 5♥ from column B to column D is the best move as it builds a sequence and reveals a card (2♠) that enables another sequence-building move immediately after.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,D)","This move builds a same-suit sequence and reveals a card. Moving the A♥ from column C onto the 2♥ in column D creates a 2♥-A♥ run. This action also reveals the card at index 6 in column C (the 7♣). Building sequences and revealing hidden cards are key objectives.\n\nAnswer: (C,7,D)","*   **Reasoning:** The primary goal with no hits remaining is to uncover hidden cards and create playable sequences.\n    *   Moving the 2♣-7♣ run from column E onto the 3♣ in column H is possible because the 2♣ is one rank lower than the 3♣.\n    *   This move reveals the hidden card at index 3 in column E (E3). Uncovering hidden cards is crucial for making further progress.\n    *   Other potential moves like (B,8,C) or (J,4,I) build sequences or consolidate suits but do not reveal hidden cards. Revealing hidden cards generally offers more potential for future moves.\n\n*   **Move:** The run starts with 2♣ at index 4 in column E. It moves onto column H.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,H)","Reasoning: There are no available moves that build towards a same-suit sequence completion. The next best strategy is to uncover hidden cards. Moving the Q♥ from column J onto the K♦ in column G will reveal the card at index J[4]. This opens up possibilities in column J, which has 5 hidden cards.\nAnswer: (J,5,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  My primary goal is to reveal hidden cards to open up more possibilities.\n2.  I also want to build same-suit sequences where possible.\n3.  Dealing new cards ('hit') is not an option as there are no hits remaining.\n4.  Several moves can reveal hidden cards:\n    *   (B,6,C): Move 2♠ onto 3♠. Reveals 5♥ in B. Builds 3♠-2♠ run in C.\n    *   (B,7,F): Move 5♥ onto 6♥. Reveals A♠ in B.\n    *   (C,7,D): Move A♥ onto 2♥. Reveals 7♣ in C. Builds 2♥-A♥ run in D.\n    *   (H,6,B): Move 4♥ onto 5♥. Reveals J♦ in H.\n5.  Comparing these options, (B,6,C) seems best. It reveals the 5♥ in column B, which has an immediate potential destination (6♥ in column F). It also builds a small same-suit sequence (3♠-2♠) in column C.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,C)","Reasoning: The priority is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Moving the 2♠ from column B onto the 3♠ in column C accomplishes both: it reveals the A♠ in column B and extends the spade sequence in column C to 3♠-2♠-A♠. This is generally a strong type of move. Other moves might reveal cards or build sequences, but this one does both effectively.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,C)","Reasoning: Moving the 2♠ from column B onto the 3♠ in column C creates a same-suit sequence (3♠-2♠). This move also reveals the card underneath the 2♠ in column B (the 5♥), which could enable further moves, such as potentially moving the 5♥ onto the 6♥ in column F. Building same-suit sequences and uncovering hidden cards are primary goals.\nAnswer: (B,6,C)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to build same-suit sequences (K->A).\n2.  Moving 2♠ from column B onto 3♠ in column C directly builds a same-suit sequence (3♠-2♠).\n3.  This move also reveals the card underneath the 2♠ in column B (which is another 3♠). Revealing hidden cards is crucial.\n4.  Other moves, like moving Q♠ onto K♣, reveal cards (K♦) but create mixed-suit stacks on top of Kings, which can be problematic later. Moving A♥ onto 2♥ is decent but doesn't build upon an existing same-suit sequence start like the ♠ move does. Creating the 3♠-2♠ sequence seems the most strategically sound step towards building a full sequence.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,C)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify potential moves: Check which bottom cards or same-suit runs can be moved.\n    *   Q♣ (A6) can move to K♣ (D6). Move: (A,6,D). Reveals 7♦ (A7). Creates K♣-Q♣.\n    *   A♠ (B8) cannot move (needs a 2♠ at the bottom of another column).\n    *   The run 2♠-A♠ (B6-B8) can move onto 3♠ (C5). Move: (B,6,C). Reveals 5♥ (B7). Creates 3♠-2♠-A♠.\n    *   No other bottom cards or obvious runs can move.\n2.  Compare the two possible moves:\n    *   (A,6,D): Reveals 7♦. Creates a 2-card club sequence. The revealed 7♦ has no immediate move.\n    *   (B,6,C): Reveals 5♥. Creates a 3-card spade sequence. The revealed 5♥ (B7) can immediately move onto 6♥ (D3), which would reveal another card at B6.\n3.  Conclusion: Move (B,6,C) is superior as it builds a longer same-suit sequence and opens up an immediate follow-up move that reveals another card, which is generally a better strategy, especially with no 'hit' chances left.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,C)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Moving the A♠ from column B to the 2♠ in column C achieves both: it reveals the card at B[7] (which is 5♥) and creates a small same-suit sequence (2♠-A♠) in column C. This is generally preferable to moves that place cards of different suits together, as same-suit runs are required for completion and are easier to move later. Other moves reveal cards but don't build same-suit sequences immediately. Since hits are unavailable, making a constructive move like this is essential.\n\nAnswer: (B,8,C)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards to enable more moves and build sequences. Several moves reveal hidden cards: (B,7,E) reveals A♠, (C,7,D) reveals 7♣, (D,7,F) reveals K♣, (H,7,G) reveals 4♥, and (H,6,B) reveals J♦.\nMoving the J♦ from column H onto the Q♠ in column G (H,7,G) achieves two things: it reveals the card at H6 (which is 4♥) and it creates a two-card sequence (Q♠-J♦). The revealed 4♥ can potentially be moved onto the 5♥ in column B later. This looks like a constructive step.\n\nAnswer: (H,7,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards to find potential sequences.\n2.  Several moves consolidate same-suit runs: (B,6,C), (C,7,D), (E,4,H), (B,8,B), (A,6,D), (A,5,G), (H,5,B), (A,6,J).\n3.  Moves that reveal hidden cards are (E,4,H) [reveals E,3] and (A,5,G) [reveals A,4].\n4.  Moving J♠ from A,5 to Q♠ at G,5 (move (A,5,G)) reveals the card at A,4.\n5.  This move also positions the Q♣ at A,6 to potentially move onto K♣ at D,6 or J,6 in a subsequent step, which would reveal the card at A,5. This chain offers more potential reveals than (E,4,H).\n6.  Therefore, (A,5,G) is the most promising move.\n\nAnswer: (A,5,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to build sequences and reveal hidden cards.\n2.  There are no chances left to deal new cards ('hit').\n3.  Two primary moves are available:\n    *   Move A♥ from column C (index 7) onto 2♥ in column D (index 5). This reveals a card in C and creates a 2-card sequence (2♥ A♥).\n    *   Move 8♥ from column J (index 5) onto 9♥ in column I (index 4). This reveals a card in J and creates a 3-card sequence (Q♥ 9♥ 8♥) by attaching to the existing Q♥ in column I.\n4.  Building longer sequences is generally preferred. Revealing a card in column J (which has 5 hidden cards) is potentially more valuable than revealing one in column C (which has 4 hidden cards), although this is speculative. The longer sequence makes (J,5,I) slightly better.\n\nAnswer: (J,5,I)","Reasoning: The move (H,7,G) shifts the J♦ onto the Q♠. This creates a same-suit sequence (Q♠ J♦) in column G, which is a step towards building a full sequence. Furthermore, this move reveals the card underneath the J♦ in column H (the 4♥), increasing the number of available cards and potential future moves.\n\nAnswer: (H,7,G)","Reasoning: The best strategy is usually to uncover hidden cards or create empty columns. There are no empty columns, and no moves immediately create one. Several moves can uncover hidden cards. Moving A♥ from column C onto the 2♥ in column D uncovers the card at C(5) and creates a small same-suit sequence (2♥-A♥). Moving A♠ from column B onto the 2♠ in column B also uncovers a card (B(6)) and creates a same-suit sequence (2♠-A♠). Both moves reveal one card. Moving the Ace to a different column (C to D) slightly improves board organization by consolidating the hearts.\n\nAnswer: (C,6,D)","Reasoning: The best move is to free up a column by moving a King to the empty column G. There are two Kings available: K♣ at D,6 and K♣ at J,6. Moving the King from column J only moves the King itself and reveals the Q♥ underneath. Moving the King from D would also move the 7♣ and A♥ below it, revealing the 2♥. Moving just the King from J seems slightly simpler and reveals a Queen, which might be useful with the other Queens on the board (G,5 and I,5). Using an empty column for a King is a standard good strategy.\nAnswer: (J,6,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Reveal hidden cards to uncover potential plays and build sequences.\n2.  **Analyze Moves:** Several moves are possible that reveal a hidden card.\n    *   (A,6,D) or (A,6,J) moves Q♣ onto K♣, revealing J♠ in column A.\n    *   (B,6,C) moves 2♠ onto 3♠, revealing 3♠ in column B.\n    *   (C,6,J) moves 7♣ onto 8♥, revealing 3♠ in column C.\n    *   (E,6,F) moves 5♠ onto 6♥, revealing 7♣ in column E.\n    *   (F,6,A) moves 10♣ onto J♠, revealing 9♦ in column F.\n    *   (G,5,D) or (G,5,J) moves Q♠ onto K♣, revealing K♦ in column G. Revealing a King is less useful now as it requires an empty column.\n    *   (H,6,G), (H,6,I) or (H,6,J) moves J♦ onto Q♠\/Q♥, revealing 4♥ in column H.\n    *   (I,6,D) or (I,6,F) moves 8♥ onto 9♦, revealing Q♥ in column I.\n3.  **Choose Best Move:** Moving the J♦ from H reveals the 4♥. This seems like a good move as it uncovers a relatively low card which might be useful soon. Placing it on the Q♥ in column I (H,6,I) keeps the suits consistent within that stack for now, although it's not a same-suit move. Revealing 4♥ is preferable to revealing J♠, Q♥, or K♦ at this stage.\n\nAnswer: (H,6,I)","Reasoning: Several moves are possible that expose a hidden card. Moving the J♦ from column H onto the Q♠ in column G (H, 5, G) creates a sequence Q♠-J♦ (mixed suit) and reveals the card at H,4. This is generally preferred over moving a Q onto a K, as it continues building down in rank and uncovers a card.\nAnswer: (H,5,G)","Reasoning: Moving the J♠ from column A onto the Q♠ in column G builds a same-suit sequence (Q♠-J♠) and reveals a hidden card in column A. This is a constructive move that progresses the game towards building sequences and increasing visibility.\nAnswer: (A,5,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal Check:** The goal is to build K->A sequences and reveal hidden cards. No hits are available.\n2.  **Identify Moves:** Several moves are possible that reveal a hidden card and consolidate cards of the same suit.\n    *   (A,5,G): Moves J♠ onto Q♠, building Q♠-J♠. Reveals A[5].\n    *   (B,6,C): Moves 2♠ onto 3♠, building 3♠-2♠. Reveals B[6].\n    *   (B,7,D): Moves 5♥ onto 6♥, building 6♥-5♥. Reveals B[7].\n    *   (C,7,D): Moves A♥ onto 2♥, building 2♥-A♥.

Reveals J[4].\n3.  **Evaluate Moves:** All these moves are beneficial as they reveal a card and create or extend same-suit sequences. A good heuristic is to prioritize revealing cards from the deepest columns, as this generally opens up more possibilities sooner.\n4.  **Select Best Move:** Columns B (9 cards) and A, C, D (8 cards) are the deepest. Moves revealing cards in these columns are (A,5,G), (B,6,C), (B,7,D), and (C,7,D).\n    *   (B,7,D) reveals card B[7], the deepest hidden card currently accessible on the board.\n    *   It also builds a useful sequence (6♥-5♥).\n    *   It frees the A♠, which might be movable later.\n    *   Comparing this to other options: (B,6,C) reveals B[6] (not as deep), (A,5,G) reveals A[5] (not as deep), (C,7,D) reveals C[7] (not as deep).\n    *   Therefore, revealing the deepest card B[7] with move (B,7,D) appears to be the most strategically sound move.\n\nAnswer: (B,7,D)","Reasoning: The only available move is placing the A♥ from column C onto the 2♥ in column D. This follows the rule of moving a card onto another card of the same suit and one rank higher. It also helps consolidate the Heart suit.\nAnswer: (C,7,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal with no 'hit' chances remaining is to reveal hidden cards.\n2.  Several single-card moves are possible that reveal a hidden card by moving the current top card of a column onto the top card of another column where the ranks match (destination rank = source rank + 1).\n3.  Possible moves include: (A,6,I), (A,6,J), (D,5,F), (F,6,H), (G,5,E), (G,5,J), (H,6,G), (I,5,D).\n4.  We evaluate these moves based on the card revealed and the resulting board state.\n    *   (A,6,I)\/(A,6,J) reveal Q♣(A).\n    *   (D,5,F) reveals K♣(D).\n    *   (F,6,H) reveals 9♦(F).\n    *   (G,5,E)\/(G,5,J) reveal K♦(G).\n    *   (H,6,G) reveals 4♥(H).\n    *   (I,5,D) reveals Q♥(I).\n5.  Revealing a low card like 4♥ (via move H,6,G) is often beneficial as it might be movable sooner. Revealing Kings or Queens is also useful, but the resulting card placements for those moves ((D,5,F), (G,5,E), (G,5,J), (I,5,D)) involve placing cards on top of unrelated suits (e.g., 9♦ on 10♣, Q♠ on K♣, 8♥ on 9♦), which can block future same-suit sequences.\n6.  Move (H,6,G) moves J♦ onto Q♠. While different suits, it creates a descending sequence Q♠ J♦ which might be helpful later. Crucially, it reveals the 4♥ in column H. This seems like the most promising move.\n\nAnswer: (H,6,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards and create empty columns. Since there are no empty columns and 'hit' is not available, revealing hidden cards is the priority.\n2.  Moving 8♥ from column J (index 4) onto 9♥ in column I (index 4) achieves two objectives:\n    *   It reveals the hidden card at J,3.\n    *   It builds a same-suit sequence (9♥, 8♥) in column I.\n3.  Other potential moves, like (B,6,C) or (E,4,H), build sequences or move cards but do not reveal hidden cards, making (J,4,I) strategically better at this stage.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goals are to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Dealing new cards is not an option ('hit' chances = 0).\n2.  Several moves achieve these goals:\n    *   (B, 6, A): Move 2♠ onto 3♠(A). Uncovers 5♥ in B. Creates 3♠-2♠ run.\n    *   (B, 6, C): Move 2♠ onto 3♠(C). Uncovers 5♥ in B. Creates 3♠-2♠ run.\n    *   (B, 7, D): Move 5♥ onto 6♥(D). Uncovers A♠ in B. Creates 6♥-5♥ run.\n    *   (C, 7, D): Move A♥ onto 2♥(D). Uncovers 7♣ in C. Creates 2♥-A♥ run.\n    *   (E, 5, H): Move 2♣ onto 3♣(H). Uncovers 7♣ in E. Creates 3♣-2♣ run.\n    *   (H, 6, B): Move 4♥ onto 5♥(B). Uncovers J♦ in H. Creates 5♥-4♥ run.\n3.  Moving the 2♠ from column B to column A (or C) consolidates spades and uncovers the 5♥ in column B. This uncovered 5♥ immediately allows for another good move: moving the 4♥ from column H onto it (H,6,B). This sequence of moves uncovers two cards (5♥ then J♦) and builds two same-suit runs (3♠-2♠ and 5♥-4♥).\n4.  Choosing (B, 6, A) over (B, 6, C) places the 3♠-2♠ run under J♠ instead of another 3♠, which feels slightly more flexible.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,A)","Reasoning: Moving the A♥ from column C onto the 2♥ in column D accomplishes two important goals: it builds a same-suit sequence (2♥-A♥) and it uncovers the K♣ in column C. Uncovering Kings is strategically valuable as they can only move to empty columns, and knowing their location is key to future planning, especially when no more cards can be dealt.\n\nAnswer: (C,7,D)","Reasoning: The move (J,4,I) places the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I. This builds a same-suit sequence (9♥, 8♥) and, more importantly, reveals the hidden card at index 3 in column J (J[3]). Uncovering hidden cards is the top priority when no more 'hit' actions are available.\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: Moving the 2♣ from column E onto the 3♣ in column H builds a same-suit sequence (3♣-2♣). This action reveals the card underneath the 2♣ in column E, which is the 5♠. The 5♠ can then be moved onto the 6♥ in column D in the next step, potentially opening up further plays. Building same-suit sequences and revealing hidden cards are key objectives.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  There is an empty column (G), which is a valuable resource.\n2.  Moving a King to an empty column is generally a strong strategic move, as it helps organize the board and frees up the King's original column.\n3.  There are three Kings available to move to the empty column: K♦ in H, K♣ in D, and K♣ in J.\n4.  Moving K♣ from column D (index 6) to column G exposes the 9♦ underneath.\n5.  This exposed 9♦ can then be moved onto the 10♣ in column F in a subsequent move (D,6,F), which would expose a hidden card in column D. This sequence achieves two important goals: utilizing the empty column and exposing a hidden card.\n6.  While other moves like building same-suit sequences (e.g., (B,7,D), (C,7,D), (H,6,B)) are possible and expose cards, moving the King to the empty column sets up a more impactful follow-up play.\n\nAnswer: (D,6,G)","Reasoning: The best move is to consolidate same-suit runs where possible and reveal hidden cards. Moving the A♥ from column C onto the 2♥ in column D achieves both: it creates a 2♥-A♥ run and reveals the card at C[6]. This is generally preferable to moves that place cards of different suits on top of each other unless necessary, such as moving Q♠ onto K♣.\nAnswer: (C,7,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Uncover hidden cards as there are no more 'hit' opportunities. Building same-suit sequences is also beneficial.\n2.  **Analyze Moves:**\n    *   (A,6,D) or (A,6,J): Moves Q♣ onto K♣. Uncovers 7♦ in A. Consolidates clubs.\n    *   (B,8,C): Moves A♠ onto 2♠. Uncovers 5♥ in B. Builds a same-suit sequence (2♠, A♠).\n    *   (C,6,I): Moves 7♣ onto 8♥. Uncovers A♥ in C. Uncovers an Ace.\n    *   (E,6,D): Moves 5♠ onto 6♥. Uncovers K♣ in E. Uncovers a King.\n    *   (H,6,G), (H,6,I), or (H,6,J): Moves J♦ onto Q♠\/Q♥. Uncovers 4♥ in H. Mixes suits.\n3.  **Comparison:**\n    *   (B,8,C) achieves two goals: uncovering a card and building a same-suit sequence (2♠, A♠).\n    *   (E,6,D) uncovers a King, which is strategically important, but doesn't build a sequence.\n    *   (A,6,D)\/(A,6,J) consolidate suits and uncover a card.\n    *   (C,6,I) uncovers an Ace, less immediately useful.\n    *   (H,...) mixes suits, less ideal.\n4.  **Decision:** Move (B,8,C) seems best as it both uncovers a card and progresses a same-suit sequence.\n\nAnswer: (B,8,C)","Reasoning:\n1.  My primary goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  Several same-suit moves are possible: (E,4,H), (H,5,B), (H,8,I), (J,4,I).\n3.  Moving the 9♥-8♥ run from column J to column I (onto Q♥) creates a longer same-suit sequence (Q♥-9♥-8♥). This also reveals a hidden card in column J (J3). Consolidating runs is generally beneficial.\n4.  Other same-suit moves ((E,4,H), (H,5,B), (H,8,I)) only create 2-card runs.\n5.  Moving different suit cards is possible but less preferable than building same-suit sequences.\n6.  No 'hit' is possible as there are 0 hits remaining.\n\nTherefore, moving the 9♥-8♥ run from J to I is the most promising move.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Cannot 'hit'.\n2.  **Analyze Moves:** Several moves are possible.\n    *   **(A,5,G):** Move J♠ onto Q♠. Reveals 7♦. Creates a same-suit pair (Q♠-J♠). Good move.\n    *   **(H,5,B):** Move 4♥ onto 5♥. Reveals J♦. Creates a same-suit pair (5♥-4♥). Good move.\n    *   **(D,5,B\/C\/H):** Move 2♥ onto a 3. Reveals K♣. Breaks suit, but reveals a King. Medium move.\n    *   **(I,5,G\/D\/J):** Move Q♥-8♥ run. Reveals 9♥. Breaks suit. Medium move.\n3.  **Compare Best Moves:** Both (A,5,G) and (H,5,B) are strong candidates as they build same-suit pairs and uncover a hidden card. (H,5,B) reveals a Jack (J♦), which is generally more useful for uncovering Queens than the 7♦ revealed by (A,5,G). Revealing the K♣ with (D,5,...) is tempting, but it requires breaking suit immediately, potentially blocking the 2♥.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Prioritizing a same-suit move that uncovers a higher-ranked card seems best. (H,5,B) fits this criterion by revealing a Jack.\n\nAnswer: (H,5,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to expose hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  Moving the Q♣ from column A onto a K♣ starts building a potential sequence from the top down.\n3.  There are two K♣ available: one in column D (index 6) and one in column J (index 6).\n4.  Moving Q♣ (A,6) to K♣ (D,6) would cover the 2♥ (D,5). The 2♥ is needed for the A♥ (C,7).\n5.  Moving Q♣ (A,6) to K♣ (J,6) avoids covering the 2♥ in column D, keeping the option open to move A♥ (C,7) to 2♥ (D,5) later.\n6.  Both moves expose the J♠ (A,5).\n7.  Therefore, moving the Q♣ to the K♣ in column J is strategically better as it progresses the game by starting a sequence and exposing a card, while preserving another potential move.\n\nAnswer: (A,6,J)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Analyze Single Card Moves:** Check if any bottom card can move to the top card of another column (must be one rank higher, any suit for standard Spider, but the rule says \"same-suit run\" which usually applies to single cards too, implying same suit needed).\n    *   A[7] 7♦ needs 8♦. None visible.\n    *   B[8] A♠ needs 2♠. B[6] is 2♠, but covered by B[7]=5♥. 5♥ needs 6♥ (A[3], C[3], both covered). Move impossible.\n    *   C[7] A♥ needs 2♥. D[5] is 2♥, but covered by D[6]=9♦. 9♦ needs 10♦. Move impossible.\n    *   D[6] 9♦ needs 10♦. None visible.\n    *   E[7] 5♠ needs 6♠. None visible.\n    *   F[6] 10♣ needs J♣. None visible.\n    *   G[5] Q♠ needs K♠. None visible.\n    *   H[6] J♦ needs Q♦. None visible.\n    *   I[6] 8♥ needs 9♥. I[4] is 9♥ (covered by Q♥), J[4] is 9♥ (covered by Q♥). Moves impossible.\n    *   J[6] K♣ needs an empty column. None available.\n2.  **Analyze Run Moves:** Check for same-suit, descending runs.\n    *   B[5] starting with 3♠ contains the run (3♠, 2♠). This run needs a 4♠ to move onto. No 4♠ is visible at the top of any column.\n    *   No other movable same-suit runs are visible at the bottom of the stacks.\n3.  **Check for Dealing Cards ('Hit'):** The rules state 'hit' is possible if no legal moves remain, the deck has ≥10 cards, and every column is non-empty. However, the game state shows 0 remaining chances to 'hit'.\n4.  **Conclusion:** There are no legal moves available on the board (neither single cards nor runs can be moved). Normally, if moves are blocked, the next action would be 'hit'. Since 'hit' is also unavailable (0 remaining), the game is currently in a stalemate position with no possible actions left according to the rules. Given the strict output requirement is either a move or 'hit', and no move exists, the only non-move option provided in the format is 'hit', even though it cannot be executed.\n\nAnswer: hit","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  **Analyze Moves:** Several moves are possible that uncover a hidden card.\n    *   (C,7,D): A♥ onto 2♥. Uncovers card in C. Creates a same-suit sequence (2♥ A♥).\n    *   (G,5,E) or (G,5,J): Q♠ onto K♣. Uncovers card in G. Creates a mixed-suit sequence.\n    *   (H,6,A) or (H,6,G): J♦ onto Q♣\/Q♠. Uncovers card in H. Creates a mixed-suit sequence.\n    *   (I,7,D): 8♥ onto 9♦. Uncovers card in I. Creates a mixed-suit sequence.\n3.  **Comparison:** Moving A♥ onto 2♥ (C,7,D) is the only move that both uncovers a card *and* creates a same-suit sequence. Building same-suit sequences is crucial for eventually clearing cards and generally provides more flexibility than creating mixed-suit blocks. Therefore, this move is preferable.\n\nAnswer: (C,7,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  **Analyze Moves:** Several same-suit sequence building moves are possible: (I, 7, I) moves 8♥ onto 9♥, (B, 6, D) moves 5♥ onto 6♥, and (C, 7, D) moves A♥ onto 2♥.\n3.  **Evaluate (I, 7, I):** Moves 8♥ onto 9♥ in column I. This creates a 9♥-8♥ sequence and reveals the card underneath (Q♥ at index 6). Revealing a Queen is valuable.\n4.  **Evaluate (B, 6, D):** Moves 5♥ onto 6♥ in column D. This creates a 6♥-5♥ sequence and reveals the card underneath in column B (2♠ at index 5). This is also a good move.\n5.  **Evaluate (C, 7, D):** Moves A♥ onto 2♥ in column D. This creates a 2♥-A♥ sequence and reveals the card underneath in column C (7♣ at index 6). Also good.\n6.  **Compare:** Moving 8♥ to 9♥ (I, 7, I) seems slightly preferable because it reveals a high card (Q♥) directly and keeps the sequence within its original column, potentially allowing further building if a 10♥ becomes available.\n\nAnswer: (I,7,I)","Reasoning: The only available move is to place the A♥ from column C onto the 2♥ in column D.

Building same-suit sequences is also beneficial.\n5.  Move (D,7,F) uncovers K♣, which is strategically valuable.\n6.  Move (A,7,H) uncovers A♠ and creates a same-suit sequence [Q♥, 8♥, 7♦]. This seems slightly better as it makes progress on a sequence while also uncovering a card. The A♠ revealed might be easier to utilize than the K♣ revealed under a 2♥ by move (D,7,F).\n7.  Comparing (A,7,H) and (C,7,H), both uncover an Ace and place a card on 8♥. (A,7,H) uses 7♦, making a partial heart sequence Q♥-8♥-7♦. (C,7,H) uses 7♣, creating a mixed sequence Q♥-8♥-7♣. Therefore, (A,7,H) is preferable.\n\nAnswer: (A,7,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  There are no chances left to deal cards ('hit').\n2.  We need to find a move that ideally reveals a hidden card or helps build a sequence.\n3.  Moving the 9♦ from column D (index 7) to the 10♣ in column F (index 6) is possible: (D,7,F). This would reveal the K♣ at D,6. While revealing a card is good, having a K♣ at the bottom of a column can be blocking unless an empty column becomes available.\n4.  Moving the A♥ from column C (index 7) to the 2♥ in column D (index 5) is possible: (C,7,D). This reveals the 7♣ at C,6.

There are no hits remaining.\nLet's examine the possible moves:\n1.  Move A♥ from Column C (index 7) onto 2♥ in Column D (index 5). This is a valid move (A♥ onto 2♥). This move will reveal the hidden card at C,6.\n2.  No other single cards can move onto the top card of another column.\n3.  No same-suit runs can be moved.\n\nMoving A♥ from C to D is the only available move that progresses the game by revealing a hidden card.\n\nAnswer: (C,7,D)","Reasoning: Moving the A♠ from column B onto the 2♠ in the same column consolidates a same-suit sequence (2♠-A♠). This is a step towards building a full sequence and also reveals the next hidden card in column B (B,7), which is 5♥. While moving a K♣ to the empty column G is also a good option to reveal a card and free up space, creating the 2♠-A♠ sequence is slightly preferred as it directly progresses a suit build.\nAnswer: (B,8,B)","Reasoning: The primary goal with no hits remaining is to expose hidden cards and build sequences. Moving the Q♠ from column G onto one of the K♣ (column E or J) will expose the K♦ underneath it in column G. Exposing Kings is generally a high-priority move as they are the base of the required sequences. Building the 2♥-A♥ sequence (C,7,D) or the 9♥-8♥ sequence (I,6,I) are also good moves, but exposing a King often opens up more strategic possibilities. Moving Q♠ to K♣ in column E is chosen arbitrarily over column J.\n\nAnswer: (G,6,E)","Reasoning: Moving the A♥ from column C onto the 2♥ in column D creates a 2♥-A♥ sequence, progressing towards a full suit build. This move also reveals the card currently underneath the A♥ in column C, providing more information and potential future moves. While there are other moves that create sequences (like 8♥ onto 9♥), moving the Ace is often beneficial as it unblocks the card above it (the 2♥).\nAnswer: (C,6,D)","Reasoning: The only available move that builds a same-suit sequence is moving the 8♥ in column I onto the 9♥ directly above it in the same column.

The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences (K->A).\n2.  There are no more 'hit' chances available.\n3.  Several moves are possible that reveal hidden cards.\n4.  Moving 2♠ from column B to 3♠ in column C (B, 6, C) reveals the A♠ in column B.\n5.  This move creates a small same-suit sequence (3♠-2♠) in column C.\n6.  Crucially, revealing A♠ immediately allows another move: moving the newly revealed A♠ from B onto the 2♠ in C (B, 8, C). This second move builds the sequence 3♠-2♠-A♠ and reveals another hidden card in column B.\n7.  Other moves like (D, 7, F) reveal an Ace (A♥) but don't immediately enable a follow-up move for that Ace.\n8.  Therefore, starting the sequence with (B, 6, C) offers the best immediate potential for progress by revealing two cards and building a same-suit sequence in two steps.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,C)","Reasoning:\n1.  My main goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  Moving the 2♠-A♠ sequence from column B onto the 3♠ in column C achieves both.

Other potential moves like (C, 6, D) moving A♥ to 2♥ or (B, 6, F) moving 5♥ to 6♥ reveal cards we already know (C[5]=3♠, B[5]=2♠), making them less valuable than revealing an unknown card.\n5.  There are no hits remaining.\n\nAnswer: (B,5,C)","Reasoning: Moving the K♣ from column J onto the Q♣ in column A consolidates a same-suit sequence (Q♣-K♣) and reveals a new card (Q♥) in column J.

There are no more 'hit' chances available. Moves must be found.\n2.  There is an empty column (G). Empty columns are valuable resources for rearranging cards and uncovering hidden cards.\n3.  Moving a King to an empty column is often a good strategy, as it maximizes the utility of the empty column for future moves until the King itself can be part of a sequence or needs to be moved to free the column again.\n4.  There are two Kings available to move: K♣ at D(6) and K♣ at J(6).\n5.  Moving K♣ from D(6) to G (D,6,G) would reveal the card at D(5), which is 2♥.\n6.  Moving K♣ from J(6) to G (J,6,G) would reveal the card at J(5), which is Q♥.\n7.  Revealing a Queen (Q♥) is generally more beneficial than revealing a 2 (2♥), as Queens are higher rank and can accept Jacks, potentially opening up more sequence-building opportunities sooner. Moving the King from J also clears the card above it (8♥ at J(4)) to potentially receive the revealed Q♥ later if needed, although they are the same suit which is good but J(4) is 8♥ not J♥. Nevertheless, revealing Q♥ is strategically better.\n8.  Other moves exist, like moving 8♥ from I(6) to F(5) (revealing Q♥ at I(5)) or moving 10♣ from F(6) to H(6) (revealing 9♦ at F(5)). However, utilizing the empty column with a King is a fundamentally strong play in Spider Solitaire.\n\nTherefore, moving the King from column J to the empty column G is the best action.\n\nAnswer: (J,6,G)","Reasoning: Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I builds a same-suit sequence (9♥, 8♥). This action also reveals the card underneath the 8♥ in column J (which is Q♥), providing more information and potential moves. Building same-suit sequences and revealing hidden cards are the primary objectives when no more 'hits' are available.\nAnswer: (J,5,I)","Rationale:\n1.  The deck is empty, so no more 'hit' actions are possible. The goal is to make moves to uncover hidden cards and build sequences.\n2.  Several moves are possible:\n    *   (C,6,D): Move A♥ onto 2♥. Uncovers card C2.\n    *   (J,6,A): Move K♣ onto Q♣. Uncovers card J3.\n    *   (J,4,I): Move 8♥ onto 9♥. Uncovers card J4.\n3.  Comparing these moves:\n    *   (C,6,D) creates a mixed-suit stack (6♥-2♥-A♥).\n    *   (J,6,A) creates a same-suit stack (Q♣-K♣) but blocks the J♠ underneath.\n    *   (J,4,I) creates a same-suit run (9♥-8♥) at index I4. This is generally beneficial for future sequence building.\n4.  Creating a same-suit run while uncovering a card is often the best strategy when no immediate sequence completion or empty column creation is possible. Therefore, (J,4,I) is the preferred move.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: The primary goal with no hits remaining is to reveal hidden cards. Moving the 8♥ from column J (index 4) onto the 9♦ in column D (index 7) achieves this by flipping the card at J3. While this creates an out-of-suit sequence (9♦-8♥), uncovering a hidden card is the highest priority action available.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,D)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Moving the Q♣ run from column A onto the K♣ in column D achieves two things:\n1.  It uncovers the J♠ at A[5].\n2.  It places the Q♣ onto the K♣, starting a potential same-suit sequence in column D.\nThis revealed J♠ can then potentially be moved onto the Q♠ in column G, revealing another card. Other moves, like moving A♥ to 2♥, are less impactful as they don't immediately lead to further beneficial moves or uncover useful cards. Moving 4♥ to 5♥ would bury the A♠ in column B.\n\nAnswer: (A,6,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build sequences. Since there are no more 'hit' opportunities, revealing cards is the highest priority.\n2.  Several moves are available that reveal a hidden card. We should prioritize moves that reveal cards in the longest columns.\n3.  Columns A, B, C, D all have 7 or 8 cards (longest).\n4.  Possible moves revealing cards in these columns:\n    *   (A,6,I): Move 7♦ to 8♥ (I). Reveals card in A (length 7).\n    *   (C,6,D): Move A♥ to 2♥ (D). Reveals card in C (length 7).\n    *   (D,6,F): Move 9♦ to 10♣ (F). Reveals card in D (length 7).\n5.  All three moves above reveal a card in a column with 7 cards (Column B has 8 cards, but A♠ cannot move anywhere useful).\n6.

There are no 'hit' actions remaining (0 chances left).\n2.  We must find a valid card move.\n3.  Examine column B: It ends with A♠ at index 8, on top of 2♠ at index 7, on top of 3♠ at index 6. This forms a 3♠-2♠-A♠ run. However, the indices provided in the board state seem 0-based and only show the face-up cards. Let's re-read the board carefully:\n    - B: ... XX(4), 3♠(5), 2♠(6), A♠(7). The face-up run starts at index 6 (2♠) and goes to index 7 (A♠). The run is 2♠-A♠.\n    - C: ... XX(4), 3♠(5), 7♣(6), K♣(7). The top card is 3♠ at index 5.\n4.  Revisiting the move: We look for a run that can be placed onto the top card of another column.\n    - Consider the run 2♠-A♠ in column B, starting at index 6.\n    - Consider column C, whose top card is 3♠ (at index 5).\n    - A 2♠ can be placed on a 3♠ of the same suit.\n    - Therefore, moving the run starting at B, index 6 (which is 2♠-A♠) onto column C is a valid move.\n5.  This move (B,6,C) consolidates the ♠ sequence (3♠-2♠-A♠) in column C and reveals the hidden card at index 5 in column B. Revealing hidden cards is crucial, especially with no hits left.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,C)","Reasoning: Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I creates a same-suit sequence (9♥-8♥). This consolidation is helpful, and it also reveals the Q♥ card underneath in column J (at index J5), potentially opening up further plays. Revealing face-down cards or creating same-suit sequences are primary goals when no hits are available.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  **Identify Moves:** Look for moves that achieve these goals.\n    *   Several single-card moves are possible that reveal hidden cards (e.g., (A,7,I), (B,8,D), (C,7,B), etc.).\n    *   One move builds a same-suit sequence: moving the 4♥ (H, index 5) onto the 5♥ (B, index 7).\n3.  **Evaluate (H,5,B):**\n    *   Moves 4♥ from column H onto 5♥ in column B.\n    *   This creates a 5♥-4♥ sequence in column B.\n    *   This reveals the card underneath the 4♥ in column H (which is 3♣ at H, index 4).\n4.  **Conclusion:** The move (H,5,B) is the best because it both builds a same-suit sequence and uncovers a hidden card, advancing the game state more effectively than other available single-card moves.\n\nAnswer: (H,5,B)","Reasoning: The best move is to uncover a hidden card to open up possibilities, as there are no more 'hit' chances left. Moving the 3-card sequence (3♠, 2♠, A♠) from column B to column H reveals the hidden card at B[4]. While this move places the sequence onto an off-suit card (4♥), revealing a new card is the highest priority action right now. Moving a King to the empty column G would not reveal a hidden card in this state.\n\nAnswer: (B,5,H)","Reasoning: Moving the 5♥ from column B onto the 6♥ in column F achieves two important goals: it builds a longer same-suit sequence (6♥-5♥) and it uncovers the hidden card (A♠) at index 8 in column B. Revealing hidden cards is a priority, especially with no hits left. This move also sets up a potential follow-up move where the 4♥ from column H could be moved onto the 5♥.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,F)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify potential moves:\n    *   (C,7,D): Move A♥ from column C onto 2♥ in column D. This reveals the card at C[6] (7♣).\n    *   (H,5,B): Move 4♥ from column H onto 5♥ in column B. This reveals the card at H[4] (3♣).\n2.  Evaluate moves:\n    *   (C,7,D) reveals a card but places A♥ on top of 2♥, blocking it.\n    *   (H,5,B) reveals a card (3♣) and creates a same-suit run (5♥-4♥) in column B. This run could potentially be moved later onto the 6♥ visible in column D.\n3.  Conclusion: Creating a same-suit run is generally more advantageous than just revealing a card, especially when the revealed cards (7♣ vs 3♣) don't offer immediate follow-up moves. Move (H,5,B) is preferred.\n\nAnswer: (H,5,B)","Reasoning: The move (C,7,D) places the A♥ onto the 2♥, creating a same-suit sequence (2♥-A♥) in column D. This progresses towards building a full sequence and also exposes the card underneath A♥ in column C (which is 7♣). Utilizing the empty column G is also a good strategy, but building sequences directly is often preferable. There are no hits left, so exposing hidden cards and consolidating sequences is crucial.\nAnswer: (C,7,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  Check for same-suit runs that can be moved:\n    *   B(5) 3♠, 2♠ needs 4♠. No 4♠ visible.\n2.  Check for single cards that can be moved:\n    *   C(6) A♥ can move onto D(5) 2♥. This reveals card C(5).\n    *   H(6) J♦ can move onto G(4) K♦. This reveals card H(5).\n3.  Compare the two best moves: (C,6,D) and (H,6,G). Both reveal a hidden card, which is the primary goal when stuck.\n    *   (C,6,D) moves A♥ onto 2♥, creating a short sequence but potentially making the D column less flexible. It reveals C(5).\n    *   (H,6,G) moves J♦ onto K♦, creating a K♦, J♦ sequence which is slightly more valuable as it starts building from a King. It reveals H(5).\n4.  With no hits remaining and limited turns, revealing cards is crucial. Building a K-J sequence is slightly preferable to a 2-A sequence. Therefore, moving the J♦ onto the K♦ is the better option.\n\nAnswer: (H,6,G)","Reasoning: The primary goals are to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Moving the A♥ from column C onto the 2♥ in column D achieves both of these goals. It will reveal the hidden card at C,5 and create a 2-card heart sequence (2♥-A♥) in column D. Moving the 2♣ from E to H would also reveal a card, but it creates a mixed-suit sequence and doesn't progress towards a same-suit build as effectively as the A♥ move. There are no hits available.\n\nAnswer: (C,6,D)","Reasoning: Moving the 4♥ from column H onto the 5♥ in column B creates a same-suit sequence (5♥, 4♥). This helps organize the board and reveals the card underneath the 4♥ in column H (which is 3♣), potentially opening up new moves. While moving the 2♠ from B onto the 3♠ in C is also a valid consolidation move, revealing an Ace is generally less impactful than revealing a potentially connectable card like 3♣ at this stage.\nAnswer: (H,1,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to build sequences down to Ace, preferably of the same suit.\n2.  Revealing hidden cards is crucial.\n3.  Moving existing same-suit sequences is generally better than breaking them or creating mixed-suit sequences unless it reveals a critical card or opens up an empty column.\n4.  Column I has a Q♥-8♥ sequence (indices 5 and 6) on top of a face-down card (covered by 9♥ at index 4).\n5.  Column G has K♦ at index 4.\n6.  Moving the Q♥-8♥ sequence from column I (starting at index 5) onto the K♦ in column G consolidates this sequence under its King.\n7.  This move (I,5,G) achieves two objectives:\n    *   It progresses the Heart sequence (K♦-Q♥-8♥).\n    *   It reveals the card at index 4 in column I (which is 9♥).\n\nOther moves like moving Q♠ from G to a K♣ would reveal K♦, which is also good, but moving the existing ♥ sequence seems slightly more productive towards completing a suit. Moving 8♥ alone from I would break the sequence. Moving 2♣ from E would reveal a card but only build a mixed sequence.\n\nTherefore, moving the Q♥-8♥ sequence from I to G is the most strategic move.\n\nAnswer: (I,5,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Identify Goal:** The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards to enable more moves and eventually build sequences. Secondary goals include building same-suit sequences and emptying columns (though no empty columns are possible right now).\n2.  **List Potential Moves:** Examine the bottom card of each column and see where it can legally move (onto a card of one rank higher).

Creates 9♥-8♥ sequence.\n3.  **Comparison:** All three moves uncover a card and build a small same-suit sequence. Moving within the same column (like B and I) is often preferable as it doesn't occupy the base card of another column. Between (B, 8, B) and (I, 6, I), building the higher-ranked sequence 9♥-8♥ seems slightly more advantageous. Uncovering the Q♥ at I[5] could also be useful.\n4.  **Chosen Move:** (I, 6, I) seems the most promising move as it builds a same-suit sequence within the same column and uncovers a card.\n\nAnswer: (I,6,I)","Reasoning: The highest priorities are to reveal hidden cards and utilize the empty column (G). Moving the K♣ from column D to the empty column G reveals the card at D,5 (2♥ becomes visible, although it was already known) and places the King in an advantageous position.

Another possible move is (B, 8, C), moving A♠ onto 2♠. This would expose the card at B,7 (5♥) and create a small 2♠-A♠ run.\n5.  Comparing the two: Moving the K♣ (J, 6, G) utilizes the empty column effectively and exposes a potentially useful Queen (Q♥). Moving the A♠ (B, 8, C) exposes a lower-rank card (5♥). Moving the King to an empty column is generally a stronger strategic play.\n\nAnswer: (J,6,G)","Reasoning:\n1.

The primary goal with limited turns and no more hits is to reveal hidden cards (XX) to find potential plays and sequence building opportunities.\n2.  Several moves are possible. We want to choose the one that reveals a hidden card or enables further moves that reveal hidden cards.\n3.  Possible moves revealing hidden cards:\n    *   (A,7,1,I): Move 7♦ onto 8♥(I,6).

More importantly, it uncovers the hidden card at G(3).\n4.  Comparing these two:\n    *   Moving 7♦ via (A,7,1,I) frees up the Q♣ at A(6). This Q♣ can then be moved onto the K♣ at J(6). This follow-up move (A,6,1,J) would reveal another hidden card at A(4). This sequence reveals two hidden cards.\n    *   Moving Q♠ via (G,5,1,J) frees up the K♦ at G(4). A King can only move to an empty column, and there are none. So this move only reveals one hidden card and doesn't immediately enable further revealing moves.\n5.  Therefore, the move (A,7,1,I) is strategically better as it initiates a sequence likely to reveal more hidden cards.\n\nAnswer: (A,7,1,I)","Reasoning: The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Moving the A♥ from column C (index 8) onto the 2♥ in column D (index 5) achieves both. It starts a potential Heart sequence (2♥, A♥) in column D and, crucially, reveals the card at index 7 in column C (which is 5♥). This revealed 5♥ can potentially be moved onto the 6♥ in column D on a later turn, revealing yet another card. This sequence of moves helps clear column C and build towards a Heart sequence. Other moves like (B,8,B) or (I,6,I) also build sequences and reveal cards, but the potential two-step reveal from (C,8,D) seems slightly more advantageous.\n\nAnswer: (C,8,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify available moves: Several moves are possible, including moving single cards or same-suit runs.\n    *   (A,5,G): J♠ onto Q♠ (reveals XX)\n    *   (B,8,C): A♠ onto 2♠ (reveals 5♥, builds 2♠-A♠)\n    *   (C,7,D): A♥ onto 2♥ (reveals K♣, builds 2♥-A♥)\n    *   (D,7,F): 9♦ onto 10♣ (reveals K♣, breaks suit)\n    *   (E,6,H): 5♠ onto 6♥ (reveals 7♣, breaks suit)\n    *   (F,6,I): 10♣ onto J♦ (reveals 9♦, breaks suit)\n    *   (H,6,A\/G\/I\/J): J♦ onto Qx (reveals 4♥, breaks suit)\n    *   (I,6,F): 8♥ onto 9♦ (reveals Q♥, breaks suit)\n2.  Evaluate moves based on priorities:\n    *   Uncover hidden cards: (A,5,G) is the only move that directly reveals a hidden card, but others reveal face-down cards after moving.\n    *   Build same-suit sequences: (B,8,C) and (C,7,D) are the best here.\n    *   Reveal useful cards: (C,7,D) reveals K♣ in column C. (D,7,F) reveals K♣ in column D. Revealing Kings is generally valuable.\n3.  Compare best options:\n    *   (B,8,C) builds 2♠-A♠ and reveals 5♥.\n    *   (C,7,D) builds 2♥-A♥ and reveals K♣.\n    *   (D,7,F) reveals K♣ but breaks suit (9♦ on 10♣).\n4.  Choose the best move: (C,7,D) is slightly better than (B,8,C) because revealing a King (K♣) is generally more advantageous than revealing a 5♥. It also builds a same-suit sequence, making it superior to (D,7,F) which breaks suit.\n\nAnswer: (C,7,D)","Reasoning: The highest priority is to uncover hidden cards, especially since there are no 'hit' chances remaining and the game is near the turn limit. Moving the Q♣ from column A (index 6) onto the K♣ in column J (index 6) is a valid move because K♣ is the bottom card of column J and is one rank higher than Q♣. This move will reveal the hidden card at index A4.\n\nAnswer: (A,6,J)","Reasoning: The only possible move on the board is to place the A♥ from column C onto the 2♥ in column D. No other cards can be moved, there are no empty columns to move Kings to, and no more cards can be dealt ('hit'). Therefore, this is the mandatory next action.\n\nAnswer: (C,7,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  The game is very close to the end (Epoch 95\/100) and there are no more 'hit' chances left.\n2.  The priority is to reveal hidden cards or complete sequences.\n3.  Let's check possible moves:\n    *   A♠ (B,7) can move onto 2♠ (B,5). This is a move within the same column (B,7,B). While potentially possible in some implementations, it doesn't reveal cards and the standard notation suggests moves *between* columns.\n    *   A♥ (C,6) can move onto 2♥ (D,4). This is move (C,6,D). It moves between columns but reveals C,5 which is 7♣ (already visible). No hidden card revealed.\n    *   8♥ (I,6) can move onto 9♥ (I,4). This is also a move within the same column (I,6,I). It builds a Q♥-9♥-8♥ sequence, which is good, but doesn't reveal cards and might not be a standard move format interpretation.\n    *   No movable same-suit runs exist that can move to another column. Q♥-8♥ in column I needs a K♥.\n4.  Since no move reveals hidden cards and completing a sequence is impossible in the remaining turns, we should make a valid move that follows the standard interpretation.\n5.  Moving between columns is the most standard interpretation. The only such move is (C,6,D). Although it doesn't reveal hidden cards, it is a valid progression.\n\nAnswer: (C,6,D)","Reasoning: The only potentially useful moves involve the Q♣ in column A. It can move onto either K♣ in column D or column J. Moving it reveals the 7♦ underneath in column A. Moving it onto a King starts building a potential sequence. Let's move it to column D.\n\nAnswer: (A,6,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  The game is very close to the end (Epoch 97\/100), and there are no more 'hit' chances. The priority is to uncover cards and potentially create sequences quickly.\n2.  Several moves are possible: (C,7,B) moves A♥->2♠ uncovering K♣, (D,7,F) moves 9♦->10♣ uncovering K♣, (H,6,A) moves J♦->Q♣ uncovering 4♥, (I,5,D) moves 8♥->9♦ uncovering Q♥.\n3.  While uncovering Kings ((C,7,B) or (D,7,F)) is usually a high priority, neither of those moves seems to enable an immediate follow-up move.\n4.  Moving J♦ from H to A via (H,6,A) uncovers 4♥ in column H. This newly uncovered 4♥ can then be immediately moved onto the 5♠ in column E. This sequence guarantees uncovering at least two cards (4♥, then the card under it in H) and potentially enabling more moves. Therefore, it seems the most productive action given the limited turns remaining.\n\nAnswer: (H,6,A)","Reasoning:\n1.  The game is very close to the end (Epoch 98\/100), with no more 'hit' chances available. Each move needs to maximize progress.\n2.

Reveals card at E4.\n    *   (I,5,D): Move Q♥ to K♣. Reveals card at I5. Creates mixed suit stack.\n    *   (I,5,J): Move Q♥ to K♣. Reveals card at I5. Creates mixed suit stack.\n    *   (J,4,I): Move 8♥ to 9♥. Reveals card at J4 and builds a 9♥-8♥ sequence.\n    *   (J,5,D): Move Q♥ to K♣. Reveals card at J5. Creates mixed suit stack.\n4.  Comparing the moves: Moving cards onto different suits (like Q♥ onto K♣) is generally less desirable unless it opens up critical plays, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Moves (A,5,G) and (E,4,H) only reveal a hidden card. Move (J,4,I) both reveals a hidden card (at J4) and builds a same-suit sequence (9♥-8♥ at column I). This achieves two objectives simultaneously, making it the most beneficial move.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: It's the last turn (Epoch 99\/100) and no 'hit' is possible.

Exposes 2♥.\n- Moving 8♥ (I,7) to 9♦ (F,7) is possible: (I,7,F). Exposes Q♥.\n\nMoving 9♦ from D to F (D,6,F) exposes the 2♥. This 2♥ could then potentially be moved onto the 3♣ in column H, which would expose a hidden card in column D. Exposing hidden cards is generally a good strategy, even if it's the last turn.\n\nAnswer: (D,6,F)","Since this is the final turn (Epoch 100\/100) and no K->A sequences can be completed with a single move, any legal move is effectively equivalent as it won't change the score or allow further actions. However, a common heuristic is to create longer same-suit runs or reveal cards.\n\nLet's analyze the available moves:\n1.  **(B,6,C)**: Move 2♠ onto 3♠. Reveals 5♥ at B,7. Creates 3♠-2♠ run.\n2.  **(B,7,D)**: Move 5♥ onto 6♥. Reveals A♠ at B,8. Creates 6♥-5♥ run.\n3.  **(C,7,D)**: Move A♥ onto 2♥. Reveals 7♣ at C,6. Creates 2♥-A♥ run.\n4.  **(J,6,I)**: Move 8♥ onto 9♥. Reveals Q♥ at J,5. Creates 9♥-8♥ run.\n\nAll moves create a 2-card same-suit run. Moves 2, 3, and 4 reveal the card directly beneath the moved card(s). Move 1 reveals the card that was above the moved card in the source column. Revealing cards is generally good, but irrelevant on the last turn unless it leads to a completion. Creating longer runs is also good. Moves 2, 3, and 4 all involve Hearts. Move (J,6,I) consolidates 9♥ and 8♥ and reveals a Q♥, which seems like a standard beneficial move type (consolidating sequences, revealing potentially useful cards).\n\nAnswer: (J,6,I)"],"prompt":"\nYou are a Spider Solitaire expert.

This builds a same-suit sequence and reveals a hidden card in column E.\nAnswer: (E,4,G)","Reasoning: The goal is to build same-suit sequences from King down to Ace. Moving the Q♥ from column E onto the K♥ in column G starts building a valuable heart sequence (K♥-Q♥). This move also reveals a hidden card in column E, which is crucial for progressing the game, especially since no more cards can be dealt ('hit' is unavailable). Other moves reveal cards but don't build towards a same-suit sequence as effectively.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify possible moves. The only empty column is J.\n2.  Single card moves:\n    *   K♦ from A (A,5) can move to J. This uncovers card A4.\n    *   K♦ from E (E,5) can move to J.

This is not a same-suit sequence, so Q♥ cannot be moved together with K♦. No sequence moves are possible.\n4.  Compare King moves:\n    *   Moving K♦ from E (E,5,J) reveals Q♥. This Q♥ could potentially move onto the K♥ in column G later, helping build a sequence.\n    *   Moving K♦ from A (A,5,J) reveals an unknown card (A4).\n5.  Revealing the Q♥ seems slightly more advantageous as it's a known card with a potential target (K♥), directly contributing to sequence building possibilities.

This continues a same-suit sequence and exposes a hidden card in column E, which is a primary goal in Spider Solitaire, especially when no more hits are available.\nAnswer: (E,4,G)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards and create sequences. Moving the K♥ from column F to the empty column J achieves two things: it reveals the hidden card at F4 and it places the King in an empty column, which is often a good starting point for building a sequence or simply getting the King out of the way. Other possible moves like (E,4,G), (G,4,B), or (I,4,D) also reveal hidden cards but moving the King seems strategically stronger, especially since there are no immediate same-suit sequences to build.\n\nAnswer: (F,4,J)","Reasoning: The only move available that builds upon an existing card and simultaneously exposes a hidden card is moving the A♦ from column I onto the 2♠ in column D. While moving a card to the empty column J would also expose a card, placing the A♦ specifically progresses the potential for future sequences in column D, even if the suits don't match immediately.\nAnswer: (I,4,D)","Reasoning: The best move is (E,5,G) because it moves the Q♥ onto the K♥. This creates a valuable same-suit sequence (K♥-Q♥) which is the primary way to win the game. Additionally, this move exposes a new face-down card in column E, providing more information and potential future moves. Other available moves either don't create same-suit sequences or are less likely to lead to useful arrangements.\n\nAnswer: (E,5,G)","Reasoning: The only available legal move is to place the Q♥ from column E onto the K♥ in column G. This move helps build a same-suit sequence and reveals a hidden card in column E. Since there are no 'hit' chances left, making any possible move is necessary.\nAnswer: (E,4,G)","Reasoning: There are no valid moves available. No face-up card or run can be moved onto another column according to the rules (descending sequence of the same suit onto a card one rank higher). The Kings in columns A (K♦) and G (K♥) cannot be moved as there are no empty columns. Since no moves are possible, the only alternative action is to deal new cards ('hit'). Although the game state indicates 0 hits remaining, the prompt requires suggesting either a move or 'hit'. In the absence of any legal moves, 'hit' is the default action type required by the output format.\n\nAnswer: hit","Reasoning: The only same-suit move available is moving the Q♥ from column E onto the K♥ in column G.

This action reveals a hidden card in column E, which is crucial for progressing in the game. Empty columns are valuable resources for rearranging sequences, and placing a King there keeps the column available for future King placements or long sequence moves.

No other moves are possible, and there are no 'hit' chances remaining.\nAnswer: (E,4,G)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to expose hidden cards. We have two empty columns (I and J). Several single cards can be moved to an empty column: 9♥ from C, 2♠ from D, 4♠ from F, 6♥ from G, and A♦ from H. Moving 9♥ or 2♠ won't expose new cards as the cards above them (Q♥ and 3♥) are already face-up. Moving 4♠ (F,4), 6♥ (G,4), or A♦ (H,4) to an empty column (like I) will expose a hidden card underneath. Moving 4♠ onto 5♣ (B,5) or A♦ onto 2♠ (D,5) would also expose cards but would create mixed-suit stacks and potentially block future moves.

Moving the King of Clubs (K♣) from column I to the empty column J achieves this by uncovering a hidden card in column I. This is generally a better strategy than moving the King of Hearts (K♥), which would only reveal the Jack of Diamonds (J♦) that currently has no available moves.\nAnswer: (I,4,J)","Reasoning: No face-up card or valid run can be moved onto another column according to the rules. For example, A♣ needs a 2♣, 3♠ needs a 4♠, J♦ needs a Q♦, K♥ needs an empty column, 5♥ needs a 6♥, 10♦ needs a J♦, Q♠ needs a K♠, 6♣ needs a 7♣, J♠ needs a Q♠, and K♣ needs an empty column. None of the required target cards or empty columns are available. Although no moves are possible, the rules state 'hit' can only be used if cards remain in the deck (hit chances > 0) and all columns are non-empty. Here, hit chances are 0. Therefore, no valid action (move or hit) can be taken. The game is stuck.

Two moves achieve this: (G,4,C) moving 10♦ onto J♦, and (J,4,H) moving J♠ onto Q♠. Moving J♠ onto Q♠ creates a same-suit sequence (Q♠, J♠), which is generally preferable to creating a mixed-suit sequence. Therefore, (J,4,H) is the better move.\nAnswer: (J,4,H)","Reasoning: The goal is to create same-suit sequences and reveal hidden cards. Moving the J♠ from column I onto the Q♠ in column G achieves both: it creates a Q♠-J♠ sequence and will reveal the card at I,3.

Moving J♠ from column I onto Q♠ in column G reveals a card in I and creates a same-suit sequence (Q♠-J♠), which is a primary goal. Moving 10♦ onto J♦ (F,4,C) is also a good option for the same reasons. Moving Q♠ onto either K (G,4,D or G,4,J) reveals a card but places cards out of suit, potentially blocking the Kings. Moving J♦ onto Q♠ (C,4,G) or 5♥ onto 6♣ (E,4,H) also reveals cards but uses mixed suits. Creating the same-suit Q♠-J♠ sequence is a strong move.\nAnswer: (I,4,G)","Reasoning: The goal is to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Moving the J♠ from column I onto the Q♠ in column G achieves both: it uncovers the card at (I,3) and creates a valuable two-card same-suit sequence (Q♠-J♠).

(B,4,A): Moving 8♥ onto 9♥ creates a 9♥-8♥ sequence.\n2. (D,4,G): Moving 10♣ onto J♣ creates a J♣-10♣ sequence.\n3. (E,4,F): Moving 5♣ onto 6♣ creates a 6♣-5♣ sequence.\n\nAll three moves reveal a hidden card in the source column. Creating the highest-ranking same-suit sequence (J♣-10♣) is generally a good heuristic, as it works towards completing a King-to-Ace sequence from the top down.\n\nAnswer: (D,4,G)","Reasoning: Moving the 8♥ from column B onto the 9♥ in column A forms a same-suit sequence (9♥-8♥) and, crucially, reveals a hidden card in column B. Revealing hidden cards is essential for progressing the game, especially when no sequences can be completed or empty columns utilized.\nAnswer: (B,4,A)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Identify potential moves:**\n    *   8♥ (B) can move onto 9♥ (A). This reveals a card in B.\n    *   10♣ (D) can move onto J♣ (G). This reveals a card in D.\n    *   5♣ (E) can move onto 6♣ (F). This reveals a card in E.\n2.  **Evaluate moves:** All three moves are beneficial as they build same-suit sequences and reveal a hidden card. There are no more 'hit' chances, so revealing cards is crucial.\n3.  **Prioritize:** Moving 5♣ (E) to 6♣ (F) reveals the card at index E[3], which is slightly higher up than the cards revealed by the other moves (B[4] or D[4]). Revealing cards higher in the tableau can sometimes provide more flexibility sooner. This move also combines clubs.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,F)","Reasoning:\n1.  Moving the K♠ from column G to an empty column (I or J) is a strong strategic move.\n2.  This frees up column G, revealing the hidden card beneath the K♠.\n3.  Having an empty column is valuable for rearranging sequences and temporarily holding cards. Placing a King there is ideal as only Kings can start a full sequence in an empty column.\n4.  Other available moves, like (B,5,A), (C,4,D), or (D,5,E), build small same-suit sequences and reveal cards, but utilizing the empty column with the King offers more long-term flexibility.\n\nAnswer: (G,5,I)","Reasoning: Moving the 10♣ from column D onto the J♣ in column G builds a same-suit sequence (J♣-10♣) and reveals a hidden card in column D (D,3).

This is one of the few available moves that progresses the game by uncovering a card.\n\nAnswer: (D,4,G)","Reasoning: The primary goal at this stage, with no ability to 'hit' and few turns left, is to uncover hidden cards. There are three possible moves that achieve this:\n1.  (B,5,A): Moves 8♥ onto 9♥, uncovering a card in column B.\n2.  (D,5,G): Moves 10♣ onto J♣, uncovering a card in column D.\n3.  (E,4,F): Moves 5♣ onto 6♣, uncovering a card in column E.\n\nAll three moves are beneficial as they reveal a new card. Moves 2 and 3 also consolidate cards of the same suit (Clubs), which is generally helpful. Moving the 10♣ onto the J♣ (Move 2) involves higher-ranked cards, potentially bringing us closer to a sequence, although completion is unlikely. Uncovering any card is the most critical action. I'll choose (D,5,G).\n\nAnswer: (D,5,G)","Reasoning: Several moves are possible that reveal hidden cards. Moving the 10♣ from column D onto the J♣ in column G uncovers a hidden card in column D and starts building a sequence within the same suit (Clubs).

This creates a J♣-10♣ sequence and reveals a card in column D.\n3.  Move 5♣ (E,4) onto 6♣ (F,4). This creates a 6♣-5♣ sequence and reveals a card in column E.\n\nSince this is the last turn (Epoch 99\/100), any valid move will end the game.

Column D's 10♣ can move onto Column G's J♣. This is also a valid move.\n\nAll these moves create a short same-suit sequence and reveal one hidden card.

Revealing hidden cards is crucial for progress. Creating sequences is also essential. There isn't a strong reason to prefer one over the other based purely on the immediate board state. However, consolidating suits can be beneficial. Since we have a K♥ visible (in column C), building the Heart sequence might be slightly more advantageous long-term.

This move prioritizes uncovering hidden cards and creating space over combining the J♦ and Q♦, which is also a valid but potentially less impactful move at this stage.\nAnswer: (D,4,I)","Reasoning: The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build sequences. Moving the Q♦ from column I onto the K♠ in column D achieves both:\n1. It reveals the hidden card at I,4.\n2. It creates a K♠-Q♦ sequence, consolidating cards.\nWhile this sequence mixes suits (♠ and ♦), revealing a card is crucial at this stage, especially with no hits remaining. Other possible moves involve placing Jacks onto the Q♦, but moving the Q♦ itself opens up column I for potential plays and builds a longer sequence immediately.\n\nAnswer: (I,4,D)","Reasoning: Moving the K♠ from column D to an empty column (H) is beneficial because it reveals the hidden card underneath it in column D. Kings can only be moved to empty columns, so utilizing an available empty column for the K♠ is a good strategic play. This opens up possibilities for future moves involving the Q♦ in column D.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,H)","This is the only available move. Moving the Jack of Diamonds (J♦) from column C onto the Queen of Diamonds (Q♦) in column F consolidates a same-suit sequence and reveals a hidden card in column C, which is generally a good strategy.\n\nAnswer: (C,5,F)","Reasoning: The only available move is to relocate the K♠ from column D to an empty column. This is beneficial because it frees up the card underneath it (Q♦) and utilizes one of the empty columns, which are often needed for building sequences or temporary storage. Moving K♠ to column H is a valid choice.\nAnswer: (D,5,H)","Reasoning: The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build sequences. There are four empty columns (G, H, I, J) which provide flexibility. Moving the longest possible same-suit run to an empty column is a good strategy. The `K♠ J♠` sequence in column D can be moved to an empty column (e.g., G). This move reveals the card at D(3) and places the King sequence in an advantageous empty column. Other moves like `(C,4,G)` or `(B,4,H)` would also reveal cards, but moving the King sequence is often prioritized.\n\nAnswer: (D,4,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  There are empty columns (H, I, J), which allow moving any card\/run to them.\n2.  Moving cards to empty columns reveals hidden cards underneath.\n3.  Column D has K♠ at the bottom (index 5). Moving a King to an empty column is strategically good because sequences are built downwards from Kings.\n4.  Moving K♠ from D to H (D,5,H) will reveal the card at D4 (Q♦). This is generally preferred over moving non-King cards to empty columns unless there's a specific sequence to build.\n5.  While moving J♦ from C to D (C,5,D) creates a Q♦-J♦ sequence, it uses the J♦ to cover the K♠, potentially hindering future moves with the K♠. It also only reveals one card (in C). Moving the K♠ first (D,5,H) also reveals one card (Q♦) and positions the King well.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,H)","Reasoning: The only productive moves available involve moving the K♠ or the J♠ K♠ run from column D to one of the empty columns (G, H, I, J). Moving the entire run (J♠ K♠) is generally preferred as it keeps the sequence together and exposes a hidden card underneath (at D,3). Let's move it to the first empty column, G.\n\nAnswer: (D,4,G)","Reasoning: The only available legal move is to place the J♦ from column C onto the Q♦ in column G. This will uncover a hidden card in column C. There are no other possible moves and no more hits are available.\nAnswer: (C,4,G)","Reasoning: The only possible move is to place the Jack of Diamonds (J♦) from column C onto the Queen of Diamonds (Q♦) in column G. This builds a sequence and reveals the card underneath the J♦ in column C. There are no other moves available, and no more cards can be dealt ('hit').\n\nAnswer: (C,5,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  There are no hits remaining, so I must find a legal move.\n2.  Several moves are possible:\n    *   Move J♦ from C (index 5) onto Q♦ in D. This creates a Q♦-J♦ sequence and reveals the card at C[4].\n    *   Move the J♠-K♠ sequence from E (index 4) to an empty column (H, I, or J). This reveals the card at E[3] and utilizes an empty column.\n3.  Moving the J♠-K♠ sequence (E,4,H) is generally preferable because:\n    *   It reveals a hidden card in column E.\n    *   It utilizes an empty column, which increases flexibility for future moves.\n    *   Moving Kings (especially heading sequences) out of the way can clear space for building other sequences.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,H)","Reasoning: The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build sequences. Moving the J♦ (C,5) onto the Q♦ (G,4) achieves both: it creates a two-card same-suit sequence (Q♦-J♦) and reveals the card at C,4. Moving the K♠ (D,5) to an empty column would also reveal a card (D,4), but placing a King in an empty column is often less flexible than keeping the column free, and creating the Q♦-J♦ sequence is a direct step towards clearing cards. Therefore, moving the J♦ is preferable.\nAnswer: (C,5,G)","Reasoning: The only available move that progresses the game by building a same-suit sequence and uncovering a hidden card is moving the J♠ from column H onto the K♠ in column D.\n\nAnswer: (H,4,D)","Reasoning: Moving the K♠ from column D to an empty column (like H) is the best move. This action achieves two important goals:\n1.  It creates an empty column (H), which provides valuable maneuvering space.\n2.  It frees up the Q♦ in column D, potentially allowing the J♠ from column E to be moved onto it later, which would uncover a hidden card in column E.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,H)","Reasoning: The primary goal with no hits remaining is to uncover hidden cards. Several single-card moves are possible: J♥(B) onto Q♦(G), J♦(C) onto Q♦(G), J♥(E) onto Q♦(G), Q♦(G) onto K♠(D), J♠(H) onto Q♦(G), and A♠(I) onto 2♥(A). Moving onto the K♠(D) or Q♦(G) would cover potentially useful high cards. Moving A♠(I) onto 2♥(A) uncovers a card in column I without blocking a high card.\nAnswer: (I,4,A)","Okay, let's analyze the board.\n\n1.  **Reasoning:** We have three empty columns (H, I, J), which are very valuable. We also have a King (K♠) at the bottom of column D. Moving a King to an empty column is generally a good strategy, especially when it uncovers the card underneath (Q♦ in this case). This move frees up the Q♦ and utilizes an empty column effectively, potentially enabling further moves. There are no other immediately beneficial moves like building same-suit sequences. Moving K♠ from D to H is the most promising action.\n\n2.  **Answer:**\n    Answer: (D,5,H)","Reasoning: The only available legal move is to place the Jack of Diamonds (J♦) from column C onto the Queen of Diamonds (Q♦) in column G.

There are three empty columns (H, I, J) and a King (K♠) at the bottom of column D. Moving the King to an empty column is generally a good strategy because Kings can only be moved to empty columns. This move also reveals the card underneath the King (Q♦). Other moves involve moving non-King cards to empty columns, which also reveals hidden cards, but moving the King is often prioritized.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,H)","This move reveals a hidden card in column C and creates a small sequence (Q♦-J♦) in column G.

Making this move will reveal the hidden card in column C.\n\nAnswer: (C,5,G)","Reasoning: Moving the K♠ from column D to an empty column (H, I, or J) is the best move. This action accomplishes two important things: 1. It creates a valuable empty column, which increases maneuverability for future moves. 2. It flips the hidden card underneath the K♠ (the Q♦), potentially opening up new plays. Given that there are no more 'hit' opportunities, creating empty columns and revealing hidden cards are top priorities. Moving J♦ onto Q♦ first would only reveal 7♥, which has no immediate moves, and wouldn't create an empty column.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,H)","Reasoning: The only available move is to take the K♠ from column D and place it onto an empty column.

Columns E and F show face-up cards (4♦, 5♦) and (5♦, 8♦) respectively, from top to bottom. This ascending order is unusual for Spider Solitaire runs which must be descending.

There are no same-suit runs to move. There are no empty columns to move the King to. Since there are no legal moves and all columns have cards, the only available action is to deal new cards.\nAnswer: hit","Reasoning:\n1.  Moving Q♣ from column A onto K♣ in column D (Move A,6,D) reveals the card at A5 (J♠).\n2.  This move creates a sequence K♣-Q♣ on column D. While not same-suit, placing Queens on Kings is generally good.\n3.  Crucially, revealing J♠ at A5 enables a potential subsequent move: J♠ can be moved onto either Q♥ (at I5 or J5). This would uncover another card (A4) and also reveal the card under the chosen Q♥ (I4 or J4).\n4.  This sequence of plays uncovers more hidden cards compared to other immediate options like moving 5♥ to 6♥ (B,7,D), which only reveals one card (B6) and doesn't immediately set up a second move. Prioritizing moves that reveal multiple cards or enable further moves is key in Spider Solitaire.\n\nAnswer: (A,6,D)","**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Available Moves:** Examine potential moves based on the current face-up cards and game rules.\n    *   Identify movable runs (single cards or same-suit descending sequences).\n    *   Check valid destinations (top card of destination column must be one rank higher than the start of the run being moved).\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Moves:**\n    *   **Run 3♠-2♠ (B, index 4):** Needs a 4♠ top card. None available.\n    *   **Q♣ (A, index 5):** Needs K. Can move to K♣(D) or K♦(G). Both moves cover Kings, which hinders building sequences on those Kings later. Avoid unless necessary.\n    *   **5♥ (B, index 6):** Needs 6. No column topped by a 6.\n    *   **7♣ (C, index 5):** Needs 8. No column topped by an 8.\n    *   **K♣ (D, index 5):** Needs an empty column. None available.\n    *   **7♣ (E, index 5):** Needs 8. No column topped by an 8.\n    *   **9♦ (F, index 4):** Needs 10.

Avoid.\n3.  **Conclusion:** There are no constructive moves available. The only possible moves involve placing Queens onto Kings, which is generally a poor strategic choice early in the game as it blocks potential sequence building starting with those Kings. No moves create same-suit sequences or reveal hidden cards.\n4.  **Check 'Hit' Conditions:**\n    *   No good legal moves remain. (True)\n    *   Deck has cards (Hits remaining > 0).

(True)\n5.  **Decision:** Since there are no beneficial moves and the conditions for dealing new cards are met, the best action is to 'hit'.\n\nAnswer: hit","Reasoning: Moving the 2♦ from column B onto the 3♦ in column F is a valid move that reveals the hidden card K♥ underneath in column B. Revealing hidden cards, especially high-ranking ones like Kings, is crucial for opening up more potential moves and building sequences.\nAnswer: (B,11,F)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  Several moves allow building same-suit sequences: (E,9,G) J♠->Q♠, (G,7,B) 4♥->5♥, (H,9,D) or (H,9,J) Q♣->K♣, (I,9,G) 5♣->6♣, (J,10,D) or (J,10,F) 3♣->4♣.\n3.  All these moves also reveal a hidden card.\n4.  To prioritize which move to make, consider the number of hidden cards in the column being revealed. Revealing cards from columns with fewer hidden cards can sometimes lead to emptying a column faster.\n5.  Column G has 4 hidden cards (indices 0-3). Columns E, H, I, J each have 5 hidden cards.\n6.  Therefore, the move (G,7,B), which moves the 4♥ from column G onto the 5♥ in column B, is slightly preferable as it reveals a card in the column with the fewest hidden cards (G) while also building a same-suit sequence.\n\nAnswer: (G,7,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  Column D has a same-suit run: 5♦ 6♦ at index 8.\n3.  Column H has 7♦ at index 8.\n4.  Moving the 5♦ 6♦ run from D to H is a legal move (5♦ onto 7♦).\n5.  This move extends the diamond sequence to 5♦ 6♦ 7♦.\n6.  Crucially, this move will reveal the hidden card at D7.\n7.  Other potential moves like moving single cards (e.g., A♦ to 2♦, 3♦ to 2♦) reveal cards but don't build upon existing same-suit runs as effectively as this move does. Moving the 5♦ 6♦ run is preferable.\n\nAnswer: (D,8,H)","**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Goals:** The primary goals are to expose hidden cards, create empty columns, build same-suit sequences (especially starting from Kings), and ultimately clear K->A sequences. Hitting is not possible (0 hits left).\n2.  **Scan for Moves:** Systematically check all possible moves by looking at the bottom card\/run of each column and potential destinations.\n3.  **Evaluate Moves:**\n    *   Moving Kings to empty columns is high priority, but no Kings are currently free to move.\n    *   Moves that *free* a King (by moving the card(s) on top of it) are very valuable when an empty column exists (Column G is empty).\n        *   **(D,5,J):** Move 2♥ onto 3♥(J,7). Exposes K♣ at D,6. Allows K♣ -> G later. Builds 3♥-2♥.\n        *   **(J,5,B):** Move Q♥ onto K♥(B,10). Exposes K♣ at J,6. Allows K♣ -> G later. Builds K♥-Q♥.\n    *   Moves that build sequences starting from a King are also good.\n        *   **(I,7,G):** Move Q♦ onto K♦(G,4). Builds K♦-Q♦ in the empty column. Exposes 8♥ in I.\n    *   Moves that expose hidden cards are generally useful. Many such moves exist.\n4.  **Compare Top Moves:**\n    *   (J,5,B) and (D,5,J) both free a K♣. (J,5,B) builds K♥-Q♥, while (D,5,J) builds 3♥-2♥. Building on the K♥ seems slightly better, and it directly uses the K♥ at the bottom of column B.\n    *   (I,7,G) builds K♦-Q♦ using the empty column G immediately and exposes 8♥.\n    *   Comparing (J,5,B) and (I,7,G): Freeing the K♣ via (J,5,B) seems strategically stronger than immediately building K♦-Q♦ in the empty column G. Freeing the K♣ allows it to be moved to G in the next step, opening up column J further (exposing 3♥). This creates more flexibility than using G immediately for the K♦-Q♦ sequence.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Moving the Q♥ from column J onto the K♥ in column B (J,5,B) is the best move. It builds a valuable K♥-Q♥ sequence and, crucially, exposes the K♣ in column J, setting up a subsequent move of K♣ to the empty column G.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAnswer: (J,5,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to build K->A sequences.\n2.  There are no more 'hit' opportunities.\n3.  Several moves are possible. We should prioritize moves that reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences, especially starting from Kings.\n4.  Moving Q♥ from column I (index 5) onto K♥ in column B (index 10) achieves this. It creates a K♥-Q♥ sequence in column B, directly working towards a full sequence.\n5.  This move also reveals the card at (I, 4), which is 9♥. This could potentially allow building a 9♥-8♥ sequence later if the 8♥ currently at (I,6) becomes accessible or another 8♥ appears.\n6.  Other moves like (A, 8, F) reveal an Ace but don't start building from a King. Moves like (E, 5, F) or (H, 5, B) create shorter sequences lower down. Starting the King sequence seems strategically stronger.\n\nAnswer: (I,5,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit descending sequences (K->A).\n2.  There are no empty columns and no 'hit' available.\n3.  Several moves are possible that reveal a hidden card and build a sequence:\n    *   (D, 10, I): Move 4♣ onto 5♣. Reveals 6♦. Builds 5♣-4♣.\n    *   (E, 10, F) or (E, 10, I): Move 2♦ onto 3♦. Reveals J♠. Builds 3♦-2♦.\n    *   (F, 10, I): Move 2♦ onto 3♦. Reveals 3♦. Builds 3♦-2♦.\n    *   (I, 9, G): Move 5♣ onto 6♣. Reveals 3♦. Builds 6♣-5♣.\n    *   (J, 9, D): Move 3♣ onto 4♣. Reveals 2♦. Builds 4♣-3♣.\n4.  Comparing these options:\n    *   Moving 5♣ to 6♣ (I, 9, G) reveals 3♦ at I[8]. This creates an opportunity to potentially move one of the 2♦ cards (from E[10] or F[10]) onto this newly revealed 3♦ in the next step. This path seems promising for consolidating suits and revealing more cards (like the J♠ under the 2♦ at E[10]).\n    *   Moving 4♣ to 5♣ (D, 10, I) reveals 6♦, which can then potentially move onto 7♦, revealing another card. This is also a good sequence of moves.\n    *   Moving 2♦ from E (E, 10, F or I) reveals J♠ directly. Revealing higher-rank cards is generally good.\n5.  Choosing (I, 9, G) seems slightly better as it sets up a potential immediate follow-up move for a 2♦ onto the revealed 3♦, continuing the process of building runs and revealing cards.\n\nAnswer: (I,9,G)","Reasoning: Moving the 6♦ from column D onto the 7♦ in column H reveals the card beneath it (5♦). Importantly, this creates a [5♦, 6♦] run in column D, which can then be immediately moved onto the 7♦ in column H in the next step. This sequence of moves builds a longer same-suit run (potentially useful later) and reveals two hidden cards (D8 and D7). Other moves like placing a Q on K or J on Q are also good, but this sequence seems slightly better for revealing cards and building a run.\n\nAnswer: (D,9,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** The primary goal with no hits remaining is to expose hidden cards (XX) to reveal new potential moves. Secondary goals include building same-suit sequences and consolidating cards to eventually free up columns.\n2.  **Analyze Potential Moves:** Evaluate all possible single-card or same-suit run moves.\n3.  **Identify High-Priority Moves:** Moves that expose hidden cards are top priority. Other good moves consolidate sequences (especially K->Q, etc.) or enable further useful moves.\n4.  **Evaluate (J,5,B):**\n    *   Move Q♥ from column J (index 5) onto K♥ in column B (index 10).\n    *   This is a valid move (Q is one rank lower than K).\n    *   It builds towards a heart sequence (K♥, Q♥) on column B.\n    *   Critically, it exposes the 8♥ at index 4 in column J.\n5.  **Evaluate Consequences of (J,5,B):**\n    *   After (J,5,B), column J ends in 8♥.\n    *   Column E ends in 9♥.\n    *   This enables the move (J,4,E) on the *next* turn, moving the entire stack starting with 8♥ from J onto E.\n    *   The move (J,4,E) will expose the hidden card at J[3].\n6.  **Compare with Other Moves:**\n    *   (G,10,F): Moves 2♦ onto 3♦. Exposes 5♣ in G. This enables (D,10,G), but doesn't directly lead to exposing an XX card in one step.\n    *   (I,6,E): Moves 8♥ onto 9♥. Exposes Q♥ in I. Allows consolidating hearts further with (I,5,B), but doesn't expose an XX card as quickly as the sequence starting with (J,5,B).\n7.  **Conclusion:** Moving (J,5,B) is the best first step as it directly sets up a move (J,4,E) on the next turn that will expose a hidden card, which is the most valuable action given the current game state with no hits left.\n\nAnswer: (J,5,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Reveal hidden cards and create potential moves.\n2.  **Identify Moves:** Several moves are possible, including moving cards onto Kings (Q♣ to K♣, Q♦ to K♦) and consolidating suits (4♣ to 5♣, 3♣ to 4♣).\n3.  **Evaluate (F,10,I):** Moving 2♦ from column F (index 10) to column I (onto 3♦) reveals the 3♦ at F(9).\n4.  **Follow-up Potential:** This revealed 3♦ at F(9) can then be moved onto 4♣ (D,10) or 4♥ (H,5). Let's assume moving to D(10). This reveals the 8♣ at F(8).\n5.  **Further Follow-up:** This revealed 8♣ at F(8) can then be moved onto 9♣ (A,8). This reveals the card at F(7).\n6.  **Benefit:** The initial move (F,10,I) enables a sequence of moves that reveals three hidden cards (F9, F8, F7), significantly opening up the board. This is generally more valuable than moves that only reveal one card, even if those moves start building King sequences, as revealing cards provides more information and potential future moves.\n\nAnswer: (F,10,I)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify all possible moves.\n    *   (B9, 8♦, D7) -> Reveals B8 (A♠)\n    *   (C9, 2♣, J9) -> Reveals C8 (10♠), enables (C10, 9♠, C8)\n    *   (D9, 6♦, A7) -> Reveals D8 (5♦)\n    *   (D10, 4♣, G9) -> Reveals D9 (6♦), enables (D9, 6♦, A7)\n    *   (E9, J♠, G5) -> Reveals E8 (9♥), builds Q♠-J♠\n    *   (G9, 5♣, H8) -> Reveals G8 (6♣)\n    *   (H9, Q♣, D6) -> Reveals H8 (7♦), builds K♣-Q♣\n    *   (I9, 2♦, F9) -> Reveals I8 (3♦), builds 3♦-2♦\n    *   (J9, 3♣, F7) -> Reveals J8 (Q♦)\n2.  Evaluate the moves. All moves reveal a hidden card, which is good. Moves creating same-suit sequences (E->G, H->D, I->F) are valuable.\n3.  The move (C9, 2♣, J9) reveals 10♠ at C8. Since the card at C10 is 9♠, this immediately sets up the next move (C10, 9♠, C8) to form a 10♠-9♠ sequence within column C. Consolidating same-suit sequences in place is strategically very strong.\n4.  Comparing this to other good moves like (H9, Q♣, D6) or (E9, J♠, G5), the immediate potential for sequence building within the source column makes (C9, 2♣, J9) the slightly superior choice.\n5.  No 'hit' possible.\n\nAnswer: (C,9,J)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify potential moves by checking the bottom card of each column against the bottom cards of other columns.\n2.  Prioritize moves that uncover hidden cards, build same-suit sequences (especially starting from Kings), or free up Kings.\n3.  Several good moves exist:\n    *   (J,5,B): Move Q♥ onto K♥. This exposes K♣ in column J and builds towards a Heart sequence (K♥-Q♥) in column B. Exposing a King is valuable.\n    *   (C,9,J): Move 2♣ onto 3♣. Exposes 10♠ in C. Builds a small Club sequence (3♣-2♣).\n    *   (C,8,A) or (C,8,E): Move 10♠ onto J♠. Exposes A♥ in C. Builds a small Spade sequence (J♠-10♠).\n    *   (J,7,I): Move 8♥ onto 9♥. Exposes K♣ in J. Builds 9♥-8♥ sequence in I.\n4.  Comparing (J,5,B) and (J,7,I): Both expose K♣ in J. (J,5,B) starts building the K♥ sequence directly (K♥-Q♥), which is generally preferred over building a mid-rank sequence (9♥-8♥).\n5.  Comparing (J,5,B) with the moves from column C: Exposing K♣ seems slightly better than exposing 10♠ or A♥ at this stage, and building K♥-Q♥ is good progress.\n\nTherefore, moving Q♥ from column J to K♥ in column B is the best next step.\n\nAnswer: (J,5,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  There are no 'hit' chances remaining, so I must find a valid move.\n2.  Several moves are available that consolidate same-suit runs and reveal hidden cards.\n3.  Moving 6♠ from column H onto 7♠ in column F (H,7,F) achieves two goals:\n    *   It builds a same-suit sequence (6♠-7♠).\n    *   It reveals the card underneath in column H, which is J♦.\n4.  Revealing J♦ is particularly useful because there is a Q♦ available at the bottom of column I, allowing for a potential follow-up move (H,6,I) in the next turn to further consolidate the ♦ suit and reveal another card.\n\nAnswer: (H,7,F)","Reasoning: The best move is to consolidate same-suit runs where possible, prioritizing longer runs and revealing hidden cards. Moving the Q♥ from column J onto the K♥ in column B achieves this by creating a Q♥-K♥ sequence, the longest possible start to a suit sequence currently available. This move also reveals the card underneath the Q♥ in column J (index 4), which is an 8♥. This revealed 8♥ can potentially be moved onto the 9♥ in column I in a subsequent move, further advancing the game state.\n\nAnswer: (J,5,B)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards to reveal more options. Moving the 2♣ from column E to column J (onto the 3♣) will achieve this by flipping the card at E,3. While other moves exist, such as building short sequences like 7♥ on 8♥ (A,10,I or A,10,J) or Q♣ on K♣ (H,9,D or H,9,J), uncovering unknown cards is generally the most productive action when no empty columns or large sequence moves are available. Placing the 2♣ on the 3♣ in column J also creates a small same-suit sequence.\nAnswer: (E,4,J)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards, as no sequences can be completed and no 'hit' is available.

This is advantageous because the A♦ at A[9] can then be moved onto this 2♦ in the subsequent move (A,9,J).

Move is (H,8,B).\n    *   Moving 8♥ from I to E (onto 9♥) builds a 2-card sequence and reveals Q♦. Move is (I,6,E).\n    *   Moving 3♥ from J to G or H (onto 4♥) builds a 2-card sequence and reveals 2♦. Moves are (J,8,G) or (J,8,H).\n    *   Moving (6♣, 5♣) from G to C or E (onto 7♣) builds a 3-card sequence (7♣-6♣-5♣) and reveals 4♥.

Creates 3♦-2♦ sequence.\n\nMoves (H,9,D) and (H,9,J) both create a K♣-Q♣ sequence, which is strategically important for building a full K->A run. They also reveal the 7♦ in column H. Placing the Q♣ on the K♣ in column D (move H,9,D) seems slightly preferable to placing it in column J, as column D already has a mix of suits near the bottom. Starting a King sequence is a high priority.\n\nAnswer: (H,9,D)","Okay, let's analyze the board for the best move.\n\n1.  **Goal:** Reveal hidden cards, create empty columns (none possible yet), build same-suit sequences, move cards off lower-rank cards that are needed.\n2.  **Hidden Card Reveals:**\n    *   (D,3,A): Move 6♥ onto 7♥(A,10).

This reveals E,3 and places the 2♣ onto a same-suit card, potentially allowing the 3♣-2♣ sequence to move later. It also frees up 7♣(E,5).\n    *   (H,4,D) moves 3♣ from H to 4♣ on D. This reveals H,3 and places the 3♣ onto a same-suit card. It also frees up 4♥(H,6).\n    *   (D,3,A) moves 6♥ from D to 7♥ on A. This reveals D,2.\n    *   Comparing the reveal moves, (E,4,H) seems slightly preferable as it moves a low-rank card (2♣) onto its matching suit rank above it (3♣) and clears the way for the 7♣ above it.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,H)","Reasoning: The primary goal with no 'hit' actions remaining is to uncover hidden cards and consolidate sequences. Moving the 5♣ from column G onto the 6♣ in column H achieves both:\n1.  It uncovers the card at G,10 (which is Q♣).\n2.  It builds a same-suit sequence (6♣, 5♣) in column H.\n3.  This move enables a follow-up move: moving the 4♣ from D,10 onto the newly placed 5♣ in H, which would further build the sequence (6♣, 5♣, 4♣) and uncover the card at D,11 (3♣).\n\nAnswer: (G,9,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify possible moves. The main options are moving single cards to the empty column J, moving the 10♠ from C to E, moving the Q♥-8♥ run from I to B, or moving the 3♦-2♦ run from I to F.\n2.  Moving single cards to J reveals cards, with (B,9,J) revealing A♠ being the most promising single card move.\n3.  Moving 10♠ (C,8,E) reveals A♥ but covers 9♥.\n4.  Moving 3♦-2♦ (I,8,F) reveals Q♦ and builds a diamond sequence.\n5.  Moving Q♥-8♥ (I,5,B) reveals 9♥ and builds a heart sequence onto the K♥. This seems particularly strong because the revealed card (9♥) is the next card needed for the sequence above the moved cards (9♥ connects to the moved Q♥-8♥). It also clears cards from a long column (I) onto a King (B).\n\nComparing (I,5,B) and (I,8,F), both build same-suit sequences and reveal cards in column I. However, (I,5,B) builds onto a King and reveals the 9♥ which is immediately useful for the Q♥-8♥ sequence just moved. This appears to be the most strategically advantageous move.\n\nAnswer: (I,5,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  Analyze available same-suit moves that reveal hidden cards or build sequences.\n2.  Identify high-potential moves:\n    *   (J, 7, G\/H): Moves 3♥ -> 4♥, reveals K♣ in J, builds 2-card run.\n    *   (H, 9, D\/J): Moves Q♣ -> K♣, reveals 7♦ in H, builds 2-card run (K♣, Q♣).\n    *   (E, 9, G): Moves J♠ -> Q♠, reveals 9♥ in E, builds 2-card run (Q♠, J♠).\n    *   (G, 8, C\/E): Moves 6♣, 5♣ -> 7♣, reveals 4♥ in G, builds 3-card run (7♣, 6♣, 5♣).\n    *   (D, 10, G): Moves 4♣, 3♣ -> 5♣, reveals 6♦ in D, builds 4-card run (6♣, 5♣, 4♣, 3♣).\n3.  Compare the best options. Revealing a K is good, but the K♣ in J is only one card deep. Building longer sequences is generally better for consolidating columns and working towards K->A runs.\n4.  Move (D, 10, G) transfers a 2-card run (4♣, 3♣) onto the existing 5♣ in column G. This creates a 4-card sequence (6♣, 5♣, 4♣, 3♣) and reveals the 6♦ in column D. This combination of revealing a card and creating a long sequence seems the most advantageous.\n\nAnswer: (D,10,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  There are several possible moves that reveal a hidden card.\n3.  Moves that also build or extend same-suit sequences are generally preferred.\n4.  Moving 4♣ from column F onto 5♣ in column G (F,9,G) accomplishes both: it reveals the card at F[8] (3♦) and extends the club sequence in column G to 6♣-5♣-4♣.\n5.  Other good options include moving J♠ onto Q♠ (E,8,G), 2♦ onto 3♦ (I,7,F or J,7,F). However, building the longer 3-card sequence 6♣-5♣-4♣ seems slightly more beneficial at this stage.\n6.  No 'hit' is possible as the deck is empty.\n\nAnswer: (F,9,G)","Reasoning:\nThe main goal is to build K->A sequences. Several moves are possible:\n1.  (B,9,D): Move 8♦ onto 9♦. Exposes A♠. Creates 9♦-8♦ run.\n2.  (D,9,A) or (D,9,H): Move 6♦ onto 7♦. Exposes 5♦. Creates 7♦-6♦ run.\n3.  (G,9,H): Move 5♣ onto 6♣. Exposes 4♣. Creates 6♣-5♣ run.\n4.  (H,9,D) or (H,9,J): Move Q♣ onto K♣. Exposes 7♦. Creates K♣-Q♣ run.\n\nStarting a King sequence (move 4) is strategically the most valuable action towards the game goal. Moving the Q♣ from H onto the K♣ in D creates the K♣-Q♣ sequence and exposes the 7♦ underneath in column H. This seems preferable to exposing A♠ or building shorter, non-King sequences.\n\nAnswer: (H,9,D)","Reasoning: The best move currently is to consolidate same-suit runs to reveal hidden cards and build towards K->A sequences. Moving the 4♣, 3♣ run in column G (starting at index 10) onto the 5♣ (at index 9) in the same column achieves this. It creates a longer run (5♣, 4♣, 3♣) and reveals the card at index 8 in column G.\n\nAnswer: (G,10,G)","Reasoning: The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit descending sequences. Moving Q♣ from column H onto K♣ in column D creates a K♣-Q♣ sequence, which is a strong step towards completing a full suit. This move also reveals the card at H,8 (which is 7♦). Other moves like (I,9,F) or (D,9,A) also create same-suit sequences and reveal cards, but consolidating higher-ranked cards like K-Q is generally prioritized. Since no more cards can be dealt ('hit' is unavailable), making progress by uncovering cards and building sequences is essential.\n\nAnswer: (H,9,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify potential moves, focusing on revealing hidden cards and building sequences.\n2.  Moving the 2♦ from column J onto the 3♦ in column I (J,9,I) reveals the Q♣ at J8.\n3.  This revealed Q♣ can then be moved onto the K♣ in column D (J,8,D), revealing the 3♦ at J7.\n4.  Then, the 2♦ (now at I9) can be moved onto the newly revealed 3♦ at J7 (I,9,J), revealing the Q♦ at I8.\n5.  This sequence reveals three hidden cards (Q♣, 3♦, Q♦) in three moves, which is highly beneficial.\n6.  Other single moves, like moving Q cards onto K cards or consolidating shorter runs, only reveal one card initially.\n7.  Therefore, starting the sequence with (J,9,I) offers the best potential for progress.\n\nAnswer: (J,9,I)","Reasoning: The move (G,9,H) relocates the 5♣-4♣-3♣ run from column G onto the 6♣ in column H. This is beneficial because it creates a longer same-suit sequence (6♣ down to 3♣) in column H, which is a primary goal in Spider Solitaire. Additionally, this move will reveal the hidden card at index 8 in column G. Building longer same-suit sequences and uncovering hidden cards are key strategies.\n\nAnswer: (G,9,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  **Analyze Moves:** Several moves are possible.\n    *   `(J, 0, I)`: Moves 8♥ onto 9♥.

Reveals face-up 2♣ at C[6].\n    *   `(I, 9, I)` or `(J, 9, I)`: Moves 2♦ onto 3♦. Creates 3♦-2♦ sequence. Reveals Q♦ or 3♥.\n3.  **Compare Options:** Revealing hidden cards is crucial. Both (J, 0, I) and (G, 11, F) achieve this.\n    *   (G, 11, F) moves the 3♣ onto the 4♣ (F, 10). This creates a 4♣-3♣ run on column F. It also reveals the hidden card at the very bottom of column G.

The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build down same-suit sequences (K->A).\n2.  There are no more 'hit' opportunities available.\n3.  We need to find moves that rearrange cards to facilitate sequence building or expose hidden cards.\n4.  Empty columns I and J are available (D is technically empty but blocked by 6H at D[3]). Empty columns are valuable for maneuvering cards.\n5.  Consider moving the 2♦ from column H. It can go onto the 3♦ in column F or column I.\n6.  Moving 2♦ to 3♦ in column I (H,9,I) utilizes an empty column to start building a sequence (3♦, 2♦) and, crucially, exposes the Q♦ at H[8].\n7.  Exposing the Q♦ is highly beneficial, as it can potentially be moved onto the K♦ in column G later, furthering a K->A sequence.\n8.  Other moves like (H,6,G) moving (Q♦, J♦) onto K♦ are also good, but starting the 3♦-2♦ sequence in an empty column and revealing the Q♦ first seems strategically sound for enabling future moves.\n\nAnswer: (H,9,I)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.

Building same-suit sequences is also beneficial.\n2.  **Identify Potential Moves:** Scan each column's face-up cards for possible moves.\n3.  **Prioritize Moves:**\n    *   Moves that empty a column are highly valuable because an empty column can accept any card or sequence, significantly increasing flexibility.\n    *   Moves that reveal hidden cards are the main way to progress without hits.\n    *   Moves that build same-suit sequences help towards clearing columns.\n4.  **Evaluate Top Candidates:**\n    *   (E, 0, H): Moves 2♣ to H (onto 3♣). Empties column E, revealing a hidden card. Good.\n    *   (H, 0, J): Moves 3♣ to J (onto 4♣). Empties column H, revealing a hidden card. Good.\n    *   (J, 0, E): Moves 8♥ to E (onto 9♥). Empties column J, revealing a hidden card, *and* builds a same-suit sequence (8♥-9♥). Excellent.\n    *   Other moves reveal cards but don't empty columns or build sequences as effectively right now. For example, (I, 2, E) builds 8♥-9♥ but only reveals Q♥, not a hidden card. (I, 5, F) builds 2♦-3♦ but only reveals 3♦. (J, 1, B) builds Q♥-K♥ but only reveals 8♥.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Moving the 8♥ from column J to column E (onto the 9♥) achieves three objectives simultaneously: it empties column J (revealing a hidden card), creates a valuable empty column, and progresses a same-suit sequence (Hearts). This is the most advantageous move available.\n\nAnswer: (J,0,E)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Uncover hidden cards and build sequences. No 'hit' is available.\n2.  **Identify potential moves:**\n    *   (D,9,H): Move 6♦ (D9) onto 7♦ (H8). This is a valid same-suit move. It would uncover the card at D8.\n    *   (I,8,G): Move Q♦, 3♦, 2♦ (I8-I10) onto K♦ (G3). This is valid. It would uncover the card at I7.\n    *   (J,7,H): Move 3♥ (J7) onto 4♥ (H6). This is valid. It would uncover the card at J6.\n3.  **Evaluate moves:**\n    *   (D,9,H) reveals the card at D8 (which is 5♦). This 5♦ can then be immediately moved onto the 6♦ at H9, revealing another card (D7 - 9♦). This sequence reveals two cards.\n    *   (I,8,G) moves a 3-card sequence (Q♦, 3♦, 2♦) under its K♦. This is good for consolidation but only reveals one card (I7 - Q♦).\n    *   (J,7,H) builds a small 2-card sequence (4♥, 3♥) and reveals one card (J6 - K♣).\n4.  **Conclusion:** The move (D,9,H) is preferred because it directly enables a subsequent move (D,8,H) that reveals a second hidden card. Uncovering hidden cards is the highest priority when no hits are left.\n\nAnswer: (D,9,H)","Reasoning: The most promising move is to consolidate the Heart sequence. Moving the Q♥, 8♥ run from column I onto the K♥ in column B builds towards a K-A sequence (K♥, Q♥, 8♥). This action also reveals the card underneath the run in column I (which is Q♦), potentially opening up new moves.\n\nAnswer: (I,5,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify potential moves: Check which bottom cards or same-suit runs can be moved onto other bottom cards.\n    *   J♠ (A5) can move onto Q♠ (G5). -> Reveals XX at A4.\n    *   6♦-5♦ (D8-D9) can move onto 7♦ (A7 or H8). Moving to A7 (D,8,A) reveals K♣ at D6. Moving to H8 (D,8,H) reveals K♣ at D6.\n    *   6♣-5♣-4♣-3♣ (G8-G11) can move onto 7♣ (C6 or E5). Moving to C6 (G,8,C) reveals 4♥ at G7. Moving to E5 (G,8,E) reveals 4♥ at G7.\n    *   3♥ (J7) can move onto 4♥ (G7 or H5). Moving to G7 (J,7,G) reveals K♣ at J6. Moving to H5 (J,7,H) reveals K♣ at J6.\n\n2.  Evaluate the moves:\n    *   (A,5,G): Reveals a hidden card. Creates Q♠-J♠ sequence.\n    *   (D,8,A) or (D,8,H): Reveals K♣. Creates 7♦-6♦-5♦ sequence.\n    *   (G,8,C) or (G,8,E): Reveals 4♥. Creates a long 7♣-6♣-5♣-4♣-3♣ sequence. This significantly progresses towards clearing a suit.\n    *   (J,7,G) or (J,7,H): Reveals K♣. Creates 4♥-3♥ sequence.\n\n3.  Choose the best move: Moving the long 6♣ run (G,8,C or G,8,E) is the most productive move. It creates the longest same-suit sequence (5 cards), advancing the goal significantly, and reveals the 4♥ underneath. Moving to C seems slightly preferable as column C is longer, but either is good. Let's choose (G,8,C).\n\nAnswer: (G,8,C)","Reasoning:\n1.  Goal is to reveal hidden cards and build sequences.\n2.  Moving J♠ from E(10) onto Q♠ at G(5) is a valid move (same suit, descending rank).\n3.  This move reveals the card at E(10), which is A♠. Revealing an Ace is generally very beneficial.\n4.  It also creates a Q♠-J♠ sequence in column G.\n5.  Column E has only 4 hidden cards remaining after this move, bringing it closer to being cleared or revealing more useful cards.\n6.  Other potential moves, like moving Q♥ to K♥ or Q♣ to K♣, build sequences but reveal cards (8♥, K♣, 7♦) that seem less immediately impactful than revealing an Ace from a shallow column.\n\nAnswer: (E,10,G,5)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to build K->A sequences and uncover hidden cards. No 'hit' is available.\n2.  Several moves are possible: (D,5,J), (E,5,F), (G,6,C), (H,5,B), (I,6,A), (I,6,E), (J,5,B).\n3.  Each move uncovers one card. We should prioritize moves that build same-suit sequences or enable further moves.\n4.  Moving Q♥ from J[5] onto K♥ at B[10] using `(J,5,B)` directly builds towards a K♥ sequence (K♥, Q♥).\n5.  This move uncovers J[4], which is 8♥.\n6.  This newly revealed 8♥ can potentially be moved onto the 9♥ at A[4] or E[8] in subsequent moves, leading to further uncovering of cards (e.g., A[3] or E[7]) and building another heart sequence (9♥, 8♥).\n7.  Other moves like (I,6,A) or (I,6,E) would move 8♥ onto 9♥ first, uncovering Q♥ at I[5], which could then move to K♥ at B[10]. This sequence achieves a similar result but moving the Q♥ directly onto the K♥ seems slightly more direct.\n8.  Therefore, (J,5,B) is chosen as it makes immediate progress on a K-sequence and enables likely follow-up moves.\n\nAnswer: (J,5,B)","Reasoning:\nThe primary goal is to reveal hidden cards. Several moves achieve this while also building same-suit sequences.\n- (D, 9, A) or (D, 9, H): Moves 6♦ onto 7♦, reveals 5♦ in D.\n- (E, 9, G): Moves J♠ onto Q♠, reveals 9♥ in E.\n- (G, 9, H): Moves 5♣ onto 6♣, reveals 6♣ in G.\n- (H, 9, D) or (H, 9, J): Moves Q♣ onto K♣, reveals 7♦ in H.\n- (I, 9, F): Moves 2♦ onto 3♦, reveals Q♣ in I.\n- (J, 10, G): Moves 4♣ onto 5♣, reveals 2♦ in J.\n\nAll these are good moves. Moving J♠ from E to G (E, 9, G) consolidates the Q♠ and J♠ in column G, which already contains 9♠ further down, potentially helping build a spade sequence later. It also reveals the 9♥ in column E. This seems like a marginally better strategic choice among several good options.\n\nAnswer: (E,9,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal with no 'hit' options remaining is to reveal hidden cards to open up possibilities.\n2.  Moves that reveal cards higher up in the columns (lower index) are generally preferred.\n3.  Moves that consolidate same-suit runs are also beneficial.\n4.  Several moves reveal hidden cards. Let's evaluate some promising ones:\n    *   `(I,5,B)`: Moves Q♥ onto K♥. Reveals I(4). Builds K♥-Q♥. Good.\n    *   `(J,5,B)`: Moves Q♥ onto K♥. Reveals J(4). Builds K♥-Q♥. Good.\n    *   `(H,4,G)`: Moves 3♣ onto 4♣. Reveals H(3). Builds 4♣-3♣. Very good (reveals index 3).\n    *   `(E,4,G)`: Moves 2♣ onto 3♣. Reveals E(3). Builds 3♣-2♣ onto the existing 5♣-4♣ in column G, creating a 5♣-4♣-3♣-2♣ run. Very good (reveals index 3 and builds a long run).\n5.  Comparing `(H,4,G)` and `(E,4,G)`, both reveal a card at index 3. However, `(E,4,G)` builds a longer same-suit sequence (potentially 4 cards long) in column G by moving the 2♣ onto the existing 3♣ (which is below 4♣ and 5♣). This seems slightly more advantageous for future consolidation or completion.\n\nTherefore, moving the 2♣ from column E to column G is the best move.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,G)","Okay, let's analyze the board. The highest priority with no 'hit' chances remaining is to reveal hidden cards ('XX').\n\n1.  **Check moves that reveal hidden cards:**\n    *   Moving the stack `4♣, 8♣, 3♦` from column F (starting at index 4) onto the `5♣` in column G (index 9) is a valid move (`4♣` onto `5♣`). This move will reveal the card at index 3 in column F, which is currently hidden ('XX').\n\n2.  **Check other moves (that only reveal known cards):**\n    *   `(A,10,J)`: `7♥` onto `8♥`.

Builds `7♦, 6♦`.\n    *   `(G,10,I)`: `2♦` onto `3♦`. Reveals `5♣` at G9. Builds `3♦, 2♦`.\n    *   `(H,9,D)` or `(H,9,J)`: `Q♣` onto `K♣`. Reveals `7♦` at H8. Consolidates Kings.\n    *   `(I,10,F)`: `2♦` onto `3♦`. Reveals `3♦` at I9. Builds `3♦, 2♦`.\n    *   `(J,7,G)`: `3♥` onto `4♥`. Reveals `K♣` at J6. Builds `4♥, 3♥`.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The move `(F,4,G)` is the only one that directly exposes a hidden card.

Columns I and J both have Q♥ at their bottoms (index 5).\n2.  Moving Q♥ onto K♥ progresses this goal directly.\n3.  Let's compare moving Q♥ from I vs J:\n    *   Moving (I,5,B) reveals 8♥ at I(6). This 8♥ can then move onto 9♥ at E(8).\n    *   Moving (J,5,B) reveals 8♥ at J(6). This 8♥ can also move onto 9♥ at E(8). After that, J(7) has 3♥, which can move onto 4♥ at H(8).\n4.  Moving Q♥ from J seems slightly better because it potentially uncovers more playable cards in the subsequent moves (reveals 8♥, then potentially 3♥). Starting the K♥ sequence build is a high priority.\n\nAnswer: (J,5,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify potential moves: Several moves are possible, including moving single cards or short runs.\n2.  Prioritize moves that build sequences on Kings: Moving Q♥ to K♥ is highly desirable. There are two Q♥ available (I,5 and J,5) and one K♥ (B,10).\n3.  Evaluate Q♥ moves:\n    *   `(I,5,B)`: Moves Q♥ from I onto K♥ in B. This creates a K♥-Q♥ sequence and reveals the card at I,6 (8♥).\n    *   `(J,5,B)`: Moves Q♥ from J onto K♥ in B. This creates a K♥-Q♥ sequence and reveals the card at J,6 (Q♦).\n4.  Compare revealed cards: Revealing 8♥ (from `(I,5,B)`) seems slightly more beneficial immediately, as there is a 7♥ visible in column A which could potentially move onto this 8♥ later.\n5.  Other potential moves like `(G,8,C)` (moving 6♣-5♣ to 7♣) or `(C,10,C)` (moving 9♠ to 10♠) build sequences but don't start from a King. Starting the K♥ sequence takes priority.\n6.  Conclusion: Moving the Q♥ from column I to column B is the best move as it starts building a sequence on a King and reveals a potentially useful card (8♥).\n\nAnswer: (I,5,B)","Reasoning: The move (I,5,B) places the Q♥ onto the K♥, progressing towards completing a heart sequence. This move also reveals the card at index I,4, which is crucial for gaining more information and enabling future moves. Other good moves exist, like (I,7,G) or (H,9,D), but moving the Q♥ seems slightly better as it builds on the K♥ and uncovers a card in column I.\n\nAnswer: (I,5,B)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  **Hits:** No hits remaining (0). Must make a move.\n3.  **Options:** Several moves are available that build same-suit sequences and reveal a hidden card:\n    *   (A, 10, I): Moves 7♥ onto 8♥(I,6), reveals A♦(A,9). Builds 9♥-8♥-7♥.\n    *   (C, 10, C): Moves 9♠ onto 10♠(C,8), reveals 2♣(C,9). Builds 10♠-9♠.\n    *   (D, 9, A): Moves 6♦ onto 7♦(A,7), reveals 5♦(D,8). Builds 7♦-6♦.\n    *   (D, 9, H): Moves 6♦ onto 7♦(H,8), reveals 5♦(D,8). Builds 7♦-6♦.\n    *   (E, 9, G): Moves J♠ onto Q♠(G,5), reveals 9♥(E,8). Builds Q♠-J♠.\n    *   (G, 9, H): Moves 5♣ onto 6♣(H,8), reveals 2♦(G,10). Builds 6♣-5♣.\n    *   (H, 9, D): Moves Q♣ onto K♣(D,6), reveals 7♦(H,8). Builds K♣-Q♣.\n    *   (H, 9, J): Moves Q♣ onto K♣(J,6), reveals 7♦(H,8). Builds K♣-Q♣.\n    *   (I, 9, I): Moves 2♦ onto 3♦(I,8), reveals Q♦(I,7). Builds 3♦-2♦.\n4.  **Best Choice:** Moving the Q♣ (H,9) onto a K♣ (D,6 or J,6) makes progress towards completing a full sequence, which is the ultimate goal. Both options reveal 7♦ in column H. Let's choose placing it on the K♣ in column D. This consolidates Club cards.\n\nAnswer: (H,9,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  **No 'hit' available:** We must find a move on the board. The priority is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  **Identify promising moves:** Several moves reveal hidden cards and create or extend same-suit sequences:\n    *   (E,9,G): Move J♠ onto Q♠. Reveals E[8]. Builds Q♠, J♠.\n    *   (H,9,D): Move Q♣ onto K♣. Reveals H[8]. Builds K♣, Q♣.\n    *   (H,9,J): Move Q♣ onto K♣. Reveals H[8]. Builds K♣, Q♣.\n    *   (I,9,F): Move 2♦ onto 3♦. Reveals I[8]. Builds 3♦, 2♦.\n    *   (J,9,G): Move 3♥ onto 4♥. Reveals J[8]. Builds 4♥, 3♥.\n    *   (J,9,H): Move 3♥ onto 4♥. Reveals J[8]. Builds 4♥, 3♥.\n    *   (G,11,F): Move 3♣ onto 4♣. Reveals G[10]. Builds 4♣, 3♣.\n    *   (A,10,J): Move 7♥ onto 8♥. Reveals A[9]. Builds 8♥, 7♥.\n3.  **Evaluate best moves:** Building onto Kings is generally good as it starts potential K->A sequences. Moves (H,9,D) and (H,9,J) both move Q♣ onto K♣, revealing H[8] and creating a K♣, Q♣ sequence. Both targets (D[6]=K♣, J[6]=K♣) are valid. Column D has fewer hidden cards than column J (5 vs 6), making it a slightly preferable target to potentially clear sooner.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Moving Q♣ from H to D reveals a card and builds the valuable K♣, Q♣ sequence.\n\nAnswer: (H,9,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  Check available moves:\n    *   (D,9,H): 6♦ on 7♦. Reveals D[8]=5♦.\n    *   (E,9,G): J♠ on Q♠. Reveals E[8]=9♥.\n    *   (G,10,I): 2♦ on 3♦. Reveals G[9]=5♣.\n    *   (G,10,F): 2♦ on 3♦. Reveals G[9]=5♣.\n    *   (H,10,G): 4♣ on 5♣. Reveals H[9]=Q♣.\n    *   (I,9,F): 2♦ on 3♦. Reveals I[8]=3♦.\n2.  Evaluate moves:\n    *   Moves revealing cards are generally good. All listed moves reveal a card.\n    *   Moves creating same-suit sequences are preferred. (E,9,G) creates Q♠-J♠. (D,9,H) creates 7♦-6♦. (G,10,I\/F) creates 3♦-2♦. (H,10,G) creates 5♣-4♣. (I,9,F) creates 3♦-2♦.\n    *   Consider follow-up moves:\n        *   If (D,9,H) is made, D reveals 5♦. Then (D,8,H) becomes possible (5♦ on 6♦), revealing D[7]=9♦. This chain reveals two cards and builds a diamond sequence.\n        *   If (H,10,G) is made, H reveals Q♣. Then (H,9,D) becomes possible (Q♣ on K♣), revealing H[8]=7♦. This chain also reveals two cards and starts building a club sequence on a King.\n3.  Compare follow-up chains: Both chains seem beneficial. Building onto the K♣ with the Q♣ (Chain starting H,10,G) seems slightly more advantageous as it directly progresses towards clearing a K-A sequence and uses the revealed card immediately in a strong position.\n\nTherefore, the best first move is (H,10,G).\n\nAnswer: (H,10,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Identify potential moves:** Several moves are possible, involving either single cards or same-suit runs.\n    *   Run `10♠-9♠` (C,9) can move to `J♠` (E,9). -> (C,9,E)\n    *   Run `6♦-5♦` (D,8) can move to `7♦` (A,7). -> (D,8,A)\n    *   Run `6♣-5♣` (G,9) can move to `7♣` (C,6 or E,5). -> (G,9,C) or (G,9,E)\n    *   Single `J♠` (E,9) can move to `Q♠` (G,5). -> (E,9,G)\n    *   Single `4♣` (H,10) can move to `5♣` (G,9). -> (H,10,G)\n    *   Other single card moves are also possible (`7♥`, `2♦`, `3♥`).\n2.  **Evaluate moves:** The primary goals are to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Moves that enable further sequence building are preferable, especially with no hits left and limited turns.\n    *   `(C,9,E)` builds `J♠-10♠-9♠`, reveals `A♥` in C. Enables moving the 3-card run to `Q♠` later.\n    *   `(D,8,A)` builds `7♦-6♦-5♦`, reveals `9♦` in D. Enables moving the 3-card run to `8♦` (B,8) next, creating a 4-card run and revealing `J♠`.\n    *   `(G,9,E)` builds `7♣-6♣-5♣`, reveals `4♥` in G. Less obvious immediate follow-up for the run itself.\n    *   `(H,10,G)` builds `5♣-4♣`, reveals `Q♣` in H. Reveals a high card, which is good, but builds a shorter sequence.\n3.  **Choose the best move:** Comparing `(C,9,E)` and `(D,8,A)`, both build 3-card sequences and enable building 4-card sequences next turn. `(D,8,A)` reveals `9♦` initially (less likely to block than `A♥` from `(C,9,E)`) and the follow-up move reveals a `J♠`. This path seems slightly more advantageous for progressing the game by consolidating the diamond suit and revealing useful cards.\n\nAnswer: (D,8,A)","Reasoning:\n1.  Analyze available moves: Identify all possible card\/sequence movements between columns.\n2.  Prioritize moves that reveal hidden cards. All potential moves listed below reveal a card.\n3.  Prioritize moves that build longer same-suit sequences.\n4.  Consider the rank of the revealed card (Aces and Kings are often valuable).\n5.  Evaluate key moves:\n    *   (A,11,H): Moves 6♦-5♦ onto 7♦. Reveals 7♥. Builds 7♦-6♦-5♦ (length 3).\n    *   (C,8,F): Moves 10♠-9♠ onto J♠. Reveals A♥. Builds J♠-10♠-9♠ (length 3).\n    *   (F,9,G) or (F,9,I): Moves 3♦ onto 2♦. Reveals J♠. Builds 3♦-2♦ (length 2).\n    *   (I,8,G): Moves 3♦ onto 2♦. Reveals Q♦. Builds 3♦-2♦ (length 2).\n    *   (H,10,G): Moves 4♣-3♣ onto 5♣. Reveals Q♣. Builds 5♣-4♣-3♣ (length 3).\n    *   (J,7,G): Moves 3♥ onto 4♥. Reveals K♣. Builds 4♥-3♥ (length 2).\n\n6.  Compare best options:\n    *   Move (C,8,F) reveals an Ace (A♥) and builds a length 3 sequence. The revealed A♥ can potentially receive the 2♥ from column D.\n    *   Move (H,10,G) reveals a Queen (Q♣) and builds a length 3 sequence.\n    *   Move (J,7,G) reveals a King (K♣) but only builds a length 2 sequence.\n    *   Move (A,11,H) reveals 7♥ and builds a length 3 sequence.\n\n7.  Conclusion: Move (C,8,F) is the strongest as it reveals an Ace, builds a length 3 sequence, and potentially sets up a subsequent move (moving 2♥ onto the revealed A♥).\n\nAnswer: (C,8,F)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Identify Potential Moves**: Scan the bottom card of each column to find possible moves onto other columns.\n    *   A(5♦) -> None (needs 6♦)\n    *   B(8♦) -> D(9♦) or I(9♦)\n    *   C(2♣) -> H(3♣) or J(3♣)\n    *   D(K♣-9♦) -> Needs empty column\n    *   E(A♠-J♠) -> G(Q♠)\n    *   F(4♣-8♣-3♦) -> Needs 4♦\n    *   G(5♣) -> H(6♣)\n    *   H(7♦-Q♣) -> D(K♣) or J(K♣)\n    *   I(2♦) -> F(3♦)\n    *   J(3♥) -> B(4♥) or G(4♥)\n2.  **Evaluate Moves**: Prioritize moves that reveal hidden cards, build same-suit sequences, or open up columns.\n    *   (B,9,D) or (B,9,I): Reveals A♠ (B,8). Good.\n    *   (C,9,H) or (C,9,J): Reveals 10♠ (C,8). Good. (C,9,H) builds 3♣-2♣.\n    *   (E,8,G): Reveals 9♥ (E,7). Builds Q♠-J♠ (but A♠ is below J♠).\n    *   (G,9,H): Reveals 2♦ (G,8). Builds 6♣-5♣ sequence. Very good.\n    *   (H,8,D) or (H,8,J): Reveals 6♠ (H,7). Good.\n    *   (I,9,F): Reveals 3♦ (I,8). Builds 3♦-2♦ sequence. Very good.\n    *   (J,7,B) or (J,7,G): Reveals Q♦ (J,6). Builds 4♥-3♥ sequence. Very good.\n3.  **Select Best Move**: Moves (G,9,H), (I,9,F), and (J,7,B\/G) are strong candidates as they reveal cards and build same-suit sequences. Moving 3♥ from J to B (or G) reveals a Q♦, which could potentially receive the J♦ from column H. This seems slightly better than the other options as it reveals a higher-rank card and potentially enables another move soon. Let's choose (J,7,B).\n\nAnswer: (J,7,B)","Reasoning:\nThe goal is to build sequences and reveal hidden cards. There are no hits left.\nSeveral moves are possible that build same-suit sequences and\/or reveal cards:\n1.  (A,11,H): Moves 6♦ 5♦ onto 7♦. Reveals 7♥ on A. Builds 7♦ 6♦ 5♦.\n2.  (E,10,I): Moves 2♦ onto 3♦. Reveals J♠ on E. Builds 3♦ 2♦.\n3.  (F,10,G): Moves 4♣ onto 5♣. Reveals 3♦ on F. Builds 5♣ 4♣.\n4.  (G,11,F): Moves 3♣ onto 4♣. Reveals 5♣ on G. Builds 4♣ 3♣.\n5.  (H,10,I): Moves 2♦ onto 3♦. Reveals Q♣ on H. Builds 3♦ 2♦.\n6.  (H,9,J): Moves Q♣ onto K♣. Reveals 7♦ on H. Builds K♣ Q♣.\n7.  (J,7,H): Moves 3♥ onto 4♥. Reveals K♣ on J. Builds 4♥ 3♥.\n\nMoving Q♣ to K♣ (H,9,J) is a strong move because:\n- It reveals a hidden card (7♦ on H).\n- It builds a high-value same-suit sequence (K♣ Q♣ on J), potentially progressing towards clearing a sequence.\n\nAnswer: (H,9,J)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goals are to reveal hidden cards and build K->A sequences.\n2.  There's an empty column (D), which is valuable for maneuvering cards, especially Kings.\n3.  Moving a King to the empty column D is a strong strategic move. Available Kings are K♥ (B,10), K♦ (G,4), and K♣ (J,6).\n4.  Moving K♦ from G to D via `(G, 4, D)` reveals 7♠ in column G. The K♦ in column D can then potentially receive the J♦ from column H later via `(H, 6, D)`, creating a K♦-J♦ sequence and revealing 6♠ in H.\n5.  Moving K♣ from J to D via `(J, 6, D)` reveals Q♦ in column J. The K♣ in column D could then receive the Q♣ from column H later via `(H, 9, D)`, creating a K♣-Q♣ sequence and revealing 7♦ in H.\n6.  Comparing the follow-up potential, creating a K♦-J♦ sequence (option 4) seems slightly better than K♣-Q♣ (option 5) as it involves revealing potentially useful spade cards (7♠ and 6♠).\n7.  Other moves like `(H, 9, J)` (moving Q♣ to K♣) or `(F, 9, G)` (moving 3♦ to 4♦) are possible and reveal cards, but utilising the empty column D with a King is generally a more powerful maneuver for long-term arrangement.\n8.  Therefore, moving the K♦ seems the best initial step.\n\nAnswer: (G,4,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  Moving the 8♦ from column B to the 9♦ in column D (B,9,D) will expose the face-down card at B(8), which is an A♠. Revealing Aces is generally a high priority.\n2.  This move also starts building a sequence in column D (9♦-8♦).\n3.  After this move, the 7♦ in column H can be moved onto the 8♦ in column D (H,9,D), revealing the card at H(8) (Q♣) and extending the sequence to 9♦-8♦-7♦.\n4.  Following that, the 6♦-5♦ run from column A can be moved onto the 7♦ in column D (A,11,D), revealing the card at A(10) (7♥) and creating a long 9♦-8♦-7♦-6♦-5♦ sequence in column D.\nThis chain of moves reveals three cards (A♠, Q♣, 7♥) and significantly consolidates the diamond suit, making it the most promising sequence of actions. Other moves like (G,8,C) or (I,9,F) build sequences and reveal cards, but revealing the A♠ first seems strategically stronger.\n\nAnswer: (B,9,D)","Reasoning: Moving the 6♦-5♦ run from column A to the 7♦ in column H is beneficial because it consolidates cards of the same suit into a longer descending sequence (7♦-6♦-5♦). This action also reveals the hidden card at A[10]. Building same-suit sequences and revealing hidden cards are key objectives, especially with no 'hit' chances remaining.\n\nAnswer: (A,11,H)","Reasoning: The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build sequences.\n1.  Moving 2♦ from column G to 3♦ in column F (G,10,F) reveals the card at G[9] (5♣). This immediately forms a playable sequence (6♣-5♣) in column G and creates a 3♦-2♦ sequence in column F.\n2.  Moving 6♦-5♦ from column A to 7♦ in column H (A,11,H) reveals A[10] (7♥) and creates a longer sequence (7♦-6♦-5♦). This is also a good move.\n3.  Moving 8♦ from column B to 9♦ in column D (B,9,D) reveals B[8] (A♠). Revealing Aces is important but can sometimes block progress temporarily.\n4.  Moving 2♦ from column I to 3♦ in column F (I,9,F) reveals I[8] (3♦), creating a Q♦-3♦ sequence and a 3♦-2♦ sequence.\n\nComparing (G,10,F) and (A,11,H), move (G,10,F) seems slightly better as it reveals 5♣ under 6♣, immediately creating a movable sequence within column G, while also consolidating diamonds in F.\n\nAnswer: (G,10,F)","This move builds a longer same-suit sequence, which is generally a good strategy in Spider Solitaire. It moves the 9♠-10♠ run from column C onto the J♠ in column E, creating a 9♠-T♠-J♠ sequence and revealing the card underneath the 9♠ in column C.\n\nAnswer: (C,9,E)","Reasoning:\n1.  Goal is to build K->A sequences and reveal hidden cards.\n2.  Consider moves that build same-suit sequences or reveal potentially useful cards (like Queens for Kings).\n3.  Moving the 3♦-2♦ sequence from column I (starting at index 8) onto the 4♥ in column H (index 5) is possible: `(I,8,H)`.\n4.  This move reveals the card at I[7], which is Q♦.\n5.  This revealed Q♦ can then be moved onto the K♦ in column G (index 4) in the subsequent move: `(I,7,G)`.\n6.  This sequence of moves reveals two cards (Q♦ and then I[6]) and starts building a K♦ sequence, which is a high-priority objective.\n7.  Alternative good moves like `(A,11,H)` (moving 6♦-5♦ onto 7♦) build longer same-suit sequences initially, but revealing the Q♦ and placing it on K♦ seems more strategically advantageous at this stage.\n\nAnswer: (I,8,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards and build sequences, especially K->A sequences. Hitting is not possible.\n2.  **Identify Potential Moves:** Several moves are possible, including moving 8♦ (B) to 9♦ (D or I), 2♣ (C) to 3♣ (H or J), J♠ (E) to Q♠ (G), 2♦ (G or J) to 3♦ (F or I), 5♣ (H) to 6♣ (G), and Q♣ (I) to K♣ (D or J).\n3.  **Evaluate High-Value Moves:**\n    *   Moving a Queen onto a King starts building towards a full sequence. Options are (I,9,D) moving Q♣ to K♣ and (I,9,J) moving Q♣ to K♣.\n    *   Moving (I,9,D) places Q♣ onto K♣ in column D. This uncovers the card at I[8] and makes the 9♦ at D[7] available to move.\n    *   Moving (I,9,J) places Q♣ onto K♣ in column J. This uncovers the card at I[8] and makes the 3♥ at J[7] available to move.\n4.  **Assess Follow-up Moves:**\n    *   If we make move (I,9,D), the 9♦ at D[7] becomes the bottom card. It can then be moved onto the 10♠ at C[8] via move (D,7,C). This second move would uncover the K♣ at D[6]. This sequence of moves uncovers two cards (I[8] and D[6]) and builds two potentially useful sequences (K♣-Q♣ and 10♠-9♦).\n    *   If we make move (B,9,D), placing 8♦ on 9♦, we uncover the card at B[8] (which is A♠) and free the K♣ at D[6]. While freeing a King and uncovering an Ace is good, the King cannot move immediately (no empty columns), and the A♠ also has no immediate move.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The move (I,9,D) enables a beneficial follow-up move (D,7,C), leading to uncovering two hidden cards and consolidating sequences. This seems more productive than other available single moves.\n\nAnswer: (I,9,D)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards to reveal more options. Moving the J♠ from column A onto the Q♠ in column G (A,5,1,G) will reveal the hidden card at A(4). This is generally the most beneficial type of move when available.\n\nAnswer: (A,5,G)","This move builds a same-suit sequence (K♣ Q♣) which is a primary goal in Spider Solitaire. It also reveals a hidden card (7♦ in column H), opening up potential future moves.\n\nAnswer: (H,9,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  Identify all legal moves. Several are possible, including moving runs or single cards.\n2.  Prioritize moves that reveal hidden cards, consolidate same-suit sequences, or open up empty columns (none possible here).\n3.  Moving the 3♣-4♣ run from column G (indices 10-11) onto the 5♣ in column H (index 8) consolidates clubs into a 5♣-4♣-3♣ sequence.\n4.  This move reveals the card at G,9 (which is 2♦).\n5.  Building longer same-suit sequences is generally a good strategy. Other moves like (A,11,H) or (H,9,D) are also good, but consolidating the clubs seems slightly better.\n\nAnswer: (G,10,H)","Reasoning: The best move is to place the Q♣ from column H onto the K♣ in column D. This builds a same-suit sequence (K♣-Q♣), which is crucial for eventually clearing the column. This move also reveals the card at H[8] (7♦), potentially opening up new moves. Other moves might reveal cards or build shorter sequences, but building directly onto a King is usually a high priority.\nAnswer: (H,9,D)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build sequences. We cannot deal new cards ('hit').\n2.  Moving the 6♦ 5♦ run from column A onto the 7♦ in column H (move (A,11,H)) accomplishes two things:\n    *   It builds a longer same-suit sequence (7♦ 6♦ 5♦) in column H.\n    *   It reveals the card at A,10, which is 7♥.\n3.  Revealing the 7♥ is beneficial because it can then be moved onto the 8♥ in column J (J,4), which would in turn reveal the A♦ at A,9. This sequence of moves reveals two hidden cards.\n4.  Other potential moves like (E,9,G) or (H,9,J) also reveal cards, but the sequence starting with (A,11,H) leads to revealing an Ace, which is strategically valuable.\n\nAnswer: (A,11,H)","Reasoning: The game is nearing its end (Epoch 88\/100) and there are no more 'hit' opportunities. The priority is to reveal hidden cards and build towards completing King-to-Ace sequences. Moving the Q♦ (I, index 7) onto the K♦ (G, index 4) achieves two objectives:\n1.  It creates a K♦-Q♦ sequence, initiating progress on the Diamond suit.\n2.  It reveals the card at I[6] (which is 6♠), potentially opening up further moves.\n\nAnswer: (I,7,G)","Reasoning: The primary goal with limited moves and no hits left is to reveal hidden cards and consolidate sequences. Moving the 3♣ from column J onto the 4♣ in column F achieves both: it reveals the card underneath (K♣) in column J, which is valuable, and it continues a club sequence (4♣-3♣) in column F. Revealing a King provides significant potential for future moves.\n\nAnswer: (J,11,F)","Reasoning:\n1.  Check for moves that reveal hidden ('XX') cards. The move (E,4,G) moves the 2♣ from column E (index 4) onto the 3♣ in column G (index 11, which is the current top card). This move will reveal the card at E(3). Revealing hidden cards is a primary goal.\n2.  Check for moves that create better same-suit sequences. (E,4,G) moves 2♣ onto 3♣, creating a 3♣-2♣ sequence in column G.\n3.  Check for moves that could empty a column. No immediate moves empty a column.\n4.  Check for moves that consolidate sequences significantly. (A,10,B) moves a 3-card run (7♦-6♦-5♦) onto 8♦, creating a 4-card run. (C,9,G) moves 2♣ onto 3♣. (F,10,I), (G,8,I), (H,9,I) all move a 2♦ onto 3♦.\n5.  Compare options: Revealing a hidden card with (E,4,G) is generally the most beneficial action as it provides more information and potentially enables further moves.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Game State:** We are late in the game (Epoch 91\/100) with no more 'hit' chances available.

Building same-suit sequences and freeing up useful cards are secondary priorities.\n3.  **Analyze Moves:**\n    *   Moving 3♣ from Column H (index 3) to Column G (onto 4♣ at index 10) is a legal move: (H,3,G).\n    *   This move accomplishes the highest priority: it will flip the card at H index 2 from 'XX' to face-up.\n    *   Other moves, like building longer sequences (e.g., (G,8,C) or (J,5,B)) or freeing useful cards (e.g., (H,8,D)), are beneficial but do not reveal hidden cards. Given the limited turns remaining, uncovering hidden cards is crucial.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The move (H,3,G) directly addresses the most critical need at this stage of the game by revealing a hidden card.\n\nAnswer: (H,3,G)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards, ideally high-ranking ones like Kings or Queens, and create opportunities to build same-suit sequences. Several moves are possible:\n1.  `(A,11,H)`: Moves 6♦-5♦ onto 7♦. Reveals 7♥. Builds a diamond sequence.\n2.  `(E,8,G)`: Moves J♠ onto Q♠. Reveals 9♥. Builds a spade sequence.\n3.  `(F,9,I)`: Moves 2♦ onto 3♦. Reveals 3♦. Builds a diamond sequence.\n4.  `(G,11,F)`: Moves 3♣ onto 4♣. Reveals 4♣. Builds a club sequence.\n5.  `(H,10,F)` or `(H,10,I)`: Moves 2♦ onto 3♦. Reveals Q♣. Builds a diamond sequence.\n6.  `(J,7,G)` or `(J,7,H)`: Moves 3♥ onto 4♥. Reveals K♣. Builds a heart sequence.\n\nComparing these, revealing the K♣ offers the most potential progress. Both `(J,7,G)` and `(J,7,H)` achieve this by moving the 3♥ onto a 4♥. Placing it on column G (`(J,7,G)`) seems reasonable as it adds to a column with some existing hearts (4♥) and reveals the K♣ at J,6.\n\nAnswer: (J,7,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  There are no 'hit' chances left, and the game is near the end (Epoch 93\/100). The priority is to make moves that reveal hidden cards and potentially complete sequences.\n2.  Several moves are possible: (E,7,B), (G,11,F), (H,9,D), (H,9,J), (I,9,F), (J,7,H).\n3.  Moving the Q♣ from column H (index 9) to either column D (index 6, K♣) or column J (index 6, K♣) seems promising. Let's choose (H,9,D).\n4.  Executing (H,9,D) moves Q♣ onto K♣, which slightly builds towards a sequence and reveals the card at H8 (which is 7♦).\n5.  This revealed 7♦ can then be moved onto the 8♦ at B9, revealing H7 (6♠).\n6.  This 6♠ can then be moved onto the 7♠ at F4, revealing H6 (9♠).\n7.  This chain of uncovering cards in column H appears more productive than other initial moves like (E,7,B) or (G,11,F), maximizing the chance to uncover useful cards or sequences within the limited remaining turns.\n\nAnswer: (H,9,D)","Reasoning:\nThe highest priority is to create an empty column, as this provides the most flexibility for maneuvering cards, especially with few turns remaining and no hits left. Moving the 2♥ from column D (index 5) onto the 3♥ in column J achieves this. It also builds a small same-suit sequence (2♥-3♥) and reveals the card at D index 4.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,J)","Reasoning: Moving the 3♣ from column J onto the 4♣ in column F achieves two goals: it progresses a same-suit sequence (4♣-3♣) and it reveals the card underneath the 3♣ in column J, which turns out to be a K♣. Revealing hidden cards, especially Kings, is important for opening up further possibilities.\n\nAnswer: (J,11,F)","Reasoning: Revealing face-down cards is crucial, especially high-ranking cards like Kings, as they are the foundation for completing sequences. Moving the 6♦-5♦ run from column A onto the 7♦ in column H achieves this. This move exposes the K♥ at A,10. Subsequently, one of the Q♥ cards (from column I or J) can be moved onto this K♥, furthering the Heart sequence and revealing another card. Given the limited turns remaining (Epoch 96\/100) and no more 'hit' options, uncovering Kings is a top priority.\n\nAnswer: (A,11,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  **Goal:** Build same-suit sequences K->A.\n2.  **Epoch Limit:** Only 3 turns remaining (97\/100). Need efficient moves.\n3.  **No 'hit'**: The deck is empty.\n4.  **Evaluate Moves:**\n    *   (E,9,G): Moves J♠ onto Q♠. Creates Q♠-J♠ sequence. Reveals 9♥. Good.\n    *   (F,8,A): Moves 8♣-3♦ onto 9♣. Mixed suit. Reveals A♠. Okay.\n    *   (G,9,H): Moves 5♣-4♣ onto 6♣. Creates 6♣-5♣-4♣ sequence. Reveals 2♦. Excellent for sequence building.\n    *   (H,9,D): Moves Q♣-2♦-3♣ onto K♣. Mixed suit. Reveals 7♦. Less ideal.\n5.  **Best Move:** (G,9,H) builds the longest same-suit sequence (3 cards), directly contributing to the primary goal and making good use of the limited remaining turns.\n\nAnswer: (G,9,H)","Reasoning: The game is very close to the end (Epoch 98\/100) and there are no more 'hit' chances. The primary goal now should be to expose hidden cards to potentially uncover playable cards or sequences in the final turns. Several moves expose cards. Moving the sequence Q♥-J♥-10♥-9♥-8♥ from column I (starting at index 5) onto the K♥ in column G (index 10) accomplishes two things: it consolidates a long sequence (K♥ down to 8♥) and it exposes the hidden card at I,5. This seems like the most productive move available. Moving to column G is chosen arbitrarily over column B, as both options achieve the main goal of exposing a card while consolidating the sequence.\n\nAnswer: (I,5,G)","Reasoning: This is the last turn (Epoch 99\/100) and no 'hit' is possible. The primary goal is to complete a K->A sequence for +1 point. Examining the board, there are several Kings (K♦ at G4, K♣ at D6, K♥ at B10, K♣ at J6), but none have a nearly complete sequence below them, nor can any existing runs be moved to complete a sequence ending in an Ace this turn. Since no sequence completion is possible, any valid move will result in the game ending with a score of 0. A standard heuristic is to uncover hidden cards or consolidate suits. Moving the A♠ from column E onto the 2♠ in column B achieves uncovering a card (at E,3).\n\nAnswer: (E,7,B)","Reasoning: The goal is to make progress towards building K->A sequences, typically by revealing hidden cards or organizing existing cards into same-suit runs. There are three moves available that involve moving same-suit runs and revealing a card:\n1.  `(A,11,H)`: Moves 6♦-5♦ onto 7♦. This reveals the card at A[10] and creates a 3-card sequence (7♦-6♦-5♦).\n2.  `(G,8,C)`: Moves 6♣-5♣-4♣ onto 7♣. This reveals the card at G[7] and creates a 4-card sequence (7♣-6♣-5♣-4♣).\n3.  `(J,7,B)`: Moves 3♥ onto 4♥. This reveals the card at J[6] and creates a 2-card sequence (4♥-3♥).\n\nComparing these, moving the longest same-suit sequence is generally the best strategy as it consolidates suits most effectively. Move (G,8,C) creates the longest sequence (4 cards) and also reveals a card, making it the most productive move.\n\nAnswer: (G,8,C)"],"prompt":"\nYou are a Spider Solitaire expert.

This would reveal the card at J,4.\n3.  Both moves are productive as they reveal a hidden card and create a small same-suit run.\n4.  Moving 8♥ onto 9♥ forms a 9♥-8♥ sequence. There is also a 6♥ visible (G,4). If the card revealed under 8♥ happens to be 7♥, it allows for a longer sequence build later.

Move (B, 6, C) uncovers a card in column B, which has 5 hidden cards, the most among the columns involved in these moves. Therefore, it's the slightly better choice.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,C)","Reasoning: Moving the J♠ from column A to the empty column G uncovers a hidden card in A. Keeping the empty column G occupied by only a single card (J♠) maintains its utility as a temporary holding space for manipulating other columns later, which is crucial since no more cards can be dealt.\nAnswer: (A,5,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  There is an empty column (G) available.\n3.  Possible moves that reveal cards:\n    *   (E,4,H): Move 2♣ onto 3♣.

Uses empty column G.\n    *   (B,5,G): Move the run 3♠,2♠ to empty G. Reveals card B,4. Uses empty column G.\n4.  Comparing these options:\n    *   (A,5,G) uses the empty column but puts a high card (J♠) there, potentially blocking it. It reveals a card from column A (6 cards deep).\n    *   (E,4,H) and (J,4,I) both reveal a card (from columns 5 cards deep) and build same-suit sequences, which is good.\n    *   (B,5,G) moves an existing run (3♠,2♠) to the empty column G. This reveals a card (B,4) from a deeper column (B, 7 cards deep) than the other options. Moving an existing run to an empty column is often a strong strategic move, as it clears space in the original column (B) and starts building potentially longer sequences in the empty column (G). It also uses the empty column more effectively than putting a single high card like J♠ there.\n5.  Therefore, moving the 3♠,2♠ run from column B to the empty column G appears to be the most advantageous move, prioritizing revealing a card from a deeper stack and utilizing the empty column well.\n\nAnswer: (B,5,G)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  There's an empty column (G), which is valuable for rearranging cards and revealing hidden ones.\n3.  Moving 8♥ from column J onto 9♥ in column I (J,4,I) achieves two things: it builds a same-suit sequence (9♥-8♥) and reveals the hidden card in column J.\n4.  Moving 2♣ from E onto 3♣ in H (E,4,H) only reveals a card in E.\n5.  Moving cards to the empty column G is also an option, like moving the 3♠-2♠ run from B (B,5,G) to reveal a card in B.\n6.  Comparing (J,4,I) and moving to G, building the sequence and revealing a card simultaneously with (J,4,I) seems slightly better than just revealing a card by using the empty column at this stage.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: The move (J, 4, I) combines 9♥ and 8♥ into a same-suit run (9♥, 8♥) in column I. This progresses towards building a full sequence and also reveals the hidden card at J[3], which is crucial for uncovering more options. While moving 2♠ to 3♠ (B,6,C) is also a good same-suit merge, merging higher-ranked cards like 9♥ and 8♥ is often slightly more beneficial, and revealing J[3] opens up a potentially deeper card than revealing B[5]. Using the empty column G is an option, but creating same-suit runs is generally preferred when available.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goals are to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences (K->A).\n2.  Empty columns are valuable resources for rearranging cards.\n3.  Moving the run 3♠, 2♠ from column B to the empty column G (Move (B,5,G)) achieves two objectives:\n    *   It reveals the hidden card at B[4].\n    *   It utilizes the empty column G, potentially enabling further moves.\n4.  Another good option is (J,4,I), which forms a 9♥-8♥ run and reveals J[3]. However, utilizing the empty column G with (B,5,G) feels strategically stronger as it clears column B further down and keeps the empty slot flexible for future single cards if needed, while still revealing a card.\n5.  Other moves like (E,4,H) or (B,6,C) reveal cards but are less impactful than utilizing the empty column or building a longer sequence.\n6.  Since there are 0 hits remaining, revealing hidden cards is crucial.\n\nAnswer: (B,5,G)","Reasoning: Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I consolidates a same-suit sequence (9♥-8♥) and reveals a hidden card in column J (J,3). This helps progress towards building sequences and uncovering more playable cards.\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: Moving the J♠ from column A to the empty column G achieves two goals: it reveals a hidden card in column A and it frees up column G, which can be strategically useful for rearranging other cards later. While other moves like (B,6,C), (E,4,H), or (J,4,I) also reveal cards and build sequences, opening an empty column often provides more long-term flexibility.\nAnswer: (A,5,G)","Reasoning: The primary goal now is to expose hidden cards, as no more 'hit' actions are available. Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I achieves this by revealing the card underneath the 8♥ in column J. Additionally, this move creates a same-suit sequence (9♥ 8♥), which progresses towards the goal of building full sequences. Another viable move is (E,4,H), moving 2♣ onto 3♣, which would also reveal a card. However, building the heart sequence seems slightly more advantageous.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: The goal is to build same-suit sequences and reveal hidden cards. Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I achieves both: it creates a 9♥-8♥ sequence and reveals the hidden card at J,2. This is generally preferable to using an empty column unless necessary or to move a King. Other similar moves like (B,5,C) or (E,4,H) are also good, but (J,3,I) frees a card higher up in its column.\nAnswer: (J,3,I)","Reasoning: The primary goals are to reveal hidden cards and create empty columns. Column G is already empty. Moving the J♠ from column A to the empty column G achieves the goal of revealing a hidden card in column A. Jacks are often difficult to move later as they require a Queen or an empty space, so moving it now is beneficial.\n\nAnswer: (A,5,G)","Reasoning: The best move is to build same-suit sequences whenever possible, especially if it also reveals a hidden card. Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I accomplishes both: it creates a `9♥, 8♥` run and reveals the card at J(3).\n\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: Moving the 2♣ from column E to the empty column G is strategically advantageous. It reveals the hidden card at E3 and frees up column G, which is valuable for maneuvering other sequences later, especially for building down from Kings. Other possible moves either create out-of-suit sequences (D,5,H) or consolidate suits without revealing cards or opening columns (B,6,C), or reveal a card but don't open a column (J,4,I). Opening a column is generally prioritized.\nAnswer: (E,4,G)","Reasoning: The primary goal now is to reveal hidden cards, as there are no hits left and no sequences close to completion. There are three moves possible:\n1. Move 2♠ from column B onto 3♠ in column C: (B,6,C). This reveals a card in B.\n2. Move 2♣ from column E onto 3♣ in column H: (E,4,H). This reveals a card in E and creates a 3♣ 2♣ run.\n3. Move 8♥ from column J onto 9♥ in column I: (J,4,I). This reveals a card in J and creates a 9♥ 8♥ run.\n\nAll three moves reveal a hidden card. Moves 2 and 3 also create a small same-suit run, which is generally preferable. Between creating a 3♣ 2♣ run and a 9♥ 8♥ run, there's no strong advantage, but revealing a card is essential. Let's choose (J,4,I).\n\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: Moving the 2♠ from column B onto the 3♠ in column C creates a same-suit sequence (3♠, 2♠). This action also reveals the hidden card underneath the 2♠ in column B, which is essential for making progress. Other valid sequence-building moves exist ((J,4,I) and (E,4,H)), but consolidating Spades is a good step.\nAnswer: (B,6,C)","Reasoning: The primary goal with no hits remaining is to reveal hidden cards and create opportunities for sequences. Moving the 7♠ from column F to the empty column G achieves two things: it reveals the card underneath the 7♠ in column F and it places the 7♠ in an empty column, potentially allowing other cards (like an 8♠) to be moved there later.

There are two possible moves: (E,4,H) moving 2♣ onto 3♣, and (J,4,I) moving 8♥ onto 9♥. Both moves reveal a hidden card. Moving 8♥ onto 9♥ creates a slightly longer sequence (9♥ 8♥), which is generally preferable. Since there are no hits left, revealing cards is crucial.\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning:\n1.  The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  There are no 'hit' chances remaining.\n3.  Possible moves are:\n    *   (B, 6, C): Move 2♠ onto 3♠. Reveals a card in column B.

Builds a 9♥-8♥ sequence.\n4.  All three moves reveal a hidden card and consolidate a same-suit pair.\n5.  Revealing a card from column B (which has 6 cards, one more than E or J) is generally a good heuristic when other factors are equal.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,C)","Reasoning: The primary goals are to reveal hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. There is an empty column (G) which provides flexibility.\nSeveral moves reveal hidden cards:\n1.  (E,4,H): Moves 2♣ onto 3♣. Reveals E[3]. Builds a same-suit sequence. Keeps G empty.\n2.  (J,4,I): Moves 8♥ onto 9♥. Reveals J[3]. Builds a same-suit sequence. Keeps G empty.\n3.  (B,5,C): Moves 3♠-2♠ onto 3♠. Reveals B[4]. Consolidates spades but blocks the lower 3♠. Keeps G empty.\n4.  Moving a card to G: e.g., (A,5,G) moves J♠ to G. Reveals A[4]. Occupies the empty column G.\n\nMoves (E,4,H) and (J,4,I) are strong because they both reveal a hidden card and build a same-suit sequence without occupying the empty column G.

Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I achieves both: it creates a 9♥-8♥ run (progressing towards a Heart sequence) and reveals the card underneath the 8♥ in column J. Moving the 2♣ (E) to the 3♣ (H) is possible but doesn't uncover a card. Moving a card to the empty column G would uncover a card, but building the same-suit run seems more strategically valuable at this stage.\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: The goal is to build same-suit sequences. Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I creates a 9♥-8♥ sequence.

Another good option is moving 8♥ from J onto 9♥ in I (J,4,I), which would reveal J4 and create a 9♥-8♥ sequence. Both moves are comparable, but consolidating lower-rank cards like 2♣ and 3♣ can sometimes be slightly more advantageous.\n5.  Moving cards to the empty column G is possible, but using the empty column just to flip one card is less preferable than making a move that both flips a card and builds a same-suit sequence.\n\nAnswer: (E,4,H)","Reasoning:\n1.  The primary goal is to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences.\n2.  There is an empty column (G) available.\n3.  Moving 8♥ from column J onto 9♥ in column I (J, 3, I) achieves two goals: it builds a same-suit sequence (9♥-8♥) and uncovers the hidden card at J[2].\n4.  Moving the 3♠-2♠ sequence from B to G (B, 5, G) would also uncover a hidden card in B, but it uses the empty column, which might be better saved for larger sequences or more complex rearrangements.\n5.  Moving 2♠ from B onto 3♠ in C (B, 6, C) also uncovers a card in B and builds a sequence, but merging onto an existing column like in (J, 3, I) is slightly preferable to just moving a piece to another stack unless it enables further moves.\n6.

Moving a card to the empty column G would also reveal a card, but the move (J,4,I) additionally builds a sequence without immediately consuming the empty column resource.\n4.  Moving the 2♠ onto the 3♠ (B,6,C) does not reveal any hidden cards.\n\nTherefore, moving the 8♥ to the 9♥ is the best move as it reveals a card and progresses sequence building.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: The most strategic move is usually one that reveals a hidden card or creates an empty column. Moving the J♠ from column A to the empty column G achieves both of these objectives. This opens up possibilities for future moves and reveals a card that might enable further plays. Other potential moves, like (E,4,H) or (J,4,I), also reveal cards and build same-suit sequences, which are good, but creating an empty column provides more flexibility, especially since no more cards can be dealt.\n\nAnswer: (A,4,G)","Reasoning: The primary goal with no hits remaining and limited turns is to reveal hidden cards and consolidate same-suit sequences. Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I accomplishes this by revealing the card at J,3 and creating a 9♥-8♥ run. Another good option is moving 2♣ (E,4) to 3♣ (H), revealing E,3. Moving 2♠ (B,6) to 3♠ (C) reveals B,5. Let's choose the move involving higher-ranked cards.\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: The goal is to build same-suit sequences and reveal hidden cards. Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I accomplishes both: it creates a 9♥-8♥ sequence and reveals the hidden card at J[3]. This increases the chances of finding further moves or building towards a full sequence.\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: Moving the 8♥ onto the 9♥ creates a same-suit sequence (9♥-8♥) which is a primary goal. This move also reveals the hidden card underneath the 8♥ in column J.\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: The goal is to build sequences and reveal hidden cards. Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I achieves both: it builds a 9♥-8♥ sequence and reveals the hidden card at J[3]. While moving the 2♠ from B to C is also possible, revealing a card higher up (J[3] vs B[4]) is generally preferred. There are no hits remaining.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: Moving the J♠ from column A to the empty column G serves two purposes: it reveals a hidden card in column A, which is essential for progress, and it keeps the empty column G available for future strategic rearrangements. While other moves like (J,4,I) or (E,4,H) would also reveal cards and build small sequences, creating\/maintaining an empty column generally provides more flexibility.\nAnswer: (A,4,G)","Reasoning: The primary goal is to reveal hidden cards. There are three valid moves:\n1.  `(B,6,C)`: Moves 2♠ onto 3♠. Reveals the 3♠ at B,4.\n2.  `(J,4,I)`: Moves 8♥ onto 9♥. Reveals the hidden card at J,3.\n3.  `(E,4,H)`: Moves 2♣ onto 3♣. Reveals the hidden card at E,3.\n\nMoves `(J,4,I)` and `(E,4,H)` reveal currently unknown ('XX') cards, which is generally better than revealing a known card type that was just hidden (like the 3♠ in B). Both revealing moves seem equally beneficial. I will choose `(J,4,I)` to consolidate the heart sequence.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I builds a same-suit sequence (9♥, 8♥) and reveals a new card in column J. Building same-suit sequences and revealing hidden cards are primary objectives.\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: The best strategy is often to uncover hidden cards, especially those in columns with fewer visible cards or under high-ranking cards like Jacks. Moving the J♠ from column A to the empty column G achieves this by uncovering the card at A[4] and utilizing the valuable empty space. Building the 9♥-8♥ sequence by moving (J,4,I) or the 3♠-2♠ sequence by moving (B,6,C) are also good moves as they create same-suit runs, but freeing up column A by moving the J♠ seems slightly more advantageous at this stage.\n\nAnswer: (A,5,G)","Reasoning: The primary goal now is to reveal hidden cards, as there are no more 'hit' chances and the turn limit is approaching. Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I achieves this by exposing the card at J, index 3. It also builds a same-suit sequence.\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: The goal is to reveal hidden cards and build sequences. Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I achieves both: it creates a longer same-suit sequence (9♥-8♥) and reveals the hidden card at J[3]. This seems slightly more promising than moving the 2♠ to column C, as it reveals a card in a column with fewer face-up cards.\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: The goal is to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I creates a 9♥-8♥ sequence. This action also uncovers the hidden card at index 4 in column J, potentially opening up more moves. This is generally better than moving a single card to the empty column G, as it achieves two objectives: sequence building and card uncovering.\n\nAnswer: (J,5,I)","Reasoning: The best move is to consolidate same-suit runs where possible, especially when it reveals a hidden card. Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I creates a 2-card heart sequence and reveals the card at J[4].\nAnswer: (J,5,I)","Reasoning: Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I builds a same-suit sequence (9♥-8♥) and, importantly, uncovers the hidden card at J,3. This is generally preferable to moving the J♠ to the empty column G or moving the 2♣ onto the 3♣, as it both progresses a sequence and reveals a card.\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: The game is very close to the end (Epoch 98\/100) and there are no hits remaining. The primary goal now is to expose hidden cards to potentially create sequences or enable further moves in the last turn. Several moves expose one hidden card:\n1.  (B,6,C): Moves 2♠ onto 3♠. Exposes a card in B. Creates a 3♠-2♠ run.\n2.  (J,4,I): Moves 8♥ onto 9♥. Exposes a card in J. Creates a 9♥-8♥ run.\n3.  Moving various cards\/runs to the empty column G also exposes one card in the source column.\n\nComparing these, moves (B,6,C) and (J,4,I) both expose a card and create a small same-suit run, which is generally beneficial. Moving cards to the empty column G also exposes a card but might use up the empty space less strategically. Between (B,6,C) and (J,4,I), creating the 9♥-8♥ run seems slightly more promising if a 10♥ were to appear next, although both options are comparable. Let's choose to expose the card in column J.\n\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: The goal is to uncover hidden cards and build same-suit sequences. Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I achieves both: it uncovers the card at J3 and continues a heart sequence (9♥, 8♥). Other moves that uncover cards would break suit sequences. Since this is the last turn (Epoch 99\/100), uncovering a card is the most potentially beneficial action.\nAnswer: (J,4,I)","Reasoning: The game has reached its epoch limit (100\/100), so no further actions are technically possible according to the rules provided (\"The game also ends after 100 epochs\"). However, assuming the prompt requires suggesting a valid move if one exists even at the limit, there are several options. Moving the 8♥ from column J onto the 9♥ in column I is a valid move that builds a same-suit sequence and reveals a hidden card (J[3]).\nAnswer: (J,4,I)"],"prompt":"\nYou are a Spider Solitaire expert.
