The rule requires that when moving a run, its top card must be placed onto an accessible card that is exactly one rank higher and of the same suit. Since 3♥ needs a 4♥ as destination and Column B’s bottom (exposed) card is 4♥, moving the “3♥,2♥” run from Column A onto Column B is legal and strategically beneficial because it frees up hidden cards.\n2.

Normally, if all columns were non‑empty and a “hit” were available you’d deal new cards, but as the board shows, your “hit” chances are 0. Thus no legal move exists.\n\nAnswer: hit","","1. I’ve examined every movable (face‑up) run in each column and compared their card values. None of the available cards (or multi‐card runs) can be legally moved onto another column’s top card (or into an empty column). In Spider, if no legal moves remain the “hit” (deal new cards) is normally used, but here the “hit” chances have been exhausted. Still, in this situation there isn’t any viable move.\n\n2. Answer: hit","1. In Column A the face‑up cards form a partially descending sequence. Although the bottom card “8♠” is isolated, the two cards starting at row 5 “3♥” followed by “2♥” are in proper descending (and same‑suit) order. They can be moved as a block. Looking at Column B, its bottom visible card is “4♥” which is exactly one rank higher than “3♥” and of the same suit. Therefore, the best move is to move the run “3♥,2♥” from Column A (starting at row 5) onto Column B.\n2. Answer: (A,5,B)","1. All the face‐up cards are “stuck” – none can be moved onto another because no card is available whose value is exactly one higher (and of the same suit) than any face‐up card. In addition, all columns contain cards (so there’s no empty column to absorb a King or any run) and there are no hit chances left. As a result, no legal moves are available.\n2. Answer: hit","After examining all columns’ exposed runs, no legal sequence‐move can be found. When no legal moves exist the Spider rules tell you to “hit” (deal new cards) if all columns are non‑empty and a hit is allowed; here no move can be made and though there are no remaining hit chances, “hit” is the only prescribed action in a dead‐end situation.\n\nAnswer: hit","There isn’t any legal move – none of the available visible runs can be placed on top of a card that is exactly one rank higher in‐suit, and no column is empty while “hit” isn’t allowed (the remaining hit chances are 0).

Reasoning: Reviewing every movable (face‑up) card shows that no card (or descending, same‑suit run) can legally be placed atop any other card. When no legal moves exist, the rules instruct us to “hit” (deal new cards) provided every column is non‑empty and at least 10 cards remain in the deck.

Answer: hit","After reviewing the board’s visible (movable) cards – one per column – I find that none can legally be placed onto another column (for example, the 8♠ in column A would need to be moved onto a 9♠ in spades, but no column’s bottom card is a 9♠; likewise every other candidate fails the “one‐rank higher, same suit” test). With every column non‑empty and no legal moves available, the Spider Solitaire rules instruct you to “hit” (deal a new row) when no moves exist.

However, the rules state that a hit is only allowed when there are remaining hit chances—and here that count is 0, so no hit is allowed either. \n\nThus, given the board at epoch 98\/100 there is no legal move.\n\nAnswer: hit","1. None of the face‐up cards can be legally moved onto another card (for example, 8♠ would need a 9♠ destination, 4♥ would need a 5♥, etc.) and no empty column exists to receive any (even though moving a card from a one‐card column would free it up, you can’t move it until there already is an empty column). In Spider this means no legal “move” is available. The rules then say that if no legal moves remain (and every column is non‑empty) you should “hit” – dealing a new row – but here the number of remaining hit chances is 0, so no hit is allowed. With no legal move available on the final epoch the game is over.\n2. Answer: hit","After checking every column’s face–up card, I couldn’t find any descending, same‐suit run that can be attached to a destination card – and since no column is empty, no “empty‐column” move is possible. With the deck’s hit chances exhausted and we at epoch 100, there is no legal move available.\n\nAnswer: hit"],"prompt":"\nYou are a Spider Solitaire expert.

I notice that column F’s visible card is A♥, and moving it onto another column is legal if its destination’s top card is exactly one rank higher in the same suit—in this case, heart. Column H’s top card is 2♥, and since the descending order in Spider is K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A, 2♥ is the correct card to accept an A♥. Thus, moving the A♥ from column F (at row 4) onto column H is valid and advantageous because it will free up column F by revealing its previously hidden card.\n\nAnswer: (F,4,H)","1. I noticed that column E has a face‑up A♥. In Spider Solitaire the goal is to build descending sequences from King to Ace. One valid move is to place an A♥ onto a 2♥ (since A is exactly one rank lower than 2). Column H shows a 2♥. So moving the A♥ from column E onto the 2♥ on column H extends that sequence.\n2. Answer: (E,0,H)","1. Moving the A♥ from column E (its visible card at row index 4) onto the 2♥ in column H is legal since 2♥ is exactly one rank higher than A♥ in hearts, and it creates a descending run.

Moving a run starting with A♥ onto a 2♥ is legal since in Spider Solitaire the descending sequence runs from K down to A (with Ace at the bottom, so 2 is exactly one rank above Ace). Column H’s visible card is 2♥, so moving an A♥ (from column E, for example) will place it correctly. This move not only builds a part of a potential complete K→A sequence but also reveals a hidden card in column E.\n\nAnswer: (E,0,H)","Reasoning: The logical move is to uncover hidden cards by moving one of the A♥ cards.

The best move is to take one of the A♥ cards (a descending run of one card) and move it onto the 2♥ in column H.

Moving the J♦ from column B onto the Q♦ in column G is legal since in a descending same‑suit run, Q♦ (the destination) is exactly one rank higher than J♦. This move will remove the face‑up J♦ from B, thereby exposing its hidden card (Q♣), which could create new move opportunities.\n2. Answer: (B,5,G)","1. My reasoning is as follows. Looking over the visible cards, one attractive move is to free up a column because empty columns are extremely valuable. Column J’s only face‑up card is A♠ (at row 4) and it can be legally moved onto column I’s top card, 2♠ (since A is exactly one below 2).

Moving the 6♦ from column B onto the 7♦ in column C (since 7 is exactly one rank higher than 6 and they share the diamond suit) helps to start building a descending run that can later be extended (for example, by moving the entire run onto the 8♦ in column F). This appears to be the best next move.\n\nAnswer: (B,5,C)","1. Reasoning: In column B, the visible card is 6♦ (at index 5) and in column C the visible card is 7♦. Since 7♦ is exactly one rank higher than 6♦ and they share the same suit, moving 6♦ (as a run of one card) from column B to column C is a legal descending move.\n2. Answer: (B,5,C)","Reasoning: Column C’s face‐up card is 7♦, which can form a descending run with 8♦ if placed on it (from column F). Moving the single card 7♦ onto the 8♦ in column F not only merges diamond cards to build a longer run, but also frees up column C so that the hidden card underneath can be flipped, increasing future mobility.\n\nAnswer: (C,5,F)","Reasoning: I see that in column B the only face‐up card is 6♦ (at row 5), and in column C the face‑up card is 7♦ (at row 5). Since 7♦ is exactly one rank higher than 6♦ and both share the same suit, moving the 6♦ from column B onto column C is a legal and helpful move as it will combine two diamond cards into a descending sequence. This also frees up column B by revealing its next hidden card, which often opens further opportunities.\n\nAnswer: (B,5,C)","Reasoning: Column B's face‐up card is 6♦ and Column C’s face‑up card is 7♦.

Only the bottom card “8♦” forms a valid descending run by itself. To place it, we need a destination column whose top card is exactly one rank higher (i.e. 9♦ of diamonds). Column C’s bottom card is “9♦” (and is diamonds), so moving “8♦” from Column A to Column C is legal.

In Column A, the visible cards (from the top of the face‑up portion) are: index0: 3♥, index1: 2♥, index2: A♠, index3: 8♦. Thus, moving the run starting at index 3 from A to C is the best next move.\n\nAnswer: (A,3,C)","I noticed that the only immediately legal move is to build upon the diamond sequence. Column A’s face‐up card is 8♦ and column C’s face‑up card is 9♦ – the “one rank higher” card in the same suit. Moving the 8♦ onto 9♦ helps extend the potential run needed to eventually form a complete sequence.\n\nAnswer: (A,8,C)","1. The only legal move is to build on the diamond sequence. Column A’s bottom face‑up card is 8♦ and column C’s bottom card is 9♦ (same suit, with 9 exactly one rank higher than 8). Moving 8♦ onto 9♦ follows the descending same‑suit rule.\n2. Answer: (A,8,C)","1. Reasoning: Column A’s movable run is only its bottom card – 8♦ – because the other face‑up cards above it do not form a valid descending same‐suit sequence. Column C’s face-up card is 9♦, which is exactly one rank higher than 8♦ and of the same suit. Therefore, moving the 8♦ from column A to column C is a legal and promising consolidation move.\n2. Answer: (A,8,C)","My reasoning: The bottom card of column A is the 8♦. Since column C’s bottom card is 9♦ – the next rank up in diamonds – it is legal (and useful) to move the 8♦ onto column C.

This not only builds toward a complete sequence but also clears column D to reveal its hidden card, increasing your options.\n2. Answer: (D,0,E)","1. Moving the 2♠ from column A onto the 3♠ in column D is legal (since 3 is exactly one more than 2 and both are spades) and it will flip over the hidden card in column A, thereby increasing your potential moves.\n2. Answer: (A,5,D)","1. We notice that column A’s face‑up card is 2♠ while column D’s face‑up card is 3♠. Since 3♠ is exactly one rank higher than 2♠ (and both are spades), we can move 2♠ onto 3♠ in column D. This move will begin to consolidate a descending run in spades that we can later extend onto a 4♠ (available in columns E or H) to ultimately build toward a complete K→A sequence.\n2. Answer: (A,0,D)","1. I suggest moving the 2♠ from column A onto the 3♠ in column D. This consolidates a same‑suit, descending spades run (3♠ followed by 2♠) and exposes a hidden card in column A, which can lead to further plays.\nAnswer: (A,5,D)","Reasoning: Column D’s face‑up card is 3♠, and it can legally move onto either column E or H which currently show 4♠, as 3♠ is exactly one rank lower than 4♠ (and both are spades). Moving 3♠ from D to E (via the move starting at index 5) not only makes a legal same‑suit descending move but also exposes a hidden card underneath in D, potentially opening up further moves. Therefore, the best next action is to move the 3♠ from column D onto the 4♠ in column E.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,E)","1. The best move is to move the 3♠ from column D (its only face‑up card) onto column E’s face‑up 4♠, since 3♠ is exactly one less than 4♠ and both are spades.\n2. Answer: (D,1,E)","Reasoning: Column A’s bottom card is 2♠ and Column D’s bottom card is 3♠ (both spades with 3♠ exactly one rank higher), so moving the 2♠ from column A on top of the 3♠ in column D forms a valid descending same‐suit run and reveals a hidden card in A.\n\nAnswer: (A,5,D)","1. Moving the 2♠ from column A (its only face‐up card at row 5) onto the 3♠ in column D is legal (since 3 is exactly one higher than 2 in spades), and it reveals a hidden card in column A. This also begins building a spade sequence that can later be built onto one of the available 4♠.  \nAnswer: (A,5,D)","Reasoning: Column A’s visible card is 2♠ and Column D’s visible card is 3♠ of spades. Moving the 2♠ onto the 3♠ produces a valid descending, same‑suit run. Additionally, this move will reveal the hidden card beneath the 2♠ (improving visibility) without wasting a hit (not available), helping progress toward building a complete spades sequence.\nAnswer: (A,5,D)","1. By moving the 3♠ from column D onto the 4♠ in column E, we extend the spades run (from 4♠ to 3♠) and set up for eventually appending the 2♠ from column A on top. Also, this move frees column D to reveal the underlying card, potentially unlocking more moves.\n2. Answer: (D,5,E)","My reasoning: Column D’s face‐up card is 3♠. It can legally be moved onto a 4♠ (since 4♠ is exactly one rank higher in spades), and both column E and H show a 4♠. Moving the 3♠ from column D to column E (using its face‑up card at row 5) will not only extend the spade run but also reveal the hidden card underneath column D, which is important for unlocking further moves. This move appears to be our best option.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,E)","Reasoning: Column D’s face‑up card is 3♠ and can legally be moved onto column E’s face‑up 4♠ (since 3 is exactly one less than 4 and both are spades). Doing so creates a descending spades run that helps build toward a K→A sequence and also reveals a hidden card in column D.\nAnswer: (D,5,E)","Reasoning: We can extend the spade sequence and reveal a hidden card by moving the 3♠ from column D (which is in a column with concealed cards) onto a 4♠. Column E’s visible card is a 4♠, hence the move from D (starting at index 5) to E is optimal.\n\nAnswer: (D,5,E)","1. Column D’s visible card is 3♠, and column E’s visible card is 4♠ (both spades). Moving the 3♠ from column D onto 4♠ in column E creates a fine descending same‐suit stack and empties column D, which is valuable for future maneuverability.\n2. Answer: (D,5,E)","Reasoning: In column D, the face‑up 3♠ can be moved as a run onto column E’s 4♠ (since 3 is exactly one less than 4 and both are spades). Combining these two starts building a spades run that can later accept the 2♠ (from column A) to extend the descending sequence toward a complete K→A run. \n\nAnswer: (D,5,E)","1. The move takes advantage of a natural sequence: column A’s only face‑up card is 2♠ (at index 5). Its next rank in spades is 3♠, which is the face‑up card on column D.

Column A’s visible 2♠ can be legally moved onto Column D’s visible 3♠ (since 3 is one rank higher than 2 and both are spades). Joining these spade cards creates a 3♠–2♠ run that could later be built further (for instance, moved onto a 4♠ in Column E or H).

I noticed that Column D’s bottom card is K♥ (hearts) and Column I’s face‐up run ends with Q♥.

Noticing that column C’s face‑up card is 9♥ and column B’s face‑up card is 10♥ (both hearts), we can legally move the 9♥ (a descending run of one card) onto the 10♥ since 10 is exactly one rank higher than 9 in hearts.\n\nAnswer: (C,9,B)","Reasoning: The move (C,9,B) takes the 9♥ from column C and places it on the 10♥ in column B, following the rule that a card may be moved onto a card of the same suit with a rank exactly one higher. This consolidates the heart run, potentially setting up further moves and revealing the card underneath in column C.\n\nAnswer: (C,9,B)","Reasoning: We can build a descending same‐suit sequence by moving the Q♥ from column I onto the K♥ in column D. In column I the bottom card (index 4 in its face‑up run) is Q♥; moving it onto D (which ends with K♥, exactly one rank above Q♥ of hearts) creates a promising descending sequence that can later help complete a full K→A run.\n\nAnswer: (I,4,D)","Reasoning: Moving the Q♥ from column I onto the K♥ in column D attaches a lower heart onto a higher one, strengthening the descending heart sequence.

I’ve noted that the face‑up card in column C is 9♥ and the face‑up card in column B is 10♥ – both hearts. Moving the 9♥ from column C onto the 10♥ in column B satisfies the move rule (moving a same‑suit descending run onto a card that is exactly one rank higher) and, in doing so, will reveal the card below in column C.\nAnswer: (C,9,B)","Reasoning: Column I’s face‐up card is Q♥ and Column D’s face–up card is K♥.

Moving from column C will also reveal a hidden card in that column, which is very beneficial in the game.\nAnswer: (C,5,G)","Reasoning: Column F’s face‑up card is 6♠. It can form a descending, same‐suit run by being moved onto column H’s face‑up 7♠, since 7♠ is exactly one rank higher than 6♠.

Moving the 4♥ from column C onto the 5♥ in column G is legal (since the destination card 5♥ is exactly one rank higher than 4♥ and both are hearts) and will reveal the card underneath in column C, potentially opening up further moves.\n2. Answer: (C,5,G)","Reasoning: The visible card in column C is 4♥. Because the rules require a card to be moved onto a destination whose bottom card is exactly one rank higher in the same suit, and column G’s visible card is 5♥, moving 4♥ from C to G is legal. This move also exposes the hidden card in column C, which is beneficial for unlocking further moves.\n\nAnswer: (C,5,G)","1. The move (F,0,H) transfers the 6♠ from column F onto the 7♠ in column H (since 7♠ is exactly one rank higher in spades).

The 4♥ in column C (at index 5) can be moved onto the 5♥ in column G since 5 is exactly one rank higher and both are hearts. This move also flips over the hidden card in column C, which is advantageous.\n2. Answer: (C,5,G)","Reasoning: Both moving 4♥ from column C and moving 6♠ from column F or J onto column H (which has 7♠) are legal. However, moving the 4♥ from column C onto the 5♥ in column G builds a descending same‑suit sequence and reveals a hidden card, which is critical for progress. Therefore, the best next move is to transfer the 4♥ from column C to column G.\n\nAnswer: (C,5,G)","1. Moving the lone 4♥ from column C onto the 5♥ in column G is a legal move that builds a same‑suit descending run and also flips the hidden card remaining in column C.\nAnswer: (C,1,G)","Reasoning: The move that reveals a hidden card is usually a strong choice. Column C’s face‑up card is 4♥, and it can be legally moved onto the 5♥ in column G (since 5♥ is exactly one rank higher and of the same suit). Moving this card will also flip over the previously hidden card in column C, potentially opening additional moves.\n\nAnswer: (C,5,G)","1. Moving the 4♥ from column C onto the 5♥ in column G builds a descending same‑suit sequence and reveals a hidden card in column C.\nAnswer: (C,5,G)","1. I noticed that both columns F and J have a visible 6♠. Because column H’s visible card is 7♠, a card exactly one rank higher in the spade suit, you can legally move a 6♠ onto a 7♠.

I noticed in column C the face‐up card is 10♥ and column B’s face‑up card is J♥. Since 10♥ can be moved onto J♥ (same suit with the destination card exactly one rank higher), moving this card creates a longer hearts sequence and empties column C for future plays.\n2. Answer: (C,5,B)","1. Reasoning: Column C’s face‑up card is 10♥ (index 5) and Column B’s face‑up card is J♥. Since both are hearts and J is exactly one rank higher than 10, moving the run starting at index 5 from Column C onto Column B is legal and helps build descending same‑suit sequences.\n2. Answer: (C,5,B)","Reasoning: Column C’s face‑up card is 10♥ (at index 5) and column B’s face‑up card is J♥. Since 10♥ is exactly one rank lower than J♥ and they share the same suit, you can move the 10♥ from column C onto column B. This builds a descending, same‑suit run and frees column C for future moves.\n\nAnswer: (C,5,B)","1. Moving the 5♦ from column F onto the 6♦ on column I is ideal—it follows the descending same‐suit rule, and by moving the entire face‑up card from F (which was the only visible card) you empty that column.

Reasoning: Column C’s face-up card is 10♥ (at index 5) and Column B’s face‐up card is J♥. Since they are the same suit and J♥ is exactly one rank higher than 10♥, moving the run (in this case just the single card 10♥) from Column C onto Column B is legal. Additionally, Column C has hidden cards beneath its face‐up card so moving it will reveal new card(s) and potentially create more opportunities.\n\nAnswer: (C,5,B)","Reasoning: Column C’s face‑up card is 10♥. It can legally be moved onto column B’s top card J♥ because 10♥ is one less than J♥ and they are the same suit.\n\nAnswer: (C,0,B)","Reasoning: Moving the 10♥ from Column C onto Column B’s J♥ is a valid move (10♥ is exactly one less than J♥ and both are hearts) and it reveals a hidden card in Column C, potentially opening up more moves.\n\nAnswer: (C,5,B)","1. Moving the 10♥ from column C onto the J♥ in column B (which is exactly one rank higher and of the same suit) creates a descending run in hearts and frees column C—giving us more maneuverability.\n2.

Reasoning: In Spider Solitaire it’s generally preferable to move cards from columns containing hidden cards because doing so reveals a new card, potentially opening up further moves. Column C has a face‑up 10♥ with hidden cards underneath. Moving that single card onto column B’s face‑up J♥ (since J♥ is exactly one rank higher than 10♥ and both are hearts) adheres to the descending same‐suit rule and will reveal a hidden card in Column C.\n2. Answer: (C,0,B)","Reasoning: Column C’s face‑up card, 10♥, can be moved onto Column B’s face‑up card, J♥, because 10♥ is exactly one rank below J♥ and they are of the same suit.

Column E’s face‑up card is K♣, so moving Q♣ from column B onto column E is legal and strategically useful as it will reveal the hidden card in column B.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,E)","1. The best move is to move the movable Q♣ from column B onto the K♣ in column E since Q♣ (clubs) can be placed on a card that is exactly one rank higher (K♣), which builds a descending same‐suit run.\n2. Answer: (B,6,E)","1. Moving Q♣ from Column B onto the K♣ in Column E is legal because Q♣ is exactly one rank below K♣ and both are clubs. This move detaches the face‑up Q♣ from Column B, thereby exposing the previously hidden card, which may generate further moves.\n2. Answer: (B,6,E)","1. Reasoning: Moving the Q♣ from column B onto the K♣ in column E is legal because the Q♣ is exactly one rank below a K and both are clubs. This move also helps build a descending same‐suit run that could later contribute toward forming a complete sequence.\n2. Answer: (B,6,E)","1. The best move is to transfer the Q♣ from column B onto the K♣ in column E. This move is legal because Q♣ is exactly one rank below K♣ in the same suit, and it will reveal the card beneath the Q♣ in column B, potentially opening up more moves.\n2. Answer: (B,6,E)","1. Moving Q♣ from column B onto the K♣ in column E creates a descending same‐suit run (K♣, Q♣) and will flip the next card in column B (revealing 3♣), which could help in later moves.\n2. Answer: (B,6,E)","1. I can move the visible Q♣ from column B onto the visible K♣ in column E since K is exactly one rank higher than Q and both cards are clubs. This will combine part of a potential King‐to–Ace run and free the card beneath Q♣.\n2. Answer: (B,6,E)","Reasoning: The only legal move available is to build on the descending same‐suit rule. Column H’s visible card is 2♦ and Column F’s visible card is 3♦. Since 2♦ is exactly one rank below 3♦ and they are of the same suit, moving 2♦ from Column H onto 3♦ in Column F is a legal move.\n\nAnswer: (H,5,F)","1. I noticed that column B’s visible card is Q♣ (row 6) and column E’s visible card is K♣ (row 5). Since Q♣ is exactly one rank below K♣ and both are clubs, moving Q♣ (and its run, which is just itself) onto K♣ is a legal, beneficial move that will reveal the hidden card beneath Q♣.\n2. Answer: (B,6,E)","1. I can move the Q♣ from column B onto the K♣ in column E because Q♣ is exactly one rank below K♣ and they are both Clubs. Moving that card will expose the hidden card underneath column B, which can lead to further progress.\nAnswer: (B,0,E)","1. I recommend moving the Q♣ from column B onto the K♣ in column E because the Q♣ is exactly one rank below the K♣ in clubs. This not only builds a proper same‐suit descending run (K♣, Q♣) but also reveals a hidden card in column B that may lead to further useful moves.\n2. Answer: (B,6,E)","1. Reasoning: In the current board the only meaningful chance to start consolidating a sequence is to build on the King in clubs (K♣) that sits as the bottom card in column E. Column B’s face‑up card is Q♣, which is exactly one rank below K♣ and is of the same suit, making it legal to move Q♣ onto K♣. This move both builds a descending, same‐suit run and will expose the next hidden card in column B for future potential moves.\n2. Answer: (B,0,E)","Reasoning: Column B’s bottom card is Q♣ and column E’s bottom card is K♣. Since Q♣ is exactly one rank below K♣ and both are clubs, the rules allow moving Q♣ (the descending, same‑suit run of one) onto K♣. This move also flips column B’s hidden card, potentially opening more options.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,E)","Reasoning: I choose to move the Q♣ from Column B onto the K♣ in Column E. The Q♣ is a face‑up card in Column B and is exactly one rank below the K♣ in Column E (and both are clubs), so moving it creates a descending run that helps progress toward a complete K→A sequence.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,E)","1. The only clear opportunity is to move the Q♣ from column B onto the K♣ that’s the current bottom card of column E – Q♣ is exactly one rank lower than K♣ and both are clubs. Noting that the visible card in column B (Q♣) is at index 6, we can make a legal move by moving that run (in this case, just the single card) onto column E.\n2. Answer: (B,6,E)","1. Moving Q♣ from column B (its bottom card at index 5) onto column E’s bottom card K♣ is advantageous. It builds a descending run in clubs and will reveal the next card in column B, potentially opening further moves.\nAnswer: (B,5,E)","1. I notice that the Q♣ (column B’s face‑up card) can be moved as a descending same‑suit run onto the K♣ in column E (since Q is exactly one rank lower than K in clubs).\n\nAnswer: (B,6,E)","1. I evaluated the available face‑up moves and found that moving the Q♣ from column B onto the K♣ in column E is legal because K♣ is exactly one rank higher than Q♣ and both are clubs. This move also builds a descending run that could help aim toward a complete K→A sequence.\nAnswer: (B,6,E)","1. I recommend moving the Q♣ from column B onto the K♣ in column E. This attaches a descending, same‐suit run (Q♣ onto K♣) and builds toward connecting cards that may eventually complete a K→A sequence.\n2. Answer: (B,6,E)","Reasoning: In column B the face‑up card is Q♣ (at index 6) and in column F the face‑up card is K♣. Since K♣ is exactly one rank higher than Q♣ and they are of the same suit, moving Q♣ from column B onto column F builds a descending, same‑suit run. This move also frees up column B’s next card, potentially enabling further moves down the line.\n\nAnswer: (B,6,F)","1. Reasoning: Looking at the face‐up cards and any face‐up runs available, the only move that meets the rule is in column B. Column B’s face‐up section shows two cards – from top to bottom: 3♣ (index 0) and Q♣ (index 1). The run consisting solely of Q♣ is valid. To move a descending same‐suit run, the destination’s top card must be exactly one rank higher. In this case, Q♣ can be moved onto a club that is one rank higher, which is K♣. Column E’s face‐up card is K♣. Therefore, the best move is to move Q♣ from column B (starting at index 1) onto column E.\n\nAnswer: (B,1,E)","1. I noticed that column B’s bottom card is Q♣ and column E’s bottom card is K♣. Since Q♣ forms a valid descending same‐suit sequence with K♣ (K is exactly one rank higher than Q, and they are both clubs), you can legally move Q♣ onto K♣.\n2.
