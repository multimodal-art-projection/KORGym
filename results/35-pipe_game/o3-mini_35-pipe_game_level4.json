We must “close” all open‐ports that hit the grid border (with the only exceptions being the designated entrance—the left side of (0,0)—and exit—the right side of (3,3)). Moreover, every two touching cells must “agree” on the shared side (i.e. if one cell opens to the right then its neighbor’s left must be open too). In our puzzle the available pipe “types” are:\n\n• Type L (initially open to Top and Right). Its rotations are:\n  0 rotations: {Top, Right}\n  1 rotation: {Right, Bottom}\n  2 rotations: {Bottom, Left}\n  3 rotations: {Left, Top}\n\n• Type | (initially open to Top and Bottom). Because 90° rotations swap vertical and horizontal:\n  0 rotations: {Top, Bottom}\n  1 rotation: {Right, Left}\n  2 rotations: {Top, Bottom} (again)\n  3 rotations: {Right, Left}\n\n• Type ┏ (initially open to Top, Left and Right). Its rotations are:\n  0 rotations: {Top, Left, Right}\n  1 rotation: {Top, Right, Bottom}\n  2 rotations: {Right, Bottom, Left}\n  3 rotations: {Top, Left, Bottom}\n\nWe then label the 4×4 board as (row, col) with row0 at top:\n Row0: (0,0)=┏, (0,1)=|, (0,2)=┏, (0,3)=L  \n Row1: (1,0)=L, (1,1)=┏, (1,2)=L,  (1,3)=|  \n Row2: (2,0)=L, (2,1)=L,  (2,2)=L,  (2,3)=┏  \n Row3: (3,0)=L, (3,1)=|,  (3,2)=L,  (3,3)=L\n\nBecause (0,0) must accept the entrance from the left yet must not “leak” top (since row0’s top border is non‐designated), we cannot leave it in its original rotation. In fact, by checking the possible rotations for ┏ that include Left (for the entrance) but not Top, we choose for (0,0) rotation 2. (There the cell shows {Left, Right, Bottom}.) Then, to “route” the connection steadily from the entrance to the exit while making sure every open edge touches a matching edge in the adjacent cell, I assigned the rotations as follows:\n\n• Row0\n (0,0) ┏ → rotate 2  gives {Left, Right, Bottom} (entrance on Left; extra exit to right and downward)\n (0,1) |  → rotate 1  gives {Left, Right} so its left matches (0,0)’s right, and its right continues the path\n (0,2) ┏ → rotate 2  gives {Left, Right, Bottom} (its left matches (0,1)’s right; bottom later used)\n (0,3) L  → rotate 2  gives {Bottom, Left} (its left connects to (0,2)’s right; its bottom leads downward)\n\n• Row1  \n (1,0) L  → rotate 0  gives {Top, Right} (its Top matches (0,0)’s bottom; it passes to (1,1))\n (1,1) ┏ → rotate 2  gives {Left, Right, Bottom} (its Left meets (1,0)’s right and Bottom will later connect downward)\n (1,2) L  → rotate 3  gives {Top, Left} (its Left meets (1,1)’s Right and its Top connects with (0,2)’s bottom)\n (1,3) |  → rotate 0  gives {Top, Bottom} (its Top is matched by (0,3)’s Bottom and its Bottom leads downward)\n\n• Row2  \n (2,0) L  → rotate 1  gives {Right, Bottom} (its Right will meet (2,1) and Bottom goes down)\n (2,1) L  → rotate 3  gives {Top, Left} (its Top connects with (1,1)’s Bottom and its Left meets (2,0)’s Right)\n (2,2) L  → rotate 1  gives {Right, Bottom} (its Right will couple with the left of (2,3) and its Bottom goes down)\n (2,3) ┏ → rotate 3  gives {Top, Left, Bottom} (its Top connects with (1,3)’s Bottom; its Left with (2,2)’s Right; its Bottom goes down)\n\n• Row3  \n (3,0) L  → rotate 0  gives {Top, Right} (its Top matches (2,0)’s Bottom; its Right will meet (3,1))\n (3,1) |  → rotate 1  gives {Right, Left} (its Left mates with (3,0)’s Right; its Right goes to (3,2))\n (3,2) L  → rotate 3  gives {Top, Left} (its Top connects with (2,2)’s Bottom; its Left matches (3,1)’s Right)\n (3,3) L  → rotate 0  gives {Top, Right} (its Top is met by (2,3)’s Bottom and its Right is the designated exit)\n\nYou can check cell‐by‐cell that every side facing an adjacent cell is “matched” by that neighbor and that no non‐designated border is open. (For instance, row0 cells now have no top connections, and besides the entrance at (0,0) and the exit at (3,3) no side facing the border is left open.)\n\nThus a valid solution is represented by the 4×4 rotation counts as follows:\n\n[[2, 1, 2, 2],\n [0, 2, 3, 0],\n [1, 3, 1, 3],\n [0, 1, 3, 0]]\n\nFinally, here is the required one‐line answer:\n\nAnswer: [[2,1,2,2],[0,2,3,0],[1,3,1,3],[0,1,3,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

(Note that in the grid each cell is given a rotation value between 0 and 3 meaning “rotate the given piece by that many quarter‐turns clockwise”. It is not necessary to “fix” the pieces that are not used by the water–only the full grid must be assigned a rotation so that when neighbors share an edge the “open” sides match along the successful path. One acceptable solution is as follows.)\n\nLet us label the rows 0–3 and columns 0–3. The board (with types) is:\n\nRow 0: [ cell(0,0)= “|”, cell(0,1)= “|”, cell(0,2)= “┏”, cell(0,3)= “L” ]\nRow 1: [ cell(1,0)= “L”, cell(1,1)= “L”, cell(1,2)= “L”, cell(1,3)= “┏” ]\nRow 2: [ cell(2,0)= “┏”, cell(2,1)= “┏”, cell(2,2)= “|”, cell(2,3)= “┏” ]\nRow 3: [ cell(3,0)= “L”, cell(3,1)= “|”, cell(3,2)= “|”, cell(3,3)= “┏” ]\n\nA sample “solution” has been designed so that the water path runs as follows:\n • It enters cell (0,0) from the left.\n • In (0,0) we rotate “|” into a horizontal piece (i.e. {W,E}) by using 1 rotation.\n • Water goes right through (0,1) – similarly “|” is rotated 1 to give a horizontal connection.\n • At (0,2) the “┏” in its initial orientation (rotation 0 gives {N,W,E}) accepts water from the left (W) and passes it to the right.\n • At (0,3) the “L” piece (initially {N,E}) is rotated 2 times; rotated twice “L” becomes {S,W} – so water entering from the left (W) goes downward.\n • Now in (1,3) water comes in from above; here we use “┏” rotated 1. (Rotation 1 turns {N,W,E} into {N,E,S}, so with water coming in from north the exit is directed south.)\n • In (2,3) we again use “┏” rotated 1 (again yielding {N,E,S}) so water from the north flows further down.\n • Finally, at cell (3,3) we use “┏” in its original state (rotation 0 gives {N,W,E}), which accepts the water from above (N) and lets it exit to the right.\n \nFor the other cells (those not visited by the water path) one may choose any rotations as long as all neighbor interfaces are “boxed‐in” (in our solution we are free to choose an arbitrary assignment; here we simply leave them unrotated i.e. set to 0).\n\nThus one acceptable rotation assignment for the full grid is to use:\n\nRow 0: [1, 1, 0, 2]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 0, 1]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 1]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn other words, the water path runs:\n (0,0) rotated 1  → (0,1) rotated 1 → (0,2) rotated 0 → (0,3) rotated 2 → (1,3) rotated 1 → (2,3) rotated 1 → (3,3) rotated 0,\nand the remaining cells are left with rotation 0.\n\nFollowing the required output format, the answer is given on one line as follows:\n\nAnswer: [[1,1,0,2],[0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In the following explanation I describe a “solution‐path” (the “chain”) from the entrance to the exit and then give a full 6×6 grid of rotation numbers (one per cell) where each number is the count (0–3) of 90° clockwise rotations applied to the pipe in that cell. (There may be other solutions.) \n\nLet the grid’s rows be indexed 0–5 and columns 0–5. The start is at the left side of cell (0,0) and the exit is at the right side of cell (5,5). Recall that the three kinds of pipes and their “base” (0°) connections are:\n• L (letter “L”) – initially connects Top and Right.\n• | (vertical bar) – initially connects Top and Bottom.\n• ┏ – initially connects Top, Left, and Right.\n\nWhen rotated 90° clockwise the connections “rotate” (for example L when rotated produces: \n • 0 rotations: {N, E}\n • 1 rotation: {E, S}\n • 2 rotations: {S, W}\n • 3 rotations: {W, N}).\n\nA valid chain requires that every two adjacent cells along the solution path have matching “open” sides. (Only the connection from the start cell to the exit cell is mandatory; the other cells may be “off‐the‐path.” For our solution we choose arbitrary (mostly 0) rotations on the unused cells provided no unwanted extra connection meets a cell on the chain.)\n\nOne valid “solution–path” is as follows (cells shown as “(row, col)”):\n1. Start enters cell (0,0) from its left side. For an L–pipe there is a need for an open West. Rotation 2 for L gives {S, W} (so the pipe accepts the entry from the left and “exits” to the South). We assign (0,0) = 2.\n2. The water flows South into (1,0) (an L–pipe). To accept a connection from above, (1,0) must have N open. Using rotation 0 for L (which is {N, E}) meets that need and sends the water East. So (1,0) = 0.\n3. The water enters (1,1) (an L–pipe) from the West. Choosing rotation 2 for L = {S, W} provides a connection (entry from West, exit South). So (1,1) = 2.\n4. The stream goes down to (2,1) (a “|” pipe). Using rotation 0 for “|” (which is {N, S}) accepts the connection from above and sends it downward. So (2,1) = 0.\n5. Next the flow enters (3,1) (an L–pipe) from the North. Setting (3,1) = 0 for L = {N, E} enables it to take water from above and send it to the right. So (3,1) = 0.\n6. Then the water goes via (3,2) (an L–pipe) from the West. For L, rotation 2 = {S, W} accepts the incoming connection on its West side and turns it South. So (3,2) = 2.\n7. The water now proceeds into (4,2) (an L–pipe) from the North. Choosing rotation 0 (again L = {N, E}) lets it continue by turning East. So (4,2) = 0.\n8. The flow then enters (4,3) (a “|” pipe) from the West. (Remember that “|” can be rotated; its two distinct states are: rotations 0 (N,S) and 1 (E,W). Since we need to connect a West–incoming connection, we choose rotation 1, which gives {E, W}.) Thus (4,3) = 1.\n9. Next the water goes into (4,4) (a ┏ pipe) from the West. For ┏ the 0–rotation state (which is {N, E, W}) works well—accepting from the West and continuing to the East. So (4,4) = 0.\n10. The stream then flows into (4,5) (a ┏ pipe) from the West. We want eventually to go downward. For the ┏ pipe note that rotation 1 gives {N, E, S} (so it has a South opening). With an entry from the West and an exit South, we assign (4,5) = 1.\n11. Finally the water enters (5,5) (an L–pipe) from the North. Using rotation 0 for L = {N, E} accepts the connection from above and provides an exit to the right (the goal). So (5,5) = 0.\n\nFor all cells not used in the connecting “chain” the rotations are not dictated by the path. In this solution we set them “arbitrarily” to rotation 0 except in one case where a neighbor on the chain would “meet” an open side. (For example, cell (3,5) touches the chain cell (3,4) below a chain cell that has a sensitive connection; so we use rotation 1 for (3,5) instead of 0.) This yields a complete assignment that guarantees the only continuous open connection runs from the start to the exit.\n\nBelow is the full 6×6 grid (with rows listed from top row 0 to bottom row 5, and columns 0–5):\n\nRow 0: (0,0)=2 , (0,1)=0 , (0,2)=0 , (0,3)=0 , (0,4)=0 , (0,5)=0  \nRow 1: (1,0)=0 , (1,1)=2 , (1,2)=0 , (1,3)=0 , (1,4)=0 , (1,5)=0  \nRow 2: (2,0)=0 , (2,1)=0 , (2,2)=0 , (2,3)=0 , (2,4)=0 , (2,5)=0  \nRow 3: (3,0)=0 , (3,1)=0 , (3,2)=2 , (3,3)=0 , (3,4)=0 , (3,5)=1  \nRow 4: (4,0)=0 , (4,1)=0 , (4,2)=0 , (4,3)=1 , (4,4)=0 , (4,5)=1  \nRow 5: (5,0)=0 , (5,1)=0 , (5,2)=0 , (5,3)=0 , (5,4)=0 , (5,5)=0\n\nWhen listed as an n×n list in one line the complete answer is:\n\nAnswer: [[2,0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,0,0,1],[0,0,0,1,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Its initial (0°) configuration is {up, left, right} so it accepts water from the left (start) and lets it go right. (Rotation 0.)\n\n• (0,1) is a “|”. In its default (0°) it connects up–down.

Its default (0°) is {up, left, right} but we need it to allow water in from left and then to go down. One working option is to apply a 180° rotation? In fact, rotation 2 for ┏ yields {down, right, left} so water coming from left can turn down. (Rotation 2.)\n\n• (1,3) is a ┏. For water coming from above and leaving downward, we can use a 90° clockwise rotation on it so that its set becomes {up, right, down} (Rotation 1).\n\n• (2,3) is an L‐pipe (which by default connects {up, right}). Since water is coming from above, rotation 0 works (it has the top) and then it exits to the right. (Rotation 0.)\n\n• (2,4) is an L‐pipe. Water enters from the left so we require the rotated pipe to include left as input. Rotation 2 gives {down, left} so water goes from left to down. (Rotation 2.)\n\n• (3,4) is a ┏.

In this solution we “force” a single continuous path that starts at the left side of cell (0,0), goes right along row 0 until cell (0,4), then turns downward along column 4 until it reaches cell (4,4) and finally exits to the right. (Any cells that are not part of the chosen path are “left” with no rotation – i.e. a rotation count of 0.)\n\nLet’s explain step‐by‐step (using “U, R, D, L” for the four sides):\n\n1. At (0,0) the pipe is a “|” (a vertical pipe with openings U & D by default). Because the entry comes from the left and we need an opening there, we rotate it 90° (rotation count = 1) so that it becomes horizontal (openings L and R). This lets the water come in from the left (our start) and exit via R.\n\n2. At (0,1) we have “┏” (by default it opens U, L, R). With the incoming water coming from the left, no rotation is needed (rotation count = 0) so that its left is open; the natural “right” opening carries the water onward.\n\n3. At (0,2) the cell contains a “|”. In its default (vertical) state it would not match a left–incoming connection. Rotating it 90° (rotation count = 1) gives a horizontal connection {L, R}. That lets water in from left and out to right.\n\n4. Similarly, (0,3) is “|” but needs to work as a horizontal connector. So we rotate it 90° (rotation count = 1).\n\n5. At (0,4) we have an “L” (which initially connects U & R). We now need to accept water coming from the left and then leave downward. For an “L” pipe the rotations are:\n  • 0 rotations: {U, R}\n  • 1 rotation: {R, D}\n  • 2 rotations: {D, L}\n  • 3 rotations: {L, U}\nThe only option that has an opening to the left (for entry) and a down opening (for the turn) is with 2 rotations ({D, L}). Therefore, (0,4) gets rotation count = 2.\n\n6. The water now goes downwards into row 1 at column 4. At (1,4) the pipe is “┏” (initial openings U, L, R). Since the entry is from above, we need its top open and we would like to continue downward. One 90° clockwise rotation gives “┏” rotated to open {U, R, D} (rotation count = 1) – that gives the water an opening from the top and a downward continuation.\n\n7. At (2,4) we have a “|”. Its default vertical orientation ({U, D}) works perfectly for water coming from above and leaving downward. So, (2,4) remains unrotated (rotation count = 0).\n\n8. At (3,4) we again have a “|”. The default vertical (rotation count = 0) works for a vertical connector.\n\n9. Finally, at (4,4) the pipe is an “L” (default {U, R}). The water enters from above (U) and we need an exit to the right. The default “L” (rotation count = 0) gives exactly {U, R} which is what we need.\n\nFor the remaining cells (those not used in the path) we choose not to rotate them at all (rotation count = 0).\n\nThus one valid rotation grid is as follows (row‐by‐row, where each inner list is one row from row 0 to row 4):\n\nRow0: [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\nRow1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRow2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn one line with the required format the answer is:\nAnswer: [[1,0,1,1,2],[0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In our solution we “force‐connect” the cells along a path that starts by entering (0,0) from the left and finally exiting (4,4) to the right. (We label each cell’s rotation by the number of 90° clockwise turns applied to the piece in that cell.) For example, on our 5 × 5 board we choose the following route (using 0‐indexed coordinates):\n\n • The start (from the left) meets cell (0,0). There we use the vertical “|” piece turned 90° (or 270°) so that the “|” becomes horizontal (open left and right). (That is, rotation = 1.)\n\n • From (0,0) the water goes right into (0,1). Cell (0,1) is an “L” piece (whose default is open Top–Right). We want it to accept water from the left and “turn” the flow downward. (For an L piece the rotation “2” yields openings {Bottom,Left}.) So we set (0,1)=2.\n\n • Then the water goes down from (0,1) into (1,1). At (1,1) we have an L piece. To accept water from above we can leave it unrotated (rotation = 0 gives {Top,Right}) so that the water coming from above goes out to the right.\n \n • Now the water enters (1,2), which holds a “|” piece. In order to accept flow from the left we need to “flip” it to horizontal. (Rotating by 90° gives {Left,Right}.) Thus (1,2)=1.\n\n • Next the water flows into (1,3) (an L piece). To accept water from the left and to make it leave downward we rotate this L piece by 180° (rotation = 2 produces {Bottom,Left}). \n\n • In (2,3) (an L piece) the incoming water comes from the top. Leaving it in default orientation (rotation = 0 gives {Top,Right}) lets water go out to the right.\n\n • Then the water enters (2,4). Here the pipe is the three‐way “┏” piece (default: {Top,Left,Right}). We need it to accept water from the left and “turn” the flow downward. One good choice is to rotate it twice (rotation = 2 gives {Left,Right,Bottom}).\n\n • Now water goes down into (3,4). In that cell we again have a “┏” piece; here we choose a 90° rotation (rotation = 1 gives {Top,Right,Bottom}) so that with the water coming from above it leaves downward.\n\n • Finally the water reaches (4,4), an L piece. To accept flow from the top and then exit right (our goal) we use no rotation (rotation = 0 gives {Top,Right}).\n\nFor the remaining cells (those not needed to carry water) one acceptable (if not “unique”) solution is to leave them “untouched” (rotation 0) even though the puzzle’s win condition is met by having a continuous connection from start to finish. (There are many complete solutions – the choice below is one that fixes the required path and simply uses 0‐rotations elsewhere.)\n\nThus one complete answer is to assign the rotations as follows (reading row‐by‐row, with the above values for the path cells):\n\n Row 0: (0,0)=1, (0,1)=2, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=0, (0,4)=0  \n Row 1: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=0  \n Row 2: (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=0, (2,4)=2  \n Row 3: (3,0)=0, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=1  \n Row 4: (4,0)=0, (4,1)=0, (4,2)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0\n\nWhen written as a single 5 × 5 list in one line the answer is:\n\nAnswer: [[1,2,0,0,0],[0,0,1,2,0],[0,0,0,0,2],[0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

One way to “route” the water is to use the following path:\n\nStep 1. Start at (0,0) (a ┏‐piece). The water enters from the left so (0,0) must have an opening facing left. (0,0) is a ┏ whose default (0 rotations) openings are Top, Left, and Right. With no rotation, water coming from left leaves by the right connector.\n\nStep 2. In (0,1) we also have a ┏. Using 0 rotations (openings: Top, Left, Right) the water coming from the left is accepted and again the only “forward” option (since top would be off‐board) is to leave by the right. \n\nStep 3. At (0,2) the pipe is a “|” (which by default connects Top and Bottom). Since water is coming from the left, we cannot use it in its vertical position. Rotating “|” one time (90° clockwise) changes it into a horizontal connection {Left, Right} (because “|” becomes “—”). In that orientation the water enters from left and exits to the right.\n\nStep 4. Arriving at (0,3), the cell contains an L–piece (initially with Top & Right open). To accept water entering from the left we must rotate it. Notice that for an L–piece (whose default is {Top,Right}), its rotations are as follows:\n  • 0 rotations: {Top, Right}\n  • 1 rotation: {Right, Bottom}\n  • 2 rotations: {Bottom, Left}\n  • 3 rotations: {Left, Top}\nSince water enters from left, we require a rotation that includes left. Either 2 or 3 rotations would work. However, if we use 3 rotations (opening: Left and Top) then water coming from left would exit “up” – off‐board in row 0. Hence we choose 2 rotations, so (0,3) becomes {Bottom, Left}. Here water comes in from the left and goes down into cell (1,3).\n\nStep 5. In cell (1,3) we have a ┏–piece. Water comes from above (cell (0,3)’s downward exit). With 0 rotations (openings: Top, Left, Right) the water is accepted from the top. To avoid sending it off‐board on the right (since this is not the target) the water “chooses” to exit to the left. (In these puzzles, at a junction the water takes the only “useful” exit.)\n\nStep 6. The water now flows into cell (1,2) from the right. That cell is a “|” pipe. Again the default “|” (vertical, {Top,Bottom}) won’t work. Rotate it one time (giving horizontal {Left, Right}). Now water entering from the right is received and forced to leave to the left.\n\nStep 7. The water reaches (1,1) which is an L–piece. Here water comes from the right. Reviewing the L–piece rotations:\n  • 0 rotations: {Top, Right} – does not include a reception from the right if coming from that side (water cannot “enter” if the piece has no opening on the opposite side).\n  • 1 rotation: {Right, Bottom} – now the water arriving from the right (the connector “Right” is present) can exit down (Bottom).\nThus choose 1 rotation at (1,1).\n\nStep 8. Now water goes into (2,1) (an L–piece) from the top. For an L–piece to accept a top (coming from above) the best is to leave it in 0 rotations (which gives {Top, Right}). Then water coming from the top is accepted and forced out right into (2,2).\n\nStep 9. At (2,2) is a ┏–piece. Water enters from the left so the piece must include a left connector. With 0 rotations, ┏ has {Top, Left, Right}. Then water (from left) leaves to the right into (2,3).\n\nStep 10. At (2,3) we again see a ┏–piece. Water arrives from the left and we wish to head toward the final cell. (2,3) must send the water downward (because continuing right would exit the grid). The default 0 rotations ({Top, Left, Right}) does not include the bottom. Checking rotations for ┏:\n  • 1 rotation: {Top, Right, Bottom} – but note that 1 rotation drops the left opening, so the piece would not “receive” water from left.\n  • 2 rotations: {Right, Bottom, Left} – this works because it includes left (to accept the entry) and bottom (to send the water down).\nThus assign 2 rotations at (2,3).\n\nStep 11. Finally, water enters the final cell (3,3) (an L–piece) from the top. For an L–piece (default {Top,Right}) 0 rotations already has a top opening and the remaining branch (Right) leads to our goal (the right side of cell (3,3)). So (3,3) uses 0 rotations.\n\nAll other cells that are not used in the water path can simply be left unrotated (0 rotations).

I describe one way of “laying‐out” a continuous water stream from the “start” (entering the grid from the left of cell (0,0)) to the “goal” (exiting the right side of cell (5,5)). (Remember that each cell’s “pipe” is one of three types with these “default” connection sets – before any rotations – as follows:\n\n • The L–pipe (marked “L”) initially connects TOP and RIGHT.\n • The “|” pipe initially connects TOP and BOTTOM.\n • The “┏” pipe initially connects TOP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nA clockwise 90° rotation re–maps the connected sides so that, for example, an L–pipe gets these possibilities:\n • 0 rotations: {top, right}\n • 1 rotation: {right, bottom}\n • 2 rotations: {bottom, left}\n • 3 rotations: {left, top}\n\nIn our solution the idea is to “force” the water along a single continuous route. One acceptable route is for the water to start at (0,0) and immediately “turn” (because an L–pipe cannot go straight) so that from (0,0) the water leaves downward; then in cell (1,0) (another L–pipe) the water – coming from above – must leave to the right; in (1,1) (a ┏ pipe) we “choose” to send the water upward so that it climbs into row 0; then (0,1) (an L–pipe) is chosen with a rotation that accepts water from below and sends it to the right; and the water continues steadily (using some ┏ and – when needed – L’s) along the top row toward the right‐edge, then “turns down” and finally is directed down column 5 reaching cell (5,5) where an L–pipe oriented with the “default” (or 0–rotation) direction (top and right) accepts water from above and lets it exit right. (All cells not “on the path” may be left at rotation 0.)\n\nOne solution is as follows. (Rows and columns are indexed 0–5.) \n\nFor the path we make these choices:\n • (0,0) is an L–pipe. To “accept” the water coming from the start (left) and leave downward we use rotation 2 (which makes its connections {bottom, left}).\n • (1,0) is an L–pipe. Water coming from above must leave right so we use rotation 0 ({top, right}).\n • (1,1) is a ┏ pipe. In order to accept water arriving from (1,0) via its left side and then “turn upward” (exit top) we could use rotation 0 – but note that rotation 0 for a ┏ gives {top, left, right}. (Since water came in from left the only “other” open end available is top.) So we take (1,1)=0.\n • Now the water goes from (1,1) upward to (0,1). Cell (0,1) is an L–pipe. To accept water from below and “turn right” we use rotation 1 (which gives {right, bottom} – note that “bottom” is present so the incoming water from below is acceptable; then it exits right).\n • (0,2) is a ┏ pipe. (0,2)=0 (connections {top, left, right}) lets water from (0,1) entering on the left exit right.\n • (0,3) is a ┏ pipe. We also leave it unrotated (0) so that water entering from the left goes out to the right.\n • (0,4) is a ┏ pipe. Here we again use rotation 0 so that the water coming from its left leaves to the right.\n • (0,5) is an L–pipe. Now the water is coming from the left; since an L–pipe cannot go straight left–to–right, we “turn” it downward by using rotation 2 (connections {bottom, left}).\n • (1,5) is a “|” pipe. To let water arriving from above continue downward we use rotation 0 (vertical, {top, bottom}).\n • (2,5) is a “|” pipe. Again we choose rotation 0.\n • (3,5) is a ┏ pipe. Here we want water coming from above to then leave downward. For a ┏ pipe the 90° rotation (i.e. rotation 1) gives connections {top, right, bottom} – so we set (3,5)=1.\n • (4,5) is a “|” pipe used vertically (rotation 0).\n • (5,5) is an L–pipe. To accept water coming from above and then exit right (the goal) we use rotation 0 ({top, right}).\n\nAny cell not mentioned in the path may be “set” arbitrarily – here we choose rotation 0 for every other cell.\n\nThus one acceptable 6×6 rotation–matrix is:\n\nRow 0: [2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWhen printed as one list the answer is:\n\nAnswer: [[2,1,0,0,0,2],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Here the three available pieces are:\n\n• A “L”–piece which initially connects top and right.

In our final configuration every valve on a cell that touches an “inside” edge must meet a matching open side in its neighbour. Also, on all outer borders (except at the designated inlet and outlet) the pipe must be “closed” (that is, not open to the exterior).\n\nOne acceptable solution we found is to assign a number (0, 1, 2, or 3) to each cell – meaning the number of 90° clockwise rotations applied to that cell’s given pipe – as described below. (A short explanation of the “logic” follows.)\n\n–––––––––––––––\nOur “sketch” of the designed network:\n\n• For cell (0,0) of type “|” the left must be open so we cannot use its default vertical state. Setting it to rotation 1 turns it horizontal ({Left, Right}) which also means it connects on its right to (0,1).\n\n• Likewise the two following “|”–cells at (0,1) and (0,2) are set horizontal (rotation 1) so that a continuous connection from (0,0) to (0,3) is obtained.\n\n• Cell (0,3) is an L–piece. To “catch” the incoming connection from (0,2)’s right (i.e. to have its left open) and to curve downward we use rotation 2 so the L–piece gives {Bottom, Left}.\n\n• Then cell (1,3) is a “|”–piece; its vertical (rotation 0) state accepts the top‐entry from (0,3)’s bottom and passes the connection downward.\n\n• The other cells are “forced” by matching the openings on every shared edge (and by not “leaking” extra openings to the grid boundary). In our solution, for example, cell (1,0) (an L–piece on the left edge) is set to rotation 1 so that it has no left opening (thus not “leaking” on an undesignated edge) while matching (1,1)’s left‐side and so on.\n\n–––––––––––––––\nThe complete assignment we obtained is as follows (written as a 4×4 list of rotation numbers where the rotation number means “rotate 90° clockwise that many times”):\n\nRow Column Pipe (given) Rotation chosen Resulting open sides \n(0,0): “|”  rotation 1 → {Left, Right}  [Left is the entry]\n(0,1): “|”  rotation 1 → {Left, Right}\n(0,2): “|”  rotation 1 → {Left, Right}\n(0,3): “L”  rotation 2 → {Bottom, Left}\n\n(1,0): “L”  rotation 1 → {Right, Bottom}\n(1,1): “┏”  rotation 2 → {Right, Bottom, Left}  (note: Top is closed)\n(1,2): “L”  rotation 2 → {Bottom, Left}\n(1,3): “|”  rotation 0 → {Top, Bottom}\n\n(2,0): “|”  rotation 0 → {Top, Bottom}\n(2,1): “|”  rotation 0 → {Top, Bottom}\n(2,2): “┏”  rotation 1 → {Top, Right, Bottom}  (with Left closed)\n(2,3): “┏”  rotation 3 → {Top, Bottom, Left}  (with Right closed – important since (2,3) is at the right boundary)\n  \n(3,0): “L”  rotation 0 → {Top, Right}\n(3,1): “┏”  rotation 0 → {Top, Left, Right}\n(3,2): “L”  rotation 3 → {Left, Top}\n(3,3): “L”  rotation 0 → {Top, Right}  (right side is the designated exit)\n\nWhen one checks every internal (and allowed external) touching edge, the open sides match exactly and no “spurious” openings occur along a non‐designated boundary (for example, all the top edges in the top row are closed except at (0,0) where water enters from outside on the left, not top, etc.).\n\n–––––––––––––––\nThus, our solution (writing rows as lists) is:\n\n[[1,1,1,2],\n [1,2,2,0],\n [0,0,1,3],\n [0,0,3,0]]\n\nThe final output (one line, with the last line in the format “Answer: …”) is shown below.\n\nAnswer: [[1,1,1,2],[1,2,2,0],[0,0,1,3],[0,0,3,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Using the notation below for each kind of pipe:\n\n• For the curved L–pipe (whose initial connections are top and right), the four rotations are:\n 0 → {top, right}\n 1 → {right, bottom}\n 2 → {bottom, left}\n 3 → {left, top}\n\n• For the straight “|” pipe (which initially connects top and bottom), note that a 90° rotation gives a horizontal pipe (left and right). Thus:\n 0 and 2 → {top, bottom}\n 1 and 3 → {left, right}\n\n• For the three‐way “┏” pipe (whose initial connections are top, left, right), the rotations are:\n 0 → {top, left, right}\n 1 → {top, right, bottom}\n 2 → {right, bottom, left}\n 3 → {bottom, left, top}\n\nOne valid solution found is to “force” a path through these cells (with coordinates given as [row, col]):\n\n Path:\n  (0,0) [┏] – set to 0 so that it accepts water from the left (its west side) and sends it to the east.\n  (0,1) [L] – set to 2 so that with an input from the west it turns downward (south).\n  (1,1) [L] – set to 0 so that an input from the north goes to the east.\n  (1,2) [┏] – set to 3 so that with an input from the west it can be “turned” upward (north).\n  (0,2) [L] – set to 1 so that an input coming upward (from the south) turns to the east.\n  (0,3) [┏] – set to 0 so that with an input from the west it continues to the east.\n  (0,4) [┏] – set to 0 so that water coming from the west goes to the east.\n  (0,5) [L] – set to 2 so that with an entry from the west it turns south.\n  (1,5) [|] – set to 0 (vertical) so that water coming from above goes downward.\n  (2,5) [|] – set to 0 so that water coming from the north goes downward.\n  (3,5) [┏] – set to 1 so that with an input from the north it “turns” to go south.\n  (4,5) [┏] – set to 1 so that with an input from above the water goes south.\n  (5,5) [L] – set to 0 so that with water coming from the north it turns right (to exit the right side, which is the goal).\n\nFor all other cells not “touched” by the solution path the rotation may simply be 0. (There are many possible solutions; the one given below is just one example.)\n\nThus, one acceptable complete 6×6 rotation–matrix (where the entry in row i and column j is the number of 90° clockwise rotations applied to the pipe in the cell at (i,j)) is\n\n[[0,2,1,0,0,2],\n [0,0,3,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,1],\n [0,0,0,0,0,1],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n\nThe last line of my answer is in the required format.\n\nAnswer: [[0,2,1,0,0,2],[0,0,3,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

(Note that there are many possible solutions; below is one valid configuration.)\n\nFor example, one way to “force‐wire” a path is as follows. Numbering rows and columns from 0 to 3, take these steps:\n\n• At (0,0) the piece is an L–pipe (initially connecting Top & Right). To accept water that enters from the left you must “turn” it so that a left‐side is available. (Rotation 2 turns L (U,R) into (D,L); here water comes in from left and leaves downward.) So set (0,0)=2.\n\n• Then cell (1,0) is a ┏–pipe (originally U,L,R). With rotation 0 it already has a top‑edge so that water coming from (0,0)’s down (i.e. entering (1,0) from above) finds a match. From (1,0) the flow is directed to the right. So (1,0)=0.\n\n• In (1,1) we have an L–pipe. To receive water from the left it must offer a left‑connection. Choosing rotation 3 turns L (U,R) into (L,U); water enters from left and then is “sent” upward. So (1,1)=3.\n\n• The water now goes upward into (0,1) (an L–pipe). It enters from the bottom so that (0,1) must have a connection on its bottom edge. Choosing rotation 1 turns L (U,R) into (R,D) – note D means the bottom edge. Then water (entering from below) leaves to the right. So (0,1)=1.\n\n• At (0,2) we have a |–pipe. Because water now comes in from the left (from (0,1)), we need a horizontal arrangement. (The |–pipe rotated 90° or 270° becomes L,R.) So we choose rotation 1. Thus (0,2)=1 and water moves from left to right.\n\n• The water now reaches (0,3) (an L–pipe). To accept water from left, we choose a rotation that has a left‐edge. Rotation 2 (D,L) fits; then water is directed downward. So (0,3)=2.\n\n• Now water enters (1,3), a ┏–pipe. With rotation 1, ┏ turns from (U,L,R) into (U,R,D). Water arriving from above is “sent” downward. So (1,3)=1.\n\n• The water then steps into (2,3) which is also a ┏–pipe. Again using rotation 1 (i.e. U,R,D) we have a top‑edge matching the incoming water from above and a downward “exit.” So (2,3)=1.\n\n• Finally, water enters (3,3) (an L–pipe) from above. To match that incoming connection and at the same time allow water to exit to the right (the finish) choose rotation 0 (which for an L–pipe is its original U,R). So (3,3)=0.\n\nFor cells that are not “on the main route” (i.e. cells where the flow is not forced) one may choose any rotation (so long as a full‐network solution would not “leak” water); here I set the unused cells to 0.

The three pipe types come with these “default” connection sets (using T, R, B, L to denote top, right, bottom and left):\n\n• For type L (“L‐pipe”): 0° gives {T,R}.

Then:\n  – 0 rotations: {T,L,R}\n  – 1 rotation: {T,R,B}\n  – 2 rotations: {B,R,L}\n  – 3 rotations: {T,L,B}\n\nOne way to ensure a continuous water path (with water “entering” from the left of cell (0,0) and “exiting” the right side of cell (4,4)) is to “force” a path through selected cells and assign the rotations so that the pipe in each cell accepts an incoming connection and passes the water onward. For example, we require that the start cell (0,0) must have a left‐side connection.

In the grid the cells on the “solution‐path” have been rotated so that the water enters the grid from the left of cell (0,0) and exits the grid to the right of cell (5,5). (Note: many rotations for the “off‐path” cells are arbitrary since only the “plumbed” route must be correct.)\n\nFor example, one can “force” a path as follows. First imagine the following route (using zero‑based indexing):\n\n  start from left of (0,0)\n  → (0,0) → (0,1) then down to\n  → (1,1) → (1,2) then “turn up” to\n  → (0,2) → (0,3) → (0,4) → (0,5) then turn down\n  → (1,5) → (2,5) → (3,5) → (4,5) → (5,5)\n  and finally exit to the right of (5,5).\n\nOne may “force” the connections by rotating the pieces as follows (remember the three pieces with their default – “zero‐rotation” – connections are defined as:\n • pipe \"|\" connects top–bottom (so rotated by 90° becomes horizontal giving left–right),\n • pipe \"L\" (an elbow) connects top–right,\n • pipe \"┏\" (a T‐piece missing its bottom) connects top–left–right).\n\nOn the chosen route the rotations are determined so that each cell “accepts” the incoming water and sends it out by its other end. For instance:\n – At (0,0) the “vertical” pipe must let in water coming from the left. Only a 90° clockwise turn turns it into a horizontal (left–right) pipe. So (0,0)=1.\n – At (0,1) the “L” piece (which by default has top–right) must now “accept” water coming from the left and (since up is off‐board) send it down. The 180° rotation (i.e. two 90° turns gives connections bottom–left) does exactly that so (0,1)=2.\n – At (1,1) an “L” with no rotation would have top–right. Here water comes from above so that works; thus (1,1)=0.\n – At (1,2) an “L” receiving water from the left must “turn” upward. Rotation 270° (i.e. 3×90° clockwise) gives left–top so (1,2)=3.\n – Now water goes upward from (1,2) into cell (0,2) (an “L”). Here it enters by the bottom. Choosing a 90° rotation for an L (which makes it have right–bottom) means water entering by the bottom will exit to the right. So (0,2)=1.\n – At (0,3) we have a \"|\" piece; water coming from the left via (0,2) means we need to “bend” this cell’s wiring by rotating it 90° (making it horizontal left–right) so (0,3)=1.\n – At (0,4) a “┏” is used in its unrotated state (0) which connects top, left and right. With water coming in from the left, it can continue right. So (0,4)=0.\n – At (0,5) an “L” sees water from the left. (Straight left–right is impossible with an elbow so choose instead to go down.) A 180° turn gives “bottom–left” so (0,5)=2.\n – Then at (1,5) the \"|\" by default (0) transmits vertically. So (1,5)=0.\n – At (2,5) a “┏” must accept water from above; choosing a 90° turn (i.e. (2,5)=1, which for a T‐piece yields top, right and bottom) lets water go down.\n – Next (3,5) is a \"|\" which is kept in the vertical position so (3,5)=0.\n – At (4,5) the “┏” is rotated once (i.e. =1) so that water coming from above has a downward exit.\n – Finally, at (5,5) an “L” receiving water from above is rotated 0 so that the normal top–right connection is formed – thus allowing the water to exit to the right.\n\nFor all cells not part of the solution “trace” one may choose arbitrary (“dummy”) rotations; here we simply assign 0.

The board (with six rows and six columns) is given as follows:\n Row0: \"|\" \"|\" \"L\" \"L\" \"|\" \"L\"\n Row1: \"L\" \"|\" \"L\" \"┏\" \"┏\" \"L\"\n Row2: \"|\" \"L\" \"|\" \"L\" \"L\" \"L\"\n Row3: \"|\" \"L\" \"|\" \"|\" \"|\" \"┏\"\n Row4: \"|\" \"L\" \"L\" \"L\" \"┏\" \"┏\"\n Row5: \"L\" \"L\" \"L\" \"┏\" \"L\" \"L\"\n\nIn our puzzle the start is to the left of cell (0,0) and the goal is to exit the right side of (5,5). (Remember that the pipes are “rotated” in 90° increments; the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 denote how many clockwise rotations are applied to the “initial” piece.)\n\nWe use the following idea for our “solution path”. (Note that each pipe “type” has these initial openings:)\n • The “|” pipe initially has openings at Top and Bottom.\n • The “L” pipe initially has openings at Top and Right.\n • The “┏” (corner‐triple) initially has openings at Top, Left, and Right.\n\nOne valid continuous water–path is shown step‐by-step below (only the cells along the path are “forced” to turn in a certain way; the other cells we leave “untouched” by applying zero rotations):\n\n1. At (0,0) the pipe is “|”. Since the water comes from the left it must “feel” a horizontal connection. (| rotated by 90° [rotation1] becomes a horizontal “–” connecting Left and Right.) So (0,0)=1.\n2. At (0,1) the pipe “|” is similarly rotated by 90° so it connects left–to–right. So (0,1)=1.\n3. At (0,2) the piece is an \"L\" (initial openings Top and Right). To let water coming from the left enter, we use rotation2. (Rotation2 of an L gives openings at Bottom and Left; water from left will go downward.) So (0,2)=2.\n4. Water now flows down into (1,2) which is an \"L\". Because water enters from the top, we choose no rotation here (rotation0: an L with openings Top and Right works, letting water go right.) So (1,2)=0.\n5. At (1,3) we have a \"┏\". For water arriving from the left, we need an opening on the left. Choosing rotation0 (which for ┏ gives {Up, Left, Right}) works well. So (1,3)=0.\n6. At (1,4) the pipe (again a \"┏\") is set with rotation0 so that water coming from the left will continue right. So (1,4)=0.\n7. At (1,5) the piece is an \"L\". With water arriving from the left, we want to go down; rotation2 of an L gives openings {Bottom, Left} so (1,5)=2.\n8. Now water goes down into (2,5) which is also an \"L\". Here, water comes from the top. For an L the option that has the top opening is rotation3 (opening {Left, Top}) so that water can leave left. So (2,5)=3.\n9. That water then enters (2,4) from the right. For an \"L\" with an entry from the right we choose rotation1 – recall that rotation1 (for L) gives openings {Right, Bottom} so water leaves downward. So (2,4)=1.\n10. The water now flows into (3,4), a \"|\" pipe. Since water comes from the top, we leave it vertical (rotation0 gives Top and Bottom). So (3,4)=0.\n11. At (4,4) the piece is a \"┏\". Here water coming down (from cell above) enters from the top. We choose rotation0 so that its openings {Up, Left, Right} let water exit to the right (rather than go back up or left). So (4,4)=0.\n12. Now water moves into (4,5): a \"┏\" pipe. With water entering from the left, we want to direct it downward. Rotation2 of ┏ gives openings {Right, Down, Left} – so the water (having entered from left) will continue down (since going right would be off the board). So (4,5)=2.\n13. Finally, water enters (5,5), an \"L\" pipe, from the top. Here we set rotation0 for the L so that its openings {Top, Right} allow the water to exit to the right (the goal). So (5,5)=0.\n\nFor all the remaining cells (which are not used in our water path) we set the rotation to 0.\n\nThus the rotation grid (expressed as a 6×6 list of integers, where each number is how many 90° clockwise rotations are applied) is as follows:\n\nRow0: [1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nRow1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRow2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3]\nRow3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRow5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn one line (with the exact required ending format), the answer is:\n\nAnswer: [[1,1,2,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,2],[0,0,0,0,1,3],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,2],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In the solution below I “mark” a continuous water‐path starting from the left edge of cell (0,0) and “snaking” its way until it finally leaves the right edge of cell (5,5). (Note that many different rotation‐assignments are possible.) \n\nLet me explain briefly how one may arrive at a solution. Recall that\n• A pipe marked L (the “curved” piece) in its initial state connects Top and Right.\n• A pipe marked | in its initial state connects Top and Bottom.\n• A pipe marked ┏ initially connects Top, Left, and Right.\n\nA rotation means a 90° clockwise turn. For example, an L pipe has these four possibilities:\n  0 rotations (original): {T, R}\n  1 rotation: {R, B}\n  2 rotations: {B, L}\n  3 rotations: {L, T}\n\nThe start is to the left of cell (0,0) so that cell must “accept” water from the left. For an L pipe this occurs only if we rotate it 2 times (so it becomes {B,L}, which lets water come from the left and exit downward). Then one may “force” the water downward from (0,0) into (1,0). In (1,0) the pipe is a ┏ type. In its default orientation (0 rotations) it connects {T, L, R} so the water arriving from above is “forced” (by avoiding the open left edge, which would lead off board) to continue to the right. In the next few cells in row 1 – cells (1,1) and (1,2) – we use ┏ with no rotations so that water comes from the left and goes right. When we reach cell (1,3) the piece is a vertical (|) pipe; it must “switch” to a horizontal connection so that water coming from the left can go right. (Rotating | once yields {L, R}.) We do the same in (1,4). At (1,5) the piece is a ┏ type. Its default (0 rotations) does not offer a downward exit; thus we rotate it (in this example by 2 rotations) to give it the connections {L,R,B} so that water entering from the left leaves downward into (2,5).\n\nContinuing in a similar spirit we assign rotations in later cells so that the water “turns” downward – and eventually reaches cell (5,5) from above. At cell (5,5) the pipe is an L piece, and with 0 rotations (leaving its default connection {T,R}) water arriving from the top flows out right – exactly as needed.\n\nFor all the cells not used on the water path we may simply leave them “untouched” (0 rotations) provided that no “accidental” connections join with the path. (In our solution the “off‐path” cells have been set to 0 rotations.)\n\nA final answer (showing the number of 90° clockwise rotations per cell arranged as a 6×6 list, with rows in order from top (row0) to bottom (row5)) is given below.

(Any solution that makes a correct continuous connection from a left‐entry at (0,0) to a right–exit at (5,5) is acceptable.) \n\nRecall the three pipe types and their “default” (0 rotations) open directions:\n • L (the “L‐pipe”) initially connects Top and Right.\n • | (the “bar”) initially connects Top and Bottom.\n • ┏ (a “T‐shaped” pipe missing the bottom side) initially connects Top, Left, and Right.\n\nA 90° clockwise rotation rotates every open side – e.g. for the L‐pipe:\n rot0: {Up,Right}\n rot1: {Right,Down}\n rot2: {Down,Left}\n rot3: {Left,Up} \n\nFor the ┏ (T‐pipe) note:\n rot0: {Up,Left,Right}\n rot1: {Right,Up,Down}\n rot2: {Down,Right,Left}\n rot3: {Left,Down,Up}\n\nAlso for |:\n rot0: {Up,Bottom} (vertical)\n rot1: {Left,Right} (horizontal)\n(and rot2 = rot0, rot3 = rot1).\n\nIn the following solution the “path‐cells” are assigned rotations so that the connection is as follows:\n\nRow 0 (top row):\n (0,0) [┏]: We need to receive from the external left and continue to the right.

In particular, cells in the top row must not have Up open (except at the overall start if [0,0] is providing the incoming connection), no cell along the left border (other than [0,0]) may have Left open, and no cell in the bottom row or rightmost column may have Down or Right open respectively (except for cell [3,3] which must have Right open for the finish).\n– Moreover any two adjacent cells sharing a common border have matching openings.\n\nOne way to “wire” the given board\n\n  Row0: L   L   |   L  \n  Row1: |   ┏   |   ┏  \n  Row2: |   L   ┏   ┏  \n  Row3: L   |   L   L  \n\nis to assign rotations as shown in the following 4×4 matrix (where the number in cell [i][j] indicates that the cell’s pipe is rotated that many times clockwise):\n\nRow0: [2, 1, 1, 2]\n • (0,0) is an L–piece. Since the input comes from the left, we need a Left opening. For an L–piece only rotations 2 (Down and Left) or 3 (Left and Up) would work. But because the top row cannot have an unwanted Up, we choose 2.\n • (0,1) is L and cannot open Up, so we set it to 1 (producing {Right, Down}).\n • (0,2) is “|”. The vertical ({Up, Down}) option (rotation 0) would have an Up opening (not allowed in row0) so we use 1 (horizontal → {Left, Right}).\n • (0,3) is L. The only allowed option is rotation 2 which gives {Down, Left}.\n\nRow1: [0, 1, 1, 3]\n • (1,0) is “|”. To connect with (0,0)’s Down we use rotation 0: {Up, Down}.\n • (1,1) is ┏. To match the Down coming from (0,1) and to later branch downward, we use rotation 1 ({Up, Right, Down}).\n • (1,2) is “|”. To connect from (1,1)’s Right we render it horizontal by rotation 1 (→ {Left, Right}).\n • (1,3) is ┏ and lies at the right border. To avoid an open Right, we use rotation 3 ({Down, Left, Up}).\n\nRow2: [0, 0, 2, 3]\n • (2,0) is “|”. (Being in the leftmost column it must not have Left open – so vertical is forced: rotation 0.)\n • (2,1) is L. To connect upward to (1,1) we use rotation 0 (which gives {Up, Right}); note that its Right later connects into (2,2).\n • (2,2) is ┏. We choose rotation 2 ({Right, Down, Left}) so it can connect left from (2,1) and right toward (2,3) while also sending a Down to (3,2).\n • (2,3) is ┏ and in the right column so must not open Right. Only rotation 3 would normally avoid opening Right; however, here we need the top to be open (to continue a vertical connection) so we choose rotation 3.\n\nRow3: [0, 1, 3, 0]\n • (3,0) is L. Being at the left border, it is not allowed an extra Left. The choice is rotation 0 for L ({Up, Right}): its Up matches (2,0)’s Down and its Right will reach (3,1).\n • (3,1) is “|”. In the bottom row a vertical “|” would have a Down leakage so we opt for horizontal (rotation 1 → {Left, Right}).\n • (3,2) is L. To have a Left connection (from (3,1)) and also to connect upward (with (2,2)’s Down), the only option is rotation 3 ({Left, Up}).\n • (3,3) is L. As the finish cell it must have an open Right (for the exit) and no Down. Only rotation 0 ({Up, Right}) works.\n\nThe final rotation matrix is therefore:\n\n [[2, 1, 1, 2],\n  [0, 1, 1, 3],\n  [0, 0, 2, 3],\n  [0, 1, 3, 0]]\n\nThis is one valid answer that gives a continuous path from the start to the end. \n\nAnswer: [[2,1,1,2],[0,1,1,3],[0,0,2,3],[0,1,3,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

One possible “path” is to let the water travel from the starting point at the left of (0,0) down then right, making a “stair‐case” through the grid until the last cell is reached from above. For example, you can force the following route:\n\n (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (4,3) → (4,4) → (4,5) → (5,5)\n\nBecause only the cells along the chosen route need “proper” rotation so that the pipe connects the incoming side with the desired outgoing side (and the other cells may be left unrotated, i.e. 0), we can assign rotations as follows. (Recall that the available pieces and their initial connections are: \n\n • L: initially connects top and right.\n • |: initially connects top and bottom.\n • ┏: initially connects top, left, and right.\n\nAlso note that when you rotate a piece by 90° clockwise, its connection directions change accordingly.)\n\nA brief explanation of the rotations chosen for the path:\n\n• At (0,0) (an L piece): Since the water enters from the left (start) we need a connection from the left. The L piece rotated 180° (2 rotations) gives connections bottom and left. So (0,0)=2. The water then leaves downward into (1,0).\n\n• At (1,0) (an L piece): The water comes from above (the top of the cell) so we need the top. L with 0 rotations (connections top and right) works: water comes in top and goes right. So (1,0)=0.\n\n• At (1,1) (an L piece): The water enters from the left (from (1,0)’s right). To have a left connection, one may use L rotated 180° (connections bottom and left). Then water turns downward. So (1,1)=2.\n\n• At (2,1) (an L piece): Now the water comes in from the top; using L in its original 0° (T,R) makes sense (water comes in top and leaves right). So (2,1)=0.\n\n• At (2,2) (an L piece): The water now enters from the left, so we choose L rotated 180° (connections bottom and left) so that it turns downward. So (2,2)=2.\n\n• At (3,2) (an L piece): With water coming from above, leaving right works. Use L with 0 rotations (T,R). So (3,2)=0.\n\n• At (3,3) (an L piece): The water enters from the left; to turn downward choose L rotated 180° (connections bottom and left). So (3,3)=2.\n\n• At (4,3) (an L piece): Now the water comes from above so it can be sent to the right with L at 0 rotations (T,R). So (4,3)=0.\n\n• At (4,4) (a ┏ piece): Water is coming from the left; note that ┏ in its default (0 rotation) gives (top, left, right). That works because the water will move to the right. So (4,4)=0.\n\n• At (4,5) (an L piece): The water enters from the left so we direct it downward. L rotated 180° (2 rotations, giving bottom and left) works. So (4,5)=2.\n\n• At (5,5) (an L piece): Finally, the water comes in from above and must exit to the right (the goal). L in its default 0 rotation (top and right) fits. So (5,5)=0.\n\nAll other cells that are not on the chosen path can be left unrotated (0).\n\nThus one valid complete 6×6 answer grid is:\n\nRow0: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow1: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow2: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nRow3: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRow4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRow5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn one line the required output is:\n\nAnswer: [[2,0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,2],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In the grid we label rows 0–5 and columns 0–5. One way to “route” a continuous path is to force the following path through the cells (with cell coordinates given as (row, col)):\n\n • Start from the left of (0,0). Since the pipe in (0,0) is a “|” whose base is vertical (top–bottom) by default, we must change it so it accepts the entry from the left. Rotating a “|” by 90° (i.e. 1 clockwise rotation) makes it horizontal (left – right). So set (0,0)=1.\n\n • From (0,0) the water goes right into (0,1). Here the piece is an “L” (base: top & right). To accept water from the left it must be rotated so that its left side is open. (A rotation of 180° makes an “L” become (bottom, left)). So choose (0,1)=2. In that orientation the pipe has “left” (to receive the water) and “bottom” (to continue the flow).\n\n • The flow now goes downward from (0,1) to (1,1). At (1,1) the pipe is again an “L.” To receive water coming from the top, using the default (0 rotations gives top & right) works. So (1,1)=0. The water now leaves (1,1) to the right.\n\n • The water enters (1,2) (an “L”) on its left. For an “L” to include “left” it can be rotated 180° (to become bottom – left) or 270° (left – top). Here we choose the 180° rotation so that water will exit downward. So (1,2)=2.\n\n • Now water goes down from (1,2) to (2,2). At (2,2) we again have an “L.” To accept water from the top, rotate 0 (so (2,2)=0 gives top – right) to let water leave to the right.\n\n • The water then enters (2,3) (an “L”) from its left. In order to have its left side open and force the water to exit downward, we rotate it 180° (producing bottom – left). So (2,3)=2.\n\n • Now water goes down into (3,3). Here the pipe is “|.” The default vertical orientation (0 rotations for “|” gives top – bottom) is perfect for water arriving from above. So (3,3)=0.\n\n • The water from (3,3) goes down into (4,3); here the piece is an “L.” To accept water from the top, a 0‑rotation (which gives top – right) works. So (4,3)=0 and the water then leaves (4,3) to its right.\n\n • It reaches (4,4), which is a “|”. But a vertical “|” (0 rotations) would not open to the left. Instead, rotate “|” 90° (rotation =1) to produce a horizontal (left – right) pipe. So (4,4)=1. The water enters from the left and leaves to the right.\n\n • Now water flows into (4,5), whose pipe is “┏” (base: top, left, and right). We need to have the left side open (to accept the water) and also an outlet downward (to head to the final row). A 180° rotation of “┏” produces a piece with connections (bottom, right, left). That works. So (4,5)=2.\n\n • Finally, the water goes down into (5,5) from the top. At (5,5) we again have a “┏.” To accept water from the top and also let it exit to the right (the goal is the right side of (5,5)), the default orientation (0 rotations gives top, left, right) is acceptable.

In this answer, we “rotate” only the cells that lie along one continuous water‐path that starts at the left of (0,0) and exits the right side of (5,5). (Any cells not “needed” for the answer may be left at 0 rotations.) One way to achieve a valid path is to use the following idea:\n\n1. At (0,0) the L–pipe (which by default connects top & right) cannot accept water coming from the left unless rotated. Using 2 rotations (180°) it becomes a “curved” piece with openings on bottom and left. That lets water enter from the source (left) and leave downward.\n2. Then (1,0) is a “|” (vertical) pipe. Keeping it vertical (rotation 0 gives top–bottom) makes water go downward.\n3. At (2,0) we again face an L–pipe. Now the only way to connect water coming from above is to use the orientation that has an opening at top. (A rotation of 0 for L gives top–right.) Thus water will go right from (2,0).\n4. At (2,1) the piece is a ┏–pipe (whose default is top, left, right). Even though several rotations are allowed for ┏, here we set rotation 0 so that the cell accepts water from the left (from (2,0)) and lets it continue to the right.\n5. At (2,2) the pipe is “|”. In order to receive water from the left, we “rotate” it 90° (rotation value 1) so it now connects left–right.\n6. Next, (2,3) is an L–pipe. Although L never “passes through” horizontally, we may use its curved nature if we bring water from the left and make it go upward. (Rotation 3 for L gives left and top.) Thus water goes up toward (1,3).\n7. At (1,3) there is a ┏–pipe. To connect the incoming water (coming from below) and “turn” upward we can use one rotation so that the pipe (rotation 1 gives {top, right, down}) now has a “down” opening (matching the incoming water from below) and a “top” opening to let water go upward.\n8. At (0,3) an L–pipe gets water from below. Using rotation 1 (which for L gives {right, bottom}), the pipe has an opening at the bottom (that connects to the water coming upward from (1,3)) and its other opening at right lets the water continue to (0,4).\n9. At (0,4) a ┏–pipe is used in its default orientation (rotation 0 gives {top, left, right}). With water arriving from left it continues to the right into (0,5).\n10. At (0,5) an L–pipe rotates 2 times (rotation 2 for L gives {bottom, left}) so that water from the left is “turned” downward.\n11. At (1,5) a “|” pipe in rotation 0 (vertical) carries water downward.\n12. At (2,5) another “|” (used vertically, rotation 0) keeps the water moving down.\n13. At (3,5) the cell is a ┏–pipe. Setting it to rotation 1 (giving {top, right, down}) allows it to accept water from above and send it down.\n14. At (4,5) the cell (another ┏–pipe) again uses rotation 1 so that water coming from above is routed downward.\n15. Finally, at the destination (5,5) the L–pipe is set to its default “top–right” configuration (rotation 0) so that water entering from above (from (4,5)) will exit to the right (the goal).\n\nFor cells not on our chosen path we simply assign 0 (i.e. no rotation).\n\nOne acceptable output – written as a 6×6 list in one line – is therefore:\n\n[[2,0,0,1,0,2],[0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,3,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n\nAnswer: [[2,0,0,1,0,2],[0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,3,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

(Note that many answers exist. One acceptable answer is shown below.)\n\nLet us explain briefly one way to arrive at one valid solution. In our problem the grid is 5×5 and the “pipe types” (with their “natural” connections before any rotation) are as follows:\n  • L  – connects Top and Right.\n  • | – connects Top and Bottom.\n  • ┏ – connects Top, Left, and Right.\n\nBecause a 90° clockwise rotation sends each direction to the next (T→R, R→B, B→L, L→T), each cell may be “adjusted” by 0, 1, 2, or 3 rotations. For example, the L‐piece can be made to output (R,B) if rotated once or (B,L) if rotated twice, etc.\n\nOne may “design” a continuous path from start to finish – for example a route that goes from\n start – (0,0) – (0,1) – (1,1) – (1,2) – (2,2) – (3,2) – (3,3) – (2,3) – (1,3) – (1,4) – (2,4) – (3,4) – (4,4) – end.\nThen by “forcing” the connection at a given cell one chooses a rotation that makes exactly the two (or three) ends match. (For instance, at (4,4) the L‐piece must be turned so that it has a connection at Top to catch water from cell (3,4) and at Right so the end point is reached; in our solution we therefore use 0 rotations so that (4,4) is “T,R”.) Meanwhile, any branch “leaving” the intended solution (remember that a ┏‐piece always gives three arms) is forced to “meet up” with an off–solution neighbour that in turn is rotated so that no “leakage” occurs.\n\nOne acceptable solution is given by the following 5×5 rotation–matrix. (Rows and columns are numbered 0–4; each number indicates how many 90°–clockwise rotations will be applied to that cell’s pipe.)\n \n Row 0:  [2, 2, 3, 0, 1]\n Row 1:  [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n Row 2:  [3, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n Row 3:  [2, 1, 3, 2, 1]\n Row 4:  [0, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\nWhen you check (using the rotation rule explained above) you will find that with these rotations every two‐cell “meeting” has matching openings and a continuous path is formed from the start (entering (0,0) from the left) to the finish (exiting the right side of (4,4)).\n\nBelow is the final answer in the required format.\n\nAnswer: [[2,2,3,0,1],[1,0,2,1,2],[3,1,0,0,1],[2,1,3,2,1],[0,1,2,2,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In the grid below each cell is assigned a number (0, 1, 2, or 3) meaning “rotate that cell’s pipe that many 90°‐clockwise turns” from its given “initial” orientation. (Any cells not used in the “water‐path” may be left unrotated; here we simply set them to 0.) One valid solution is to force the water along the following route:\n\n• Start from the left of cell (0,0). Because the piece at (0,0) is an L–pipe (initially open top and right) you must rotate it so that it “accepts” water coming from the left. (For an L–pipe the rotations are: \n  0 → {up, right}; \n  1 → {right, down}; \n  2 → {down, left}; \n  3 → {left, up}.) \nSince only rotations 2 or 3 have a left-opening, we choose 2 so that water enters from the left and then leaves via the bottom.\n\n• Then go down into cell (1,0). This cell contains the vertical (‘|’) pipe. The vertical pipe in its 0–rotation is open top and bottom (and 1–rotation would give left\/right) so we choose rotation 0 so that water coming in from the top continues downward.\n\n• Next cell (2,0) is again L–pipe. Now water enters from the top so we need an orientation that “has” a top entry. The L–pipe in rotation 0 (which is {up, right}) works perfectly. (Rotation 3 would also have top but would send water to the left – not useful here.) So (2,0) is left unrotated (0).\n\n• The water now goes to cell (2,1). This is a ‘|’ pipe but now the water is coming from the left. (A vertical ‘|’ (rotation 0 or 2) has no left\/right openings.) However, if you rotate the vertical pipe by 90° (i.e. rotation 1, which is the horizontal pipe {left, right}) then it can accept water coming from the left and continue to the right. So (2,1) gets rotation 1.\n\n• Likewise cells (2,2) and (2,3) are both ‘|’ pieces. In order for water coming from the left each must be in the horizontal position. So assign them rotation 1.\n\n• Now water reaches cell (2,4) which is an L–pipe. Water comes in from the left. The L–pipe in rotation 2 (which gives {down, left}) will “turn” the water downward. (The alternative rotation 3, giving {left, up}, would send the water upward; we want to follow the grid toward the bottom‐right.) So (2,4) gets rotation 2.\n\n• The water then moves down into cell (3,4). This cell holds a ┏–pipe whose initial orientation (rotation 0) is {up, left, right} – it does have the required top opening to accept water from above. We want the water to leave this cell to the right (heading toward the far right of the grid), and the rotation 0 already has a right–opening. So (3,4) is left unrotated (0).\n\n• Now water travels right into cell (3,5), which is also a ┏–pipe. Since water is coming from the left here, the pipe must be rotated to allow a left connection and then “turn” downward toward row 4. For the ┏–pipe the rotation options are:\n  0 → {up, left, right} (no down)\n  1 → {up, right, down} (missing left)\n  2 → {right, down, left} (has left and down)\n  3 → {down, left, up} (has left and down)\nEither rotation 2 or 3 works; here we choose rotation 2 so that water goes down from (3,5).\n\n• Cell (3,5) sends the water downward into cell (4,5) which also contains a ┏–pipe. Incoming from the top, we need an orientation that accepts from above and “turns” the water downward. For the ┏–pipe, rotation 1 gives {up, right, down} (which works) so let (4,5) be rotated once.\n\n• Finally, the water goes down into cell (5,5) – the bottom–right cell. It too is a ┏–pipe. Since water is coming from above and the goal is to have the water exit the right side of (5,5), we need an orientation with both an upper and right opening. The initial (rotation 0) orientation {up, left, right} meets that requirement. So (5,5) is left unrotated (0).\n\nFor all other cells not on the solution’s flow, we can choose 0 rotations. (Any valid set that results in a continuous, leak–free path from the start to the finish is acceptable.)\n\nBelow is one full 6×6 grid (each row is a list) showing the number of rotations for each cell (row and column indices increasing downward and to the right, respectively):\n\nRow0: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow2: [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0]\nRow3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRow4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRow5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn one line the answer is:\n\nAnswer: [[2,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,2,0],[0,0,0,0,0,2],[0,0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In our solution we view the three pipe‐types with their “base” (0°) connections as follows:\n\n • The “|” piece in 0° has connections {Up, Down} and when rotated 90° (or 270°) yields {Left, Right}  \n • The “L” piece in 0° has connections {Up, Right} and its rotations are:\n  – 0°: {Up, Right}\n  – 90°: {Right, Down}\n  – 180°: {Down, Left}\n  – 270°: {Left, Up}\n • The “┏” piece in 0° has connections {Up, Left, Right} and its rotations are:\n  – 0°: {Up, Left, Right}\n  – 90°: {Up, Right, Down}\n  – 180°: {Down, Left, Right}\n  – 270°: {Up, Left, Down}\n\nIn our 4×4 board the positions (row, col) are as follows:\nRow0: [ (0,0)= “|”, (0,1)= “┏”, (0,2)= “|”, (0,3)= “L” ]\nRow1: [ (1,0)= “L”, (1,1)= “┏”, (1,2)= “|”, (1,3)= “┏” ]\nRow2: [ (2,0)= “|”, (2,1)= “L”, (2,2)= “|”, (2,3)= “┏” ]\nRow3: [ (3,0)= “L”, (3,1)= “┏”, (3,2)= “|”, (3,3)= “┏” ]\n\nThe external conditions are that water enters from the left of (0,0) – so (0,0) must “accept” from Left – and the water must exit the right side of (3,3). Also every border (except the designated start\/exit) must be “closed” (an open side at a border would be a leak) and every touching pair of neighboring cells must have matching open sides.\n\nOne valid chain of choices is as follows (all rotations are measured in 90° clockwise steps from the given “initial” orientation):\n\n• Row 0  \n (0,0) is “|”. To have Left and Right (so that it connects the start from the left and passes water to the neighbor on its right), we set it to horizontal. For “|”, a 90° rotation gives {Left, Right}. → rotation = 1  \n (0,1) is “┏”. Since (0,0) gives water into its Right (thus into the Left of (0,1)), (0,1) must have its Left open. In addition, to avoid opening toward the top (external border) we avoid rotations that include Up. The choice of 180° (rotation = 2) yields {Down, Left, Right}. → rotation = 2  \n (0,2) is “|”. To accept the Right-moving flow from (0,1) its left must be open so we again use horizontal. → rotation = 1  \n (0,3) is “L”. Water comes from the left (from (0,2)). For an “L” piece, the 180° rotation gives {Down, Left} – the left accepts incoming water and the extra Down will lead to the cell below. Also note that in this border cell the top and right must be closed. → rotation = 2\n\n• Row 1  \n (1,0) is “L”. It sits on the left border (so its left must be closed) and to connect with the cell above ((0,0) does not send any water downward) we choose the connection pair {Right, Down}. For an “L” piece rotation 90° gives {Right, Down}. → rotation = 1  \n (1,1) is “┏”. It touches (0,1) from above so the cell above (with {Down} open) forces (1,1) to have Up open and from (1,0) the right–left connection demands its Left open. In “┏”, the 0° rotation gives {Up, Left, Right} (extra Right) while the 270° rotation would give {Left, Up, Down} (extra Down). Here we choose 0° so that the extra Right can feed the neighbor to its right. → rotation = 0  \n (1,2) is “|”. To join the {Right} from (1,1) we need its left open. “|” must then be horizontal. → rotation = 1  \n (1,3) is “┏”. It must accept from the left (from (1,2)) and also from above ((0,3) already passed water downward): so (1,3) must have both Left and Up open. The only possibilities are rotation 0 {Up, Left, Right} or 270° {Left, Up, Down}. However, rotation 0 would add an extra Right that touches the board’s outer border (illegal), so we take 270° which gives {Left, Up, Down}. → rotation = 3\n\n• Row 2  \n (2,0) is “|”. It is reached from above ((1,0) sends water down) so its Up must be open; we use the vertical orientation. For “|”, vertical means either 0° or 180° – here we choose 0° → rotation = 0  \n (2,1) is “L”. Its neighbors force us to choose the connection pair {Right, Down} (so that its Right passes water to the neighbor and its Down goes out to the next row). For “L”, rotation 90° gives {Right, Down}. → rotation = 1  \n (2,2) is “|”. To accept water from the left (from (2,1)) we use horizontal so that its Left is open. → rotation = 1  \n (2,3) is “┏”. It is touched from the left (from (2,2)) so needs Left open, and from above (from (1,3)’s Down) so must have Up open. Among the possibilities, rotation 3 gives {Left, Up, Down} (extra Down will connect to (3,3)). (Rotation 0 would give extra Right toward the border – not allowed.) → rotation = 3\n\n• Row 3  \n (3,0) is “L”. It must connect upward—(2,0) already gives water down—and must send water to the right. For “L”, rotation 0 gives {Up, Right}. → rotation = 0  \n (3,1) is “┏”. Its neighbors (from (3,0) to the left and from (2,1) above) require that it have Left and Up open. In “┏”, rotation 0 gives {Up, Left, Right} (extra Right will pass water to its right) which is acceptable. → rotation = 0  \n (3,2) is “|”. It receives from (3,1)’s extra Right so its left must be open. That forces the horizontal option. → rotation = 1  \n (3,3) is “┏”. This is the goal cell – its Right side must be open to let water out; in addition, it must accept the water coming from (3,2)’s Right (via its Left) and from (2,3)’s Down (via its Up). The only orientation that gives Left, Up, and Right without adding an unwanted extra border connection is 0° – which gives {Up, Left, Right}. → rotation = 0\n\nThus the rotations for the board (listing rows as lists) are:\n\nRow0: [1, 2, 1, 2]  \nRow1: [1, 0, 1, 3]  \nRow2: [0, 1, 1, 3]  \nRow3: [0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nOutput in the required format on one line:\n\nAnswer: [[1,2,1,2],[1,0,1,3],[0,1,1,3],[0,0,1,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In our solution we “force‐create” a single continuous route from the starting point (entering (0,0) from the left) to the finishing point (exiting (4,4) to the right) by choosing an orientation (i.e. a number of 90° clockwise rotations) for every cell. (Note that the board has 25 cells but only 13 of them are “used” by the main route; the others are “dummy”–we set them to 0 rotations by default so that they do not “accidentally” join the intended water–flow. In an actual puzzle you might require every open side to have a matching connection but here we assume that only the single connected path matters.)\n\nFor example, we can choose the following approach:\n \n1. Begin at (0,0) whose pipe is an L (which by default connects top and right). To accept water coming in from the left, we must rotate it so that one open side is left. An L piece rotated 2 times (i.e. 180°) gives the connections “bottom” and “left.” In our solution the water enters from the left and then goes downward.\n \n2. Then, using vertical (|) pieces we go straight down from (0,0) to (4,0). At (1,0), (2,0), and (3,0) the (|) piece in its default (0‐rotation) state (connecting top and bottom) is used.\n \n3. At (4,0) (an L pipe) the default rotation (0) gives “top” and “right.” Because water comes from above, it leaves to the right (heading into cell (4,1)).\n \n4. At (4,1)—an L pipe—we cannot use “0” because that would not accept an input from the left. Instead, if we rotate it 3 times (i.e. “┐” look‐alike) the connections become “left” and “top.” Thus water coming in from the left will be directed upward into (3,1).\n \n5. At (3,1) the pipe is a vertical (|). Using the default (0) rotation it connects top and bottom. Here water enters from below and is sent upward into (2,1).\n \n6. At (2,1) we have a “T–piece” (given as “┏” in its initial state, which has open “top,” “left” and “right” but no bottom). To allow water coming from below and then sent, say, to the right, we rotate it 1 time. (After one clockwise rotation the piece connects “right,” “top” and “bottom”.)\n \n7. In cell (2,2) we have an L piece. To accept water coming in from the left, we choose 2 rotations so that the L now connects “bottom” and “left.” Thus the water is steered downward into (3,2).\n \n8. At (3,2) the cell is a “┏” pipe. With 0 rotations it connects “top,” “left” and “right.” So water coming from above is led rightward toward (3,3).\n \n9. At (3,3) (again a “┏”) using 0 rotations water entering from the left gets sent to the right, toward (3,4).\n \n10. At (3,4) (also a “┏”) we now rotate it 2 times so that its connections become “bottom,” “right” and “left.” Water comes in from the left and leaves downward into (4,4).\n \n11. Finally, at (4,4) we have an L pipe. Using 0 rotations it connects “top” and “right.” Water entering from above is led out to the right; this is the designated ending point.\n\nFor every cell that is not part of–and not touched by–the main water route we simply choose 0 rotations.\n\nThus the full 5×5 grid (rows listed in order, with the rotation chosen for that cell) is taken as follows:\n\nRow0: (0,0)=2 , (0,1)=0 , (0,2)=0 , (0,3)=0 , (0,4)=0  \nRow1: (1,0)=0 , (1,1)=0 , (1,2)=0 , (1,3)=0 , (1,4)=0  \nRow2: (2,0)=0 , (2,1)=1 , (2,2)=2 , (2,3)=0 , (2,4)=0  \nRow3: (3,0)=0 , (3,1)=0 , (3,2)=0 , (3,3)=0 , (3,4)=2  \nRow4: (4,0)=0 , (4,1)=3 , (4,2)=0 , (4,3)=0 , (4,4)=0\n\nWhen written as one list in one line (with rows separated by commas) the answer is:\n\nAnswer: [[2,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,2,0,0],[0,0,0,0,2],[0,3,0,0,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

(Note that the board has 5 rows and 5 columns.) One acceptable solution is to force a “main path”––that is, choose rotations on a “snake‐like” route that goes down from (0,0) then eventually across and up so that eventually the water “re‐enters” row 3 and finally goes down into row 4 and out the right of (4,4).\n\nOne way to get a valid “pipe–connection” is as follows (using our “pipe–notation” and taking into account that a 90° clockwise rotation “shifts” the connection directions):\n\n• The L–piece (which originally connects Top and Right) can be made to connect Bottom and Left by applying 2 rotations (because rotation 2 gives [Bottom, Left]).  \n• The vertical “|” (starting with Top–Bottom) may be “kept” (0 rotations) if traveling vertically or “turned” (with 1 rotation) to get the Left–Right connection.  \n• The ┏–piece (which originally connects Top, Left and Right) has four possibilities. For example, rotation 0 is (Top, Left, Right), rotation 1 is (Top, Right, Bottom), rotation 2 is (Right, Bottom, Left) and rotation 3 is (Top, Left, Bottom).\n\nI decided on a solution in which the “main path” uses the following cells (with “path cell (r,c) = chosen rotation”):\n\n (0,0) is an L–piece. To “accept” the start from the left and then send water downward it must include Left and Bottom. (For L the only possibility is rotation 2: [Bottom, Left].)  \n (1,0) is “|” (vertical) and the water coming from above goes down (rotation 0 = [Top,Bottom]).  \n (2,0) is “|” (rotation 0).  \n (3,0) is “|” (rotation 0).  \n (4,0) is an L–piece. Here water comes from above so we want an orientation that has Top and Right. (The default L (rotation 0 = [Top,Right]) does exactly that.)  \n (4,1) is a “|” but here we need to go horizontally. So we rotate it once (rotation 1 gives [Left,Right]).  \n (4,2) is a ┏–piece on the “path.” We want water coming in from the Left (from (4,1)) to “turn” upward (so that the extra branch does not extend to the right). One acceptable choice is rotation 3 for ┏ (which gives [Left,Bottom,Top]). That lets the water “exit” upward toward row 3.  \n (3,2) is an L–piece. By expecting water from below (from (4,2)) and wanting to continue rightward we can use rotation 1 (for an L, rotation 1 gives [Right,Bottom] so that water entering from Bottom can leave Right).  \n (3,3) is a ┏–piece. Water comes in from the Left (from (3,2)); we choose rotation 0 (which is [Top,Left,Right]) so that it can continue rightward.  \n (3,4) is a ┏–piece. To “turn” from left to down (heading toward the final row) we use rotation 2 (which gives [Right,Bottom,Left]).  \n (4,4) is an L–piece. Water comes in from above so we want an orientation [Top,Right] (which is the default, rotation 0) so that water can exit to the right (the goal).\n\nFor all cells not “used” in our intended path we may simply leave them “as is” (that is, with 0 rotations) since the puzzle simply requires that one valid connection exists from the start to the finish.\n\nThus one full 5×5 list of rotations is as follows (row‐by‐row, with the “path” cells replaced by their chosen rotations):\n\nRow0: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow3: [0, 0, 1, 0, 2]\nRow4: [0, 1, 3, 0, 0]\n\nWhen written on one line in the required format the answer is:\n\nAnswer: [[2,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,2],[0,1,3,0,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

(Note: To simplify things, I choose the rotations of the pipes that lie directly on the solution path so that the water entering one cell has a properly matching exit into the next cell. Cells that are not on the “solution” path can be left unrotated (rotation 0) because they don’t affect the flow.) \n\nHere is one possible solution using the following assumptions:\n• Our grid is 4×4. Based on the board text, we interpret the rows as:  \n  Row0: [|, ┏, |, L]  \n  Row1: [L, ┏, L, ┏]  \n  Row2: [|, L, |, ┏]   (the blank in row2 is interpreted as a “|”)  \n  Row3: [L, |, L, L]  \n   \n• The pipes come “unrotated” with these connections:  \n  – L (zero rotation) connects top and right.  \n  – | (zero rotation) connects top and bottom.  \n  – ┏ (zero rotation) connects top, left, and right.  \n   \n• A “90° clockwise rotation” reassigns the connected directions as follows:  \n  For L:  \n   Rotation 0: top and right  \n   Rotation 1: right and bottom  \n   Rotation 2: bottom and left  \n   Rotation 3: left and top  \n  For |:  \n   Rotation 0 (or 2): top and bottom  \n   Rotation 1 (or 3): left and right  \n  For ┏:  \n   Rotation 0: top, left, right  \n   Rotation 1: top, right, bottom  \n   Rotation 2: bottom, right, left  \n   Rotation 3: left, bottom, top  \n\nMy idea was to “thread” a connected route that goes from cell (0,0) to cell (3,3) as follows:\n\n1. At (0,0) (type “|”), the start’s inlet comes from the left. Since in its default position | does not have a left, we must rotate it so that it becomes left–right. For | this is achieved with a 90° clockwise rotation (or 270°; I choose 1).  \n  (0,0): rotation = 1 → connections: left, right.\n\n2. Now water flows right into (0,1) (type “┏”). We need (0,1) to accept from left. Its non‐rotated configuration (rotation 0) already has left (as well as top and right). We then let the water continue right.\n  (0,1): rotation = 0 → connections: top, left, right.\n\n3. Water reaches (0,2) (type “|”). To accept water from its left, we use a 90° rotation so that it connects left and right.\n  (0,2): rotation = 1 → connections: left, right.\n\n4. At (0,3) (type “L”), the water arrives from the left. L in its default (rotation 0) is top–right (no left). Instead, using 2 rotations, L connects bottom and left. That works because water can come in from left and then exit downward.\n  (0,3): rotation = 2 → connections: left, bottom.\n\n5. The water now drops into (1,3) (type “┏”) from the top. To accept from the top, one may use either rotation 0, 1, or 3. However, we want to continue downward so that the water eventually reaches the bottom row; rotation 1 (which gives top, right, bottom) serves well.\n  (1,3): rotation = 1 → connections: top, right, bottom.\n\n6. The water flows downward into (2,3) (type “┏”). Again, water enters from the top. To continue downward (or eventually exit right later), we choose rotation 1.\n  (2,3): rotation = 1 → connections: top, right, bottom.\n\n7. Finally, water enters (3,3) (type “L”) from the top. For L to accept from top and send water out the right side (the required exit), the default (rotation 0: top and right) is perfect.\n  (3,3): rotation = 0 → connections: top, right.\n\nFor all other cells that are not on the solution path, I simply leave them as originally given (rotation 0).\n\nThus the complete 4×4 grid of rotations is arranged as follows (each number represents how many 90° clockwise rotations are applied):\n\nRow0: [1, 0, 1, 2]  \nRow1: [0, 0, 0, 1]  \nRow2: [0, 0, 0, 1]  \nRow3: [0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis means the water flows from the left of (0,0) → (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) then downward via (1,3) and (2,3) into (3,3) and finally exits to the right of (3,3).\n\nAnswer: [[1,0,1,2],[0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I found a continuous route from the starting point (entering (0,0) from the left) to the exit (leaving (5,5) to the right) by “choosing” rotations for the pipes along one possible path and “leaving” the other pipes in their default orientation (rotation 0). For example, starting at (0,0) the vertical pipe “|” cannot accept an entry from the left unless it is turned 90° (rotation 1) so that it becomes horizontal (opening left and right). Then the next cell (0,1) holds an L‐pipe (whose “natural” orientation connects top and right). In order to accept a connection coming from the left and “turn downward” (since going straight right is not possible with an elbow), we rotate that pipe twice (rotation 2) so it connects bottom and left. Continuing this process so that every pipe in the “solution path” connects with its neighbor – for example, at (1,1) an L with no rotation (rotation 0) accepts a top connection and gives a right opening, and so on – we obtain a route that eventually enters (5,5) from its left. At the goal (5,5) a ┏‐pipe rotated 0 (which has openings in the top, left and right) lets the water exit to the right on the border. \n\nFor simplicity the cells that are not needed in the solution have been kept in their “default” rotation (0). (Note that some puzzles of this type demand every pipe be “correct” (i.e. no unused open ends), but here the only requirement is to have at least one valid connection from start to finish.)\n\nThe chosen rotations along the “solution path” are:\n• (0,0) “|”: rotation 1 (to become horizontal, with left\/right).\n• (0,1) “L”: rotation 2 (to have left and bottom); \n• (1,1) “L”: rotation 0 (top\/right) so that the top connects from (0,1)’s bottom entering (1,1) and then water exits right.\n• (1,2) “┏”: rotation 0 (top\/left\/right) so that a connection from left goes to right.\n• (1,3) “L”: rotation 2 (bottom\/left) so that water coming from the left goes down.\n• (2,3) “|”: rotation 0 (vertical) so that water coming from top goes downward.\n• (3,3) “|”: rotation 0 likewise.\n• (4,3) “L”: rotation 0 (top\/right) so that an entry from top exits to right.\n• (4,4) “L”: rotation 2 (bottom\/left) to “turn” downward.\n• (5,4) “L”: rotation 0 (top\/right) so that an entry from top goes to right.\n• (5,5) “┏”: rotation 0 so that an entry from the left can exit to the right (the goal).\n\nAll the other cells we simply assign a rotation 0.
