Pipe at `(0,1)` is `L`, default **top-right** connection. To connect left-to-bottom, rotate it **3 times**.\n3. Pipe at `(0,2)` is `┏`, default **top-left-right** connection. To connect left-to-bottom, rotate it **1 time**.\n4. Pipe at `(0,3)` is `┏`, default **top-left-right** connection. To connect top-to-left, rotate it **0 times**.\n5. Pipe at `(0,4)` is `┏`, default **top-left-right** connection. To connect top-to-left, rotate it **0 times**.\n6. Pipe at `(0,5)` is `L`, default **top-right** connection. To connect top-to-left, rotate it **2 times**.\n\n...
