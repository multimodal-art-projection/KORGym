The key is to ensure a continuous path through the grid by aligning the connections of adjacent pipes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Pipe Connections**: Each pipe type (L, |, ┏) has specific initial connections.

The solution involves analyzing the connections of each pipe type and their rotations to ensure a continuous path.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Pipe Types and Rotations**:\n   - `|` (vertical) rotated 1 or 3 times becomes horizontal (connects left-right).\n   - `L` (top-right) rotated 2 times connects bottom-left.\n   - `┏` (top-left-right) rotated 1 time connects right-top-bottom.\n\n2. **Path Analysis**:\n   - Start at the left of (0,0). The first pipe (0,0) must connect left-right (rotated 1).\n   - The path proceeds right through (0,1) and (0,2), both rotated 1 (left-right).\n   - (0,3) (L) is rotated 2 to connect bottom-left, directing the path down to (1,3).\n   - (1,3) (┏) is rotated 1 to connect top-bottom, directing the path down to (2,3).\n   - (2,3) (┏) is rotated 1 to connect top-bottom, directing the path down to (3,3).\n   - (3,3) (L) is rotated 0 to connect top-right, reaching the goal (right of (3,3)).\n\n### Rotations for Each Cell:\n- Row 0: [1, 1, 1, 2] (horizontal connections for (0,0)-(0,2); L rotated 2 for (0,3))\n- Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 1] (no rotation for (1,0)-(1,2); ┏ rotated 1 for (1,3))\n- Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 1] (no rotation for (2,0)-(2,2); ┏ rotated 1 for (2,3))\n- Row 3: [0, 0, 0, 0] (no rotation for all cells; L rotated 0 for (3,3))\n\nAnswer: [[1,1,1,2],[0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
