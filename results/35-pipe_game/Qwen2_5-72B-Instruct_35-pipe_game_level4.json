The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: [[0,1,1,3...],[1,3,2,3...],...]'.\n\nGiven three types of pipes with the following initial connections:  \n- L connects the top and right sides  \n- | connects the top and bottom sides  \n- ┏ connects the top, left, and right sides  \n\nYou are provided with an n x n grid, where each cell contains one type of pipe. The starting point is to the left of position (0,0), and the goal is to reach the right side of position (n-1,n-1). Players need to rotate the pipes in the grid to ensure a valid connection from the start to the end.\n\nYour task is to output an n x n list in one line, where each element indicates the number of 90° clockwise rotations (0, 1, 2, or 3) applied to the pipe at that position.  \nFor example:  \n'Answer: [[0,1,1,3...],[1,3,2,3...],...]'\nBoard:\n| | | L\nL | | ┏\n┏ | ┏ ┏\nL | L L\n","epoch":1,"puzzle_grid":[["|","|","|","L"],["L","|","|","┏"],["┏","|","┏","┏"],["L","|","L","L"]],"grid_size":4,"endpoints":{"start":[0,0],"end":[3,3]},"seed":49,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
