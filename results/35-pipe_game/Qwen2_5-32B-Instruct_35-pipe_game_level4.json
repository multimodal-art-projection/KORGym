The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: [[0,1,1,3...],[1,3,2,3...],...]'.\n\nGiven three types of pipes with the following initial connections:  \n- L connects the top and right sides  \n- | connects the top and bottom sides  \n- ┏ connects the top, left, and right sides  \n\nYou are provided with an n x n grid, where each cell contains one type of pipe. The starting point is to the left of position (0,0), and the goal is to reach the right side of position (n-1,n-1). Players need to rotate the pipes in the grid to ensure a valid connection from the start to the end.\n\nYour task is to output an n x n list in one line, where each element indicates the number of 90° clockwise rotations (0, 1, 2, or 3) applied to the pipe at that position.  \nFor example:  \n'Answer: [[0,1,1,3...],[1,3,2,3...],...]'\nBoard:\n| | | L\nL | | ┏\n┏ | ┏ ┏\nL | L L\n","answer":"[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]","score":0,"is_end":true,"action":"[[0,0,0,1],[1,0,0,3],[3,0,3,3],[1,0,1,1]]","response":["To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times each pipe needs to be rotated so that there's a continuous path from the left side of the grid (left of position (0,0)) to the right side of the grid (right of position (n-1,n-1)). \n\nHere’s the initial configuration of the pipes:\n```\n| | | L\nL | | ┏\n┏ | ┏ ┏\nL | L L\n```\n\nWe will analyze each cell to find a way to connect them from the starting point to the endpoint.\n\n1. **First row**: We need to connect from the left side to the right side of the first cell. Since it is a vertical pipe (|), no rotation is needed.\n2. **Second row**: The second cell needs to connect from the top to the right side. This requires rotating the pipe (L) once to make it connect horizontally to the right.\n3. **Third row**: For the third cell, we need to connect from the top to the right side. This also requires rotating the pipe (L) once.\n4. **Fourth row**: The fourth cell needs to connect from the top to the right side. No rotation is needed for the vertical pipe (|).\n\nFollowing this logic, we can determine the rotations needed for each cell:\n\n- First row: `|`, `|`, `|`, `L` -> [0, 0, 0, 1]\n- Second row: `L`, `|`, `|`, `┓` -> [1, 0, 0, 3]\n- Third row: `┓`, `|`, `┓`, `┓` -> [3, 0, 3, 3]\n- Fourth row: `L`, `|`, `L`, `L` -> [1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nAnswer: [[0,0,0,1],[1,0,0,3],[3,0,3,3],[1,0,1,1]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
