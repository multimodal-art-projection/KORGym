The only possibilities are rotation 2 (bottom, left) or rotation 3 (left, top). Rotation 3 would send flow upward (off the board), so use rotation 2. Flow now goes downward to (1,0).  \n\n2) Positions (1,0), (2,0), (3,0) are all '|' (top–bottom).  \n   - '|' rotations:  \n     • 0 or 2 → (top, bottom)  \n     • 1 or 3 → (left, right)  \n   - Keeping them at rotation 0 (vertical) carries flow straight down each time until (4,0).  \n\n3) At (4,0), which is 'L', flow arrives from above. We need to exit to the right. The base orientation of 'L' = (top, right) works perfectly for that. So 0 rotations sends flow rightward to (4,1).  \n\n4) At (4,1), which is '|', we are now entering from the left. Hence we need a left–right connection. That means a rotation of 1 (or 3). Choose 1 to get (left, right), sending flow to (4,2).  \n\n5) At (4,2), which is '┏' (base = top, left, right), we again enter from the left and want to exit to the right. Its base orientation (0 rotations) = (top, left, right) suffices to continue rightward to (4,3).  \n\n6) At (4,3), which is 'L', we enter from the left. No rotation of 'L' offers left–right directly, so we must turn upward (or downward). Downward would leave the board, so we go up. The orientation that has (left, top) is rotation 3. That sends flow upward to (3,3).  \n\n7) At (3,3), which is '┏' (base = top, left, right), we come from below so we need a bottom connection. One valid orientation is rotation 1 → (top, right, bottom). That takes flow from bottom to right, going to (3,4).  \n\n8) At (3,4), which is '┏', we enter from the left. We need an orientation with left and bottom to drop into (4,4). Rotation 2 → (right, bottom, left) does exactly that.  \n\n9) Finally, at (4,4), which is 'L', we arrive from the top and must exit on the right. The base orientation 0 → (top, right) gives exactly that exit.  \n\nAll unused cells can remain at 0 rotations (no particular constraint other than not breaking the path above).
