The pipe is 'L'. We need to rotate it 0 times to connect from the left and pass rightwards. So, the number of rotations for (1,2) is 0.\n- **Cell (1,3)**: The previous pipe is sending the connection rightwards. The pipe is 'L'. We need to rotate it 0 times to connect from the left and pass rightwards. So, the number of rotations for (1,3) is 0.\n\n### Analyzing the third row\n- **Cell (2,0)**: The previous pipe is sending the connection downwards. The pipe is '|'. We need to rotate it 0 times to connect from the top and pass downwards. So, the number of rotations for (2,0) is 0.\n- **Cell (2,1)**: The previous pipe is sending the connection downwards. The pipe is 'L'. We need to rotate it 1 time clock - wise so that it can connect from the top and pass rightwards. So, the number of rotations for (2,1) is 1.\n- **Cell (2,2)**: There is an empty cell, which is not a valid pipe. For the sake of the algorithm, we assume it is a pipe that doesn't disrupt the connection. Let's assume it is a pipe that can connect in any way we need. In this case, we can consider it as a pipe that doesn't need rotation (0).\n- **Cell (2,3)**: The previous pipe (if we assume the connection is coming from the left) is sending the connection rightwards. The pipe is 'L'. We need to rotate it 0 times to connect from the left and pass rightwards. So, the number of rotations for (2,3) is 0.\n\n### Analyzing the fourth row\n- **Cell (3,0)**: The previous pipe is sending the connection downwards. The pipe is 'L'. We need to rotate it 2 times clock - wise so that it can connect from the top and pass rightwards. So, the number of rotations for (3,0) is 2.\n- **Cell (3,1)**: The previous pipe is sending the connection rightwards. The pipe is '|'. We need to rotate it 1 time clock - wise so that it can connect from the left and pass downwards. So, the number of rotations for (3,1) is 1.\n- **Cell (3,2)**: The previous pipe is sending the connection downwards. The pipe is 'L'. We need to rotate it 3 times clock - wise so that it can connect from the top and pass rightwards. So, the number of rotations for (3,2) is 3.\n- **Cell (3,3)**: The previous pipe is sending the connection rightwards. The pipe is 'L'. We need to rotate it 0 times to connect from the left and pass rightwards to the end point. So, the number of rotations for (3,3) is 0.\n\n\nThe list of the number of 90 - degree clockwise rotations for each cell is:\n```\n[[1, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [2, 1, 3, 0]]\n```\n\nAnswer: [[1, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [2, 1, 3, 0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Since we start from the left, we need to rotate it 1 or 3 times to connect to the left. We choose 1 rotation to connect to the starting point.\n\n2. **Cell (0, 1)**:\n    - The pipe is a ┏ - shaped pipe. After the straight pipe in (0, 0) is rotated once, it comes from the right. We need to rotate the ┏ - shaped pipe 1 time so that it can accept the connection from the right and continue the path.\n\n3. **Cell (0, 2)**:\n    - The pipe is a straight pipe (|). After the ┏ - shaped pipe in (0, 1) is rotated once,  it comes from the bottom. So we don't need to rotate the straight pipe, i.e., 0 rotations.\n\n4. **Cell (0, 3)**:\n    - The pipe is an L - shaped pipe. After the straight pipe in (0, 2), it comes from the top. We need to rotate it 1 time to continue the path downwards.\n\n5. **Cell (1, 3)**:\n    - The pipe is a ┏ - shaped pipe. After the L - shaped pipe in (0, 3) is rotated once, it comes from the bottom. We need to rotate it 2 times to continue the path to the left.\n\n6. **Cell (1, 2)**:\n    - The pipe is a straight pipe (|). After the ┏ - shaped pipe in (1, 3) is rotated twice, it comes from the right. We need to rotate it 1 time to continue the path upwards.\n\n7. **Cell (1, 1)**:\n    - The pipe is a ┏ - shaped pipe. After the straight pipe in (1, 2) is rotated once, it comes from the top. We need to rotate it 1 time to continue the path to the right.\n\n8. **Cell (1, 0)**:\n    - The pipe is an L - shaped pipe. After the ┏ - shaped pipe in (1, 1) is rotated once, it comes from the left. We need to rotate it 3 times to continue the path downwards.\n\n9. **Cell (2, 0)**:\n    - The pipe is a straight pipe (|). After the L - shaped pipe in (1, 0) is rotated 3 times, it comes from the top. We don't need to rotate it, i.e., 0 rotations.\n\n10. **Cell (2, 1)**:\n    - The pipe is an L - shaped pipe. After the straight pipe in (2, 0), it comes from the bottom. We need to rotate it 1 time to continue the path to the right.\n\n11. **Cell (2, 2)**:\n    - The pipe is a straight pipe (|). After the L - shaped pipe in (2, 1) is rotated once, it comes from the left. We need to rotate it 1 time to continue the path downwards.\n\n12. **Cell (2, 3)**:\n    - The pipe is a ┏ - shaped pipe. After the straight pipe in (2, 2) is rotated once, it comes from the bottom. We need to rotate it 2 times to continue the path to the left.\n\n13. **Cell (3, 3)**:\n    - The pipe is a ┏ - shaped pipe. After the ┏ - shaped pipe in (2, 3) is rotated twice, it comes from the right. We need to rotate it 1 time to reach the end point on the right side of (3, 3).\n\n14. **Cell (3, 2)**:\n    - The pipe is a straight pipe (|). After the ┏ - shaped pipe in (3, 3) is rotated once, it comes from the left. We need to rotate it 1 time to accept the connection from the left.\n\n15. **Cell (3, 1)**:\n    - The pipe is a ┏ - shaped pipe. After the straight pipe in (3, 2) is rotated once, it comes from the right. We need to rotate it 1 time to continue the path upwards.\n\n16. **Cell (3, 0)**:\n    - The pipe is an L - shaped pipe. After the ┏ - shaped pipe in (3, 1) is rotated once, it comes from the top. We need to rotate it 1 time to connect to the previous pipe.\n\n\nThe resulting 4x4 list of rotations is:\n```\n[[1, 1, 0, 1], [3, 1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1, 1]]\n```\n\nAnswer: [[1, 1, 0, 1], [3, 1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1, 1]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
