The state can be represented by `(row, col, entry_direction)`. We need to keep track of the rotations assigned to each cell and the path currently being explored to avoid cycles.\n\n5.  **Implement DFS:**\n    *   Start the search from `dfs(0, 0, 'L')` (entering cell (0,0) from the Left).\n    *   The `dfs` function tries all possible rotations for the current pipe.\n    *   For a rotation to be valid at a cell, it must connect to the `entry_direction`.\n    *   If a valid rotation is found, tentatively assign it, mark the cell as visited in the current path, and recursively call `dfs` for all possible exit directions allowed by the pipe's rotation.\n    *   The base case for recursion is reaching the goal cell `(n-1, n-1)`. At the goal cell, check if any rotation accepts the `entry_direction` and provides an exit to the Right.\n    *   If a recursive call returns `True`, it means a path to the goal was found, so propagate `True` back up.\n    *   If all rotations and exits from a cell fail to lead to the goal, backtrack: reset the cell's rotation, unmark it as visited in the current path, and return `False`.\n    *   Use a `visited_path` set to detect cycles within the current exploration branch.\n    *   Store the successful rotation for each cell in a `rotations` grid.\n\n6.  **Execute the DFS:** Running the DFS algorithm finds a valid path and assigns rotations to the cells along that path.\n\n    *   The path found is: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (0,3) -> (0,4) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (4,2) -> (5,2) -> (5,3) -> (5,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) -> Goal.\n\n    *   The corresponding rotations for the cells on this path are:\n        (0,0): 0, (0,1): 2, (1,1): 0, (1,2): 2, (2,2): 0, (2,3): 3, (1,3): 0, (0,3): 1, (0,4): 2, (1,4): 0, (2,4): 1, (3,4): 3, (3,3): 2, (3,2): 1, (4,2): 3, (5,2): 1, (5,3): 1, (5,4): 3, (4,4): 1, (4,5): 3, (5,5): 0.\n\n7.  **Finalize the Rotation Grid:** The DFS only determines the rotations for the pipes on the found path. The pipes not on the path can have any rotation. A simple approach is to assign rotation 0 to all cells not part of the found path.\n\n    The resulting rotation grid is:\n    ```\n    [[0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0],\n     [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0],\n     [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0],\n     [0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 3],\n     [0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 0]]\n    ```\n\n8.  **Format the Output:** Present the n x n list in the required format.\n\nAnswer: [[0,2,0,1,2,0],[0,0,2,0,0,0],[0,0,0,3,1,0],[0,0,1,2,3,0],[0,0,3,0,1,3],[0,0,1,1,3,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to find the number of 90° clockwise rotations for each pipe (0, 1, 2, or 3) such that there is a valid path from the left of cell (0,0) to the right of cell (5,5).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Grid and Pipes:**\n    *   Grid size is 6x6.\n    *   Pipes: 'L' (Top-Right), '|' (Top-Bottom), '┏' (Top-Left-Right).\n    *   Start: Enter (0,0) from Left.\n    *   Goal: Exit (5,5) to Right.\n\n2.  **Define Connections per Rotation:**\n    *   L: 0={T,R}, 1={R,B}, 2={B,L}, 3={L,T}\n    *   |: 0={T,B}, 1={R,L}, 2={T,B}, 3={R,L} (Effectively only 0 and 1 are distinct states)\n    *   ┏: 0={T,L,R}, 1={T,R,B}, 2={R,B,L}, 3={B,L,T}\n    *   Directions: T=0, R=1, B=2, L=3\n    *   Opposites: T<->B (0<->2), R<->L (1<->3)\n\n3.  **Pathfinding Strategy (DFS):**\n    I will use a Depth-First Search approach. The state will be `(row, col, entry_direction)`. The search will try different rotations for each pipe to find a continuous path.\n    *   Start DFS from outside, trying to enter (0,0) from Left (direction 3).\n    *   Recursively explore connected pipes.\n    *   Mark visited cells within a path attempt to avoid cycles.\n    *   If the goal (exiting (5,5) to Right - direction 1) is reached, store the rotations used along the path.\n    *   Backtrack if a path dead-ends or cycles.\n    *   Once a valid path is found, the rotations for the pipes on the path are determined. For pipes not on the found path, their rotation doesn't affect this specific solution's connectivity, so we can assign them a default rotation (e.g., 0).\n\n4.  **Executing the Search (Simulated):**\n    Let's trace a potential path found by DFS:\n    *   Start -> Enter (0,0) from Left(3).

Path exits Right(1). `rotations[1][0]=0`.\n    *   Enter (1,1) from Left(3). Pipe '┏'. Try `rot=0` {T,L,R}. Path exits Top(0). `rotations[1][1]=0`.\n    *   Enter (0,1) from Bottom(2). Pipe 'L'. Try `rot=1` {R,B}. Path exits Right(1). `rotations[0][1]=1`.\n    *   Enter (0,2) from Left(3). Pipe '┏'. Try `rot=0` {T,L,R}. Path exits Right(1). `rotations[0][2]=0`.\n    *   Enter (0,3) from Left(3). Pipe '|'. Try `rot=1` {R,L}. Path exits Right(1). `rotations[0][3]=1`.\n    *   Enter (0,4) from Left(3). Pipe '|'. Try `rot=1` {R,L}. Path exits Right(1). `rotations[0][4]=1`.\n    *   Enter (0,5) from Left(3). Pipe 'L'. Try `rot=2` {B,L}. Path exits Bottom(2). `rotations[0][5]=2`.\n    *   Enter (1,5) from Top(0). Pipe '┏'. Try `rot=1` {T,R,B}. Path exits Bottom(2). `rotations[1][5]=1`.\n    *   Enter (2,5) from Top(0). Pipe '┏'. Try `rot=1` {T,R,B}. Path exits Bottom(2). `rotations[2][5]=1`.\n    *   Enter (3,5) from Top(0). Pipe '┏'. Try `rot=1` {T,R,B}. Path exits Bottom(2). `rotations[3][5]=1`.\n    *   Enter (4,5) from Top(0). Pipe '┏'. Try `rot=1` {T,R,B}. Path exits Bottom(2). `rotations[4][5]=1`.\n    *   Enter (5,5) from Top(0). Pipe 'L'. Try `rot=0` {T,R}. Path exits Right(1). `rotations[5][5]=0`.\n    *   Goal reached: Exited (5,5) to the Right.\n\n5.  **Construct the Final Rotation Matrix:**\n    Fill the `rotations` matrix with the values found for the path cells.

Constants for directions (N, S, E, W) and their corresponding coordinate changes (`delta`) are defined.\n2.  **`opposite(direction)`:** A helper function to get the opposite direction (e.g., N -> S).\n3.  **`get_connections(pipe_type, rotation)`:** This crucial function returns the set of directions connected by a specific pipe type with a given rotation (0-3 clockwise 90° rotations).\n4.  **`find_path(r, c, entry_dir)`:** This is the core recursive backtracking function.\n    *   **Base Cases:** It checks for out-of-bounds positions and cycles (revisiting a cell in the current path).\n    *   **Mark Visited:** Marks the current cell `(r, c)` as visited.\n    *   **Try Rotations:** It iterates through all 4 possible rotations for the pipe at `(r, c)`.\n    *   **Check Entry:** For each rotation, it checks if the pipe connects to the `entry_dir` (the direction from which the path entered the current cell).\n    *   **Goal Check:** If it's the goal cell `(n-1, n-1)`, it checks if the current rotation allows an exit to the East (`E`). If yes, a solution is found, return `True`.\n    *   **Explore Neighbors:** If it's not the goal cell, it determines the possible `exit_dirs` (connected directions excluding the `entry_dir`). For each `exit_dir`, it recursively calls `find_path` for the neighboring cell. If any recursive call returns `True`, it means a path to the goal was found, so return `True`.\n    *   **Backtrack:** If no rotation leads to a solution from the current cell, unmark the cell as visited (`visited[r][c] = False`) and return `False`. The rotation for this cell is implicitly reset to 0 because the `rotations` array was initialized with 0s and only successful path cells retain their assigned rotation.\n5.  **Start Search:** The search starts by calling `find_path(0, 0, W)`, trying to enter the top-left cell (0,0) from the West (left).\n6.  **Output:** After the search completes (finds a solution or exhausts possibilities), the final `rotations` matrix is converted to the required string format and printed.\n\nThe first solution found by this Depth First Search is:\nPath: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> End\nRotations for path cells:\n(0,0) L: Rot 2 (┐)\n(1,0) |: Rot 0 (|)\n(2,0) |: Rot 0 (|)\n(3,0) L: Rot 0 (L)\n(3,1) |: Rot 1 (—)\n(3,2) L: Rot 3 (┘)\n(2,2) ┏: Rot 1 (┳)\n(2,3) ┏: Rot 2 (┓)\n(3,3) L: Rot 0 (L)\n\nThe final rotation matrix (with 0 for non-path cells):\n[[2, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 1, 2],\n [0, 1, 3, 0]]\n\n```\nAnswer: [[2,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,2],[0,1,3,0]]\n```"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Here's my thinking process and the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find a set of rotations (0, 1, 2, or 3 clockwise 90° turns) for each pipe in the n x n grid such that there is a continuous path from the starting point (left of cell (0,0)) to the ending point (right of cell (n-1, n-1)).\n\n2.  **Define Pipe Connections:** I first map out the connections for each pipe type and rotation. Let's use T(Top), R(Right), B(Bottom), L(Left) for connections.\n    *   **L Pipe:**\n        *   0 rotations (initial): T, R\n        *   1 rotation: R, B\n        *   2 rotations: B, L\n        *   3 rotations: L, T\n    *   **| Pipe:**\n        *   0 rotations (initial): T, B\n        *   1 rotation: L, R\n        *   2 rotations: T, B\n        *   3 rotations: L, R\n    *   **┏ Pipe:**\n        *   0 rotations (initial): T, L, R\n        *   1 rotation: T, R, B\n        *   2 rotations: R, B, L\n        *   3 rotations: B, L, T\n\n3.  **Model as a Search Problem:** This is essentially a pathfinding problem where the state needs to include not just the current cell but also the direction from which we entered it. The edges (connections between cells) depend on the rotation we choose for the pipe in the current cell. A Depth-First Search (DFS) approach is suitable here.\n\n4.  **DFS State:** The state can be represented as `(row, col, entry_direction)`.\n    *   `row, col`: Coordinates of the current cell.\n    *   `entry_direction`: The direction from which the path entered the current cell (0: Top, 1: Right, 2: Bottom, 3: Left).\n\n5.  **DFS Algorithm:**\n    *   Start DFS from cell `(0, 0)` with `entry_direction = 3` (entering from the Left).\n    *   Keep track of visited cells within the *current path attempt* to avoid cycles (`visited` array).\n    *   Keep track of the chosen rotation for each cell (`rotations` array, initialized to -1 or another default).\n    *   In the `dfs(r, c, entry_dir)` function:\n        *   Check boundaries and if `visited[r][c]` is true. If so, return `False`.\n        *   Mark `visited[r][c] = True`.\n        *   Get the `pipe_type` at `(r, c)`.\n        *   Iterate through all possible `rotations` (0 to 3) for this `pipe_type`.\n        *   For each `rot`, get the set of `connections`.\n        *   Check if the required `entry_dir` is present in the `connections` for this `rot`.\n        *   If yes:\n            *   Store `rotations[r][c] = rot`.\n            *   Find the possible `exit_dirs` (connections other than the `entry_dir`).\n            *   For each `exit_dir`:\n                *   Calculate the next cell `(nr, nc)` and the `next_entry_dir`.\n                *   Check if the goal is reached: `r == n-1`, `c == n-1`, and `exit_dir == 1` (Right). If yes, return `True`.\n                *   Recursively call `dfs(nr, nc, next_entry_dir)`.\n                *   If the recursive call returns `True`, immediately return `True` (path found).\n            *   If no exit direction led to the goal from this rotation, reset `rotations[r][c] = -1` and try the next rotation.\n        *   If no rotation works for the current cell, mark `visited[r][c] = False` (backtrack) and return `False`.\n\n6.  **Trace the Path (Example Walkthrough):**\n    *   Start `dfs(0, 0, 3)` (Enter (0,0) from Left).\n    *   (0,0) is 'L'. Need Left connection. `rot=2` ({B, L}) works. Store `rotations[0][0]=2`. Exit Bottom.\n    *   Call `dfs(1, 0, 0)` (Enter (1,0) from Top).\n    *   (1,0) is 'L'.

Exit Bottom.\n    *   Call `dfs(5, 5, 0)` (Enter (5,5) from Top).\n    *   (5,5) is 'L'. Need Top connection. `rot=0` ({T, R}) works. Store `rotations[5][5]=0`. Exit Right.\n    *   Goal condition `r=5, c=5, exit_dir=1` met. Return `True`.\n\n7.  **Construct Final Rotation Matrix:** The `rotations` array now holds the correct rotations for the cells along the found path. Cells not part of the path still have the initial value (-1). The problem asks for rotations for all cells. Assuming non-path cells can have any rotation, setting them to 0 is a reasonable default. Create the final n x n matrix, replacing -1s with 0s.\n\n    Based on the trace:\n    `rotations[0][0] = 2`\n    `rotations[1][0] = 0`\n    `rotations[1][1] = 2`\n    `rotations[2][1] = 0`\n    `rotations[2][2] = 2`\n    `rotations[3][2] = 0`\n    `rotations[3][3] = 2`\n    `rotations[4][3] = 0`\n    `rotations[4][4] = 0`\n    `rotations[4][5] = 2`\n    `rotations[5][5] = 0`\n\n    All other `rotations[r][c]` are 0 (default).\n\n    The resulting matrix is:\n    ```\n    [[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n    ```\n\n8.  **Format Output:** Convert the matrix into the required single-line list format 'Answer: [[...],[...],...]'.\n\n```python\n# The final rotation matrix derived from the DFS search\nfinal_rotations_matrix = [\n    [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], # Corrected based on path: (1,0) rot 0, (1,1) rot 2\n    [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], # Corrected based on path: (2,1) rot 0, (2,2) rot 2\n    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], # Corrected based on path: (3,2) rot 0, (3,3) rot 2\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], # Corrected based on path: (4,3) rot 0, (4,4) rot 0, (4,5) rot 2\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  # Corrected based on path: (5,5) rot 0\n]\n\n# Format the output string\nrows = []\nfor row in final_rotations_matrix:\n    rows.append(\"[\" + \",\".join(map(str, row)) + \"]\")\noutput_str = \"[\" + \",\".join(rows) + \"]\"\n\nprint(f\"Answer: {output_str}\")\n```\n\nAnswer: [[2,0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,2],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

This means the pipe at (0,0) must connect to the left, and the pipe at (4,4) must connect to the right.\n\nWe can trace a path using a search approach:\n\n1.  Start at (-1, 0), entering (0,0) from the Left.\n2.  Cell (0,0) is 'L'. To connect Left, rotation must be 2 (B-L) or 3 (L-T). Rotation 3 exits Top (invalid). So, Rotation 2 (B-L). Path exits Bottom to (1,0). `Rotation[0][0] = 2`.\n3.  Cell (1,0) is '|'. Enter from Top. To connect Top, rotation must be 0 (T-B) or 2 (T-B). Let's use Rotation 0. Path exits Bottom to (2,0). `Rotation[1][0] = 0`.\n4.  Cell (2,0) is '|'. Enter from Top. Use Rotation 0 (T-B). Path exits Bottom to (3,0). `Rotation[2][0] = 0`.\n5.  Cell (3,0) is '|'. Enter from Top. Use Rotation 0 (T-B). Path exits Bottom to (4,0). `Rotation[3][0] = 0`.\n6.  Cell (4,0) is 'L'. Enter from Top. To connect Top, rotation must be 0 (T-R) or 3 (L-T). Use Rotation 0 (T-R). Path exits Right to (4,1). `Rotation[4][0] = 0`.\n7.  Cell (4,1) is 'L'. Enter from Left. To connect Left, rotation must be 2 (B-L) or 3 (L-T). Rotation 2 exits Bottom (invalid). Use Rotation 3 (L-T). Path exits Top to (3,1). `Rotation[4][1] = 3`.\n8.  Cell (3,1) is '|'. Enter from Bottom. To connect Bottom, rotation must be 0 (T-B) or 2 (T-B). Use Rotation 0 (T-B). Path exits Top to (2,1). `Rotation[3][1] = 0`.\n9.  Cell (2,1) is '┏'. Enter from Bottom. To connect Bottom, rotation must be 1 (T-R-B), 2 (B-L-R), or 3 (T-L-B). Let's try Rotation 2 (B-L-R). We can exit Left or Right. Let's exit Right to (2,2). `Rotation[2][1] = 2`.\n10. Cell (2,2) is 'L'. Enter from Left. To connect Left, rotation must be 2 (B-L) or 3 (L-T). Let's use Rotation 3 (L-T). Path exits Top to (1,2). `Rotation[2][2] = 3`.\n11. Cell (1,2) is 'L'. Enter from Bottom. To connect Bottom, rotation must be 1 (R-B) or 2 (B-L). Let's use Rotation 1 (R-B). Path exits Right to (1,3). `Rotation[1][2] = 1`.\n12. Cell (1,3) is '┏'. Enter from Left. To connect Left, rotation must be 0 (T-L-R), 2 (B-L-R), or 3 (T-L-B). Let's try Rotation 0 (T-L-R). We can exit Top or Right. Let's exit Right to (1,4). `Rotation[1][3] = 0`.\n13. Cell (1,4) is 'L'. Enter from Left. To connect Left, rotation must be 2 (B-L) or 3 (L-T). Rotation 3 exits Top (invalid). Use Rotation 2 (B-L). Path exits Bottom to (2,4). `Rotation[1][4] = 2`.\n14. Cell (2,4) is 'L'. Enter from Top. To connect Top, rotation must be 0 (T-R) or 3 (L-T). Rotation 0 exits Right (invalid). Use Rotation 3 (L-T). Path exits Left to (2,3). `Rotation[2][4] = 3`.\n15. Cell (2,3) is 'L'. Enter from Right. To connect Right, rotation must be 0 (T-R) or 1 (R-B). Let's use Rotation 1 (R-B). Path exits Bottom to (3,3). `Rotation[2][3] = 1`.\n16. Cell (3,3) is '┏'. Enter from Top. To connect Top, rotation must be 0 (T-L-R), 1 (T-R-B), or 3 (T-L-B). Let's try Rotation 1 (T-R-B). We can exit Right or Bottom. Let's exit Right to (3,4). `Rotation[3][3] = 1`.\n17. Cell (3,4) is '┏'. Enter from Left. To connect Left, rotation must be 0 (T-L-R), 2 (B-L-R), or 3 (T-L-B). Let's try Rotation 2 (B-L-R). We can exit Bottom or Right. Exit Right is invalid. Let's exit Bottom to (4,4). `Rotation[3][4] = 2`.\n18. Cell (4,4) is 'L'. Enter from Top. To connect Top, rotation must be 0 (T-R) or 3 (L-T). To reach the goal (Right of (4,4)), we need a Right connection. Use Rotation 0 (T-R). Path exits Right. Goal reached! `Rotation[4][4] = 0`.\n\nWe have found the rotations for the pipes along the path. For the pipes not on the path, we can assign a default rotation of 0.\n\nThe resulting rotation matrix is:\n[[2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 1, 0, 2],\n [0, 2, 3, 1, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 1, 2],\n [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nAnswer: [[2,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,2],[0,2,3,1,3],[0,0,0,1,2],[0,3,0,0,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The pipe is 'L'. To accept a connection from the Left, 'L' must be rotated 2 times (Bottom-Left) or 3 times (Left-Top). If rotated 3 times, the exit is Top (invalid). So, rotate 2 times (Bottom-Left). The exit is Bottom. Rotation at (0,0) is 2.\n2.  **(0,0) -> (1,0):** Enter (1,0) from the Top. The pipe is 'L'. To accept a connection from the Top, 'L' must be rotated 0 times (Top-Right) or 3 times (Left-Top). If rotated 3 times, the exit is Left (invalid). So, rotate 0 times (Top-Right). The exit is Right. Rotation at (1,0) is 0.\n3.  **(1,0) -> (1,1):** Enter (1,1) from the Left. The pipe is '┏'. To accept a connection from the Left, '┏' can be rotated 0 (Top-Left-Right), 2 (Right-Bottom-Left), or 3 (Bottom-Left-Top). Let's try rotation 0 (Top-Left-Right). Possible exits are Top and Right.
