Hence they will collaborate in minor round 8.  \n• There are no more minor rounds left in this major round, so any retaliation for cheating now would take place in the next major round—but the opponent cannot see past‑major history. Therefore there will be no retaliation.  \n• Cheating now yields +3 for us and –1 for them, strictly better than mutual collaboration (+0 : +0 for us).\n\nOptimal move: cheat.\n\nAnswer: cheat","The opponent is following a Tit‑for‑Tat strategy: they always start with “collaborate” in the first minor round of a major round and then copy whatever you did in the previous minor round. Against such an opponent, the highest long‑term payoff comes from collaborating in every round except the last one of the major round (where you cheat to gain +3 with no future retaliation).  \nSince this is the first minor round of the current major round (round 1 \/ 8), the optimal move is to collaborate.\n\nAnswer: collaborate","To maximize our total gain, we should maintain mutual cooperation until the last minor round (where we can defect without retaliation).  \nGiven the opponent’s Tit‑for‑Tat behaviour, defecting now would prompt them to defect next time, costing us more than we gain.  \nTherefore we should collaborate in this minor round.\n\nAnswer: collaborate","Answer: collaborate","Answer: collaborate","Answer: collaborate","Answer: collaborate","Answer: collaborate","Answer: cheat","Answer: collaborate","Answer: collaborate","Answer: collaborate","I will cheat in this minor round.  \nAnswer: cheat","The opponent’s behavior inside each major round is “tit‑for‑tat”: on every minor round they simply copy what you did in the previous minor round.  \nBecause you cheated in minor round 4, they will certainly cheat in the coming minor round 5.  \n\nYour options now:\n\n• If you cheat in round 5 ⇒ result 0 : 0, but they will cheat again in round 6. You either stay in mutual defection (all zeros) or pay –1 later to return to cooperation.  \n• If you collaborate in round 5 ⇒ you lose 1 now, but they return to collaboration in round 6. That lets you enjoy mutual +2 in rounds 6 & 7 and still steal +3 by cheating in the last round 8. This produces a net gain of +6 over the last four rounds, the best you can still obtain after your earlier defection.\n\nTherefore the optimal move in minor round 5 is to collaborate.\n\nAnswer: collaborate","Your opponent follows a Tit‑for‑Tat strategy: they begin each major round with “collaborate” and thereafter copy whatever you did in the immediately preceding minor round.  \nIn the current major round your last move (minor 5) was “collaborate”, so the opponent will “collaborate” in minor 6.  \n\nTo maximize total gain over the remaining three minor rounds, the best plan is:  \n• Minor 6 – collaborate (net +2)  \n• Minor 7 – collaborate (keeps opponent collaborating; net +2)  \n• Minor 8 – cheat (last move, no future retaliation; net +3)  \nTotal for the three moves: +7 coins, which is higher than any sequence starting with “cheat” now.\n\nTherefore, play “collaborate” in minor 6.\n\nAnswer: collaborate","Answer: collaborate","Answer: cheat","Answer: collaborate","The opponent is clearly using Tit‑for‑Tat: they begin each major round by collaborating and then simply mirror our previous move.  \nTo maximize our total profit in this final major round we should keep collaborating until the very last minor round (where we can safely cheat once).  \nTherefore, for Minor Round 2 we should collaborate.\n\nAnswer: collaborate","collaborate\n\nAnswer: collaborate","Answer: collaborate","Answer: collaborate","Answer: collaborate","Answer: collaborate","Answer: cheat"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
