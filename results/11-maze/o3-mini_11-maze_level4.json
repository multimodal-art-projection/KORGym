(Rows and columns are numbered starting at 0 with the top left cell being (0,0) and the bottom right cell – where the X is – being (12,12)). \n\nHere is one step‐by‑step explanation:\n\n1. Start at (0,0) which holds “I.”\n2. Move down repeatedly along column 0 until you reach row 10. That takes 10 moves:\n  (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (4,0) → (5,0) → (6,0) → (7,0) → (8,0) → (9,0) → (10,0).\n3. Then move right along row 10 (which is completely “o”) from column 0 to column 12. That is 12 consecutive “right” moves.\n4. Now from position (10,12) move down one cell to (11,12). (Note that row 11 is mostly blocked except at (11,2) and (11,12); our arrival is from above to (11,12).)\n5.

Notice that row1 is almost entirely blocked except at its very left (col 0) and right (col 12). In our solution we “drop” down the left side to eventually snake around and then later get to row10 in its left open region.\n2. Starting at (0,0) we go down into (1,0) and then (2,0). In row2 we move right into a cell such as (2,1) and (2,2) so that we can drop further in row3 (since row3 has open cell at col 2 but walls at col 0 and col 1).\n3. From (2,2) we move down to (3,2) then further down to (4,2). Here we “back‐up” left to get into the extreme left column by going from (4,2) left to (4,1) then to (4,0). (This step is needed because later the lower rows have a “friendly” passage at the very left.)\n4. From (4,0) we are free to continue straight down along the left edge. We then drop from (4,0) into (5,0), then (6,0), (7,0) and (8,0). \n5. At (8,0) rather than going right we continue down into (9,0) and then (10,0). In row10 the left‐side is open; we then head right into (10,1) and (10,2).\n6. Now from (10,2) drop one row to (11,2) (note that row11 is almost completely blocked except for col 0 and col 2).

For example, one valid solution is to exploit the open top row and then drop down on a column that leads us all the way right. (Note that there may be more than one valid route.) One valid route is as follows. In the maze below the row and column indices are numbered starting at 0. The start I is at (0,0) and the destination X is at (12,12).\n\nA quick look at the first row shows that every cell is open:\n Row 0: I o o o o o o o o o o o o\nSo we can begin by moving right along row 0. In particular, we can move right until cell (0,8). Then note that in row 1 the only open cells occur at columns 0, 4, 6, and 8. Thus at (0,8) we drop straight down into (1,8). From there the “down” direction continues to be open from row 1 into row 2 and then row 3 – we choose to continue downward since row 3, column 8 is open. Continuing downward into row 4 we arrive at (4,8). (You may verify from the maze strings that row 4, column 8 is 'o'.)\n\nAt (4,8) we have a choice. In our solution we choose to go right. In row 4 the cells from column 8 to column 12 are all open. So we go right four times from (4,8) to reach (4,12). Now (4,12) is on row 4 (fourth row numbered from 0) and, from that cell, going downward is allowed because (5,12) is an open cell. In fact, note that the rightmost column (column 12) is only blocked in a few rows; by dropping down from (4,12) we can reach (12,12) where X is located.\n\nSummarizing the moves step‐by‐step:\n • Start at (0,0)\n  – Move right eight times to go from (0,0) to (0,8)\n • Then move down four times:\n  (0,8) → (1,8) → (2,8) → (3,8) → (4,8)\n • Then move right four times:\n  (4,8) → (4,9) → (4,10) → (4,11) → (4,12)\n • Finally, move down eight times:\n  (4,12) → (5,12) → (6,12) → (7,12) → (8,12) → (9,12) → (10,12) → (11,12) → (12,12)\n\nTranslating these steps into the directions in order gives us:\n\nAnswer: ['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right',\n         'down', 'down', 'down', 'down',\n         'right', 'right', 'right', 'right',\n         'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']"],"prompt":"\nYou need to provide a path from the start point to the end point based on an n*n maze map that I provide.
