      "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this maze and find the path from the start 'I' to the destination 'X'. The maze is 3x3. Let me first visualize it.\n\nThe maze given is:\n\nRow 0: I o o\nRow 1: o * *\nRow 2: o o X\n\nWait, so rows are probably 0-based? Let me think. The first line is \"Ioo\", so first row. Then \"o**\", then \"ooX\". So the start is at (0,0). The destination is at (2,2).\n\nNow, the available moves are up, down, left, right. But need to make sure not to go out of bounds or into walls.\n\nLet me try to map out the positions step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's think about possible paths.\n\nFrom the start (0,0), possible moves are down or right. Because up or left would take it out of the maze.\n\nFirst, trying to explore possible paths. Let's see:\n\nOption 1: Right. From (0,0) to (0,1). Then maybe right again to (0,2). From there, can we move down? Let's check. (0,2) is row 0, column 2. Moving down to row 1, column 2. But row 1, column 2 is a '*' (wall), so that's blocked. From (0,2), possible moves are down (blocked), left (back to start), or maybe down to row 1, column 2 which is blocked. So maybe that's a dead end. So perhaps from (0,0), moving right isn't the best first step, but maybe part of the path.\n\nOption 2: Down from (0,0) to (1,0). Let's check what's there. The second row is o**, so (1,0) is 'o' which is passable. From (1,0), possible moves: up (back), down, left (invalid as column 0 can't go left), or right to (1,1) which is a '*' (wall). So from (1,0), down takes us to (2,0), which is 'o' (third row, first column). So moving down again. Now at (2,0). From here, possible moves: up (back to 1,0), down (invalid), left (invalid), right to (2,1) which is 'o'. So moving right to (2,1). Then from there, right again to (2,2), which is X. So that seems like a valid path.\n\nSo the path would be:\n\nStart (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,1) → right to (2,2). \n\nSo the moves would be 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right'. Let me check each step:\n\nOriginal position:\n\nRow 0: columns 0 (I), 1 (o), 2 (o)\nRow 1: 0 (o), 1 (*), 2 (*)\nRow 2: 0 (o), 1 (o), 2 (X)\n\nYes. Starting at 0,0.\n\nFirst move down to 1,0. Then down again to 2,0. Then right to 2,1. Then right to 2,2. That's four moves: down, down, right, right. \n\nIs there a shorter path? Let me check. Let's see if there's another way.\n\nAlternative path: from (0,0) go right to (0,1). Then down to (1,1)... but (1,1) is a wall. So that's blocked. From (0,1), can we move down? Row 1, column 1 is *, so no. So maybe from (0,1) move right to (0,2). From there, can't move down. Can we move down from (0,2) to row 1, column 2? That's a *, so no. So that's a dead end. So the only possible path is the down, down, right, right.\n\nSo the answer should be a list of moves: ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right'].\n\nLet me check again each step. Let me write the coordinates:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nFirst move 'down' takes to (1,0). Second 'down' to (2,0). Then 'right' to (2,1), then 'right' to (2,2). Yes. All those positions are passable. So that's correct. So the answer is that list.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this maze. The maze is 3x3. Let me first visualize it.\n\nThe maze is given as:\nRow 0: I o o\nRow 1: o *\nRow 2: o o X\n\nWait, actually, since it's n x n, and the input is three lines, each line represents a row. Let me write it out properly.\n\nRow 0: I o o\nRow 1: o * *\nRow 2: o o X\n\nWait, no. Wait the input is:\n\nMaze Board:\nIoo\no**\nooX\n\nSo each row is:\n\nRow 0: I o o\nRow 1: o * * \nRow 2: o o X\n\nSo the start is at (0,0). The destination is at (2,2).\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (2,2), moving only through 'o's, and not through 'X's or '*'s. The available moves are up, down, left, right. But since it's a grid, need to check boundaries.\n\nLet me think of possible paths.\n\nLet me first note the positions:\n\nStart at (0,0). Let's think of possible directions.\n\nFrom (0,0), possible moves:\n\nRight to (0,1), which is 'o' (allowed).\n\nDown to (1,0), which is 'o' (allowed).\n\nLeft is invalid (out of bounds). Up also invalid.\n\nSo two options: right or down.\n\nLet me try exploring possible paths.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (0,1). From there, possible moves:\n\nFrom (0,1), can move left back, right to (0,2), or down to (1,1) which is a wall. So right to (0,2) is allowed. (0,2) is 'o'.\n\nFrom (0,2), possible moves: left back, down to (1,2) which is a wall. Or right is out of bounds. Or up is out of bounds. So from (0,2), the only exit is left back. So this path seems stuck. Unless there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe from (0,2), can we go down? Let me check the grid. (1,2) is a wall, so no. So if we go right to (0,2), then we can't proceed further. So maybe that's a dead end. So perhaps the path should not take the initial right move.\n\nSo maybe the correct path starts with down.\n\nSo from (0,0) down to (1,0). Now at (1,0). What can we do here?\n\nPossible moves:\n\nUp to (0,0) (back). Down to (2,0) which is 'o'. Right to (1,1) which is a wall. So down to (2,0).\n\nSo moving down to (2,0). Now at (2,0). From here, possible moves:\n\nUp is back. Right to (2,1) which is 'o'. Down is out of bounds.\n\nSo move right to (2,1). Now at (2,1). From here, can move left back, right to (2,2) which is X, the destination. So that's the goal. So the path would be:\n\nStart at (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,1) → right to (2,2). So the moves are down, down, right, right. But let me check again.\n\nWait, first move down from (0,0) to (1,0) (down). Then down again to (2,0). Then right to (2,1) (right). Then right again to (2,2). But (2,1) is o, and moving right from there to (2,2) which is X. So that's valid.\n\nBut the moves would be: down, down, right, right. So the answer would be ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right'].\n\nWait but let me check again. Let me retrace:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nFirst move down → (1,0). Second move down → (2,0). Then from (2,0) move right to (2,1) → move 'right'. Then from (2,1) move right to (2,2) → another 'right'. So the list is ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right'].\n\nBut let me check if there's another path. For example, maybe from (1,0) moving down to (2,0), then right, right. Yes. That's four moves.\n\nAlternatively, what if from (0,0) we first go right then down?\n\nLet me check. From (0,0) → right to (0,1). Then from (0,1), can we go down? (1,1) is a wall, so no. Can we go right to (0,2). Then from (0,2), can we go down? (1,2) is a wall. So no. Then from (0,2) we can't go anywhere except left back. So that's a dead end. So that path doesn't work. Hence, the correct path must be the first option.\n\nAnother possibility: from (1,0) can we move right? (1,1) is a wall. So no. So the only way from (1,0) is down or up. Up would be back. So down to (2,0) is the only forward move.\n\nYes. So the correct path is down, down, right, right. So the answer is that list.\n\nWait, but let me check the grid again. Let me write the positions:\n\nRow 0: [I, o, o]\n\nRow 1: [o, *, *]\n\nRow 2: [o, o, X]\n\nSo (2,0) is o. (2,1) is o. (2,2) is X. So yes, moving right twice from (2,0) gets there.\n\nYes. So the answer is the list of moves: down, down, right, right. So the answer would be Answer: ['down','down','right','right'].\n\nBut let me check if there's another possible path. For example, maybe from (1,0) moving up isn't helpful. What about other possibilities?\n\nAlternatively, from (2,0), could we move up to (1,0), then right? No, because (1,1) is a wall. So no. So the only way is to go right along row 2.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is as above.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this 5x5 maze. Let me first visualize the maze based on the given input.\n\nThe maze is:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o\nRow 1: o * * * *\nRow 2: o o o o o\nRow 3: * * o * *\nRow 4: o o o o X\n\nWait, let me check again. The user provided the maze as:\n\nIoooo\no****\nooooo\n**o**\nooooX\n\nBreaking it down into rows:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o\nRow 1: o * * * * (assuming the second character is o, then four *s? Wait, the input is \"o****\" which is o followed by four *s. So row 1 has 5 characters. Let me confirm each row:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o → positions (0,0) is I, others o.\nRow 1: o * * * * → (1,0) is o, then (1,1) to (1,4) are *.\nRow 2: o o o o o → all o's.\nRow 3: * * o * * → positions (3,0) and (3,1) are *, (3,2) is o, (3,3) and (3,4) are *.\nRow 4: o o o o X → first four o's, then X at (4,4).\n\nSo the start is at (0,0). The exit is at (4,4).\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (4,4), moving up, down, left, right through passable cells (o, I, X). Let me think about possible paths.\n\nLet me sketch the positions:\n\nStart at (0,0). Let's think of possible moves.\n\nFrom (0,0), possible directions: down (to (1,0)), or right (to (0,1)).\n\nBut let's check the maze. Let's look for possible paths.\n\nLooking at row 1: (1,0) is o. So maybe go down first.\n\nFirst approach: maybe try to move down as much as possible where possible.\n\nLet me try to outline possible paths.\n\nOption 1:\n\nStart at (0,0). Let's try moving down to (1,0). That cell is o. Then from (1,0), possible moves. Since row 1 has * from (1,1) onwards. So from (1,0), can we move left? No. Right? The next cell is (1,1) which is a wall. So only options are down or left? Wait, (1,0) is row 1, column 0. Down would take us to (2,0), which is o (row 2, column 0 is o). So from (1,0), move down to (2,0). Then from (2,0), possible directions. Let's see:\n\nRow 2 is all o's. So from (2,0), can move up (back to (1,0)), down to (3,0), left (no, since column 0), or right towards (2,1), etc.\n\nSo maybe go right along row 2. Let's see. From (2,0), moving right to (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Then from there?\n\nBut row 2's (2,4) is o. From there, moving down would take to row 3, column 4 which is a * (since row 3 is **o**). So that's blocked. Alternatively, moving from (2,4) right? No. So perhaps from (2,4), move down to row 3? But row 3 column 4 is *, so can't. So maybe from row 2, column 4, need to move down to row 3 only if possible. Wait, perhaps there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from row 2, column 0, move down to row 3, column 0. But row 3 column 0 is * (as per row 3 is **o** — which is for 5 characters: *, *, o, *, *). So row 3, column 0 is *, so can't go there. So from (2,0), moving down is blocked. So from (2,0), perhaps move right along row 2.\n\nLet me think again. So path so far is:\n\nStart (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0). From here, can't go down. So moving right along row 2. Let's go from (2,0) to (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Then from (2,4), need to get down to row 4. But row 3's columns: row 3 has columns 0-4 as *, *, o, *, *. So row 3, column 4 is *, so can't go down from (2,4) to (3,4). So maybe from (2,4), move right? No. So perhaps from (2,3)? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from row 2, column 2. Because row 3 has an 'o' at column 2. So maybe from (2,2), move down to (3,2). Let me try that.\n\nSo let's track:\n\nFrom (2,0), moving right to (2,1), then (2,2). Then down to (3,2). Now, (3,2) is o. From here, can we move further? Let's see. Row 3: columns 0 and 1 are *, column 2 is o, column 3 is *, column 4 is *. So from (3,2), possible directions: up (back to (2,2)), left? No (because columns 1 and 0 are *). So can move right? Column 3 is *, no. So only up or down? Down would be row 4, column 2. Row 4 is oooooX. So row 4, column 2 is o. So from (3,2), moving down to (4,2). Now at (4,2). From here, need to get to (4,4). Since row 4 is all o's except X at (4,4). So from (4,2), moving right to (4,3), then right to (4,4). That would work.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nStart → down → down → right → right → down → right → right.\n\nBut let's translate each move into directions. Let's track each step.\n\nOriginal position: (0,0).\n\nFirst move: down to (1,0). So direction 'down'.\n\nSecond move: down to (2,0). Direction 'down'.\n\nNow at (2,0). Need to move right to (2,1): direction 'right'.\n\nThen right to (2,2): another 'right'.\n\nNow at (2,2). Move down to (3,2): direction 'down'.\n\nNow at (3,2). Move down to (4,2): direction 'down'.\n\nNow at (4,2). Move right to (4,3): 'right'.\n\nThen right to (4,4): 'right'.\n\nSo the path would be: ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right'].\n\nWait, but let me check the steps again:\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\ndown (step 1) → (1,0)\n\ndown (step 2) → (2,0)\n\nright (step 3) → (2,1)\n\nright (step 4) → (2,2)\n\ndown (step 5) → (3,2)\n\ndown (step 6) → (4,2)\n\nright (step 7) → (4,3)\n\nright (step 8) → (4,4). Yes. That's 8 moves.\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path. Maybe another route?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see if there's a way to go right first from start.\n\nStart at (0,0). Let's try moving right to (0,1). Then from there, maybe move down?\n\nBut row 0 is all o's. Let's see:\n\nFrom (0,0) → right to (0,1). Then perhaps down to (1,1), but (1,1) is * (wall). So that's blocked. So can't go down there. So maybe from (0,1), move right again to (0,2), then down?\n\nRow 1 at column 2 is * (since row 1 is o**** → columns 0 is o, columns 1-4 are *). So from (0,2), moving down to (1,2) would be into a *, which is blocked. So that's not possible. Therefore, moving right along row 0 may not be helpful. Hence, perhaps the initial approach of moving down first is better.\n\nAnother alternative path: From (0,0) down to (1,0), then right? No, because (1,1) is *.\n\nSo the first approach seems viable.\n\nBut let me check if there's another path. For example, maybe from (2,0), moving down to (3,0) is blocked. So no. From (2,0), moving up? That would take back to (1,0). Not helpful.\n\nAnother possibility: From (2,0), move right to (2,1), then up? No, but why would that help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe from (2,0) go right to (2,1), then down? Let's see. (2,1) is o. Down to (3,1), but that's * (row 3, column 1 is *). So blocked. So no.\n\nSo the only way from row 2 is to go to (2,2) and then down.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe from row 2, column 0, go right all the way to (2,4), then from there, move down? But (2,4) is row 2 column 4. From there, moving down to row 3 column 4 is a *, so blocked. So can't. So need to find a way to get down earlier.\n\nSo the original path seems correct.\n\nAnother possible path: Let's see if there's a way through row 3's column 2. For example, maybe from row 2, column 2 down to row 3, then right?\n\nBut how to get to (2,2). From (0,0) down to (1,0), down to (2,0), then right to (2,2). Which is what we had before.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,0) right to (0,1), then down? But (1,1) is *.\n\nNo. So the initial path is the way to go.\n\nAnother check: Let me map the coordinates step by step.\n\nPath steps:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\n1. down → (1,0).\n\n2. down → (2,0).\n\n3. right → (2,1).\n\n4. right → (2,2).\n\n5. down → (3,2).\n\n6. down → (4,2).\n\n7. right → (4,3).\n\n8. right → (4,4). \n\nYes, that's correct. Now, let's check each cell:\n\n(1,0) is o.\n\n(2,0) is o.\n\n(2,1) o.\n\n(2,2) o.\n\n(3,2) o.\n\n(4,2) o.\n\n(4,3) o.\n\n(4,4) X. All passable.\n\nSo the moves are valid. Now, the answer is to output the list of directions.\n\nSo the directions are:\n\ndown, down, right, right, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path. Let me think again. For example, maybe from (2,2) go left or something? Not really. Alternatively, maybe from row 2, column 0, moving right to column 2 in 2 steps, then down. That seems necessary.\n\nIs there another way? Let me think. For example, from row 0, moving right to (0,1), then down to (1,0)? No, because from (0,1), moving down would be to (1,1), which is *.\n\nNo. So no other options.\n\nAnother possible path: Let's see if we can go from (0,0) down to (1,0), then right to (1,0 can't go right). Wait, (1,0) can only go down to (2,0) or left to (0,0). So no other options. So the initial path is the correct one.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the list of moves as described.\n ;Answer: ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right']"

      "Okay, let's try to solve this maze problem. First, I need to understand the maze structure. The user provided a 5x5 grid. Let me write it down to visualize better.\n\nThe maze is:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o\nRow 1: * * o * *\nRow 2: o o o o o\nRow 3: o * * * o\nRow 4: o * o o X\n\nWait, each line is given as a string. Let me index them properly. Let's assume rows are numbered 0 to 4 from top to bottom, and columns 0 to 4 left to right.\n\nStart point 'I' is at position (0,0). The destination 'X' is at (4,4).\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (4,4), moving only through 'o's, and avoiding '*'s. The allowed moves are up, down, left, right. But since we start at (0,0), moving up isn't possible. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, from (0,0). The starting cell. Let's check adjacent cells. To the right is (0,1), which is 'o', so that's passable. Down is (1,0), which is '*', a wall. So first move must be right.\n\nSo first move is 'right'. Now at (0,1). From here, possible moves: can we go right again? (0,2) is 'o'. Or down to (1,1), which is '*'?\n\nSo again, moving right is possible. Let's go right again to (0,2). Then again to (0,3), then (0,4)? But then we reach the right end. From (0,4), can we go down? Let's check. Row 1, column 4 is '*'. So no. So maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from (0,1), instead of moving all the way right, we should move down when possible. Let me backtrack.\n\nStarting again:\n\nStart at (0,0). Move right to (0,1). Now, from (0,1), can we move down? The cell (1,1) is '*', so no. So can't go down. So must move right again. To (0,2). From here, down is (1,2), which is 'o'. So maybe that's a better path.\n\nSo move right again to (0,2), then down to (1,2). Now at (1,2). From here, possible moves: can we go down? Row 2, column 2 is 'o'. So yes. So move down to (2,2). Then perhaps proceed.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,2), can we move right? (1,3) is '*' so no. Left to (1,1) is '*' so no. So only down. So down to (2,2). Now at (2,2). Let's see. The third row is all 'o's. So from (2,2), maybe move left, right, up, or down. Let's think towards the destination.\n\nFrom (2,2), moving towards the X at (4,4). Maybe go down first. Let's try.\n\nFrom (2,2), move down to (3,2). But row 3, column 2 is '*', part of the 'o***o' row. So that's a wall. Can't go there. So that's a problem. So from (2,2), moving down to row 3, column 2 is blocked. So need to move in another direction. Let's see. From (2,2), possible directions: up (back to 1,2?), left to (2,1), right to (2,3), or down to (3,2) which is blocked. So let's try moving right. (2,3) is 'o', then (2,4) is 'o'. So perhaps go right twice to reach (2,4). Then from there, can we move down?\n\nFrom (2,4), moving down to (3,4). Row 3, column 4 is 'o'. Yes. Then down again to (4,4), which is X. Wait, but row 4, column 4 is X. So that would work. Let's check the path:\n\nStart: (0,0) → right to (0,1) → right to (0,2) → down to (1,2) → down to (2,2) → right to (2,3) → right to (2,4) → down to (3,4) → down to (4,4). Let's check if all those cells are passable.\n\n(0,0): I. Then (0,1), (0,2): o. (1,2): o. (2,2): o. Then right to (2,3): o, (2,4): o. Then down to (3,4): o. Then down to (4,4): X. Yes, that works. Let's count the moves:\n\nFrom start:\n\nright, right, down, down, right, right, down, down. So the moves would be:\n\n['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down'].\n\nWait, but maybe there's a shorter path. Let me check again.\n\nAlternative path: Let's see. Maybe from (2,2), instead of going all the way right, maybe go left or something else. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: Let me map out the positions again.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's try to find a path.\n\nAnother possibility: From (0,0) move right to (0,1). Then down to (1,2)? Wait, no. From (0,1), down is (1,1) which is '*'. Can't go there. So maybe from (0,2), down to (1,2). Then from (1,2), maybe move left? No, that would go back. Or right? (1,3) is '*', so no. So only down.\n\nSo (1,2) down to (2,2). Now at (2,2). From here, maybe move left towards (2,1), then (2,0)? Let's see. (2,1) is o. (2,0) is o. Then perhaps down from there?\n\nBut how does that help reach X? Let me try. Suppose from (2,2) move left to (2,1), then left to (2,0). From (2,0), can we move down? (3,0) is o. So down to (3,0). From there, can we move right? But row 3 has walls in columns 1-3. So from (3,0), can move right to (3,1)? No, because (3,1) is '*'. So maybe down again? From (3,0), down to (4,0), which is 'o'. Then from (4,0), need to get to (4,4). But there's a wall at (4,2)? Let me check row 4: o * o o X. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: X. So from (4,0), moving right to (4,1) is blocked. So can't go that way. So this path may not be helpful. So perhaps the initial path is better.\n\nSo back to the first path. Let's check again.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe from (2,2) go right to (2,3), then down? But row 3, column 3 is '*', so can't go down. So from (2,3), can move down? (3,3) is '*', no. So need to go right to (2,4), then down as before.\n\nYes. So that path works.\n\nAnother possible path: From (0,0) → right → down? Wait, no. From (0,0), moving down is to (1,0), which is 'X'? No, row 1 is \"**o**\", so (1,0) is '*', which is a wall. So that's not allowed. So first move must be right.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's try to model this as a graph and perform BFS to find the shortest path. Since I need to find the shortest path, BFS is suitable.\n\nLet me represent the maze as a grid:\n\nRow 0: [I, o, o, o, o]\n\nRow 1: [*, *, o, *, *]\n\nRow 2: [o, o, o, o, o]\n\nRow 3: [o, *, *, *, o]\n\nRow 4: [o, *, o, o, X]\n\nStart at (0,0). End at (4,4).\n\nBFS steps:\n\nInitialize a queue with the starting position. Keep track of visited positions.\n\nEach node will store the current position and the path taken to get there.\n\nStart with (0,0), path = [].\n\nCheck if (0,0) is the destination? No.\n\nDequeue (0,0). Check neighbors:\n\nPossible moves:\n\nRight: (0,1). Valid? Yes, 'o' (or 'I' here). Add to queue with path ['right'].\n\nDown: (1,0) is '*', invalid.\n\nLeft: invalid (off grid).\n\nUp: invalid (off grid).\n\nSo queue now has [(0,1), ...].\n\nNext, dequeue (0,1). Check if it's the destination? No. Check neighbors.\n\nFrom (0,1):\n\nRight to (0,2). Add with path ['right', 'right'].\n\nDown to (1,1) is '*', invalid.\n\nLeft back to (0,0), already visited.\n\nSo queue now has (0,2).\n\nDequeue (0,2). Check neighbors.\n\nRight to (0,3). Add path ['right', 'right', 'right'].\n\nDown to (1,2) which is 'o'. Add path with 'down' move. So path becomes ['right', 'right', 'down'].\n\nContinue this way.\n\nNow, when we reach (1,2), then check its neighbors. From (1,2):\n\nDown to (2,2). Add that with path ... down again. So path becomes previous path plus 'down'.\n\nContinuing BFS:\n\nEventually, when we reach (4,4), we can return the path.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, let's try to track possible paths.\n\nAnother possible path:\n\nFrom (0,0) → right → right → right → right → (0,4). Then down?\n\nFrom (0,4), down to (1,4) which is '*'? No. So stuck. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternative path from (0,2): down to (1,2). Then down to (2,2). From (2,2), move down to (3,2)? But that's a '*' so no. So need to move right. From (2,2) → right → (2,3) → right → (2,4). Then down to (3,4) → down to (4,4). That's the path I thought earlier.\n\nLet me count the steps:\n\nStart → right (step 1: (0,1)), right (step 2: (0,2)), down (step 3: (1,2)), down (step 4: (2,2)), right (step 5: (2,3)), right (step 6: (2,4)), down (step 7: (3,4)), down (step 8: (4,4)). Total 8 moves. The moves are as I listed before.\n\nAnother possible path: Maybe from (2,2) go left to (2,1), then down to (3,1) which is a wall. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,2) go left to (2,1), then left to (2,0). Then down to (3,0). Then right to (3,1)? No, wall. So down to (4,0). Then right to (4,1) is blocked. But (4,0) can go right to (4,2)? How? From (4,0), you can move right to (4,1) which is *, but not allowed. So no. So that path is stuck.\n\nAnother idea: From (2,2), move down to (3,2) is blocked. So no. What about moving up? From (2,2), up to (1,2) which is already visited.\n\nSo the earlier path seems the only way.\n\nAnother possible path: Let's see if there's a way through row 2, moving left and right.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,0) → right → down → ... ?\n\nWait, initial steps:\n\nAfter (0,0) → right → (0,1). Then can't go down. So next right to (0,2). Then down to (1,2). Then down to (2,2). From (2,2), perhaps move left to (2,1), then down to (3,1) which is blocked. Not helpful. Or move right as before.\n\nSo the path seems to be the one I found.\n\nSo the moves would be:\n\n['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']\n\nBut let me check each step's coordinates:\n\nStart (0,0).\n\nAfter right → (0,1).\n\nAfter right → (0,2).\n\nAfter down → (1,2).\n\nAfter down → (2,2).\n\nAfter right → (2,3).\n\nAfter right → (2,4).\n\nAfter down → (3,4).\n\nAfter down → (4,4). Correct.\n\nYes, that's valid. Let me check each cell:\n\n(0,0): I.\n\n(0,1): o.\n\n(0,2): o.\n\n(1,2): o (row 1, column 2).\n\n(2,2): o.\n\n(2,3): o.\n\n(2,4): o.\n\n(3,4): o (row 3, column 4).\n\n(4,4): X. All valid.\n\nAnother possible shorter path? Let's think. Maybe from (2,4), can we go left to (2,3), then down to (3,3) which is a wall. No. Or from (3,4), can we move left? (3,3) is a wall. So no. So that path is the shortest.\n\nIs there another way? Let's think of other routes. For example, from (2,2), maybe go up to (1,2), then left? No. Or from (1,2), can we go left? (1,1) is *, no. So no.\n\nAnother possibility: Let's see if there's a way from row 0 to row 2 earlier. For example, from (0,0) → right → down? No, because (1,0) is blocked. What about from (0,2) down to (1,2), then maybe go left to (1,1) is blocked. No.\n\nAnother path idea: From (2,2), go right to (2,3), then down to (3,3) is blocked. No. So no.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,4) down to (3,4) as before.\n\nSo seems like that's the only path.\n\nSo the answer should be the list of moves as described. Let me write them again:\n\nright, right, down, down, right, right, down, down. So the list is ['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down'].\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way with fewer steps. Let me check. Let's count steps. Each move is one step. The total number of steps here is 8. Since it's a 5x5 grid, the minimal steps would be from (0,0) to (4,4): Manhattan distance is 8 (since you need to move 4 down and 4 right, but depending on obstacles). However, in this case, due to obstacles, maybe that's not possible. Let me check if there's a shorter path.\n\nIs there a path that requires fewer steps?\n\nFor example, let's imagine: Can we go from (0,0) → right → right → down → right → down → ... ?\n\nLet me try:\n\n(0,0) → right → (0,1)\n\n→ right → (0,2)\n\n→ down → (1,2)\n\n→ right → (1,3) which is *, blocked. No.\n\nAlternative from (1,2) → down to (2,2).\n\nThen from (2,2) → right → (2,3) → right → (2,4) → down → (3,4) → down → (4,4). Same as before.\n\nSame number of steps.\n\nAnother idea: From (0,0) → right → (0,1) → down → (1,2)? Wait, how? From (0,1), down is row 1, column 1, which is *.\n\nNo. Can't go there.\n\nAnother possible route: Maybe from row 0, go right to (0,3), then down to row 2, column 3?\n\nYes. Let me try:\n\n(0,0) → right → (0,1) → right → (0,2) → right → (0,3). Then down? From (0,3), down to (1,3) is *, so blocked. Can't go there. So no.\n\nSo that's not helpful.\n\nAnother possibility: From (0,3), move down to (1,3) is blocked, but maybe move down to row 2, column 3? No. So no.\n\nHmm. So I think the path I found is the correct one. Let me confirm once again.\n\nYes, I think that's the only possible path. Therefore, the answer should be the list of those moves.\n ;Answer: ['right','right','down','down','right','right','down','down']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this 5x5 maze. The maze is given as:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o\nRow 1: o * * * o\nRow 2: o o o * o\nRow 3: o * o * *\nRow 4: o * o o X\n\nFirst, I should figure out where the start and end points are. The 'I' is at the first row, first column (assuming rows are 0-indexed). Let me map the coordinates. Let's consider (row, column) as positions.\n\nStart is at (0,0). The end 'X' is at (4,4).\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (4,4), moving only through 'o's and avoiding '*'s. The allowed moves are up, down, left, right. But since we start at (0,0), moving up isn't possible (since row is 0). So initial moves could be right or down.\n\nLet me try to visualize the maze step by step.\n\nRow 0: Positions (0,0) is I, then (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) are all o. So from start, moving right along row 0 is possible until column 4. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nLooking at row 1: first cell is o (position (1,0)), but then three *s. So (1,0) is accessible. But positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are walls. Only (1,4) is o.\n\nRow 2: (2,0) o, (2,1) o, (2,2) o, (2,3) *, (2,4) o.\n\nRow 3: (3,0) o, (3,1) *, (3,2) o, (3,3) *, (3,4) *.\n\nRow 4: (4,0) o, (4,1) *, (4,2) o, (4,3) o, (4,4) X.\n\nSo possible paths. Let me think of possible routes.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's consider possible directions.\n\nOption 1: Move down to (1,0). From there, can I go further? Let's see. From (1,0), possible moves: up (back to start), down to (2,0), or right? But column 0, row 1. Let's try down to (2,0). Then from (2,0), can move up, down, right. Let's go right. Maybe moving right along row 2.\n\nAnother option is to move right from the start. Let's see. Starting at (0,0), moving right to (0,1), then maybe further right. But row 0, column 1 is o. Let's see if that's a viable path.\n\nBut maybe I need to use BFS or DFS approach here. Since I need to find a path, perhaps I can simulate the steps.\n\nLet me try to outline possible paths.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's try moving down first. So first move is down to (1,0). Then down again to (2,0). From there, moving right. Let's see:\n\n(2,0) can go right to (2,1), then right to (2,2). Then from (2,2), can I go down? Row 3, column 2 is o. So down to (3,2). From there, can move right? But (3,3) is *, so no. Can move up (back to 2,2) or left? Or down to row 4, column 2. So down to (4,2). From there, (4,2) is o. Now, need to get to (4,4). From (4,2), can move right to (4,3), then right to (4,4). That's possible. Let's check if those positions are passable. (4,3) is o, and (4,4) is X. So yes. So the path would be:\n\nStart (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,1) → right to (2,2) → down to (3,2) → down to (4,2) → right to (4,3) → right to (4,4). Now, translating these moves into directions:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): down.\n\nFrom (1,0) to (2,0): down.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (2,1): right.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (2,2): right.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (3,2): down.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (4,2): down.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (4,3): right.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,4): right.\n\nSo the moves would be: down, down, right, right, down, down, right, right. Let me check if there's any walls in between. For example, when moving from (3,2) to (4,2), that's allowed. And (4,2) is o. Then moving right twice. Yes.\n\nAnother possible path: from start, move right to (0,1), then down to row 1, but row 1 has walls. Let me see. Starting at (0,0) → right to (0,1). From there, can move down to (1,1) but that's a wall (*). So that's not possible. So maybe that path isn't viable. So perhaps the first path is valid.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,0) move right to (0,1), then right again to (0,2), then down to row 1, column 2? But row 1, column 2 is * (since row 1 has * from columns 1-3). So that's blocked. So moving down from (0,2) would take you to (1,2), which is a wall. So that's not allowed. Therefore, that path is blocked.\n\nAnother approach: from (0,0) move down to (1,0), then right? No, because (1,0) is column 0, row 1. Moving right would take you to (1,1), which is a wall. So that's not possible. So after moving down to (1,0), the next move must be down again to (2,0).\n\nSo the first path seems valid. Let me check if there's another path.\n\nAnother possibility: from (0,0) down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → down to (3,0). (3,0) is o. From (3,0), can move up (back), down to (4,0) (o), or right. From (4,0), moving right is blocked at (4,1) which is *. So perhaps from (3,0), moving right? Let's see. (3,0) can move right to (3,1) which is *, no. So maybe down to (4,0), then up again? Not helpful. So perhaps not useful. So that path might not help. So back to the first path.\n\nAnother possibility: from (0,0) go all the way right to (0,4). Let's see. Then from there, can we move down? (0,4) is row 0, column 4. Down to (1,4) which is o. Then down to (2,4) which is o. From (2,4), can move down to (3,4) which is * (row 3, column 4). No. So can't go there. Or left. From (2,4), moving left to (2,3) which is *? Yes, row 2, column 3 is *, so blocked. So from (2,4), possible moves: up, down (to (1,4) or (3,4) but (3,4) is blocked?), left? No. So from (2,4), can go up to (1,4), then maybe down again? Not helpful. Alternatively, from (2,4), move left to column 4-1=3? No, that's blocked. So perhaps from (0,4), moving down to (1,4), then down to (2,4). Then how to proceed? From (2,4), maybe move left down to (2,2)? But need to find a way. Let me think. From (2,4), moving left to (2,3) is blocked. So maybe go down to row 3, column 4? But row 3, column 4 is *? Let me check the maze again. Row 3 is o * o * *, so columns 0 to 4: o (0), * (1), o (2), * (3), * (4). Yes. So (3,4) is blocked. So from (2,4), down is blocked. So perhaps from (2,4), move up to (1,4). From (1,4), can we move left? Let's see. (1,4) is column 4, row 1. Moving left would go through (1,3) which is *, then (1,2), also *, then (1,1) also *. So no. So that path seems stuck. Therefore, going all the way right might not be helpful. So the first path seems better.\n\nLet me check another path. Starting at (0,0). Down to (1,0). Then down to (2,0). Right to (2,1), right to (2,2). From here, down to (3,2). From (3,2), can we go right? (3,3) is *, no. Down to (4,2). Then right twice. That's the path I thought earlier. So that's valid.\n\nSo the moves are down, down, right, right, down, down, right, right. So the list would be ['down','down','right','right','down','down','right','right'].\n\nWait, but let me count the steps. Let me track each move:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\n1. down → (1,0)\n2. down → (2,0)\n3. right → (2,1)\n4. right → (2,2)\n5. down → (3,2)\n6. down → (4,2)\n7. right → (4,3)\n8. right → (4,4)\n\nYes, 8 moves. So the answer would be a list of those 8 directions.\n\nBut let me check if there's another possible path. For example, maybe going up? Well, starting at (0,0), can't go up. So no.\n\nAnother possibility: from (0,0) down to (1,0), right is blocked. So no. So that path is not possible.\n\nAnother possible route: from (2,0), moving down to (3,0), then right to (3,2)? Let's see. From (3,0), moving right to (3,1) is blocked. So no. How about from (3,0) down to (4,0), then right to (4,1) is blocked. But (4,0) can go right to (4,2) if possible. Wait, from (4,0), moving right to (4,1) is *, blocked. So can't. So how to get to (4,2) from there? Maybe from (3,0), move up back to (2,0), then proceed as before.\n\nAlternatively, is there another way? Let me think. From (2,2), maybe go up to row 1, column 2? But row 1, column 2 is *? Yes, row 1 has columns 1-3 as *s. So that's blocked. So no.\n\nAnother thought: from (0,0) down to (1,0), then down to (2,0), then up again? No, that's backtracking. Not helpful.\n\nSo the initial path seems valid.\n\nLet me also check if there are other paths. For example, starting at (0,0) move right to (0,1), then down to (1,1) but that's a wall. No. So invalid.\n\nAnother idea: from (0,0) down to (1,0), then right? No. So the only viable path seems the first one.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that each step is valid. Let me retrace:\n\n(0,0) down to (1,0): valid.\n\n(1,0) down to (2,0): valid.\n\n(2,0) right to (2,1): valid.\n\n(2,1) right to (2,2): valid.\n\n(2,2) down to (3,2): valid (since row 3, column 2 is o).\n\n(3,2) down to (4,2): valid (row 4, column 2 is o).\n\n(4,2) right to (4,3): valid (o).\n\n(4,3) right to (4,4): valid (X).\n\nYes, all steps are allowed.\n\nSo the answer is the list of those moves. So the answer is ['down','down','right','right','down','down','right','right'].\n\nWait, but maybe there's a shorter path. Let me check.\n\nIs there a way to reach the destination in fewer steps?\n\nFor example, from (0,0) go right to (0,4), then down. But earlier analysis shows that path hits a dead end. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another route. Let's see:\n\nStart → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → down to (3,0) → right to (3,2)? But how? From (3,0), moving right to (3,1) is blocked. Can't go directly. So no. Alternatively, from (3,0), up to (2,0), then right to (2,2), then down. Which is the original path.\n\nAnother possibility: from (2,0) go right to (2,2), then down to (3,2), then right to (3,3) is blocked. No. So original path is still the way.\n\nAnother thought: from (4,2), can we go up? For example, if there's a way to reach (4,2) via another path. But our original path already reaches there.\n\nSo the original path seems to be the correct one. Therefore, the answer should be that list of moves.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','right','right','down','down','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this 3x3 maze. Let me first visualize the maze.\n\nThe maze is given as:\nRow 0: I o o\nRow 1: o * o\nRow 2: o o X\n\nSo, the starting point 'I' is at position (0,0). The destination 'X' is at (2,2). Let me note down the positions.\n\nFirst, let me figure out the coordinates. Assuming rows are y-axis and columns x-axis. Or maybe the other way around? Well, typically in grids, it's (row, column), but when moving up/down, it's changing the row. Let me think. Let's say each cell is (row, column). So, moving up would decrease the row by 1, moving down increases it. Left decreases column, right increases.\n\nSo the start is at (0,0). The X is at (2,2). Let me check the maze again:\n\nRow 0: I (0,0), o (0,1), o (0,2)\nRow 1: o (1,0), * (1,1), o (1,2)\nRow 2: o (2,0), o (2,1), X (2,2)\n\nSo, the walls are at (1,1). Let me try to find a path. Let's think possible steps.\n\nFrom start (0,0), possible moves: right to (0,1) or down to (1,0). Let's explore both options.\n\nFirst, trying right. From (0,0) to (0,1). Then, from there, possible moves: right again to (0,2), left back, down to (1,1) which is a wall. So right to (0,2). Now at (0,2). From there, can we move down? Let's see. (0,2) down is row 1, column 2. That's o, so allowed. So move down to (1,2). Then from there, possible moves: down again to (2,2) which is X. So that's the destination. Wait! So path would be: right, down, down. But wait, let me check.\n\nStarting at (0,0) → right to (0,1) → right to (0,2) → down to (1,2) → down to (2,2). But (1,2) down is allowed. Yes. Then (2,2) is the destination. So that's a valid path. The moves would be: right, right, down, down. But let me check if that's possible.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any walls in between. From (0,2) down to (1,2) is allowed. (1,2) is o. Then down again to (2,2). So yes. That works. So the path would be right, right, down, down. But let me check another possible path via the other initial move.\n\nAlternatively, starting with down. From (0,0) down to (1,0). Then from (1,0), possible moves. Can't move right to (1,1) because it's a wall. So possible moves: down to (2,0), or left isn't possible (since column 0). So move down to (2,0). From (2,0), can move right to (2,1), which is o. Then right again to (2,2), which is X. So that path would be down, down, right, right. That's another valid path.\n\nSo there are two possible paths here. The problem says to output a list of moves. Either path is acceptable. Let me check if both are valid.\n\nThe problem didn't specify to find the shortest path, but usually, such problems expect the shortest. Both paths have 4 moves. So either is acceptable.\n\nBut let me check if there are other possible paths. For example, maybe combining the two routes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from (0,0) right to (0,1), then down to (1,1)... but that's a wall. So no. So that's blocked.\n\nAnother possibility: from (0,0) down to (1,0), then right? No, because (1,0) can't go right to (1,1) as it's a wall. So the two paths I found are the main options.\n\nSo the answer can be either ['right', 'right', 'down', 'down'] or ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right'].\n\nBut let me check again the maze to make sure. For example, the first path:\n\nStart (0,0) → right (0,1) → right (0,2) → down (1,2) → down (2,2). Correct.\n\nSecond path: (0,0) down (1,0) → down (2,0) → right (2,1) → right (2,2). Correct.\n\nSo both paths are valid. The problem didn't specify which one to choose, so I can choose either. Let's pick one. For example, the first one. So the answer would be ['right', 'right', 'down', 'down'].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the first possible path found by a certain algorithm. For example, if using BFS, both are possible depending on the order of exploration.\n\nSo I need to output one of them. Let me confirm once again. Let me check if there are any other obstacles. For example, in the first path, moving from (1,2) to (2,2) is allowed. Yes.\n\nYes. So the answer is either of the two. Let me choose the first one.

Since it's a maze, maybe BFS is the way to go, but since I need to output the directions as a list of moves, perhaps I can simulate the path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to trace the path manually. Let's try that.\n\nStarting at (0,0). From there, possible moves are right or down. Let's check the first row. The first row is all o's except the start. So maybe moving right is possible. But maybe there's a better way. Let me see.\n\nBut looking at the second row (row 1): o***o******. So columns 1, 2, 3 are walls. So if I go down from (0,0) to (1,0), which is allowed. Because row 1, column 0 is 'o'? Let me check the input again. The first row is \"Ioooooooooo\" which is row 0. Then row 1 is \"o***o******\". The first character of row 1 is 'o', so (1,0) is passable. So maybe moving down first.\n\nSo starting at (0,0). Let's try to move down to (1,0). Then, from (1,0), possible moves. Let's see. Can't move left (out of bounds). Can move down again to (2,0). Let's check row 2: \"ooo*ooooooo\". The first character is 'o', so (2,0) is okay. So down again. Then row 3: \"o*o*o*o****\". First column is 'o', so (3,0) is okay. Continue down until I hit a wall?\n\nRow 4: same pattern? Let me check. Row 4 is \"o*o*o*ooooo\". First column is 'o', so (4,0) is okay. Row 5: \"o*o*o*o*o*o\" — first column is 'o', so (5,0) is okay. Then row 6: same. Row 7: \"o*o*****o*o\" — first column is 'o', so (7,0) is okay. Row 8: \"o*ooooo*o*o\" — first column 'o'. Row 9: \"o*o***o****\" — first column 'o'. Row 10: \"o*ooo*ooooX\" — first column 'o'. So if I keep moving down from the starting point, I can go all the way down to (10, 0). But then how to get to X at (10,10)? That would require moving right through row 10. But row 10 is \"o*ooo*ooooX\". Let me parse that:\n\nBreaking down row 10 (index 10):\n\nPositions 0 to 10:\n\n0: o\n1: *\n2: o\n3: o\n4: o\n5: *\n6: o\n7: o\n8: o\n9: o\n10: X\n\nSo from (10,0), I can move right to column 2, but there's a wall at column 1. But to reach X at (10,10), there's a wall at position 5 (column 5). So from (10,4), maybe? Let's see. But row 10's path is blocked at column 5. So moving all the way down to (10,0) might not be the best approach. Maybe I need to move right earlier.\n\nAlternative approach: From the start, maybe move right first. Let's see. Starting at (0,0). Moving right to (0,1). Then maybe continue right. But need to check for walls. Let's check row 0: all o's except the first is I. So row 0 is all passable. But maybe moving right is possible. However, looking at row 1, column 1 is '*', so if I go down from (0,1) to (1,1), that's a wall. So perhaps moving down first is better.\n\nSo back to the initial idea: moving down from (0,0) to (1,0). Then again down to (2,0), etc. Let's try to plan a path.\n\nOnce at (10,0), need to move right. Let's see how far we can go. From (10,0), right to (10,1) is blocked (it's *). So that's no good. So maybe moving down to row 10 isn't helpful. So perhaps I need to move right earlier.\n\nLet me think again. Starting at (0,0). Maybe go right to (0,1), then down when possible.\n\nLooking for a path. Let me try to sketch mentally.\n\nRow 0: all o's. So maybe go right as far as possible? But perhaps there's a need to go down earlier. Let me check the maze again.\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o o o o.\n\nRow 1: o * * * o * * * * * * ?\n\nWait, the second row is \"o***o******\". Let me count the characters. Each row is 11 characters.\n\nRow 1: o * * * o * * * * * * ?\n\nYes. So columns 0 is o, then columns 1-3 are *, then column 4 is o, then columns 5-10 are *.\n\nSo if I'm at (0,0), moving down to (1,0) is okay. Then from (1,0), moving right to (1,4) is blocked by walls. So from (1,0), can I move down again to (2,0)?\n\nRow 2: \"ooo*ooooooo\". Let's parse it. Columns 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, then columns 4-10 are o's?\n\nYes. So (2,0) is o. So from (1,0), down to (2,0). Then in row 2, maybe move right?\n\nAt (2,0), moving right to (2,1) is allowed. Let's try that. Then (2,1), then again right to (2,2), allowed. Then (2,3) is *, blocked. So need to stop at (2,2). Then perhaps down?\n\nRow 3: \"o*o*o*o****\". Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, then columns 7-10 are *.\n\nSo from (2,2), moving down to (3,2) is allowed. Then in row 3, column 2. From there, can move right to (3,2) and check. Let's say I'm at (3,2). Can move right to column 4? Because row 3's column 3 is *, so can't go there. So from (3,2), right is blocked at column 3. So perhaps move down again.\n\nRow 4: \"o*o*o*ooooo\". Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o.\n\nSo from (3,2) down to (4,2) is allowed. Now in row 4, column 2. From here, maybe move right to (4,4)? Let's see. The path would be (4,2) → right to (4,3) is blocked (since row 4 has * at column 3?), no. Wait row 4 is \"o*o*o*ooooo\". Let me parse the columns:\n\nRow 4, columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o. So columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 are o. So from (4,2), moving right to (4,4) would require passing through column 3 which is *, so no. So need to move down again?\n\nRow 5: \"o*o*o*o*o*o\". Same pattern: o at even columns. So from (4,2) down to (5,2). Then, perhaps move down again?\n\nBut maybe there's a better path. Alternatively, from (4,2), move down to row 5, column 2, then move right when possible. Let's see. In row 5, column 2 is o. Then, since column 3 is *, can't move right. So maybe down again to row 6, column 2. Row 6 is same as row 5. So this could continue until row 7.\n\nRow 7: \"o*o*****o*o\". Let's parse columns. 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, then columns 3-6 are *, column 7 is o, column 8: *, column 9: o, column 10: *? Wait the row is \"o*o*****o*o\". Let me count:\n\no * o * * * * o * o o ?\n\nWait, original input for row 7 is \"o*o*****o*o\". Let me count 11 characters:\n\n1. o\n2. *\n3. o\n4. *\n5. *\n6. *\n7. *\n8. o\n9. *\n10. o\n11. o ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me write it out:\n\no * o * * * * o * o o ?\n\nWait, perhaps the exact positions. Let's think. For row 7:\n\ncolumns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: *, 7: o, 8: *, 9: o, 10: o ?\n\nSo from column 2 (position 2) in row 7, can I move right? At row 7, column 2 is o. Then, column 3 is *, so can't move right. So maybe down again? But row 7 is the 7th row. Let's check row 8.\n\nRow 8: \"o*ooooo*o*o\". Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o.\n\nSo if I'm at row 7, column 2, moving down to row 8, column 2 (o). From there, can move right. For example, (8,2) can move to (8,3), (8,4), etc. That seems promising. So perhaps this is a way to get to the right side.\n\nSo let me retrace. Starting from (0,0), down to (1,0), down to (2,0). Then right to (2,2). Down to (3,2). Down to (4,2). Down to (5,2). Down to (6,2). Down to (7,2). Then down to (8,2). Now at (8,2). Now, can move right. Let's see. From (8,2), moving right to column 3, 4, 5, 6. Because row 8's columns 2-6 are o's (columns 2 is o, 3 is o, 4 o, 5 o, 6 o, then column 7 is *). So from (8,2), moving right to (8,6). Then perhaps down?\n\nRow 9: \"o*o***o****\". Let me parse. Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, o at column 6? Or maybe let me check again. Original row 9 is \"o*o***o****\". So:\n\ncolumns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, then columns 7-10 are *.\n\nSo if I'm at (8,6), which is row 8, column 6. Moving down to row 9, column 6 is o. From there, can I move right? Row 9, column 6 is o. The next columns are *, so can't move right. So maybe from (9,6), move down to row 10, column 6. Row 10's column 6 is o. Then from (10,6), need to move right towards X.\n\nRow 10 is \"o*ooo*ooooX\". Let's check columns:\n\nAt (10,6), which is column 6. The X is at column 10. Let me check row 10's columns:\n\ncolumns 0: o\n1: *\n2: o\n3: o\n4: o\n5: *\n6: o\n7: o\n8: o\n9: o\n10: X\n\nSo from (10,6), moving right through columns 7, 8, 9, 10. So that's possible. So the path would be from (10,6) → right 4 times to reach X. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nStart at (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,1) → right to (2,2) → down to (3,2) → down to (4,2) → down to (5,2) → down to (6,2) → down to (7,2) → down to (8,2) → right to (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6) → down to (9,6) → down to (10,6) → right to (10,7), (10,8), (10,9), (10,10).\n\nNow, converting these movements into directions. Let's track each step.\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\n1. Down to (1,0) → 'down'\n2. Down to (2,0) → 'down'\n3. Right to (2,1) → 'right'\n4. Right to (2,2) → 'right'\n5. Down to (3,2) → 'down'\n6. Down to (4,2) → 'down'\n7. Down to (5,2) → 'down'\n8. Down to (6,2) → 'down'\n9. Down to (7,2) → 'down'\n10. Down to (8,2) → 'down'\n11. Right to (8,3) → 'right'\n12. Right to (8,4) → 'right'\n13. Right to (8,5) → 'right'\n14. Right to (8,6) → 'right'\n15. Down to (9,6) → 'down'\n16. Down to (10,6) → 'down'\n17. Right to (10,7) → 'right'\n18. Right to (10,8) → 'right'\n19. Right to (10,9) → 'right'\n20. Right to (10,10) → 'right'\n\nSo the total moves are: down, down, right, right, down, down, down, down, down, down, right, right, right, right, down, down, right, right, right, right. \n\nBut let me check if there are any obstacles in between. For example, when moving from (8,2) to (8,6), are there any walls? Row 8 is \"o*ooooo*o*o\". Let me check columns 2-6. The row is o*ooooo*o*o. Let me parse row 8:\n\nAssuming row 8 is index 8. The string is \"o*ooooo*o*o\". Let's break down each column:\n\n0: o\n1: *\n2: o\n3: o\n4: o\n5: o\n6: o\n7: *\n8: o\n9: *\n10: o\n\nYes. So columns 2-6 are all o. So moving right from 2 to 6 is okay. \n\nAnother check: when moving down from row 7 to 8. Row 7, column 2 is o (from earlier analysis). Row 8, column 2 is o. So that's allowed.\n\nAnother check: row 9, column 6 is o. Row 9's string is \"o*o***o****\". Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o. Yes. So moving down from (8,6) to (9,6) is allowed. Then down to (10,6) which is o. \n\nSo that path is valid.\n\nNow, converting the moves into the list of directions. The moves are as follows:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nWait, that's 20 moves. Let me count again. Let's list each step:\n\nFrom start:\n\nStep 1: down (from 0,0 to 1,0)\nStep 2: down (to 2,0)\nStep 3: right (to 2,1)\nStep 4: right (to 2,2)\nStep 5: down (to 3,2)\nStep 6: down (to 4,2)\nStep 7: down (to 5,2)\nStep 8: down (to 6,2)\nStep 9: down (to 7,2)\nStep 10: down (to 8,2)\nStep 11: right (to 8,3)\nStep 12: right (to 8,4)\nStep 13: right (to 8,5)\nStep 14: right (to 8,6)\nStep 15: down (to 9,6)\nStep 16: down (to 10,6)\nStep 17: right (to 10,7)\nStep 18: right (to 10,8)\nStep 19: right (to 10,9)\nStep 20: right (to 10,10)\n\nYes, 20 steps. So the answer would be that list. \n\nBut maybe there's a shorter path. Let me think if there's an alternative. For example, maybe there's a way to move more to the right earlier and avoid some down moves. Let me see.\n\nAlternative path: Starting at (0,0), move right to (0,1), then down, etc. Let me try.\n\nFrom (0,0) → right to (0,1). Then down to (1,1) is blocked (since row 1, column 1 is *). So that's no good. So perhaps not. \n\nAnother alternative: From (0,0) move right to (0,4) somehow? But how? Because row 1 blocks that. For example, to get to row 1, column 4, which is o (as per row 1: o***o******). So row 1, column 4 is o. But to get there from row 0, you need to move down from row 0, column 4. But how to get there? \n\nSo maybe:\n\n(0,0) → right to (0,1), (0,2), ..., (0,4). Then down to (1,4). Then proceed. But let's see if that's possible. \n\nRow 0 allows moving right all the way. So from (0,0) moving right 4 times to (0,4). Then down to (1,4). Then from there, maybe proceed. Let me check.\n\nFrom (1,4), can we move down to row 2, column 4? Row 2's column 4 is o (row 2 is \"ooo*ooooooo\", so columns 4 is o). So yes. Then from (2,4), can move left? Or right? Let's see. Maybe this path could be shorter. Let's try.\n\nSo path:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nMove right 4 times to (0,4).\n\nDown to (1,4).\n\nDown to (2,4).\n\nNow, row 2, column 4 is o. From here, perhaps move right? Let's check row 2. From column 4 onwards, it's ooooo (columns 4-10 are o's). So moving right to (2,10) would be possible? Let me see. From (2,4) moving right to (2,10). Then down to row 3, but row 3 has walls. However, perhaps from (2,4) moving down to row 3, column 4. Row 3's column 4 is o. \n\nSo let's try:\n\n(2,4) → down to (3,4). Then down to (4,4). Then down to (5,4). Then down to (6,4). Then down to (7,4). Now, row 7, column 4 is *? Let me check row 7: \"o*o*****o*o\". Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: *, 7: o, etc. So row 7, column 4 is * (wall). So can't go there. So from (6,4), moving down to (7,4) is blocked. So need to find another way.\n\nSo from (6,4), maybe move right? Let's see. Row 6 is \"o*o*o*o*o*o\". Column 4 is o. So from (6,4), can move right? Column 5 is *, so no. So perhaps move left? Not helpful. Or move up? Not helpful. Hmm. So maybe this path hits a dead end. \n\nTherefore, maybe the initial path is better.\n\nSo going back to the first path. Let me check again. The first path seems valid. So the answer would be the list of moves as described.\n\nAnother check: Let me count how many downs and rights. \n\nFrom (0,0) down twice to (2,0). Then right twice to (2,2). Then down 6 times to (8,2). Then right four times to (8,6). Then down twice to (10,6). Then right four times. \n\nYes. So the directions are as before. \n\nNow, converting this into the required list format. The answer is:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nBut let me check the count again. The down steps between (0,0) to (2,0) are two downs. Then from (2,2) down to (3,2) is one, then down to 4, 5, 6, 7, 8: that's 5 more downs (steps 5-9: 5 steps?), let me recount:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nAfter step 2 (down to 2,0), steps 3 and 4 are rights. Then step 5: down to 3,2 (1 down). Step 6: down to 4,2 (another down). Step 7: down to 5,2. Step 8: 6,2. Step 9: 7,2. Step 10: 8,2. So that's 5 downs (steps 5-10: 6 steps? Let me count:\n\nFrom step 5 to step 10, that's 6 steps (steps 5,6,7,8,9,10). Let me check:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nStep 1: down\n\nStep 2: down\n\nStep 3: right\n\nStep 4: right\n\nStep 5: down\n\nStep 6: down\n\nStep 7: down\n\nStep 8: down\n\nStep 9: down\n\nStep 10: down \n\nWait from (2,2) to (3,2) is step 5. Then from there down 5 more times to reach (8,2)? Let's see:\n\n(2,2) → step5 down → (3,2)\n\nstep6 → (4,2)\n\nstep7 → (5,2)\n\nstep8 → (6,2)\n\nstep9 → (7,2)\n\nstep10 → (8,2)\n\nYes, that's 5 steps (steps 5-10, 6 steps? No, steps 5 through 10 are 6 steps? Let me count:\n\nSteps 5: 1\n\nSteps 6: 2\n\nSteps 7: 3\n\nSteps 8: 4\n\nSteps 9: 5\n\nSteps 10: 6. Oh right, steps 5 to 10 is 6 'down's. Wait initial steps 1 and 2 are two downs. Then from step 5 to 10, six downs. So total of 8 downs? Let me recount the entire list:\n\nOriginal list of directions:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', ...]\n\nYes, steps 1 and 2 are two downs. Then steps 5-10 are six downs. Then steps 15 and 16 are two downs. Let me count all the moves again:\n\nTotal moves:\n\n1. down\n\n2. down\n\n3. right\n\n4. right\n\n5. down\n\n6. down\n\n7. down\n\n8. down\n\n9. down\n\n10. down\n\n11. right\n\n12. right\n\n13. right\n\n14. right\n\n15. down\n\n16. down\n\n17. right\n\n18. right\n\n19. right\n\n20. right\n\nYes. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is the list as above.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right','down','down','right','right','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start 'I' to the destination 'X' in this 8x8 maze. The available moves are up, down, left, right. Let me first visualize the maze.\n\nThe maze is given as 8 lines, each with 8 characters. Let me write them down:\n\nRow 0: I o o * o o o o\nRow 1: o * * * o * * * o\nRow 2: o o o o o o o * o? Wait, wait, each row should be 8 characters. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nIoo*ooooo\no***o***o\nooooooo*o\no*o******\no*ooooooo\n****o***o\nooooooo*o\n******o**\nooooooooX\n\nWait, let me count each line's characters. For example, the first line is \"Ioo*ooooo\"—let's count:\n\nI, o, o, *, o, o, o, o → 8 characters. Correct.\n\nSecond line: o***o***o → o, *, *, *, o, *, *, * → Wait, that's o followed by three *, then o, then three * and o? Let me count: o * * * o * * * o? That's 9 characters. Wait, but the user said it's n x n. The example given is 8 lines, so n is 8? Wait, the input is 8 lines, each line should have 8 characters. Let me check each line:\n\nFirst line: Ioo*ooooo → I o o * o o o o → 8. Correct.\n\nSecond line: o***o***o → Let me count: o * * * o * * * o? That's 9. Wait, maybe a typo. Let me check again. Maybe the user made a mistake? Or perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me count:\n\nOriginal second line: o***o***o. Let's break it down:\n\no * * * o * * * o? That's 9 characters. But if n is 8, each line must be 8. Hmm. Maybe there's a typo. Let me check again. Wait, maybe the second line is o***o***o. Let me count:\n\no (1), *, *, *, o (4), *, *, *, o (7+1?), no. Wait, maybe it's o***o***? Which would be 8. Or maybe o***o***o is a typo and should have 8 characters. This is confusing. Maybe I need to assume that each line is 8 characters. Let me check each line's length based on the given input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the input. But since I have to work with what's given, perhaps I should parse each line as 8 characters. Let me try to re-express each line properly.\n\nLet me list each line again:\n\nLine 1: Ioo*ooooo → 8.\n\nLine 2: o***o***o → Let's count: o (1), *, *, *, o (4), *, *, *, o (9). That's 9 characters. Hmm. But maybe the user intended it as 8. Maybe the line is o***o*** (without the last o?), but that's not what's written. Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo and it's supposed to be o***o****? Not sure. This might be a problem. But given that the user provided the maze as such, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that each line is 8 characters. Let me check again. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me take the second line: o***o***o. Let me count each character:\n\n1. o\n2. *\n3. *\n4. *\n5. o\n6. *\n7. *\n8. *\nThat would be 8 characters, but the line ends with an 'o'? Wait, no. If it's written as o***o***o, then between the o's there are three *s, then an o, then three *s and another o. That would be o * * * o * * * o → 9. So there's a problem here. Maybe the user made a typo, but since I need to proceed, perhaps I should check for each line. Alternatively, perhaps the maze is 9x9? But the start and end are in the first and last lines. Let me check the last line: ooooooooX → 8 o's and X → 9 characters. But if it's n x n, then if the last line is 9 characters, then n is 9. But the first line is 8. So there's inconsistency here. This is a problem. But since I need to proceed, perhaps I should assume that each line is 8 characters. Maybe there's a typo in the input. Alternatively, perhaps I should take the input as given and try to parse it. Maybe the user intended for each line to have 8 characters, and there's a typo in some lines. For example, the second line may have been intended as o***o**** (with four * at the end?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the lines are 9 characters, making it a 9x9 maze. Let me check the last line again: ooooooooX → 9 characters. So if that's the case, then the maze is 9x9. Let me check the first line again: Ioo*ooooo → I o o * o o o o → 8 characters. So that's 8. So there's inconsistency. This is a problem. Maybe the user made a mistake. However, given that the start is in the first line and the end is in the last line, perhaps the maze is 9x9. Let me try to count again for each line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended each line to be 8 characters. Let me check again:\n\nFirst line: Ioo*ooooo → I o o * o o o o → 8.\n\nSecond line: o***o***o → Let me count each character. Let's write it out:\n\no * * * o * * * o → 9. So that's 9. So if the user intended it as 8, maybe there's a mistake. But perhaps I should proceed with the given input as 9x9. Let me check the other lines.\n\nThird line: ooooooo*o → o o o o o o o * o → 9.\n\nFourth line: o*o****** → o * o * * * * * * → 9?\n\no * o followed by six *? Let me count:\n\no (1), * (2), o (3), *, *, *, *, *, * → that's 3 + 6 = 9? No. Wait, o*o****** has o, *, o, *, *, *, *, *, * → that's 8 characters? Wait, o*o****** is o * o * * * * * * → that's 1, 2, 3, then 6 more? Wait, no. Let me count:\n\nOriginal line: o*o****** → o, *, o, *, *, *, *, * → 8 characters. Oh! So that's 8. Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me re-express each line:\n\nLet me list each line again and count their characters:\n\nLine 1: Ioo*ooooo → I o o * o o o o → 8.\n\nLine 2: o***o***o → o * * * o * * * o → 9? Wait, that's 9. So this is conflicting. But the fourth line is o*o****** which is 8. The fifth line is o*ooooooo → o * o o o o o o → 8. The sixth line is ****o***o → * * * * o * * * o → 9. The seventh line is ooooooo*o → o o o o o o o * o → 9. The eighth line is ******o** → * * * * * * o * * → 9? Let's count:\n\n******o** → 6 *s, then o, then two *s. Total 9. And the ninth line is ooooooooX → 8 o's and X → 9.\n\nSo the maze has 9 lines, but some lines are 8 and others 9. This is inconsistent. But given that the start is in the first line and the end is in the ninth line, perhaps the maze is 9x9. However, some lines have 8 characters, which would make it invalid. This is a problem. Maybe there's a typo in the input. For example, perhaps the second line is supposed to be o***o**** (with four *s at the end?), making it 9 characters. But without knowing, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting, and each line is 8 characters. Let me check again for line 2. Let me try to parse it as 8 characters. For example, maybe the line is o***o*** (without the last o). Then it's 8. Let me check:\n\no***o*** → o * * * o * * * → 8. But the user wrote o***o***o. So perhaps there's a typo. Given this confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that each line is 8 characters. Let me try to adjust the lines accordingly. For example, the second line may have been intended as o***o*** (8 characters). Similarly, the sixth line ****o***o may be ****o*** (8). Let me try to adjust each line to 8 characters:\n\nLet me re-express the maze as 8x8:\n\nRow 0: I o o * o o o o → 8.\n\nRow 1: o * * * o * * * → 8? Original was o***o***o (9). So maybe it's o***o*** (cut off the last o?), making it 8. Let's assume that.\n\nRow 2: ooooooo* → o o o o o o o * → 8.\n\nRow 3: o*o****** → o * o * * * * * → 8.\n\nRow 4: o*ooooooo → o * o o o o o o → 8.\n\nRow 5: ****o*** → * * * * o * * * → 8. Original was ****o***o (9), so cut the last o.\n\nRow 6: ooooooo* → o o o o o o o * → 8. Original was ooooooo*o (9), so cut the last o.\n\nRow 7: ******o* → * * * * * * o * → 8. Original was ******o** (9), so cut the last *.\n\nRow 8: ooooooooX → o o o o o o o o X → 9. But if it's 8, then it's oooooooo (8) and X is in the next line? Not sure. But since we have 8 rows (0-7), maybe the last line is ooooooooX (with 9 characters), but that's conflicting. This is really confusing. But given that the user provided this maze, and the start is in the first line and end in the last, perhaps I should proceed with a 9x9 maze, but there's inconsistency in line lengths. This is a problem. However, given that the user provided the maze as such, perhaps I should proceed with the given lines as they are, even if they are inconsistent, and try to find a path. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the way I'm parsing the input. Let me try to re-express each line as per the user's input, assuming that each line is 8 characters, and that there are typos in some lines.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should treat each line as 9 characters, making it a 9x9 maze. Let's try that. Let me re-express the maze as 9x9:\n\nRow 0: I o o * o o o o o? Wait, original line is Ioo*ooooo → I o o * o o o o o? Let me count: I (1), o (2), o (3), * (4), o (5), o (6), o (7), o (8), o (9)? No, the original line is Ioo*ooooo. Let me count the letters:\n\n\"Ioo*ooooo\" → Let's split into individual characters:\n\nI, o, o, *, o, o, o, o, o → that's 9 characters. Oh! So the first line is 9 characters. So maybe all lines are 9 characters. Let me check again:\n\nFirst line: Ioo*ooooo → I o o * o o o o o → 9.\n\nSecond line: o***o***o → o * * * o * * * o → 9.\n\nThird line: ooooooo*o → o o o o o o o * o → 9.\n\nFourth line: o*o****** → o * o * * * * * * → 9 (o, *, o, *, *, *, *, *, * → 9).\n\nFifth line: o*ooooooo → o * o o o o o o o → 9.\n\nSixth line: ****o***o → * * * * o * * * o → 9.\n\nSeventh line: ooooooo*o → same as third line.\n\nEighth line: ******o** → * * * * * * o * * → 9.\n\nNinth line: ooooooooX → o o o o o o o o X → 9.\n\nAh! So the maze is 9x9. I must have miscounted earlier. So each line is 9 characters. That makes sense. So the maze is 9 rows by 9 columns. So rows 0-8 (0-based) and columns 0-8. Now, I can proceed.\n\nNow, the start is at the 'I' in the first row. Let's find its position. First row (row 0) is Ioo*ooooo. So row 0, column 0 is 'I'. The destination 'X' is at the last row (row 8), last column (column 8). Let me confirm: the last line is ooooooooX → columns 0-8. The X is at (8,8).\n\nNow, the task is to find a path from (0,0) to (8,8), moving up, down, left, right, avoiding walls (marked '*') and passing through 'o's. The output is a list of moves.\n\nTo solve this, I can model the maze as a grid and perform a BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the shortest path. Since the problem allows any path, but likely expects the shortest, BFS is suitable.\n\nLet me first represent the maze as a 2D array. Let me note down the positions:\n\nRow 0: [I, o, o, *, o, o, o, o, o]\nRow 1: [o, *, *, *, o, *, *, *, o]\nRow 2: [o, o, o, o, o, o, o, *, o]\nRow 3: [o, *, o, *, *, *, *, *, *]\nRow 4: [o, *, o, o, o, o, o, o, o]\nRow 5: [*, *, *, *, o, *, *, *, o]\nRow 6: [o, o, o, o, o, o, o, *, o]\nRow 7: [*, *, *, *, *, *, o, *, *]\nRow 8: [o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, X]\n\nWait, let me recheck row 3. Original line for row 3 is o*o****** → which is o, *, o, *, *, *, *, *, * → 9 characters. So row 3 is [o, *, o, *, *, *, *, *, *]. Similarly for others.\n\nNow, starting at (0,0). Let's perform BFS. Let me think of each cell as (row, column). The start is (0,0). The destination is (8,8).\n\nWe need to track visited cells to avoid cycles. Also, we need to track the path taken to reach each cell.\n\nLet me outline the steps for BFS:\n\nInitialize a queue with the starting position. Each queue element contains the current position and the path taken to get there. Mark the starting position as visited.\n\nWhile the queue is not empty:\n\n- Dequeue the first element (current position and path)\n- If current position is the destination, return the path\n- For each possible move (up, down, left, right):\n   - Calculate the new position\n   - Check if new position is within bounds (0<=row<9, 0<=col<9)\n   - Check if the cell is not a wall ('*') and not visited\n   - If so, enqueue the new position with the updated path, and mark as visited.\n\nNow, let's simulate this process.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, I need to be careful. Let's start.\n\nStart at (0,0). Let's represent positions as (row, col). The path starts as empty.\n\nFirst, enqueue ((0,0), []).\n\nVisited: {(0,0): True}\n\nDequeue (0,0) with path [].\n\nCheck if (0,0) is (8,8)? No.\n\nCheck possible moves:\n\nFrom (0,0), possible moves:\n\nRight (to (0,1)), Down (to (1,0)).\n\nUp and Left are out of bounds.\n\nCheck (0,1): cell is 'o' (row 0, column 1 is o). Not visited. Enqueue ((0,1), ['right']).\n\nCheck (1,0): cell is 'o' (row 1, column 0 is o). Enqueue ((1,0), ['down']).\n\nNow, queue has these two elements. Let's proceed with BFS level by level.\n\nLet me proceed step by step, but this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a path manually by looking at the maze.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to trace a possible path.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's look for a path.\n\nFrom (0,0), can go right to (0,1), then (0,2). But in row 0, column 3 is a wall (*). So from (0,0), moving right to (0,1) and (0,2), then maybe down?\n\nLet me try:\n\nPath:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nRight to (0,1).\n\nRight to (0,2).\n\nNow, can't go further right (column 3 is blocked). Let's try down to (1,2). But row 1, column 2 is * (row 1 is [o, *, *, *, o, *, *, *, o]. So row 1, column 0 is o, column 1 is *, column 2 is *, etc. So from (0,2), moving down to (1,2) would be into a * (wall). Not allowed. So can't go down there. So from (0,2), possible moves are right (blocked at column 3), down (wall), left (back to 0,1). So maybe need to go down from (0,0) first.\n\nAlternative path: from (0,0) down to (1,0).\n\n(1,0) is o. From here, possible moves:\n\nDown to (2,0) (row 2, column 0 is o). Or right to (1,1) which is * (blocked). So down to (2,0).\n\nSo path so far: down, down.\n\nAt (2,0). From here, can move right or down. Let's see row 2: [o, o, o, o, o, o, o, *, o]. So column 0 is o. From (2,0), can move right to (2,1), (2,2), etc., or down to (3,0).\n\nLet me try moving right. From (2,0), moving right to (2,1), (2,2)... Let's see. Let's try to go all the way right until possible.\n\nBut row 2 has a wall at column 7 (row 2, column 7 is *). So from (2,0), moving right to (2,1), (2,2)... up to column 6 (o), then column 7 is *.\n\nSo from (2,0), moving right to (2,1), then (2,2)... let's say we go to (2,6), then can't go further right. From there, maybe down or up?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better path. Let me think.\n\nFrom (2,0), perhaps moving down to (3,0). Let's check row 3, column 0: o. From (3,0), possible moves: right to (3,1) which is *, so no. Or down to (4,0): row 4, column 0 is o. So down again.\n\nFrom (4,0), can move right? Row 4 is [o, *, o, o, o, o, o, o, o]. So column 0 is o, column 1 is *, so can't go right. Down to (5,0)? Row 5, column 0 is * (row 5 starts with ****o...). So (5,0) is * (wall). So can't go down. So from (4,0), can go right? No. Up to (3,0)? Already visited. So maybe from (4,0), need to go right to column 2? Wait, row 4, column 0 is o. Column 1 is *, column 2 is o. So from (4,0), can we move right? No, because column 1 is *. So stuck? No, maybe from (4,0) move up? But already came from up. So perhaps this path is not working. Let me backtrack.\n\nAlternative: from (2,0), move right to (2,1), then down?\n\nAt (2,1), which is o. From there, can move down to (3,1). Row 3, column 1 is * (row 3 is [o, *, o, *, *, *, *, *, *]. So column 1 is *, so can't move there. So no. From (2,1), can move right to (2,2), which is o. Then down to (3,2). Row 3, column 2 is o. So yes.\n\nSo path: down, down, right, right, down.\n\nAt (3,2). From here, can move right to (3,3) which is *, so no. Down to (4,2). Row 4, column 2 is o. So down.\n\nPath continues: down.\n\nAt (4,2). From here, can move right, down, up?\n\nRow 4, column 2 is o. Let's move right to (4,3), which is o. Then continue right as far as possible. Row 4 has from column 2 onwards o's until column 8. So from (4,2), moving right all the way to column 8?\n\nYes. So path: right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right (from column 2 to 8). That would get to (4,8). From there, can we move down or up?\n\nRow 4, column 8 is o. From there, down to row 5, column 8. Row 5, column 8 is o. Let me check row 5: [*, *, *, *, o, *, *, *, o]. So column 8 is o. So from (4,8), down to (5,8).\n\nThen from (5,8), can move down to (6,8). Row 6, column 8 is o (row 6 is [o, o, o, o, o, o, o, *, o]. Wait, row 6's last column (column 8) is o. Then from (6,8), can move down to (7,8). Row 7, column 8 is * (row 7: ******o** → columns 0-8: *, *, *, *, *, *, o, *, * → column 8 is *). So (7,8) is *, can't go there. So from (6,8), can move left? Column 7 is * (row 6, column 7 is *). So can't move left. Or up?\n\nFrom (6,8), up to (5,8) (already visited). So maybe from (5,8), move left? Let's see. From (5,8), column is 8. Row 5, column 4 is o (position (5,4)), but there are walls in between. Let me check row 5: columns 0-3 are *, column 4 is o, column 5 is *, etc. So from (5,8), can't move left past column 4. Because columns 5-7 are *.\n\nSo perhaps from (5,8), need to move up to row 4, column 8 (already visited), or down to row 6, column 8 (already at that point). This path seems stuck. Let me backtrack.\n\nLet me retrace the steps. Let's see where I was:\n\nStarting from (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,1) → right to (2,2) → down to (3,2) → down to (4,2) → right to (4,8) → down to (5,8). Now stuck.\n\nAlternative path from (4,2): instead of going all the way right, perhaps take another route. Let me think. From (4,2), maybe move up?\n\nFrom (4,2), up to (3,2). Which is o. From there, can move right? (3,3) is * (row 3, column 3 is *). So no. Or left? Already came from there. Or down again. So no help.\n\nAlternative: from (4,2), move down to (5,2). Let's check row 5, column 2. Row 5 is [*, *, *, *, o, *, *, *, o]. So column 2 is * (since first four columns are *). So can't move there. So no. So from (4,2), can't go down. So the only way is right. So perhaps this path is not working. Need to find another way.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's look for possible paths from the start.\n\nAlternative path: from (0,0) go right to (0,1), (0,2). From (0,2), can we go down? Let's check row 1, column 2. Row 1 is [o, *, *, *, o, *, *, *, o]. Column 2 is *, so can't go down. So no. From (0,2), can go right to (0,3)? No, it's a wall. So stuck. So the only viable initial move seems to be down to (1,0).\n\nAnother idea: maybe there's a way to go from row 0, column 0 down to row 1,0, then right to row 1,4? But row 1 has * in column 1, 2, 3. Let me check row 1: columns 0 is o, 1 is *, 2 is *, 3 is *, 4 is o, then *, *, *, o. So from (1,0), can move right to column 4? No, because columns 1-3 are blocked. So need to go down from (1,0) to (2,0).\n\nSo back to the earlier path. Let me think again.\n\nAt (4,2), moving right to (4,8), then down to (5,8), then maybe left? But from (5,8), can't go left because columns 5-7 are blocked. How about from (5,8), move up to (4,8), then left? But already tried that. Maybe from (4,8), go left to (4,4), then down?\n\nWait, from (4,8), moving left to (4,7), (4,6)... Let me check row 4: columns 0-8. From column 2 onwards, it's all o's. So from (4,8), moving left all the way to column 2. Then perhaps down?\n\nAt (4,2), already visited. So no help.\n\nAlternative idea: from (4,2), instead of going all the way right, go down to row 5, but only if possible. Let me check row 5, column 2. As before, it's * (row 5's first four columns are *). So can't go there. So no.\n\nHmm. Let me think of other paths. Perhaps from (2,0), instead of going right, go down to (3,0). Let's try that.\n\nFrom (2,0) down to (3,0). (3,0) is o. From there, can move down to (4,0). (4,0) is o. From (4,0), down to (5,0). But row 5, column 0 is * (row 5 starts with four *s). So can't go there. So from (4,0), can't go down. So from (4,0), can move right? Column 1 is * (row 4, column 1 is *), so no. So stuck again. So this path also leads nowhere.\n\nAlternative path: from (2,0), move down to (3,0), then right to (3,2). Let me see. From (3,0), can move right to (3,1)? No, it's *. From (3,0), can move right to (3,2)? No, because column 1 is *, so need to go through column 1? No. So can't. So no.\n\nAlternative: from (2,0), go right to (2,1), then down to (3,1)? No, row 3, column 1 is *.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let me try to look for a path from the end and work backwards.\n\nThe destination is at (8,8). Let's see what leads to it. The cell before must be (8,7) or (7,8). Let me check row 8: ooooooooX. So (8,7) is o, (8,8) is X. From (8,7), to reach X, need to move right. But (8,7) is o. What leads to (8,7)? It could come from (7,7) or (8,6). Let's check row 7, column 7: row 7 is ******o** → columns 0-8: *, *, *, *, *, *, o, *, *. So (7,7) is *. So can't come from there. So the previous cell must be (8,6). From (8,6), move right to (8,7). Now, what leads to (8,6)? It could come from (7,6) or (8,5). Let's check row 8, column 6 is o. Let's look at (7,6): row 7, column 6 is o. So from (7,6) down to (8,6). Is row 7, column 6 passable? Yes. So if there's a path to (7,6), then we can go down to (8,6), then right to (8,7), then right to X.\n\nSo let's try to find a path to (7,6).\n\nFrom (7,6), how to get there? Let's see. (7,6) is in row 7, column 6. Looking at row 7: columns 0-5 are *, column 6 is o, column 7 is *, column 8 is *. So to reach (7,6), must come from above (row 6, column 6) or left (row 7, column 5, which is *). So only from (6,6).\n\nSo path to (7,6) is from (6,6). Let's check row 6, column 6: o. From there, down to (7,6). Now, how to get to (6,6). Let's see. (6,6) is in row 6, which is [o, o, o, o, o, o, o, *, o]. So column 6 is o. Can come from (6,5), (5,6), or (6,7) (but column 7 is *). So likely from (5,6) or (6,5).\n\nLet me try to find a path to (6,6). Let's say from (6,5). How to get to (6,5)? Let's think recursively.\n\nThis backward approach might help. Let's try to outline a possible path:\n\nFrom (8,8), previous steps: (8,7) → from (8,6) → from (7,6) → from (6,6).\n\nNow, how to get to (6,6). Let's say from (6,5). From there, right to (6,6). To get to (6,5), perhaps from (5,5) or (6,4). Let's check row 6, column 5 is o. Let's say from (5,5). But row 5, column 5 is * (row 5: ****o***o → columns 0-3 are *, column 4 is o, column 5 is *, etc.). So (5,5) is *. Can't come from there. So from (6,5), must come from up, left, or down. Assuming up from (5,5) is blocked, then maybe left from (6,4). Let's assume that.\n\nSo path to (6,5) from (6,4). How to get to (6,4)? Let's say from (5,4) down. Row 5, column 4 is o. From there, down to (6,4). Now, how to get to (5,4). Let's think.\n\nRow 5, column 4 is o. How to get there? From (4,4), (5,3), (5,5) (blocked). So likely from (4,4) up or down.\n\nLet me think of a path to (5,4). Let's say from row 4, column 4. Which is in row 4, which is [o, *, o, o, o, o, o, o, o]. So column 4 is o. From there, down to (5,4). To get to (4,4), perhaps from earlier steps.\n\nFrom earlier, in the earlier path, when we were at (4,2), moving right to (4,4). Yes! So if we can get to (4,4), then down to (5,4), then down to (6,4), right to (6,5), right to (6,6), down to (7,6), right to (8,6), right to (8,7), right to X.\n\nLet me outline this path:\n\nFrom earlier steps, path to (4,2) was down, down, right, right, down. Then from (4,2), move right to (4,4). Then down to (5,4), down to (6,4), right to (6,5), right to (6,6), down to (7,6), down to (8,6), right to (8,7), right to X.\n\nLet me check if this works.\n\nSo from (4,2) → right to (4,3), (4,4). Yes. Then down to (5,4). Is (5,4) o? Yes, as row 5, column 4 is o. Then down to (6,4), which is o. From there, right to (6,5) (o), then to (6,6) (o). Then down to (7,6) (o). Then down to (8,6) (o). Then right to (8,7), then right to X.\n\nYes! So this seems like a viable path. Now, I need to trace the moves from start to end.\n\nLet me reconstruct the path step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\n1. Down to (1,0)\n2. Down to (2,0)\n3. Right to (2,1)\n4. Right to (2,2)\n5. Down to (3,2)\n6. Down to (4,2)\n7. Right to (4,3)\n8. Right to (4,4)\n9. Down to (5,4)\n10. Down to (6,4)\n11. Right to (6,5)\n12. Right to (6,6)\n13. Down to (7,6)\n14. Down to (8,6)\n15. Right to (8,7)\n16. Right to (8,8)\n\nNow, converting these steps into move directions.\n\nEach step is a move from one cell to another. Let's list the moves:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): down.\n\nFrom (1,0) to (2,0): down.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (2,1): right.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (2,2): right.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (3,2): down.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (4,2): down.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (4,3): right.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,4): right.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (5,4): down.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (6,4): down.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (6,5): right.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (6,6): right.\n\nFrom (6,6) to (7,6): down.\n\nFrom (7,6) to (8,6): down.\n\nFrom (8,6) to (8,7): right.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (8,8): right.\n\nSo the list of moves is: ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right'].\n\nBut let me check if there are any obstacles in these steps.\n\nFor example, step 9: from (4,4) down to (5,4). Row 5, column 4 is o. Yes.\n\nStep 10: from (5,4) down to (6,4). Row 6, column 4 is o. Yes.\n\nSteps 11-12: right twice to (6,6). Yes.\n\nStep 13: down to (7,6). Yes, row 7, column 6 is o.\n\nStep 14: down to (8,6). Yes, row 8, column 6 is o.\n\nSteps 15-16: right twice. Yes.\n\nThis seems valid. Now, converting this into the required list of moves. The answer would be this list.\n\nBut let me make sure there are no other walls along this path.\n\nLet me verify each position:\n\n(0,0): I.\n\n(1,0): o.\n\n(2,0): o.\n\n(2,1): o.\n\n(2,2): o.\n\n(3,2): o (row 3, column 2 is o).\n\n(4,2): o.\n\n(4,3): o (row 4, column 3 is o).\n\n(4,4): o.\n\n(5,4): o.\n\n(6,4): o.\n\n(6,5): o.\n\n(6,6): o.\n\n(7,6): o.\n\n(8,6): o.\n\n(8,7): o.\n\n(8,8): X.\n\nAll these positions are passable. Great!\n\nSo the moves are as listed. Now, converting this into the required format: a list of 'down', 'right', etc.\n\nThe moves are:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right']\n\nBut let me count again the number of steps:\n\nSteps 1-16, which is 16 moves. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nYes. Each move is one step. So the list has 16 elements.\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path. For example, maybe there's a way to avoid some of these repeated moves. However, since BFS would find the shortest path, and this path seems valid, I think it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different route. But given the maze structure, this path seems to work.\n\nThus, the answer is the list of moves as above.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','right','right','down','down','right','right','down','down','right','right','down','down','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this maze problem. The user provided an n x n maze where 'I' is the start, 'X' is the end. The path can be made of 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right' moves. My job is to find the correct path from start to finish.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the maze. Let me try to visualize it. Each line represents a row. Let me count the rows to see how big the maze is. Let me count: there are 12 rows here. Each row has 12 characters? Let me check the first line: \"Ioo*ooo*ooo*o\". Let's count the characters. Let's see, maybe each row is 12? Let me check the first line. Let's split it into parts. Maybe it's 14 characters? Wait, maybe I need to be careful. Let me count:\n\nFirst line: I o o * o o o * o o o * o → Let's see: that's 13 characters? Or maybe I miscounted. Let me write it out:\n\nOriginal line: \"Ioo*ooo*ooo*o\". Let's count each character:\n\nI, o, o, *, o, o, o, *, o, o, o, *, o → that's 13 characters. Wait, but the next lines may vary. Wait, but if it's an n x n maze, all rows must be the same length. Let me check another row. For example, the second line is \"o*o*o***o***o\". Let's count:\n\no * o * o * * * o * * * o → Hmm, maybe that's 13 as well. Let me count again:\n\no * o * o * * * o * * * o → that's 13 characters. Yes. So the maze is 12x12? Wait, no, 12 rows and 13 columns? Wait, no. Wait, the user says it's an n x n maze. So maybe each row is 12 characters? Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first line is \"Ioo*ooo*ooo*o\". Let me count each character:\n\nI (1), o (2), o (3), * (4), o (5), o (6), o (7), * (8), o (9), o (10), o (11), * (12), o (13). Oh, that's 13 characters. But the user says it's n x n. So perhaps there's a typo in the maze, or maybe I need to check again. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. But given that the problem says it's n x n, perhaps each row is 12 characters. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again. Let me take the first line again:\n\n\"Ioo*ooo*ooo*o\" — perhaps it's 12 characters. Let me split into parts. Let's see:\n\nI o o * o o o * o o o * o — but that's 13. Wait, maybe there's a missing * or something? Alternatively, perhaps the actual maze is 13x13? Let me count the rows. The user provided 12 rows. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the maze:\n\nRow 1: Ioo*ooo*ooo*o\nRow 2: o*o*o***o***o\nRow 3: o*ooooooooooo\nRow 4: **o***o*****o\nRow 5: ooooo*ooooo*o\nRow 6: **o***o*o****\nRow 7: ooooo*o*ooooo\nRow 8: **o**********\nRow 9: o*ooooooo*ooo\nRow 10: o*o*o***o*o**\nRow 11: ooo*ooo*ooooo\nRow 12: o***o***o*o**\nRow 13: ooo*ooo*o*ooX\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me count again. The user wrote 12 rows? Let me check. The last line is \"ooo*ooo*o*ooX\" — that's row 13? Let me recount:\n\n1. Ioo*ooo*ooo*o\n2. o*o*o***o***o\n3. o*ooooooooooo\n4. **o***o*****o\n5. ooooo*ooooo*o\n6. **o***o*o****\n7. ooooo*o*ooooo\n8. **o**********\n9. o*ooooooo*ooo\n10. o*o*o***o*o**\n11. ooo*ooo*ooooo\n12. o***o***o*o**\n13. ooo*ooo*o*ooX\n\nAh, there are 13 rows. So the maze is 13x13? Let me check the first row's length. Let me count again for row 1: \"Ioo*ooo*ooo*o\". Let's count the characters:\n\nI, o, o, *, o, o, o, *, o, o, o, *, o → that's 13 characters. So the maze is 13x13. So n is 13. Got it. So each row is 13 characters, and there are 13 rows. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the path from 'I' to 'X'. Since the user wants the path as a list of directions (up, down, left, right), I need to model the maze and find a valid path.\n\nFirst, I need to find where the start and end points are.\n\nLet's find the starting point 'I'. It's in the first row, first column. Let me check row 1 (index 0?), first character is 'I'. So coordinates (0,0) if rows and columns start at 0. Let me confirm:\n\nRow 1 (row index 0):\n\nIoo*ooo*ooo*o → first character is I at (0,0).\n\nEnd point is 'X' in the last row. Let me check row 13 (index 12?), last line: \"ooo*ooo*o*ooX\". Let me count the characters. The last character is X. Let's see: the line is ooo*ooo*o*ooX. Let me count the characters:\n\nAssuming each character is separated, the X is at position 12 (if columns are 0-based). So the end is at (12,12) perhaps? Let me check:\n\nThe line is 13 characters. Let's count:\n\nPositions 0-12. The last character is X. So yes, the end is at (12,12).\n\nNow, the problem is to find a path from (0,0) to (12,12), moving through 'o's and avoiding 'X's. The available moves are up, down, left, right. So standard BFS or DFS can be used here. Since the user wants any valid path, perhaps BFS is better to find the shortest path, but since the problem doesn't specify shortest, any path is acceptable.\n\nBut since the maze is complex, I need to model it.\n\nLet me try to represent the maze as a grid. Let me create a 2D array where each cell is either passable ('o' or 'I' or 'X') or a wall ('*').\n\nBut for the purposes of pathfinding, the start is considered passable, and the end is also passable. So during traversal, I can treat 'I' as passable (start), 'o' as passable, and 'X' as the destination.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the starting position (row, column) — (0,0).\n2. Use BFS to find a path to the end (12,12).\n3. Keep track of the path taken.\n4. Convert the coordinates into the directions (up, down, left, right).\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, I need to simulate BFS step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can trace the path step by step, making sure not to hit walls and not to loop.\n\nLet me start by trying to trace a path manually.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's look at the first row:\n\nRow 0: I o o * o o o * o o o * o\n\nSo positions 0 to 12:\n\n0: I\n1: o\n2: o\n3: *\n4: o\n5: o\n6: o\n7: *\n8: o\n9: o\n10: o\n11: *\n12: o\n\nSo from (0,0), possible moves: can we go right or down?\n\nAt (0,0), adjacent cells:\n\nLeft: invalid (out of bounds)\nUp: invalid\nRight: (0,1) which is 'o' — passable.\nDown: (1,0) which is 'o' (row 1, column 0 is 'o')?\n\nLet me check row 1: \"o*o*o***o***o\". So row 1, column 0 is 'o'.\n\nSo from (0,0), possible moves are right and down.\n\nLet me try to go down first. Let's try to explore possible paths.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, I need to be careful. Let me think of possible paths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to use BFS. Let me try to outline the steps.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, let me try to sketch the path.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let me try to move right as much as possible until I hit a wall, then down, etc. But that's not systematic. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: since the maze is 13x13, perhaps the path requires moving through multiple rows and columns, avoiding walls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the path step by step.\n\nLet me start at (0,0). Let me check possible directions.\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\nRight to (0,1). Let's go right first. Then maybe proceed.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better approach. Let me try to find the path.\n\nLet me try to outline the maze step by step.\n\nRow 0: I o o * o o o * o o o * o\n\nRow 1: o * o * o * * * o * * * o\n\nRow 2: o * o o o o o o o o o o o\n\nRow 3: * * o * * * o * * * * o\n\nWait, no, let me recheck the rows:\n\nOriginal maze rows as provided:\n\nRow 0: Ioo*ooo*ooo*o → [0,0] is I, then o, o, *, then ooo* etc.\n\nRow 1: o*o*o***o***o\n\nRow 2: o*ooooooooooo\n\nRow 3: **o***o*****o\n\nRow 4: ooooo*ooooo*o\n\nRow 5: **o***o*o****\n\nRow 6: ooooo*o*ooooo\n\nRow 7: **o**********\n\nRow 8: o*ooooooo*ooo\n\nRow 9: o*o*o***o*o**\n\nRow 10: ooo*ooo*ooooo\n\nRow 11: o***o***o*o**\n\nRow 12: ooo*ooo*o*ooX\n\nSo for example, row 2 is \"o*ooooooooooo\" — which is o * o o o o o o o o o o o ?\n\nWait, let me count the characters. For row 2, the string is \"o*ooooooooooo\". Let's count:\n\no * o o o o o o o o o o o → that's 1 (o), 2 (*), then 11 o's. Total 13 characters. Yes. So row 2 has a wall at column 1, and the rest are o's.\n\nSo row 2 is passable except for column 1.\n\nNow, let me try to find a path.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's consider possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (0,1). Then right to (0,2). Next, column 3 is a wall (*). So from (0,2), can't go right. Can we go down? Let's check (1,2). Row 1, column 2: looking at row 1: o*o*o***o***o. Let's split into positions:\n\nRow 1: positions 0-12:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: *\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: *\n\n11: *\n\n12: o\n\nSo at (1,2) is 'o' — passable. So from (0,2), moving down to (1,2).\n\nSo path so far: right, right, down.\n\nThen from (1,2), what's next? Let's see. From (1,2), possible directions: up is (0,2) already visited. Right to (1,3) which is * (wall). Left to (1,1) which is * (wall). Down to (2,2) which is o (row 2, column 2 is o). So move down to (2,2).\n\nNow path: right, right, down, down.\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves. Let's see. Let's look at row 2, column 2 is o. What's around?\n\nUp is (1,2), already visited. Down is (3,2). Let's check row 3, column 2. Row 3 is \"**o***o*****o\". Let's split:\n\nRow 3:\n\n0: *\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: *\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: *\n\n9: *\n\n10: *\n\n11: *\n\n12: o\n\nSo (3,2) is o. So can move down to (3,2). Path: add 'down'.\n\nFrom (3,2), possible directions. Let's check. Up is (2,2), already there. Let's see other directions. Left? (3,1) is * (from row 3's first two *). Right? (3,3) is *.\n\nSo can only move down or up? Or maybe other directions? Wait, what about down? (4,2). Let's check row 4, column 2. Row 4: \"ooooo*ooooo*o\". Let's see:\n\nRow 4: positions 0-12:\n\nAssuming it's o o o o o * o o o o o * o.\n\nSo column 2 is o. So (4,2) is o. So from (3,2), move down to (4,2). Path: down again.\n\nNow path is right, right, down, down, down.\n\nFrom (4,2), possible directions. Let's see. Up is (3,2). Let's look for other options. Let's check right. Row 4, column 3 is o. So can move right to (4,3). Let's go right. Path adds 'right'.\n\nNow at (4,3). Let's see. From here, can we go further right? Let's check. Row 4's structure: up to position 4, then at position 5 is *, then o's again. Let me recheck:\n\nRow 4: \"ooooo*ooooo*o\". Let me split:\n\nAssuming that the string is 5 o's, then a *, then 5 o's, then a *, then o. So positions 0-4: o's, position 5: *, positions 6-10: o's, position 11: *, position 12: o. So column 5 is *, column 6 is o. So from (4,3), moving right to (4,4), then (4,5) is *, so can't go further. So perhaps from (4,3), moving right, then down or up?\n\nAlternatively, let's try to move further. From (4,3), moving right to (4,4), then (4,5) is *, which is a wall. So can't. So from (4,3), possible directions: left (back), up, down, or right to (4,4) but then can't proceed. Let me check down. Row 5, column 3. Row 5 is \"**o***o*o****\". Let's parse:\n\nRow 5: \"**o***o*o****\" → positions 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: *, 11: *, 12: *.\n\nSo (5,3) is *, wall. Can't go down. Up is (3,3) which is * (from row 3). So up is wall. So from (4,3), can't go up or down. So only options are left or right. If we go right to (4,4), but then can't proceed further. So perhaps this path is a dead end. So maybe we need to backtrack.\n\nSo from (4,3), we came from (4,2). Let me backtrack. So perhaps from (4,2), instead of moving right, we should try other directions. Let's see. From (4,2), what other directions are available?\n\nLooking at (4,2), possible moves:\n\nLeft: (4,1) — what is that? Row 4, column 1 is o (since row 4 starts with ooooo...). So (4,1) is o. Can we move left? Let me check. If we came from (4,2) to (4,3), but if we are at (4,2), moving left to (4,1). Let's try that. So path would have added 'left' from (4,2) to (4,1). But how did we get to (4,2)? From (3,2) down. So path would be down, then left. But maybe that's a detour. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,2), can we move down? Let's check (5,2). Row 5, column 2 is o (row 5: **o...). Yes. So from (4,2), moving down to (5,2). Let me try that. So path adds 'down'.\n\nSo from (4,2) down to (5,2).\n\nNow at (5,2). Let's check. From here, what's possible? Up is (4,2), already visited. Let's look around. Right? (5,3) is * (as before). Left? (5,1) is * (row 5 starts with **o...). Down? (6,2). Row 6: \"ooooo*o*ooooo\". Let's check row 6's column 2. Row 6: positions 0-12:\n\nAssuming it's ooooo*o*ooooo. Let me split:\n\nColumns 0-4: o's, column 5: *, column 6: o, column 7: *, then columns 8-12: o's. So (6,2) is o. So can move down to (6,2). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (6,2). Let's see. From here, possible directions. Up is (5,2). Let's see other options. Right? (6,3) is *? Let me check row 6's column 3: since row 6 is ooooo*o*ooooo. So columns 0-4 are o, column 5 is *, column 6 is o, column 7 is *, then columns 8-12 are o. So (6,3) is o? Wait, no. Wait, if columns 0-4 are o's, then column 5 is *, then column 6 is o. So column 3 is within 0-4, so yes, o. So (6,3) is o. So can move right. Let's try moving right to (6,3). Then right again to (6,4), etc. Let's see:\n\nFrom (6,2), moving right to (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5) is *? No, column 5 is *, so (6,5) is *, so can't go there. So from (6,3), can we proceed further right? Let's check. From (6,3), moving right to (6,4) (o), then (6,5) is *, which is blocked. So from (6,3), can we go down or up?\n\nAlternatively, maybe from (6,2), moving down? Let's check (7,2). Row 7 is \"**o**********\". Let me parse row 7:\n\nRow 7: \"**o**********\" → columns 0 and 1 are *, column 2 is o, then columns 3-12 are *? Let me count. The string is \"**o**********\". That's 2 *'s, then o, then 10 *'s. So yes. So (7,2) is o. So from (6,2), moving down to (7,2). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (7,2). From here, possible directions. Up is (6,2). Let's check other options. Left is (7,1) which is *, right is (7,3) which is *. So no way to go except up or...? Wait, what about down? Row 8, column 2. Row 8 is \"o*ooooooo*ooo\". Let me parse row 8:\n\nRow 8: o * o o o o o o o * o o o. Let me split into positions:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: o\n\n4: o\n\n5: o\n\n6: o\n\n7: o\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: o\n\n11: o\n\n12: o\n\nSo (8,2) is o. So from (7,2), can move down to (8,2). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (8,2). Let's see. From here, possible directions: up is (7,2), left is (8,1) which is *, right is (8,3) which is o. Let's move right. Path adds 'right' to (8,3).\n\nFrom (8,3), can move right again to (8,4), (8,5), etc. Let's see:\n\n(8,3) → (8,4): o. (8,4) → (8,5): o. Continue until blocked? Let's check. Row 8's column 9 is *, so columns up to 8: column 9 is blocked. Let me think: from (8,2), moving right to (8,3), then to (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9) is *? Let me check:\n\nRow 8 is \"o*ooooooo*ooo\". So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, then columns 2-8 are o's? Wait:\n\nOriginal row 8: o*ooooooo*ooo. Let me count the characters. Let's see:\n\no * o o o o o o o * o o o → that's 13 characters. So positions:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: o\n\n4: o\n\n5: o\n\n6: o\n\n7: o\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: o\n\n11: o\n\n12: o\n\nSo columns 2-8 are o's (positions 2-8 inclusive). So from (8,2), moving right to (8,8) is possible. Then (8,9) is *, so can't go further. So from (8,3), moving right all the way to (8,8). Let's say we go right until (8,8). Then what? From (8,8), can we move down or up?\n\nUp is (7,8), which is * (row 7, columns 3-12 are *). Down is (9,8). Let's check row 9, column 8. Row 9 is \"o*o*o***o*o**\".\n\nRow 9: o * o * o * * * o * o * * → let me parse:\n\nAssuming it's o * o * o * * * o * o * * → positions 0-12:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: *\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: o\n\n11: *\n\n12: *\n\nSo (9,8) is o. So from (8,8), moving down to (9,8). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (9,8). Let's see. From here, possible directions. Up is (8,8), already visited. Let's check other directions. Let's look around:\n\nLeft: (9,7) is * (row 9, column 7 is *). Right: (9,9) is *? Yes. Down: (10,8). Let me check row 10, column 8. Row 10 is \"ooo*ooo*ooooo\".\n\nRow 10: \"ooo*ooo*ooooo\". Let me parse:\n\nColumns 0-2: o's, column 3: *, columns 4-6: o's, column 7: *, columns 8-12: o's. So (10,8) is o. So from (9,8), can move down to (10,8). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (10,8). Let's check. From here, possible directions. Up is (9,8). Let's look for other options. Right: (10,9) is o. Let's move right to (10,9). Then (10,10), (10,11), (10,12) are o's. Let's go all the way to (10,12). But need to check if that's allowed. From row 10's structure, columns 8-12 are o's. So yes. So path adds 'right' multiple times. Let's say from (10,8) to (10,12). Then, from there, what's next?\n\nAt (10,12), possible directions. Down is (11,12). Let me check row 11, column 12. Row 11 is \"o***o***o*o**\". Let me parse:\n\nRow 11: o * * * o * * * o * o * * → positions:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: *\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: *\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: o\n\n11: *\n\n12: *\n\nSo (11,12) is *, wall. Can't go down. Up is (9,12)? No, up is (9,12)? Wait, current position is (10,12). Up is row 9, column 12. From row 9's structure, column 12 is * (as per earlier parsing). So up is blocked. Left? Let's see. From (10,12), moving left to (10,11), which is o. Let's backtrack a bit. Maybe from (10,8), moving down to (11,8). Let me check row 11, column 8. Row 11's column 8 is o (from earlier parsing). So from (10,8), down to (11,8). Let me try that instead of going right all the way.\n\nSo from (10,8), down to (11,8). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (11,8). Let's see. Row 11's column 8 is o. From here, possible directions. Up is (10,8). Let's check other options. Let's look around. Right: (11,9) is o (from row 11's parsing: column 9 is *? Wait row 11 is \"o***o***o*o**\". Let me recheck:\n\nRow 11: positions 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o, 11: *, 12: *.\n\nSo (11,8) is o. Right to (11,9) is *, blocked. Left to (11,7) is * (column 7 is *). Down to (12,8). Let me check row 12, column 8. Row 12 is \"ooo*ooo*o*ooX\". Let's parse:\n\nRow 12: o o o * o o o * o * o o X. Let me count:\n\nAssuming it's:\n\n0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o, 11: o, 12: X.\n\nSo (12,8) is o. So from (11,8), move down to (12,8). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (12,8). From here, possible directions. Up is (11,8). Let's look for a way to reach (12,12). Let's check the surrounding. Right: (12,9) is *, blocked. Down is out of bounds. Left: (12,7) is * (row 12's column 7 is *). So can't go left or right. What about moving left from (12,8) to (12,7)? No, it's a *. So stuck? Or perhaps there's another path.\n\nHmm. Maybe this path is a dead end. Let me backtrack.\n\nWe came to (12,8) from (11,8), which came from (10,8). Let me think of alternatives.\n\nAt (10,8), instead of going down to (11,8), what if we go right to (10,9), (10,10), (10,11), (10,12). Let's try that again.\n\nAt (10,8), moving right to (10,9) (o), then (10,10) (o), (10,11) (o), (10,12) (o). Now at (10,12). From here, can we move down to (11,12)? No, because row 11, column 12 is *. What about moving up? Up is row 9, column 12, which is * (as before). Left? Let's move left to (10,11), then down?\n\nFrom (10,12), move left to (10,11). Then down to (11,11). Let me check row 11, column 11 is * (from earlier parsing). Can't go there. Alternatively, from (10,11), move down to (11,11) which is *, blocked. Not helpful. What about from (10,12), move left to (10,11), then left to (10,10), then down?\n\nFrom (10,10), down to (11,10). Let's check row 11, column 10 is o (from earlier parsing: row 11, column 10 is o). So yes. So from (10,10), down to (11,10). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (11,10). Let's see. From here, possible directions: up is (10,10). Let's check other options. Right is (11,11) which is *, left is (11,9) which is *, down to (12,10). Let me check row 12, column 10 is o (from row 12's parsing: column 10 is o). So move down to (12,10). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (12,10). From here, possible directions: left to (12,9) is *, right to (12,11) is o. Let me check row 12's column 11 is o, and column 12 is X. So from (12,10), move right to (12,11). Then right to (12,12) which is X. So that's the end! \n\nSo let's trace this path:\n\nFrom (10,8) → right to (10,9) → right to (10,10) → down to (11,10) → down to (12,10) → right to (12,11) → right to (12,12).\n\nSo the directions for these steps would be:\n\nFrom (10,8) to (10,9): right.\n\nFrom (10,9) to (10,10): right.\n\nFrom (10,10) to (11,10): down.\n\nFrom (11,10) to (12,10): down.\n\nFrom (12,10) to (12,11): right.\n\nFrom (12,11) to (12,12): right.\n\nSo adding these directions to the path.\n\nNow, let me reconstruct the entire path up to this point.\n\nLet me recap the steps taken so far:\n\nStarting from (0,0):\n\nright → (0,1)\n\nright → (0,2)\n\ndown → (1,2)\n\ndown → (2,2)\n\ndown → (3,2)\n\ndown → (4,2)\n\ndown → (5,2)\n\ndown → (6,2)\n\ndown → (7,2)\n\ndown → (8,2)\n\nright → (8,3)\n\n... and so on until reaching (10,8), then proceeding as above.\n\nWait, earlier steps:\n\nStarting from (0,0):\n\nright, right, down, down, down (from (0,2) to (3,2)), then down to (4,2), then down to (5,2), then down to (6,2), then down to (7,2), then down to (8,2). That's several 'down's. Let me count:\n\nFrom (0,2) to (1,2): down.\n\nThen (1,2) to (2,2): down.\n\nThen (2,2) to (3,2): down.\n\nThen (3,2) to (4,2): down.\n\nThen (4,2) to (5,2): down.\n\nThen (5,2) to (6,2): down.\n\nThen (6,2) to (7,2): down.\n\nThen (7,2) to (8,2): down.\n\nSo that's 8 'down's after the initial two 'right's. Then from (8,2) to (8,3): right. Then from (8,3) to (8,8): right multiple times. Then down to (9,8), down to (10,8). Then from there, right, right, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut I need to track all the directions accurately. Let me try to outline each step with their directions.\n\nLet me write down each move:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\n1. right → (0,1)\n2. right → (0,2)\n3. down → (1,2)\n4. down → (2,2)\n5. down → (3,2)\n6. down → (4,2)\n7. down → (5,2)\n8. down → (6,2)\n9. down → (7,2)\n10. down → (8,2)\n11. right → (8,3)\n12. right → (8,4)\n13. right → (8,5)\n14. right → (8,6)\n15. right → (8,7)\n16. right → (8,8)\n17. down → (9,8)\n18. down → (10,8)\n19. right → (10,9)\n20. right → (10,10)\n21. down → (11,10)\n22. down → (12,10)\n23. right → (12,11)\n24. right → (12,12)\n\nSo the directions list would be:\n\n['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right']\n\nBut let me verify each step.\n\nFrom (8,2) to (8,8) requires 6 'right's (steps 11-16). Then down twice (steps 17-18), then right twice (steps 19-20), then down twice (steps 21-22), then right twice (steps 23-24). Yes.\n\nNow, let me check if all those steps are valid.\n\nFor example, from (8,2) to (8,8): each step right is allowed, as row 8 allows movement from column 2 to 8.\n\nThen down to (9,8): row 9, column 8 is o.\n\nThen down to (10,8): row 10, column 8 is o.\n\nThen right to (10,9) and (10,10): allowed.\n\nThen down to (11,10): row 11, column 10 is o.\n\nThen down to (12,10): row 12, column 10 is o.\n\nThen right to (12,11) (o) and then to (12,12) (X). Correct.\n\nSo this path seems valid.\n\nNow, let me check if there are any errors in this path. For example, when moving from (4,2) down to (5,2), etc. Let me check row 5, column 2: yes, it's o.\n\nAnother possible error: when moving from (8,8) down to (9,8). Yes, row 9, column 8 is o.\n\nYes, seems okay.\n\nNow, the full path is:\n\n['right', 'right', followed by 8 'down's, then 6 'right's, then 2 'down's, 2 'right's, 2 'down's, 2 'right's].\n\nBut let me count the exact number of each step.\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n1. right\n2. right\n3. down\n4. down\n5. down\n6. down\n7. down\n8. down\n9. down\n10. down\n11. right\n12. right\n13. right\n14. right\n15. right\n16. right\n17. down\n18. down\n19. right\n20. right\n21. down\n22. down\n23. right\n24. right\n\nSo total of 24 steps. Let me check if the coordinates reach (12,12).\n\nLet me track the coordinates step by step:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nAfter step 1: (0,1)\n\nstep 2: (0,2)\n\nstep 3: (1,2)\n\nstep 4: (2,2)\n\nstep 5: (3,2)\n\nstep 6: (4,2)\n\nstep 7: (5,2)\n\nstep 8: (6,2)\n\nstep 9: (7,2)\n\nstep 10: (8,2)\n\nstep 11: (8,3)\n\nstep 12: (8,4)\n\nstep 13: (8,5)\n\nstep 14: (8,6)\n\nstep 15: (8,7)\n\nstep 16: (8,8)\n\nstep 17: (9,8)\n\nstep 18: (10,8)\n\nstep 19: (10,9)\n\nstep 20: (10,10)\n\nstep 21: (11,10)\n\nstep 22: (12,10)\n\nstep 23: (12,11)\n\nstep 24: (12,12)\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo this path is valid. Now, the problem is to output the list of directions. However, I need to make sure that there are no other obstacles along this path. For example, when moving from (8,2) to (8,8), each cell in between is passable. Let me check row 8: columns 2-8 are all o's. Yes. So that's okay.\n\nAnother check: from (10,8) to (10,10), columns 9 and 10 are o's. Yes, as per row 10's structure.\n\nAnother check: row 11, column 10 is o. Yes.\n\nSo this path is valid.\n\nNow, the final answer is to output this list as \"Answer: ['right','right', ... ]\".\n\nBut I need to write the exact sequence of moves as per the steps above.\n\nLet me write out the list:\n\n['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right']\n\nLet me count the number of 'down's and 'right's to ensure correctness.\n\nFirst two 'right's.\n\nThen eight 'down's (steps 3-10).\n\nThen six 'right's (steps 11-16).\n\nThen two 'down's (steps 17-18).\n\nThen two 'right's (steps 19-20).\n\nThen two 'down's (steps 21-22).\n\nThen two 'right's (steps 23-24).\n\nYes, that totals 2+8+6+2+2+2+2= 24 steps, which matches the earlier count.\n\nTherefore, this should be the correct path.\n ;Answer: ['right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right','right','right','down','down','right','right','down','down','right','right']"

    "response": [
      "Okay, let's try to solve this maze problem. First, I need to understand the maze structure. The user provided an 11x11 maze, with 'I' as the start and 'X' as the end. The other cells are either passable ('o') or walls ('*'). My task is to find a path from 'I' to 'X' using the allowed moves: up, down, left, right. The output should be a list of directions.\n\nFirst, I need to map out the maze. Let me write down the rows to visualize it better. Let me count the rows. The user provided 11 rows, each with 11 characters. Let me note the positions:\n\nRow 0: Ioooooooooo\nRow 1: o*o*o*o***o\nRow 2: o*o*o*ooo*o\nRow 3: **o*o*****o\nRow 4: ooo*ooo*ooo\nRow 5: **o*******o\nRow 6: ooooo*ooooo\nRow 7: o*o*******o\nRow 8: o*ooo*ooooo\nRow 9: **o*******o\nRow 10: ooooooo*ooX\n\nNow, the starting point is 'I' in row 0, column 0. The destination 'X' is in row 10, column 10. Let me note the coordinates. Since it's 0-based, I'll consider (row, column) positions.\n\nSo, the start is (0,0). The end is (10,10). Now, I need to find a path from there.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since it's a maze, perhaps a BFS (Breadth-First Search) approach would be best to find the shortest path. However, since I'm doing this manually, I need to simulate the process step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to trace the path step by step, avoiding walls and keeping track of visited positions to prevent loops.\n\nLet me start at (0,0). From there, possible moves. Let's look at the first row. The first row is I followed by 10 'o's. But since the next row (row 1) has a '*' in column 1, perhaps moving down isn't possible immediately? Wait, let me check the maze again.\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o o o o o. So, the starting position is (0,0). From here, possible directions are right (since moving down would be to row 1, column 0. Let me check row 1, column 0. Row 1's first character is 'o', so it's passable. So from (0,0), moving down to (1,0) is possible, or moving right to (0,1).\n\nBut perhaps moving right is blocked by walls in some directions. Let me try to sketch the path.\n\nLet me think of possible paths. Since the maze seems complex, maybe there's a way to go right first. But maybe going down is better. Let me try to outline possible paths.\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\nOption 1: Move right to (0,1). Then, perhaps continue right as far as possible. But looking at row 0, it's all 'o's. However, when moving down from row 0 to row 1, column 0 is 'o', so that's allowed. But maybe there's a better way. However, since the end is at (10,10), perhaps moving towards the bottom-right direction is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the path requires some backtracking. Let me try to plan step by step.\n\nLet me start by moving down first. From (0,0), moving down to (1,0). Now, in row 1, column 0 is 'o'. From here, possible moves: up (back to start), down (row 2, column 0: check row 2's first character. Row 2 starts with 'o', so yes. Let me check row 2, column 0 is 'o'. So moving down again to (2,0). Then again down to (3,0). But row 3, column 0 is '*', because row 3 starts with \"**o*o*****o\". So row 3, column 0 is '*', which is a wall. Therefore, can't move down from (2,0) to (3,0). So perhaps from (1,0), moving down to (2,0) is allowed, but then from (2,0) can't go down. So from (2,0), what directions can I take? Let's see:\n\nAt (2,0): can move up (back to (1,0)), or right. Let's try moving right. Row 2's first cell is 'o', then column 1 is '*', column 2 is 'o', etc. Wait, row 2 is \"o*o*o*ooo*o\". Let me parse each column for row 2:\n\nRow 2: columns 0 to 10:\n\n0: o\n1: *\n2: o\n3: *\n4: o\n5: *\n6: o\n7: o\n8: o\n9: *\n10: o\n\nSo, from (2,0), moving right to (2,1) is a wall. So can't. Therefore, from (2,0), moving right is blocked. So perhaps from (2,0), the only options are up or down (but down is blocked). So stuck? So maybe the path from (1,0) down isn't helpful. So perhaps moving right from the start is better.\n\nAlternative approach: Starting at (0,0), move right to (0,1). Then continue right as far as possible. Let's see. Row 0 is all 'o's except the first cell (which is 'I'). So (0,0) can go right to (0,1), then (0,2), all the way to (0,10)? Wait, but row 0 is \"Ioooooooooo\" which is 1 'I' followed by 10 'o's. So yes, row 0 has 11 cells. So from (0,0) moving right 10 times would take me to (0,10). But then, from there, can I move down? Let me check row 1, column 10. The first row is \"o*o*o*o***o\", so column 10 of row 1 is 'o'? Let me check:\n\nRow 1: \"o*o*o*o***o\". Let's split into columns. Let's count:\n\nColumns 0: o\n1: *\n2: o\n3: *\n4: o\n5: *\n6: o\n7: *\n8: *\n9: *\n10: o ?\n\nYes. So row 1, column 10 is 'o'. So if I'm at (0,10), moving down to (1,10) is allowed. Then from there, perhaps moving down again to (2,10). Let's check row 2, column 10. Row 2 is \"o*o*o*ooo*o\". Column 10 is 'o' again. So yes. Then (3,10): row 3's column 10 is 'o'? Row 3 is \"**o*o*****o\". Let's see:\n\nRow 3 columns:\n\n0: *\n1: *\n2: o\n3: *\n4: o\n5: *\n6: *\n7: *\n8: *\n9: *\n10: o ?\n\nYes. So (3,10) is 'o'. Continuing down to row 4, column 10. Row 4 is \"ooo*ooo*ooo\". Column 10 would be 'o'? Let me check. Let's split row 4:\n\nAssuming it's 11 columns. Let me think of the pattern. Let me count each column:\n\nRow 4: o o o * o o o * o o o ?\n\nSo columns 0-2: o's, column 3: *, columns 4-6: o's, column 7: *, columns 8-10: o's. So column 10 is 'o'. So yes. So from (4,10), moving down to row 5, column 10. But row 5 is \"**o*******o\". Let's check column 10. The row is **o followed by seven * and then o. Let me count:\n\nRow 5: columns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, then columns 3-9: *, and column 10: o. So yes, (5,10) is 'o'. So moving down from (4,10) to (5,10) is allowed. Then from (5,10), can I move down again to (6,10)? Let's check row 6, column 10. Row 6 is \"ooooo*ooooo\". Let's split. Assuming columns 0-4: o's, column 5: *, columns 6-9: o's, column 10: o. So yes, (6,10) is 'o'. Then down to (7,10). Row 7 is \"o*o*******o\". Column 10 is 'o'. Let's check: row 7 starts with o, then *, o, then seven * and o. So column 10 is o. So (7,10) is o. Then down to (8,10). Row 8 is \"o*ooo*ooooo\". Column 10 is o. Let me check: row 8's structure. Let me think, perhaps columns 0: o, 1: *, 2-5: o's, column 6: *, then columns 7-10: o's. So yes, (8,10) is o. Then down to (9,10). Row 9 is \"**o*******o\". Column 10 is o. Then down to (10,10), which is X. So that's the destination! Wait, so if I go all the way right along row 0 to (0,10), then all the way down to (10,10), that's a possible path?\n\nBut let me check if there are any walls in between. For example, when moving down from row 0 to row 10, column 10. Let me verify each step:\n\nFrom (0,10) down to (1,10): allowed. Then (2,10): allowed. (3,10): allowed. (4,10): allowed. (5,10): allowed. (6,10): allowed. (7,10): allowed. (8,10): allowed. (9,10): allowed. Then (10,10): X. But what about row 10's column 10? The last row is \"ooooooo*ooX\". Let's check. Let me count the characters. The row is 11 characters. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input: ooooooo*ooX. Let's count:\n\nAssuming:\n\nColumns 0-5: o's (6 o's?), then a *, then two o's, then X. Wait, let me recount. The row is written as \"ooooooo*ooX\". Let's count the o's before the *: 7 o's, then *, then two o's, then X. So total length is 7 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 11. So column 10 would be X. So yes, (10,10) is X. Therefore, this path would work. But is there any obstruction in between?\n\nWait, for example, row 5, column 10 is allowed. Let me check row 5: **o*******o. So column 10 is o. So yes. So this seems like a valid path. So the path would be:\n\nStart at (0,0). Move right 10 times to (0,10). Then move down 10 times to (10,10). But that would be a very long path. However, maybe there's a shorter path. But since the problem just requires any valid path, perhaps this is acceptable. However, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nBut let me check if this path is actually possible. For example, when moving right from (0,0) to (0,10), there are no walls. Then moving down each row. Let me check for each row if column 10 is passable.\n\nRow 0: yes (all o's except first cell).\n\nRow 1: column 10 is o (as discussed).\n\nRow 2: column 10 is o.\n\nRow 3: column 10 is o.\n\nRow 4: column 10 is o.\n\nRow 5: column 10 is o.\n\nRow 6: column 10 is o.\n\nRow 7: column 10 is o.\n\nRow 8: column 10 is o.\n\nRow 9: column 10 is o.\n\nRow 10: column 10 is X. So yes, this path works. But is there a shorter path? Let's think. Maybe there's a way to go diagonally or something. But since movement is only allowed in four directions, no diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other paths. For example, maybe there's a way to go down first, then right, avoiding some walls. But given that the rightmost column seems to be passable all the way down, this path is valid. So the answer would be moving right 10 times, then down 10 times. However, the problem requires the output as a list of directions. Let me calculate how many moves that would be. From (0,0) to (0,10): that's 10 right moves (since starting at column 0, moving to column 10 requires 10 steps). Then from (0,10) to (10,10): 10 down moves. Total of 20 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path that goes down and right in a more optimized way. Let's try to find another path.\n\nLet me consider the start at (0,0). Let me try to move down first. From (0,0) down to (1,0). Then right? Let's see. At (1,0), can I move right? Let me check row 1. Row 1 is o*o*o*o***o. So column 0 is o, column 1 is *, column 2 is o, etc. So from (1,0), moving right to (1,1) is blocked. So can't. So from (1,0), can move up (back to start) or right? But right is blocked. Or down to (2,0). Let's try that. From (1,0) down to (2,0). Now at (2,0). From there, can move up, down, or right. Let's try moving right. But row 2, column 0 is o. To move right, check column 1: it's * (as per row 2's structure). So can't. So from (2,0), can move up to (1,0), down to (3,0) if possible. But row 3, column 0 is * (as per row 3's first two columns are **). So can't move down. So stuck. So this path isn't helpful. So perhaps moving down from start isn't useful. Hence, going right first seems better.\n\nAnother idea: maybe there's a path that goes right, then down, then right again, navigating through the maze. Let me try to find such a path.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's move right to (0,1). Then perhaps down when possible. For example, maybe move right until a point where moving down is possible.\n\nBut let's think. For example, from (0,0) moving right to (0,1). Then down to (1,1) — but row 1, column 1 is * (wall). So can't. So need to move further right. Let's try moving to (0,2). From there, down to (1,2). Let's check row 1, column 2: since row 1 is o*o*o*o***o. Columns alternate o and * starting with o. So column 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, etc. So column 2 is o. Therefore, (1,2) is o. So moving down from (0,2) to (1,2) is allowed. Now at (1,2). From here, possible directions: up (back to (0,2)), left (to (1,1) which is *), down to (2,2). Let me check row 2, column 2: row 2 is o*o*o*ooo*o. Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o. So yes, (2,2) is o. So moving down to (2,2). Now at (2,2). From here, can move up, down, left, right. Let's try moving down again to (3,2). Row 3, column 2 is o? Row 3 is **o*o*****o. Columns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o. Yes. So (3,2) is o. Down to (3,2). From there, can I move down again? Row 4, column 2: let's check. Row 4 is ooo*ooo*ooo. Columns 0-2 are o's. So (4,2) is o. So yes. Down to (4,2). From there, perhaps continue down. Row 5, column 2: row 5 is **o*******o. Columns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o. So yes, (5,2) is o. Down to (5,2). Now, row 6, column 2: row 6 is ooooo*ooooo. Columns 0-5: o's except column 5 is *? Wait, row 6 is \"ooooo*ooooo\". Let me parse. Assuming columns 0-4: o, column 5: *, columns 6-10: o. So (6,2) is o. So down to (6,2). From there, perhaps move down again to (7,2). Row 7 is o*o*******o. Column 2 is o? Let me check. Row 7: column 0: o, 1: *, 2: o. Yes. So (7,2) is o. Down to (7,2). Next row 8, column 2: row 8 is o*ooo*ooooo. Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o. Yes. Down to (8,2). Row 9, column 2: row 9 is **o*******o. Columns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o. So yes, (9,2) is o. Down to (10,2). Now, at (10,2). But the destination is (10,10). From here, need to move right. Let me check what's in row 10 from column 2 to 10. Row 10 is \"ooooooo*ooX\". Let me parse it. Let's count the characters:\n\nAssuming the row is: columns 0-6: o's (7 o's?), then *, then o, o, X. Wait:\n\nOriginal input: \"ooooooo*ooX\". Let's count:\n\nColumns 0: o\n\n1: o\n\n2: o\n\n3: o\n\n4: o\n\n5: o\n\n6: o → 7 o's (columns 0-6). Then * at column 7. Then columns 8 and 9: o, o. Column 10: X. So yes. So from (10,2), which is o, can move right to columns 3, 4, etc., up to column 9 (o), then column 10 (X). So from (10,2), moving right 8 times to reach X. However, to get there, need to move up from (10,2) to (10,2) and then right. Wait, but this path requires moving down to (10,2) and then right. But how did we get to (10,2)? From (9,2) down. So this seems possible. Let's see:\n\nSo this path would be:\n\nStart → right to (0,2) → down to (1,2) → down to (2,2) → down to (3,2) → down to (4,2) → down to (5,2) → down to (6,2) → down to (7,2) → down to (8,2) → down to (9,2) → down to (10,2) → then right to (10,10). This is a valid path. Let's count the steps:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (0,2): 2 right moves.\n\nThen down 10 times (from row 0 to row 10, but starting at row 1, so 10 down moves? Wait, from (0,2) to (1,2): 1 down. Then to (2,2): another down. Total from row 0 to row 10 is 10 down moves (rows 0-10 is 11 rows, so 10 steps). So total down steps from (0,2) to (10,2) is 10 steps. Then from (10,2) to (10,10): 8 right steps. Total steps: 2 + 10 + 8 = 20 steps. Same as the previous path. But maybe there's a shorter path.\n\nBut let's check if this path is valid. For example, when moving down through column 2, are there any walls?\n\nLet me check each step:\n\n(0,2): valid.\n\nDown to (1,2): valid.\n\nDown to (2,2): valid.\n\nDown to (3,2): valid (row 3, column 2 is o).\n\nDown to (4,2): valid (row 4, column 2 is o).\n\nDown to (5,2): valid (row 5, column 2 is o).\n\nDown to (6,2): valid (row 6, column 2 is o).\n\nDown to (7,2): valid (row 7, column 2 is o).\n\nDown to (8,2): valid (row 8, column 2 is o).\n\nDown to (9,2): valid (row 9, column 2 is o).\n\nDown to (10,2): valid (row 10, column 2 is o).\n\nYes. Then from there, moving right 8 steps to (10,10). So this is valid. However, this is the same number of steps as the previous path. But perhaps there's a more optimal way.\n\nAnother idea: maybe there's a path that combines moving right and down in a way that reaches the destination faster. Let's try to find such a path.\n\nFor example, starting at (0,0), moving right to (0,1) is not helpful because down to (1,1) is a wall. Moving to (0,2), then down to (1,2), then perhaps right and down alternately.\n\nAt (1,2), maybe move right to (1,3)? But row 1, column 3 is * (as per row 1's pattern). Can't. So from (1,2), maybe move down again to (2,2), then right? Let me check.\n\nAt (2,2), can I move right? Let's see row 2: column 2 is o, column 3 is *, so no. So from (2,2), moving down to (3,2), then perhaps right?\n\nAt (3,2), can I move right? Row 3's column 2 is o. Column 3 is * (row 3 is **o*o*****o. Columns 0-1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, etc. So column 3 is *, so can't move right. So stuck again. So maybe this path isn't helpful. Hence, perhaps the only viable paths are the ones going all the way right or all the way down on certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to go through other columns. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLet me think of the previous two paths. Both take 20 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path. Let me think about the maze structure again. For example, perhaps there's a way to go through the middle.\n\nLet me try to find another path. Starting at (0,0). Let me move right to (0,1), then down to (1,1) — no, that's a wall. So no. Let me move right to (0,3). Let me think. From (0,0), moving right 3 steps to (0,3). Then down to (1,3), which is * (row 1's column 3 is *). Can't. So need to move further right. Let's try to move to (0,4). Down to (1,4), which is o? Row 1's column 4 is o (since the pattern alternates). Yes. So from (0,4), down to (1,4). Now at (1,4). From here, can move down to (2,4). Let me check row 2, column 4: row 2's columns alternate. Let me see: row 2 is o*o*o*ooo*o. Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o. Yes. So (2,4) is o. Down to there. Then perhaps move down again to (3,4). Row 3, column 4: row 3 is **o*o*****o. Columns 0-1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o. Yes. So (3,4) is o. Down to there. From (3,4), can I move down to (4,4)? Row 4's column 4: row 4 is ooo*ooo*ooo. Columns 0-2: o, 3: *, 4-6: o, 7: *, 8-10: o. So yes, (4,4) is o. Down to (4,4). Then down to (5,4). Row 5 is **o*******o. Columns 0-1: *, 2: o, then columns 3-9: *, column 10: o. So column 4 is *? Wait, row 5's column 4: since columns 3-9 are all *, yes. So (5,4) is * — wall. Can't move down. So stuck here. So need to find another way.\n\nFrom (4,4), perhaps move right? Let's see. Row 4, column 4 is o. Moving right to (4,5): row 4's column 5 is o? No, row 4 has a * at column 7, but columns 4-6 are o's. So column 5 is o. So yes. Moving right to (4,5). Then right to (4,6). From there, can I move down? Let me check row 5, column 6. Row 5's columns 3-9 are *, so column 6 is * — can't. So need to move further right. From (4,6), move right to (4,7). But row 4's column 7 is * — no. So stuck. Hence, perhaps from (4,4), move right to (4,6), but then can't proceed. So this path isn't helpful.\n\nAlternative idea: from (4,4), move up? Not helpful. Or left? Backtracking. Not helpful. So perhaps this path is not useful.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let me think about the earlier path where I went all the way right then down. That seems to work. Let me confirm again. From (0,0), move right to (0,10), then down to (10,10). Let me check if there are any walls in that column.\n\nAs previously checked, column 10 for each row from 0 to 10 is passable except for the start and end. So yes, that's valid. So that path works.\n\nAnother idea: maybe there's a shorter path by combining some right and down moves. For example, moving right a bit, then down, then right again, etc. Let me try to find such a path.\n\nStarting at (0,0), move right to (0, 5). Then down to (1,5), which is *? Let me check. Row 1's column 5 is *. Because row 1 alternates o and *, so columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *. Yes. So can't move down. So need to move further right to (0,6). Down to (1,6). Row 1, column 6 is o. Yes. So from (0,6), down to (1,6). Now at (1,6). From there, down to (2,6). Row 2, column 6 is o? Row 2's pattern is o*o*o*ooo*o. Let me check column 6: for row 2, columns alternate. Let me list them again:\n\nRow 2 columns:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: o\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: o\n\nYes. So (2,6) is o. Down to there. From (2,6), down to (3,6). Row 3, column 6: row 3 is **o*o*****o. Let's see columns:\n\nColumns 0-1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6-9: *, 10: o. So column 6 is *. Can't move down. So stuck. Need to move right or left.\n\nFrom (2,6), moving right to (2,7). Which is o. Then down to (3,7). Row 3, column 7 is * — no. Can't. So move further right to (2,8). Down to (3,8). Row 3, column 8 is * — no. So stuck again. Hence, this path might not work.\n\nAnother idea: from (2,6), move left to (2,5) which is *, can't. Left to (2,4) which is o. So from (2,6), move left to (2,5) is blocked, then to (2,4). Let me check. From (2,6), moving left to (2,5) is *, so can't. So move left to (2,4), which is o. So from (2,6), move left twice to (2,4). Then down to (3,4). Which is o. Yes. So from (2,4), down to (3,4). Now at (3,4). From there, down to (4,4). Which is o. Then down to (5,4) — which is * as before. So again stuck. Hmm.\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps the earlier paths are the best bet.\n\nLet me go back to the first idea of going all the way right then down. Let me confirm again that column 10 is clear.\n\nRow 0: (0,10) is o.\n\nRow 1: (1,10) is o.\n\nRow 2: (2,10) is o.\n\nRow 3: (3,10) is o.\n\nRow 4: (4,10) is o.\n\nRow 5: (5,10) is o.\n\nRow 6: (6,10) is o.\n\nRow 7: (7,10) is o.\n\nRow 8: (8,10) is o.\n\nRow 9: (9,10) is o.\n\nRow 10: (10,10) is X.\n\nYes, all clear. So the path is valid. So the directions would be:\n\nStart at (0,0). Move right 10 times to reach (0,10). Then move down 10 times to reach (10,10).\n\nSo the list of directions would be:\n\n['right'] * 10 + ['down'] * 10.\n\nLet me count the steps. From (0,0) to (0,10): 10 right moves. Then from (0,10) to (10,10): 10 down moves. Total of 20 steps.\n\nBut the problem says to output the list of directions. So the answer would be:\n\nAnswer: ['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']\n\nBut perhaps there's a shorter path. Let me think again. For example, maybe there's a way to go down earlier and save steps.\n\nLet me think of another path. For example, starting at (0,0), move right to (0,2), down to (1,2), then right to (1,3) is blocked. Down to (2,2), then right to (2,3) is blocked. Down to (3,2), then right to (3,3) is blocked. Down to (4,2), then right to (4,3) — let's check row 4, column 3 is * (row 4 is ooo*ooo*ooo). So column 3 is *, can't move. So move further right to (4,4), which is o. How to get there? From (4,2), move right to (4,3) is blocked, then to (4,4) allowed? No, because (4,3) is *, so can't move there. So need to move down first?\n\nNot sure. This seems complicated. Given the time I've spent and not finding a shorter path, perhaps the initial path is the easiest to implement.\n\nThus, the answer is to move right 10 times and down 10 times.\n\nBut let me check once more for any possible shortcuts. For example, in row 6, there's a clear path in the middle. Row 6 is \"ooooo*ooooo\". So column 5 is *, but columns 0-4 and 6-10 are o's. Perhaps there's a way to go through there.\n\nLet me try another approach. From the starting position, move down to (1,0), then right to (1,2), down to (2,2), right to (2,3) is blocked. Down to (3,2), then right to (3,4) (since row 3, column 4 is o). From (3,2), move down to (3,2) is already there. Wait, from (3,2), can I move right to column 3 (which is *), no. But column 4 is o. How to get there? Need to move down? No. So perhaps from (3,2), move down to (4,2), then right to (4,3) is *? No. Or move right to (3,4) requires passing through column 3 which is *.\n\nNot helpful. So again, no progress.\n\nAnother idea: Let me try to find the shortest path using BFS. Since I'm doing it manually, let's try to simulate.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's track visited positions.\n\nQueue: [(0,0)]\n\nVisited: {(0,0)}\n\nFrom (0,0), neighbors are:\n\nRight (0,1) — o, add to queue.\n\nDown (1,0) — o, add to queue.\n\nSo queue now has [(0,1), (1,0)].\n\nLet me explore these in order.\n\nFirst, (0,1). From here, neighbors:\n\nRight (0,2) — o.\n\nDown (1,1) — * (blocked).\n\nSo add (0,2) to queue. Visited adds (0,1).\n\nNext, (1,0). Neighbors:\n\nUp (0,0) — visited.\n\nDown (2,0) — o.\n\nRight (1,1) — blocked.\n\nSo add (2,0) to queue. Visited adds (1,0).\n\nNow queue is [(0,2), (2,0)].\n\nProcess (0,2). Neighbors:\n\nRight (0,3).\n\nDown (1,2) — o.\n\nAdd both. So queue becomes [(2,0), (0,3), (1,2)].\n\nVisited adds (0,2).\n\nProcess (2,0). Neighbors:\n\nUp (1,0) — visited.\n\nDown (3,0) — * blocked.\n\nRight (2,1) — * blocked.\n\nSo no new nodes. Queue now [(0,3), (1,2)].\n\nProcess (0,3). Right to (0,4). Down to (1,3) — *.\n\nAdd (0,4). Queue becomes [(1,2), (0,4)].\n\nVisited adds (0,3).\n\nProcess (1,2). Neighbors:\n\nUp (0,2) — visited.\n\nDown (2,2) — o.\n\nRight (1,3) — *.\n\nLeft (1,1) — *.\n\nAdd (2,2). Queue becomes [(0,4), (2,2)].\n\nVisited adds (1,2).\n\nProcess (0,4). Right to (0,5). Down to (1,4) — o.\n\nAdd (0,5) and (1,4). Queue: [(2,2), (0,5), (1,4)].\n\nVisited adds (0,4).\n\nProcess (2,2). Neighbors:\n\nUp (1,2) — visited.\n\nDown (3,2) — o.\n\nRight (2,3) — *.\n\nLeft (2,1) — *.\n\nAdd (3,2). Queue: [(0,5), (1,4), (3,2)].\n\nVisited adds (2,2).\n\nProcess (0,5). Right to (0,6). Down to (1,5) — *.\n\nAdd (0,6). Queue: [(1,4), (3,2), (0,6)].\n\nVisited adds (0,5).\n\nProcess (1,4). Up (0,4) — visited. Down (2,4) — o. Right (1,5) — *. Left (1,3) — *.\n\nAdd (2,4). Queue: [(3,2), (0,6), (2,4)].\n\nVisited adds (1,4).\n\nProcess (3,2). Up (2,2) — visited. Down (4,2) — o. Right (3,3) — *. Left (3,1) — *.\n\nAdd (4,2). Queue: [(0,6), (2,4), (4,2)].\n\nVisited adds (3,2).\n\nProcess (0,6). Right to (0,7). Down to (1,6) — o.\n\nAdd both. Queue: [(2,4), (4,2), (0,7), (1,6)].\n\nVisited adds (0,6).\n\nProcess (2,4). Up (1,4) — visited. Down (3,4) — o. Right (2,5) — *. Left (2,3) — *.\n\nAdd (3,4). Queue: [(4,2), (0,7), (1,6), (3,4)].\n\nVisited adds (2,4).\n\nProcess (4,2). Up (3,2) — visited. Down (5,2) — o. Right (4,3) — *.\n\nAdd (5,2). Queue: [(0,7), (1,6), (3,4), (5,2)].\n\nVisited adds (4,2).\n\nProcess (0,7). Down to (1,7) — * (row 1's column 7 is *). Right to (0,8).\n\nAdd (0,8). Queue: [(1,6), (3,4), (5,2), (0,8)].\n\nVisited adds (0,7).\n\nProcess (1,6). Up (0,6) — visited. Down (2,6) — o. Right (1,7) — *. Left (1,5) — *.\n\nAdd (2,6). Queue: [(3,4), (5,2), (0,8), (2,6)].\n\nVisited adds (1,6).\n\nProcess (3,4). Up (2,4) — visited. Down (4,4) — o. Right (3,5) — *. Left (3,3) — *.\n\nAdd (4,4). Queue: [(5,2), (0,8), (2,6), (4,4)].\n\nVisited adds (3,4).\n\nProcess (5,2). Up (4,2) — visited. Down (6,2) — o. Right (5,3) — *.\n\nAdd (6,2). Queue: [(0,8), (2,6), (4,4), (6,2)].\n\nVisited adds (5,2).\n\nProcess (0,8). Right to (0,9). Down to (1,8) — * (row 1's column 8 is *). \n\nAdd (0,9). Queue: [(2,6), (4,4), (6,2), (0,9)].\n\nVisited adds (0,8).\n\nProcess (2,6). Up (1,6) — visited. Down (3,6) — * (row 3's column 6 is *). Right (2,7) — o. Left (2,5) — *.\n\nAdd (2,7). Queue: [(4,4), (6,2), (0,9), (2,7)].\n\nVisited adds (2,6).\n\nProcess (4,4). Up (3,4) — visited. Down (5,4) — * (row 5's column 4 is *). Right (4,5) — o. Left (4,3) — *.\n\nAdd (4,5). Queue: [(6,2), (0,9), (2,7), (4,5)].\n\nVisited adds (4,4).\n\nProcess (6,2). Up (5,2) — visited. Down (7,2) — o. Right (6,3) — o.\n\nAdd (7,2) and (6,3). Queue: [(0,9), (2,7), (4,5), (7,2), (6,3)].\n\nVisited adds (6,2).\n\nProcess (0,9). Down to (1,9) — * (row 1's column 9 is *). Right to (0,10) — o.\n\nAdd (0,10). Queue: [(2,7), (4,5), (7,2), (6,3), (0,10)].\n\nVisited adds (0,9).\n\nNow, (0,10) is a new position. Let's check if this is part of the path towards the goal. From (0,10), we can move down through the column as previously discussed. So adding this to the queue is important.\n\nProcess (2,7). Up (1,7) — *, down (3,7) — *, right (2,8) — o. Left (2,6) — visited.\n\nAdd (2,8). Queue: [(4,5), (7,2), (6,3), (0,10), (2,8)].\n\nVisited adds (2,7).\n\nProcess (4,5). Up (3,5) — *, down (5,5) — *, right (4,6) — o. Left (4,4) — visited.\n\nAdd (4,6). Queue: [(7,2), (6,3), (0,10), (2,8), (4,6)].\n\nVisited adds (4,5).\n\nProcess (7,2). Up (6,2) — visited. Down (8,2) — o. Right (7,3) — *.\n\nAdd (8,2). Queue: [(6,3), (0,10), (2,8), (4,6), (8,2)].\n\nVisited adds (7,2).\n\nProcess (6,3). Up (5,3) — *, down (7,3) — *, right (6,4) — o. Left (6,2) — visited.\n\nAdd (6,4). Queue: [(0,10), (2,8), (4,6), (8,2), (6,4)].\n\nVisited adds (6,3).\n\nNow, the queue has (0,10), which is a key position. Let's process (0,10) next? No, the queue order depends on BFS. Let me see what's the current queue:\n\nAfter processing up to this point, the queue is:\n\n[(6,3), (0,10), ...] — no, earlier steps may have processed some. Let me recheck.\n\nActually, after processing (7,2), the queue is [(6,3), (0,10), (2,8), (4,6), (8,2)]. Next is processing (6,3), but let me check if (0,10) is in the queue. Yes, it's in the queue. Let me see when it gets processed.\n\nAssuming BFS processes in order, the next items after processing (7,2) would be (6,3), then (0,10), etc. So when (0,10) is processed, its neighbors are:\n\nUp (0,9) — visited.\n\nDown (1,10) — o.\n\nRight (0,11) — out of bounds.\n\nLeft (0,9) — visited.\n\nSo add (1,10) to the queue. This is an important step because from (1,10), we can continue down the column.\n\nSo when (0,10) is processed, we add (1,10). This is part of the path that goes all the way down. Continuing this BFS would eventually reach (10,10).\n\nTherefore, this confirms that there is a path through column 10, and BFS would find it. Since the BFS is finding the shortest path, and this path has 20 steps, it's likely that this is the shortest path available.\n\nThus, the answer is to move right 10 times and then down 10 times.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is a list of 10 'right's followed by 10 'down's.\n ;Answer: ['right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this 9x9 maze. The maze is given as a series of rows. Let me first try to visualize the maze properly. \n\nFirst, I'll note down the positions of 'I' and 'X'. The start 'I' is in the first row, first column (row 0, column 0 if we're 0-indexed). The destination 'X' is in the last row (row 8) and the last column (column 8). \n\nNow, let me write out the maze grid step by step. Each row is a string. Let me parse them:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o * o\nRow 1: o * * * * o * o\nRow 2: o o o o o * o o o\nRow 3: o * o * * * o * o\nRow 4: o * o o o * o * o\nRow 5: o * o * * * o * o\nRow 6: o * o * o * o * o\nRow 7: o * o * o * * * *\nRow 8: o * o o o o o o X\n\nWait, let me check each row again. Let me count the characters properly. Each row should have 9 characters. Let me re-express each row as a list for clarity:\n\nRow 0: ['I', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', '*', 'o']\nRow 1: ['o', '*', '*', '*', '*', 'o', '*', 'o', 'o']\nRow 2: ['o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', '*', 'o', 'o', 'o']\nRow 3: ['o', '*', 'o', '*', '*', '*', 'o', '*', 'o']\nRow 4: ['o', '*', 'o', 'o', 'o', '*', 'o', '*', 'o']\nRow 5: ['o', '*', 'o', '*', '*', '*', 'o', '*', 'o']\nRow 6: ['o', '*', 'o', '*', 'o', '*', 'o', '*', 'o']\nRow 7: ['o', '*', 'o', '*', 'o', '*', '*', '*', '*']\nRow 8: ['o', '*', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'X']\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (8,8). Let's think about possible paths. Since the maze is complex, I'll need to use some pathfinding algorithm. Since I'm doing this manually, maybe I can use BFS (Breadth-First Search) approach, keeping track of visited positions.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's consider possible moves. From the start, possible directions are right or down? Let's check:\n\nFrom (0,0), can move right to (0,1) since it's 'o'? Or down to (1,0), which is 'o'. Let me explore possible paths.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, maybe I can sketch the path step by step. Let's try to find a way.\n\nFirst, from (0,0), moving right is possible. Let me try moving right first. But perhaps there's a better way. Let me look for possible paths.\n\nLooking at row 0, the start is at (0,0). The cell (0,7) is a '*', so that's a wall. (0,8) is 'o'. So maybe the path goes through there? Let me think.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to go down first. Let's try.\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\nOption 1: Down to (1,0). Let's check if that's allowed. Row 1, column 0 is 'o', so yes. From (1,0), possible moves: can't go up (back to start), so check right or down. Let's see. (1,0) is in row 1. Let's look at row 1. The first cell is 'o', then columns 1-4 are '*', then column 5 is 'o', etc. So from (1,0), moving down to row 2, column 0? Row 2, column 0 is 'o', so yes. So moving down from (1,0) to (2,0). \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right from (1,0) is blocked because columns 1-4 are walls. So maybe moving down is better.\n\nLet me try to proceed step by step. Let's try to outline a possible path.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the path needs to go through certain corridors. Let me look for possible paths.\n\nLooking at the maze:\n\nRow 0: starts with I and several 'o's. The only wall in row 0 is at position 7 (the '*'). So from (0,0), moving right up to column 6 (index 6?), which is 'o', then column 7 is a wall. So maybe the path from (0,0) goes right to (0,6), but then can't proceed further right. So perhaps from there, move down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from (0,0) move down to (1,0), then right when possible.\n\nLet me try to imagine possible routes.\n\nAnother idea: since the destination is at (8,8), perhaps there's a path that snakes through the right side. Let me check row 8. The last row is o, *, o, then several o's leading to X. So in row 8, columns 0 is o, 1 is *, 2 is o, 3 is o, 4 is o, 5 is o, 6 is o, 7 is o, 8 is X. So to reach X, maybe the path comes from (8,7). To get to (8,7), perhaps from (7,7), but row 7 has a lot of *s. Let's check row 7: ['o', '*', 'o', '*', 'o', '*', '*', '*', '*'] — columns 0 is o, 1 is *, 2 is o, 3 is *, 4 is o, 5 is *, then columns 6-8 are *s. So from (7,4) which is o, maybe can move down to (8,4), then right to (8,7). Let me think.\n\nBut how to get to (7,4)? Let's think backwards. Maybe from row 6.\n\nLooking at row 6: ['o', '*', 'o', '*', 'o', '*', 'o', '*', 'o']. So positions (6,0), (6,2), (6,4), (6,6), (6,8) are o's. Let's see. For example, (6,8) is o. How to get there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path through the left side. Let me try to find a path step by step.\n\nLet me try starting with moving right from the start.\n\nStart at (0,0). Let's move right to (0,1). Then again right to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6). Now at (0,6). From here, can't move right (it's a wall). Can we move down? Let's check (1,6). Looking at row 1, column 6 is '*', which is a wall. So can't move down. What about moving down from (0,6) is blocked. So maybe from (0,6), need to move left? No, that would backtrack. Alternatively, perhaps from (0,6), move down to row 1, column 6 is blocked. So maybe this path is not working. So perhaps moving right all the way isn't helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: from start, move down first. Let's try:\n\n(0,0) → down to (1,0). Then down to (2,0). From (2,0), can we move right? Let's check row 2. The first few columns are o's up to column 5 (which is '*'). So from (2,0), moving right is possible. Let me see. Let's try to go as far right as possible in row 2. From (2,0), moving right to (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). Wait, (2,5) is '*', so can't go there. So up to (2,4). From (2,4), can we move down? Let's check (3,4). Row 3's column 4 is '*', so no. Can we move up? Back to row 1. Maybe move down to row 2, column 5 is blocked. So perhaps from (2,4), move left? Not helpful. Or maybe move down to row 3, column 4? But that's a wall. Hmm. So maybe this path is stuck. So perhaps need to backtrack and find another way.\n\nAlternative path: from (2,0), perhaps instead of moving all the way right, maybe move down again. Let me check. From (2,0), down to row 3, column 0. Row 3, column 0 is 'o', yes. So (3,0). From there, can we move right? Let's check row 3. Column 0 is o, column 1 is *, so can't move right there. So maybe move down again. From (3,0) down to (4,0). Row 4, column 0 is 'o'. From (4,0), can we move right? Let's check. Row 4, column 0 is o, column 1 is *, so can't move right. Down to (5,0)? Let's check row 5, column 0 is 'o'? Wait, row 5 is ['o', '*', ...], so yes. So (5,0). From there, again same problem. Maybe down to (6,0). From (6,0) is o. Then down to (7,0), which is o. Then down to (8,0), which is o. Now at (8,0). From there, need to get to (8,8). But row 8 has * at column 1. So from (8,0), can move right to (8,1)? No, because (8,1) is *. So stuck. So this path is not helpful. \n\nHmm. Maybe this approach isn't working. Let me think again. Perhaps I need to find a way to navigate through the maze's corridors. Let me look for possible paths.\n\nLooking at row 0, the start is at (0,0). From there, maybe move down to (1,0), then right when possible. Let me try again.\n\nAt (1,0), can we move right? Let's check. The row is [o, *, *, *, *, o, *, o, o]. So column 0 is o, column 1 is *, so can't move right there. So stuck. So maybe from (1,0), move down to (2,0). Then from (2,0), move right as much as possible. Let's try again.\n\nAt (2,0), moving right to (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). At (2,4), can we move down? Let's check (3,4). Row 3, column 4 is '*' (from earlier analysis). So no. What about moving up to row 1, column 4? Row 1, column 4 is '*'? Let me check row 1 again. Row 1: columns 0 is o, 1-4 are *, then column 5 is o. So yes, column 4 is *. So can't move up. So stuck again. So perhaps from (2,4), need to move left? No, that's backtracking. \n\nAlternative idea: perhaps from (2,0), instead of going all the way right, find a way to go down earlier. Let's see. From (2,0), down to (3,0). Then from (3,0), can we move right? No, column 1 is * (row 3's column 1 is *). So stuck. Down to (4,0). From (4,0), can move right? Column 1 is *, no. Down again to (5,0), same problem. Down to (6,0), same. Down to (7,0), then down to (8,0). As before, stuck. \n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different path. Let me check the starting position again. From (0,0), maybe move right once to (0,1), then down. Let's try that.\n\n(0,0) → right → (0,1). Now, can move down to (1,1). Let's check row 1, column 1 is *, which is a wall. So no. Can't move down. So maybe from (0,1), move right again to (0,2). Then down? Let's check (1,2). Row 1, column 2 is *, so no. Still blocked. Continue moving right. (0,3): down to (1,3) which is * (row 1, columns 1-4 are *). Still blocked. (0,4): down to (1,4) which is *? Yes. (0,5): down to (1,5). Row 1, column 5 is 'o'! Yes. So from (0,5), moving down to (1,5). \n\nSo path so far: right from (0,0) to (0,5) (that's 5 rights?), then down to (1,5). Let's track that. From (0,0) moving right 5 times: positions (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5). Then down to (1,5). \n\nNow at (1,5). Let's see. From here, can we move around. Let's check possible directions. \n\nLooking at row 1: (1,5) is o. To the right, (1,6) is *, then (1,7) is o, (1,8) is o. So from (1,5), can move right to (1,5+1=6?), but (1,6) is *, blocked. So can't. So maybe move down or up. \n\nUp would be row 0, column 5: which is o. But that's backtracking. Not helpful. So perhaps move down to row 2, column 5. But row 2, column 5 is * (from row 2's data: ['o','o','o','o','o','*', ... ]). So yes, (2,5) is a wall. Can't move there. So stuck again. \n\nHmm. So from (1,5), can we move left? Let's see. From (1,5), moving left to (1,4) is *, so no. Left to (1,3) is *, etc. So no. So maybe need to find another way. \n\nAlternative idea: from (1,5), move down to row 2, column 5 is blocked. But maybe there's another way. Let me check row 2. At (2,5) is *, but perhaps there's a way around. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, from (1,5), can we move right past the *? No. So maybe from (1,5), move down to row 2, column 5 is blocked. So perhaps need to find another path. \n\nLet me backtrack. Let me think again. From (0,5), down to (1,5) is possible. But stuck there. Maybe instead, from (0,5), move down to (1,5), then right? No. Maybe from (0,5), move right to (0,6). Which is allowed since row 0, column 6 is o. Then down to (1,6). But row 1, column 6 is * (from earlier data). So no. \n\nAlternatively, from (0,5), move right to (0,6), then down? No. So stuck. \n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different approach. Let me try to find where the 'I' can reach. Perhaps I need to look for a path that snakes through the maze. Let me try another route. \n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's move down to (1,0), then down to (2,0), then right to (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Now at (2,4). From here, can't move down. Let's try moving up to (1,4), which is *. No. So stuck. \n\nAlternative: from (2,4), move right? No, because (2,5) is *. \n\nHmm. Let me think of another path. What if from the start, I move right once, then down, then right again?\n\n(0,0) → right to (0,1). Down to (1,1) which is *, blocked. Not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: Let's check if there's a vertical passage on the left side. For example, columns 0 and maybe column 2. Let me look at column 0. \n\nColumn 0 has:\n\nRow 0: I (0,0)\n\nRow 1: o (1,0)\n\nRow 2: o (2,0)\n\nRow 3: o (3,0)\n\nRow 4: o (4,0)\n\nRow 5: o (5,0)\n\nRow 6: o (6,0)\n\nRow 7: o (7,0)\n\nRow 8: o (8,0)\n\nSo column 0 is all passable except for maybe some rows? Wait, looking back:\n\nRow 7's column 0 is o. Yes. So column 0 is a vertical passage all the way down. But as I tried earlier, going all the way down to row 8, column 0, but can't proceed right because row 8's column 1 is *.\n\nSo from (8,0), need to find a way to the right. How?\n\nLooking at row 8: from column 0 (o), column 1 is *, column 2 is o. So from (8,0), can't move right to (8,1), but can we move up? Let's check. From (8,0), up to (7,0). From there, can we move right? Row 7, column 0 is o. Moving right to (7,1) which is *, blocked. How about from (7,0), move up to (6,0)? Then again column 0. Not helpful. \n\nBut maybe there's a way from column 0 to column 2 in some rows. Let me check. For example, in row 3, column 0 is o, column 1 is *, column 2 is o. So from (3,0), can move right to (3,2)? Let me check row 3: columns [o, *, o, *...]. Yes, column 2 is o. So from (3,0) → right to (3,2). Then from there, can we move down or up?\n\nAt (3,2), looking at row 3, column 2 is o. Let's see what's around. From (3,2), down to (4,2). Row 4, column 2 is o. Yes. So moving down to (4,2). Then from there, can we move further?\n\nRow 4, column 2 is o. Let me check row 4. Columns 0 is o, 1 is *, 2 is o, 3 is o, 4 is o, 5 is *, etc. So from (4,2), can move right to (4,3), etc. \n\nThis seems promising. Let me try to map this path.\n\nStarting from (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → down to (3,0). Now at (3,0). Move right to (3,2). Then down to (4,2). Now at (4,2). Let's explore from here.\n\nAt (4,2), possible moves: right to (4,3), which is o. Let's go there. Then right to (4,4), which is o. Then from (4,4), can we move down? Let's check row 5, column 4. Row 5: columns [o, *, o, *, *, *, o, *, o]. So column 4 is *? Let me check. Row 5's columns 0 is o, 1 is *, 2 is o, 3 is *, 4 is *, 5 is *, 6 is o, etc. Yes, column 4 is *. So can't move down. What about moving up? From (4,4), up to (3,4). Let me check row 3, column 4. Earlier, I thought it was *, but let me recheck. Row 3: ['o', '*', 'o', '*', '*', '*', 'o', '*', 'o']. So columns 0-8. Column 4 is * (yes). So up is blocked. So from (4,4), can move right to (4,5)? No, because column 5 is *. So stuck. Hmm.\n\nAlternative: from (4,2), instead of moving right twice, maybe move down again. From (4,2) down to (5,2). Row 5, column 2 is o. Yes. Now at (5,2). From here, can move right? Let's check. Row 5, column 2 is o, column 3 is *, so can't. Can move down to (6,2). Row 6, column 2 is o. Now at (6,2). From here, can move right? Let's check. Row 6: columns 0 is o, 1 is *, 2 is o, 3 is *, 4 is o, etc. So from (6,2), can move right to (6,3)? No, it's *. So move down to (7,2). Row 7, column 2 is o. Now at (7,2). From here, can move right? Let's check. Row 7's column 2 is o, column 3 is *, so can't. Can move down to (8,2). Row 8, column 2 is o. Now at (8,2). From here, need to reach (8,8). Let's see. Row 8's columns 2 is o, columns 3-7 are o's (since row 8 is ['o', '*', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'X']). So from (8,2), can move right all the way to (8,7), then to (8,8) which is X. So this seems promising!\n\nLet me recap the path:\n\nStart at (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → down to (3,0) → right to (3,2) → down to (4,2) → down to (5,2) → down to (6,2) → down to (7,2) → down to (8,2) → then right to X.\n\nNow let's count the moves and translate them into directions.\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): down.\n\n(1,0) to (2,0): down.\n\n(2,0) to (3,0): down.\n\n(3,0) to (3,1): can't, since column 1 is *; wait, I need to move from (3,0) to (3,2)? How? Because between column 0 and 2 is column 1 which is *. So can't move directly right. Wait, this is a problem! Oh no, earlier I thought that from (3,0) you can move to (3,2), but there's a wall in between. That's a mistake. \n\nOh no! I made a mistake here. From (3,0), to get to column 2, you have to move right twice, but column 1 is a wall. So that's impossible. So this path is invalid. Oops! I need to correct this.\n\nSo how to get from (3,0) to somewhere else? Let me re-examine row 3. Row 3 is ['o', '*', 'o', '*', '*', '*', 'o', '*', 'o']. So column 0 is o, column 1 is *, column 2 is o. So from (3,0), you can't move directly to (3,2) because column 1 is a wall. So how to get there? You need to move up or down first? \n\nWait, maybe from (3,0), you can move down to (4,0), then right? Let me check. From (3,0) down to (4,0). Row 4, column 0 is o. From there, can move right? Let's check row 4. Row 4 is ['o', '*', 'o', 'o', 'o', '*', ...]. So column 0 is o, column 1 is *, column 2 is o. So from (4,0), can move right to (4,2)? But there's a wall in between. Again, same problem. So no. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. How can I get from column 0 to column 2 in row 3 or row 4? It seems like there's no way unless there's a vertical move. \n\nWait, maybe from (3,0), move up to row 2, column 0. From there, move right to (2,1), (2,2), etc. Let me think. \n\nFrom (3,0), up to (2,0). Then from (2,0), move right to (2,4) as before. But earlier that path got stuck. Let me try again. \n\nAt (2,0), moving right to (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). From (2,4), can we move down? Let's check row 3, column 4 is * (row 3's column 4 is *). Can't. What about moving up? No. Moving left? No. So stuck again. \n\nThis suggests that the earlier idea of getting to (3,2) from (3,0) is invalid. So need to find another way. \n\nLet me think again. Maybe there's another route. Let me look for other possible paths. \n\nLet me try starting from the beginning again. Let me consider moving right from the start, but not all the way. \n\nStart at (0,0). Move right to (0,1). Then down to (1,1) which is *, blocked. No good. \n\nMove right to (0,1), then down is blocked. How about move right to (0,1), then down is blocked, so move right to (0,2). From (0,2), down to (1,2) which is *? Yes, row 1, column 2 is *, blocked. Continue moving right. (0,3): down to (1,3) which is *, blocked. (0,4): down to (1,4) which is *, blocked. (0,5): down to (1,5) which is o. As before. So we're back to that point. \n\nAt (1,5), what can we do? From here, maybe move down to (2,5) which is * (row 2, column 5 is *). No. Move right to (1,6) which is *? No. Move left to (1,4) which is *? No. Move up to (0,5) which is o. Backtracking. Not helpful. \n\nAlternative idea: from (1,5), move down to (2,5) is blocked. What about moving down to row 2, column 5 is blocked, but perhaps there's a way around. Let me check row 2. Row 2 is ['o','o','o','o','o','*', 'o', 'o', 'o']. So column 5 is *, but columns 6,7,8 are o. So if I can get to (2,6), that would be good. How to get there from (1,5)? \n\nFrom (1,5), down to (2,5) is blocked. Can't move directly. But perhaps from (1,5), move right to (1,6) which is *, no. So no. How about from (1,5), move down to (2,5) is blocked. So no. \n\nWait, what if from (1,5), move down to (2,5) is blocked, but maybe there's a way to go around the wall in row 2. For example, from (2,4) (which is o), move right to (2,5) is blocked, but perhaps move down from (2,4) to (3,4) which is *? No. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe I need to find another path. Let me look for other possible starting moves. \n\nWhat if from (0,0), move down to (1,0), then right to (1,5) as before, but how? No, from (1,0), moving right is blocked until column 5. \n\nAlternatively, from (0,0), move down to (1,0), then down to (2,0), then right to (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Now at (2,4). From here, can I move down to (3,4)? Let me check. Row 3, column 4 is * (yes). Can't. What about moving up to (1,4) which is *? No. So stuck. \n\nWait, maybe from (2,4), move right to (2,5) is blocked. No. \n\nAnother idea: perhaps there's a path that goes up? No, because the start is at row 0, so can't move up. \n\nLet me try to look for another way. Let me check row 0's (0,8) which is o. From there, can I move down? Let me see. (0,8) is column 8. Row 1, column 8 is o. So from (0,8), down to (1,8). Let me see if I can reach (0,8) from the start. \n\nFrom (0,0), move right 8 times? Let me check row 0: positions 0-8. The only wall is at (0,7). So to reach (0,8), need to move right from (0,6) to (0,7) is blocked. So no. Can't go directly. \n\nBut maybe from (0,6), move down to (1,6) which is *? No. \n\nHmm. Maybe there's a way to go around the wall in row 0 at column 7 by going down. Let me think. \n\nFrom (0,6), move down to (1,6) which is *? Row 1, column 6 is * (yes). No good. \n\nAlternatively, from (0,6), move down to (1,6) is blocked, so no. \n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let me try to use BFS manually, keeping track of visited positions.\n\nStarting from (0,0). Let's mark visited positions as we go.\n\nInitial queue: [(0,0)]\n\nVisited: {(0,0)}\n\nFrom (0,0), possible moves: down to (1,0), right to (0,1).\n\nAdd these to the queue.\n\nQueue: [(1,0), (0,1)]\n\nVisited: {(0,0), (1,0), (0,1)}\n\nProcess (1,0). Possible moves: down to (2,0), right to (1,1) (which is *), up to (0,0) (visited). So add (2,0).\n\nQueue: [(0,1), (2,0)]\n\nVisited: add (2,0).\n\nProcess (0,1). Possible moves: right to (0,2), down to (1,1) (blocked). Add (0,2).\n\nQueue: [(2,0), (0,2)]\n\nVisited: add (0,2).\n\nProcess (2,0). Possible moves: down to (3,0), right to (2,1).\n\nAdd (3,0), (2,1).\n\nQueue: [(0,2), (3,0), (2,1)]\n\nVisited: add (3,0), (2,1).\n\nProcess (0,2). Right to (0,3), down to (1,2) (blocked).

Right to (8,8) which is X! Found the destination.\n\nNow, we need to backtrack from (8,8) to find the path. Let's reconstruct the path.\n\nThe path from (0,0) to (8,8) goes through the positions we visited in BFS. Let's see the steps:\n\nFrom the BFS, the last processed node before finding the destination is (8,7). Let's see how we got there.\n\n(8,7) was added because from (8,6), which was added from (8,5), from (8,4), from (8,3), from (8,2), which was added from (7,2), which was added from (6,2), which was added from (5,2), which was added from (4,2), which was added from (3,2), which was added from (2,3) or (2,2)? Let me try to trace back.\n\nLet me list the positions in the path:\n\nStarting from (8,7) → came from (8,6) → from (8,5) → from (8,4) → from (8,3) → from (8,2) → from (7,2) → from (6,2) → from (5,2) → from (4,2) → from (3,2) → from (2,3) or (2,2)? Let me see.\n\nLooking at how (4,2) was added: it was processed from (2,4)? No, earlier steps. Let me think about how each position was reached.\n\nThe path from (0,0) to (8,2):\n\n(0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → down to (3,0) → down to (4,0) → down to (5,0) → down to (6,0) → down to (7,0) → down to (8,0) → right to (8,2)? No, because from (8,0), you can't move right directly to (8,2) since (8,1) is *.\n\nWait, in the BFS, (8,2) was added from (7,2). (7,2) was added from (6,2). (6,2) was added from (5,2). (5,2) was added from (4,2). (4,2) was added from (3,2). (3,2) was added from (2,3)? Or (2,2)? Let me check how (3,2) was added.\n\nIn the BFS steps, (3,2) was added when processing (2,2) or (2,3)? Let me go back.\n\nWhen processing (2,2), possible moves: right to (2,3), down to (3,2). So (3,2) was added from (2,2) when processing (2,2). So the path to (3,2) is via (2,2). \n\nSo the path is:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (4,2) → (5,2) → (6,2) → (7,2) → (8,2) → (8,3) → (8,4) → (8,5) → (8,6) → (8,7) → (8,8).\n\nNow let's translate these coordinates into moves.\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): down.\n\n(1,0) to (2,0): down.\n\n(2,0) to (2,1): right.\n\n(2,1) to (2,2): right.\n\n(2,2) to (3,2): down.\n\n(3,2) to (4,2): down.\n\n(4,2) to (5,2): down.\n\n(5,2) to (6,2): down.\n\n(6,2) to (7,2): down.\n\n(7,2) to (8,2): down.\n\n(8,2) to (8,3): right.\n\n(8,3) to (8,4): right.\n\n(8,4) to (8,5): right.\n\n(8,5) to (8,6): right.\n\n(8,6) to (8,7): right.\n\n(8,7) to (8,8): right.\n\nNow, let's count the directions:\n\nDown, down, right, right, down, down, down, down, down, right, right, right, right, right, right.\n\nWait, let's count step by step:\n\n1. down\n2. down\n3. right\n4. right\n5. down\n6. down\n7. down\n8. down\n9. down\n10. right\n11. right\n12. right\n13. right\n14. right\n15. right\n\nWait, from (8,7) to (8,8) is the 15th move? Let me count the number of moves between coordinates:\n\nNumber of steps from start to end is 15 moves. Let me verify:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nMove 1: down → (1,0)\n\nMove 2: down → (2,0)\n\nMove 3: right → (2,1)\n\nMove 4: right → (2,2)\n\nMove 5: down → (3,2)\n\nMove 6: down → (4,2)\n\nMove 7: down → (5,2)\n\nMove 8: down → (6,2)\n\nMove 9: down → (7,2)\n\nMove 10: down → (8,2)\n\nMove 11: right → (8,3)\n\nMove 12: right → (8,4)\n\nMove 13: right → (8,5)\n\nMove 14: right → (8,6)\n\nMove 15: right → (8,7)\n\nMove 16: right → (8,8)?\n\nWait, no. From (8,7) to (8,8) is one move. So total of 15 moves? Let me recount:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): 1\n\n(1,0) to (2,0): 2\n\n(2,0) to (2,1): 3\n\n(2,1) to (2,2): 4\n\n(2,2) to (3,2): 5\n\n(3,2) to (4,2): 6\n\n(4,2) to (5,2): 7\n\n(5,2) to (6,2): 8\n\n(6,2) to (7,2): 9\n\n(7,2) to (8,2): 10\n\n(8,2) to (8,3): 11\n\n(8,3) to (8,4): 12\n\n(8,4) to (8,5): 13\n\n(8,5) to (8,6): 14\n\n(8,6) to (8,7): 15\n\n(8,7) to (8,8): 16\n\nSo total 16 moves. But the path from (0,0) to (8,8) requires 16 moves. Let me check if this path is valid.\n\nLet me verify each step:\n\nFrom (0,0) down to (1,0): valid.\n\n(1,0) down to (2,0): valid.\n\n(2,0) right to (2,1): valid (row 2, column 1 is o? Let me check row 2: ['o', 'o', ...]. Yes, all up to column 4 are o.\n\n(2,1) right to (2,2): valid.\n\n(2,2) down to (3,2): row 3, column 2 is o. Yes.\n\n(3,2) down to (4,2): row 4, column 2 is o. Yes.\n\n(4,2) down to (5,2): row 5, column 2 is o. Yes.\n\n(5,2) down to (6,2): row 6, column 2 is o. Yes.\n\n(6,2) down to (7,2): row 7, column 2 is o. Yes.\n\n(7,2) down to (8,2): row 8, column 2 is o. Yes.\n\nThen from (8,2) right to (8,3): valid, since row 8, column 3 is o.\n\nSimilarly, all the way to (8,8). Yes, this path is valid!\n\nSo the list of directions is:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nWait, let me count again:\n\nMove 1: down\n\nMove 2: down\n\nMove 3: right\n\nMove 4: right\n\nMove 5: down\n\nMove 6: down\n\nMove 7: down\n\nMove 8: down\n\nMove 9: down\n\nMove 10: down (from (7,2) to (8,2))\n\nThen six rights. So total of 10 + 6 = 16 moves.\n\nBut let me check the number of downs and rights:\n\nDowns: from move 1-2 (2), then move 5-10 (6 more), total 8 downs?\n\nWait:\n\nMoves 1: down\n\n2: down\n\n3: right\n\n4: right\n\n5: down\n\n6: down\n\n7: down\n\n8: down\n\n9: down\n\n10: down\n\nThat's 8 downs (moves 1,2,5,6,7,8,9,10: total 8). Then 6 rights (moves 11-16). Total 14 moves? No, wait, 10 moves to get to (8,2), then 6 rights (from (8,2) to (8,8) is 6 moves: 8,3; 8,4; 8,5; 8,6; 8,7; 8,8. So 6 moves. Total of 10 + 6 = 16 moves.\n\nSo the list of directions is:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nNow, converting this into the required format, the answer is a list of these strings.\n\nLet me double-check each step to ensure there are no errors. For example, from (2,2) down to (3,2): yes. From (3,2) down to (4,2): yes. And so on. All steps are valid. \n\nYes, this seems correct.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this maze. So the user provided an n x n maze, and I need to find a path from 'I' (start) to 'X' (destination). The maze has 'o's as passable paths and '*' as walls. The output should be a list of moves: up, down, left, right.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the maze. Let me write it out properly. The input is given as lines:\n\nLine 0: Ioooooooo\nLine 1: o*o*o*o*o\nLine 2: o*o*o*o*o\nLine 3: o***o***o\nLine 4: ooo*ooo*o\nLine 5: o***o*o*o\nLine 6: ooo*o*o*o\nLine 7: **o*****o\nLine 8: ooo*ooooX\n\nAssuming each line is a row, so the maze is 9x9. Let me map the coordinates. Let's consider rows as y-axis and columns as x-axis. But sometimes, depending on how you model it, it might be easier to think in terms of (row, column) as (y, x). Let me try to find the starting position first.\n\nThe first line is \"Ioooooooo\". So position (0,0) is 'I'. The destination is at the end of the last line: line 8 ends with \"ooooX\", so looking at that line, let's count the characters. Let's see: line 8 is \"ooo*ooooX\". Let's index columns from 0 to 8. The X is at the end, so position (8,8) is X.\n\nSo start is (0,0), end is (8,8). Now I need to find a path from there.\n\nLet me think of possible algorithms. Since it's a maze, BFS (Breadth-First Search) is a good approach to find the shortest path. But since I need to output the list of moves, I need to track the path taken. Alternatively, I can simulate the steps, keeping track of visited positions to avoid loops.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, let me try to trace the path step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). From there, possible moves: right or down? Let's check.\n\nLooking at row 0: \"Ioooooooo\" which is row 0. So the starting cell is (0,0). The cell to the right (0,1) is 'o', passable. Down is (1,0), which is 'o' as per row 1: first character is 'o'.\n\nSo possible directions from start: right or down. Let me think which path leads to the destination.\n\nLet me try to map the maze:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o o o\nRow 1: o * o * o * o * o\nRow 2: o * o * o * o * o\nRow 3: o * * * o * * * o\nRow 4: o o o * o o o * o\nRow 5: o * * * o * o * o\nRow 6: o o o * o * o * o\nRow 7: * * o * * * * * o\nRow 8: o o o * o o o o X\n\nWait, row 8's line is \"ooo*ooooX\". Let me check again. Let's index each row:\n\nRow 0: positions 0-8: [I, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o]\n\nRow 1: o * o * o * o * o → positions 0 is o, 1 is *, 2 is o, etc.\n\nSame for row 2.\n\nSo let me try to sketch the maze mentally.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's try to move down first. Let's see:\n\nFrom (0,0), moving down to (1,0). Then, what's possible from there?\n\nRow 1, column 0 is o. Now, possible moves: up (back to start?), down to (2,0) which is o. Let's check row 2, column 0 is o. Then, perhaps continue down?\n\nBut looking at row 1 and 2, they have patterns of o*o*o*o*o. So in row 1, columns alternate between o and *, starting with o. Similarly for row 2.\n\nIf I go down from (1,0) to (2,0), then perhaps continue down again. Let's check row 3, column 0. Row 3 starts with o, then ***, etc. So row 3, column 0 is o. So moving down again to (3,0). Then down to (4,0), which is o (row 4 starts with o o o...). Then down to (5,0): row 5, column 0 is o? Let me check row 5's line: \"o***o*o*o\". So first character is o. Yes. So moving down to (5,0). Then down to (6,0): row 6, column 0 is o (row 6 is \"ooo*o*o*o\"). Then down to (7,0): row 7 starts with **, so (7,0) is *, which is a wall. So can't go down there. So from (6,0), can't go further down. So perhaps this path hits a dead end?\n\nSo going straight down from start leads to (6,0), and then can't proceed. So maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternative approach: from start (0,0), move right. Let's try that.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Move right to (0,1). From there, possible moves. Let's see:\n\nLooking at row 0: all o's except the start (which is I, but treated as o once we're there). So from (0,1), can move left back, right further, or down?\n\nBut since we need to find a path, perhaps down?\n\nBut row 1, column 1 is *, which is a wall. So if we are at (0,1), moving down would take us to (1,1), which is * (impassable). So that's not allowed. So from (0,1), can't move down. So possible directions: right or up (but up is outside the maze). So only right. So move right again to (0,2). Now, from (0,2), same situation. Moving down to (1,2) which is o (since row 1: columns alternate o, *, o, *, etc. So column 2 is o. So yes, can move down here.\n\nSo from (0,2), move down to (1,2). Now at (1,2). From here, possible directions. Let's check:\n\nCurrent position (1,2). What's around?\n\nUp: (0,2) which is o (passable, already visited?).\n\nDown: row 2, column 2 is o.\n\nLeft: (1,1) is * (wall).\n\nRight: (1,3) is * (wall).\n\nSo possible moves: up or down. Since we came from up (we moved down from (0,2) to here), perhaps go down again to (2,2). Let's do that.\n\nNow at (2,2). From here:\n\nUp: (1,2) which is passable.\n\nDown: row 3, column 2. Row 3 is \"o***o***o\". Column 0 is o, columns 1-3 are ***, then column 4 is o, etc. So column 2 is * (since 0 is o, 1 is *, 2 is *, 3 is *). So (3,2) is *, can't go down. So possible directions: up, left, or right?\n\nLeft: (2,1) is * (wall). Right: (2,3) is * (since row 2's pattern is same as row 1: o*o*o*o*o. Column 3 is *). So can't move left or right. So only up or down. But down is blocked. So can only move up to (1,2). But that's where we came from. So stuck here? That's a problem.\n\nHmm, so maybe this path is a dead end. Let me backtrack. So when I was at (1,2), instead of moving down again, maybe move up back to (0,2), then proceed right again?\n\nLet me retrace. From (1,2), if I move up to (0,2), then move right to (0,3). From (0,3), can I move down? Let's check. (0,3) is in row 0, column 3. Moving down to (1,3) which is * (wall). So no. So again, same problem. So moving right along row 0 until a position where moving down is possible.\n\nLet me think. For row 0, moving right until column x where x is even? Because in row 1, columns alternate o and * starting with o. So for even columns (0, 2, 4, etc.), row 1 has o. For odd columns, it's *.\n\nSo maybe the way to proceed is to get to (0, 4), then down to (1,4), which is o. Let's try that.\n\nStarting again from (0,0). Move right to (0,1), right to (0,2), right to (0,3), right to (0,4). Now, from (0,4), move down to (1,4). Which is o. Now at (1,4). Let's check the surroundings.\n\nCurrent position (1,4). What's around?\n\nUp: (0,4) is o.\n\nDown: row 2, column 4 is o (row 2's pattern is same as row 1: o*o*o*o*o. Column 4 is o).\n\nLeft: (1,3) is * (wall).\n\nRight: (1,5) is * (wall).\n\nSo possible moves: up, down. Since came from up, perhaps go down to (2,4).\n\nAt (2,4). Now, check surroundings:\n\nUp: (1,4).\n\nDown: row 3, column 4. Row 3 is \"o***o***o\". Columns 0 is o, columns 1-3 are ***, column 4 is o. So yes, (3,4) is o. So can move down here.\n\nSo moving down to (3,4). Now at (3,4).\n\nLooking around:\n\nUp: (2,4).\n\nDown: row 4, column 4. Row 4 is \"ooo*ooo*o\". Let's parse that. Columns 0-2: ooo, column 3 is *, columns 4-6: ooo, column 7 is *, column 8 is o. So (4,4) is o. So can move down to (4,4).\n\nNow at (4,4). From here:\n\nCheck surroundings. Let's see:\n\nUp: (3,4).\n\nDown: row 5, column 4. Row 5 is \"o***o*o*o\". Columns 0 is o, 1-3 are ***, column 4 is o, column 5 is *, column 6 is o, column 7 is *, column 8 is o. So (5,4) is o. So can move down.\n\nMoving down to (5,4). Now at (5,4). Let's check surroundings.\n\nLooking around:\n\nUp: (4,4).\n\nDown: row 6, column 4. Row 6 is \"ooo*o*o*o\". Columns 0-2: ooo, column 3 is *, column 4 is o, column 5 is *, column 6 is o, column 7 is *, column 8 is o. So (6,4) is o. Can move down.\n\nSo moving down to (6,4). Now at (6,4).\n\nFrom here:\n\nUp: (5,4).\n\nDown: row 7, column 4. Row 7 is \"**o*****o\". Let's parse columns:\n\nRow 7: columns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o. So (7,4) is * (wall). Can't move down.\n\nSo possible directions: up, left, right?\n\nCurrent position (6,4). Let's check left and right.\n\nLeft: (6,3) is * (row 6, column 3 is *). Right: (6,5) is * (row 6 column 5 is *). So only up is possible. Moving up back to (5,4). Which we already came from. So stuck again?\n\nHmm. Let me think. So from (5,4), what other options are there? Let's check.\n\nAt (5,4), possible directions:\n\nLeft: (5,3)? Let me check. Row 5, column 3: since row 5 is \"o***o*o*o\", columns 0 is o, then columns 1-3 are ***, then column 4 is o. So column 3 is *, so (5,3) is * (wall). Can't move left.\n\nRight: (5,5) is * (row 5 column 5 is *). So can't move right. Up: (4,4). Down: (6,4). So only up or down. But both lead back. So stuck here?\n\nThis suggests that this path is also a dead end. Let me backtrack.\n\nSo, going back to (4,4). From there, perhaps moving right or left instead of down?\n\nAt (4,4), what's possible? Let's check.\n\nCurrent position (4,4). Let's see:\n\nLeft: (4,3) is * (row 4 column 3 is *). Can't move left.\n\nRight: (4,5) is o? Row 4 is \"ooo*ooo*o\". Columns 4-6 are ooo. So column 5 is o. Yes. So (4,5) is o. So can move right to (4,5). Let's try that.\n\nMoving right to (4,5). Now at (4,5). From here:\n\nCheck surroundings. Up, down, left, right.\n\nUp: (3,5). Row 3: columns 0 is o, then ***, column 4 is o, then ***. Let me check row 3's columns. Row 3 is o***o***o. Columns 0: o, 1-3: ***, 4: o, 5-7: ***, 8: o. So (3,5) is * (wall). Can't move up.\n\nDown: (5,5). Row 5 column 5 is * (from earlier analysis). So can't move down.\n\nLeft: (4,4), where we came from.\n\nRight: (4,6) is o (row 4 column 6 is o). So move right to (4,6).\n\nNow at (4,6). Let's check.\n\nUp: (3,6) is * (row 3 column 6 is part of the *** after column 4). So can't move up.\n\nDown: (5,6) is o? Row 5 column 6: from earlier, row 5 is o***o*o*o. Column 4 is o, column 5 is *, column 6 is o. Yes. So (5,6) is o. So move down to (5,6).\n\nNow at (5,6). Let's check surroundings.\n\nUp: (4,6).\n\nDown: (6,6). Row 6 column 6 is o (row 6: columns 0-2 ooo, column 3 *, column 4 o, column 5 *, column 6 o, etc.). Yes. So can move down to (6,6).\n\nNow at (6,6). From here:\n\nUp: (5,6).\n\nDown: (7,6). Row 7 column 6: row 7 is \"**o*****o\". Columns 0-1: **, column 2: o, column 3: *, columns 4-7: *****, column 8: o. So column 6 is * (since columns 4-7 are ****, starting from column 4: *, column 5: *, column 6: *, column 7: *). So (7,6) is *, can't move down.\n\nPossible directions: left, right?\n\nLeft: (6,5) is * (row 6 column 5 is *). Right: (6,7) is * (row 6 column 7 is *). So only up. Moving up to (5,6). Which is where we came from. Stuck again?\n\nHmm. Let's backtrack. From (6,6), maybe other options? No, seems stuck. Let's go back to (5,6). From there, perhaps other directions?\n\nAt (5,6), can we move right? (5,7) is * (row 5 column 7 is *). Left? (5,5) is * (wall). Up? (4,6) is o. Down? (6,6) as before. So no. So backtrack further.\n\nBack to (4,6). From there, we moved down to (5,6). What else can we do from (4,6)? Let's check.\n\nAt (4,6), can we move right? (4,7) is * (row 4 column 7 is *). So no. So perhaps move up? But (3,6) is * (wall). So no. Left back to (4,5). So backtracking again.\n\nBack to (4,5). From there, we moved right to (4,6). Any other options? Let's check.\n\nAt (4,5), can we move down? (5,5) is * (wall). Up? (3,5) is * (wall). Left? (4,4). So no. So backtracking again to (4,4).\n\nSo from (4,4), moving right led us to a dead end. Let's check if there are other directions. From (4,4), can we move down to (5,4) as before, but that path also led to dead end. What about moving up?\n\nAt (4,4), came from (3,4). Moving up to (3,4) again. Let me think. From (3,4), what options are there?\n\nAt (3,4), which is row 3 column 4. Let's check possible directions.\n\nUp: (2,4) is o.\n\nDown: (4,4) is o.\n\nLeft: (3,3) is * (row 3's column 3 is *).\n\nRight: (3,5) is * (row 3's columns after 4 are ***o, so column 5 is *). So from (3,4), possible to move up or down. Since we came from up (from (2,4)), perhaps move down again to (4,4), but that's where we just came from. Not helpful. So maybe backtrack further.\n\nBack to (3,4) came from (2,4), which came from (1,4), which came from (0,4). So perhaps need to find another way from earlier steps.\n\nLet me think. Maybe the initial approach of moving down from the start isn't working. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternative path: Starting at (0,0). Let's try moving right to (0,1), then down? Wait, earlier tried that but (1,1) is *.\n\nNo. So maybe from (0,0), move right to (0,2), then down to (1,2). But that path led to a dead end. But perhaps from (1,2), instead of going down to (2,2), go right?\n\nWait, at (1,2), can we move right? Let's check. (1,2) is in row 1, column 2. Moving right to (1,3) which is * (wall). No. So no. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe go right further along row 0 to a column where moving down is possible. For example, column 4, as before. But that path led to a dead end. Maybe there's another way.\n\nLet me try to find another route. Let's think of the entire maze. The destination is at (8,8). Let me see if there's a way to reach there.\n\nLooking at row 8: the last row is o o o * o o o o X. So column 8 is X. To get there, need to reach (8,7) and move right. But row 8, column 7 is *? Let me check again. The line is \"ooo*ooooX\". Let's index columns 0-8:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: o, 8: X. Wait, column 7 is o, column 8 is X. So to reach X, need to be at (8,8). To get there, from (8,7) moving right. But (8,7) is o. How to get there?\n\nLooking at row 8, column 7 is o. To reach there, need to come from above, since row 8 is the bottom row. So from (7,7) moving down. But row 7, column 7 is * (from row 7: \"**o*****o\" → columns 0-1: *, 2: o, 3: *, columns 4-7: * * * *, column 8: o. So (7,7) is * (wall). Can't come from there. So maybe from the left? (8,6) moving right. Let's check row 8, column 6 is o. So yes. So from (8,6) move right to (8,7), then right to (8,8). But how to get to (8,6)?\n\nLooking at row 8, column 6 is o. To reach there, from above: row 7, column 6. But row 7 column 6 is * (as discussed). So perhaps from the left? Or from above?\n\nLooking at row 7, column 6 is *, so can't come from there. How about row 6, column 6? Yes. Row 6 column 6 is o. From there, can we move down to (7,6)? No, because (7,6) is *.\n\nSo from (6,6), can't go down. But maybe from (6,6), move right? Let's check. (6,6) is column 6. Moving right to (6,7): row 6 column 7 is * (row 6: ... column 7 is *). No. So can't. Left to (6,5): which is * (row 6 column 5 is *). So no. Up to (5,6): which we've tried before.\n\nSo maybe need to find a way to reach (6,6) from somewhere else.\n\nLet me think about how to get to (6,6). Let's see. For example, from (5,6), which is o, moving down to (6,6). How to get to (5,6)?\n\nEarlier steps showed that (5,6) is reachable from (4,6), which is reachable from (4,5) etc. But then from (5,6), we can move down to (6,6). From there, perhaps move right? No. Or maybe move up again? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,6), perhaps move left? But (6,5) is *.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another path to (6,6). Let me think.\n\nLet me try to find another way to reach (6,6). For example, from row 4 or 5.\n\nLet me try to backtrack further. Let's think of another approach.\n\nStarting again. From the start (0,0), perhaps move down to (1,0), then right? Let's try.\n\nStart at (0,0). Move down to (1,0). Now at (1,0). Possible directions: up (back), down to (2,0), or right to (1,1) (which is *). So can't move right. So down to (2,0). Now at (2,0). From here, down to (3,0). Now at (3,0). Down to (4,0). Now at (4,0). Down to (5,0). Now at (5,0). Down to (6,0). Now at (6,0). Down to (7,0) which is * (row 7, column 0 is *). Can't. So from (6,0), possible directions: up, right?\n\nLet me check (6,0). Up is (5,0). Right: (6,1). Row 6, column 1: row 6 is \"ooo*o*o*o\". Columns 0-2 are ooo. So column 1 is o. So can move right to (6,1). Now at (6,1). From here, can move right again to (6,2) which is o. Now at (6,2). From here, check if can move down? Row 7, column 2: row 7 is \"**o*****o\". Column 2 is o. So yes! Moving down to (7,2). Now at (7,2). From here, can move down to (8,2). Let's check row 8, column 2: o. Yes. Now at (8,2). From here, need to get to (8,8). Let's see. Current position is (8,2). Need to move right through columns 3-8, but row 8 has a * at column 3. Let's check:\n\nRow 8 is columns 0-8:\n\n0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: o, 8: X.\n\nSo from (8,2), can move right to (8,3)? No, because it's *. So need to find a way around. Let's see. From (8,2), can we move up to (7,2) again? Yes, but how to proceed from there.\n\nAt (7,2), which is o. Let's look around. From here, possible directions: up to (6,2), down is (8,2), left is (7,1) which is * (row 7 column 1 is *). Right is (7,3) which is * (row 7 column 3 is *). So only up or down. So stuck unless there's another way.\n\nHmm. So this path leads to (8,2), which is a dead end. Let me backtrack.\n\nFrom (6,2), instead of moving down, what else can I do? From (6,2), can move right to (6,3) which is * (row 6 column 3 is *). No. So no. Or move up to (5,2). Let's try that.\n\nAt (6,2), move up to (5,2). Now at (5,2). Let's check surroundings. Row 5 is \"o***o*o*o\". Columns 0 is o, then columns 1-3 are ***, column 4 is o, column 5 is *, column 6 is o, column 7 is *, column 8 is o. So (5,2) is *? Wait, column 2 is part of columns 1-3 which are ***, so yes. So (5,2) is *? Wait, row 5, column 0 is o, column 1 is *, column 2 is *, column 3 is *, column 4 is o. So yes, (5,2) is * (wall). Can't move there. So that's invalid. So my mistake: when moving up from (6,2) to (5,2), that's a wall. So invalid move. So that's not possible. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, how did I get to (6,2)? From (6,1) moving right to (6,2). Then trying to move up to (5,2) is into a wall. So that's not allowed. So what other options are there from (6,2)? Only down (already tried) and left? (6,1). So stuck. Backtrack again.\n\nBack to (6,1). From there, moved right to (6,2). What else? Can move right to (6,2) is blocked. Can move up to (5,1). Let's try that. (5,1) is * (row 5 column 1 is *). No good. Can't move up. So only options are left (back to (6,0)) or down to (7,1) which is * (row 7 column 1 is *). So no. So stuck. Backtrack further.\n\nBack to (6,0). From there, moved right to (6,1). What else? Can move up to (5,0). Let's try that. At (5,0). From there, can move up to (4,0), down to (6,0), or right to (5,1) which is *.\n\nSo let's go up to (4,0). Now at (4,0). From here, possible directions: up to (3,0), down to (5,0), or right to (4,1) which is o (row 4 is \"ooo*ooo*o\", so columns 0-2 are ooo). So move right to (4,1). Now at (4,1). From here, can move right to (4,2) which is o. Now at (4,2). From here, check if can move down? Row 5, column 2 is * (as before). Can't. So move right again to (4,3). But row 4 column 3 is * (row 4's column 3 is *). Can't. So back to (4,2). Move up to (3,2) which is * (row 3 column 2 is *). Can't. So stuck. Hmm.\n\nThis path isn't working. Let me think of another approach. Maybe there's a way through the middle of the maze.\n\nLet me try to look for possible paths from earlier steps. For example, when I was at (4,4), I tried going right and got stuck. What if from (4,4), I go left? But (4,3) is *.\n\nNo. So no. What about from (3,4), which is in row 3 column 4. From there, can I move right? (3,5) is *, no. Left? (3,3) is *, no. So only up and down.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's try to use BFS mentally. Starting from (0,0), and mark visited positions.\n\nBut doing this manually is error-prone. Let me try to think of the maze again.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's see if there's a path that goes through row 4, column 4 to row 6, column 4, then finds a way around.\n\nWait, earlier from (6,4), I was stuck. But perhaps from there, move right? Let me check (6,4). Row 6 column 4 is o. Moving right to (6,5) is * (row 6 column 5 is *). No. Left to (6,3) is * (row 6 column 3 is *). So no. Up to (5,4), which is o. So from (5,4), what about moving right? Let me check (5,4). Can I move right to (5,5)? It's *, no. Left to (5,3) is *, no. Up to (4,4), which is o. Down to (6,4), which is o. So stuck again.\n\nHmm. Let me try to look for other paths. What about from (0,0), moving right to (0,4), down to (1,4), down to (2,4), down to (3,4), down to (4,4), then left? No, can't. Or maybe from (4,4), move right to (4,5), then down to (5,6), as before, then down to (6,6), then what? From (6,6), can we move right? (6,7) is * (row 6 column 7 is *). Left to (6,5) is *. Up to (5,6). So no. But from (6,6), maybe move up to (5,6), then right to (5,7) is *? No. Or from (5,6), move down to (6,6) again. Not helpful.\n\nWait, from (5,6), which is o, what about moving up to (4,6), then left to (4,5), then up to (3,5)? No, (3,5) is *.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's look at row 6. Row 6 is ooo*o*o*o. So columns 0-2 are o, column 3 is *, column 4 is o, column 5 is *, column 6 is o, column 7 is *, column 8 is o. So from (6,6), which is o, can we move down? No. What about from (6,6), move right to (6,7) is *, no. Move left to (6,5) is *, no. So only up. From (6,6), up to (5,6). From there, perhaps move left to (5,4)? No, because (5,5) is *, and (5,4) is o. But to get from (5,6) to (5,4), need to move left through (5,5) which is *.\n\nNo. So stuck.\n\nMaybe there's a different path entirely. Let me try to find a way through the lower part of the maze.\n\nLet me think about row 7. It's **o*****o. So column 2 is o, and column 8 is o. From (7,2), can I move down to row 8? No, because it's the last row. But from (7,2), can I move right? Let's see: (7,3) is *, (7,4) is *, etc. So no. From (7,2), only up to (6,2) or down to (8,2). Both are o. But (8,2) is a dead end as discussed.\n\nLet me think of row 4. Row 4 is \"ooo*ooo*o\". So columns 0-2: o, column 3: *, columns 4-6: ooo, column 7: *, column 8: o. So from (4,6), we can move down to (5,6), then down to (6,6), as before. But stuck.\n\nWhat about from (4,6), move right to (4,7) is *, no. Left to (4,5), then up to (3,5) is *, no. Left to (4,4), then what?\n\nLet me try a new approach. Let's try to find the path from the end backwards. Maybe that helps.\n\nThe destination is at (8,8). Let's see how to get there. From (8,8), it must come from (8,7). (8,7) is o. To get to (8,7), from where? From (8,6) or (7,7). Let's check.\n\n(8,7) is o. (7,7) is * (row 7 column 7 is *). So must come from (8,6). (8,6) is o. To get to (8,6), from (8,5) or (7,6). (7,6) is * (row 7 column 6 is *). So from (8,5). (8,5) is o. To get there, from (8,4) or (7,5). (7,5) is * (row 7 column 5 is *). So from (8,4). (8,4) is o. To get there, from (8,3) is *, so no. From (7,4). (7,4) is * (row 7 column 4 is *). So no. Dead end? Or maybe another way to (8,5).\n\nWait, maybe from (8,5), it could come from above, like (7,5), but that's *. So no. So how to get to (8,5)? From (8,4) or from (7,5). Both blocked. So perhaps this path isn't working. Let me backtrack.\n\nFrom (8,7), maybe there's another way to reach it. Like from (7,7), but it's *. No. So maybe the path to (8,8) goes through (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8). But how to get to (8,4)?\n\n(8,4) is o. To reach it, from (8,3) is * (blocked), or from (7,4). (7,4) is * (row 7 column 4 is *). So no. So how to get to (8,4)? From above, like (7,4) is blocked. Hmm.\n\nMaybe there's another way to reach (8,8). Let's think. From row 6, column 8 is o? Let me check row 6: \"ooo*o*o*o\". Column 8 is o. Yes. So from (6,8), can move down to (7,8) which is *? No, row 7 column 8 is o. Wait, row 7 is \"**o*****o\". Column 8 is o. So (7,8) is o. So from (6,8), move down to (7,8), then down to (8,8). Yes! So that's a possible path. Let's see if we can reach (6,8).\n\nSo the path would be: ... → (6,8) → down to (7,8) → down to (8,8).\n\nSo how to get to (6,8)? Let's look at row 6. Column 8 is o. To get there, from (6,7) which is * (row 6 column 7 is *), or from (5,8). (5,8) is o (row 5: \"o***o*o*o\" → column 8 is o). So from (5,8) move down to (6,8).\n\nSo to reach (5,8), how? Let's see. (5,8) is o. From there, can come from (5,7) which is * (row 5 column 7 is *), or from (4,8). (4,8) is o (row 4: \"ooo*ooo*o\" → column 8 is o). So from (4,8) move down to (5,8).\n\nTo reach (4,8), from (3,8) or (4,7). (4,7) is * (row 4 column 7 is *). (3,8) is o (row 3: \"o***o***o\" → column 8 is o). So from (3,8) move down to (4,8).\n\nTo reach (3,8), from (2,8) or (3,7). (3,7) is * (row 3 column 7 is *). (2,8) is o (row 2: \"o*o*o*o*o\" → column 8 is o). So from (2,8) move down to (3,8).\n\nTo reach (2,8), from (1,8) or (2,7). (2,7) is * (row 2 column 7 is *). (1,8) is o (row 1: \"o*o*o*o*o\" → column 8 is o). So from (1,8) move down to (2,8).\n\nTo reach (1,8), from (0,8) or (1,7). (1,7) is * (row 1 column 7 is *). (0,8) is o (row 0: \"Ioooooooo\" → column 8 is o). So from (0,8) move down to (1,8).\n\nSo the path from (0,8) down to (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), then down to (7,8), then to (8,8). But how to get to (0,8)? From the start at (0,0), need to move right all the way to (0,8). Let's see if that's possible.\n\nRow 0 is all o's (except the first character is I, which is start). So yes, from (0,0) move right repeatedly to (0,1), (0,2)... up to (0,8). Then down to (1,8), etc.\n\nSo this seems like a viable path! Let me verify.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Move right 8 times to (0,8). Then move down 7 times to (7,8), then down to (8,8). Let's check if that's possible.\n\nYes! Because row 0 allows moving right all the way. Let me confirm the maze:\n\nRow 0: I followed by 8 o's. So yes, (0,0) to (0,8) is all passable.\n\nThen, from (0,8), moving down through rows 1-8, column 8. Let's check each row's column 8:\n\nRow 1: column 8 is o (row 1 ends with o).\n\nRow 2: same as row 1, column 8 is o.\n\nRow 3: ends with o (row 3 is o***o***o).\n\nRow 4: ends with o (row 4 is ooo*ooo*o → column 8 is o? Wait, let me parse row 4: \"ooo*ooo*o\". Let's split into columns:\n\nColumns 0-2: ooo, column 3: *, columns 4-6: ooo, column 7: *, column 8: o. Yes. So column 8 is o.\n\nRow 5: \"o***o*o*o\" → column 8 is o.\n\nRow 6: \"ooo*o*o*o\" → column 8 is o.\n\nRow 7: \"**o*****o\" → column 8 is o.\n\nRow 8: column 8 is X. So yes, this path is possible!\n\nSo the path is: start at (0,0), move right 8 times to (0,8), then down 8 times to (8,8). But wait, from (0,8), to reach (8,8), need to move down 8 steps? No, from (0,8) to (8,8) is 8 rows down (since row 0 to row 8 is 8 steps down). But each move down is one step. So from (0,8), moving down 8 times would take you to (8,8). But let's count:\n\nFrom (0,8) to (1,8): 1st down.\n\n(1,8) to (2,8): 2nd.\n\n... up to (7,8) to (8,8): 8th down. Yes.\n\nSo the total moves are: 8 rights, then 8 downs. But let's check if there are any walls in column 8 for rows 1-7.\n\nRow 1, column 8: o.\n\nRow 2, column 8: o.\n\nRow 3, column 8: o.\n\nRow 4, column 8: o.\n\nRow 5, column 8: o.\n\nRow 6, column 8: o.\n\nRow 7, column 8: o.\n\nYes, all are o. So this is a valid path!\n\nBut why didn't I think of this earlier? Probably because I was focused on other paths and didn't consider going all the way right first. This seems like the simplest path.\n\nSo the moves would be:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (0,8): 8 'right' moves.\n\nThen from (0,8) to (8,8): 8 'down' moves.\n\nSo the total list is ['right'] * 8 + ['down'] * 8.\n\nBut let me verify the exact steps.\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\nMove right 8 times: positions (0,1), (0,2), ..., (0,8).\n\nThen move down 8 times: from (0,8) to (1,8), (2,8), ..., (8,8).\n\nYes. So the answer would be a list of 8 'right's followed by 8 'down's.\n\nBut let me check if there are any obstacles in this path. For example, row 0 allows moving right all the way. Yes. And column 8 allows moving down all the way. Yes.\n\nSo this is the correct path. It seems I overlooked this earlier by focusing on other paths, but this is much simpler.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: ['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']\n ;Answer: ['right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down']"

      "Okay, let's try to solve this maze problem. First, I need to understand the maze structure. The user provided an 11x11 grid, with 'I' as the start and 'X' as the end. The goal is to find a path from 'I' to 'X' using the allowed moves (up, down, left, right). The output should be a list of these directions.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the maze. Let me write down the maze rows to visualize it better. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: I * o * o * o o o o o  \nRow 1: o * o * o * o * * * * *  \nRow 2: o o o o o * o o o o o  \nRow 3: o * * * o * o * o * o  \nRow 4: o o o * o o o * o * o  \nRow 5: o * * * o * * * * * o  \nRow 6: o * o o o o o o o * o  \nRow 7: o * * * o * o * o * o  \nRow 8: o * o o o * o * o * o  \nRow 9: o * * * o * * * o * o  \nRow 10: o o o * o o o * o * X  \n\nWait, maybe I should index them from 0 to 10 for rows and columns. Let me find the starting position. The first row (row 0) starts with 'I', so the start is at (0,0). The end is at (10,10) since the last cell of row 10 is X.\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (10,10), avoiding the walls ('*') and moving through 'o's. Let's try to map out possible paths.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's look at possible moves. The cell to the right (0,1) is a '*', which is a wall. So can't go right. Can we go down? The cell below (0,0) is row 1, column 0, which is 'o' (from row 1: first cell is 'o'). So down is possible. Let's go down to (1,0).\n\nFrom (1,0), possible moves. Let's check directions. Right: (1,1) is '*', wall. Left is out of bounds. Up is back to start. So down or right? Wait, down is possible? Let's check row 2, column 0. Row 2 is \"ooooo*ooooo\", so column 0 is 'o'. So from (1,0), moving down to (2,0).\n\nSo path so far is ['down'] (from 0,0 to 1,0), then another 'down' to (2,0). Let's note that as ['down', 'down'].\n\nNow at (2,0). Let's look around. From here, can we move right? Let's check. The row is row 2, columns 0-4 are 'o's, then column 5 is '*', then o's again. So from (2,0), moving right is possible. Let's try moving right as much as possible. But need to check for walls.\n\nBut maybe there's a better approach. Since the maze is complex, perhaps I should use a systematic approach like BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS. But since I'm doing it manually, I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to sketch the path step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Down to (1,0). Then down to (2,0). Now, from (2,0), can move right. Let's go right to (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Because row 2 up to column 4 is all 'o's. Then column 5 is a wall. So from (2,4), maybe move down or up?\n\nBut where is the next direction? Let me check row 3. For column 4, row 3, column 4 is 'o' (row 3: \"o***o*o*o*o\" — let me parse that again. Wait, row 3 is \"o***o*o*o*o\". Let me break it down into each column:\n\nRow 3: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o. So at column 4, it's 'o'. So from (2,4), moving down to (3,4).\n\nSo path adds 'down' again. Now at (3,4). From here, possible directions: left would take us back. Let's check right: column 5 is *, so no. Up is (2,4), already visited. So can we go down? Let's check row 4, column 4. Row 4 is \"ooo*ooo*o*o\". Let me parse that:\n\nRow 4: columns 0-2: o, o, o; column 3: *, then columns 4-6: o, o, o; column 7: *, columns 8: o, 9: *, column 10: o. So (4,4) is o. So moving down to (4,4). Path adds another 'down'.\n\nNow at (4,4). From here, maybe move right? Let's check. (4,5) is o. So right. Then (4,6) is o. Then maybe right again? (4,7) is *, so can't. So perhaps from (4,6), can we move down? Let me check row 5's columns. Row 5 is \"o***o*****o\". Let's parse:\n\nRow 5: column 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, then columns 5-9: *, and column 10: o. So if we are at (4,6), moving down to (5,6) which is * (since columns 5-9 are *). So that's a wall. Can't go there. So maybe from (4,4), moving up? Or other directions.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,4), maybe move left? But that would take us back. Or maybe move down again? Let's check (5,4). Since row 5, column 4 is o. So moving down to (5,4). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (5,4). Let's look around. From here, can we move right? (5,5) is *, so no. Left? (5,3) is *, since row 5 columns 1-3 are *. So can't. Up is back to (4,4). Down? Row 6, column 4. Row 6 is \"o*ooooooo*o\". Let me parse row 6:\n\nRow 6: column 0: o, 1: *, then columns 2-8: o's, column 9: *, column 10: o. So (6,4) is o. So moving down to (6,4). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (6,4). From here, possible directions. Let's see. Let's check right. (6,5) is o. So moving right. Then (6,6) is o. Then (6,7) is o. Then (6,8) is o. Then (6,9) is *, can't go further. So maybe from (6,8), move down? Let's check row 7, column 8. Row 7 is \"o***o*o*o*o\". Let me parse:\n\nRow 7: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o. So (7,8) is o. So moving down from (6,8) to (7,8). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (7,8). From here, can we move right? Column 9 is *, so no. Left? (7,7) is *, so no. Up? Back to (6,8). Down? Row 8, column 8. Let's check row 8: \"o*ooo*o*o*o\". Parsing:\n\nRow 8: column 0: o, 1: *, columns 2-4: o, o, o, column 5: *, column 6: o, column 7: *, column 8: o, column 9: *, column 10: o. So (8,8) is o. Moving down to (8,8). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (8,8). Let's see. From here, can we move right? Column 9 is *, no. Left to (8,7): column 7 is *, so no. Up to (7,8). Down to (9,8). Let's check row 9, column 8. Row 9 is \"o***o***o*o\". Parsing:\n\nRow 9: column 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o. So (9,8) is o. Moving down to (9,8). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (9,8). From here, possible directions. Let's check down to (10,8). Row 10, column 8: looking at row 10: \"ooo*ooo*o*X\". Columns 0-2: o, o, o; column 3: *, columns 4-6: o, o, o; column 7: *, column 8: o, column 9: *, column 10: X. So (10,8) is o. Wait, but we need to reach X at (10,10). So moving down from (9,8) to (10,8). Then from there, need to get to X. Let's see.\n\nAt (10,8), can we move right? Column 9 is *, so no. Column 10 is X. So from (10,8), moving right to (10,9) is blocked, but to reach X, perhaps we need to move left or find another path. Hmm. Maybe this path is getting stuck here. Let me retrace steps to see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from (9,8), instead of moving down, we can move left? Let's check. From (9,8), moving left to (9,7) is * (row 9 column 7 is *), so no. Moving up to (8,8). From (8,8), maybe move left? Let's check. (8,7) is *, so no. How about from (8,8), moving up? (7,8) is o. Then up again to (6,8), then left?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different route. Let me think. Maybe I took a wrong turn earlier. Let's try to see if there's another path.\n\nLet me try to backtrack. Let's go back to (6,4). From there, I moved right to (6,5), then to (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). Then down to (7,8), etc. But perhaps from (6,4), instead of going all the way right, there's another way. Let's see. From (6,4), maybe move left? But that would take us back up. Or maybe up? Let's check.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,4), moving right to (6,5), then up? Let me check. But maybe that's not helpful. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from (4,4), instead of going down to (5,4), perhaps go right? Let me check. (4,4) is in row 4, column 4. Moving right to (4,5) which is o, then (4,6) o. Then can we move down? Let's check row 5. For column 5, row 5 is *, so can't. So from (4,6), moving down to row 5, column 6. Let me check row 5's column 6. Row 5 is \"o***o*****o\". Columns 0: o, 1-3: *, 4: o, 5-9: *, 10: o. So column 6 is *, so can't move down. So stuck. So perhaps from (4,6), move right to (4,7) which is *, no. So back to (4,6). Maybe up? Or left?\n\nHmm. So maybe the original path is the way to go. Let's continue with that. So we were at (9,8). If I move down to (10,8), then from (10,8), need to find a way to X. Let me check the row 10. From (10,8), moving left to (10,7) is *, so no. Moving right is blocked. How about moving left until we can go up? Wait, (10,8) is column 8. Let me check columns 4-6 of row 10. They are o's. So maybe from (10,8), move left to (10,6), but need to check if the path is open. Let's see:\n\nRow 10: columns 7 is *, so between column 8 and 6, column 7 is blocked. So can't go directly. So perhaps from (10,8), need to go up. Let's check. From (10,8), moving up to (9,8). Then left? From (9,8), can we move left? Let's check row 9. At (9,8), moving left to (9,7) is *, no. How about up to (8,8), then left? From (8,8), moving left. Let's check row 8. At (8,8), column 7 is *, so can't go left. So stuck again. Hmm.\n\nThis suggests that maybe there's a detour earlier. Let me think. Maybe from (7,8), instead of going down to (8,8), there's another path. Let me check. From (7,8), can we move right? No, because column 9 is *. Left? Column 7 is * for row 7. Up? (6,8) is o. Down to (8,8). So no other options. Maybe there's another way from (6,8). Let me think. From (6,8), maybe move left? Let's see. (6,8) is column 8. Moving left to (6,7), then (6,6), etc. Let's check. From (6,8), moving left to (6,7): o. Then left to (6,6): o. Then left to (6,5): o. Then left to (6,4): o. From there, maybe down?\n\nWait, but we were already at (6,4) earlier. So perhaps this is a loop. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from (6,8), moving up? (5,8). Let's check row 5, column 8. Row 5 is columns 5-9: *, so column 8 is *. Can't go there. So no. How about moving down to (7,8) which we already did.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to backtrack further. Let me go back to (4,4). From there, I went down to (5,4), then down to (6,4). What if instead, from (4,4), I go left? Let's check. From (4,4), moving left to (4,3) is *, since row 4 column 3 is *. No. Up to (3,4): o. From there, maybe?\n\nAt (3,4), which is row 3. From (3,4), possible directions: up is row 2, column 4 (o). Down is row 4, column 4 (o). Left? (3,3) is *, no. Right? (3,5) is *, no. So maybe from (3,4), move up to (2,4). Then from (2,4), maybe move right? But we already did that. Or left? From (2,4), moving left to (2,3), then (2,2), etc. Let's see. From (2,4), moving left to (2,3): o. Then left to (2,2): o. Then left to (2,1): *, no. So can't. So back to (2,3). From there, maybe down? Let's check row 3, column 3 is *, so can't. Hmm. So that path doesn't help.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe from (2,0), instead of going all the way right to (2,4), take a different route. Let me think. Starting from (2,0), moving right to (2,1) is blocked (since row 2's first cell is o, then next is o? Wait, row 2 is \"ooooo*ooooo\". Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal maze row 2: \"ooooo*ooooo\". That's 5 o's, then a *, then 5 o's. So columns 0-4: o, o, o, o, o. Column 5 is *, columns 6-10: o, o, o, o, o. So yes, from (2,0), moving right to (2,4) is possible. So perhaps I need to find another way.\n\nWait, maybe from (2,4), instead of going down to (3,4), go right to (2,5)? No, that's a wall. So no. So maybe the only way is to proceed as before.\n\nLet me think again. After reaching (9,8), which leads to (10,8), and then stuck. Maybe there's another path from earlier steps. Let me check.\n\nLet me go back to (6,4). From there, I went right to (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). What if instead, from (6,4), I move up? Let's check. Up to (5,4). Which is o. From there, can we move left? Let's check (5,4) is column 4. Moving left to (5,3) is *, so no. Moving right to (5,5) is *, no. Up to (4,4), which we already did. Down to (6,4). So not helpful.\n\nAlternative idea: From (4,4), instead of going down to (5,4), maybe go left? No, because (4,3) is *.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to find another path earlier. Let me think about the starting steps again. Starting at (0,0), down to (1,0), then down to (2,0). What if instead, from (0,0), there's another direction? Like right? But (0,1) is *, no. Down is only option. So that's correct.\n\nAnother possibility: From (2,0), maybe go down further? Let's check. From (2,0), down to (3,0). Let's check what's there. Row 3, column 0 is o. So moving down. So path would be ['down', 'down', 'down'].\n\nNow at (3,0). From here, can move right? Let's check. Row 3: columns 0 is o, 1-3 are *, column 4 is o. So from (3,0), moving right to (3,1) is *, no. So can't. So up to (2,0), or down to (4,0). Let's check (4,0): row 4, column 0 is o. So moving down. Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (4,0). From here, can move right? Let's check. Row 4 has columns 0-2 as o's. So moving right to (4,1), then (4,2), then (4,3) is *. Let me try. From (4,0), move right to (4,1), then (4,2). From (4,2), can we move down? Row 5, column 2 is * (row 5's columns 1-3 are *). So no. How about up? To (3,2) which is *. No. Left? Back. Or maybe move down to (5,2) which is *? No. So stuck. Not helpful. So this path may not work. Let me backtrack.\n\nSo perhaps going down to (3,0) isn't helpful. Let's return to the earlier path.\n\nBack to (2,0), moving right to (2,4), down to (3,4), then down to (4,4), then down to (5,4), then down to (6,4), then right to (6,8), etc. Now stuck at (10,8). Let me think if there's another way from (8,8). From (8,8), maybe move up to (7,8), then left? No, since (7,7) is *. Or from (7,8), move up to (6,8), then left? Let's see.\n\nAt (6,8), moving left to (6,7), which is o. Then left to (6,6), o. Then left to (6,5), o. Then left to (6,4), o. From there, maybe down to (7,4)? Let's check row 7, column 4: o. So moving down. Path would be from (6,4) to (7,4). Let me see if this is part of the previous path. Earlier, I had gone from (6,4) to (6,8), but if instead, from (6,4) I go down to (7,4), that might be a different route.\n\nLet me try this alternative path. Let's retrace:\n\nFrom earlier steps:\n\nStart: (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,4) → down to (3,4) → down to (4,4) → down to (5,4) → down to (6,4). Now, instead of going right, go down to (7,4).\n\nSo path adds 'down' here. Now at (7,4). From here, can move directions. Let's check. Row 7, column 4 is o. Can we move right? (7,5) is *, no. Left? (7,3) is *, no. Up? (6,4). Down? Row 8, column 4. Row 8, column 4 is o (row 8: columns 2-4 are o's). So moving down to (8,4). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (8,4). From here, can move right? (8,5) is *, no. Left? (8,3) is o. Let me check row 8: columns 2-4 are o's. So (8,3) is o. Moving left to (8,3). Then left to (8,2), which is o. Then left to (8,1) is *, no. So from (8,2), can we move down? Row 9, column 2 is * (row 9's columns 1-3 are *). So no. Up to (7,2)? Let me check row 7, column 2 is *, no. So stuck? Or maybe move right back to (8,3), then down?\n\nWait, from (8,3), can we move down? Row 9, column 3 is * (row 9 columns 1-3 are *). No. How about from (8,4), move up to (7,4), then right? No, (7,5) is *. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,4), move up to (7,4), then left? (7,3) is *, no. This seems stuck. Maybe this alternative path isn't working. Let me try another approach.\n\nBack to (7,4). From there, can I move up to (6,4), then left? Let's say from (6,4), move left to (6,3), which is o? Wait, row 6: columns 0 is o, then column 1 is *, so columns 2-8 are o's. So (6,3) is o. Wait, row 6 is \"o*ooooooo*o\". So columns 0: o, 1: *, columns 2-8: o's, column 9: *, column 10: o. So yes, (6,3) is o. So from (6,4), moving left to (6,3). Then left to (6,2), etc.\n\nLet me try this. From (7,4), up to (6,4). Then left to (6,3), then left to (6,2), then left to (6,1) which is *? No. So (6,2) is o. From (6,2), can we move down? Row 7, column 2 is *, so no. Up to (5,2) which is *? Yes, row 5 columns 1-3 are *. So no. How about right? Back to (6,3). From there, down to (7,3) is *? Row 7 column 3 is *, yes. So stuck again.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different route I haven't considered. Let me think about other parts of the maze.\n\nLooking at the maze, maybe there's a way to go around the walls. For example, from the starting area, maybe go down to row 2, then right to column 6 (since row 2, column 5 is a wall, but columns 6-10 are o's). Let me check. From (2,4), moving right to (2,5) is blocked. So no. But if there's a way to get to row 2, column 6?\n\nWait, row 2's columns 6-10 are o's. So if I can get to (2,6), then maybe proceed from there. How to get there? From (2,4), can't move right past column 4. So perhaps from (3,4), move right? Let me check. From (3,4), which is row 3 column 4 (o), can we move right to (3,5) which is *? No. So no. How about from (4,4), move right to (4,5) which is o? Yes! Wait, row 4: columns 0-2: o, column 3: *, columns 4-6: o, column 7: *, etc. So from (4,4), moving right to (4,5) is o, then to (4,6) is o. From there, can we move down? Let me check row 5's column 5: it's *, so no. But maybe move up or left?\n\nFrom (4,6), moving up to (3,6). Let me check row 3, column 6: row 3 is \"o***o*o*o*o\". Columns 0: o, 1-3: *, column 4: o, column 5: *, column 6: o, column 7: *, column 8: o, column 9: *, column 10: o. So (3,6) is o. So from (4,6), move up to (3,6). Path adds 'up'.\n\nNow at (3,6). From here, can move directions. Let's see. Right to (3,7) is *, no. Left to (3,5) is *, no. Up to (2,6): row 2, column 6 is o. So moving up to (2,6). Path adds 'up'.\n\nNow at (2,6). From here, can move right to (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (2,10). Let's check. Row 2, columns 6-10 are o's. So yes. So moving right to (2,10). Path would be multiple 'right's. Let me count the steps from (2,6) to (2,10): 4 steps right. So path adds ['right', 'right', 'right', 'right'].\n\nNow at (2,10). From here, can we move down? Let's check row 3, column 10. Row 3's column 10 is o. So moving down to (3,10). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (3,10). From here, can move down to (4,10). Let me check row 4, column 10: o. So down. Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (4,10). From here, can we move down? Row 5, column 10 is o. So down. Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (5,10). From here, can move down to (6,10). Row 6's column 10 is o. Down. Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (6,10). From here, can move down to (7,10). Row 7's column 10 is o. Down. Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (7,10). From here, can move down to (8,10). Row 8's column 10 is o? Let me check row 8: \"o*ooo*o*o*o\". Columns 10: last character is o? Let me count. The row is o * o o o * o * o * o. So column 10 is o. Yes. So down to (8,10). Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (8,10). From here, can move down to (9,10). Row 9's column 10 is o? Let me check row 9: \"o***o***o*o\". Last character is o. Yes. Down. Path adds 'down'.\n\nNow at (9,10). From here, can move down to (10,10), which is X! So final step is 'down'. Path adds 'down'.\n\nSo this seems to be a valid path! Let me retrace all the steps to ensure there are no errors.\n\nLet me list the steps again:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\n1. Down to (1,0)\n2. Down to (2,0)\n3. Down to (2,0) → wait, no. Wait, from (2,0), how do we get to (4,4)? Let me recheck the steps.\n\nWait, earlier I said that from (0,0) down to (1,0), then down to (2,0). Then from (2,0), moving down to (3,0) was considered but not taken. Instead, the original path was moving right to (2,4). But in this new alternative path, I need to get to (4,4) to move up to (3,6). So let me make sure the steps are correct.\n\nLet me outline the full path:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nStep 1: down → (1,0)\nStep 2: down → (2,0)\nStep 3: right → (2,1) (but row 2 column 1 is o? Wait row 2 is \"ooooo*ooooo\", so columns 0-4 are o's. So from (2,0), moving right four times to reach (2,4).\n\nSo steps 3-6: four 'right' moves: right, right, right, right.\n\nNow at (2,4).\n\nStep 7: down → (3,4)\nStep 8: down → (4,4)\nStep 9: down → (5,4)\nStep 10: down → (6,4)\nStep 11: down → (7,4)? Or from (6,4), instead of going right, go down to (7,4)? Or wait, from (6,4), how do we get to (4,6)?\n\nAh, earlier I said from (4,4) move right to (4,5) and (4,6), then up to (3,6), then up to (2,6), etc. So let me adjust the steps.\n\nLet me correct the path:\n\nAfter reaching (4,4) via steps 7-8-9-10 (from (2,4) down to (4,4)):\n\nAt (4,4), move right to (4,5) → step 11: 'right'\n\nAt (4,5), move right to (4,6) → step 12: 'right'\n\nNow at (4,6), move up to (3,6) → step 13: 'up'\n\nAt (3,6), move up to (2,6) → step 14: 'up'\n\nNow at (2,6), move right to (2,7) → step 15: 'right'\n\nMove right to (2,8) → step 16: 'right'\n\nMove right to (2,9) → step 17: 'right'\n\nMove right to (2,10) → step 18: 'right'\n\nNow at (2,10), move down to (3,10) → step 19: 'down'\n\nAt (3,10), move down to (4,10) → step 20: 'down'\n\nAt (4,10), move down to (5,10) → step 21: 'down'\n\nAt (5,10), move down to (6,10) → step 22: 'down'\n\nAt (6,10), move down to (7,10) → step 23: 'down'\n\nAt (7,10), move down to (8,10) → step 24: 'down'\n\nAt (8,10), move down to (9,10) → step 25: 'down'\n\nAt (9,10), move down to (10,10) → step 26: 'down'\n\nSo the total path is:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']\n\nWait, let me count the steps properly:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nFrom start:\n\n1. down (step 1)\n2. down (step 2)\nThen from (2,0), four rights to reach (2,4) (steps 3-6: right x4)\nThen down to (3,4) (step 7)\ndown to (4,4) (step 8)\ndown to (5,4) (step 9)\ndown to (6,4) (step 10)\nthen right to (4,5) and (4,6) — wait, no. From (6,4), how do we get to (4,6)? That part is unclear. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. From (6,4), how do we get to (4,6)? That would require moving up, then right.\n\nLet me correct this. After reaching (6,4) via steps 1-10 (steps 1-2: down, down; steps 3-6: right x4; steps 7-10: down x3? Wait:\n\nOriginal steps after (2,0):\n\nSteps 3: down to (3,0)? No, earlier I said from (2,4), down to (3,4). So steps 7 is down from (2,4) to (3,4), step 8 down to (4,4), step 9 down to (5,4), step 10 down to (6,4). So from (6,4), we need to move up to (5,4), then up to (4,4), then right to (4,5), (4,6), etc. Wait, no. From (6,4), moving up to (5,4), then up to (4,4). Then from (4,4), move right to (4,5) and (4,6). So steps after (6,4):\n\nStep 11: up to (5,4)\nStep 12: up to (4,4)\nStep 13: right to (4,5)\nStep 14: right to (4,6)\nStep 15: up to (3,6)\nStep 16: up to (2,6)\nThen steps 17-20: right x4 to (2,10)\nThen down steps to reach X.\n\nSo the full path would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']\n\nLet me count each step:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\n1. down → (1,0)\n2. down → (2,0)\n3. right → (2,1)\n4. right → (2,2)\n5. right → (2,3)\n6. right → (2,4)\n7. down → (3,4)\n8. down → (4,4)\n9. down → (5,4)\n10. down → (6,4)\n11. up → (5,4)\n12. up → (4,4)\n13. right → (4,5)\n14. right → (4,6)\n15. up → (3,6)\n16. up → (2,6)\n17. right → (2,7)\n18. right → (2,8)\n19. right → (2,9)\n20. right → (2,10)\n21. down → (3,10)\n22. down → (4,10)\n23. down → (5,10)\n24. down → (6,10)\n25. down → (7,10)\n26. down → (8,10)\n27. down → (9,10)\n28. down → (10,10)\n\nYes, this seems to work. Now let's verify each movement:\n\nFrom (6,4) up to (5,4): valid.\n\nFrom (5,4) up to (4,4): valid.\n\nFrom (4,4) right to (4,5): valid.\n\nFrom (4,5) right to (4,6): valid.\n\nFrom (4,6) up to (3,6): valid (row 3, column 6 is o).\n\nFrom (3,6) up to (2,6): valid.\n\nThen moving right four times to (2,10): valid since row 2 columns 6-10 are o's.\n\nThen down steps from (2,10) to (10,10): each step is valid as the columns 10 in respective rows are o or X.\n\nYes! This path should work. Now, let's convert this into the list of directions.\n\nThe directions are:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. down\n2. down\n3. right\n4. right\n5. right\n6. right\n7. down\n8. down\n9. down\n10. up\n11. up\n12. right\n13. right\n14. up\n15. up\n16. right\n17. right\n18. right\n19. right\n20. down\n21. down\n22. down\n23. down\n24. down\n25. down\n26. down\n27. down\n28. down\n\nWait, but the number of steps from (2,10) to (10,10) is 8 downs (from row 2 to row 10: 10-2=8 steps). Let me count:\n\nFrom (2,10) to (3,10): down (step 20)\n(3,10) to (4,10): down (step 21)\n(4,10) to (5,10): down (step 22)\n(5,10) to (6,10): down (step 23)\n(6,10) to (7,10): down (step 24)\n(7,10) to (8,10): down (step 25)\n(8,10) to (9,10): down (step 26)\n(9,10) to (10,10): down (step 27)\n\nSo that's 8 steps, not 9. Let me recount the total steps:\n\nTotal steps:\n\nSteps 1-2: 2 downs\nSteps 3-6: 4 rights\nSteps 7-9: 3 downs\nSteps 10-11: 2 ups\nSteps 12-13: 2 rights\nSteps 14-15: 2 ups\nSteps 16-19: 4 rights\nSteps 20-27: 8 downs\n\nTotal of 2+4+3+2+2+2+4+8 = 27 steps? Let's count:\n\n2 (downs) + 4 (rights) = 6\n+3 (downs) = 9\n+2 (ups) = 11\n+2 (rights) = 13\n+2 (ups) = 15\n+4 (rights) = 19\n+8 (downs) = 27 steps.\n\nYes. So the list would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']\n\nLet me check if this is correct by tracing each step:\n\nStarting at (0,0).\n\nAfter step 1: down → (1,0)\nAfter step 2: down → (2,0)\nSteps 3-6: right four times → (2,4)\nSteps 7-9: down three times → (5,4)\nSteps 10-11: up two times → (4,4)\nSteps 12-13: right two times → (4,6)\nSteps 14-15: up two times → (2,6)\nSteps 16-19: right four times → (2,10)\nSteps 20-27: down eight times → (10,10). Yes, that's correct.\n\nThis path should work. Now, I need to output this as a list of directions. Let me write it out.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','up','up','right','right','up','up','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this 5x5 maze. Let me first visualize the maze based on the given input.\n\nThe maze is:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o\nRow 1: o * o * o\nRow 2: o * o * o\nRow 3: o * o * *\nRow 4: o * o o X\n\nSo the start is at position (0,0). The destination is at (4,4). Let me note the positions.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. The available directions are up, down, left, right. But since it's a grid, movement is constrained by the walls.\n\nLet me start by trying to map out possible paths. Let's think step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). From here, possible moves: can I go right or down? Let's check.\n\nLooking at the starting cell (row 0, column 0). To the right is (0,1) which is 'o' (empty). Down is (1,0) which is 'o' as well. So both options.\n\nMaybe I can try going down first. Let's try that.\n\nSo first move is 'down' to (1,0). Now from (1,0), where can I go? Let's check possible directions.\n\nUp would take me back to (0,0). Down to (2,0) which is 'o'. Right to (1,1) is a wall (*), so no. Left is out of bounds. So from (1,0), down to (2,0).\n\nNext move: 'down' to (2,0). From here, again check. Down to (3,0) which is 'o'. Up would take back. So let's go down again.\n\nMove 'down' to (3,0). Now from (3,0), down to (4,0) which is 'o'. Let's do that. Now at (4,0). From here, moving right: (4,1) is '*', which is a wall. So can't go right. Up to (3,0) again? Maybe need to find another path.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,0), can I go right? (3,1) is '*', no. So only up or down. Down would be row 5 which doesn't exist. So stuck here? Maybe this path is a dead end. Let me backtrack.\n\nSo backtracking from (4,0): perhaps instead of going down all the way, there's another way. Let me think. From (2,0), maybe instead of going down again, go right?\n\nWait, (2,0) is row 2, column 0. Let me check what's to the right. (2,1) is a wall. So no. So no, can't go right. So only up or down. If down leads to a dead end, maybe up?\n\nBut up would take back to (1,0). Hmm. So maybe the initial approach of going right from the start is better.\n\nLet me try that. Starting at (0,0). First move 'right' to (0,1). Wait, but (0,1) is 'o'? Yes. Wait the first row is Ioooo, so row 0 is I o o o o. So (0,0) is I, (0,1) is o, (0,2) o, etc.\n\nBut from (0,1), possible moves: left back, down to (1,1) which is a wall. Or right to (0,2). Wait, moving right from (0,1) would take me to (0,2), which is o. So maybe go right again. But perhaps I need to find a path that weaves through the maze.\n\nLooking at the maze structure, it seems like there are walls alternating in rows 1 and 2, etc. Let me think of the maze as a grid:\n\nRow 0: [I, o, o, o, o]\nRow 1: [o, *, o, *, o]\nRow 2: [o, *, o, *, o]\nRow 3: [o, *, o, *, *]\nRow 4: [o, *, o, o, X]\n\nSo the maze has vertical walls in columns 1 and 3 (for some rows). So perhaps the path needs to zig-zag through the even rows?\n\nLet me try starting with moving right. Let's see:\n\nStart at (0,0). Let's move right four times to reach (0,4). But then, from there, can I go down? Let's check.\n\n(0,4) is row 0, column 4. Down is (1,4), which is 'o' (row 1, column 4). So yes. So move down. Then from (1,4), can we go down again to row 2, column 4? Which is 'o'. Then down again to row 3, column 4? But row 3, column 4 is '*' (as per row 3: o*o**). So no. So stuck again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,4), maybe move left? Let's think. From (1,4), left would take us through column 3 (which is * in row 1), so can't. So perhaps from (1,4), go down to (2,4), then from there?\n\n(2,4) is o. From there, down to (3,4) is *, so no. So maybe left? From (2,4), left steps: (2,3) is * (row 2's column 3 is *). So can't. So again stuck. So maybe that path isn't working.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me think of possible paths. Since the maze seems to have vertical walls, maybe the path needs to snake through the columns.\n\nLooking at the start at (0,0). Let's try going down to (1,0), then right to (1,2) if possible? Wait, from (1,0), moving right: (1,1) is a wall. So can't. So only down or up. If down to (2,0), then right?\n\nFrom (2,0), can I move right? (2,1) is *, no. So no. So again stuck. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe go right, down, right, down... Let's try.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Move right to (0,1). Then down to (1,1) but that's a wall. No. So that's not allowed. So perhaps move right again to (0,2). From there, can we go down? (1,2) is o. Yes. So move down. Now at (1,2). From here, can we move down again to (2,2) which is o. Then down to (3,2) which is o. Then down to (4,2) which is o. Now at (4,2). From there, need to get to (4,4). So right twice. But let's check.\n\nAt (4,2), moving right to (4,3): which is o. Then right again to (4,4) which is X. Yes! So that's a possible path. Let me retrace the steps.\n\nPath steps:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nMove right to (0,1) → 'right'\n\nMove down to (1,2) → but how? From (0,1), moving down would take me to (1,1), which is a wall. Oh, right. So that's not possible. So how to get to (1,2)? From (0,1), can't go down to (1,1) because it's a wall. So maybe from (0,1), move right again to (0,2). Then down to (1,2). Because (1,2) is o. Yes. So:\n\n(0,0) → right → (0,1)\n\nright → (0,2)\n\ndown → (1,2)\n\nThen down → (2,2)\n\ndown → (3,2)\n\ndown → (4,2)\n\nThen right → (4,3)\n\nright → (4,4). \n\nSo the moves would be: right, right, down, down, down, down, right, right. Let me translate that into directions.\n\nEach move between steps:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (0,1): right\n\n(0,1) to (0,2): right\n\n(0,2) to (1,2): down\n\n(1,2) to (2,2): down\n\n(2,2) to (3,2): down\n\n(3,2) to (4,2): down\n\n(4,2) to (4,3): right\n\n(4,3) to (4,4): right.\n\nSo the list of moves would be ['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right'].\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any obstacles in those steps. Let's check each position:\n\n(0,0): start.\n\n(0,1): o. Good.\n\n(0,2): o. Good.\n\nDown to (1,2): row 1, column 2 is o. Yes.\n\nThen down to row 2, column 2: o. Yes.\n\nRow 3, column 2: o. Yes.\n\nRow 4, column 2: o. Yes.\n\nThen right to (4,3): row 4, column 3 is o. Yes.\n\nRight to (4,4): X. Correct.\n\nSo that path works. So the answer would be that list of moves. But let me check if there's a shorter path. For example, maybe some combination of moving up and down?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another route. Let me think. For example, starting with down, then right when possible. But the above seems valid.\n\nAnother possible path: starting at (0,0), go down to (1,0), then right to (1,2), but how? From (1,0), can we move right? Let's see. From (1,0), moving right to (1,1) is blocked. So can't. So need to go down again to (2,0), then right? But (2,0) can move right to (2,1) which is blocked. No. So again, need to go down to (3,0), then down to (4,0). From (4,0), can we go right to (4,1)? No, because it's a wall. So stuck. Then from (4,0), can we go up to (3,0), then right? (3,0) to (3,1) is blocked. No. So that path is stuck. Hence, the earlier path is better.\n\nTherefore, the correct path is the one that goes right twice, then down four times (from (0,2) down to (4,2)), then right twice. Let me confirm the number of down moves. From (0,2) to (1,2): first down. Then (1,2) to (2,2): second. Then to (3,2): third. Then to (4,2): fourth. So four down moves. Then two right moves. So the list is ['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right'].\n\nBut let me check if there's any other possible path. For example, maybe starting with right, down, right, down... Let me think.\n\nAlternative path:\n\n(0,0) → right to (0,1)\n\ndown to (1,1) → blocked. No.\n\nAnother idea: (0,0) → right to (0,1) → right to (0,2) → down to (1,2) → right to (1,3) is blocked. So no. So from (1,2), can't go right. So need to go down again. So yes, same as before.\n\nAnother possibility: from (1,2), go down to (2,2), then right? (2,2) is o. From there, can we go right to (2,3)? Which is * (row 2 has o*o*o). So (2,3) is *, so no. So no. So again, need to go down further.\n\nSo yes, the initial path seems correct.\n\nSo the answer is the list of moves as described. Now, translating that into the required format: Answer: ['right','right','down','down','down','down','right','right'].\n\nWait, let me count again. From (0,0):\n\nMove 1: right → (0,1)\n\nMove 2: right → (0,2)\n\nMove 3: down → (1,2)\n\nMove 4: down → (2,2)\n\nMove 5: down → (3,2)\n\nMove 6: down → (4,2)\n\nMove 7: right → (4,3)\n\nMove 8: right → (4,4)\n\nYes, that's 8 moves. So the list has 8 elements. Looks correct.\n\nI think that's the correct path. Let me check if there's any mistake. For example, in row 3, column 2 is o? Yes. Because row 3 is o*o**. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *. So (3,2) is o. Then down to (4,2): row 4 is o*o o X. So row 4, columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: X. Yes, (4,2) is o. Then right to (4,3) which is o, then to (4,4) X. All correct. So this path works.\n ;Answer: ['right','right','down','down','down','down','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start 'I' to the destination 'X' in this maze. The maze is 11x11 based on the input. Let me first try to visualize the maze.\n\nThe first line is \"Ioooooooooo\". So the starting point is at position (0,0). The next lines have various walls and open spaces. Let me write down the coordinates. Let's consider rows and columns, starting from 0. So the start is at (0,0). The destination 'X' is at the end of the last line, which is row 10. Let me check the last line: \"ooo*ooooooX\". So in row 10, the X is at column 10, assuming that the line has 11 characters. Let me count the characters in each line to confirm. Each line seems to have 11 characters. For example, the first line is I followed by 10 o's. So rows are 0 to 10 (assuming 11 rows?), wait wait, wait. Wait, the input is given as 11 lines? Let me count:\n\nThe user provided the maze as:\n\nLine 1: Ioooooooooo (11 characters: I + 10 o's)\nThen 10 more lines? Let me count:\n\nThe lines listed are:\n\n1. Ioooooooooo\n2. o***o*****o\n3. ooo*ooooo*o\n4. o*o*******o\n5. o*ooooooo*o\n6. o***o******\n7. ooo*ooooooo\n8. o*o*o******\n9. o*o*ooo*ooo\n10. o***o***o**\n11. ooo*ooooooX\n\nYes, 11 rows. So rows 0 to 10. The X is in row 10, column 10.\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (10,10), moving up, down, left, right, through cells marked 'o', avoiding the '*' walls.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the positions. Let me sketch the maze mentally.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's check adjacent cells. The first row is all o's except the first character is I. So row 0 is I (position 0,0), then o's from 0,1 to 0,10. Wait, no. Wait, the first line is \"Ioooooooooo\" which is 1 character I followed by 10 o's. So row 0 has columns 0 to 10. So (0,0) is I, (0,1) is o, (0,2) is o, etc.\n\nNow, the second row (row 1) is \"o***o*****o\". Let's break it down:\n\nColumns 0: o\nColumns 1: *\nColumns 2: *\nColumns 3: *\nColumns 4: o\nColumns 5: *\nColumns 6: *\nColumns 7: *\nColumns 8: *\nColumns 9: * ?\nWait, let me recount. The line is \"o***o*****o\". Let's count each character:\n\nPosition 1,0: o\n1,1: *\n1,2: *\n1,3: *\nThen next is o at position 4?\nThen followed by five *? Let me count:\n\nOriginal string: o *** o ***** o. So between the o's, three * then, then five *? Let me check:\n\nOriginal line: o***o*****o → o followed by three *, then o, then five *, then o? Let's count the total length. o (1) + 3 * + o (so 1+3+1=5) + five * and then o. 5 + 5 + 1 = 11. Yes. So for row 1:\n\ncolumns 0: o\ncolumns 1-3: *\ncolumn 4: o\ncolumns 5-9: * (5 stars)\ncolumn 10: o.\n\nSo row 1, column 4 is o, and column 10 is o. So from the starting point, which is row 0, column 0, possible moves could be down (to row 1, column 0, which is o) or right (to row 0, column 1, which is o). Let's think about possible paths.\n\nBut since the maze is complex, perhaps the best approach is to model it as a grid and perform a BFS (breadth-first search) to find the shortest path. Since I need to output the path as a list of directions, I need to track the path taken.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, I need to simulate the BFS or find a path step by step.\n\nLet me start from (0,0). Let's mark visited positions to avoid cycles.\n\nPossible first moves:\n\nFrom (0,0), can move down (to (1,0)) or right (to (0,1)).\n\nLet me try to explore possible paths.\n\nOption 1: Move right first. So from (0,0) to (0,1). Then maybe continue right along the top row. But need to check if that's feasible. However, the destination is at bottom right. So perhaps moving down earlier is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to go down first. Let's try.\n\nLet me try to plan a path.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's try to go down to (1,0). Then, from (1,0), can we move down again? Let's check row 2 (row index 2). Let's look at row 2's data: \"ooo*ooooo*o\".\n\nRow 2: columns 0-2 are o, then column 3 is *, then columns 4-8 are o, column 9 is *, column 10 is o.\n\nSo (2,0) is o. So from (1,0), moving down to (2,0). Then again down to (3,0)? Let's check row 3: \"o*o*******o\". So row 3, column 0 is o. Then column 1 is *, column 2 is o? Wait, let me parse the third line (row 2 is line 3? Wait the lines:\n\nLine 1: row 0?\n\nWait, the first line is row 0. So line 1 (the first line) is row 0. The second line (o***o...) is row 1, third line (ooo*...) is row 2, etc.\n\nRow 3 is line 4: \"o*o*******o\". Let's parse:\n\ncolumns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, then columns 3-8: *, and column 9: *, column 10: o. So (3,0) is o. So yes, from (2,0) can move down to (3,0). Then from (3,0), can we move down again? Let's check row 4 (line 5): \"o*ooooooo*o\". Row 4, column 0 is o. So yes, down to (4,0). Then row 5 (line 6): \"o***o******\". Let's check column 0: o? The line is \"o***o******\". So first character is o (column 0), then three * (columns 1-3), then o at column 4, then all * after. So (5,0) is o. So down again. Continue this?\n\nSo from (0,0) down to (5,0). Let's check row 5, column 0. Then from there, can we go down? Row 6 (line 7): \"ooo*ooooooo\". Column 0: o. So yes. Down to (6,0). Then row 7 (line 8): \"o*o*o******\". Column 0 is o. Then down again to (7,0). Row 8 (line 9): \"o*o*ooo*ooo\". Column 0 is o. Down to (8,0). Row 9 (line 10): \"o***o***o**\". Column 0 is o. Down to (9,0). Row 10 (line 11): \"ooo*ooooooX\". Column 0 is o. So (10,0). Now, from here, need to get to (10,10). Let's see. But row 10's line is \"ooo*ooooooX\". Let's parse:\n\ncolumns 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, then columns 4-9: o, and column 10: X. So from (10,0), can move right through columns 0 to 2 (all o's), but at column 3 it's blocked. So perhaps this path down to the bottom row and then moving right is blocked at column 3. So maybe this approach hits a dead end. Therefore, perhaps the initial path of moving straight down isn't the right way.\n\nSo perhaps I need to find another path. Let me backtrack.\n\nLet me think again. Starting at (0,0). Maybe moving right a bit first, then down.\n\nFor example, from (0,0) move right to (0,1), then right again to (0,2), etc. Let's see. But need to check for walls in lower rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to go down, then right, etc.\n\nLet me try to find a path step by step. Maybe using BFS approach mentally.\n\nLet me consider positions as (row, column). The start is (0,0). Let's track visited positions.\n\nLet me try to outline possible paths.\n\nFirst, from (0,0):\n\nPossible moves:\n\nDown to (1,0) or right to (0,1).\n\nLet me try down first. Let's explore that path first.\n\nPath 1:\n\n(0,0) → down → (1,0)\n\nFrom (1,0), possible moves: down (to 2,0), or right? But (1,0) is on column 0. To the right is (1,1) which is a wall (*). So only down is possible.\n\nSo down to (2,0). Then down to (3,0). Then down to (4,0). Then down to (5,0). Then down to (6,0). Then down to (7,0). Let's check row 7, column 0: o? Row 7 is line 8: \"o*o*o******\". First character is o, yes. So (7,0). From here, down to (8,0). Row 8 is line 9: \"o*o*ooo*ooo\". Column 0 is o. Down to (8,0). Then down to (9,0): row 9 is line 10: \"o***o***o**\". Column 0 is o. Down to (9,0). Then down to (10,0). Now, at (10,0). From here, can move right to (10,1), (10,2), (10,3)? Let's check. The row 10's line is ooo*ooooooX. Columns 0-2: o, column 3: *, so can't go beyond column 2 here. So from (10,0), moving right to (10,1), then (10,2). But then how to get up? Because to reach X at (10,10), need to find a way around the * at column 3. So perhaps this path leads to a dead end here. So maybe this path isn't useful. So perhaps I need to backtrack and try other directions earlier.\n\nLet me backtrack to earlier steps. For example, when I was at (say) (5,0), maybe there's another direction to take instead of continuing down.\n\nAt (5,0): row 5, column 0. What's the surrounding? Let's check the next rows. From here, if I go right? Let me see. From (5,0), can I move right? Let's look at row 5's line: \"o***o******\". So column 0 is o, column 1 is *, so can't move right there. So no. What about moving up? From (5,0), up to (4,0). But that's where we came from. Not helpful. So maybe from (5,0), there's no other way except down. So that path is stuck.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me try starting by moving right first.\n\nFrom (0,0) → right to (0,1). Then maybe continue right. Let's see.\n\nAt (0,1), possible moves: left (back), down, or right. Let's try down.\n\n(0,1) → down to (1,1). But row 1, column 1 is *, which is a wall. Can't go there. So that's invalid. So from (0,1), can't move down. So maybe move right again to (0,2). Then down? Let's check.\n\nAt (0,2), moving down to (1,2). Row 1, column 2 is * (since row 1 is o***o*****o, columns 1-3 are *). So again, wall. Can't go there. So need to move further right.\n\nLet me continue moving right along row 0 until I can go down. For example, from (0,0) go right to (0,4). Let me check. Let's see:\n\nRow 0 is all o's except the first cell. So from (0,0) to (0,4) is possible. Then, from (0,4), can I move down? Let's check row 1, column 4. Row 1's line is o***o*****o. Column 4 is o. So yes. So (0,4) → down to (1,4).\n\nNow at (1,4). Let's check possible moves. From here, can move up (back to 0,4), down to (2,4), left/right.\n\nLet me try down. (1,4) → down to (2,4). Row 2's line is ooo*ooooo*o. Let's check column 4. Row 2: columns 0-2 are o, column 3 is *, columns 4-8 are o, column 9 is *, column 10 is o. So yes, (2,4) is o. Now at (2,4). Possible moves: up, down, left, right.\n\nLet me think. Maybe continue down. From (2,4) down to (3,4). Let's check row 3's line: o*o*******o. Column 4: since row 3 has from column 0: o, *, o, then columns 3-8 are *? Let me parse row 3 again. The line is o*o*******o. Let's break it down:\n\ncolumns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: o. So columns 3-9 are all * except column 10. So (3,4) is *, so can't move there. Therefore, from (2,4), can't move down. So perhaps move right? Let's see. From (2,4), moving right to (2,5), which is o. Then maybe continue right? Let's try that.\n\n(2,4) → right to (2,5). Then right to (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). At (2,8), column 9 is *, so can't go further. From (2,8), can move down? Let's check row 3, column 8: it's * (as per row 3's line). So no. What about moving up? Not helpful. Or left? Maybe. Alternatively, from (2,5) move down if possible. Let me check row 3, column 5: it's * (since row 3 from column 3 onwards are * until column 9). So can't move down. So perhaps from (2,5), need to move right to (2,8) as before. Then perhaps move down from there? No, as said. So maybe this path is stuck. Let me backtrack again.\n\nBack to (2,4). Maybe move up? Back to (1,4). Then maybe move right? From (1,4), can move right? Let's check row 1, columns. At (1,4), row 1's line is o***o*****o. Column 4 is o, column 5 is *, so can't move right. So no. How about left? From (1,4), moving left to (1,3), which is *, blocked. So no. So from (1,4), only up or down. Up is back to (0,4), which we came from. So perhaps need to go back to (0,4) and try another direction.\n\nAt (0,4), possible moves: right (to 0,5), down (already did that to 1,4), or left. Let's try moving right again. From (0,4) → right to (0,5). Then down? Let's check row 1, column 5. It's * (row 1's line is o***o*****o; columns 5-9 are *). So can't move down. So again blocked. So moving further right along row 0 to (0,5), (0,6)... Let's see. Maybe go all the way to (0,10)? But that's the top right. But then need to go down. Let me check.\n\nFor example, from (0,10), can move down to row 1, column 10. Let's check row 1's column 10: it's o. So yes. So (0,10) → down to (1,10). From there, maybe down again. Let's check row 2, column 10: row 2's line ends with o. So yes. Down to (2,10). Then row 3, column 10 is o (row 3's line ends with o). Down to (3,10). Row 4, column 10: row 4's line is o*ooooooo*o → column 10 is o? Let me check. The line is o*ooooooo*o. So column 10 is o? Let me count: the line has 11 characters. The last character is o. Yes. So yes. Continue down to (4,10). Then row 5's line: o***o******. Column 10: let's see, the line is o***o******. It has 5 characters after the initial o***o? Let me count. Original line: o***o****** → o, then three *, then o, then five *? So total length is 1+3+1+5= 10? Wait, no, it should be 11. Let me parse again:\n\nThe line is \"o***o******\" → o, *, *, *, o, *, *, *, *, *, * → that's 1+3+1+5*? Wait, that's 1+3+1+ (five *?), but total is 1+3+1 + 5*? Let me count:\n\nCharacters:\n\n1. o\n2. *\n3. *\n4. *\n5. o\n6. *\n7. *\n8. *\n9. *\n10. *\n11. ?\n\nWait, the line is \"o***o******\". Let me count the characters:\n\no (1), then three * (positions 2-4), then o (position 5), then five * (positions 6-10). So total 1+3+1+5= 10? No, that's 10 characters. But the line should be 11 characters. Oh, maybe there's a typo. Wait, the user provided the maze as:\n\nLine 6: o***o******\n\nWhich is o***o followed by five *? Let me count:\n\nOriginal line: o***o****** → o (1) + *** (3) + o (1) + ***** (5) → total 1+3+1+5= 10. But the maze is supposed to be 11 columns. So perhaps there's a missing character? Or maybe I made a mistake in parsing. Alternatively, maybe the line is o***o*****o? Let me check the original input again.\n\nLooking back at the user's input:\n\nThe sixth line is written as: o***o******. Let me check again. The user wrote:\n\nMaze Board:\nIoooooooooo\no***o*****o\nooo*ooooo*o\no*o*******o\no*ooooooo*o\no***o******\nooo*ooooooo\no*o*o******\no*o*ooo*ooo\no***o***o**\nooo*ooooooX\n\nYes, sixth line is \"o***o******\". So it's o***o followed by five *? Let me count the total length. Let's count the characters:\n\nAssuming that the line is:\n\no * * * o * * * * * → that's 1 + 3 + 5 = 9? No. Wait, maybe there's a typo. Let me count the exact number of characters in that line as written. For example, the line is:\n\no***o****** → let's count each character:\n\n1. o\n2. *\n3. *\n4. *\n5. o\n6. *\n7. *\n8. *\n9. *\n10. *\n11. ?\n\nWait, if it's written as o***o******, then after the 'o***o', there are five *? Let me count:\n\no***o is 5 characters. Then followed by five * would be 5+5=10. But the line needs to be 11 characters. So perhaps there's a missing * or an o? Maybe the sixth line is o***o*****o? Let me check the original input again. The user wrote:\n\nThe sixth line is \"o***o******\". Let me check the original input again. The fifth line is \"o*ooooooo*o\", sixth line is \"o***o******\", seventh line is \"ooo*ooooooo\".\n\nAssuming that the sixth line is 11 characters, perhaps there's a typo. Let me try to count:\n\nFor example, \"o***o******\" has:\n\n- o (1)\n- *** (3)\n- o (1)\n- ***** (5) → total 1+3+1+5= 10. So missing one character. Maybe it's supposed to be o***o*****o? Which would be 11 characters. Let me check. If that's the case, then column 10 of row 5 would be o. Which would allow moving down from (5,10) to next rows. But since the user wrote it as \"o***o******\", I have to assume that maybe there's a mistake in the input, or perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps the sixth line is \"o***o*****o\", which would make it 11 characters. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal line: o***o*****o. That's o, then three *, then o, then five * and then o. So 1+3+1+5+1= 11. Yes. But the user's sixth line is written as \"o***o******\", which is missing the last o? Or maybe there's a typo. This is a problem. Without knowing the exact maze, it's hard to proceed. But since the user provided the sixth line as \"o***o******\", perhaps it's intended to have 11 characters. Let me assume that the line is o***o followed by six *? Let me count:\n\no (1) + *** (3) + o (1) + ****** (6) → 1+3+1+6= 11. Yes. So the sixth line is \"o***o******\" with six * after the o. So the line is o***o****** (total 1+3+1+6= 11). Let me parse that:\n\nRow 5 (sixth line):\n\ncolumns 0: o\n\ncolumns 1-3: *\n\ncolumn 4: o\n\ncolumns 5-10: * (six *). Wait, columns 5-10 is 6 columns. So yes. Therefore, row 5, column 10 is * (wall). Therefore, from (4,10), moving down to (5,10) is a wall. So that path is blocked. So the earlier idea of moving right along the top to (0,10), then down is blocked at row 5, column 10.\n\nThis complicates things. So maybe that path isn't viable.\n\nBack to the earlier path. Let's think again. Maybe there's a way to go down from (2,4) to (2, something else). Let me think. At (2,4), maybe move left? From (2,4), moving up to (1,4), then left? But row 1, column 4 is o. Moving left from there would be to column 3, which is *.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,4), move right to (2,5), then down if possible. Let me check row 3, column 5. Since row 3 is o*o*******o. Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, then columns 3-9: *, column 10: o. So column 5 is *. So can't move down from (2,5) to (3,5). So stuck again.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to backtrack further. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLet me try from (0,0) go right to (0,4), down to (1,4), then right? Let's see. From (1,4), can I move right? Row 1, column 5 is *, so no. How about from (1,4) move up? No, that's back to (0,4). Or left? No. So stuck again.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe from (0,0), move right to (0,3). Let me check. From (0,0) to (0,3) is possible. Then down to row 1, column 3. But row 1, column 3 is * (since row 1's columns 1-3 are *). So can't move down there. So no. How about down to row 1, column 4? Which is o. So from (0,3), move down to (1,4). Which is what I did before. Then same problem.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe find a path that goes through the middle. Let me try to find some other route.\n\nLet me think about row 0. From (0,0), maybe go right to (0,4), down to (1,4), then down to (2,4), then right to (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). From (2,8), can I move down? Let's check row 3, column 8. Row 3's line is o*o*******o. Columns 3-9 are *, so (3,8) is *. No. How about moving up? No. Left? Maybe. From (2,8), move left to (2,7), etc. Not helpful. How about from (2,8) move right to (2,9)? Which is * (row 2's column 9 is *). No. So stuck again.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a way to go from (2,4) to the left? Let me check. From (2,4), moving left to (2,3). But row 2, column 3 is *. Can't go there. Moving left to (2,2), which is o. So yes. How? From (2,4), move left twice to (2,2). But why would I want to go left? Maybe to find another path down.\n\nAt (2,2): o. From there, can I move down? Let's check row 3, column 2. Row 3's line is o*o*******o. Column 2 is o. So yes. So (2,2) → down to (3,2). Now at (3,2). Let's check possible moves. From here, can move up (back), down, left, right.\n\nLet me try down. Row 4, column 2: row 4's line is o*ooooooo*o. Let me parse: column 0 is o, column 1 is *, column 2 is o (since row starts with o*...). So yes, (4,2) is o. So down to (4,2). From there, down to (5,2). Let's check row 5, column 2. Row 5 is o***o******. Columns 0 is o, 1-3 are *, column 4 is o. So column 2 is *, so can't move there. So from (4,2), can't go down. So maybe move right from (4,2). Let's check. From (4,2), row 4's line: columns after 2. Since row 4 is o*ooooooo*o, columns 2-8 are o's? Let me parse:\n\nRow 4: o*ooooooo*o → columns:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: o\n\n4: o\n\n5: o\n\n6: o\n\n7: o\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: o.\n\nSo yes, from (4,2), can move right to (4,3), (4,4), etc. Let's try moving right to (4,8). Then down?\n\nAt (4,8), column 9 is *, so can't move down. From (4,8), can move down? Row 5, column 8: row 5 is o***o******. Columns 5-10 are * (assuming previous analysis). So (5,8) is *. Can't move there. How about moving up? Not helpful. Or left? No. Or maybe move further right? No, because column 9 is *.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,2), move right to (4,4), then down? Let me check. From (4,4), down to row 5, column 4. Row 5, column 4 is o (since row 5 is o***o******, columns 0-3 are *, column 4 is o). So yes. So (4,4) → down to (5,4). Now at (5,4). Let's see. From here, possible moves: up, down, left, right.\n\nLet me try down. Row 6, column 4: row 6 is \"ooo*ooooooo\". Columns 0-2 are o, column 3 is *, columns 4-10 are o. So (6,4) is o. Down to (6,4). From there, can continue down? Row 7: \"o*o*o******\". Column 4: let's see. Row 7: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o? Let me parse the line \"o*o*o******\". It's o, *, o, *, o, followed by five *? Let's count:\n\nColumns:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: *\n\n7: *\n\n8: *\n\n9: *\n\n10: *\n\nSo from (6,4), down to (7,4): which is o. Yes. Now at (7,4). From here, can move down to (8,4). Let's check row 8's line: \"o*o*ooo*ooo\". Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, then columns 4-6: ooo, column 7: *, etc. So (8,4) is o. Down to (8,4). From there, down to (9,4). Row 9: \"o***o***o**\". Let's check column 4. Row 9's line is o***o***o**. Columns 0: o, 1-3: *, column 4: o, then columns 5: *, column 6: *, column 7: o, column 8: *, column 9: *, column 10: *. So (9,4) is o. Down to (9,4). From there, can move down to (10,4). Row 10's line is \"ooo*ooooooX\". Column 4 is o. So yes. Now at (10,4). From here, need to reach (10,10). Let's check the path.\n\nRow 10's line: columns 0-2: o, column 3: *, columns 4-9: o, column 10: X. So from (10,4), can move right through columns 5,6,7,8,9, then to 10. So that's possible. Let's see. From (10,4), move right five times to (10,9), then one more to (10,10) which is X. So this seems like a viable path!\n\nSo let's recap the path taken so far:\n\nStart at (0,0) → right to (0,4) → down to (1,4) → down to (2,4) → left to (2,2) → down to (3,2) → down to (4,2) → right to (4,4) → down to (5,4) → down to (6,4) → down to (7,4) → down to (8,4) → down to (9,4) → down to (10,4) → then right to X.\n\nNow, let's translate these movements into directions. Let me map each step:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (0,4): moving right four times (since from column 0 to 4 is 4 steps right).\n\nBut how did I get from (0,0) to (0,4)? The initial steps were moving right from (0,0) to (0,1), (0,2), etc. So four 'right' moves.\n\nThen down from (0,4) to (1,4): one 'down'.\n\nThen down from (1,4) to (2,4): another 'down'.\n\nNow at (2,4), moving left twice to (2,2): two 'left' moves.\n\nThen down from (2,2) to (3,2): 'down'.\n\nThen down to (4,2): another 'down'.\n\nFrom (4,2), moving right two steps to (4,4): two 'right' moves.\n\nThen down to (5,4): 'down'.\n\nDown to (6,4): 'down'.\n\nDown to (7,4): 'down'.\n\nDown to (8,4): 'down'.\n\nDown to (9,4): 'down'.\n\nDown to (10,4): 'down'.\n\nThen from (10,4), moving right six times to reach (10,10): six 'right' moves.\n\nBut let's count the exact number of steps for each direction. Let me list each move:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nMoves:\n\nright (to 0,1)\n\nright (0,2)\n\nright (0,3)\n\nright (0,4) → four 'right's.\n\ndown (1,4)\n\ndown (2,4) → two 'down's.\n\nleft (2,3)\n\nleft (2,2) → two 'left's.\n\ndown (3,2)\n\ndown (4,2) → two 'down's.\n\nright (4,3)\n\nright (4,4) → two 'right's.\n\ndown (5,4)\n\ndown (6,4)\n\ndown (7,4)\n\ndown (8,4)\n\ndown (9,4)\n\ndown (10,4) → six 'down's (from 5,4 to 10,4: that's 10-5=5 steps down? Wait, from row 5 to row 10 is 5 steps down. Let me recount:\n\nFrom (5,4) to (6,4): down 1.\n\n(6,4) to (7,4): down 2.\n\n(7,4) to (8,4): down 3.\n\n(8,4) to (9,4): down 4.\n\n(9,4) to (10,4): down 5. So five 'down's here.\n\nThen from (10,4) to (10,10): moving right six times (columns 4→5→6→7→8→9→10: six steps).\n\nSo total moves:\n\n['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nBut let me verify the steps again to ensure correctness.\n\nLet me retrace:\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\n1. right → (0,1)\n2. right → (0,2)\n3. right → (0,3)\n4. right → (0,4)\n5. down → (1,4)\n6. down → (2,4)\n7. left → (2,3)\n8. left → (2,2)\n9. down → (3,2)\n10. down → (4,2)\n11. right → (4,3)\n12. right → (4,4)\n13. down → (5,4)\n14. down → (6,4)\n15. down → (7,4)\n16. down → (8,4)\n17. down → (9,4)\n18. down → (10,4)\nThen from (10,4), move right six times to reach X.\n\nYes, steps 13-18 are six 'down's (steps 13 is first, then 14-18 are five more, total six? Wait step 13 is moving from (4,4) to (5,4). Then steps 14-18 are from row 5 to 10: that's 10-5 = 5 steps. So steps 13-18 is six 'down's (including step 13). Yes.\n\nThen from (10,4), six 'right's. So total moves: 4 rights, 2 downs, 2 lefts, 2 downs, 2 rights, 6 downs, 6 rights.\n\nNow, let's check if all these moves are valid and don't hit any walls.\n\nLet me verify some key points:\n\n- From (2,2) down to (3,2): valid as row 3, column 2 is o.\n\n- From (4,2) moving right to (4,4): valid since row 4 allows that.\n\n- From (4,4) down to (5,4): yes, row 5, column 4 is o.\n\n- From (5,4) down to (6,4): row 6, column 4 is o.\n\n- (7,4): row 7, column 4 is o.\n\n- (8,4): row 8, column 4: row 8 is o*o*ooo*ooo. Let me parse row 8: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: *, etc. Yes, (8,4) is o.\n\n- (9,4): row 9's column 4 is o.\n\n- (10,4): row 10's column 4 is o.\n\nThen moving right to (10,10): all columns from 4 to 10 in row 10 are o except column 3 (which is *). So columns 4-9 are o, and column 10 is X. So yes, valid.\n\nSo this path seems valid. Now, translating this into the list of directions.\n\nNow, the list would be:\n\n['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nWait, let's count the steps again:\n\nSteps 1-4: 4 rights.\n\nSteps 5-6: 2 downs.\n\nSteps 7-8: 2 lefts.\n\nSteps 9-10: 2 downs.\n\nSteps 11-12: 2 rights.\n\nSteps 13-18: 6 downs (from 5,4 to 10,4: 6 steps down).\n\nThen steps 19-24: 6 rights.\n\nWait, no. After step 18 (down to (10,4)), then six rights. So steps 19-24: six 'right's.\n\nTotal moves: 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 6 = 24 moves? Let me count:\n\n4 rights (4)\n\nplus 2 downs (6)\n\nplus 2 lefts (8)\n\nplus 2 downs (10)\n\nplus 2 rights (12)\n\nplus 6 downs (18)\n\nplus 6 rights (24).\n\nYes, 24 moves. Now, let's check if there's a shorter path, but since the problem doesn't specify shortest path, just any valid path, this should be acceptable.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any errors in this path.\n\nAnother thing to check is whether the movement from (2,2) to (3,2) is allowed. Yes, because row 3, column 2 is o.\n\nAnother check: from (4,2) to (4,4), moving right two steps. Yes, since row 4 allows that.\n\nAnother check: from (5,4) down to (6,4): row 6's column 4 is o. Yes.\n\nYes, seems okay.\n\nNow, the final answer is a list of directions. Let me write that as:\n\n['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nBut perhaps there's a more optimal path, but this one works. Let me see if there's any mistake in the count of downs from (5,4) to (10,4).\n\nFrom (5,4) to (10,4): rows 5 to 10 is 5 rows down? No, from row 5 to row 10 is 5 steps down (row 5 →6→7→8→9→10: five steps). But in the steps above, I have six 'down's (steps 13-18). Let me recount:\n\nStep 13: from (4,4) to (5,4): down.\n\nStep 14: (5,4) → (6,4): down.\n\nStep 15: (6,4) → (7,4): down.\n\nStep 16: (7,4) → (8,4): down.\n\nStep 17: (8,4) → (9,4): down.\n\nStep 18: (9,4) → (10,4): down. That's 6 steps (steps 13-18: 6 steps). Because step 13 is the first, and steps 14-18 are five more, totaling six. Yes. Because from row 4 to row 10 is 6 steps down (rows 4→5→6→7→8→9→10: 6 steps). So that's correct.\n\nYes, all steps are correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be the list of directions as above.\n ;Answer: ['right','right','right','right','down','down','left','left','down','down','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this maze and find the path from 'I' to 'X'. The maze is 3x3. Let me first visualize it. The rows are:\n\nRow 0: I o o\nRow 1: o * o\nRow 2: o o X\n\nSo the start is at position (0,0). The destination is at (2,2). Let me think about possible paths.\n\nFirst, I can move right or down from the start. Let me check each possibility.\n\nIf I go right first: from (0,0) to (0,1). Then maybe right again to (0,2). From there, can I move down? Let's see. (0,2) down to (1,2) is possible? The cell (1,2) is 'o'? Yes, according to the second row, third column is 'o'. Then from (1,2), moving down to (2,2) would be X. But wait, the third row's third column is X. So that path would be right, right, down, down? Wait, let me check steps:\n\nStart at (0,0). Move right to (0,1). Then right again to (0,2). Then down to (1,2). Then down again to (2,2). That works. But let's check if any of those cells are blocked. The first row is I o o, so (0,1) and (0,2) are o. Second row is o * o: (1,0) is o, (1,1) is *, (1,2) is o. So yes, (1,2) is passable. Third row is o o X. So (2,2) is X. So that path would work. The moves would be 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down'. But wait, the answer needs to be a list of moves. Let me count steps. From start to (0,0). First move right to (0,1) → 'right'. Then right again to (0,2) → another 'right'. Then down to (1,2) → 'down', then down again to (2,2) → another 'down'. So four moves? But maybe there's a shorter path. Let me check another route.\n\nAlternative path: Starting at (0,0), move down to (1,0). Then check possible moves. From (1,0), can I move right? Let's see. The cell (1,0) is o. Moving right would take me to (1,1), which is a wall (X is the destination, but here it's *). So that's blocked. So maybe from (1,0), move down to (2,0). Then from (2,0), which is o, can move right or up? Let's see. From (2,0), moving right to (2,1), then right again to (2,2). That would be X. So the path would be down (to 1,0), then down again to (2,0), then right, right. So moves: down, down, right, right. That's also four steps. Either path works.\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path. Let's see. Let me check if there's a path with three steps. The minimum steps in a 3x3 maze from (0,0) to (2,2) would be 4 moves, because you need to go two steps down and two steps right in some order. So both paths take four steps. Either is acceptable.\n\nSo which one is correct? Let me check if there are any walls blocking. For example, the first path: right, right, down, down. Let me retrace:\n\n(0,0) → right → (0,1) → right → (0,2). Then down to (1,2), then down to (2,2). Correct. The second path is down, down, right, right. (0,0) → down to (1,0), down to (2,0), then right to (2,1), right to (2,2). Also correct.\n\nBut maybe the maze has some restrictions. Are there any walls in these paths? No. Both paths avoid the wall at (1,1). So either path is valid. The problem probably expects one of them. Since the user didn't specify to find the shortest path, but the maze might have only one possible path. Wait, maybe there's another way. Let me check.\n\nAnother possible path: Start at (0,0). Move right to (0,1), then down to (1,1)... Oh no, that's a wall. So that's blocked. So that's invalid. Another possibility: (0,0) → right to (0,1), down to (1,0), then right to (1,1)? No, because (1,1) is a wall. So from (1,0), moving right is blocked. So that's not helpful. So the two paths I found earlier are the possible ones.\n\nSo the answer could be either of those two. Let me pick one. For example, let's take the first path: right, right, down, down. Wait, no. Wait, (0,0) to (0,1) is right. Then (0,1) to (0,2) is right. Then (0,2) to (1,2) is down. Then (1,2) to (2,2) is down. So the moves are ['right', 'right', 'down', 'down'].\n\nAlternatively, the other path is ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right'].\n\nEither is correct. The problem says to output a list of moves. Since there are multiple correct answers, perhaps either is acceptable. Let me check if there's any constraints. The problem says \"output your answer as a list of these strings\". So either path is acceptable.\n\nBut maybe the actual maze requires a specific path. Let me check again. Let me think about the positions:\n\nFirst path:\n\nStart at (0,0). Right to (0,1). Right to (0,2). Down to (1,2). Down to (2,2). So the moves are right, right, down, down.\n\nSecond path:\n\nDown to (1,0), down to (2,0), right to (2,1), right to (2,2). So moves down, down, right, right.\n\nEither is valid. So the answer could be either. Let me pick the first one. So the answer would be ['right', 'right', 'down', 'down'].\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a shorter path. For example, can you go right once, then down, then right, then down? Let me see:\n\nStart at (0,0). Right → (0,1). Down → (1,1). Oh, that's a wall. So that's invalid. So that path is blocked. So no. Another possibility: right, down, right, down. Let's see:\n\nFrom (0,0) → right to (0,1). Then down to (1,1) which is blocked. Can't do that. So that's no good.\n\nAnother path: down once, then right, then down, then right? Let's see:\n\nFrom (0,0) down to (1,0). Then right to (1,1) which is blocked. No good.\n\nSo the only valid paths are the two I found earlier. So the answer is one of those. Let me choose the first path. So the answer would be Answer: ['right','right','down','down'].\n\nAlternatively, the other path is also correct. Maybe the problem expects one of them. Let me check the maze again. The start is at (0,0), and the X is at (2,2). Let me think if there's any other path. For example, maybe a combination of directions. Like down, right, down, right? But from (0,0) down to (1,0). From there, can I go right to (1,1)? No, that's a wall. So no. So that's blocked. So no. So no other paths. So the answer is one of the two.\n\nSo I can choose either. Let me pick the first one. So the answer is ['right', 'right', 'down', 'down'].\n ;Answer: ['right', 'right', 'down', 'down']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this 3x3 maze. Let me first visualize the maze. The input is given as three lines:\n\nFirst line: Ioo\nSecond line: o**\nThird line: ooX\n\nSo the maze looks like this:\n\nRow 0: I o o\nRow 1: o * *\nRow 2: o o X\n\nWait, rows and columns... Let me think of it as a grid. Let's index rows from top to bottom as 0, 1, 2 and columns left to right as 0, 1, 2.\n\nThe starting point 'I' is at (0,0). The destination 'X' is at (2,2). Now, the walls are at positions where there's a '*'. So in row 1, column 1 and 2 are walls. So (1,1) and (1,2) are impassable.\n\nLet me try to map possible paths. Let's think step by step.\n\nFrom the start (0,0), possible moves are down or right. Because up or left would take me out of the maze.\n\nFirst option: move right to (0,1). Then from there, where can I go? (0,1) can go down to (1,1), but that's a wall. Or right to (0,2). Let's try that. So from (0,1) moving right to (0,2). Now at (0,2), possible moves: down to (1,2), but that's a wall. Or right is out of bounds. Or left back to (0,1). So that's a dead end. So maybe from (0,2) we can move down to (1,2), but that's a wall. So that's blocked. So if I take the path right then stuck.\n\nAlternative path from start: down to (1,0). Let's check. (1,0) is 'o' (empty). From there, possible moves: up back to start, down to (2,0), left is invalid (column -1), right to (1,1) which is a wall. So from (1,0), maybe go down to (2,0). Let's go there.\n\nAt (2,0), possible moves: up is back to (1,0), down invalid, left invalid, right to (2,1). So move right to (2,1). Now at (2,1), which is empty. From here, move right again to (2,2), which is X. Success! So that's a possible path.\n\nLet me retrace the steps:\n\nStart at (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,1) → right to (2,2). Wait, but from (2,0), moving right takes me to (2,1), then from there right to (2,2). So the moves would be:\n\nFirst move: down (from (0,0) to (1,0)).\n\nSecond move: down (from (1,0) to (2,0)).\n\nThird move: right (to (2,1)).\n\nFourth move: right (to (2,2)).\n\nSo the list of moves is ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right'].\n\nIs there another path? Let me check. For example, from (0,0) go right to (0,1), then down? Wait, (0,1) is o. Moving down to (1,1) is a wall. Can't. So maybe from (0,1) move right to (0,2). Then from there, can we move down to (1,2)? That's a wall. So no. So that path is stuck. So the only viable path is the one through (1,0), (2,0), then right twice.\n\nAnother possibility: after starting with down to (1,0), then right? (1,0) to (1,1)? But that's a wall. So no. So from (1,0), can't go right. So the only options are down again to (2,0). Then proceed as before.\n\nYes, so the correct path is down twice then right twice. Let me check the positions again:\n\nStart (0,0) → down → (1,0) → down → (2,0) → right → (2,1) → right → (2,2). That's correct. Each step is valid. So the answer should be a list of moves: ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right'].\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. Let me think again. What if from (0,0) go right to (0,1), then down? No, because (1,1) is a wall. From (0,1) can go right to (0,2). Then maybe down to (1,2), but that's a wall. So no. Alternatively, from (0,2) move down to (1,2) which is a wall. No. So stuck. So the only path is the one I found.\n\nSo the answer is the list of moves down, down, right, right. Let me check again. The maze is 3x3. The steps are correct. So the output should be Answer: ['down','down','right','right'].\n ;Answer: ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this maze and find a path from 'I' to 'X'. The maze is 8x8? Let me check the input. The user provided a Maze Board with 8 lines, each line seems to have 8 or 9 characters? Wait, let me count. For example, the first line is \"I*ooooooo\" which is I followed by *, then seven o's? Let me count: I, *, o o o o o o o. That's 1+1+7=9 characters. So each row is 9 characters? But the maze is supposed to be n x n. Wait, maybe there's a typo. Let me check all lines:\n\nFirst line: I*ooooooo → 9 characters. Second line: o*o*****o → o, *, o, *, *, *, *, o → 8 characters? Wait no: o * o * * * * * o → that's o, *, o, then four * and o. Let me count: o (1), * (2), o (3), *, *, *, *, o (total 7? Wait, o*o*****o: that's o * o followed by four * and o? Let me count again: o * o * * * * * o. That's 1. o 2. * 3. o 4. * 5. * 6. * 7. * 8. o. Wait, that's 8 characters? No, wait, the string is written as \"o*o*****o\". Let's break it down:\n\no * o * * * * * o → how many characters? Let's count each symbol:\n\n1. o\n2. *\n3. o\n4. *\n5. *\n6. *\n7. *\n8. *\n9. o? Wait, no. Wait \"*****o\" is five * and then o. Wait original string is \"o*o*****o\". Let me count:\n\nFirst o, then *, then o, then five * (because ***** is five?), then o. So total 1+1+1+5+1= 9 characters. Yes. So each line is 9 characters. So the maze is 9x9? But the user said n x n. Maybe they made a typo? Well, regardless, I need to parse the maze correctly.\n\nSo the maze is 9x9. Let me try to represent it as a grid. The starting point is 'I' and the destination is 'X'. I need to find a path from I to X, moving up, down, left, right, through 'o's and avoiding '*'.\n\nFirst, I need to find where the start and end are. Let's go through each row.\n\nRow 0 (first line): I*ooooooo → So the first cell is I. So position (0,0) is start. Then there's a * at (0,1), then o's from (0,2) to (0,8).\n\nRow 1: o*o*****o → So positions (1,0) is o, (1,1) is *, (1,2) o, then five *s? Let me check. The string is o*o*****o. So positions 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o? Wait, no. Let me count again. The string is o*o*****o. Let's split:\n\nBetween the o and the o at the end, there are five *s? Let me count the * in \"*****\": five. So yes. So positions 3-7 (indices 3 to 7 inclusive) are *.\n\nSo row 1: positions 0 (o), 1 (*), 2 (o), 3 (*), 4 (*), 5 (*), 6 (*), 7 (*), 8 (o). So the end is in the last row. Let's check the last line: ooo*ooooX. Let me check the 9th line (assuming there are 8 lines as per the user's input? Wait, the user's Maze Board has 8 lines? Wait the user wrote:\n\nMaze Board:\nI*ooooooo\no*o*****o\nooooooo*o\no***o*o**\nooo*o*ooo\no********\nooooooo*o\no***o***o\nooo*ooooX\n\nWait, that's 8 lines. So maybe n=8? But each line is 9 characters? That's conflicting. Maybe there's a typo. Let me count the lines again. The user lists 8 lines. Let me check each line's length:\n\nFirst line: I*ooooooo → 9 characters.\n\nSecond line: o*o*****o → 9.\n\nThird: ooooooo*o → 9.\n\nFourth: o***o*o** → let's check. o***o*o** → o, *, *, *, o, *, o, *, * → that's 9? Let me count each character:\n\n1. o\n2. *\n3. *\n4. *\n5. o\n6. *\n7. o\n8. *\n9. * → yes, 9. So that's 9.\n\nFifth line: ooo*o*ooo → o o o * o * o o o → 9.\n\nSixth line: o******** → o followed by eight *? Let's count: o******** is o plus 8 * → 9 characters.\n\nSeventh line: ooooooo*o → same as third line, 9.\n\nEighth line: o***o***o → o***o***o → o, *, *, *, o, *, *, *, o → 9.\n\nWait, but the last line the user wrote is \"ooo*ooooX\". Let me check that. ooo*ooooX → o o o * o o o o X. Let me count: 3 o, 1 *, 4 o, 1 X. That's 3+1+4+1= 9 characters. So yes. So each line is 9 characters. So the maze is 8 rows by 9 columns? Wait no, 8 lines would be 8 rows. So the maze is 8x9? But the user said it's n x n. There's a contradiction here. Maybe there's a mistake in the input? Or perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, the user's Maze Board has 8 lines. Let me recount:\n\n1. I*ooooooo\n\n2. o*o*****o\n\n3. ooooooo*o\n\n4. o***o*o**\n\n5. ooo*o*ooo\n\n6. o********\n\n7. ooooooo*o\n\n8. o***o***o\n\n9. ooo*ooooX?\n\nWait, no. The user's input shows 8 lines? Let me check again. The user wrote:\n\nMaze Board:\n\nI*ooooooo\n\no*o*****o\n\nooooooo*o\n\no***o*o**\n\nooo*o*ooo\n\no********\n\nooooooo*o\n\no***o***o\n\nooo*ooooX\n\nWait, that's 8 lines? No, let me count:\n\nLine 1: I*ooooooo\n\nLine 2: o*o*****o\n\nLine 3: ooooooo*o\n\nLine 4: o***o*o**\n\nLine 5: ooo*o*ooo\n\nLine 6: o********\n\nLine 7: ooooooo*o\n\nLine 8: o***o***o\n\nLine 9: ooo*ooooX\n\nWait, that's 9 lines. Oh! Maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me check again. The user's Maze Board has 9 lines. Each line is 9 characters. So it's a 9x9 maze. That makes sense. So the start is at (0,0) and the end is at (8,8), since the last line's last character is X.\n\nSo the maze is 9x9. Now, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (8,8), avoiding the *s.\n\nLet me try to map out the positions.\n\nLet me note the starting position. The first row is I*ooooooo. So (row 0, column 0) is I. The destination is in row 8, column 8 (last row, last column) as X.\n\nNow, I need to find a path. Let's think about possible algorithms. Since the user wants a path, perhaps BFS is the way to go. But since I'm doing it manually, I need to visualize the maze.\n\nLet me try to sketch the maze mentally.\n\nRow 0: I (0,0), then * at (0,1), then o's from (0,2) to (0,8).\n\nRow 1: [o, *, o, *, *, *, *, *, o]\n\nRow 2: [o, o, o, o, o, o, o, *, o]\n\nRow 3: [o, *, *, *, o, *, o, *, *]\n\nRow 4: [o, o, o, *, o, *, o, o, o]\n\nRow 5: [o, followed by eight *s]\n\nRow 6: [o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, * o? Wait row 6 is \"o********\" → o followed by eight *s. So (5,0) is o, then (5,1) to (5,8) are *.\n\nRow 7: [o, *, *, *, o, *, *, *, o]\n\nRow 8: [o, o, o, *, o, o, o, o, X]\n\nSo the destination is at (8,8).\n\nNow, starting at (0,0). Let's think about possible moves.\n\nFrom (0,0), can we move right? Yes, since (0,1) is *, which is a wall. Wait no! Wait (0,0) is I. The first cell. The next cell to the right is (0,1) which is *, so can't move right. Can we move down? Yes. Because (1,0) is o. So first move is down.\n\nSo step 1: down to (1,0).\n\nFrom (1,0), possible moves: up (back to start), down (to row 2, column 0), left (invalid, since column 0), right (cell (1,1) is *). So down to (2,0).\n\nStep 2: down.\n\nNow at (2,0). From here, what can we do? Let's check row 2: all o's except column 7 (which is *), and column 8 is o. So from (2,0), possible moves: up (to 1,0), down (row 3, column 0: which is o?), looking at row 3: first cell is o. So yes. So step down again?\n\nStep 3: down to (3,0).\n\nFrom (3,0): can we move down again? Row 4, column 0 is o. So step down.\n\nStep 4: down to (4,0).\n\nFrom (4,0): can move down again? Row 5, column 0 is o. Step down.\n\nStep 5: down to (5,0).\n\nNow, row 5, column 0 is o. But row 5 is all * except column 0. So from here, can we move down? Row 6, column 0 is o. Step down.\n\nStep 6: down to (6,0).\n\nFrom (6,0): can move down again? Row 7, column 0 is o. Step down.\n\nStep 7: down to (7,0).\n\nFrom (7,0): can move down again to row 8, column 0. Which is o. Step down.\n\nStep 8: down to (8,0).\n\nNow we're at row 8, column 0. From here, need to move right towards the X. Let's see. The row 8 is: ooo*ooooX. So columns 0-2 are o, then column 3 is *, then columns 4-7 are o, column 8 is X.\n\nSo from (8,0), can we move right? Let's see. So moving right along row 8 until column 2. Let's do that.\n\nSo from (8,0), move right to (8,1). Step 9: right.\n\nThen step 10: right to (8,2). Now at column 2. Can't move further right because column 3 is *.\n\nNow, need to find a way around the * at column 3. Let's think. Since we're at (8,2), perhaps we can move up? Let's check. Moving up from row 8 to row 7, column 2. What's there? Row 7 is \"o***o***o\". Let's parse row 7: columns 0 is o, 1 is *, 2 is *, 3 is *, 4 is o, 5 is *, 6 is *, 7 is *, 8 is o. So at (7,2) is * (wall). Can't move up. So maybe move up isn't possible. What about other directions?\n\nAt (8,2), possible directions: up is blocked, left would take us back, right is blocked by *, so maybe move up from a different position?\n\nHmm, maybe there's a different path. Let me backtrack. Maybe my current approach is leading me into a dead end. Let's think again.\n\nStarting from (0,0) down to (1,0), then down to (2,0)... all the way down to (8,0) is a possible path, but then getting stuck. Perhaps there's a better path earlier.\n\nLet me think again. Starting at (0,0). From there, can't move right (it's *). So down is the only option. So first move is down to (1,0). Now, maybe there's a better path from here. Let's explore other possibilities.\n\nAt (1,0), can we move down to (2,0) as before, or maybe move right? Wait, (1,0) is column 0. Moving right would be to (1,1), which is * (wall). So no. So only down. So proceed as before.\n\nBut when we get to (8,0), we need to find a way to the X. Let's think again. Maybe instead of going all the way down first, there's a way to go right earlier?\n\nWait at row 0, (0,0) can't go right. But (0,2) is o. How do we get there? From (0,0), can't move right, but maybe after moving down and then right?\n\nFor example, starting at (0,0), move down to (1,0), then right? Let's see. From (1,0), can we move right to (1,2)? Because (1,1) is *, so can't move right directly. But maybe down then right?\n\nWait (1,0) can move down to (2,0). Then from (2,0), can we move right? Let's check row 2: ooooooo*o. So columns 0-6 are o, column 7 is *, column 8 is o. So from (2,0), moving right is possible all the way. Maybe instead of going all the way down, explore right?\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's think of possible paths.\n\nAlternative path:\n\nStart at (0,0) down to (1,0), then down to (2,0). From (2,0), maybe move right. Let's say we go right all the way along row 2. For example, from (2,0) to (2, 8). But row 2 is ooooooo*o. So column 7 is *, so can't go to column 7. But column 8 is o. So if we can reach (2,8), maybe that's a way towards the X. Let's see.\n\nSo from (2,0), move right step by step. Let's imagine:\n\nFrom (2,0) right to (2,1), then (2,2)... up to (2,6), then (2,7) is *, so can't. So need to go to (2,6), then maybe move down or up?\n\nWait, perhaps from (2,6), move up to row 1, column 6? Let's check row 1, column 6. Row 1 is o*o*****o. Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o. So column 6 is *; can't move up. So maybe move down from (2,6) to row 3, column 6. Let's check row 3, column 6. Row 3 is o***o*o**. Let me parse row 3: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *. So column 6 is o. So yes, can move down to (3,6). \n\nSo path would be:\n\n(2,0) → right to (2,6) [6 steps right], then down to (3,6). Then maybe from there?\n\nAt (3,6), possible moves: up (to row 2, column 6 which is o), down to row 4, column 6. Let's check row 4, column 6: row 4 is ooo*o*ooo. Columns 0-2: o, o, o; column 3: *; column 4: o; column 5: *; columns 6-8: o, o, o. So column 6 is o. So yes, can move down to (4,6). Then maybe proceed further?\n\nFrom (4,6), can move down to row 5? But row 5 is all * except column 0. So (5,6) is *. Can't go there. So maybe move left or right?\n\nAt (4,6), moving left or right. Let's see. From (4,6), moving left to (4,5) is *, so no. Moving right to (4,7) is o, then (4,8) is o. So perhaps move right to (4,7), then (4,8). From there, maybe move down? But row 5 is blocked except column 0. So can't. Maybe move up? Or find another path.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,6), move up to row 3, column 6. Not helpful. Maybe move left to column 4? Let me check. From (4,6), moving left to column 5 is *, then column 4 is o. Wait, row 4 is ooo*o*ooo. So columns 0-2 are o, column 3 is *, column 4 is o, column 5 is *, columns 6-8 o. So from column 6, moving left past column 5 (which is *), so can't. So only can move right.\n\nSo from (4,6) → right to (4,7), then right to (4,8). Now at (4,8). From here, can we move up? Let's check. Row 3, column 8 is * (row 3 is ... * at column 8). Can't move up. Down is blocked. Left? Yes. But how does that help? Maybe move up to row 2, column 8? Row 2, column 8 is o. From (4,8), move up to (3,8) is *, so no. From (4,8), move up to row 3, column 8 is blocked. So can't. How about moving left along row 4 to column 4?\n\nFrom (4,8), move left to (4,7), then (4,6)... no. Not helpful. Maybe this path isn't working. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that row 5 is mostly blocked except column 0. So perhaps the path must avoid row 5 except column 0. So maybe the earlier path of going down to (5,0) is necessary.\n\nSo backtracking to the initial path: going down to (8,0). Now stuck. Need to find a way from (8,0) to X at (8,8). Let me think again. From (8,0), can I move up? Let's check. Row 7, column 0 is o. So from (8,0), moving up to (7,0). Let's try that.\n\nStep 9: up from (8,0) to (7,0). Now at (7,0). Row 7 is o***o***o. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o.\n\nFrom (7,0), possible moves: down (back to 8,0), up to (6,0), or right? Let's see. Right to (7,1) is *.\n\nSo move up to (6,0). Step 10: up.\n\nAt (6,0). Row 6 is ooooooo*o. So columns 0-7 are o, column 8 is *. Wait, original row 6 is \"ooooooo*o\" → columns 0-6: o, column 7: *, column 8: o? Or maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck the user's input for row 6:\n\nThe sixth line is \"o********\". Wait, no. Let me check again:\n\nThe user's Maze Board lines:\n\nLine 1: I*ooooooo → row 0\n\nLine 2: o*o*****o → row 1\n\nLine 3: ooooooo*o → row 2\n\nLine 4: o***o*o** → row 3\n\nLine 5: ooo*o*ooo → row 4?\n\nWait no. Let me recheck:\n\nThe user's Maze Board:\n\nLine 1: I*ooooooo → row 0\n\nLine 2: o*o*****o → row 1\n\nLine 3: ooooooo*o → row 2\n\nLine 4: o***o*o** → row 3\n\nLine 5: ooo*o*ooo → row 4\n\nLine 6: o******** → row 5\n\nLine 7: ooooooo*o → row 6?\n\nWait no. Let me recheck:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nMaze Board:\n\nI*ooooooo\n\no*o*****o\n\nooooooo*o\n\no***o*o**\n\nooo*o*ooo\n\no********\n\nooooooo*o\n\no***o***o\n\nooo*ooooX\n\nSo line 6 (the sixth line) is \"o********\". Which is row 5? Assuming rows are numbered from 0 to 8. So row 5 is \"o********\", which is o followed by eight *s. So row 5, column 0 is o, columns 1-8 are *.\n\nSo row 6 is \"ooooooo*o\" → which is row 6. So columns 0-6: o, column 7: *, column 8: o.\n\nSo back to being at (6,0). From here, can move right? Let's see. Along row 6, columns 0-6 are o. So from (6,0), moving right all the way to (6,6), then column 7 is *, and column 8 is o. So perhaps move right to (6,8)? Let's try.\n\nFrom (6,0), move right to (6,1), then (6,2)... up to (6,6). Then can we move down? Let's check. From (6,6), moving down to row 7, column 6. Row 7 is o***o***o. Columns 6 is *, because row 7's columns 6 is * (as per earlier analysis). So can't. How about moving up to row 5? But row 5's columns 1-8 are *, so only column 0 is o. So from (6,6), moving up to (5,6) is * (blocked). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,0), move right to (6,7) is *, can't. So move to (6,6), then move right to (6,7) blocked. So maybe from (6,6), move down to row 7, column 6 is * (blocked). Or move up to row 5, column 6 is *.\n\nNot helpful. So perhaps from (6,0), move right to (6,7) is blocked. So maybe another approach.\n\nAt (6,0), maybe move down to row 7, column 0. Which is o. Step: down. So from (6,0) to (7,0). Which is where we were before. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another way. Let's think again. From (8,0), moving up to (7,0), then maybe move right to (7,4)? Because row 7, column 4 is o. Let's see. From (7,0), can we move right past the *s? No. Because columns 1-3 are *s. So can't move directly. So need to find a way around.\n\nPerhaps from (7,0), move up to row 6, column 0. Then move right. Let's try:\n\nFrom (7,0) up to (6,0). Then from (6,0), move right to (6,4), for example. Let's see. From (6,0), move right to (6,4). Then maybe down to row 7, column 4 (which is o). Let's try that.\n\nSo path would be:\n\nAt (6,0) → right to (6,4). Then down to (7,4). From there, maybe proceed further.\n\nAt (7,4), which is o. From there, can we move right? Row 7 is o***o***o. So column 4 is o, column 5 is *, so can't move right. Can we move down to row 8, column 4? Let's check row 8, column 4. Row 8 is ooo*ooooX. Columns 0-2: o, column 3: *, columns 4-7: o, column 8: X. So column 4 is o. Yes. So from (7,4), move down to (8,4). That's possible. \n\nSo let's track this path:\n\nFrom (8,0) → up to (7,0) → up to (6,0) → right to (6,4) → down to (7,4) → down to (8,4).\n\nOnce at (8,4), can move right towards X. From (8,4), move right to (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), then (8,8) which is X. That would work!\n\nLet me verify each step.\n\nStarting from (8,0):\n\nStep 9: up to (7,0)\n\nStep 10: up to (6,0)\n\nNow, from (6,0), need to move right four times to reach (6,4). Steps 11: right, 12: right, 13: right, 14: right. Now at (6,4).\n\nThen step 15: down to (7,4).\n\nStep 16: down to (8,4).\n\nNow at (8,4). From there, move right four times:\n\nStep 17: right → (8,5)\n\nStep 18: right → (8,6)\n\nStep 19: right → (8,7)\n\nStep 20: right → (8,8) which is X. Success!\n\nSo the total path would be:\n\nStart → down (to 1,0) → down (to 2,0) → down to 3,0 → down to 4,0 → down to 5,0 → down to 6,0 → down to 7,0 → down to 8,0 → up to 7,0 → up to 6,0 → right four times → down to 7,4 → down to 8,4 → right four times.\n\nNow let's count the moves and translate them into the required directions.\n\nOriginal path steps:\n\nInitial moves:\n\nFrom (0,0) down to (1,0) → down\n\nThen down to (2,0) → down\n\nDown to (3,0) → down\n\nDown to (4,0) → down\n\nDown to (5,0) → down\n\nDown to (6,0) → down\n\nDown to (7,0) → down\n\nDown to (8,0) → down. So that's 7 down moves from start.\n\nThen from (8,0) up to (7,0): up\n\nThen up to (6,0): up\n\nThen four rights to (6,4): right, right, right, right.\n\nThen down to (7,4): down\n\nThen down to (8,4): down\n\nThen four rights to X.\n\nSo the list of moves would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nWait let me count again:\n\nFrom start to (8,0): how many downs?\n\nStarting at (0,0), to reach (8,0), need to move down 8 times. Because from row 0 to row 8 is 8 steps down. Let's confirm:\n\nRow 0 → down → row 1 (step 1)\n\nRow 1 → down → row 2 (step 2)\n\n...\n\nRow 7 → down → row 8 (step 8). So 8 down moves. Earlier I thought 7, but no, it's 8 steps. Let me recount.\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nStart at row 0. To get to row 8, need 8 down moves. So initial moves are 8 'down's.\n\nThen from (8,0):\n\nup (step 9)\n\nup (step 10)\n\nthen four rights (steps 11-14)\n\nthen down (step 15)\n\ndown (step 16)\n\nthen four rights (steps 17-20).\n\nTotal moves: 8 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 20 moves.\n\nSo the list is:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nLet me verify this path against the maze to make sure there are no walls.\n\nLet me track each position:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nAfter 8 downs:\n\nRow 8, column 0: yes, which is o (since row 8 is ooo*ooooX, column 0 is o).\n\nThen up to (7,0): o (row 7, column 0).\n\nThen up to (6,0): o (row 6, column 0).\n\nThen four rights: column increases by 4 → (6,4). Row 6, column 4 is o (since row 6 is ooooooo*o, columns 0-6 are o).\n\nThen down to (7,4). Row 7, column 4 is o (row 7 is o***o***o → column 4 is o).\n\nThen down to (8,4). Row 8, column 4 is o (as per earlier).\n\nThen four rights to (8,8): columns 5,6,7,8. All are o except column 3 which is *.\n\nYes, columns 4-7 are o, and column 8 is X. So that works.\n\nSo this path is valid.\n\nNow, the user wants the answer as a list of moves: 'up', 'down', etc.\n\nSo the moves are as above.\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path. Maybe there is a more optimal way. For example, perhaps there's a way to avoid going all the way down first. But given the maze structure, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAlternative path: From (0,0) down to (1,0), then maybe find another way. But seems like the only way to proceed is down, since right is blocked.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,0), go right and find a path upwards. For example, from row 2, moving right to some column and then up or down. But I think the path I found is valid and works.\n\nSo the answer would be the list of moves as above.\n\nNow, let me write that list properly.\n\nThe moves are:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nBut let me count the number of each to ensure correctness.\n\nYes, 8 downs initially, then 2 ups, 4 rights, 2 downs, 4 rights. Total 8+2+4+2+4=20 steps.\n\nSo the answer should be this list.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','up','up','right','right','right','right','down','down','right','right','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this maze. The maze is 13x13, I think. Let me first try to visualize the maze.\n\nThe first row is Ioo*ooooooooo. So the starting point is at position (0,0). Let me note down where 'I' and 'X' are. The 'X' is in the last row, somewhere. Let me check the last line: o*ooo*o*ooooX. So row 12 (assuming rows are 0-indexed), the X is at the end, column 12 maybe?\n\nNow, I need to figure out a path. Since the available moves are up, down, left, right, I can't move diagonally. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe using BFS (Breadth-First Search) would be the best way to find the shortest path. But since I'm doing this manually, I need to simulate the process.\n\nFirst, I'll try to map out the positions step by step. Let me start by writing down the coordinates of 'I' and 'X'. \n\nStarting point: 'I' is at (0, 0). The destination 'X' is at (12, 12) perhaps? Let me check the last line again. The last line is o*o*o*o***o**X? Or maybe I need to count the columns. Let me count for the last row:\n\no * o * o * o * * * o ** X. Wait, maybe the exact position is (row 12, column 12). Let me recount. Each row has 13 characters? Let me check the first line: \"Ioo*ooooooooo\" – that's I followed by o o * o o o o o o o o. Let me count:\n\nI (1) o (2) o (3) * (4) o (5) o (6) o (7) o (8) o (9) o (10) o (11) o (12) – wait, maybe each row is 13 characters? Let me check the first line length. Let's see:\n\n\"Ioo*ooooooooo\" – Let's count the letters. I, then o, o, *, then o repeated several times. Let me think: I + 2 o's + * + 8 o's? That would be 1+2+1+8=12? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps each line has 13 characters. Let me check the last line's X position. For example, if the last line ends with \"ooooX\", then maybe the X is at column 12. Let me try to map each row's length. The user provided 13 rows (since the maze is n*n and the example has 13 lines). So n is 13. Each line is 13 characters. So the coordinates go from (0,0) to (12,12).\n\nSo starting at (0,0). Let me look for the path. Let's try to see possible directions. From (0,0), possible moves are down or right? Because up and left would be out of bounds. But looking at the first row:\n\nRow 0: I (0,0), then (0,1) is o, (0,2) is o, (0,3) is *, so to the right of (0,0) is o. But there's a wall at (0,3). So from (0,0), possible moves: right to (0,1), or down to (1,0). Let's check (1,0). The second row is **o*o*******o. So row 1, column 0 is *, which is a wall. Oh wait! So starting at (0,0), moving down to (1,0) would hit a wall. So that's not allowed. Therefore, the first move must be to the right. Wait, but (0,0) can move right to (0,1), which is o. So that's allowed.\n\nSo initial direction: right. Let me try to trace a path.\n\nLet me think step by step. Maybe I can make a grid and track possible steps. But since I can't draw, I'll have to imagine.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let me denote positions as (row, column).\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\nPossible moves: right (to (0,1)), since down (row 1, column 0) is blocked by a wall (as row 1's first character is *).\n\nSo first move: right. Now at (0,1). From here, can I move right again to (0,2)? Yes, since it's o. Then (0,3) is *, so can't go there. So maybe from (0,2), can't go right. So possible directions: down?\n\nLet me check row 1, column 2. Row 1's third character (assuming indexes start at 0). Row 1 is \"**o*o*******o\". Let's parse it:\n\nIndices 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, then a bunch of * and o. So if I'm at (0,2), moving down would take me to (1,2), which is o. So that's allowed. So from (0,2), move down to (1,2). \n\nSo path so far: right, right, down.\n\nNow at (1,2). Let's see. From here, possible moves. Let's check the surrounding cells.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 2 is o. Let's check possible directions. \n\nUp: (0,2) which we came from. Maybe we can go back, but probably better to proceed forward. Let's see. From (1,2), can we move left? Column 1 is *, so no. Left to column 1 is blocked. Right to column 3 is * (from row 1's structure: * * o * o ...). So column 3 is *, so can't go right. Down? Let's check row 2, column 2. Row 2 is \"ooo*ooooooo*o\". Let me parse row 2: first three are o, then *, then o's. So (2,2) is o. So moving down from (1,2) to (2,2) is allowed. \n\nSo path adds 'down' again. Now at (2,2). \n\nFrom (2,2), looking around. Let's check. \n\nRow 2's cells: (2,0)=o, (2,1)=o, (2,2)=o, (2,3)=*, so to the right is blocked. So possible directions: up (back to 1,2), down, left, or maybe other directions. Let me check row 3. Row 3 is \"o*o*o*******o\". So column 2: let's see. Let's parse row 3. Let's index each position:\n\nRow 3: [0] o, [1] *, [2] o, [3] *, [4] o, then a bunch of * and ends with o. So (3,2) is o. So moving down from (2,2) to (3,2) is allowed. So path adds 'down'. \n\nNow at (3,2). \n\nFrom here, check possible moves. Let's see. \n\nLooking at row 3, column 2. Can we move down? Row 4: \"o*ooooooooo*o\". Let me parse row 4. [0] o, [1] *, [2] o, etc. So (4,2) is o. So moving down again. So path adds 'down'. Now at (4,2).\n\nFrom (4,2), possible directions. Let's check. \n\nLooking at row 4. Let's see. Row 4 is o * o * o ... etc. Wait, row 4 is \"o*o*o*******o\"? Wait the original input for row 4 is \"o*ooooooooo*o\"? Wait the user's input for the maze is:\n\nRow 0: Ioo*ooooooooo\n\nRow 1: **o*o*******o\n\nRow 2: ooo*ooooooo*o\n\nRow 3: o*o*o*******o\n\nRow 4: o*ooooooooo*o\n\nRow 5: o*****o******\n\nRow 6: oooooo*ooooo*o\n\nRow 7: o***********o\n\nRow 8: ooooooooooooo\n\nRow 9: o*o*******o**\n\nWait maybe I need to recheck each row's exact characters. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express each row properly.\n\nBut since I can't look back, perhaps I need to proceed carefully. Let me re-express row 4 as given by the user: \"o*ooooooooo*o\". Let me split this into individual characters. Assuming it's 13 characters:\n\no * o o o o o o o o o * o ?\n\nWait let me count:\n\nOriginal string for row 4: \"o*ooooooooo*o\". Let me count the letters:\n\n1. o\n2. *\n3. o\n4. o\n5. o\n6. o\n7. o\n8. o\n9. o\n10. o\n11. o\n12. *\n13. o ?\n\nWait that would be 13 characters. So positions 0 to 12. So row 4, column 0 is o, column 1 is *, column 2 is o, column 3 is o, and so on. Wait, so (4,2) is o. So from (4,2), can I move right? Let's see. Column 3 is o. So moving right is allowed. Maybe that's a better path than going down again. Let me think. \n\nIf I go down from (4,2) to row 5, column 2. Let me check row 5's data. The user's input for row 5 is \"o*****o******\". Let me parse that. Assuming it's 13 characters. Let me split:\n\no followed by five *s, then o, then five *s? So positions:\n\n0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: *, 11: *, 12: * ?\n\nIf so, then (5,2) is *, which is a wall. So moving down from (4,2) to (5,2) is blocked. Therefore, from (4,2), can't move down. So possible directions: up (back to 3,2), left (but column 1 is *?), or right. \n\nLooking at row 4, column 2 is o. To the right (column 3) is o. So moving right. Let's do that. So path adds 'right'. Now at (4,3). \n\nFrom (4,3), can I continue moving right? Let's check. Row 4's columns up to where? The row is \"o*ooooooooo*o\". So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o, 11: *, 12: o. So from (4,3), moving right is allowed until column 10, but column 11 is *.\n\nSo moving right as much as possible. Let's see. From (4,3), moving right step by step. Let me think how far I can go. \n\nAt (4,3), moving right to (4,4), (4,5), etc. Let me try to go as far right as possible. Let's say I go to (4,10). From there, can't go to 11. So perhaps from (4,10), need to move down or up. Let me check row 5 at column 10. \n\nRow 5 is \"o*****o******\". Column 10 is *, so moving down is blocked. So perhaps from (4,10), move up? Let's check row 3, column 10. But that might be in a wall. Alternatively, maybe there's a better path. Let me try to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Let me backtrack a bit. From (4,3), maybe there's a way to go down if possible. Wait, row 5's column 3? Let me check row 5 again. The row is \"o*****o******\". So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, then the rest are *? So column 3 is *, so can't move down there. So from (4,3), can't move down. So perhaps continue moving right until possible.\n\nLet me proceed. From (4,3), moving right to (4,4), then (4,5), (4,6), etc. Let's assume I go all the way to (4, 10). Now, at (4,10), can't move right (column 11 is *). Can I move down? Row 5, column 10 is *, so no. Can I move up? Row 3, column 10. Let me check row 3. Row 3 is \"o*o*o*******o\". Let me parse. Columns:\n\n0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, then followed by *s? Let me think. The original string is \"o*o*o*******o\". So after column 4 (o), there are multiple *s. For example, columns 5-9 are *, and then maybe column 10 is *? So (3,10) is *, so moving up from (4,10) to (3,10) is blocked. So what about left? Moving left from (4,10) back towards earlier columns. Maybe there's a way to go up or down from some position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I took a wrong turn earlier. Let me think again. Maybe there's another path. Let me try to track again.\n\nStarting from (0,0) → right → (0,1) → right → (0,2) → down → (1,2) → down → (2,2) → down → (3,2) → down → (4,2). From (4,2), moving right to (4,3). Now, perhaps from (4,3), moving up? Let me check row 3, column 3. Row 3 is o*o*o... So column 3 is *, so can't move up. So no. So stuck here? Or maybe I need to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,2), maybe instead of moving right, there's another direction. Let me check. From (4,2), can I move down to row 5, column 2? Earlier thought was that row 5, column 2 is *? Let me recheck. Row 5 is \"o*****o******\". Let me parse:\n\nAssuming the string is o followed by five *s, then an o, then five *s? Let me count:\n\nOriginal string: \"o*****o******\" – the first character is o, then five * (total of 1 o and 5 * → 6 characters), then an o, then five * (another 6 characters?), but total length is 13. Let me count:\n\no * * * * * * o * * * * * → that's 1 + 6 + 6? No. Let me think again. The string is \"o*****o******\". The first part is o followed by five * (so o***** is 6 characters), then o followed by five * (another 6), but total would be 12. Maybe there's an extra *? Maybe the actual breakdown is o followed by six *s, then o, then six *s? Let me count the total. Original row is for row 5: \"o*****o******\". Let me count the characters:\n\nAssuming each * is one. Let me write them out:\n\n1. o\n2. *\n3. *\n4. *\n5. *\n6. *\n7. *\n8. o\n9. *\n10. *\n11. *\n12. *\n13. *\nThat's 13 characters. So columns 0: o, 1-6: *, column 7: o, columns 8-12: *. Therefore, column 2 is *, so from (4,2) moving down to (5,2) is blocked. So no. \n\nSo back to (4,2). The only option is to move right. So proceed. From (4,2), moving right to (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (4,10). Now at (4,10). \n\nAt (4,10), possible moves: left, up, down. Let me check. Down is row 5, column 10 which is * (as per row 5's structure). Up is row 3, column 10. Let me check row 3 again. Row 3 is \"o*o*o*******o\". Let me parse column 10. The original string is \"o*o*o followed by several * and ending with o\". Let me think: after column 4 (o), there are multiple *s. Let's say columns 5- maybe up to column 11 are *, and column 12 is o. So column 10 is *. So moving up to (3,10) is blocked. So from (4,10), need to move left. Let's move left back to (4,9), then (4,8), etc. Maybe there's a way down from somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better path earlier. Let me think. Maybe from (4,3), instead of going all the way to (4,10), there's a way to go down at some point. Let me check again. For example, at (4,3), can I move down? Row 5, column 3. As per row 5's structure, columns 0 is o, then columns 1-6 are *, column 7 is o. So column 3 is *, so no. What about column 7? Let me check. If I can reach column 7 in row 4, then maybe move down to row 5's column 7, which is o? \n\nRow 4's column 7 is o. So from (4,3), moving right to (4,7). Let's do that. So moving right four times: (4,3) → (4,4) → (4,5) → (4,6) → (4,7). Now at (4,7). From here, can I move down? Row 5, column 7 is o. Yes! So path adds 'down'. \n\nNow at (5,7). \n\nGreat! Now, from (5,7), what's next? Let me check row 5's structure. Row 5 is \"o*****o******\". So column 7 is o. Let me check surrounding cells. \n\nFrom (5,7), possible directions: up (back to 4,7), down (row 6, column 7). Let me check row 6. The user's input for row 6 is \"ooooo*ooooo*o\". Let me parse it. Assuming it's 13 characters. Let's say:\n\nColumns 0-4: o, column 5: *, columns 6-10: o, column 11: *, column 12: o. So (6,7) is o. So moving down from (5,7) to (6,7) is allowed. So path adds 'down'. \n\nNow at (6,7). \n\nFrom here, let's see. Row 6 is \"ooooo*ooooo*o\". So column 7 is o. Possible moves: up, down, left, right. Let me check. \n\nLooking for a path towards the destination. Let me think. From (6,7), maybe move right? Let's see. Row 6 allows moving right up to column 10 (since column 11 is *). So moving right to (6,10). Let me try that. \n\nFrom (6,7), moving right to (6,8), (6,9), (6,10). Now at (6,10). From here, can't move right (column 11 is *). Can I move down? Row 7, column 10. Let's check row 7's data. The user's input for row 7 is \"o***********o\". So it starts with o, then 11 *s, then o. So column 10 is *, so can't move down. Moving up? Back to row 5, column 10? Let me check row 5's column 10 is * (as discussed earlier). So no. So need to move left or down somewhere else. \n\nAlternatively, from (6,10), maybe move left back to (6,7), then try another direction. Or perhaps move down earlier. Let me think. From (6,7), maybe moving down? Let me check row 7, column 7. Row 7 is \"o***********o\". So column 7 is *, since after the first o, there are 11 *s. So can't move down. So from (6,7), can't move down. What about moving up? Back to (5,7). Or moving left? Let's check. \n\nRow 6, column 7. Moving left would take us to (6,6), which is o. Let me proceed. From (6,7), move left to (6,6). Then maybe continue left? Or other directions. \n\nAlternatively, from (6,7), maybe move up to (5,7) again, but that's where we came from. Let me think of other options. \n\nWait, maybe from (6,7), moving left to (6,6), then up? Let me check row 5, column 6. Row 5 is \"o*****o******\". Column 6 is o. So yes, moving up from (6,6) to (5,6). Wait no: (6,6) is in row 6. To move up would be row 5, column 6. Let me check row 5's column 6: yes, it's o. So from (6,6), moving up to (5,6). \n\nBut how do I get to (6,6)? From (6,7), move left once. \n\nSo path from (6,7) → left → (6,6). Then up to (5,6). Let me check if that's possible. \n\nAt (5,6): yes, it's o. So from there, what's next? \n\nLet me retrace. From (5,7) → up? No, we came from there. Wait, perhaps I need to think of a different path. Maybe from (5,7), instead of going to row 6, go left or right. \n\nAlternatively, from (5,7), moving left to (5,6), (5,5)... but row 5's columns 1-6 are * except column 0 and 7. Let me check. Row 5: columns 0 is o, 1-6 are *, column 7 is o. So from (5,7), moving left would hit *s until column 7. So can't move left. So only options are down (to row 6, column 7) or right. \n\nSo back to (6,7). Let me try moving right to (6,10) as before. Now at (6,10). From here, need to find a way. Let me check row 6's column 10: it's o (since row 6 is ooooo*ooooo*o. Column 10 is o before the * at column 11). So from (6,10), can I move down? Row 7, column 10 is *, so no. Can I move up? Row 5, column 10 is * (as discussed earlier). So no. So need to move left. Let me move left back to (6,7). Not helpful. Maybe there's another way. \n\nLet me think. Perhaps from (6,7), instead of going all the way right, I should go in another direction. Let me check other possibilities. \n\nAt (6,7), maybe move up to (5,7), then right? But row 5, column 7 is o. From there, can I move right? Let's check row 5's columns. From column 7 onwards: column 7 is o, columns 8-12 are *s. So can't move right. So stuck again. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to backtrack further. Let me think where I was before. Earlier steps were:\n\nStart → (0,0) → right → (0,1) → right → (0,2) → down → (1,2) → down → (2,2) → down → (3,2) → down → (4,2) → right → (4,3)... and so on. Maybe there's a different path earlier. Let me try to see if there's another way from (2,2). \n\nAt (2,2), maybe instead of going down to (3,2), I could move left or right? Let me check. From (2,2), row 2 is ooo*... So columns 0-2 are o, column 3 is *. So moving left to (2,1), then (2,0)? Let me try that. \n\nSo from (2,2), move left to (2,1), then left to (2,0). From (2,0), can I move down? Row 3, column 0 is o. So yes. \n\nLet me try this alternative path. \n\nOriginal path up to (2,2). Now, instead of going down to (3,2), go left twice to (2,0). Then down to (3,0). \n\nRow 3, column 0 is o. From there, can I move down? Row 4, column 0 is o. So yes. \n\nSo path would be: from (2,2) → left → left → down → down... \n\nLet me try this. Let's retrace:\n\nStart → right → right → down → down → down → at (2,2). Now, left, left → (2,0). Then down to (3,0). From there, down to (4,0). Let me check row 4, column 0 is o. From there, can I move right? Let's see. \n\nAt (4,0), moving right to (4,1) is *, so no. So need to move down. Row 5, column 0 is o (row 5 starts with o). So down to (5,0). From there, can move down again? Row 6, column 0 is o. Down to (6,0). From there, row 7, column 0 is o. Down to (7,0). Now, row 7 is \"o***********o\". So column 0 is o, but columns 1-11 are *. So from (7,0), can't move right except to column 12. Let me check row 7's column 12 is o. So from (7,0), need to move down? But row 8 is next. Let me check row 8's data. The user's input for row 8 is \"ooooooooooooo\". So all o's. So from (7,0), moving down to (8,0). From there, can move right freely. \n\nThis seems promising. Let me try to outline this path. \n\nSo, from (4,0) → down to (5,0) → down to (6,0) → down to (7,0) → down to (8,0). Now at (8,0). \n\nFrom (8,0), since row 8 is all o's, I can move right as much as needed. Let me try to reach the destination. \n\nThe destination is at (12, 12). So from (8,0), moving right to (8,1), (8,2)... all the way to (8, 12). Then down through rows 9, 10, 11, 12 to reach (12,12). But need to check if the path is open. \n\nLet me check row 9. The user's input for row 9 is \"o*o*******o**\". Let me parse it. Assuming it's 13 characters. Let me think: o * o followed by several * and ending with o **? So for example, columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, then more *s? Not sure. But if I'm moving from (8,12) up to row 9, column 12. Let me check if that's passable. \n\nBut let's proceed. From (8,0), moving right to (8,12). Then down to row 9, column 12. Let me check row 9's column 12. The row is \"o*o*******o**\". Let me count column 12. Assuming the last two are *s. So column 12 is *. So can't go there. So need to adjust. \n\nPerhaps from row 8, moving up to certain points? Or find another way. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, from (8,0), move right to column 2, then down to row 9, column 2. Let me check row 9's column 2 is o? The row is \"o*o*******o**\". Column 0: o, 1: *, 2: o. Yes. So from (8,2), moving down to (9,2). \n\nSo let me adjust. From (8,0), move right to (8,2). Then down to (9,2). \n\nRow 9, column 2 is o. From there, can I move right? Let me check row 9's columns. After column 2 (o), column 3 is *, so can't move right. So need to move down. Row 10, column 2. Let me check row 10's data. User input for row 10 is \"o*o*ooooo*ooo\". Let me parse. Assuming it's o * o * o o o o o * o o o. So column 2 is o. So moving down to (10,2). \n\nFrom (10,2), can I move down again to (11,2)? Let me check row 11. User input for row 11 is \"o*o*o*o***o**\". Let me parse. Column 2 is o? Let me think: row starts with o * o * o * o * * * o * *. So column 2 is o. So yes. Down to (11,2). \n\nFrom (11,2), down to (12,2). Let me check row 12's data. It's the row with X at the end. Row 12 is \"o*ooo*o*ooooX\". Let me parse. Column 2 is o. So (12,2) is o. From there, need to move right through columns. \n\nBut there are walls in row 12. Let me check. Row 12's columns:\n\n0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o, 11: o, 12: X. \n\nSo from (12,2), moving right through columns 3,4 (which are o), then hit * at column 5. So need to find a way around. Let me think. \n\nFrom (12,2), move right to (12,3), then (12,4). At (12,4), can't go further right. Need to find a way up or down. But down is out of bounds. So need to move up. Let me check if there's a path upwards from here. \n\nFrom (12,4), move up to (11,4). Let me check row 11's column 4. Row 11 is \"o*o*o*o***o**\". Let's parse: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, ... So column 4 is o. From (11,4), can I move up to (10,4)? Let's check row 10's column 4. Row 10 is \"o*o*ooooo*ooo\". Columns: 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o, 11: o, 12: o. So yes, column 4 is o. \n\nFrom (10,4), move up to (9,4). Let me check row 9's column 4. Row 9 is \"o*o*******o**\". Column 4: after column 2 (o), column 3 is *, so column 4 is *? So can't move there. So stuck. Need to find another way. \n\nHmm. Maybe from (12,4), instead of moving up to (11,4), move left back to (12,2), then find another route. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, from (12,2), maybe there's a way to go through columns that aren't blocked. Let me look at row 12 again. The X is at column 12. To get there, need to pass through columns that are o. Let me see the path from (12,2) to (12,12):\n\nColumns 2: o → 3: o → 4: o → 5: * → 6: o → 7: * → 8: o → 9: o → 10: o → 11: o → 12: X. \n\nSo the path is blocked at 5 and 7. So perhaps from (12,4), need to go up to a row where there's a path around the *s. \n\nLet me try from (12,4) up to (11,4), then right? Let me check row 11, column 4 is o. From there, can I move right? Row 11's column 5 is * (from earlier parsing). So no. Need to move up again. From (11,4) up to (10,4), then right? Row 10, column 4 is o. From there, can I move right to (10,5)? Yes, since row 10's column 5 is o. \n\nSo from (10,4) → right to (10,5). Then continue right to (10,8) perhaps? Let me check row 10: columns 4 is o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, then column 9 is *? Row 10 is \"o*o*ooooo*ooo\". Let me recheck. Assuming the structure is o * o * o o o o o * o o o. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o, 11: o, 12: o. \n\nSo from (10,5) to (10,8) is allowed. From (10,8), can't move right to column 9 (*). So from (10,8), move up to (9,8). Let me check row 9's column 8. Row 9 is \"o*o*******o**\". Let me parse. After column 2 (o), columns 3-... are *s until the end? Let me think: row 9 is o * o followed by several * and ending with o **. Assuming columns 3-8 are *, so (9,8) is *. Can't move there. So stuck again. \n\nHmm. Maybe from (10,8), move down to (11,8). Let me check row 11's column 8. Row 11 is \"o*o*o*o***o**\". Let me parse. Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o, 11: *, 12: *. So column 8 is o. Yes! So from (10,8), move down to (11,8). \n\nNow at (11,8). From here, can I move down to (12,8)? Yes, since row 12's column 8 is o. Now at (12,8). From here, move right to (12,9), (12,10), (12,11), then (12,12) which is X! \n\nYes! So this seems to work. Let me recap this path:\n\nFrom (12,2) → right to (12,4) → up to (11,4) → up to (10,4) → right to (10,5) → right to (10,8) → down to (11,8) → down to (12,8) → right to X. \n\nSo integrating this into the earlier path:\n\nThe earlier path was:\n\nStart → ... → (8,0) → right to (8,2) → down to (9,2) → down to (10,2) → down to (11,2) → down to (12,2). Then the above steps.\n\nSo combining all, the full path would be:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nMove right → (0,1)\n\nMove right → (0,2)\n\nMove down → (1,2)\n\nMove down → (2,2)\n\nMove left → (2,1)\n\nMove left → (2,0)\n\nMove down → (3,0)\n\nMove down → (4,0)\n\nMove down → (5,0)\n\nMove down → (6,0)\n\nMove down → (7,0)\n\nMove down → (8,0)\n\nMove right → (8,1)\n\nMove right → (8,2)\n\nMove down → (9,2)\n\nMove down → (10,2)\n\nMove down → (11,2)\n\nMove down → (12,2)\n\nMove right → (12,3)\n\nMove right → (12,4)\n\nMove up → (11,4)\n\nMove up → (10,4)\n\nMove right → (10,5)\n\nMove right → (10,6)\n\nMove right → (10,7)\n\nMove right → (10,8)\n\nMove down → (11,8)\n\nMove down → (12,8)\n\nMove right → (12,9)\n\nMove right → (12,10)\n\nMove right → (12,11)\n\nMove right → (12,12) → X.\n\nNow, converting these moves into directions. Let's track each step's direction.\n\nFrom (0,0) to (0,1): right\n\n(0,1) to (0,2): right\n\n(0,2) to (1,2): down\n\n(1,2) to (2,2): down\n\n(2,2) to (2,1): left\n\n(2,1) to (2,0): left\n\n(2,0) to (3,0): down\n\n(3,0) to (4,0): down\n\n(4,0) to (5,0): down\n\n(5,0) to (6,0): down\n\n(6,0) to (7,0): down\n\n(7,0) to (8,0): down\n\n(8,0) to (8,1): right\n\n(8,1) to (8,2): right\n\n(8,2) to (9,2): down\n\n(9,2) to (10,2): down\n\n(10,2) to (11,2): down\n\n(11,2) to (12,2): down\n\n(12,2) to (12,3): right\n\n(12,3) to (12,4): right\n\n(12,4) to (11,4): up\n\n(11,4) to (10,4): up\n\n(10,4) to (10,5): right\n\n(10,5) to (10,6): right\n\n(10,6) to (10,7): right\n\n(10,7) to (10,8): right\n\n(10,8) to (11,8): down\n\n(11,8) to (12,8): down\n\n(12,8) to (12,9): right\n\n(12,9) to (12,10): right\n\n(12,10) to (12,11): right\n\n(12,11) to (12,12): right\n\nNow, compiling all these directions into a list:\n\n['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nLet me count the number of steps to ensure it makes sense. From start to finish, this seems plausible. Let me check if there are any errors in the directions.\n\nFor example, from (2,2) to (2,1): left. Correct.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (2,0): left. Correct.\n\nDown to (3,0): down. Correct.\n\nAnd so on. The steps seem to follow correctly. Now, let me verify if this path actually avoids all walls. \n\nFor example, when moving from (8,0) to (8,2), row 8 is all o's, so right moves are allowed. \n\nWhen moving down from (8,2) to (9,2), row 9's column 2 is o. Yes. \n\nFrom (10,2) down to (11,2): row 10's column 2 is o, row 11's column 2 is o. \n\nFrom (11,2) down to (12,2): row 12's column 2 is o. \n\nThen moving right to (12,4): allowed since those are o's. \n\nUp to (11,4): row 11's column 4 is o. \n\nUp to (10,4): row 10's column 4 is o. \n\nRight to (10,8): allowed as discussed. \n\nDown to (11,8): allowed. \n\nDown to (12,8): allowed. \n\nRight to X: yes. \n\nThis seems valid. Therefore, the answer should be the list of these directions.\n ;Answer: ['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']"

      "Okay, let's try to figure out the path through this maze. First, I need to visualize the maze based on the given input. The maze is 7x7, right? Let me write it down row by row to get a clearer picture.\n\nRow 0: I o o o o * o  \nRow 1: o * * * * * o  \nRow 2: o o o o o o o  \nRow 3: o * o * o * *  \nRow 4: o * o * o o o  \nRow 5: o * * * o * o  \nRow 6: o o o * o * X  \n\nSo the starting point 'I' is at position (0,0). The destination 'X' is at (6,6). Now, I need to find a path from start to end, moving only through 'o's and avoiding 'X's. The allowed moves are up, down, left, right. Let me think about possible paths.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's see the possible first moves. From (0,0), can I move right or down? Let's check:\n\n- Moving right to (0,1): that's 'o', which is allowed.\n- Moving down to (1,0): that's 'o', also allowed.\n\nSo maybe there are multiple paths, but I need to find one. Let me try to explore step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe moving down to row 1, column 0. Let's see. From (0,0) down to (1,0). Row 1, column 0 is 'o'. Then from there, what can I do? Let's look at row 1. The row is o followed by five '*' and then o. So row 1, column 0 is o, but moving right along row 1, columns 1-5 are all walls. So from (1,0), possible moves: can I go down to row 2, column 0? Let's check row 2, column 0: it's 'o'. So yes. So moving down again. Now at (2,0). From here, maybe move right? Because row 2 is all 'o's. Let's see. Row 2: o o o o o o o. So from (2,0), moving right all the way. Let me think. But how does that help me reach the destination?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better path. Let me think again. Let's try the first approach.\n\nStart at (0,0). Move down to (1,0). Then down to (2,0). Then from (2,0), maybe move right. Let's see. Let's go all the way right along row 2. For example, from (2,0) moving right to (2,1), (2,2)... up to (2,6). Because row 2 is all 'o's. Then from (2,6), perhaps move down. Let's check the next rows.\n\nRow 3: column 0 is 'o', then column 1 is '*', column 2 is 'o', column 3 is '*', column 4 is 'o', column 5 is '*', column 6 is '*'. So from (2,6), moving down to row 3, column 6 would be a wall. So can't go there. So maybe from (2,6), move down to row 3, column 6? No. Wait, row 3, column 6 is '*'. So maybe from (2,6), move left? Or perhaps from row 2, go to column 4 or 5?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from row 2, column 6, moving down to row 3, column 6 is blocked. So maybe from row 2, column 5? Let me think. Wait, row 2 is all 'o's. So (2,6) is the end. From there, moving down to row 3, column 6 is blocked. So perhaps from (2,6), move left to (2,5). Then down to row 3,5? Let me check row 3, column 5: it's '*'. So no. So maybe from (2,5), move down to row 3,5? Which is a wall. Not allowed. So that's a dead end. Hmm. Maybe this path isn't working. Let me backtrack.\n\nAlternative approach: from (2,0), instead of going all the way right, maybe find a way that connects to other parts. Let's think. From (2,0), moving right to (2,1), then maybe down? Let me check. Let's try to find a path from row 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial move should be to go right first. Let's try that. Starting at (0,0). Move right to (0,1). Then right again to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4). But row 0 has a '*' at position 5 (since the first row is I o o o o * o). So position (0,5) is '*', so can't go there. So from (0,4), moving right to (0,5) is blocked. So maybe from (0,4), move down to row 1, column 4? Let's check row 1, column 4: it's '*'. So that's blocked. Hmm. So moving right from start may not be the best. So maybe the first move down is better.\n\nBack to the first approach. Starting at (0,0) down to (1,0), then down to (2,0). From there, moving right. Let me think again. Let's try to find a path from (2,0). Suppose I go right to (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). Now at (2,6). From here, can't go down. Let's see. How to get further. Maybe from (2,6), move up? No, already at row 2. Left? Let's try moving left to (2,5). Then down to row 3, column 5? But row 3, column 5 is '*'. No. How about moving down from (2,4)? Let me think. Suppose I don't go all the way to column 6. Let's say I stop at column 4. From (2,4), moving down to row 3, column 4. Row 3, column 4 is 'o'? Let me check the third row: o * o * o * *. So row 3 (assuming rows are 0-based?), yes. So row 3, column 4 is 'o'. So yes. So from (2,4) down to (3,4). Then from (3,4), what can I do? Let's look. Row 3, column 4 is o. Then, moving right would take me to (3,5), which is '*', blocked. Moving left to (3,3)? Which is '*'. Also blocked. Moving down to (4,4)? Let's check row 4. Row 4 is o * o * o o o. So column 4 is 'o'? Let me check. Row 4 columns:\n\n0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o. Yes. So (4,4) is o. So from (3,4), moving down to (4,4). Now at (4,4). From here, possible moves. Let's see. Moving right to (4,5) and (4,6). Then maybe from there down? Let's see. From (4,4), moving right to (4,5) (o), then to (4,6) (o). Then down to row 5, column 6? Let's check row 5: columns 5 is * and column 6 is o. Wait, row 5 is o * * * o * o. So row 5, column 6 is o. But from (4,6), moving down to (5,6) would be allowed. Let's try.\n\nSo path so far: start (0,0) down to (1,0) down to (2,0) right to (2,4) down to (3,4) down to (4,4) right to (4,5), (4,6), then down to (5,6). Then from (5,6), need to get to (6,6). But (5,6) is already o, and (6,6) is X. So from (5,6), moving down to (6,6) would reach the destination. That seems possible. Let me check the steps again.\n\nLet me map out the coordinates:\n\nStart at (0,0). Move down to (1,0): that's one move down.\n\nThen down again to (2,0): another down.\n\nNow, from (2,0), moving right four times to reach (2,4). So four 'right's.\n\nThen down to (3,4): one down.\n\nThen down to (4,4): another down.\n\nFrom (4,4), moving right two times to (4,5) and (4,6): two rights.\n\nThen down to (5,6): one down.\n\nThen down again to (6,6): another down.\n\nSo the moves would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']\n\nWait, let's count:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): down.\n\n(1,0) to (2,0): down.\n\n(2,0) to (2,1): right.\n\n(2,1) to (2,2): right.\n\n(2,2) to (2,3): right.\n\n(2,3) to (2,4): right. So four 'right's.\n\nThen down to (3,4): down.\n\nThen down to (4,4): down.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (4,5): right.\n\n(4,5) to (4,6): right. Two rights.\n\nThen down to (5,6): down.\n\nThen down to (6,6): down. So that's two downs here.\n\nTotal moves: 2 downs, 4 rights, 2 downs, 2 rights, 2 downs. Let me list them as a sequence:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']\n\nBut let me check if that's correct. Let me verify each step.\n\nStart at (0,0):\n\n1. down → (1,0)\n2. down → (2,0)\n3. right → (2,1)\n4. right → (2,2)\n5. right → (2,3)\n6. right → (2,4)\n7. down → (3,4)\n8. down → (4,4)\n9. right → (4,5)\n10. right → (4,6)\n11. down → (5,6)\n12. down → (6,6)\n\nYes, that works. Let me check each cell's validity:\n\n(1,0): o (row 1, column 0)\n(2,0): o (row 2, column 0)\n(2,1-4): all o's (row 2)\n(3,4): o (row 3, column 4)\n(4,4): o (row 4, column 4)\n(4,5): o (row 4, column 5)\n(4,6): o (row 4, column 6)\n(5,6): o (row 5, column 6)\n(6,6): X. Correct.\n\nSo that's a valid path. But let me check if there's a shorter path. Maybe there's another way. Let me think. For example, from (0,0), maybe moving right then down, but earlier steps had issues. Let me try another possible route.\n\nAlternative path: Starting at (0,0). Move right to (0,1). Then down to (1,1). But row 1, column 1 is '*' (since row 1 is o followed by five * and then o). So that's a wall. Can't go there. So that's blocked. So that path is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: From (0,0), move right to (0,1), then right again to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4). From (0,4), can I move down? Let's check. (0,4) is row 0, column 4. Down to row 1, column 4. But row 1, column 4 is '*' (since row 1 is o * * * * * o — columns 0 is o, then columns 1-5 are *, and column 6 is o). So column 4 in row 1 is *, blocked. So can't move down there. So from (0,4), maybe move right? To (0,5) which is *, blocked. So no. So that's a dead end. So initial approach seems better.\n\nAnother possible path: From (2,0), maybe move up? No, already at row 2, moving up would be row 1, column 0 which is allowed but we came from there. Not helpful. So probably the first path is valid.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way. For example, from row 2, column 0, moving right to column 0- maybe go up? No. So perhaps the first path is the correct one.\n\nSo the answer would be the list of moves as described. Let me translate those steps into the required direction strings.\n\nThe sequence is:\n\ndown, down, right, right, right, right, down, down, right, right, down, down.\n\nSo the list would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']\n\nBut let me check again if there's a shorter path. For example, maybe from row 2, instead of going all the way to column 4, perhaps there's a way to go earlier down. Let me think. For example:\n\nFrom (2,0), move down to row 3, column 0. Let's check. Row 3, column 0 is 'o'. So yes. So maybe:\n\nStart at (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → down to (3,0). Then from (3,0), which is o, can move right? Let's see. Row 3 is o * o * o * *. So column 0 is o, column 1 is *, column 2 is o. So from (3,0), can move right to (3,1) which is blocked. So can't. So maybe move up? No. Or move right to column 0? No. Wait, from (3,0), moving right to column 1 is blocked. So perhaps from (3,0), move down to row 4, column 0. Row 4, column 0 is o. So yes. Then from (4,0), which is row 4, column 0. From there, moving right? Let's see. Row 4 is o * o * o o o. So column 0 is o, column 1 is *, column 2 is o, etc. So from (4,0), move right to (4,1) is blocked. So maybe move right to column 2? Wait, can't move right from (4,0) to (4,1) because it's blocked. So how to get to column 2? Maybe move up to row 3, column 0 again, then right to column 2? Not helpful. So perhaps this path is not better. So maybe the original path is better.\n\nTherefore, the initial path seems valid. Let me confirm once more.\n\nYes, the steps are correct. So the answer is the list of moves as I outlined.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','right','right','right','right','down','down','right','right','down','down']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this 7x7 maze. The maze is given as rows of characters. Let me first write down the maze to visualize it better. \n\nThe maze is:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o * o\nRow 1: o * * * * * o\nRow 2: o o o * o o o\nRow 3: * * o * * * o\nRow 4: o * o o o o o\nRow 5: o * o * * * o\nRow 6: o o o o o * X\n\nSo each row is a string. Let's note the positions of 'I' and 'X'. The start 'I' is at (0,0). The destination 'X' is at (6,6). \n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (6,6), moving only through 'o's (and the start and end points). The available moves are up, down, left, right. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nProbably, a BFS (Breadth-First Search) approach would be good here since it can find the shortest path. But since I'm doing this manually, maybe I can trace the path step by step.\n\nLet me first map the positions. Let's index rows from 0 to 6 and columns 0 to 6.\n\nStart at (0,0). Let's look for possible moves. From (0,0), possible directions:\n\n- Right: (0,1) is 'o', so possible.\n- Down: (1,0) is 'o', so possible.\n\nSo two options. Let me try exploring each path.\n\nFirst, maybe I can sketch the maze and mark possible paths.\n\nLooking at row 0: I (start) then o o o o * o. So columns 0-6. The fifth position (index 5) is *, so up to column 4 is okay.\n\nRow 1: column 0 is o, but then columns 1-5 are *, and column 6 is o. So from row 1, column 0 is o but row 1, column 1 is a wall. So if I go down to (1,0), from there, can I move? Let's see. From (1,0), possible moves:\n\n- Up: can't, since row 0 is the top.\n- Down: row 2,0? Let's check row 2, column 0: it's 'o' (row 2: o o o * o o o). So yes. So down to (2,0).\n- Right: (1,1) is *, wall. So no. Left can't since column 0.\n\nSo from (1,0), can go down to (2,0). Let's see if that's a viable path.\n\nAlternatively, starting by moving right from the initial position.\n\nStarting path: Let's consider possible paths.\n\nLet me try to find a path step by step.\n\nOption 1: Start at (0,0). Let's go right to (0,1), then maybe further right?\n\nBut row 0, columns 0-4 are passable. Let's see. But row 1 has a lot of walls. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: Let's mark the position of X at (6,6). Let's see how to reach there. Looking from the end. The cell before X is (6,5), which is 'o'. Then from (6,5), how to get there. Let me see if there's a path from (6,5) to start.\n\nBut maybe that's harder. Let's try forward.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let me try moving down first. Let's try:\n\n(0,0) → down to (1,0). Then down to (2,0). From (2,0), possible moves. Let's check row 2: o o o * o o o. So columns 0-2 are o, column 3 is *, then columns 4-6 are o.\n\nFrom (2,0), can move right to (2,1), (2,2), etc., or down to (3,0). But row 3, column 0 is * (wall). So can't go down from (2,0) to row 3. So from (2,0), can go right or up (but up is (1,0) which is where we came from). So let's explore right.\n\nSo path so far: down, down. Then maybe right.\n\nLet me think. Let's try to go right as much as possible. For example:\n\n(0,0) → right to (0,1) → right to (0,2) → right to (0,3) → right to (0,4). Now at (0,4). From here, can't go right because (0,5) is *. So options: down, left, or up (but up is outside). Let's try down. (0,4) down to (1,4). But row 1, column 4 is *? Let me check row 1: o followed by five * and then o. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o. So (1,4) is *. Can't go there. So moving down from (0,4) is blocked. So maybe from (0,4), try down to row 1, column 4 is blocked. So perhaps left? But came from left. Hmm. So maybe that path is a dead end. So perhaps moving down from start is better.\n\nLet me backtrack. Starting at (0,0), go down to (1,0). Then down to (2,0). From (2,0), go right to (2,1), then right to (2,2). Now at (2,2). From here, can we move down? Row 3, column 2 is 'o' (row 3: **o***o). So row 3, column 2 is o. So yes. So down to (3,2). Now at (3,2). From here, possible moves: right? (3,3) is * (since row 3 is * * o * **, so column 3 is *). So can't go right. Left to (3,1) which is *, can't. Up is (2,2) where we came from. Or down to (4,2). Let's check row 4, column 2: row 4 is o * o o o o o. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o. So yes, (4,2) is o. So down to (4,2). \n\nSo path so far: down, down, right, right, down, down? Wait, let me track the moves:\n\nOriginal position (0,0). Move down → (1,0). Move down → (2,0). Move right → (2,1). Move right → (2,2). Move down → (3,2). Move down → (4,2). Now at (4,2). \n\nFrom (4,2), possible directions. Let's look. Row 4 is o * o o o o o. So column 2 is o. Let's check surrounding cells. From (4,2), can we move up (back to (3,2)), left (column 1 is *, blocked), down to (5,2). Let's check row 5, column 2: row 5 is o * o * * * o. So column 2 is o. So yes. So move down to (5,2). \n\nNow at (5,2). From here, possible moves. Let's check. Row 5, column 2 is o. Can we move up? (4,2) is where we came from. Can move right? (5,3) is * (since row 5: columns 3-5 are *). Left? (5,1) is *, no. Down to (6,2). Row 6 is o o o o o * X. So column 2 is o. So yes. Move down to (6,2). \n\nNow at (6,2). From here, need to get to (6,6). Let's see. The path from (6,2) to (6,6) would need to go right through columns 3,4,5,6. But column 5 is * (row 6: columns 5 is *). So columns 6 is X. Let me check row 6: columns 0-4 are o, column 5 is *, column 6 is X. So from (6,2), can move right to (6,3), (6,4), then (6,5) is *, so can't go further. Wait, but (6,5) is *, so from (6,4), can't go to (6,5). So need another way. Maybe up?\n\nAt (6,2), perhaps move up? Let's see. From (6,2), moving up would take us to (5,2), which is where we came from. So maybe need another path.\n\nHmm. So maybe this path hits a dead end here. Let me think. How to get from (5,2) to somewhere else. From (5,2), maybe move right? But (5,3) is *.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,2), maybe there's another direction. Let's see. At (4,2), perhaps move right? Let's check. (4,3) is o? Row 4: columns 0 is o, 1 is *, 2 is o, 3 is o, etc. Yes, so (4,3) is o. So from (4,2), move right to (4,3). Then maybe continue right. Let me backtrack.\n\nLet me retrace. So from (4,2), instead of going down to (5,2), go right to (4,3). Then from there, maybe proceed.\n\nSo path would be: down, down, right, right, down, right. Now at (4,3).\n\nFrom (4,3), possible directions. Let's see. Row 4 is o * o o o o o. So columns 3 is o. Let's check surrounding cells. Can move up (back to (3,3)? Let's check row 3, column 3. Row 3 is **o***o. So columns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *. So (3,3) is *, can't go up. So from (4,3), can move left back to (4,2), or right to (4,4), or down to (5,3). Let's check (5,3): row 5 is o * o * ** o. Column 3 is *, so can't move down. So from (4,3), can move right to (4,4). \n\nSo moving right to (4,4). Now at (4,4). From here, can move right to (4,5), which is o. Then to (4,6)? Let me check row 4: columns 5 is o? Row 4 is o * o o o o o. Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o. Yes. So (4,5) is o, (4,6) is o. \n\nSo moving right from (4,3) to (4,4), then to (4,5), then to (4,6). Now at (4,6). From there, can we move up, down, left, or right? Let's see. \n\nFrom (4,6), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,6). Row 3, column 6 is o. Let's check row 3: the last column (6) is o. So yes. So move up to (3,6). \n\nNow at (3,6). From there, can we move up to (2,6)? Row 2, column 6 is o. Yes. So move up. Now at (2,6). From there, up to (1,6). Row 1, column 6 is o. Yes. Now at (1,6). From here, can we move up to (0,6)? Row 0, column 6 is o. Yes. Now at (0,6). But that's the top right. From there, how to get to (6,6)? Well, (0,6) is column 6, row 0. To get down to row 6, column 6 (the X), need to move down through rows. Let's check if that path is possible. \n\nFrom (0,6), moving down through rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Let's check each cell:\n\nRow 1, column 6: o (already been there).\n\nRow 2, column 6: o (been there).\n\nRow 3, column 6: o (been there).\n\nRow 4, column 6: o (yes).\n\nRow 5, column 6: o? Row 5 is o * o * ** o. So column 6 is o. Yes.\n\nRow 6, column 6: X. \n\nSo from (0,6), moving down 6 steps would get to X. But let's see if that's possible. However, in our current path, we are at (0,6). So from there, moving down 6 times. But that would be a long way. However, perhaps there's a shorter way. But let's see if this path is viable.\n\nBut let's track the moves we made so far. Let me recap the path:\n\nStart → down (to 1,0) → down (to 2,0) → right (to 2,1) → right (to 2,2) → down (to 3,2) → down (to 4,2) → right (to 4,3) → right (to 4,4) → right (to 4,5) → right (to 4,6) → up (to 3,6) → up (to 2,6) → up (to 1,6) → up (to 0,6). Then down to X. \n\nBut this seems long. However, perhaps there's a shorter way. But let's check if that path works. \n\nBut maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check if each step is valid. \n\nBut first, let me think if there's a better path. Let me try another approach. Maybe from (4,6), instead of going up all the way, can I go down? From (4,6), down to (5,6). Row 5, column 6 is o. Then down to (6,6), which is X. That would be two moves. Oh right! So from (4,6), moving down to (5,6) then down to (6,6). That's much shorter. \n\nSo let me adjust. So when I was at (4,6), instead of moving up, move down twice. That would reach X. \n\nSo let's adjust the path. Let me retrace:\n\n... up to (4,6). Then move down to (5,6), then down to (6,6). \n\nSo how did I get to (4,6)? Let me retrace the steps again. \n\nOriginal path steps:\n\nStart (0,0) → down → (1,0) → down → (2,0) → right → (2,1) → right → (2,2) → down → (3,2) → down → (4,2) → right → (4,3) → right → (4,4) → right → (4,5) → right → (4,6). \n\nNow, from (4,6), move down to (5,6) → down to (6,6). That's two moves. So that's valid. \n\nSo the total path would be:\n\nMoves: down, down, right, right, down, down, right, right, right, right, down, down. \n\nBut let's check if each movement is valid. \n\nLet me map the coordinates step by step:\n\nStart at (0,0)\n\n1. down → (1,0)\n2. down → (2,0)\n3. right → (2,1)\n4. right → (2,2)\n5. down → (3,2)\n6. down → (4,2)\n7. right → (4,3)\n8. right → (4,4)\n9. right → (4,5)\n10. right → (4,6)\n11. down → (5,6)\n12. down → (6,6)\n\nYes. Let me check each step's validity:\n\nFrom (4,6), moving down to (5,6): row 5, column 6 is o (as per row 5's last column is o). Then down to (6,6) which is X. Valid. \n\nSo the moves required would be:\n\nEach move between steps:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): down.\n\nThen down again to (2,0).\n\nThen two rights to (2,2).\n\nThen down to (3,2), then down to (4,2).\n\nThen right three times? Wait, from (4,2) to (4,3) is one right, then to (4,4) another, then to (4,5) third, then to (4,6) fourth. So steps 7-10 are four right moves. So total moves:\n\ndown, down, right, right, down, down, right, right, right, right, down, down. \n\nSo the list would be: ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down'].\n\nBut let me check if there are any walls in between. \n\nFor example, when moving from (4,2) to (4,3): row 4, columns 2 is o, 3 is o. Yes. Then (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) are all o. Correct. \n\nSo this path seems valid. \n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path. Maybe there's another way. Let me think again. \n\nAlternative approach: Starting from (0,0), move right to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4). Then down to (1,4) but that's a wall. No. So maybe from (0,4) move down to row 2, column 4? Let me check. \n\nAt (0,4), down is row 1, column 4 which is * (as per row 1: columns 0 is o, then five * and then o. So column 4 is *). Can't go there. So that path is blocked. \n\nAnother alternative: from (0,0) go right to (0,1), down to (1,1) which is *, can't. So that's blocked. \n\nAnother idea: from (0,0) go right to (0,1), then down to row 2, column 1? Let's see. (0,1) down to (1,1) is *, blocked. So no. \n\nSo maybe the initial path is the correct one. \n\nAnother possible path: Let's think from (2,2) going up? No, because came from (2,0). Or maybe from (2,2) go left? No. \n\nAlternatively, from (3,2) go right? No, because (3,3) is *.\n\nSo the path we found seems valid. \n\nBut let me check if there's another way. For example, from (4,2), maybe go left? No, that's back to (4,1) which is *? No. Row 4, column 1 is * (row 4 is o * o o o o o). So column 1 is *, so no. \n\nSo yes, the path seems correct. \n\nNow, converting the moves into the list. The moves are:\n\ndown, down, right, right, down, down, right, right, right, right, down, down. \n\nWait, let's count again. The steps:\n\n1. down\n2. down\n3. right\n4. right\n5. down\n6. down\n7. right\n8. right\n9. right\n10. right\n11. down\n12. down\n\nYes. So the list would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path. For example, maybe a path that goes through row 2, column 3? But row 2 has a * at column 3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (2,2) go down to (3,2), then right? No, (3,3) is *. \n\nAnother possible path: Let me think again. \n\nStarting from (0,0), go right to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4). Then down to (1,4) is blocked. But what about down to (2,4)? Let's see. From (0,4), moving down two steps: row 1,4 is *, so can't. \n\nAnother idea: Let me check if there's a path that goes through row 4, column 0. \n\nBut perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe from (2,0) go down to (3,0) but that's a wall. \n\nSo the initial path seems the only way. \n\nAnother thing to check: when moving from (4,6) down to (5,6) and then to (6,6), that's correct. \n\nSo the answer would be that list. \n\nBut let me check the exact steps again. Let me write the coordinates again:\n\nStart at (0,0)\n\nMove down → (1,0)\n\nMove down → (2,0)\n\nMove right → (2,1)\n\nMove right → (2,2)\n\nMove down → (3,2)\n\nMove down → (4,2)\n\nMove right → (4,3)\n\nMove right → (4,4)\n\nMove right → (4,5)\n\nMove right → (4,6)\n\nMove down → (5,6)\n\nMove down → (6,6)\n\nYes, 12 moves. So the list is as above. \n\nNow, converting that into the required format: Answer: ['down','down','right','right','down','down','right','right','right','right','down','down']\n\nBut let me check if there are any typos. For example, in the movement from (4,2) to (4,3) etc. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAnother thing to check: the maze's row 5, column 6 is o. Yes, as per row 5: o * o * * * o. Column 6 is o. \n\nSo the path is valid. \n\nI think this is the correct path.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','right','right','down','down','right','right','right','right','down','down']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this maze. The maze is 12x12, right? Let me first try to visualize the maze based on the given input.\n\nThe first line is \"Ioooooooooooo\". So the starting point is at position (0,0). Then there are a bunch of 'o's. The destination 'X' is at the bottom right, probably in the last row. Let me check the last line: \"**o*********o\\nooooooooooo*X\". Wait, maybe the last line is the 12th row? Let me count the rows. The input has 12 lines, each representing a row. Let me index them from 0 to 11. The 'X' is in the last line (row 11?), and the line ends with 'X' maybe at column 11?\n\nFirst, I need to parse the maze correctly. Let me try to map out where the 'I' and 'X' are located. The start is at (0,0). The destination is at (row, column) where in the last line (probably row 11) there's an 'X'. Let me check the last line: the input for the last line is \"ooooooooooo*X\". Let's count the columns. Each row has 12 characters? Let's check the first line: \"Ioooooooooooo\" has 1 (I) + 12 o's? Wait, no. Let me count. The first line is \"I\" followed by 12 o's? Wait, \"Ioooooooooooo\" is I followed by 12 o? Let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\n\"I\" plus 12 o's would be 13 characters. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input lines:\n\nLine 1: Ioooooooooooo (I followed by 12 o? Let me count: I plus 12 o's would be 1+12=13 characters. Let me check the length of each line. The user provided 12 lines, each presumably of 13 characters (since 12x12 would need 12 characters per line, but maybe there's a typo? Wait, perhaps each line is 12 characters. Let me check the first line again: \"Ioooooooooooo\". Let me count the o's. Let me think:\n\n\"I\" followed by 12 o's would be 13 characters. But maybe the actual maze is 12x12, so each line has 12 characters. Let me check the first line again. Let me count the letters. For example, \"Ioooooooooooo\" – how many letters? Let's see:\n\nI followed by 12 o's would be 13. But perhaps the user made a typo. For example, maybe the first line is I followed by 11 o's, making it 12 characters. Let me check the line lengths. Since the user provided the maze as:\n\nIoooooooooooo\no*********o**\nooooooooo*ooo\no*o**********\no*ooooooooooo\no*o*o*o******\no*o*o*ooooooo\no***o*o***o**\nooo*o*ooo*ooo\no************\nooooooooooooo\n**o*********o\nooooooooooo*X\n\nAssuming each line is 12 or 13 characters. Let's take the first line, \"Ioooooooooooo\". Let me count the characters. Let's see:\n\nI followed by 12 o's would be 13 characters. Let me count:\n\nI o o o o o o o o o o o o → that's 1 + 12 = 13. So each line is 13 characters? But for a 12x12 maze, each row should have 12 cells. Maybe there's a typo in the input. Alternatively, perhaps the lines are of varying lengths. This could be a problem. Alternatively, maybe each line is 12 characters. Let me check the second line: \"o*********o**\". Let's count the characters here. Let's see:\n\no * * * * * * * * * o * * → that's 12 o? Or maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count:\n\nThe second line is \"o*********o**\". Let's split it:\n\nFirst character: o, then 9 * (maybe?), then o and **. Hmm, perhaps the actual length is 13. But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that each row is 12 characters. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the input's formatting, but since the user provided it as such, I need to parse it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended each line to be 12 characters. Let me check the last line: \"ooooooooooo*X\". Let's count the characters. o 11 times, then * and X? Or maybe ooooooooooo (11 o's) then * and X? That would be 13 characters. So perhaps each line is 13 characters. So the maze is 12 rows by 13 columns? But that's not square. Wait, the problem says it's an n*n maze. So n must be 12? Let me check if all lines have 12 characters. Let me take the first line again: \"Ioooooooooooo\". Let me count the letters. Let me write down:\n\nI followed by 12 o's would be 13. But maybe the line is \"I\" followed by 11 o's? Let me check the line length. Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the input. For example, maybe the first line is \"I\" followed by 12 o's, making it 13 characters, implying that the maze is 13x13? But the problem says it's n*n. However, the user provided 12 lines. So if there are 12 lines, each line is 12 characters, then it's 12x12. Let me check the first line again. Let me count the characters in the first line as given by the user:\n\n\"Ioooooooooooo\" – let's count:\n\nI o o o o o o o o o o o o → 13 characters. So that's 13. Then the second line is \"o*********o**\" – let's count:\n\no * * * * * * * * * o * * → that's 13 characters. So perhaps the maze is 12 rows by 13 columns. But that's not square. The problem says it's n*n. So maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo when writing the maze. But since I have to work with the given input, I need to figure out the correct positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each line is 12 characters. Let me check the first line again. Maybe I miscounted. Let me try again. Let me write \"Ioooooooooooo\" as:\n\nI o o o o o o o o o o o o → 13? Or perhaps the line is written as I followed by 12 o's. For example, if the line is \"I\" followed by 12 o's, then it's 13 characters. But the problem states that it's an n x n maze. If there are 12 rows, then each row must have 12 characters. So perhaps there's a typo in the input. Let me check the first line again. Maybe the user intended it to be 12 characters. Let me think: perhaps the first line is \"I\" followed by 11 o's, making it 12 characters. So maybe the line is \"Ioooooooooooo\" but that's 13 letters. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake when writing the input. This is a problem. Without knowing the exact dimensions, it's hard to proceed. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that each row is 12 characters. Let me check for the last line: \"ooooooooooo*X\". Let's count the characters here. If it's 12 characters, then:\n\no o o o o o o o o o o * X → but that's 12 o's? No, maybe 11 o's, then a *, then X. But that would be 13. Hmm. Maybe the last line is \"ooooooooooo*X\" with 12 characters. Let me count:\n\nAssuming the line is \"ooooooooooo*X\", the letters are:\n\n11 o's, then a *, then X. That's 13. But perhaps the user intended it to be 12. Maybe there's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the actual maze is 12x12, and each line has 12 characters. Let me try to parse each line as 12 characters. For example, the first line: \"Ioooooooooooo\" – perhaps it's a typo, and it should be \"I\" followed by 11 o's. Let me proceed with that assumption. So each line has 12 characters.\n\nSo for the first line, the start is at (0,0). The destination is in the last line (row 11?), column 11? Let me try to find where the 'X' is. Let's look at the last line: \"**o*********o\" or \"ooooooooooo*X\"? The last line as given is \"ooooooooooo*X\". Assuming that's row 11. Let me check the 12th line (assuming 0-based indexing). So, in that line, where is the X? Let's say the line is \"ooooooooooo*X\". If it's 12 characters, then the last character is X. But how? Let me think: maybe the line is \"oooooooooooX\", with 12 o's? No, because there's an X. So perhaps the line is \"oooooooooooX\", meaning 11 o's followed by X. So the X is at column 11 (assuming 0-based). So the destination is at (11, 11).\n\nNow, the task is to find a path from (0,0) to (11,11), moving up, down, left, right, through 'o's, avoiding '*'.\n\nTo solve this, I can model the maze as a grid and perform a BFS (breadth-first search) to find the shortest path. Since the problem requires the path as a list of moves, I need to track the path taken.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, let me try to sketch the maze and find a path.\n\nFirst, let me try to map out the maze. Let me index rows from 0 to 11 and columns from 0 to 11.\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o o o o o o (assuming 12 characters, so first character is 'I' at (0,0), then 11 o's. But according to the input line given, the first line is \"Ioooooooooooo\", which may be 13 characters. But given the problem's n*n, let's proceed with 12x12. So perhaps the first line is I followed by 11 o's. Let me proceed with that.\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o o o o o o → (0,0) is start.\n\nRow 1: o * * * * * * * * * o * * → but if it's 12 characters, maybe the line is o followed by 9 *, then o and **? Not sure. Let me try to parse each line as 12 characters.\n\nLet me take each line as provided and assume they are 12 characters each. Let me list them:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o o o o o o → (0,0) is I, rest o's.\n\nRow 1: o * * * * * * * * * o * → perhaps? But the input line is \"o*********o**\", but if it's 12 characters, maybe the line is o followed by 9 * then o and *? Not sure. Let me try to count:\n\nOriginal line for row 1: \"o*********o**\" – perhaps the user intended it to be 12 characters. Let's split into 12:\n\nAssume the line is o followed by 9 * then o and **. But that would be 1 + 9 + 1 + 2 = 13. So maybe there's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the line is \"o*********o*\", which is 12 characters. Let me think:\n\nThe line is written as \"o*********o**\", but maybe it's a typo and should be \"o*********o*\". Let me proceed with that. For the sake of solving the problem, I'll need to make assumptions here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting, and each line is 12 characters. Let me try to parse each line as 12 characters. For example:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o o o o o o → 12 o's plus I? No, 1 I and 11 o's.\n\nRow 1: o * * * * * * * * * o * → but that's 12 characters. Let's say the line is o followed by 9 * then o and * → but that's 1+9+1+1= 12? No. Maybe it's o followed by 8 * then o and 2 *? That would be 1+8+1+2=12? No. Maybe the line is o followed by 9 * then o. That would be 1+9+1= 11. Not enough. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed with the actual input lines as given, and assume that each line is 13 characters, making it a 12x13 maze, but that's not square. However, the problem says it's n x n. This is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the input, but since I have to work with it, perhaps I should proceed with the given lines and assume that each line is 13 characters, and the maze is 12 rows by 13 columns. But that's not square. However, the problem says it's n x n. So maybe the actual maze is 12x12, and the lines provided have some typos. For example, maybe the first line is \"I\" followed by 11 o's, making it 12 characters. Let me proceed with that.\n\nAssuming each line is 12 characters, here's how the maze looks:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o o o o o o → Start at (0,0).\n\nRow 1: o * * * * * * * * * o * → perhaps the line is \"o*********o*\", but I'm not sure. Let me think of the second line as having a wall (stars) in the middle. For example, maybe from row 1, columns 1 to 9 are walls, with o at column 0 and 10, and maybe a wall at column 11. But this is getting too vague. Maybe I should proceed with an actual path-finding approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to find a path step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). From there, possible moves: right or down. Since the first row (row 0) is all o's except the start, maybe I can move right. But need to check if there are walls in the maze.\n\nLet me try to trace:\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's try to move right as much as possible until I hit a wall.\n\nBut looking at row 0, columns 0 to 11 are all o's? According to the first line, which is \"Ioooooooooooo\" (assuming it's 1 I and 12 o's, making 13 characters, but for a 12x12 maze, that's not possible). So perhaps the first line is I followed by 11 o's. Let me proceed with that.\n\nSo, from (0,0), I can move right to (0,1), then (0,2), etc., up to (0,11). But looking at the next row, row 1. Let's say row 1 starts with o, then a lot of * (walls), then o and *? For example, in row 1, maybe columns 0 is o, then columns 1-9 are *, column 10 is o, column 11 is *.\n\nIf that's the case, then from (0,11), moving down to (1,11) would hit a wall. So maybe I need to go down earlier.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible path.\n\nStart at (0,0). Move right to (0,1), then maybe down to row 1, column 1. But if row 1, column 1 is a wall, then can't go there. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,0), move down as much as possible. Let's see what row 1, column 0 is. According to the second line, which is \"o*********o**\", assuming that the first character is o. So row 1, column 0 is o. So I can move down from (0,0) to (1,0).\n\nSo step 1: move down.\n\nNow at (1,0). From here, can I move down again? Let's check row 2, column 0. The third line is \"ooooooooo*ooo\". Assuming first character is o. So yes, row 2, column 0 is o. Move down again.\n\nContinue this until I hit a wall. Let's see:\n\nRow 0: (0,0)\nRow 1: (1,0)\nRow 2: (2,0)\nRow 3: o*o...? The fourth line is \"o*o**********\". Assuming first character is o. So row 3, column 0 is o. Move down again.\n\nRow 4: line is \"o*ooooooooooo\". First character is o. Move down.\n\nRow 5: line is \"o*o*o*o******\". First character is o. Move down.\n\nRow 6: line is \"o*o*o*ooooooo\". First character is o. Move down.\n\nRow 7: line is \"o***o*o***o**\". First character is o. Move down.\n\nRow 8: line is \"ooo*o*ooo*ooo\". First character is o. Move down.\n\nRow 9: line is \"o************\". First character is o. Move down.\n\nRow 10: line is \"ooooooooooooo\". First character is o. Move down.\n\nRow 11: line is \"**o*********o\". First character is *, so cannot move down from (10,0). So at row 10, column 0, I can't go down to (11,0) because it's a wall. So need to find another way.\n\nSo from (10,0), I need to move right or up. Since I came from up, maybe move right.\n\nAt row 10, column 0 is o. Let's move right. Let me check row 10's line: \"ooooooooooooo\". Assuming it's all o's. So I can move right all the way to column 11. Let's go to (10, 11). From there, move down to row 11, column 11 if possible. But row 11's line is \"**o*********o\". Let me check the last column. Assuming the line is \"**o*********oX\" or something. But earlier I assumed the X is at (11,11). Let me check the last line again. The user provided the last line as \"ooooooooooo*X\". Assuming that in row 11, column 11 is X. So if I can get to (11,11), that's the end.\n\nBut row 11's first two characters are **, so (11,0) and (11,1) are walls. Let's see, if I'm at (10, 2), can I move down? Let's think. For example, if row 11, column 2 is o, then yes. But according to the last line: \"**o*********o\", assuming it's 12 characters, the third character is o, followed by stars, then ending with o. So if I'm at (10,2), moving down to (11,2) which is o. Then proceed right from there to reach X.\n\nBut how to get from (10,0) to (10,2)? Since row 10 is all o's, I can move right from (10,0) to (10,2). Then down to (11,2). Then proceed right through the row 11 until reaching X.\n\nBut where is X located? Let me think. The last line is \"**o*********o\". Let's say it's 12 characters. So positions 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, etc., up to position 11: o. But the user's input for the last line is \"ooooooooooo*X\". So perhaps there's a typo, and the last line should be \"ooooooooooooX\" (12 o's and an X?), but this is unclear. Given the ambiguity, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the X is at (11, 11), and that in row 11, column 11 is X. So from (11,2), I can move right through columns 2 to 11, but need to check if there are walls in between.\n\nBut row 11's line is \"**o*********o\". Assuming that after column 2, it's all * except for the last column. For example, if the line is \"**o*********o\", then positions 2 is o, then from 3 to 10 are *, and position 11 is o. But if that's the case, then from (11,2), moving right to (11,11) would hit walls at columns 3-10. So that path is blocked. So perhaps there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path through other rows. Let me think again.\n\nLet me try to outline the path again. Starting from (0,0), moving down as far as possible to (10,0). Then move right to (10, something), then down, then right again.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better path. Let me think of another approach.\n\nStarting at (0,0), move right to (0,1), then down to (1,1). But row 1, column 1 is *? Let me check. The second line is \"o*********o**\". Assuming it's o followed by 9 * then o and **. So if column 1 is *, then yes. So from (0,1), down to (1,1) is a wall. Can't go there. So maybe move down from (0,0) to (1,0) as before.\n\nAnother idea: from (0,0), move right to (0, something), then down when possible. For example, if there's a way to go down at certain points.\n\nBut let's think about the maze structure. For example, row 0 is all o's, so I can move right as far as possible. Let's say I go all the way to (0, 11), then try to move down. But row 1, column 11 is * (assuming the second line ends with **). So from (0,11), can't move down. So need to backtrack.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to go down as much as possible from the start, then right when needed.\n\nSo back to being at (10,0). From there, move right to (10, 0)... let's say I move right to (10, 2), then down to (11, 2). Then from there, can I move right? Let's assume that in row 11, columns 2 to 11 are passable? Not sure. Given the last line is \"**o*********o\", perhaps it's **o followed by several * and ending with o. So if I'm at (11,2), moving right would hit * at column 3. So stuck. So need another way.\n\nMaybe I need to find a different path earlier. Let me think about other possibilities.\n\nLet me consider moving from (0,0) down to (1,0), then right when possible. For example, at row 1, column 0 is o. Can I move right here? Row 1's line is \"o*********o**\", so column 0 is o, column 1 is *, so can't move right. So stuck. So must move down again.\n\nSo from (1,0), move down to (2,0). Row 2 is \"ooooooooo*ooo\". So column 0 is o. Move down again.\n\nRow 3: \"o*o**********\". Column 0 is o. Move down to (4,0).\n\nRow 4: \"o*ooooooooooo\". Column 0 is o. Move down to (5,0).\n\nRow 5: \"o*o*o*o******\". Column 0 is o. Move down to (6,0).\n\nRow 6: \"o*o*o*ooooooo\". Column 0 is o. Move down to (7,0).\n\nRow 7: \"o***o*o***o**\". Column 0 is o. Move down to (8,0).\n\nRow 8: \"ooo*o*ooo*ooo\". Column 0 is o. Move down to (9,0).\n\nRow 9: \"o************\". Column 0 is o. Move down to (10,0).\n\nNow at (10,0). As before. From here, move right. Let's try to move right as much as possible before hitting a wall. Since row 10 is \"ooooooooooooo\" (all o's?), I can move all the way to (10, 11). From there, try to move down to (11, 11). But what is at (11, 11)? The last line's last character is X. Assuming that in row 11, column 11 is X, and it's passable. But what about the path from (10,11) to (11,11)? Let me check row 11's column 11. The last line is \"**o*********o\" or \"ooooooooooo*X\". Assuming it's the latter, then column 11 is X. But what about the path from (10,11) down? Let's see: row 11, column 11 is X. So if (11, 11) is X, then from (10,11), moving down is allowed if row 11, column 11 is o or X. Assuming it is, then this path works. But what about the rest of the row?\n\nIf row 11's line is \"**o*********X\", then columns 0 and 1 are *, column 2 is o, then columns 3-10 are *, and column 11 is X. So from (10,11), moving down to (11,11) is possible. So this would be a valid path.\n\nSo the path would be:\n\nStart at (0,0), move down 10 times to (10,0), then move right 11 times to (10,11), then move down once to (11,11).\n\nBut let's check if row 10 allows moving right all the way. Row 10's line is \"ooooooooooooo\". Assuming it's 12 o's, then yes. So moving right from (10,0) to (10,11) would take 11 moves right. Then down to (11,11). So the moves would be:\n\nDown 10 times, then right 11 times, then down once.\n\nBut converting this to the list of moves:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): down.\n\nRepeat until (10,0): total 10 downs.\n\nThen right 11 times to (10,11).\n\nThen down once to (11,11).\n\nSo the move list would be ['down'] * 10 + ['right'] * 11 + ['down'].\n\nBut wait, let me count the number of down moves from (0,0) to (10,0). Starting at row 0, moving down to row 1, then row 2, ..., row 10: that's 10 moves down (since from row 0 to row 10 is 10 steps).\n\nYes. Then from (10,0) to (10,11): 11 moves right. Then one move down. Total moves: 10+11+1=22.\n\nBut I need to verify if this path is valid. Let me check for any walls in row 10. If row 10 is all o's, then yes. According to the input, the 10th line is \"ooooooooooooo\". Assuming that's 12 o's, then yes.\n\nAnd the last move from (10,11) to (11,11) is allowed if row 11, column 11 is X (which it is). But what about the path in row 11? Let's say from (11,11), it's the destination. So this path works.\n\nBut wait, the last line provided by the user is:\n\n**o*********o\nooooooooooo*X\n\nWait, the user provided 12 lines. Let me check the last two lines again:\n\nThe 11th line (assuming 0-based) might be:\n\nLine 10: ooooooooooooo\nLine 11: **o*********o\nWait, no, the user's input for the last line is \"ooooooooooo*X\". Let me recheck:\n\nThe user's input for the maze is:\n\nLine 1: Ioooooooooooo\nLine 2: o*********o**\nLine 3: ooooooooo*ooo\nLine 4: o*o**********\nLine 5: o*ooooooooooo\nLine 6: o*o*o*o******\nLine 7: o*o*o*ooooooo\nLine 8: o***o*o***o**\nLine 9: ooo*o*ooo*ooo\nLine 10: o************\nLine 11: ooooooooooooo\nLine 12: **o*********o\nLine 13: ooooooooooooX\n\nWait, no, the user provided 12 lines. Let me recount:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nMaze Board:\nIoooooooooooo\no*********o**\nooooooooo*ooo\no*o**********\no*ooooooooooo\no*o*o*o******\no*o*o*ooooooo\no***o*o***o**\nooo*o*ooo*ooo\no************\nooooooooooooo\n**o*********o\nooooooooooo*X\n\nWait, that's 13 lines? Let me count:\n\n1. Ioooooooooooo\n2. o*********o**\n3. ooooooooo*ooo\n4. o*o**********\n5. o*ooooooooooo\n6. o*o*o*o******\n7. o*o*o*ooooooo\n8. o***o*o***o**\n9. ooo*o*ooo*ooo\n10. o************\n11. ooooooooooooo\n12. **o*********o\n13. ooooooooooooX\n\nYes, 13 lines. But the problem says it's an n x n maze. This suggests that there's a mistake in the input. Perhaps the last line is part of the 12th row? Or there's a typo. This is confusing. Given this, perhaps the actual maze is 13 rows by 13 columns. But the problem says n x n. Assuming that it's 13x13, then the start is at (0,0), and the X is at (12,12).\n\nBut this complicates things. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that the maze is 13 rows by 13 columns, with the start at (0,0) and X at (12,12).\n\nLet me re-express the maze as 13 rows:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o o o o o o o\nRow 1: o * * * * * * * * * o * *\nRow 2: o o o o o o o o o * o o o\nRow 3: o * o * * * * * * * * * *\nRow 4: o * o o o o o o o o o o o\nRow 5: o * o * o * o * * * * * *\nRow 6: o * o * o * o o o o o o o\nRow 7: o * * * o * o * * * o * *\nRow 8: o o o * o * o o o * o o o\nRow 9: o * * * o * o o o * o o o\nRow 10: o * * * * * * * * * * * *\nRow 11: o o o o o o o o o o o o o\nRow 12: * * o * * * * * * * * o\nRow 13: o o o o o o o o o o o o X\n\nWait, no, the last line provided is \"ooooooooooo*X\", which for row 12 (assuming 0-based), it would be \"ooooooooooo*X\", which is 13 characters. Assuming the X is at (12, 12).\n\nWith this structure, let's try to find a path.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's try to move down as much as possible.\n\nRow 0: (0,0) is I. Can move down to row 1, column 0. Row 1, column 0 is o. Then down to row 2, column 0 (o). Row 3, column 0 is o. Down to row 4, column 0 (o). Row 5, column 0 is o. Down to row 6, column 0 (o). Row 7, column 0 is o. Down to row 8, column 0 (o). Row 9, column 0 is o. Down to row 10, column 0: row 10 starts with o? Let's check row 10: \"o************\" → yes, column 0 is o. Down to row 11, column 0: row 11 is \"ooooooooooooo\", so o. Down to row 12, column 0: row 12 is \"**o*********o\", so column 0 is *, which is a wall. So can't move down from row 11, column 0. So at row 11, column 0, need to move right.\n\nSo from (11,0), move right. Row 11 is all o's, so can move to (11, 12). From there, move down to row 12, column 12 if possible. But row 12, column 12 is X. Let's see: row 12 is \"**o*********o\". Wait, let me parse row 12's line: \"**o*********o\". Assuming it's 13 characters. Let's index columns 0-12.\n\nRow 12: [*, *, o, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, o, ?]. Wait, the line is \"**o*********o\". Let's count the * and o:\n\nFirst two are *, then o, then nine *? Let me see:\n\n\"**o*********o\" → positions 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, then 9 * (positions 3-11), then position 12: o. So row 12, column 12 is o, not X. But the user's last line is \"ooooooooooo*X\". Wait, the 13th line? Or is the last line row 12? Let me check again.\n\nThe user's input for the maze is 13 lines, with the last line being \"ooooooooooo*X\". Assuming that this is row 12, and it's 13 characters, then column 12 is X. Let me parse that line: \"ooooooooooo*X\" → 12 o's and then X. So column 12 is X. So row 12 is \"ooooooooooo*X\", which would be columns 0-12: o's from 0-11, and X at 12.\n\nBut earlier, row 12 was described as \"**o*********o\" in the 12th line. Wait, no, the user's input has 13 lines. Let me recheck:\n\nThe user's input for the maze is:\n\nLine 1: Ioooooooooooo\nLine 2: o*********o**\nLine 3: ooooooooo*ooo\nLine 4: o*o**********\nLine 5: o*ooooooooooo\nLine 6: o*o*o*o******\nLine 7: o*o*o*ooooooo\nLine 8: o***o*o***o**\nLine 9: ooo*o*ooo*ooo\nLine 10: o************\nLine 11: ooooooooooooo\nLine 12: **o*********o\nLine 13: ooooooooooooX\n\nSo line 13 is the last line, which is \"oooooooooooX\" (assuming it's 13 characters: 12 o's and X). So row 12 (assuming 0-based) is line 12: \"**o*********o\", and row 13 is line 13: \"oooooooooooX\". But the problem states it's an n x n maze. If there are 13 lines, it's 13 rows. But the last line (row 12) has X at column 12. So the maze is 13x13.\n\nNow, the destination is at (12,12).\n\nSo, back to the path. At row 11, column 0, I can move right all the way to (11,12). From there, move down to (12,12), which is X. But what is at (12,12)? In row 12, column 12 is X. But row 12 is line 12: \"**o*********o\". Let me check column 12 of row 12. The line is \"**o*********o\" (assuming 13 characters). Let's count:\n\nPositions 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: *, 11: o, 12: o? Or is it \"**o*********o\" which is 13 characters. Let's see:\n\nThe string \"**o*********o\" has 13 characters. Let's break it down:\n\n- 0: *\n- 1: *\n- 2: o\n- 3: *\n- 4: *\n- 5: *\n- 6: *\n- 7: *\n- 8: *\n- 9: *\n- 10: *\n- 11: o\n- 12: o ?\n\nWait, no. Let me count the number of * between the o's. The string is **o followed by nine * and ending with o? Or **o followed by 9 * and then o? Let me see:\n\nThe string is \"**o*********o\". After the initial **o, there are 9 * and then o? Let's count:\n\n**o (3 characters) + 9 * (9) + o (1) = 13. Yes. So positions 0-2: **o, positions 3-11: *********, and position 12: o. So row 12, column 12 is o, not X. But the last line (row 13) is \"oooooooooooX\", which is 13 characters. So row 13, column 12 is X. But this would mean the maze has 13 rows and 13 columns, and the destination is at (13-1, 13-1) = (12,12), but in row 13, column 12 is X. Wait, if the last line is row 12 (assuming 0-based), then it's \"oooooooooooX\" and X is at (12,12). But the previous line (row 12) is \"**o*********o\" which has o at (12,12). This is conflicting. It seems there's a mistake in the user's input. Perhaps the last line should be part of row 12, and the X is at (12,12). Given the confusion, I'll proceed with the assumption that the X is at (12,12) in a 13x13 maze, and that in row 12, column 12 is X, and the line provided for row 12 is incorrect, or perhaps the last line is row 12.\n\nAssuming that, the path from (11,12) down to (12,12) is possible. But in row 12, column 12 is X, which is passable. So the path would be:\n\nFrom (0,0) down to (11,0), then right to (11,12), then down to (12,12).\n\nLet me verify the steps:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): down.\n\nRepeat down to (11,0): that's 11 down moves.\n\nThen right from (11,0) to (11,12): 12 moves right.\n\nThen down to (12,12): 1 move down.\n\nTotal moves: 11 + 12 + 1 = 24.\n\nBut need to check if all these steps are valid.\n\nFirst, from (0,0) down to (11,0): each row from 0 to 11, column 0 is o? Let's check each row:\n\nRow 0: o (start)\nRow 1: o (column 0 is o)\nRow 2: o (row 2 starts with o)\nRow 3: o (row 3, column 0 is o)\nRow 4: o\nRow 5: o\nRow 6: o\nRow 7: o\nRow 8: o (row 8 starts with ooo*... so column 0 is o)\nRow 9: o (row 9 starts with o)\nRow 10: o (row 10 starts with o)\nRow 11: o (row 11 starts with o)\nYes, all these are o, so moving down is possible.\n\nFrom (11,0) to (11,12): row 11 is all o's (assuming the line is \"ooooooooooooo\" for row 11, which is 13 o's). So moving right 12 times to column 12 is possible.\n\nFrom (11,12) down to (12,12): row 12, column 12 is X, which is passable. So this is valid.\n\nThus, this path is valid. The move list would be:\n\n['down'] * 11 + ['right'] * 12 + ['down'].\n\nBut the problem requires the output to be a list of moves like ['up', 'down', ...]. Let me count the number of down moves:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): down (1 move), then to (2,0): down (2nd move)... up to (11,0): 11 moves down.\n\nThen 12 moves right.\n\nThen 1 move down.\n\nSo the list is:\n\n['down', 'down', ..., 'down'] (11 times), ['right', ..., 'right'] (12 times), ['down'].\n\nSo the answer would be:\n\nAnswer: ['down'] * 11 + ['right'] * 12 + ['down'].\n\nBut let me check if there are any obstacles in this path. For example, when moving down from row 0 to row 11, column 0, are there any walls? For example, in row 9, column 0 is o (row 9 is \"o************\", so column 0 is o). Yes. Row 10 is \"ooooooooooooo\", column 0 is o. Row 11 is \"ooooooooooooo\", column 0 is o. Yes.\n\nSo this path is valid.\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path. For example, perhaps there's a way to move right earlier and avoid some down moves. But given the structure of the maze, it seems that the early rows have many walls in the right columns, so moving down first might be the only way.\n\nThus, the final answer would be a list of moves as described.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','down']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this maze and find a path from the start 'I' to the destination 'X'. The maze is 5x5. Let me first visualize the maze based on the given input.\n\nThe maze is given as:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o\nRow 1: o * * * *\nRow 2: o o o o o\nRow 3: o * * * o\nRow 4: o o o * X\n\nWait, let me check again. The input is:\n\nIoooo\no****\nooooo\no***o\nooo*X\n\nBreaking it down row by row:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o\nRow 1: o * * * * \nRow 2: o o o o o\nRow 3: o * * * o\nRow 4: o o o * X\n\nSo coordinates can be considered as (row, column), starting from (0,0) perhaps.\n\nThe start is at position (0,0) since that's where 'I' is. The destination 'X' is at (4,4).\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (4,4), moving through 'o's and avoiding '*'.\n\nLet me think about possible paths. Let's try to map it out step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's look at possible moves. From (0,0), possible directions are down or right. Because up and left would be out of bounds.\n\nFirst, check down to (1,0). Row 1, column 0 is 'o' (since row 1 starts with o followed by stars). Wait row 1 is \"o****\", so row 1, column 0 is 'o', columns 1-4 are '*'. So from (0,0), moving down to (1,0) is allowed. Alternatively, moving right to (0,1) is possible since that's an 'o'.\n\nLet me try both possibilities. Maybe BFS is better, but since I'm doing this manually, let's think.\n\nFirst path: Start at (0,0). Let's try moving down to (1,0). From (1,0), possible moves. Can we move down again to (2,0)? Yes, because row 2, column 0 is 'o'. So moving down from (1,0) to (2,0). Then from (2,0), possible directions: up (back to 1,0?), but maybe better to move right. Let's see. From (2,0), moving right to (2,1), then (2,2), etc. Let's try that.\n\nSo path so far: down (from 0,0 to 1,0), down (to 2,0). Now at (2,0). Let's move right to (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Wait, row 2 is all o's. So that's possible. Once at (2,4), can we move up or down? Let's check. From (2,4), moving up to row 1, column 4: that's a '*' (since row 1 is o followed by four *). So can't move up. Moving down to row 3, column 4: row 3, column 4 is 'o' (since row 3 is o***o). So yes. So from (2,4) down to (3,4). Then from (3,4), can we move left? Let's check. But row 3 has walls in columns 1-3. So from (3,4), moving left to (3,3) is a '*'? Let me check row 3: o***o. So columns 0 is 'o', columns 1-3 are *, column 4 is 'o'. Wait original input for row 3 is \"o***o\", so (3,0) is o, (3,1) *, (3,2) *, (3,3) *, (3,4) o. So from (3,4), can move left to (3,3)? No, because that's a *? Wait no, (3,4) is o. To move left, the next cell is (3,3), which is *, so can't. So from (3,4), possible directions are up (back to 2,4?), or maybe left? No. Or maybe up to 2,4. Hmm. So from (3,4), how to proceed? Let's think. From here, maybe need to go up to (2,4), then go left? But (2,4) is in row 2, column 4. From there, moving left to (2,3), which is o. Then perhaps down to (3,3)? But that's a *? No. Wait row 3, column 3 is *, so can't. So maybe from (2,4) go left to (2,3). Then from (2,3), can we move down? Let's check. (2,3) is o. Moving down to (3,3) which is *? No. So stuck? Hmm. So maybe that path isn't working. Let me backtrack.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe when I was at (2,4), instead of going down to (3,4), perhaps I need to find another way. Let's see. From (2,4), perhaps moving left earlier. Let me think again. Let's try another path.\n\nStarting again. From (0,0), maybe moving right first. Let's try that. So starting at (0,0). Move right to (0,1). From there, can move right again to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4). But then from (0,4), moving down to row 1, column 4 is *, so that's blocked. So can't go that way. So perhaps that path is not helpful. So maybe moving down first is better.\n\nBack to the earlier path: Start at (0,0) down to (1,0). Then down to (2,0). Now moving right along row 2. Let's say we go to (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4). Then down to (3,4). Now at (3,4). From here, can we move down? Row 4, column 4 is X. So yes. So from (3,4) move down to (4,4). Which is the destination. Oh! Wait! That's possible. Because row 3, column 4 is o, and row 4, column 4 is X. So moving down from (3,4) to (4,4). That's the destination. So that's a valid path. So the steps would be:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nMoves:\n\ndown (to 1,0)\n\ndown (to 2,0)\n\nright, right, right, right (from 2,0 to 2,4)\n\ndown (to 3,4)\n\ndown (to 4,4)\n\nSo the directions would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']\n\nBut let's check each step.\n\nLet me map the coordinates:\n\nStart (0,0).\n\nAfter down → (1,0).\n\nDown again → (2,0).\n\nThen right four times to reach (2,4). Then down to (3,4). Then down to (4,4). Yes. So that's a valid path. Let me check if any of those steps are blocked. For example, row 2 is all o's, so moving right is okay. From (2,4), down to (3,4) which is o. Then down again to (4,4) which is X. So yes. That's a valid path.\n\nSo the moves would be:\n\ndown, down, right, right, right, right, down, down.\n\nBut the problem says to output the list of moves. Let me check the steps again.\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\nFirst move down → (1,0): 'down'\n\nSecond move down → (2,0): 'down'\n\nThen from (2,0) moving right to (2,1): 'right'\n\nThen right again to (2,2): 'right'\n\nThen to (2,3): 'right'\n\nThen to (2,4): 'right' → that's four rights? Wait from (2,0) to (2,4) requires moving right four times (columns 0→1, 1→2, 2→3, 3→4). So four 'right's. So the moves would be four 'right's. Then down to (3,4): 'down', then down to (4,4): 'down'. So total moves: 2 downs, 4 rights, 2 downs. So the list is ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down'].\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path. Maybe another way?\n\nAlternative path: From (0,0) move right to (0,1). But then from there, can't go down because row 1, column 1 is *? Let's check. Row 1 is o****. So row 1, column 0 is o, columns 1-4 are *. So from (0,1), moving down would take us to (1,1), which is *, so blocked. So that's not helpful. So maybe that's not a good path.\n\nAnother possibility: From (0,0) move down to (1,0), then right? Wait, (1,0) is o. Can we move right to (1,1)? But that's a *? So no. So from (1,0), possible moves are down (to 2,0) or up (back to 0,0). So no other options. So the initial path seems valid.\n\nAnother possible path: Let's see. From (0,0) down to (1,0), then down to (2,0). From (2,0), maybe move down to (3,0). Let's check row 3, column 0 is o. So yes. So move down again. Then from (3,0), can we move right? Since row 3 is o***o. So column 0 is o, then *s from 1-3, then column 4 is o. So from (3,0), moving right to (3,1) is blocked. So no. So perhaps from (3,0), move up? Back to (2,0). Not helpful. Or move right? No. So maybe that's not helpful. So original path is better.\n\nAnother idea: From (2,0), move up to (1,0) is possible but not helpful. So original path seems best.\n\nSo the path I found is valid. Let me check again:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nDown → (1,0)\n\nDown → (2,0)\n\nRight four times to (2,4)\n\nDown → (3,4)\n\nDown → (4,4). Correct.\n\nYes. So the answer is the list of those moves.\n\nBut let me check another possible path. For example, maybe going from (0,0) right to (0,1) is blocked, but perhaps there's another way. Let me think again. Suppose from (0,0) move right to (0,1). Then move down to (1,1) but that's *? No. So that's blocked. Not helpful. So no.\n\nAnother possibility: From (0,0) move down to (1,0), then right is blocked. So down again to (2,0). Then right to (2,1). From (2,1), can we move down to (3,1)? No, because row 3, column 1 is *. So can't. So from (2,1), need to move right to (2,2), then right to (2,3), etc. So same as before. So yes, the original path is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']\n\nLet me count the steps. Let's see:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nAfter down (1,0) → 1\n\ndown (2,0) → 2\n\nright (2,1) → 3\n\nright (2,2) →4\n\nright (2,3) →5\n\nright (2,4) →6\n\ndown (3,4) →7\n\ndown (4,4) →8. So 8 moves total. Which matches the list length.\n\nYes. So that's correct. So the answer is that list.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','right','right','right','right','down','down']"

      "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this maze. First, I need to understand the maze structure. The user provided an 11x11 grid with 'I' as the start and 'X' as the end. The goal is to find a path from 'I' to 'X' moving only through 'o's and avoiding '*' walls. The output should be a list of directions: up, down, left, right.\n\nFirst, I need to map out the maze. Let me write down the grid row by row to visualize it better.\n\nRow 0: Ioooooooooo\nRow 1: o*o********\nRow 2: o*ooooooooo\nRow 3: **o*o*o***o\nRow 4: ooo*o*ooo*o\nRow 5: **o*o*o*o*o\nRow 6: ooo*o*o*o*o\nRow 7: **o*o***o*o\nRow 8: ooo*ooo*o*o\nRow 9: o***o***o*o\nRow 10: ooo*ooo*o*X\n\nSo the start 'I' is at position (0,0). The end 'X' is at (10,10). Let me note the coordinates. Each cell is (row, column), starting from (0,0) to (10,10).\n\nNow, I need to find a path. Since the maze is complex, I'll need to use some pathfinding algorithm. The most straightforward for this kind of problem is probably BFS (Breadth-First Search), which ensures the shortest path. However, since I'm doing this manually, I'll have to simulate BFS step by step.\n\nLet me start by noting the starting position. From (0,0), possible moves. Let's look at the adjacent cells. The first cell is (0,0). Let's check possible directions.\n\nFrom (0,0), possible moves:\n\n- Right: (0,1) is 'o' (since row 0 is I followed by o's)\n- Down: (1,0) is 'o' (row 1, column 0 is 'o')\n\nSo initial possibilities are moving right or down. Let me consider both directions but perhaps proceed step by step.\n\nLet me try to outline the path. Let me try to sketch the path mentally.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's try moving down first. Moving down to (1,0). Then from (1,0), can I go down again? Row 2, column 0 is 'o'? Let me check row 2: o*ooooooooo. So row 2, column 0 is 'o'. So from (1,0) down to (2,0). Then from (2,0), can I go right? Let's see. Row 2: o*o... So columns 0 is 'o', column 1 is '*', column 2 is 'o'. So from (2,0), moving right to (2,1) is blocked by a wall. So maybe move down or up? Wait, from (2,0), moving down to row 3, column 0. Row 3 starts with **, so (3,0) is '*', which is a wall. So can't go down. Moving up to (1,0), but that's where we came from. So maybe from (2,0) we can go right? No, column 1 is a wall. So perhaps from (2,0), the only direction is to go right to column 2? Wait, row 2's column 2 is 'o'? Let me check row 2 again: o*ooooooooo. Let me parse it properly. The first three characters of row 2: o * o. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o. So from (2,0), moving right to (2,1) is blocked. But moving right again to (2,2) is possible? Wait, no, from (2,0), moving right one step is (2,1) which is a wall. So perhaps from (2,0) we can only move down if possible. But row 3, column 0 is **... so (3,0) is *, so no. So maybe from (2,0) we need to go right to column 2? Wait, maybe I can move right two steps? No, because each move is one cell. So perhaps from (2,0), we can only go up (back) or try to move right but blocked. So maybe the path from (0,0) down to (1,0) and then to (2,0) is a dead end? Then perhaps the initial direction should be right instead of down?\n\nLet me backtrack. Starting at (0,0), moving right. Let's see. The first row is I followed by ten o's. So from (0,0) moving right to (0,1), then (0,2), etc. Let me think. Let me try to find a path going right first. Let's see.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's move right several times. But need to find a path that can eventually reach the X at (10,10). However, looking at the maze, perhaps going down is necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the path requires a combination of right and down moves. Let me try to outline possible steps.\n\nLet me try to think of the maze as a grid. Let me note the positions where walls are. For example, row 1 has o*o followed by stars. So row 1, columns 0 is o, column 1 is *, column 2 is o, then columns 3-9 are * (since the row is o*o********; after the third character, it's all * until the end? Let me count. The row is \"o*o********\" which is 11 characters. Let's check:\n\nRow 1: o * o * * * * * * * * ?\n\nWait, original input says the maze is 11x11. Each row has 11 characters. Let me check:\n\nRow 0: I followed by 10 o's → 11 characters. Correct.\n\nRow 1: o*o******** → o, *, o, then 8 *s? Let's count:\n\no (1), * (2), o (3), then 8 *s? 3 + 8 = 11. Yes. So columns 3-10 are *.\n\nSo row 1, columns 0 is o, column 1 is *, column 2 is o, columns 3-10 are *.\n\nSo, for example, from (0,0) moving right to (0,1), (0,2)... up to (0,10). But to get to the bottom, maybe need to go down.\n\nLet me try to plan a path.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let me try moving down first. So (0,0) → down to (1,0). Then from (1,0), can we go down to (2,0)? Yes, since row 2, column 0 is o. From (2,0), can we move right? Let's check row 2: \"o*ooooooooo\". So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, etc. So from (2,0), moving right to (2,1) is blocked. But moving down to (3,0)? Row 3 starts with \"**o*...\", so (3,0) is *, blocked. So from (2,0), can't move down or right. So only possible direction is up to (1,0), but that's where we came from. So dead end. Therefore, maybe moving down first isn't the way. Let's try moving right first.\n\nFrom (0,0), moving right to (0,1), then (0,2)... perhaps to (0,2) and then down?\n\nLet me think. Let's try:\n\n(0,0) → right to (0,1), then right to (0,2). Now at (0,2). From here, can we move down? Let's check row 1, column 2. Row 1 is o*o********. Column 2 is o. So (1,2) is o. So moving down from (0,2) to (1,2). Then from (1,2), can we move down again? Row 2, column 2 is o. Yes. So (2,2). Now at (2,2). From here, perhaps move right? Let's see row 2's columns. Row 2 is o*o followed by o's. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, etc. So from (2,2), moving right to (2,3) is possible. Let me proceed.\n\nSo path so far: right, right, down, down. Directions would be 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down'? Wait, initial steps:\n\nStart at (0,0). First move is right → direction 'right' to (0,1). Second move right again to (0,2). Then down to (1,2) → direction 'down'. Then down again to (2,2) → direction 'down'.\n\nNow at (2,2). Let's see. From here, possible directions: right, left, up, down. Let's check:\n\nRight: (2,3) is o. Down: row 3, column 2. Row 3 is **o*o*o***o. Let me parse row 3. The row is \"**o*o*o***o\". Let's break it down:\n\nColumns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: o?\n\nWait, the row is \"**o*o*o***o\". Let me count each character:\n\nAssuming it's 11 characters:\n\nIndices 0-10:\n\n0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: o?\n\nSo yes. So at (2,2), moving down to (3,2) is o. So possible. So from (2,2), moving down to (3,2). Then from there?\n\nSo adding direction 'down' to the path. Now at (3,2). Let's look around.\n\nFrom (3,2), possible moves:\n\nUp: (2,2) where we came from.\n\nLeft: (3,1) is * (from row 3's first two *s).\n\nRight: (3,3) is *.\n\nSo can't go left or right. Can we move down? Row 4, column 2. Let's check row 4: \"ooo*o*ooo*o\". Let me parse row 4: columns 0-3: o o o *, then o * o o o * o?\n\nWait, the row is \"ooo*o*ooo*o\". Let me split it:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o.\n\nSo row 4, column 2 is o. So from (3,2) moving down to (4,2). So direction 'down'. Now at (4,2). Let's check possible moves.\n\nFrom (4,2), possible directions:\n\nUp to (3,2) — came from there.\n\nLeft? (4,1): since row 4's column 1 is o? Wait, row 4 is \"ooo*o*ooo*o\". Let me check columns 0-3: o, o, o, * → column 3 is *, columns 0-2 are o. So column 1 is o. So (4,1) is o? Wait, no. Wait, if the first three are o's, then column 0: o, column 1: o, column 2: o. Then column 3 is *.\n\nSo (4,2) is column 2, which is o. So from (4,2), can move left to (4,1)? Let me check. But how do I get there? Let me think. From (4,2), moving left would be to (4,1). Is that allowed? Yes, since it's o. But how did I get to (4,2)? From (3,2) down. So maybe from (4,2), moving left to (4,1) is possible. But then what? Let me see. Let me try that path.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,2), moving right? Column 3 is * (from row 4's structure). So can't go right. Down? Row 5, column 2. Let me check row 5: \"**o*o*o*o*o\". Let me parse row 5: columns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o. So column 2 is o. So moving down from (4,2) to (5,2). So direction 'down'. Now at (5,2). Let's check.\n\nFrom (5,2), possible moves. Up is (4,2). Let's see what's around. Let me check row 5's columns. At column 2, can I move right? Column 3 is *, so no. Left? (5,1) is * (row 5 starts with **). So no. Down? Row 6, column 2. Row 6 is \"ooo*o*o*o*o\". Columns 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o. So column 2 is o. So moving down to (6,2). Direction 'down'. Now at (6,2). \n\nFrom here, possible directions. Up is (5,2). Let's check row 6. At (6,2), can I move right? Column 3 is *, so no. Left? Column 1 is o (since row 6 starts with ooo...). So (6,1) is o. But moving left from (6,2) to (6,1). How does that help? Let me think. Maybe from here, moving down again? Row 7, column 2. Row 7 is \"**o*o***o*o\". Let's parse it:\n\nColumns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o. So column 2 is o. So from (6,2), moving down to (7,2). Direction 'down'. Now at (7,2). \n\nFrom here, possible moves. Up is (6,2). Let's see. Row 7, column 2. Can I move right? Column 3 is * so no. Left? Column 1 is * (row 7 starts with **). Down? Row 8, column 2. Row 8 is \"ooo*ooo*o*o\". Let me parse: columns 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o. So column 2 is o. Moving down to (8,2). Direction 'down'. Now at (8,2).\n\nFrom (8,2), possible directions. Up to (7,2). Let's check. Can I move right? Column 3 is * (row 8's column 3 is *). So no. Left? Column 1 is o. So (8,1) is o. But again, how does that help? Down? Row 9, column 2. Row 9 is \"o***o***o*o\". Let me parse: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o. So column 2 is * (third character). So can't move down. So from (8,2), moving left to (8,1). Then from there?\n\nHmm, perhaps this path is getting stuck. Let me backtrack. Maybe there's a better way from (4,2). Earlier, at (4,2), instead of moving down to (5,2), maybe moving left to (4,1) and then...?\n\nLet me try that. At (4,2), moving left to (4,1). Now at (4,1). From here, can I move down? Let's check row 5, column 1. Row 5 is \"**o*o*o*o*o\" — columns 0 and 1 are *, so can't move down. Can I move left? (4,0)? Let me check row 4's column 0 is o. So (4,0) is o. From (4,1), moving left to (4,0). Then from there?\n\nAt (4,0), can I move down? Row 5, column 0 is * (row 5 starts with **). So no. Can I move up? (3,0) is * (row 3 starts with **). So no. Can I move right? Back to (4,1). Not helpful. Dead end again. So that path isn't working. Back to (4,2), maybe moving right isn't possible (it's a wall), so the only options were down or left. Both seem to lead to dead ends. So perhaps the path from (3,2) down to (4,2) isn't the right way. Maybe from (3,2), instead of going down, I should move right?\n\nWait, from (3,2), can I move right? Let's check. Row 3 is **o*o*o***o. At column 2 is o. Column 3 is * (as per earlier parsing). So moving right from (3,2) to (3,3) is blocked. So no. So from (3,2), only possible direction is down. So that leads us to (4,2), which seems problematic. Maybe there's another way from earlier steps.\n\nLet me backtrack again. Let's go back to when we were at (2,2). From there, we moved down to (3,2). But maybe from (2,2), instead of down, move right? Let's see. At (2,2), moving right to (2,3). Let me check row 2. Row 2 is o*ooooooooo. Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, etc. So yes, (2,3) is o. So from (2,2) move right to (2,3). Now directions would be adding 'right'.\n\nNow at (2,3). Let's explore from here. Possible moves: up (from (1,3)? Let me check row 1's column 3. Row 1 is o*o********. Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, then columns 3-10 are *. So (1,3) is *, so can't move up. So from (2,3), possible directions: down, left, right. Let's check.\n\nDown to (3,3): row 3's column 3 is * (as per earlier parsing). So blocked. Can't move down. Left to (2,2) — where we came from. Or move right to (2,4). Let me check row 2's column 4. Since row 2 is o*o followed by o's, yes. So (2,4) is o. So moving right to (2,4). Now at (2,4). From here, can I move further right? Let's see. (2,5) is o, etc. So perhaps proceed right as far as possible?\n\nLet me try moving right from (2,4) to (2,5), then (2,6), etc. Let me see how far I can go. Since row 2 is o*o followed by o's. The row is o * o o o o o o o o. Wait, original row 2 is \"o*ooooooooo\". So after column 2 (which is o), columns 3-10 are o's. So from (2,3) to (2,10). So from (2,3), moving all the way right to (2,10). But then from there, can I move down? Let me check row 3's column 10. Earlier parsing for row 3: the last character is o. So (3,10) is o. So from (2,10), moving down to (3,10). Let me try that path.\n\nSo path so far: from (0,0) → right, right → (0,2) → down, down → (2,2) → right → (2,3) → right multiple times to (2,10) → down to (3,10). Let me note the directions. From (2,2) to (2,3): right. Then from (2,3) to (2,10): right 7 times. Then down. So the directions would be adding 'right' seven times? Let me count. From (2,2) to (2,3) is one right. Then from (2,3) to (2,10): that's 7 more rights (columns 3 to 10 is 8 columns, minus 1 for the starting position, so 7 moves). So total of 8 rights? Wait, from (2,2) to (2,10) requires moving right 8 steps (from column 2 to 10 is 8 steps). Wait, column indices are 0-10. So 10 - 2 = 8 columns to the right. So 8 'right' moves. But earlier, we had already one right from (2,2) to (2,3), then seven more to reach (2,10). So total of 8 rights. Then down to (3,10).\n\nNow at (3,10). Let's check what's possible. From (3,10), possible directions: up (to (2,10)), left, down (to (4,10)? Let me check row 4's column 10. Row 4 is \"ooo*o*ooo*o\" → column 10 is o. So yes. So moving down to (4,10). Direction 'down'. Now at (4,10). From here, can I move down again? Row 5's column 10 is o (row 5 ends with o). So moving down to (5,10). Direction 'down'. Now at (5,10). From here, down to (6,10). Let me check row 6's column 10: o. Yes. So direction 'down'. Now at (6,10). Down to (7,10): row 7's column 10 is o (row 7 is \"**o*o***o*o\" → last character is o). Yes. Direction 'down'. Now at (7,10). Down to (8,10): row 8's column 10 is o (row 8 is \"ooo*ooo*o*o\" → column 10 is o). Yes. Direction 'down'. Now at (8,10). Down to (9,10): row 9's column 10 is o (row 9 is \"o***o***o*o\" → column 10 is o). Yes. Direction 'down'. Now at (9,10). Down to (10,10) which is X. So direction 'down'. Now we reach the destination. \n\nSo the path would be:\n\nStart at (0,0). Move right twice to (0,2). Then down twice to (2,2). Then right 8 times to (2,10). Then down 9 times to (10,10). But wait, let me count the down steps from (3,10) to (10,10). From row 3 to row 10 is 7 steps down (rows 3→4→5→6→7→8→9→10: 7 moves). So the directions would be:\n\n['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right' (8 times?), then 'down' 7 times. But let me check the exact steps.\n\nLet me retrace:\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\n1. right → (0,1)\n2. right → (0,2)\n3. down → (1,2)\n4. down → (2,2)\n5. right → (2,3)\n6. right → (2,4)\n7. right → (2,5)\n8. right → (2,6)\n9. right → (2,7)\n10. right → (2,8)\n11. right → (2,9)\n12. right → (2,10)\n13. down → (3,10)\n14. down → (4,10)\n15. down → (5,10)\n16. down → (6,10)\n17. down → (7,10)\n18. down → (8,10)\n19. down → (9,10)\n20. down → (10,10)\n\nSo that's 20 steps. The directions list would be:\n\n['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down'] ?\n\nWait, from step 5 to step 12 (steps 5-12 inclusive) is 8 'right's. Then from 13-20 is 8 'down's? Let me count steps 13-20. Steps 13: down to 3→4, step 14: 4→5, 15:5→6, 16:6→7, 17:7→8, 18:8→9, 19:9→10. Wait, that's 7 'down's. Because from row 3 to row 10 is 7 steps. So steps 13-19 (7 steps). Then step 20 is the final down? No, because from (9,10) to (10,10) is one more down. So total of 8 'down's after the rights.\n\nWait, step 13 is down from row 3 to 4 (step 1), step 14 to 5 (step 2), step 15 to 6 (3), step 16 to 7 (4), step 17 to 8 (5), step 18 to 9 (6), step 19 to 10 (7). So 7 'down's. Then from (9,10), moving down to (10,10) is step 20, which is the 8th 'down'. So yes, 8 'down's after the rights.\n\nSo the directions list is:\n\n['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', followed by 8 'right's, then 8 'down's].\n\nBut let me check if this path is valid. Let me verify each step.\n\nFrom (0,0) to (0,1): right. Valid.\n\n(0,1) to (0,2): right. Valid.\n\n(0,2) down to (1,2): valid, since row 1, column 2 is o.\n\n(1,2) down to (2,2): valid, row 2, column 2 is o.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (2,3): right. Valid.\n\n(2,3) to (2,4): right. Valid.\n\n... up to (2,10). All those steps are valid since row 2 from column 2 onwards is all o's.\n\nThen down from (2,10) to (3,10): row 3, column 10 is o (as per row 3's last character). Valid.\n\nThen down each row to (10,10). Each of those steps, the column 10 is o until row 10, which is X. So yes, this path works.\n\nBut wait, let me check row 9's column 10. Row 9 is \"o***o***o*o\". Let me parse the last part. The row is 11 characters. Let me check the last few columns. Assuming the row is structured as:\n\ncolumns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o. Yes. So column 10 is o. So from (9,10), moving down to (10,10) which is X. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to be a valid path. However, is this the correct path? Let me check if there are any walls in between. For example, when moving down from (2,10) to (3,10), is there a wall? Row 3's column 10 is o as per earlier analysis. Yes. So all steps are valid.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? Well, since the problem doesn't specify to find the shortest path, but to provide any valid path, this should be acceptable. However, perhaps there's a more efficient path. Let me think if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path that goes through the middle. But given the complexity of the maze, perhaps this right-down path is the easiest.\n\nBut let me check if there are any obstacles in this path. For example, when moving down from row 2 to row 3, column 10 is o. Yes. Then each subsequent row's column 10 is o until row 10. Let me check row 7's column 10. Row 7 is \"**o*o***o*o\". The last character is o. Yes. Row 8: \"ooo*ooo*o*o\" → column 10 is o. Row 9: as discussed. Row 10 is the destination. So yes, this path works.\n\nTherefore, the directions list would be as follows:\n\n['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']\n\nBut let me count the exact number of moves. Let's see:\n\nFrom step 1 to step 20:\n\nTotal steps: 20 steps. But how many directions? Each move is one direction. So the list has 20 elements. Let me count:\n\n- Initial 2 rights: 2\n- Then 2 downs: 2 → total 4\n- Then 8 rights: 8 → total 12\n- Then 8 downs: 8 → total 20.\n\nYes. So the list is as above.\n\nBut let me check if there's any mistake. For example, when moving from (2,2) to (2,10), that's 8 rights (columns 2 to 10: 8 steps). Let me confirm:\n\nColumn indices: 2 → 3 (1), 4 (2), 5 (3), 6 (4), 7 (5), 8 (6), 9 (7), 10 (8). Yes, 8 steps. So 8 'right's. Then 8 'down's. So the list is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path. For example, perhaps there's a way to go right and down alternately to reach faster. But given the maze's structure, perhaps not. For example, maybe there's a way to go down earlier and avoid some of the long rights. Let me think.\n\nAlternative approach: from (0,0) move down to (1,0), then right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), then proceed as before. Let me see.\n\n(0,0) down → (1,0). Then right to (1,1) is blocked (it's *). So can't. From (1,0), move right to (1,2) (since column 1 is *, but column 2 is o). So from (1,0) to (1,2) requires moving right twice. So directions: down, right, right. Then down to (2,2). Then same as before. This would add some steps but perhaps allows for a different path. However, the total steps might be similar.\n\nBut regardless, the initial path I found seems valid. So the answer would be the list of directions as described.\n\nAnother thing to check: the starting point is (0,0), which is 'I', and the end is (10,10), which is 'X'. The path moves through all 'o's and reaches X. So this should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the list of directions as outlined.\n ;Answer: ['right','right','down','down','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this maze and find the path from 'I' to 'X'. The maze is 9x9, right? Let me start by visualizing the maze based on the input given.\n\nFirst, let me write down the maze grid to understand where the walls and open paths are. The input is given as 9 lines:\n\nLine 1: Ioooooooo\nLine 2: o*****o**\nLine 3: ooooo*ooo\nLine 4: o***o****\nLine 5: ooo*ooooo\nLine 6: o*o***o**\nLine 7: o*o*o*ooo\nLine 8: o***o*o*o\nLine 9: o*ooooo*X\n\nWait, each line is 9 characters? Let me check. For example, the first line is \"Ioooooooo\"—so starts with I followed by 8 o's. Then line 2: o*****o**—that's o followed by 5 *, then o, then two *? But that's only 1+5+1+2=9? Wait, 1+5=6, plus 1 is 7, plus 2 makes 9. Yes. So each line is 9 characters.\n\nNow I need to map this into a grid. Let me represent each row as a list of characters. Let me note down each row:\n\nRow 0 (assuming 0-based index): I o o o o o o o o\nRow 1: o * * * * * o * *\nRow 2: o o o o o * o o o\nRow 3: o * * * o * * * *\nRow 4: o o o * o o o o o\nRow 5: o * o * * * o * *\nRow 6: o * o * o * o o o\nRow 7: o * * * o * o * o\nRow 8: o * o o o o o * X\n\nWait, the last line is o*ooooo*X. So that's o, *, then oooooo (six o's?), then * and X. Let me check the count. Let me parse row 8:\n\nRow 8: positions 0 to 8:\n\n0: o\n1: *\n2: o\n3: o\n4: o\n5: o\n6: o\n7: *\n8: X\n\nYes. So the X is at (8,8) in row 8, column 8. The start is at (0,0), which is row 0, column 0.\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (8,8), moving up, down, left, right, avoiding walls (*). The path can only go through 'o's, the start (I), and the end (X). Also, the start and end are considered passable.\n\nSo I need to perform some kind of pathfinding algorithm. Since the user wants the path as a list of directions, I need to find a valid path. Let me think about how to approach this manually, since implementing BFS or DFS here is not possible, but maybe I can simulate it.\n\nFirst, let me note the start position. Starting at (0,0). Let me try to map out possible paths.\n\nLooking at row 0: it's all o's except the first cell is I. So from (0,0), possible moves are right (to (0,1)), or down (to (1,0)). Let me check what's in (1,0). Row 1, column 0 is 'o', so that's allowed. So down is possible. But let's see.\n\nBut perhaps the best approach is to sketch the maze mentally and try to find a path.\n\nLet me try to outline the maze:\n\nRow 0: [I][o][o][o][o][o][o][o][o]\nRow 1: [o][*][*][*][*][*][o][*][*]\nRow 2: [o][o][o][o][o][*][o][o][o]\nRow 3: [o][*][*][*][o][*][*][*][*]\nRow 4: [o][o][o][*][o][o][o][o][o]\nRow 5: [o][*][o][*][*][*][o][*][*]\nRow 6: [o][*][o][*][o][*][o][o][o]\nRow 7: [o][*][*][*][o][*][o][*][o]\nRow 8: [o][*][o][o][o][o][o][*][X]\n\nSo, starting at (0,0). Let me think of possible paths.\n\nFirst, from (0,0), can move right or down. Let me try down first. Moving down to (1,0). From (1,0), can we move down again? Let's check row 2, column 0: it's 'o', so yes. So moving down to (2,0). Then again down to (3,0): which is 'o'? Row 3, column 0 is 'o'? Yes. Then down to (4,0): 'o' again. Then down to (5,0): row 5, column 0 is 'o'? Yes. Then down to (6,0): 'o'? Row 6, column 0 is 'o'—yes. Then down to (7,0): 'o' again. Then down to (8,0): 'o' here. From here, can we move right? Let's see. (8,0) is o. Then (8,1) is *, so no. So from (8,0), can only go up or right (but right is blocked). So up back. But this path seems to lead nowhere. Maybe this down path is not useful. Let me backtrack.\n\nAlternative approach: from (0,0), move right. Let's see. So starting at (0,0), moving right to (0,1), then (0,2), etc. But need to check for walls. But row 0 is all o's. So perhaps moving right all the way? But maybe there's a way to go down at some point.\n\nBut looking at row 0, column 0. If I move right, I can go to (0,1). But perhaps there's a better way. Let me think about possible paths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the path requires a combination of moving right and down. Let me try to find a path step by step.\n\nLet me try to map coordinates as (row, column). The start is (0,0). Let's try to find a path.\n\nOption 1:\n\nStart at (0,0). Let's try moving down as much as possible until we can't. Let's see:\n\n(0,0) down to (1,0). Then down to (2,0). Then down to (3,0). Then down to (4,0). Then down to (5,0). Then down to (6,0). Then down to (7,0). Then down to (8,0). From there, can't go right because (8,1) is *. So from (8,0), maybe go up. But that's backtracking. Let's see. From (8,0), maybe go up to (7,0). From there, can we move right? Let's check row 7, column 0: o. Moving right to (7,1) is *, blocked. So no. So this path seems stuck. So maybe moving down from the start isn't the way.\n\nAlternative approach: from (0,0), move right to (0,1), then maybe down when possible.\n\nLooking at row 0, all the way to column 8. But perhaps there's a way to go down into row 1. Let's see. At (0,0), moving right to (0,1). Then down to (1,1) is *, which is blocked. So can't go down there. So maybe moving further right. Let's see. From (0,0) moving right to (0,1), then right again to (0,2), which is o. Still in row 0. Let's go to (0,3), same. (0,4), etc. Let's say we go all the way to (0,5), but then down would be row 1, column 5, which is * (row 1, column 5 is *). So blocked. So maybe moving further right. Let's go to (0,6). From (0,6), down to row 1, column 6 is o. Because row 1's column 6 is o. Let me check row 1: [o, *, *, *, *, *, o, *, *]. Yes, column 6 is o. So from (0,6) down to (1,6). Then what?\n\nAt (1,6), possible moves: up (back to 0,6), down to (2,6) which is o (row 2, column 6 is o?), row 2's column 6 is o? Let me check row 2: [o, o, o, o, o, *, o, o, o]. Yes, column 6 is o. So down to (2,6). Then maybe further down? Let's see. From (2,6), down to (3,6). Row 3, column 6 is *? Let me check row 3: [o, *, *, *, o, *, *, *, *]. Column 6 is *, so no. So can't go down. So perhaps from (2,6), move left or right. Let's see. From (2,6), moving left to (2,5) is *, blocked. Moving right to (2,7) is o. So yes. So moving right to (2,7). Then from there, maybe down? (3,7) is *? Row 3, column 7 is *? Yes, row 3's column 7 is *, so blocked. So can't go down. So from (2,7), can move right to (2,8) which is o. Then down? Let me check (3,8): row 3, column 8 is *? Yes. So can't go down. So stuck here. Maybe backtrack. From (2,8), can go up? No. Left? Back to (2,7). Hmm.\n\nThis path seems to hit a dead end. Maybe need to find another way. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's try to find the path from the start, moving in a way that avoids the walls. Maybe using BFS-like logic.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the path goes through row 0 to some point, then down, then navigate around the walls.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 6 is o. So from (0,6), down to (1,6) as before. Then from (1,6), can we go left? Let's see. (1,6) is in row 1. To the left, columns 5, 4, etc. But row 1 from column 1 to 5 is all *s. So from (1,6), moving left to (1,5) is *, blocked. So only possible directions are up (back to row 0), down (to row 2, column 6), or right. So maybe down to row 2, column 6 as before. Then from there, perhaps moving left? Let's see. From (2,6), moving left to (2,5) is * blocked. So can't. So from (2,6), moving right to (2,7) as before. Then from (2,7), moving right to (2,8). Then down is blocked. So maybe up? No. Or left?\n\nAlternatively, from (2,6), maybe move up? Back to (1,6). Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe this path isn't working. Let me think of another way.\n\nWhat if from (0,0), I move right to (0,1), then (0,2), (0,3)... up to (0,4). Let's check. From (0,4), down to row 1, column 4 is *? Row 1, column 4 is *, yes. So can't go down. So maybe move further right. Let's go to (0,5). Down to row 1, column 5 is *, blocked. (0,6) as before. So maybe that's the only way down from row 0.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's try to find a path that goes down early. From (0,0), down to (1,0). Then right? Let's see. (1,0) is o. From there, can move right to (1,1) which is *, blocked. So can't. So must move down again to (2,0). Then from (2,0), right? Let me check. (2,0) is o. Moving right to (2,1) is o. So yes. From (2,0) to (2,1). Then maybe continue right. Let me see:\n\nFrom (2,0) to (2,1) to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) is *, so can't go there. So up to column 4. Let me think:\n\nAt (2,4), which is o. From there, can we move down? (3,4) is o? Let me check row 3: column 4 is o? Row 3 is [o,*,*,*,o,*,*,*,*]. Yes, column 4 is o. So from (2,4), down to (3,4). Now at (3,4). From here, what's possible? Let's see. Row 3, column 4 is o. Can move up (back to 2,4), down? (4,4) is o? Row 4: column 4 is o? Row 4 is [o, o, o, *, o, o, o, o, o]. Yes, column 4 is o. So down to (4,4). From there, maybe move down again to (5,4). Let me check row 5, column 4: it's *? Row 5 is [o, *, o, *, *, *, o, *, *]. Column 4 is *, yes. So blocked. So can't go down. From (4,4), can move left or right. Let's check.\n\nFrom (4,4), moving left to (4,3) is *, blocked. Moving right to (4,5): o. So yes. From (4,5), can move further right. Let's go to (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8). All are o's in row 4. So from (4,8), maybe go down? (5,8) is *? Row 5, column 8 is *, yes. Or up? Not helpful. Or left?\n\nBut how to get from here to the destination. Maybe this path is going the wrong way.\n\nLet me recap the path so far:\n\nStart → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) → down to (3,4) → down to (4,4) → right to (4,5), etc. Now at (4,8). From here, can move up? No. Down is blocked. So maybe need to backtrack.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,4), after moving right to (4,5), maybe go down when possible. Let me check. From (4,5), down to (5,5). Row 5, column 5 is o? Let me check row 5: [o, *, o, *, *, *, o, *, *]. Column 5 is o? Yes. So (5,5) is o. From there, can move down to (6,5)? Row 6, column 5 is *? Row 6: [o, *, o, *, o, *, o, o, o]. Column 5 is *, so blocked. So can't go down. From (5,5), can move left or right. Let's try moving left to (5,4) which is *, blocked. So can't. Moving right to (5,6): o. Yes. From (5,6), can move down to (6,6)? Row 6, column 6 is o. Yes. From (6,6), can move down to (7,6). Row 7, column 6 is o? Let me check row 7: [o, *, *, *, o, *, o, *, o]. Column 6 is o. Yes. Then down to (8,6). Row 8, column 6 is o. From there, can we move right? (8,7) is *, blocked. So can't. Left? (8,5) is o. Let me see. From (8,6), moving left to (8,5), then to (8,4), (8,3), (8,2). All o's? Let me check row 8: columns 2 is o, 3 is o, 4 is o, 5 is o, 6 is o, 7 is *, 8 is X. So yes. From (8,6), moving left to (8,5), then left to (8,4), etc. But how to get from there to X at (8,8). From (8,6), can't go right because of *, but perhaps there's another way up.\n\nFrom (8,6), moving up to (7,6). From (7,6), can move right? (7,7) is *, blocked. Or left to (7,5) which is *, blocked. Or up to (6,6). From (6,6), can move left to (6,4)? Let me think. From (6,6), moving left to (6,5) is *, blocked. So no. Or up to (5,6). From (5,6), can move up to (4,6). From (4,6), can go left or right. Maybe this is getting too convoluted. Perhaps there's a better path.\n\nLet me try to track this path again:\n\nStart → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,4) → down to (3,4) → down to (4,4) → right to (4,5) → down to (5,5) → right to (5,6) → down to (6,6) → down to (7,6) → down to (8,6). Now at (8,6). From here, need to reach X at (8,8). Let's see if there's a way from (8,6) to X.\n\nFrom (8,6), moving up to (7,6). From there, can we move right? (7,7) is *, blocked. So no. From (7,6), can move up to (6,6). From (6,6), can move up to (5,6). From (5,6), can move up to (4,6). From (4,6), maybe move left to (4,3)? No, blocked. Or move right to (4,7), (4,8). From (4,8), maybe go up to (3,8)? Which is *? Yes. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nThis seems stuck. Maybe this path isn't working. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nLet me try to look for possible paths from the end. The destination is at (8,8). Let's see what's around it. The cell to the left is (8,7) which is *, so can't come from there. The cell above is (7,8). Let me check row 7, column 8: it's o. So from (7,8) can go down to (8,8). So how to get to (7,8). Let's look at (7,8). From there, how to reach it. Let's see. (7,8) is in row 7, column 8. To get there, maybe from (7,7) but that's *, or from (6,8). Let's check row 6, column 8 is o. So from (6,8) can go down to (7,8). How to get to (6,8). From (6,8), maybe from (6,7) which is o? Let me check row 6, column 7 is o. So from (6,7) right to (6,8). How to get to (6,7). From (5,7) which is *? Or from (6,6) which is o. From (6,6) can move right to (6,7). So path from (6,6) → right → (6,7) → right → (6,8) → down → (7,8) → down → X. So how to get to (6,6).\n\nLet me try to work backwards. Let's see:\n\nPath from X is up from (7,8), then up from (6,8), then left from (6,7), then left from (6,6). Now, how to get to (6,6). Let's see. From (5,6) down? (5,6) is o. From (5,6) down to (6,6). How to get to (5,6). From (5,5) right? Or from (4,6) down. Let's see.\n\nIf I can find a way to reach (5,6), then proceed.\n\nLet me try to find a path to (5,6). Let's think forward again.\n\nEarlier, I had a path that reached (5,5) and then moved right to (5,6). Let's see if that's possible. Let me try to retrace that.\n\nStarting from (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,4) → down to (3,4) → down to (4,4) → right to (4,5) → down to (5,5) → right to (5,6). Yes. So from there, down to (6,6), etc. So then from (6,6) → right → (6,7) → right → (6,8) → down → (7,8) → down → X. That would be a valid path. Let me check if that works.\n\nLet me verify each step:\n\nFrom (5,6) down to (6,6): yes, row 6, column 6 is o.\n\nFrom (6,6) right to (6,7): yes, row 6, column 7 is o.\n\nFrom (6,7) right to (6,8): yes, row 6, column 8 is o.\n\nFrom (6,8) down to (7,8): yes, row 7, column 8 is o.\n\nFrom (7,8) down to (8,8): X. Yes.\n\nSo that's a valid path from (5,6) to X. Now, the question is, can we reach (5,6) from the start?\n\nYes, as per the earlier steps. So let me now outline the entire path.\n\nLet me write down the coordinates step by step, then convert to directions.\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nPath steps:\n\n(0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,1) → right to (2,2) → right to (2,3) → right to (2,4) → down to (3,4) → down to (4,4) → right to (4,5) → down to (5,5) → right to (5,6) → down to (6,6) → right to (6,7) → right to (6,8) → down to (7,8) → down to (8,8).\n\nNow, converting these coordinate changes into directions.\n\nLet me list each move:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): down.\n\n(1,0) to (2,0): down.\n\n(2,0) to (2,1): right.\n\n(2,1) to (2,2): right.\n\n(2,2) to (2,3): right.\n\n(2,3) to (2,4): right.\n\n(2,4) to (3,4): down.\n\n(3,4) to (4,4): down.\n\n(4,4) to (4,5): right.\n\n(4,5) to (5,5): down.\n\n(5,5) to (5,6): right.\n\n(5,6) to (6,6): down.\n\n(6,6) to (6,7): right.\n\n(6,7) to (6,8): right.\n\n(6,8) to (7,8): down.\n\n(7,8) to (8,8): down.\n\nSo the list of directions is:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter or more optimal path, but since the user didn't specify shortest path, any valid path is acceptable. However, perhaps there's a better way.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step for validity.\n\nLet me check each move:\n\nFrom (0,0) down to (1,0): valid.\n\n(1,0) down to (2,0): valid.\n\n(2,0) right to (2,1): valid.\n\n(2,1) right to (2,2): valid.\n\n(2,2) right to (2,3): valid.\n\n(2,3) right to (2,4): valid.\n\n(2,4) down to (3,4): valid (row 3, column 4 is o).\n\n(3,4) down to (4,4): valid (row 4, column 4 is o).\n\n(4,4) right to (4,5): valid.\n\n(4,5) down to (5,5): valid (row 5, column 5 is o).\n\n(5,5) right to (5,6): valid (row 5, column 6 is o).\n\n(5,6) down to (6,6): valid (row 6, column 6 is o).\n\n(6,6) right to (6,7): valid (row 6, column 7 is o).\n\n(6,7) right to (6,8): valid (row 6, column 8 is o).\n\n(6,8) down to (7,8): valid (row 7, column 8 is o).\n\n(7,8) down to (8,8): valid.\n\nYes, all steps are valid. So this path works.\n\nNow, converting this into the required list of directions. The answer is the list of moves taken.\n\nBut let me check if there's a more optimal path. For example, maybe there's a way to avoid some of the right moves by taking a different route.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path that goes from the start rightwards more and takes a different route. But since this path works, perhaps this is acceptable.\n\nBut let me think if there's a shorter path. For example, maybe from (0,0), moving right to (0,6), then down to (1,6), then down to (2,6), then right to (2,7), (2,8), then down? But earlier I thought that (3,8) is blocked. Let me check.\n\nFrom (2,8), down to (3,8) which is * (row 3, column 8 is *). So no. But perhaps from (2,8), move down to row 2, but that's not possible. So that path is blocked. So the previous path is better.\n\nAnother possible path: from (0,0) → right to (0,6) → down to (1,6) → down to (2,6) → left to (2,5) is blocked. No. So from (2,6), can move right to (2,7), then down to (3,7)? Row 3, column 7 is *? Yes. So no. So stuck again. So the earlier path is better.\n\nTherefore, the path I outlined seems valid. Now, let me write the directions as per the steps.\n\nThe directions list is:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']\n\nBut let me count the steps to make sure:\n\nNumber of steps: from start to end is 16 moves. The list has 16 elements. Let me count the steps again:\n\nStart (0,0) to (1,0): 1 (down)\n\n(1,0) to (2,0): 2 (down)\n\n(2,0) to (2,1): 3 (right)\n\n(2,1) to (2,2): 4 (right)\n\n(2,2) to (2,3): 5 (right)\n\n(2,3) to (2,4): 6 (right)\n\n(2,4) to (3,4): 7 (down)\n\n(3,4) to (4,4): 8 (down)\n\n(4,4) to (4,5): 9 (right)\n\n(4,5) to (5,5): 10 (down)\n\n(5,5) to (5,6): 11 (right)\n\n(5,6) to (6,6): 12 (down)\n\n(6,6) to (6,7): 13 (right)\n\n(6,7) to (6,8): 14 (right)\n\n(6,8) to (7,8): 15 (down)\n\n(7,8) to (8,8): 16 (down)\n\nYes, 16 moves. So the list is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's any mistake in the directions. For example, when moving from (2,0) to (2,4), that's four right moves. Correct. Then down twice, etc.\n\nYes, seems correct.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\nAnswer: ['down','down','right','right','right','right','down','down','right','down','right','down','right','right','down','down']\n\nBut perhaps there's a more optimal path. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative path: From (0,0), move right to (0,5) is not possible because down from there is blocked. But what if from (0,0), move right to (0,6), down to (1,6), then down to (2,6). From there, move left to (2,5) is blocked. So can't. So from (2,6), move right to (2,7), then right to (2,8). From there, down is blocked. But perhaps up to (1,8) which is *? No. Or left? So stuck. So no. So the previous path is better.\n\nAnother idea: From (0,0), move right to (0,1), then down to (1,1) is blocked. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,0), move down to (1,0), then right to (1, ... but (1,1) is *.\n\nSo the earlier path seems the only viable one.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','right','right','right','right','down','down','right','down','right','down','right','right','down','down']"

      "Okay, let's try to solve this maze. First, I need to figure out the starting point and the destination. The start is marked with 'I' and the end with 'X'. The maze is 13x13, I think. Let me check the input again. The user provided a 13-line maze, each line being 13 characters? Let me count. The first line is \"Ioooooooooo*o\" — that's 14 characters? Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check:\n\nEach line of the maze is given as a string. Let's take the first line: I followed by o's and then * and o. Let me count the characters. Let's see: I o o o o o o o o o * o — that's 1 (I) + 9 o's + * + o = 1+9+1+1= 12? Wait, maybe each line is 13 characters. Let me recount. Let me take the first line:\n\n\"Ioooooooooo*o\" — breaking it down:\n\nI (1), then 9 o's (positions 2-10?), then a *, then an o. So total is 1 + 9 + 1 + 1 = 12? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Maybe each line is 13 characters. Let me check another line. For example, the second line is \"o*o***o*****o\". Let's count:\n\no * o * * * o * * * * * o — that's 13 characters? Let's count each: 1, 2, 3,... yes, 13. So each line is 13 characters. So the first line must also be 13. Let me check again: \"Ioooooooooo*o\" — I followed by 9 o's? Let me see: I (1), then o (positions 2-10: 9 o's?), then *, then o. So 1 + 9 + 1 + 1 = 12? Wait, that's 12. Oh, maybe there's a typo? Or maybe I miscounted. Let me write it out:\n\nPositions 1: I\n2: o\n3: o\n4: o\n5: o\n6: o\n7: o\n8: o\n9: o\n10: o\n11: o\nWait, that's 10 o's after the I? Because from position 2 to 11, that's 10 o's. Then comes a * and then an o. So total is 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 13? Yes. Oh right! Because I is position 1, then 10 o's (positions 2-11), then * (position 12), then o (position 13). So that's correct. So each line is 13 characters. Got it.\n\nNow, the start is the position of 'I' in the first line. So in row 0 (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), or row 1? Let me think. The first line is given as the first line of the maze. Let's assume rows are numbered from 0 to 12 (since 13 rows), and columns 0 to 12 as well. The starting point is at (row 0, column 0). Wait, first line is \"Ioooooooooo*o\", so the first character is 'I' at column 0, row 0. The destination 'X' is at the last line, somewhere. Let me check the last line: \"o*ooo*ooooooX\". The last character is X. So in row 12 (assuming 0-based), column 12.\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (12,12), moving up, down, left, right, through cells that are 'o', avoiding ' * '.\n\nSo, how to approach this? Well, maybe perform a BFS (breadth-first search) to find the shortest path. But since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can try to trace a path.\n\nLet me start by visualizing the maze. Let me try to write down the maze structure, but since it's tedious, I'll try to think step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). The first cell. Let's look at the first row:\n\nRow 0: I (0,0) followed by o's until column 10 (which is o?), then * at column 11, then o at column 12. Wait, the first row is I followed by 10 o's? Let me confirm again. The first line is \"Ioooooooooo*o\". Let's count the o's after I. Let's see:\n\nAfter I, there are 9 o's? Or 10? Let me count the letters:\n\nI o o o o o o o o o * o — that's 1 I, then 9 o's, then *, then o. So total 1+9+1+1= 12? But that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the line is \"I\" followed by 9 o's, then a *, then 2 o's? No, the line ends with *o. So maybe the line is I followed by 9 o's, then *, then o. Which would be 1+9+1+1= 12. But since each line is 13 characters, perhaps there's an error in my counting. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Let me write the first line as:\n\nIndices 0-12:\n\n0: I\n\nThen positions 1-10: o's? Let's see: positions 0 (I), then 1: o, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o. Then position 11 is *, position 12 is o. So that's 1 (I) + 10 o's (positions 1-10) + * (11) + o (12). So yes, 13 characters. So in row 0, columns 0 to 12, the starting point is (0,0), and from there, can we move right? Because column 0 is I, then column 1 is o. So first step could be to move right.\n\nBut perhaps I need to map out the maze more carefully. However, since it's a 13x13 maze, it's quite big. Let me try to find a path step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's see possible moves. From (0,0), can we go down or right? Because up is out of the maze, left is out. So first, check the adjacent cells.\n\nAt (0,0), possible directions:\n\n- Right: (0,1) is o. So can move right.\n\n- Down: (1,0) is o? Let's check row 1 (second line of the input): \"o*o***o*****o\". So row 1, column 0 is 'o'. So yes. So from (0,0), can move down to (1,0) or right to (0,1).\n\nBut since the maze is complex, perhaps the best approach is to try to find a path that avoids the walls. Let me try to outline possible steps.\n\nBut doing this manually is error-prone. Let me think of possible paths.\n\nLet me start by trying to move right from the start. Let's say I go right as much as possible until I hit the wall. The first row has a wall at column 11 (position 11 is *, then column 12 is o. So maybe proceed right until column 12? But from (0,0), moving right step by step:\n\n(0,0) → right → (0,1) → right → ... up to (0, 12). But in the first row, after moving right 12 times, we reach (0,12). But is that allowed? Let me check the first row: the last character is 'o', so yes. So perhaps that's a possible path. But then, from (0,12), can we move down? Let's check row 1, column 12: the second line ends with 'o', so (1,12) is o. So from (0,12), moving down to (1,12). But let's check if that's possible. However, maybe there are walls in between. For example, moving from (0,0) all the way right to (0,12) would require that all cells from (0,0) to (0,12) are passable. The first line is I followed by o's except for column 11 being * and column 12 being o. Wait, so columns 0 to 10 are o's? Let me check again. The first line is I followed by 10 o's? Wait, original line is \"Ioooooooooo*o\". Let me count the o's after I. Let's see:\n\n\"I\" followed by \"oooooooooo\" (that's 10 o's?), then * then o. So yes. So columns 0 (I), columns 1-10 are o, column 11 is *, column 12 is o. Therefore, from (0,0), moving right all the way to (0,12) would require moving through columns 0→1→...→10 (all o's), then column 11 is *, which is a wall. So you can't go from (0,10) to (0,11) because column 11 is a wall. Therefore, the maximum right you can go in row 0 is to column 10 (o), then column 11 is blocked. So from (0,10), you can't go right. Therefore, perhaps the initial path is to go right to (0,10), then need to go down or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down first. Let me think.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's try moving down. Row 1, column 0 is 'o' (from the second line: first character is o). Then row 2, column 0: third line is \"o*ooo*ooooooo\" — first character is o. So (2,0) is o. Let me check the third line's first character. Yes, the third line starts with o. Continuing down: row 3, column 0: fourth line starts with o? Let's check the fourth line: \"o*********o**\" — first character is o. So yes. Row 4, column 0: fifth line starts with o (\"ooooooooo*ooo\"). So yes. Continuing down until where?\n\nLet me check each row's first column:\n\nRow 0: (0,0) I\n\nRow 1: o\n\nRow 2: o\n\nRow 3: o\n\nRow 4: o\n\nRow 5: **o***o*o**** — first character is *? Wait the fifth line is row 4? Wait the user provided the maze as:\n\nMaze Board:\n\nLine 1: Ioooooooooo*o\n\nLine 2: o*o***o*****o\n\nLine 3: o*ooo*ooooooo\n\nLine 4: o*********o**\n\nLine 5: ooooooooo*ooo\n\nLine 6: **o***o*o****\n\nLine 7: ooooo*o*ooooo\n\nLine 8: o*o*o***o****\n\nLine 9: o*o*o*o*ooo*o\n\nLine 10: o*o*o*o*****o\n\nLine 11: o*o*ooooo*ooo\n\nLine 12: o*o*****o*o**\n\nWait, the user provided 13 lines. Let me index them from 0 to 12.\n\nRow 0: Ioooooooooo*o\n\nRow 1: o*o***o*****o\n\nRow 2: o*ooo*ooooooo\n\nRow 3: o*********o**\n\nRow 4: ooooooooo*ooo\n\nRow 5: **o***o*o****\n\nRow 6: ooooo*o*ooooo\n\nRow 7: o*o*o***o****\n\nRow 8: o*o*o*o*ooo*o\n\nRow 9: o*o*o*o*****o\n\nRow 10: o*o*ooooo*ooo\n\nRow 11: o*o*****o*o**\n\nRow 12: o*o*ooooooX\n\nWait, the last line is \"o*ooo*ooooooX\". Let me check row 12's first character: o, then * etc., ending with X.\n\nSo, for column 0 in each row:\n\nRow 0: I (0,0)\n\nRow 1: o (1,0)\n\nRow 2: o (2,0)\n\nRow 3: o (3,0)\n\nRow 4: o (4,0)\n\nRow 5: **o***o*o**** → first character is *? Let me check row 5 (the sixth line in the input, which is \"**o***o*o****\"). The first two characters are **, so (5,0) is * (wall). Therefore, cannot move down beyond row 4 in column 0. So from row 4, column 0, moving down to row 5, column 0 is blocked. So if I try to go down from (0,0) all the way, I can go down to row 4, column 0, then can't go further down. So from (4,0), what options are there? Let's see.\n\nAt row 4, column 0 (o). From there, can move right, up, or down (but down is blocked). So moving right. Let's explore that path later. But perhaps there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of possible paths. Since the maze is complex, perhaps I need to find a way that snakes through the open spaces.\n\nLet me try to outline possible steps.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let me try to go right first. So from (0,0) move right to (0,1). Then continue right as far as possible. Let's see:\n\n(0,0) → right → (0,1) → ... up to (0,10). Then column 11 is *, so can't go further. From (0,10), possible moves: down or left. Let's try down. From (0,10), moving down to (1,10). Let's check what's there. Row 1, column 10: looking at row 1's string: \"o*o***o*****o\". Let's parse this row. Let me write it out as characters:\n\nRow 1: [o, *, o, *, *, *, o, *, *, *, *, o]\n\nWait, that's 13 characters. Let me index columns 0-12:\n\nRow 1:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: *\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: *\n\n9: *\n\n10: * ?\n\nWait, original string is \"o*o***o*****o\". Let me split:\n\no * o * * * o * * * * * o ?\n\nYes. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: *, 11: *, 12: o.\n\nTherefore, at (1,10) is * (wall). So from (0,10), moving down to (1,10) is a wall. Not allowed. So that's blocked. Therefore, from (0,10), can't move down. What about left? From (0,10), moving left would take us back towards column 0. But that's the way we came. Not helpful. Or perhaps up? No, since we're at row 0. So maybe from (0,10), need to move down to a different column. Wait, perhaps there's a column where moving down is possible. For example, column 11 is a wall, but maybe column 12? From (0,12), which is o. How do I get there? Well, from (0,10), can't go right to (0,11) because it's a wall. So maybe need to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (0,0), instead of going all the way right, go down first. Let's try that. From (0,0), move down to (1,0). Then down again to (2,0), then to (3,0), then (4,0). As discussed earlier, can't go further down. From (4,0), can we move right? Let's check row 4's columns. Row 4 is \"ooooooooo*ooo\". Let me parse it:\n\nRow 4: columns 0-12:\n\n0: o\n\n1: o\n\n2: o\n\n3: o\n\n4: o\n\n5: o\n\n6: o\n\n7: o\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: o\n\n11: o\n\n12: o\n\nSo from (4,0), moving right is possible. Let's go right step by step. Let's say from (4,0), move right to (4,1), then to (4,2), etc. Let's see how far we can go. The row has a * at column 9. So up to column 8, it's o. From column 9 is blocked. So from (4,0), moving right to column 8, then can't go further. From there, maybe down or up. Let's see.\n\nAt (4,8), can move down to (5,8). Let's check what's there. Row 5 is \"**o***o*o****\". Let me parse row 5:\n\nRow 5: columns 0-12:\n\n0: *\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: *\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: *\n\n11: *\n\n12: *\n\nSo at column 8 of row 5 is o. So yes, (5,8) is o. So from (4,8), moving down to (5,8). Now, from (5,8), what can we do? Let's see. Let's look at row 5's data again. At (5,8) is o. Let's check surrounding cells.\n\nPossible moves from (5,8):\n\n- Up: back to (4,8).\n\n- Down: row 6, column 8. Row 6 is \"ooooo*o*ooooo\". Let me parse row 6:\n\nRow 6: columns 0-12:\n\n0: o\n\n1: o\n\n2: o\n\n3: o\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: o\n\n10: o\n\n11: o\n\n12: o\n\nSo column 8 of row 6 is o. So from (5,8), moving down to (6,8) is possible. Let's proceed.\n\nNow at (6,8). Let's see. From here, can move in any direction. Let's try to move further. Let's think: perhaps move right? Let's check row 6 from column 8 onwards. At (6,8) is o. Column 9 is o, column 10 is o, etc. So can move right to (6,9), (6,10), etc. Let's see. Maybe proceed right as far as possible. Let's say from (6,8) move right to (6,12). But need to check for walls. In row 6, columns 5 is *, but columns 8-12 are o's (as per the row: \"ooooo*o*ooooo\" — let me confirm. The row is \"ooooo*o*ooooo\". Breaking down:\n\nColumns 0-4: o's. Column 5: *, column 6: o, column 7: *, then columns 8-12: o's. Yes. So from (6,8), moving right all the way to (6,12) is possible. Then from there, can we move down?\n\nRow 7, column 12: let's check row 7's data. Row 7 is \"o*o*o***o****\". Let me parse:\n\nRow 7: columns 0-12:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: *\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: *\n\n11: *\n\n12: *\n\nSo column 12 of row 7 is *, so can't move down from (6,12) to (7,12). What about moving up? From (6,12), up is row 5, column 12. Row 5's column 12 is * (from earlier analysis of row 5). So can't move up. So from (6,12), need to find another direction. Let's see. Maybe move left? Let's think. From (6,12), perhaps move left to (6,11), then down? Let's check.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better path. Let me backtrack a bit. From (6,8), moving right to (6,12), then maybe from there, moving down to row 7, column 8? Let's check row 7, column 8: it's o. Yes. So from (6,8), moving down to (7,8). Let me check row 7, column 8: yes, it's o. So from (6,8), down to (7,8). Now, at (7,8). Let's look at row 7's data again. From column 8, which is o. Let's see what's around here. From (7,8), can we move further?\n\nLooking at row 7's columns:\n\nAt (7,8) is o. Let's check surrounding cells. To the right, column 9 is *, so can't go right. To the left, column 7 is * (row 7, column 7 is *). So from (7,8), can move up or down. Let's check moving down to row 8, column 8. Row 8 is \"o*o*o*o*ooo*o\". Let me parse row 8:\n\nRow 8: columns 0-12:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: o\n\n10: o\n\n11: o\n\n12: *\n\nSo column 8 of row 8 is o. So from (7,8), moving down to (8,8). Now at (8,8). Let's check what's here. From row 8, column 8 is o. Let's look around. From here, can move right? Column 9 is o, column 10 is o, column 11 is o, column 12 is *. So yes, can move right to (8,9), (8,10), (8,11). Let's proceed right to (8,11). From there, perhaps move down. Let's check row 9, column 11. Row 9 is \"o*o*o*o*****o\". Let me parse row 9:\n\nRow 9: columns 0-12:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: *\n\n11: *\n\n12: o\n\nSo column 11 of row 9 is *. So from (8,11), moving down to (9,11) is blocked. What about moving up? From (8,11), up to (7,11). Row 7, column 11 is * (from earlier analysis of row 7). So blocked. So from (8,11), need to find another way. Let's think. Maybe move left? From (8,11), left to (8,10), then down? Let's check.\n\nAt (8,10), moving down to row 9, column 10. Which is * (row 9, column 10). Blocked. How about moving further left? Let's go to (8,9). From there, down to row 9, column 9 is *, also blocked. Hmm. What about moving left to (8,8)? From there, can we move down? (8,8) is o. Down to (9,8). Let me check row 9, column 8: it's o. Yes. So from (8,8), move down to (9,8). Now at (9,8). Let's check row 9's data. At column 8: o. What's around here? Let's see. From (9,8), can move right? Column 9 is *, so no. Can move left? Column 7 is *, so no. Can move up? Back to (8,8). Or down to row 10, column 8. Let's check row 10's column 8. Row 10 is \"o*o*ooooo*ooo\". Parsing:\n\nRow 10: columns 0-12:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: o\n\n6: o\n\n7: o\n\n8: o\n\n9: o\n\n10: *\n\n11: o\n\n12: o\n\nSo column 8 of row 10 is o. So from (9,8), moving down to (10,8). Now at (10,8). Let's see. From here, can we move further? Let's check surrounding cells. From (10,8), can move right to (10,9) which is o, then to (10,10) which is *, so can't go there. Or move left? Let's see. Let's try moving right to (10,9). From there, down to row 11, column 9. Let's check row 11's data. Row 11 is \"o*o*****o*o**\". Let me parse:\n\nRow 11: columns 0-12:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: *\n\n5: *\n\n6: *\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: o\n\n11: *\n\n12: o\n\nSo column 9 of row 11 is *, so can't move down from (10,9). What about moving up? From (10,9), up to (9,9) which is * (row 9, column 9 is *). Not helpful. So perhaps from (10,8), move right to (10,9), then left? Not helpful. Alternatively, from (10,8), move down to (11,8). Let's check row 11, column 8: it's o. Yes. So from (10,8) down to (11,8). Now at (11,8). Let's look around. From here, can move right? Column 9 is * (row 11, column 9 is *). Can move left? Column 7 is * (row 11, column 7 is *). So can't move left or right. Can move up or down. Let's check down to row 12, column 8. Row 12 is \"o*ooo*ooooooX\". Let me parse row 12:\n\nRow 12: columns 0-12:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: o\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: o\n\n8: o\n\n9: o\n\n10: o\n\n11: o\n\n12: X\n\nSo column 8 of row 12 is o. So from (11,8), moving down to (12,8). Now at (12,8). From here, can we move towards the X at (12,12)? Let's see. From (12,8), need to move right through columns 9, 10, 11, 12. Let's check if they are open.\n\nRow 12, columns:\n\n8: o\n\n9: o\n\n10: o\n\n11: o\n\n12: X\n\nSo yes. From (12,8), move right four times to reach X. So this seems like a viable path.\n\nLet me recap the steps taken so far:\n\nStarting from (0,0):\n\ndown to (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0)\n\nright to (4,1), (4,2), ..., (4,8)\n\ndown to (5,8)\n\ndown to (6,8)\n\ndown to (7,8)\n\ndown to (8,8)\n\nright to (8,8) → (8,9), (8,10), (8,11) → but then backtracking to (8,8), down to (9,8)\n\ndown to (10,8)\n\ndown to (11,8)\n\ndown to (12,8)\n\nthen right to (12,9), (12,10), (12,11), (12,12).\n\nNow, converting these steps into the required move directions. Let's map each step:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): down\n\n(1,0) to (2,0): down\n\n(2,0) to (3,0): down\n\n(3,0) to (4,0): down\n\nThen from (4,0) to (4,1): right\n\n(4,1) to (4,2): right\n\n... up to (4,8): that's 8 rights (from column 0 to 8: 8 steps right).\n\nThen from (4,8) to (5,8): down\n\n(5,8) to (6,8): down\n\n(6,8) to (7,8): down\n\n(7,8) to (8,8): down\n\nFrom (8,8), moving right to (8,9): right\n\n(8,9) to (8,10): right\n\n(8,10) to (8,11): right\n\nBut then backtracking left to (8,8)? Wait no, earlier steps said from (8,11) back to (8,8)? Or did I take a different path?\n\nWait earlier, I said from (8,8) move right to (8,11). But then realized that moving down from (8,11) was blocked, so I backtracked to (8,8), then down to (9,8). So the steps from (8,8) are:\n\n(8,8) → right to (8,9), (8,10), (8,11) → then back left to (8,8)? No, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine that part.\n\nAt (8,8), I wanted to move right to reach (8,11), but then couldn't proceed further. So perhaps I should have moved down first. Let me correct that.\n\nFrom (8,8), moving down to (9,8). Then from there, down to (10,8), etc. So perhaps from (8,8), I don't need to move right. Let me adjust the steps.\n\nSo from (8,8), moving down to (9,8). So that step is down. Then from (9,8) down to (10,8): down. Then from (10,8) down to (11,8): down. Then from (11,8) down to (12,8): down. Then from (12,8) move right four times.\n\nSo the steps from (8,8) onward are:\n\ndown, down, down, down, then right, right, right, right.\n\nSo let's re-calculate the moves.\n\nNow, compiling all the moves:\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\ndown (to 1,0)\n\ndown (to 2,0)\n\ndown (to 3,0)\n\ndown (to 4,0)\n\nThen right 8 times (from column 0 to 8: 8 steps right)\n\nThen down (to 5,8)\n\ndown (to 6,8)\n\ndown (to 7,8)\n\ndown (to 8,8)\n\nThen down (to 9,8)\n\ndown (to 10,8)\n\ndown (to 11,8)\n\ndown (to 12,8)\n\nThen right 4 times (to 12,12).\n\nNow, let's count how many moves that is.\n\nThe moves would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nWait let me count:\n\nFirst four downs: 4.\n\nThen eight rights: 8.\n\nThen four downs (from 4,8 to 8,8? Wait no:\n\nFrom (4,8) down to (5,8): 1 down.\n\nThen down to (6,8): 2nd down.\n\nThen down to (7,8): 3rd down.\n\nThen down to (8,8): 4th down.\n\nThen from (8,8) down to (9,8): 5th down.\n\nThen down to (10,8): 6th.\n\nThen down to (11,8): 7th.\n\nThen down to (12,8): 8th down.\n\nThen four rights: 4.\n\nTotal moves: 4 + 8 + 4 + 4 = 20? Wait:\n\nFirst four downs: 4.\n\nThen eight rights: 8 → total 12.\n\nThen four downs (from 4,8 to 8,8): 4 → total 16.\n\nThen four more downs (from 8,8 to 12,8): 4 downs? Wait from (8,8) down to (9,8): 1, then to (10,8): 2, (11,8): 3, (12,8): 4. So that's four downs. So total downs after the initial four is 4+4=8 downs. So total moves:\n\n4 downs + 8 rights + 4 downs (from 4,8 to 8,8) + 4 downs (to 12,8) + 4 rights.\n\nWait that would be 4 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24? Let me recount:\n\nInitial four downs: 4.\n\nThen eight rights: +8 → 12.\n\nThen from (4,8) down to (5,8): 1 down → 13.\n\nThen down to (6,8): 14.\n\nDown to (7,8): 15.\n\nDown to (8,8): 16.\n\nThen from (8,8) down to (9,8): 17.\n\nDown to (10,8): 18.\n\nDown to (11,8): 19.\n\nDown to (12,8): 20.\n\nThen four rights: 21, 22, 23, 24.\n\nYes, 24 moves. But let's make sure that all these steps are valid and there are no walls in between.\n\nLet me verify some key points:\n\nFrom (4,8) down to (5,8): yes, row 5, column 8 is o.\n\nFrom (5,8) down to (6,8): yes, row 6, column 8 is o.\n\nFrom (6,8) down to (7,8): yes, row 7, column 8 is o.\n\nFrom (7,8) down to (8,8): yes, row 8, column 8 is o.\n\nFrom (8,8) down to (9,8): yes, row 9, column 8 is o.\n\nFrom (9,8) down to (10,8): yes, row 10, column 8 is o.\n\nFrom (10,8) down to (11,8): yes, row 11, column 8 is o.\n\nFrom (11,8) down to (12,8): yes, row 12, column 8 is o.\n\nThen from (12,8) right to (12,9), (12,10), (12,11), (12,12): yes, all o's except the last is X.\n\nSo this path is valid. Therefore, the sequence of moves would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nWait, let me count again the exact number of each move:\n\nFirst four downs: 4.\n\nThen eight rights: 8.\n\nThen from (4,8) down four times to (8,8): four downs.\n\nThen from (8,8) down four times to (12,8): four downs.\n\nThen four rights.\n\nSo total downs: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12? No, initial four downs (from row 0 to 4), then from (4,8) down to (5,8) (1), then to (6,8) (2), to (7,8) (3), to (8,8) (4). Then from (8,8) down four times to (12,8): that's 4 more downs. So total downs: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12? No, initial four, then four more (from 4,8 to 8,8), then four more (from 8,8 to 12,8). Total 4+4+4=12 downs. Then eight rights and four rights. Total moves: 12 downs, 12 rights? Let me recount:\n\nDowns:\n\n- 4 (initial)\n\n- 4 (from 4,8 to 8,8)\n\n- 4 (from 8,8 to 12,8)\n\nTotal downs: 12.\n\nRights:\n\n- 8 (from row 4, column 0 to 8)\n\n- 4 (from row 12, 8 to 12)\n\nTotal rights: 12.\n\nSo the list would be:\n\n['down'] x4 + ['right']x8 + ['down']x4 + ['down']x4 + ['right']x4.\n\nWait, no. The sequence is:\n\nFirst four downs, then eight rights, then four downs (from row 4 to row 8), then four downs (from row 8 to row 12), then four rights.\n\nSo the order is:\n\ndown x4 → right x8 → down x4 → down x4 → right x4.\n\nBut the four downs after the rights are actually 4 steps (from row 4,8 to 8,8) and then another four downs (from 8,8 to 12,8). So the move list would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nWait, no. Let me list each step:\n\nStart with four downs:\n\ndown, down, down, down.\n\nThen eight rights:\n\nright, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.\n\nThen from (4,8) down to (5,8): down.\n\nThen down to (6,8): down.\n\nThen down to (7,8): down.\n\nThen down to (8,8): down. → four downs.\n\nThen from (8,8) down to (9,8): down.\n\nThen down to (10,8): down.\n\nThen down to (11,8): down.\n\nThen down to (12,8): down. → four downs.\n\nThen four rights:\n\nright, right, right, right.\n\nSo total moves: 4 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 moves. The list would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nWait, but after the initial 4 downs and 8 rights, there are 4 downs (to reach row 8), then another 4 downs (to reach row 12). So that's 4 + 4 = 8 downs in total after the rights. So the total downs are 4 (initial) + 8 (later) = 12 downs. And rights are 8 + 4 = 12 rights. So the list is as above.\n\nBut let me check if this path is correct. For example, when moving down from (4,8) to (5,8), that's valid. And all the subsequent steps.\n\nYes, seems correct. Therefore, the answer would be this list of moves.\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path. For example, maybe there's a way to avoid some of the long right/down sequences. But given the maze structure, perhaps this is the only viable path. Alternatively, maybe there's another route.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this path. Now, converting this into the required format: the list of moves as strings.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nBut let me count again to ensure the number of moves:\n\nInitial 4 downs: 4.\n\nThen 8 rights: 8 → total 12.\n\nThen 4 downs (from row 4 to 8): 4 → total 16.\n\nThen 4 downs (from row 8 to 12): 4 → total 20.\n\nThen 4 rights: total 24.\n\nYes. So the list has 24 elements.\n\nBut let me verify the exact steps once more.\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\nAfter 4 downs, we are at (4,0).\n\nThen 8 rights to (4,8).\n\nThen 4 downs to (8,8).\n\nThen 4 downs to (12,8).\n\nThen 4 rights to (12,12).\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be this list.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this 5x5 maze. The maze is given as rows of characters. Let me first visualize the maze properly.\n\nThe maze is:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o\nRow 1: o * o * *\nRow 2: o * o o o\nRow 3: o * o * o\nRow 4: o * o * X\n\nSo each row is a string. Let me convert this into a grid for better understanding. Let's index rows and columns from 0 to 4.\n\nStarting point 'I' is at (0,0). The destination 'X' is at (4,4).\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (4,4), moving only through 'o's (or the start and end points). The allowed moves are up, down, left, right. But since we're in a grid, need to check boundaries and if the next cell is passable.\n\nLet me think about possible paths. Since it's a maze, maybe BFS would be a good approach here, but since I'm doing it manually, I need to trace step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's see possible first moves. From (0,0), can move right (to (0,1)) or down (to (1,0)).\n\nLet me try exploring possible paths.\n\nFirst, check down to (1,0). Let me see what's there. Row 1, column 0 is 'o', which is passable. Then from (1,0), possible moves: up (back to start?), down (to (2,0)), or right (to (1,1) which is '*'), so that's a wall. So from (1,0), moving down to (2,0). But row 2, column 0 is 'o', so allowed. Then from (2,0), possible moves: up (back to (1,0)), down (to (3,0) which is 'o'), or right to (2,1) which is '*' (wall). So moving down to (3,0). From (3,0), again can go up, down, or right. Down to (4,0) which is 'o'. From (4,0), can move up, right, etc. But column 0, row 4 is 'o'. Now, from here, moving right would hit (4,1) which is '*', so blocked. So from (4,0), can only move up or maybe right? No. So maybe need to go back up?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better path. Let me backtrack. Starting from (0,0) going right. Let's try that.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Move right to (0,1). Then from (0,1), possible moves: left (back), down (to (1,1) which is * blocked), or right again to (0,2). So moving right to (0,2)? Wait, but (0,1) is adjacent to (0,2). Let me check what's in row 0. The first row is I o o o o. So all positions after (0,0) are 'o's. Wait, no. Wait the first row is Ioooo, which would be (0,0) is I, then (0,1) to (0,4) are o's. So from (0,1), moving down to row 1, column 1 is *, which is blocked. So maybe from (0,1), moving right to (0,2). Then perhaps moving down?\n\nLet me try that. So path so far is right. Let's think step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's try moving right to (0,1). Then from there, can we move down? (1,1) is *, so no. So maybe move right again to (0,2). Now at (0,2). From here, down to (1,2) which is 'o' (row 1, column 2 is 'o'? Let me check row 1: o*o**. So row 1 is positions 0 to 4: 0 is o, 1 is *, 2 is o, 3 is *, 4 is *. So yes, (1,2) is o. So moving down from (0,2) to (1,2). Now at (1,2). From here, possible moves: up (back to (0,2)), down to (2,2) which is o (row 2 is o*ooo: column 2 is o), left to (1,1) which is blocked, or right to (1,3) which is *.\n\nSo moving down to (2,2). Now at (2,2). From here, possible moves: up (to 1,2), down to (3,2) which is o (row 3 is o*o*o: column 2 is o), left to (2,1) which is * (row 2 is o*ooo, column 1 is *), or right to (2,3) which is o. Let me see. So from (2,2), moving down to (3,2). Now at (3,2). From here, row 3, column 2 is o. Possible moves: up (back), down to (4,2) which is o (row 4: o*o*X. So row 4, column 0 is o, 1 is *, 2 is o, 3 is *, 4 is X). So (4,2) is o. Moving down there. Now at (4,2). From here, can move up, left, right. Let's see. To reach X at (4,4), need to get there. But from (4,2), moving right would hit (4,3) which is *, blocked. So can't. So maybe move up from (4,2) to (3,2). But already visited. Hmm. So stuck here? Or perhaps there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, when at (3,2), instead of moving down to (4,2), maybe move right to (3,3)? But (3,3) is * (row 3: ...*o). So no. Or left? From (3,2), left to (3,1) which is * (row 3 is o*o*o: column 1 is *). So no. So moving down to (4,2) seems the only option, but then stuck. So perhaps this path is a dead end. Let me backtrack.\n\nBack to (2,2). Maybe instead of moving down to (3,2), move right to (2,3). From (2,2) move right to (2,3) which is o. Now at (2,3). From here, can move left, down, or right. Let's move down to (3,3). But (3,3) is * (row 3's column 3 is *). So blocked. So can't. So maybe move right to (2,4). Which is o (row 2 is o*ooo: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o). So (2,4) is o. From (2,3) move right to (2,4). Now at (2,4). From here, possible moves: up (to row 1, column 4 which is *), down to (3,4) which is o (row 3, column 4 is o?), let me check row 3: o*o*o. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o. Yes. So (3,4) is o. So moving down to (3,4). Now at (3,4). From here, can move up (back), down to (4,4) which is X! So that's the destination. So the path would be:\n\nStart (0,0) → right (0,1) → right (0,2) → down (1,2) → down (2,2) → right (2,3) → right (2,4) → down (3,4) → down (4,4). \n\nLet me check each step for validity:\n\n(0,0) to (0,1): right. Valid.\n\n(0,1) to (0,2): right. Valid.\n\n(0,2) down to (1,2): down.\n\n(1,2) down to (2,2): down.\n\n(2,2) right to (2,3): right.\n\n(2,3) right to (2,4): right.\n\n(2,4) down to (3,4): down.\n\n(3,4) down to (4,4): down. \n\nYes, that works. Let me check the cells:\n\n(3,4) is o, and (4,4) is X. So that's valid. So the moves would be:\n\nright, right, down, down, right, right, down, down.\n\nBut let me check if there's any shorter path. Alternatively, maybe another route.\n\nAnother possible path: starting with down to (1,0), then down to (2,0), then right? Let's see:\n\n(0,0) down to (1,0). Then down to (2,0). From (2,0), can move right? (2,1) is *, blocked. So can't. So up back? No. So maybe down to (3,0). Then down to (4,0). From (4,0), can move right? But (4,1) is *, so blocked. So stuck. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: starting from (0,0), move right to (0,1), then down to (1,1) is blocked. No. So maybe from (0,0) move right to (0,1), then down to (1,2)? Wait, how? From (0,1), moving down would be to (1,1), which is *.\n\nNo. So that path is invalid. So the earlier path seems valid.\n\nAnother possible path: starting at (0,0), move down to (1,0), then right to (1,1) is blocked. No. So down again to (2,0). From (2,0), can move right to (2,1) is * blocked. So no. So up to (1,0). Then perhaps right? But (1,0) can move right to (1,1) which is blocked. So no. So maybe this path isn't working.\n\nSo the first path I found seems valid. Let me check again the steps:\n\nMoves: right, right, down, down, right, right, down, down. Let's count the steps. From start to (0,2) is two rights. Then down to (1,2) (one down), then down to (2,2) (second down). Then three rights: from (2,2) to (2,4) (two rights?), wait:\n\nFrom (2,2) to (2,3): right.\n\nThen from (2,3) to (2,4): right. So two rights. Then down to (3,4) (one down?), but how?\n\nWait, from (2,4), moving down would be to (3,4). Then from (3,4) down to (4,4). So two downs. So total moves:\n\nright, right, down, down, right, right, down, down. That's 8 moves. Let me check the coordinates:\n\nStart (0,0)\n\n1. right → (0,1)\n2. right → (0,2)\n3. down → (1,2)\n4. down → (2,2)\n5. right → (2,3)\n6. right → (2,4)\n7. down → (3,4)\n8. down → (4,4)\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer would be the list of moves: ['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down'].\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another path that's shorter. For example, maybe going up or left somewhere. Let me think again.\n\nAnother possible path: Starting from (0,0) go all the way right to (0,4), but then can't go down because row 1, column 4 is *.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,0) move down to (1,0), then down to (2,0), then right to (2,2)? Let's see:\n\n(0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0). From (2,0), can move right to (2,1) which is *, blocked. No. So can't. So maybe up to (1,0) again. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: from (0,0) move down to (1,0), then right to (1,2) (but how? From (1,0), moving right to (1,1) is blocked. So can't. So no.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,0) move right to (0,2), then down to (1,2), then right to (1,3) is blocked. No. So that's not helpful.\n\nSo the initial path seems the only valid one. Let me confirm once again each step's cell content.\n\n(0,0) is I.\n\n(0,1) is o.\n\n(0,2) is o.\n\n(1,2) is o.\n\n(2,2) is o.\n\n(2,3) is o.\n\n(2,4) is o.\n\n(3,4) is o.\n\n(4,4) is X.\n\nYes, all passable. So the moves are correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the list of moves as described.\n ;Answer: ['right','right','down','down','right','right','down','down']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this 5x5 maze. Let me first visualize the maze based on the given input.\n\nThe maze is:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o\nRow 1: o * o * *\nRow 2: o * o o o\nRow 3: * * o * *\nRow 4: o o o o X\n\nSo the starting point is at position (0,0). The destination is at (4,4). Let me note down the coordinates of walls and open spaces.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the possible moves. The allowed directions are up, down, left, right. But since we start at (0,0), moving up isn't possible. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe a BFS (Breadth-First Search) would be the best way to find the shortest path. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll need to trace a valid path step by step.\n\nLet me start by locating the start. From (0,0), possible moves are down or right. Let's check each possibility.\n\nFirst, let's try moving right to (0,1). But looking at row 0, all are 'o's except the start. Wait, the first row is I (which is start) followed by o's. So (0,0) is start. From there, moving right to (0,1) is allowed. But maybe moving down first is better? Let's see.\n\nOption 1: Move down to (1,0). Row 1, column 0 is 'o' (open). So that's valid. From there, can I move down again to (2,0)? Row 2, column 0 is 'o' again. Yes. Then from (2,0), maybe move right? Let's see. Row 2, column 1 is '*', which is a wall. So can't move right. So options are up, down, or right (but right is blocked). From (2,0), moving down to (3,0). But row 3, column 0 is '*' (wall), so that's blocked. Moving up would take me back to (1,0). So maybe from (2,0), moving right isn't possible. Hmm.\n\nAlternative path. From (0,0), moving right to (0,1). Then maybe down? Let's see. From (0,1), moving down to (1,1) which is a '*' (wall). Not allowed. So maybe moving right again to (0,2). Then down? From (0,2), moving down to (1,2). Let's check row 1, column 2: it's 'o' (open). So that's valid. Now at (1,2). From here, possible moves: up (back to (0,2)), down to (2,2), left to (1,1) which is a wall. So moving down to (2,2). Row 2, column 2 is 'o'. Then from there, maybe move right to (2,3). Row 2, column 3 is 'o'. Then from (2,3), can move down? Row 3, column 3 is '*' (wall). Or move right to (2,4). Which is 'o'. From (2,4), can we move down? Row 3, column 4 is '*' (since row 3 is **o**, wait original input for row 3 is **o**. Let me recheck the maze.\n\nOriginal Maze Board:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o → positions (0,0) to (0,4) are I, o, o, o, o\nRow 1: o * o * * → (1,0)=o, (1,1)=*, (1,2)=o, (1,3)=*, (1,4)=*\nRow 2: o * o o o → (2,0)=o, (2,1)=*, (2,2)=o, (2,3)=o, (2,4)=o\nRow 3: * * o * * → (3,0)=*, (3,1)=*, (3,2)=o, (3,3)=*, (3,4)=*\nRow 4: o o o o X → (4,0)=o, (4,1)=o, (4,2)=o, (4,3)=o, (4,4)=X\n\nSo from (2,4), which is row 2, column 4, moving down to row 3, column 4 is *, which is blocked. So can't go down. From (2,4), can we move left? Let's see. Moving left from (2,4) takes us to (2,3), which is o. But we just came from (2,3)? Wait, earlier steps: from (2,2) → right to (2,3) → right to (2,4). So if we are at (2,4), moving left would take us back. Maybe need to find another direction. From (2,4), moving down is blocked. Moving right is beyond the maze. So maybe move up? Up to row 1, column 4. But row 1, column 4 is * (from row 1's o * o * * → columns 0,1,2,3,4. So column 4 is *). So can't move up. So stuck here? So perhaps this path is a dead end. Let me backtrack.\n\nSo from (2,3), maybe instead of moving right to (2,4), we can try moving down? (2,3) is row 2, column 3. Moving down to row 3, column 3 is *, blocked. So no. Moving left to (2,2)? Which is where we came from. Not helpful. So perhaps from (1,2), instead of moving down to (2,2), we can move in another direction?\n\nAt (1,2), possible directions: up (to (0,2)), down (to (2,2)), left (to (1,1) which is blocked). So if we go up to (0,2), then maybe from there, can we move further? From (0,2), possible moves: down (back to (1,2)), left to (0,1), right to (0,3), or up? No, since row 0 is top. Let's say from (0,2) move right to (0,3). Then from (0,3), can move down? Let's check. (0,3) is row 0, column 3. Moving down to (1,3) which is * (blocked). Or move right to (0,4). From (0,4), moving down to (1,4) is blocked. So again stuck. Hmm. So maybe this path isn't working.\n\nLet me try another approach. Starting from (0,0). Let's try moving down to (1,0). Then from (1,0), can I move down again to (2,0)? Yes. From (2,0), can I move right? Column 1 is *, so no. So move down to (3,0) which is blocked. So can't. So from (2,0), move up back to (1,0). Not helpful. Alternatively, from (1,0), move right? Let's see. From (1,0), moving right to (1,1) is blocked. So no. So from (1,0), can move left back? No. Or down. So maybe from (2,0), move up and then left? No, since (2,0) is column 0, can't move left. Hmm. Dead end here. So maybe the initial approach of moving right first was better.\n\nLet me try again. Starting at (0,0). Move right to (0,1). Then right again to (0,2). Then down to (1,2). Then down to (2,2). From there, maybe move left to (2,1) is blocked. So can't. So move right to (2,3). Then down is blocked. From (2,3), move left? No. So maybe from (2,3), move up? To (1,3), which is * (blocked). So no. Or move right to (2,4). From there, maybe move up to (1,4) which is blocked. So again stuck. Hmm.\n\nAlternative path: From (0,0) move down to (1,0), then right? (1,0) can move right to (1,1)? No, it's a wall. So no. So perhaps from (1,0) move down to (2,0). Then from (2,0), move right to (2,1) is blocked. So no. So stuck again.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. Let me check the entire maze again. The destination is at (4,4). Let me see if there's a way to reach there from the bottom.\n\nLooking at row 4: o o o o X. So from row 4, columns 0-3 are open. So maybe there's a way to reach row 4 from the left or up.\n\nLooking at row 3: **o**. So (3,2) is open. So if I can get to (3,2), maybe move down to (4,2). Then from (4,2), move right to (4,3), then right to (4,4). So how to reach (3,2)?\n\nLooking at row 2: o * o o o. So (2,0) is open. (2,2) is open. From (2,2), moving down to (3,2) is possible. So if I can reach (2,2), then down to (3,2), then down to (4,2), then right to (4,3) and (4,4). How to reach (2,2)?\n\nEarlier steps tried that. Let me think. Starting from (0,0), moving down to (1,0), down to (2,0). From (2,0), can I move right to (2,1)? No, it's a wall. So from (2,0), move up back to (1,0)? Not helpful. Or from (2,0), move down to (3,0) which is blocked. So no. So how to get from (2,0) to (2,2)? Maybe need to go around.\n\nAlternative path: From (0,0) → right to (0,1) → down to (1,1) is blocked. No. From (0,1) → right to (0,2). Then down to (1,2). From (1,2), down to (2,2). Yes! Then from (2,2) down to (3,2). Then down to (4,2). Then right to (4,3) and (4,4). That seems possible. Let me check each step.\n\nLet me outline this path:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nMove right to (0,1): move 'right'\n\nMove right to (0,2): 'right'\n\nMove down to (1,2): 'down'\n\nMove down to (2,2): 'down'\n\nMove down to (3,2): 'down'\n\nMove down to (4,2): 'down'\n\nThen move right to (4,3): 'right'\n\nThen move right to (4,4): 'right'\n\nBut wait, from (3,2), moving down to (4,2) is allowed. Then from (4,2), moving right twice. That would work. Let me check if there are any walls along this path.\n\nYes, all those positions are open. Let me check each step:\n\n(0,0) → (0,1): valid.\n\n(0,1) → (0,2): valid.\n\n(0,2) → (1,2): row 1, column 2 is 'o' → valid.\n\n(1,2) → (2,2): row 2, column 2 is 'o' → valid.\n\n(2,2) → (3,2): row 3, column 2 is 'o' → valid.\n\n(3,2) → (4,2): valid.\n\n(4,2) → (4,3): valid.\n\n(4,3) → (4,4): valid. Yes! So this path works.\n\nSo the moves would be: right, right, down, down, down, down, right, right.\n\nBut let me count the steps. Starting from the initial position:\n\nEach move is as follows:\n\nStart.\n\n1. right → (0,1)\n\n2. right → (0,2)\n\n3. down → (1,2)\n\n4. down → (2,2)\n\n5. down → (3,2)\n\n6. down → (4,2)\n\n7. right → (4,3)\n\n8. right → (4,4)\n\nSo the list of moves is ['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right'].\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path. For example, maybe going left or up somewhere else. But given the maze structure, perhaps this is the only way.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to go from (0,0) down to (1,0), then right to (1,2)? Let me see. From (1,0), moving right to (1,1) is blocked. So no. So the previous path seems valid.\n\nAnother possible path: from (0,0) move right, down, right, down... Let me think. For example, maybe a different route.\n\nBut perhaps the path I found is correct. Let me make sure there are no walls in between. Yes, all steps are through 'o's.\n\nSo the answer should be the list of moves as described. Let me check the number of steps again. From start to end, 8 moves. Let me count again:\n\nRight (1), right (2), down (3), down (4), down (5), down (6), right (7), right (8). Yes.\n\nBut wait, when moving from (3,2) to (4,2), that's one 'down' move. So step 6 is moving from (3,2) to (4,2). Then step 7 and 8 are rights. So total of 8 moves.\n\nSo the answer is ['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right'].\n\nBut let me check if there's another possible path. For example, maybe going up at some point. But since the start is at the top row, there's no up from there. So probably this is the correct path.\n ;Answer: ['right','right','down','down','down','down','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start 'I' to the destination 'X' in this maze. The maze is 10x10, right? Let me first try to visualize the maze. Let me write it down or at least map it mentally.\n\nThe first row is Ioo*ooooooo. So the starting point is at position (0,0) assuming rows and columns start at 0. The X is at the end of the last row, which is row 9. Let me check the last row: ooo*ooooooX. So the X is at position (9, 9), probably. Let me confirm each row.\n\nBut maybe I should represent the maze as a grid. Let me think. Each cell can be checked for whether it's passable. The available moves are up, down, left, right. So I need to find a path from start to end, avoiding the * walls.\n\nSince the user wants a list of moves, I need to figure out the sequence of directions to take. This sounds like a pathfinding problem. The standard approach would be BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the shortest path, or maybe DFS. But since the user just wants any valid path, perhaps BFS is better to ensure it's the shortest and avoid getting stuck in loops.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, I need to simulate the process. Let me start by locating the start and end points.\n\nStart is 'I' in the first row. Let's look at the first row: Ioo*ooooooo. So first character is I, then o, o, then *, then o's. So the starting position is (0,0). The first row is row 0, columns 0-9.\n\nNow, the end is X in the last row. The last row is ooo*ooooooX. Let me check the 10th row (index 9). Let's count the columns. The X is at column 9? Let's see: the row is ooo*ooooooX. Let's count the characters. Let's see, each row has 10 characters? Let me check the first line: Ioo*ooooooo. Let's count:\n\nI o o * o o o o o o → that's 10 characters. So each row is 10 characters. The last row is ooo*ooooooX. Let's count: o o o * o o o o o X. Yes, column 9 is X.\n\nSo the destination is (9,9).\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (9,9), moving through 'o's and avoiding '*'.\n\nLet me try to sketch the maze step by step.\n\nRow 0: I (0,0), then o at (0,1), (0,2), then * at (0,3). Then o's from (0,4) to (0,9).\n\nRow 1: **o*o***o*o → columns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: o, 8: *, 9: o.\n\nRow 2: ooooooo*o*o → columns 0-6 are o's, then * at 7, o at 8, * at 9?\n\nWait, let me parse each row again carefully.\n\nLet me write down each row as a list of cells:\n\nRow 0: ['I', 'o', 'o', '*', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o']\n\nRow 1: ['*', '*', 'o', '*', 'o', '*', '*', '*', 'o', '*']\n\nRow 2: ['o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', '*', '*']? Wait original is \"ooooooo*o*o\". Let me count:\n\nRow 2: ooooooo*o*o → first seven o's? Let's count: o o o o o o o * o * o? Wait, original input for row 2 is \"ooooooo*o*o\". Let me count each character:\n\nRow 2: o o o o o o o * o * o → that's 11 characters? No, original is n=10. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The user provided the maze as:\n\nMaze Board:\nIoo*ooooooo\n**o*o***o*o\nooooooo*o*o\no*o*o***o**\no*o*ooo*ooo\no*******o*o\nooo*o*ooo*o\no***o***o*o\nooooooo*o*o\no*********o\nooo*ooooooX\n\nEach line is a row. Let me check the length of each line. For example, first line: \"Ioo*ooooooo\" → length is 1 + 2 + 1 + 7 → total 1+2 is 3, plus 7 is 10? Let me count:\n\nI (1), o (2), *, then ooooooo (7?), but total 1+2+1+7= 11? Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me count each character in the first line:\n\nI, o, o, *, o, o, o, o, o, o → 10 characters. Yes. So row 0 is 10 characters. Let me process each row correctly.\n\nRow 0: [I, o, o, *, o, o, o, o, o, o]\n\nRow 1: **o*o***o*o → let's parse each position:\n\nColumns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o, 9: * ?\n\nWait original string is \"**o*o***o*o\".

Let me count:\n\n1. *\n2. *\n3. o\n4. *\n5. o\n6. *\n7. *\n8. *\n9. o\n10. * → Oh, but that's 10 characters. So row 1 is 10 elements. So columns 0-9.\n\nRow 1: [*, *, o, *, o, *, *, *, o, *]\n\nRow 2: \"ooooooo*o*o\" → let's count:\n\no o o o o o o * o * o → but that's 11? Wait no. Let me check:\n\nOriginal is \"ooooooo*o*o\". Let's count each character:\n\no (1), o (2), o (3), o (4), o (5), o (6), o (7), * (8), o (9), * (10), o (11)? No, but the row must be 10 characters. So perhaps I made a mistake in splitting. Let me check again:\n\nThe string is \"ooooooo*o*o\". Let's split into individual characters:\n\nAssuming it's 10 characters:\n\nPositions 0-9:\n\n0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: * ?\n\nBut then the string would be ooooooo*o* → but the original is \"ooooooo*o*o\". Wait, perhaps the last part is *o. Let me think again. Let me write it as:\n\nOriginal row 2: ooooooo*o*o. Let me count:\n\nIf there are 7 o's, then *, then o, *, o. That would be 7+1+1+1= 10? 7+3= 10. So positions 0-6: o's, 7: *, 8: o, 9: * ?\n\nBut then the original string is ooooooo*o*o. Let me check the letters:\n\nYes, positions 0-6 are o's (7 o's), then *, then o, *, o. Wait that's 7 + 3 = 10. So row 2 is:\n\n[ o, o, o, o, o, o, o, *, o, * ] ?\n\nBut then the original string ends with 'o*o'? Wait, no. Let me check again. If the row is \"ooooooo*o*o\", then the 10th character (assuming 10 characters) would be the last 'o'? Let me split it:\n\nLet me write the string as:\n\nIndices 0-9:\n\n0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: * ?\n\nBut the string is \"ooooooo*o*o\". Let me check:\n\nBetween the 7th * and the end: the remaining characters are \"o*o\". So positions 7 is *, 8 is o, 9 is *? But the original ends with 'o'? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Maybe the string is \"ooooooo*o*o\", which is 10 characters. Let me count:\n\nLet me count the number of characters in the string:\n\n\"ooooooo*o*o\" → Let's count each character:\n\n1. o\n2. o\n3. o\n4. o\n5. o\n6. o\n7. o\n8. *\n9. o\n10. *\n11. o → Oh no, that's 11 characters. But that can't be. There must be a mistake. Wait, maybe the original input is different. Let me check again. The user provided:\n\nRow 2: ooooooo*o*o → perhaps there's a typo? Or maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal line: \"ooooooo*o*o\". Let's count the letters:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\no o o o o o o * o * o → that's 11 letters. But the maze is n x n, so each row must be same length. The first line is 10 characters. So maybe there's a typo in my thinking. Alternatively, perhaps the correct parsing for row 2 is that there are 7 o's, then *, o, *, o. But that's 7+3=10? No, 7 + 3 is 10? 7 o's, then 3 more characters ( *, o, * o? No, that's 3 or 4? Maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct parsing is that row 2 is \"ooooooo*o*o\", which is 10 characters. Let me count:\n\nLet me split into letters:\n\nAssuming the string is:\n\no o o o o o o * o * o → but that's 11 letters. So perhaps there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the correct string is \"oooooo*o*o\", which would be 10 letters. Let me check again.\n\nBut given that the user provided it as part of the maze, perhaps I need to re-express each row properly. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that each row is 10 characters. Let me check the last row: \"ooo*ooooooX\". Let's count:\n\no o o * o o o o o X → 10 characters? Yes: 3 o's, *, then 6 o's, then X. 3+1+6+1= 11? No. Wait 3 o's, *, then oooooo (6 o's?), then X. That's 3+1+6+1= 11. But that's impossible. Wait, perhaps the last row is \"ooo*ooooooX\", which is 10 characters. Let me count:\n\nLet me think of it as ooo* followed by 6 o's and X? No. Let me split it:\n\nOriginal: \"ooo*ooooooX\"\n\nBreaking into individual characters:\n\no, o, o, *, o, o, o, o, o, o, X → that's 11 characters. But that's impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the last row is \"ooo*oooooX\", making it 10 characters. But the user wrote \"ooo*ooooooX\". Maybe there's a typo. However, since this is a problem given by the user, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that each row is 10 characters. Maybe I made a mistake in parsing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, but I have to work with what's given. Let me try to proceed.\n\nLet me try to parse each row as 10 characters. Let's take row 0 as 10, row 1 as 10, etc.\n\nLet me proceed with the first row: Ioo*ooooooo → 10 characters. Let's take that as correct.\n\nRow 2: \"ooooooo*o*o\" → perhaps there's a typo and it's supposed to be \"oooooo*o*o\", making 10 characters. Let's assume that. So 6 o's, then *, o, *, o? Let me count: 6 o's (positions 0-5), then * (6), o (7), * (8), o (9)? Wait, that would be positions 0-9. Let me check:\n\no o o o o o * o * o → that's 10 characters. Yes. So row 2 is [o, o, o, o, o, o, *, o, *, o]. So columns 6 is *, 7 is o, 8 is *, 9 is o.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed step by step, trying to find a path manually.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's look for possible moves. From (0,0), possible directions are down (to row 1, column 0) or right (to (0,1)).\n\nBut row 1, column 0 is a '*' (wall), so can't go down. So the only initial move is right. Let's check:\n\nAt (0,0), can move right to (0,1). Then from there, can we go further right? Let's see:\n\n(0,0) → right to (0,1). Then right to (0,2). Then at (0,3) is a *, so can't go there. So from (0,2), can't go right. So possible directions are down, left, or right (but right is blocked).\n\nLet me try to map this out. Let's think of the path step by step.\n\nStart at (0,0). Let's move right to (0,1). Then right again to (0,2). Now, from (0,2), can we go down? Let's check row 1, column 2. Row 1's column 2 is 'o' (from earlier parsing of row 1: **o*...). Yes, row 1, column 2 is 'o', so we can move down to (1,2).\n\nSo path so far: right, right, down. Directions would be ['right', 'right', 'down'].\n\nNow at (1,2). Let's see possible moves. From here, can we go up (back to (0,2)), left (to (1,1) which is '*'), right to (1,3) which is '*', or down to (2,2) which is 'o' (assuming row 2, column 2 is o). So best to go down. So move down to (2,2). Add 'down' to the path.\n\nNow at (2,2). Let's check surroundings. From here, possible directions:\n\nUp: (1,2) – already visited? Or can go back? But we need to avoid cycles. Let's think. From (2,2), what's the path. Let's look around. The current cell is (row, column). Let's check the cells:\n\nLooking at row 2. Earlier, assuming row 2 is [o, o, o, o, o, o, *, o, *, o]. So column 2 is o. Let me check possible moves:\n\nFrom (2,2), can we move in any direction? Let's check:\n\nLeft: (2,1) is o, so can go left. Right: (2,3) is o. Down: (3,2). What's there? Row 3 is \"o*o*o***o**\". Let me parse row 3: o * o * o * * * o * * ?\n\nAssuming row 3 is: o * o * o *** o * * ?\n\nLet me parse the third row (row index 3): \"o*o*o***o**\".\n\nBreaking into individual characters:\n\n0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o, 9: * ?\n\nWait, original string: \"o*o*o***o**\". Let's count:\n\no * o * o * * * o * * → that's 11 characters. Again, this suggests a possible error. But assuming it's 10 characters, perhaps it's o*o*o***o* → but the user wrote \"o***o**\". Let me try again. Let me think of row 3 as \"o*o*o***o**\" which is 10 characters. Let me split:\n\nPositions 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o, 9: * → that's 10 characters. Yes. So row 3, column 2 is o. So from (2,2), down to row 3, column 2 is o. So can move down. So possible directions: up (to 1,2?), left (to 2,1), right (to 2,3?), down (to 3,2).\n\nSo perhaps from (2,2), moving down to (3,2). Let's do that. Add 'down' to path.\n\nNow at (3,2). Let's check what's around here. From here, possible directions:\n\nUp: (2,2) – already visited.\n\nLeft: column 1 is *, can't go.\n\nRight: column 3 is *, can't go.\n\nDown: row 4, column 2. Let's check row 4. Original row 4: \"o*o*ooo*ooo\". Let me parse it as o * o * o o o * o o o ?\n\nAssuming row 4 is: [o, *, o, *, o, o, o, *, o, o, o] but that's 11 characters. Again, perhaps there's a mistake. Let me try again. Original row 4: \"o*o*ooo*ooo\". Let's split into 10 characters:\n\no * o * o o o * o o o → no, that's too long. Let me count:\n\nOriginal string: o * o * o o o * o o o → 11 characters. So perhaps there's a typo. But assuming it's correct, perhaps I need to find another way. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that each row is 10 characters. Let me try again for row 4.\n\nOriginal row 4: \"o*o*ooo*ooo\". Let's split into 10 characters:\n\nAssume that it's o * o * o o o * o o → that's 10. Let me check:\n\no (0), * (1), o (2), * (3), o (4), o (5), o (6), * (7), o (8), o (9). So yes. So row 4, column 2 is o. So from (3,2) down to (4,2). So can move down. Let's add 'down' to the path.\n\nNow at (4,2). Let's check surroundings. From here, possible directions:\n\nUp: (3,2) already visited.\n\nLeft: column 1 is * (from row 4's structure: [o, *, ...], so column 1 is *.\n\nRight: column 3 is * (since row 4 has * at column 3). So can't go left or right. Down to row 5, column 2. Let's check row 5.\n\nRow 5: \"o*******o*o\". Let me parse this as o followed by seven *s, then o, *, o. Assuming 10 characters:\n\nRow 5: [o, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, o, * ]? No, original is \"o*******o*o\". Let me count:\n\no followed by seven *? Let's see:\n\nOriginal: o ******* o * o → but that's o + 7 * + 3 characters. Total 1+7+3= 11. Again, assuming it's 10 characters. Let me think of it as o followed by seven *s and then o*o. That's o followed by seven *s (positions 1-7), then o (8), * (9), o (10)? No. Maybe the correct parsing is o followed by seven *s and then o*o? But that's too long. Alternatively, maybe it's o followed by 7 *s and then o* → making 1+7+2=10. So row 5 would be o, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, o, *? No, that's 10 characters? Let me count:\n\no (1), then seven *s (positions 1-7?), then o and * → total 1+7+2=10? So row 5 is [o, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, o, *] → no, that's 11. I'm confused. Perhaps there's a mistake in the user's input. But since I need to proceed, perhaps I should assume that row 5, column 2 is a *? Because the row starts with o followed by several *s. For example, if row 5 is o followed by several *s, then maybe column 2 is *.\n\nIf that's the case, then from (4,2), moving down to row 5, column 2 is a wall. So can't go down. So from (4,2), what other options are there? Let's check left and right again. Left is column 1 (wall), right is column 3 (wall). So stuck? That suggests that the path I'm taking is wrong. Maybe I need to backtrack.\n\nSo perhaps from (3,2), instead of moving down, I should go in another direction. Let me retrace.\n\nAt (3,2), possible directions are up (to 2,2), left (blocked), right (blocked), down (to 4,2 which may be blocked). So maybe I need to go up or find another way. Wait, from (3,2), can I go left or right? No. So maybe from (2,2), instead of going down to (3,2), I should go right or left?\n\nLet me go back to (2,2). From there, possible directions are up (to 1,2), left (to 2,1), right (to 2,3), down (to 3,2). Earlier I tried down, which led to a dead end. Let's try another direction.\n\nLet me try moving right from (2,2) to (2,3). Assuming row 2, column 3 is o (since earlier parsing for row 2 was up to column 7 as *). Wait earlier I thought row 2 was [o, o, o, o, o, o, o, *, o, *]. So column 3 is o. So moving right to (2,3). Let's do that. So path is now: right, right, down, right.\n\nNow at (2,3). Let's check possible directions. From here:\n\nUp: row 1, column 3 is * (from row 1's structure: **o*... → row 1, column 3 is *). Can't go up.\n\nLeft: (2,2), already visited.\n\nRight: (2,4) is o (assuming row 2's columns up to 6 are o's. So can move right. Let's go right again. Add 'right' to path.\n\nNow at (2,4). Continue right? Let's see. (2,5) is o. Right again. Now at (2,5). Then right to (2,6), which is o? Wait row 2's column 7 is *? Earlier parsing said row 2 is up to column 6 as o, then * at 7. So (2,6) is o? Or is it *? Let me recheck.\n\nIf row 2 is \"ooooooo*o*o\", assuming it's 10 characters, perhaps the structure is:\n\nColumns 0-6: o's (7 o's?), then column 7: *, column 8: o, column 9: *.\n\nSo at (2,6) is *, so can't move there. So from (2,5), moving right to (2,6) is blocked. So from (2,5), can we go down? Let's check row 3, column 5. Row 3's column 5?\n\nRow 3 is \"o*o*o***o**\". Assuming earlier parsing, row 3's columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *.\n\nSo column 5 is *, so can't go down. What about up? From (2,5), up to row 1, column 5. Row 1's column 5 is * (from earlier parsing of row 1: **o*o***o*o → columns 0:*, 1:*, 2:o, 3:*, 4:o, 5:*, etc. Yes. So can't go up. Left? Back to (2,4). So maybe from (2,5), need to go down? But row 3, column 5 is *.\n\nHmm, stuck again. Maybe need to backtrack again. Let me retrace.\n\nFrom (2,3), moving right to (2,4), then right to (2,5). Now stuck. So perhaps from (2,3), instead of moving right, try down. From (2,3), can we go down to row 3, column 3? Let's check row 3, column 3. Earlier parsing said row 3, column 3 is *. So can't go there. What about left? No, already came from left. Up? No. So stuck again. So perhaps from (2,2), instead of going right, try going left?\n\nFrom (2,2), moving left to (2,1), which is o? Earlier parsing of row 2: columns 0-6 are o's. So column 1 is o. So yes. So path would be from (2,2) left to (2,1). Add 'left' to path.\n\nNow at (2,1). From here, possible directions:\n\nRight: back to (2,2).\n\nUp: row 1, column 1 is *, can't go.\n\nDown: row 3, column 1. Let's check row 3's column 1. Row 3 is \"o*o*...\" → column 1 is *. Can't go down. Left: (2,0) which is o? Row 2, column 0 is o. So can move left. Let's do that. Add 'left' to path.\n\nNow at (2,0). From here, possible directions:\n\nRight: back to (2,1).\n\nUp: row 1, column 0 is *, can't go.\n\nDown: row 3, column 0. Let's check row 3's column 0: o. So can move down. Add 'down' to path.\n\nNow at (3,0). From here, possible directions:\n\nUp: (2,0), already visited.\n\nRight: column 1 is * (row 3's column 1 is *). Can't go right.\n\nDown: row 4, column 0. Let's check row 4, column 0: o (from row 4's first character is o). So can move down. Add 'down' to path.\n\nNow at (4,0). From here, directions:\n\nUp: (3,0), visited.\n\nRight: column 1 is * (row 4's column 1 is *). Can't go right.\n\nDown: row 5, column 0. Let's check row 5's column 0: o (from row 5's first character is o). So move down. Add 'down' to path.\n\nNow at (5,0). From here, directions:\n\nUp: (4,0), visited.\n\nRight: column 1 is * (row 5's column 1 is *). Can't go right.\n\nDown: row 6, column 0. Let's check row 6's column 0. Row 6 is \"ooo*o*ooo*o\". Let me parse it. Original row 6: \"ooo*o*ooo*o\". Assuming 10 characters:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, 9: * ?\n\nSo column 0 is o. So can move down. Add 'down' to path.\n\nNow at (6,0). From here:\n\nUp: (5,0).\n\nRight: column 1 is o. Can move right. Let's go right. Add 'right' to path.\n\nNow at (6,1). From here, can move right again to (6,2), which is o. Add 'right'.\n\nNow at (6,2). Right again to (6,3), but column 3 is * (from row 6's structure). Can't. So from (6,2), directions:\n\nUp: row 5, column 2. Let's check row 5's column 2. Row 5 is \"o*******o*o\". Assuming earlier parsing, row 5's columns after 0 are *s. For example, if row 5 starts with o followed by seven *s, then column 2 would be *. So can't go up. Left: back to (6,1). Down: row 7, column 2. Let's check row 7's column 2. Row 7 is \"o***o***o*o\". Let me parse it as o * * * o * * * o * o? Not sure. Original row 7: \"o***o***o*o\". Assuming 10 characters:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o, 9: * ?\n\nSo column 2 is *, so can't move down. So stuck again. What options do I have here?\n\nFrom (6,2), can I go up? If row 5, column 2 is *, then no. So maybe I need to backtrack. Let's go back to (6,2) and backtrack.\n\nBacktrack from (6,2) to (6,1), then to (6,0). From (6,0), instead of moving right, can I go down? Let's check row 7, column 0. Row 7 is \"o***o***o*o\". Column 0 is o. So can move down. Add 'down' to path.\n\nNow at (7,0). From here, directions:\n\nUp: (6,0).\n\nRight: column 1 is * (row 7's column 1 is *). Can't go right.\n\nDown: row 8, column 0. Row 8 is \"ooooooo*o*o\". Let me parse it. Original row 8: \"ooooooo*o*o\". Assuming columns 0-6 are o's, then * at 7, o at 8, * at 9. So column 0 is o. Can move down. Add 'down' to path.\n\nNow at (8,0). From here, directions:\n\nUp: (7,0).\n\nRight: column 1 is o. Can move right. Let's do that. Add 'right'.\n\nNow at (8,1). Continue right to (8,2), (8,3), etc., as long as possible. Let's see:\n\nRow 8: columns 0-6 are o's. So from (8,0), moving right to (8,1), (8,2), ..., up to (8,6). Let's proceed.\n\nLet me move right repeatedly until I can't. So path adds 'right' multiple times.\n\nFrom (8,0) to (8,6): that's 6 rights. Let me check:\n\n(8,0) → right to (8,1) → add 'right'.\n\n(8,1) → right to (8,2) → add 'right'.\n\n... and so on until (8,6). So after 6 'right's, we're at (8,6). Now, from here, can we move down? Let's check row 9, column 6. Row 9 is \"ooo*ooooooX\". Let me parse it as columns 0-2: o's, column 3: *, columns 4-9: o's and X. So column 6 is o. So can move down. Add 'down' to path.\n\nNow at (9,6). From here, need to reach (9,9). Let's check the path. From (9,6), can move right to (9,7), then right to (9,8), then right to (9,9) which is X. But need to check if those cells are passable.\n\nRow 9: \"ooo*ooooooX\". Let's parse it as columns 0-3: o, o, o, *, then columns 4-9: o, o, o, o, o, X. So columns 4-8 are o's, column 9 is X. So from (9,6), moving right three times would reach X. So path from (9,6) is right, right, right. But need to make sure there are no walls in between.\n\nYes, columns 6,7,8,9 are o, o, o, X. So from (9,6), move right three times to reach X.\n\nBut how to get from (8,6) down to (9,6), then right three times.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe path from start to (8,6) is:\n\nStart → right → right → down → left → left → down → down → down → down → right → right → ... (the earlier steps).\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let me try to outline the entire path step by step, keeping track of the directions.\n\nLet me try to retrace the entire path up to this point:\n\nStarting from (0,0):\n\n1. right → (0,1)\n2. right → (0,2)\n3. down → (1,2)\n4. down → (2,2)\n5. left → (2,1)\n6. left → (2,0)\n7. down → (3,0)\n8. down → (4,0)\n9. down → (5,0)\n10. down → (6,0)\n11. right → (6,1)\n12. right → (6,2)\n13. down → (7,0)? No, earlier I backtracked from (6,2) and went down from (6,0) to (7,0). Let me correct that.\n\nWait, after step 12, I was stuck at (6,2), backtracked to (6,0), then went down to (7,0). So steps after (6,2):\n\nBacktrack: from (6,2) → left to (6,1) → left to (6,0).\n\nThen from (6,0) step 13: down to (7,0).\n\nThen step 14: down to (8,0).\n\nThen step 15: right to (8,1).\n\nThen step 16: right to (8,2).\n\n... continuing until step 15 + 6 steps to reach (8,6). Let's count:\n\nFrom (8,0) to (8,6) requires 6 'right' moves. So steps 15 to 20 (assuming step 15 is first right).\n\nSo total steps up to reaching (8,6) would be:\n\nSteps 1-12, then backtrack steps (not adding to the path), then steps 13 (down from 6,0 to 7,0), 14 (down to 8,0), then 6 rights.\n\nBut the path list is the sequence of directions taken, not backtracking. So when I backtrack, those steps are not part of the final path. So the actual path taken is:\n\nStart → right, right, down, down, left, left, down, down, down, down, down (to 7,0?), then down to 8,0, then rights to 8,6, then down, then rights.\n\nWait, let me try to re-express the correct path without backtracking steps. The backtracking steps are not part of the final path, because when I backtrack, I'm undoing previous moves. So the actual path taken is:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (2,2) via right, right, down, down.\n\nThen from (2,2), left, left to (2,0).\n\nThen down to (3,0), down to (4,0), down to (5,0), down to (6,0).\n\nThen down to (7,0), down to (8,0).\n\nThen right six times to (8,6).\n\nThen down to (9,6).\n\nThen right three times to X.\n\nSo the directions would be:\n\n['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nWait let me count:\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\n1. right (0,1)\n2. right (0,2)\n3. down (1,2)\n4. down (2,2)\n5. left (2,1)\n6. left (2,0)\n7. down (3,0)\n8. down (4,0)\n9. down (5,0)\n10. down (6,0)\n11. down (7,0)\n12. down (8,0)\nNow, from (8,0), moving right 6 times:\n13. right (8,1)\n14. right (8,2)\n15. right (8,3)\n16. right (8,4)\n17. right (8,5)\n18. right (8,6)\nThen down to (9,6):\n19. down (9,6)\nThen right three times:\n20. right (9,7)\n21. right (9,8)\n22. right (9,9) → X.\n\nSo the directions list would be:\n\n['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nBut let's verify if this path is valid.\n\nCheck each step:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nAfter steps 1-2: (0,2).\n\nStep 3: down to (1,2) → valid, since row 1, column 2 is o.\n\nStep 4: down to (2,2) → valid.\n\nSteps 5-6: left to (2,1), then left to (2,0) → valid.\n\nSteps 7-11: down to (3,0), then down to (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0). Each of these rows (3-8) at column 0 are o's? Let's check:\n\nRow 3, column 0: o (yes).\n\nRow 4, column 0: o (yes).\n\nRow 5, column 0: o (yes).\n\nRow 6, column 0: o (yes).\n\nRow 7, column 0: o (yes).\n\nRow 8, column 0: o (yes).\n\nYes.\n\nThen steps 12-18: moving right from (8,0) to (8,6). Each column from 0-6 in row 8 is o. Yes, as per row 8's structure: \"ooooooo*o*o\" → first seven o's, then * at 7. So columns 0-6 are o.\n\nStep 19: down to (9,6). Row 9, column 6: in row 9, columns 0-2 are o, column 3 is *, columns 4-8 are o, column 9 is X. So column 6 is o → valid.\n\nSteps 20-22: moving right three times from (9,6) to (9,9). Columns 6,7,8,9 are o, o, o, X → valid.\n\nSo this path is valid.\n\nNow, the directions list is as above. Let me count the number of each direction:\n\n- right: steps 1, 2, 13-18 (6 times), 20-22 (3 times) → total 2+6+3= 11 rights? Wait:\n\nOriginal list:\n\n['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nCount:\n\nRights: positions 0, 1, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 → total 11 rights?\n\nLet me count:\n\nSteps 1 and 2: 2 rights.\n\nSteps 12-17: 6 rights (steps 12 to 17 inclusive? Let me check the indices. In the list above, after the 5 downs (steps 7-11), the next is step 12 (right), then step 13 (right), up to step 17 (sixth right). So that's 6 rights.\n\nThen step 19 is 'down', step 20 is right, 21 is right, 22 is right → three more rights. Total rights: 2 + 6 + 3 = 11.\n\nDowns: steps 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 18 → total 8 downs?\n\nSteps 3 and 4: 2 downs.\n\nSteps 7-11: 5 downs (steps 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).\n\nStep 18: down (step 18).\n\nTotal downs: 2 + 5 + 1 = 8.\n\nLefts: steps 5 and 6: 2 lefts.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the directions list is correct.\n\nNow, let me check if there's a shorter path, but since the problem doesn't specify to find the shortest, just any valid path, this should be acceptable.\n\nBut let me see if there's an alternative path that might be shorter. For example, perhaps there's a way to go from (0,0) right to (0,1), down to (1,1) is a wall, no. Or other routes. But given the time I've spent, this path seems valid.\n\nSo the final answer would be the list of directions as outlined.\n ;Answer: ['right','right','down','down','left','left','down','down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right','right','right','down','right','right','right']"

The other cells are either 'o' (passable) or '*' (walls). Let me parse the given maze:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o o o\nRow 1: o * o * * * o * *\nRow 2: o * o o o * o * o o o? Wait, the input for the second row is \"o*ooo*ooo\"—wait, maybe I need to check again. Let me re-express each row properly. Let me list them one by one:\n\nOriginal Maze Board:\n\nLine 1: Ioooooooo → Row 0: ['I','o','o','o','o','o','o','o','o']\nLine 2: o*o***o** → Row 1: ['o','*','o','*','*','*','o','*','*']\nLine 3: o*ooo*ooo → Row 2: ['o','*','o','o','o','*','o','o','o']\nLine 4: ******o** → Row 3: ['*','*','*','*','*','*','o','*','*']\nLine 5: oooooooo o → Wait, the fifth line is \"ooooooooo\"—Row 4: ['o','o','o','o','o','o','o','o','o']\nWait, original input is:\n\nMaze Board:\nIoooooooo\no*o***o**\no*ooo*ooo\n******o**\nooooooooo\no***o*o**\no*ooo*ooo\no*******o\no*ooooooX\n\nSo rows 0 to 8:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o o o\nRow 1: o * o * * * o * *\nRow 2: o * o o o * o o o\nRow 3: * * * * * * o * *\nRow 4: o o o o o o o o o\nRow 5: o * * * o * o * *\nRow 6: o * o o o * o o o\nRow 7: o * * * * * * * o\nRow 8: o * o o o o o o X\n\nNow, I need to find a path from the start (I) at position (0,0) to X at (8,8). Let me note the positions.\n\nFirst, let me find the starting point. The 'I' is at (0,0). The 'X' is in row 8, column 8.\n\nNow, the challenge is to navigate through the maze. Let's think of possible paths. Since the maze can have multiple paths, but I need to find one. Let's try to do a BFS (Breadth-First Search) approach mentally, or maybe track step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). From here, possible moves: can we go down or right? Since the first row is all 'o's except for row 1's restrictions.\n\nLet me think about possible directions. From (0,0), possible moves:\n\n- Down to (1,0): check if that cell is passable. Row 1, column 0 is 'o' (from the second line: first character is 'o'). So yes. Or right to (0,1), which is 'o' as well. So maybe there are multiple paths, but I need to find one.\n\nBut perhaps I should plan a route. Let me try to sketch the path step by step.\n\nLet me try to outline possible paths. Let's start.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's try moving down first. Let's see:\n\nFrom (0,0), down to (1,0). Then, from (1,0), what can we do? Let's check the surrounding cells.\n\nRow 1, column 0 is 'o'. Let's look around. From (1,0), can we go down to (2,0)? Let's check row 2, column 0: it's 'o' (from row 2's first character is 'o'). So yes. So down again. Now at (2,0). Then down again to (3,0)? But row 3, column 0 is '*', which is a wall. Can't go there. So from (2,0), possible directions: down is blocked. So can we go right or left? Left would be out of bounds. So right. Let's check.\n\nFrom (2,0), moving right. Let's check row 2's cells. The row is o * o o o * o o o. Wait row 2 is \"o*ooo*ooo\"—so columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o. So from (2,0), moving right to (2,1) is a '*', which is blocked. So that's not allowed. So from (2,0), right is blocked. So what else? Can we go up? Back to (1,0)? But that's where we came from. Maybe we need to go right when possible. Wait, perhaps there's another way. Let me think again.\n\nFrom (1,0), maybe instead of going down again, we can go right? Let's check. From (1,0), can we go right? Let's see row 1's cells. Row 1 is o * o * * * o * *. So column 0 is o, column 1 is *, so can't go right to (1,1). So from (1,0), right is blocked. So the only options from (1,0) are down (to (2,0)) and up (back to start, which isn't helpful). So from (2,0), perhaps moving right isn't possible. So maybe need to go up? Not helpful. Hmm, maybe this path is a dead end. Let me backtrack.\n\nAlternative approach: From the start (0,0), instead of going down, go right. Let's see. Starting at (0,0), moving right to (0,1). Then (0,2), etc. Since row 0 is all o's except the starting I. Wait, row 0 is I followed by o's. So moving right along row 0. Let's say we go all the way to the right? But maybe that's not the best approach. Let's think.\n\nIf we go right in row 0 to, say, (0, 4), then down. But need to find a way through the maze. Let me try.\n\nFrom (0,0), moving right to (0,1), then (0,2)... all the way to (0,8)? But then, need to get down. However, looking at row 1, there are walls starting from column 1. Let me think. Let's try moving down early.\n\nFor example, from (0,0), move right once to (0,1), then down to (1,1). But (1,1) is a '*' (wall). Can't do that. So maybe from (0,0), move down first to (1,0), then right? But earlier that didn't work. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe go down to row 0, then right as far as possible where down is possible.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find a path that snakes through the maze. Let me try to outline the maze again, perhaps noting possible passages.\n\nLooking at the maze:\n\nRow 0: All open except start. So from (0,0), can move right or down.\n\nRow 1 has a wall at column 1, then open at column 2, then walls from 3-5, then open at 6, then walls 7-8.\n\nRow 2 has a wall at column 1, open at column 2, open 3-4, wall at 5, then open 6-8.\n\nRow 3 is all walls except column 6.\n\nRow 4 is all open. So that's a big open area.\n\nRow 5 has walls at 1-3, open at 4, wall at 5, open at 6, then walls at 7-8.\n\nRow 6: similar to row 2? o * o o o * o o o. So columns 0 is o, 1 is *, 2-4 o, 5 *, 6-8 o.\n\nRow 7: o followed by walls from 1-7, then o at 8.\n\nRow 8: o * o o o o o o X. So columns 0 is o, 1 *, then columns 2-7 o, and X at 8.\n\nSo the X is at (8,8). Let me think of possible routes.\n\nOne possible way is to get to row 4, which is all open, then navigate from there.\n\nLet me try to find a path:\n\nStart at (0,0). Let's go down to (1,0). Then down to (2,0). From (2,0), can't go down (row 3, column 0 is wall). So maybe move right. But (2,0) can we go right? Let's check row 2: column 0 is o, column 1 is *, so can't go right. So stuck? So perhaps need to backtrack. So from (2,0), back up to (1,0), then maybe right? No, because (1,0) can't go right. Hmm. So maybe this path is blocked. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative path: From (0,0), move right to (0,1), (0,2), then down. Let's see. For example, from (0,2), down to row 1, column 2. Row 1, column 2 is 'o' (since row 1 is o * o * * * o * *, columns 0-2: o, *, o). So yes, (1,2) is o. So from (0,2) down to (1,2). Now at (1,2). From here, can we move down to row 2, column 2? Row 2, column 2 is o. Yes. So down to (2,2). Then, perhaps continue down? Let's check row 3, column 2: row 3 is all * except column 6. So row 3, column 2 is *, which is a wall. So can't go down. So from (2,2), options: move right or left or up. Let's try moving right. From (2,2), moving right to (2,3). That's allowed (row 2, columns 3 is o). Then right to (2,4). Also o. Then maybe down? From (2,4), down to row 3, column 4. But row 3, column 4 is * (since row 3 is all * except column 6). So no. So perhaps move further right. From (2,4), moving right to (2,5) which is * (wall). Can't. So back to (2,4), maybe down isn't possible. Let's go up? Or left? Or move right to (2,5) is blocked. So perhaps from (2,4), move left back to (2,3), then up?\n\nAlternatively, from (2,2) and (2,3), maybe move up? Not helpful. Maybe move right to (2,4) and then go right? No. So perhaps from (2,4), need to go up. Let's try. So back up to (1,4). Let's check row 1, column 4: row 1 is columns 0-5: o, *, o, *, *, *. So column 4 is *, wall. Can't go up there. So stuck again. Hmm. Maybe this path isn't working. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: From (1,2), maybe move right. Let's see. From (1,2), right to (1,3) which is *, blocked. Can't. So from (1,2), can we move up? Back to (0,2). Then right? Maybe. From (0,2), move right to (0,3), then down to (1,3)? No, that's a wall. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe there's another way.\n\nLet me think of another starting path. From (0,0), go all the way right to (0, some column) then down. Let's say, for example, go right to (0,6). Let's see. From (0,0) moving right 6 times to (0,6). Then down to row 1, column 6. Row 1, column 6 is 'o' (from row 1's description: o * o * * * o * * → columns 6 is o). So down to (1,6). From there, can we go down to (2,6)? Let's check row 2, column 6: yes, row 2's columns up to 6: o*ooo*... so column 6 is o. So down to (2,6). Then down to row 3, column 6: which is o (since row 3's column 6 is o). So (3,6). From there, maybe go down to row 4, column 6. Row 4 is all o's. So yes. Now at (4,6). Now we're in the open row. From there, maybe navigate towards the X. Let's think.\n\nFrom (4,6), perhaps move left, right, up, down. Let me try moving towards the bottom. Let's see. From (4,6), down to row 5, column 6. Row 5, column 6 is 'o'? Let's check row 5: o***o*o**. So row 5 is columns 0-8:\n\no, *, *, *, o, *, o, *, *.\n\nSo column 6 is 'o'. Yes. So down to (5,6). From there, can we go down to row 6, column 6? Row 6: o*ooo*ooo. So column 6 is o. Yes. Down to (6,6). Then down to row 7, column 6. Row 7 is o followed by walls. Let's check row 7, column 6: row 7 is o*******o. Columns 0 is o, then 1-7 are *, and column 8 is o. So column 6 is *, so can't go there. So from (6,6), can't go down. So need to move elsewhere. From (6,6), perhaps move right? Let's check. Row 6, column 6 is o. Moving right to (6,7): o? Row 6 is o*ooo*ooo. Columns 6-8: o, o, o. So yes. So move right to (6,7), then (6,8). From (6,8), down to row 7, column 8 (which is o), then down to row 8, column 8 (X). Let me check:\n\nFrom (6,8): down to (7,8) which is o (row 7's column 8 is o). Then down to (8,8), which is X. So that's possible. Let's see if that path is feasible.\n\nSo let's recap the steps up to here:\n\nStart at (0,0) → right 6 times to (0,6) → down to (1,6) → down to (2,6) → down to (3,6) → down to (4,6) → down to (5,6) → down to (6,6) → right to (6,7) → right to (6,8) → down to (7,8) → down to (8,8).\n\nNow, let's check if each of these steps is possible, and also if there are any walls in between.\n\nYes, seems okay. Let me check each step:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (0,6): moving right 6 steps. All o's in row 0.\n\nThen down to (1,6): allowed, since row 1, column 6 is o.\n\nDown to (2,6): allowed, row 2, column 6 is o.\n\nDown to (3,6): allowed, row 3, column 6 is o.\n\nDown to (4,6): allowed, row 4 all o.\n\nDown to (5,6): allowed, row 5, column 6 is o.\n\nDown to (6,6): allowed, row 6, column 6 is o.\n\nThen right to (6,7): allowed, since row 6, columns 6-8 are o's.\n\nThen right to (6,8): same.\n\nDown to (7,8): allowed, since row 7, column 8 is o.\n\nDown to (8,8): X. Yes.\n\nSo this path works. Now, let's translate these steps into the required move directions. Each move is up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's track each movement:\n\nStarting at (0,0).\n\nFirst, moving right 6 times: from column 0 to 6. So 6 'right's.\n\nThen down 4 times: from row 0 to row 1 (down), row 2 (down again), row 3 (down), row 4 (down), row 5 (down), row 6 (down). Wait, how many steps?\n\nFrom (0,6) to (1,6): down.\n\nThen (1,6) to (2,6): down.\n\n(2,6) to (3,6): down.\n\n(3,6) to (4,6): down.\n\n(4,6) to (5,6): down.\n\n(5,6) to (6,6): down. So total of 6 down steps? Wait, from row 0 to row 6 is 6 steps down. Wait, original position after right 6 steps is (0,6). Then down steps to reach row 6, column 6. So from row 0 to row 6: 6 down moves. So that's 6 'down's.\n\nThen, from (6,6) to (6,8): two 'right's.\n\nThen from (6,8) down to (7,8): down.\n\nThen from (7,8) down to (8,8): down.\n\nSo total moves:\n\n['right'] *6 + ['down']*6 + ['right', 'right', 'down', 'down'] ?\n\nWait let's count:\n\nRight 6 times: 6 moves.\n\nDown from (0,6) to (6,6): that's 6 steps (row 0→1→2→3→4→5→6: 6 moves down).\n\nThen from (6,6) to (6,8): two 'right's.\n\nThen down from (6,8) to (7,8): one 'down'.\n\nThen down from (7,8) to (8,8): one 'down'.\n\nTotal moves: 6 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 16 moves.\n\nBut let me verify the exact steps:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nMove 1: right → (0,1)\n\nMove 2: right → (0,2)\n\nMove 3: right → (0,3)\n\nMove 4: right → (0,4)\n\nMove 5: right → (0,5)\n\nMove 6: right → (0,6)\n\nThen down steps:\n\nMove 7: down → (1,6)\n\nMove 8: down → (2,6)\n\nMove 9: down → (3,6)\n\nMove 10: down → (4,6)\n\nMove 11: down → (5,6)\n\nMove 12: down → (6,6)\n\nThen right steps:\n\nMove 13: right → (6,7)\n\nMove 14: right → (6,8)\n\nThen down steps:\n\nMove 15: down → (7,8)\n\nMove 16: down → (8,8)\n\nYes, 16 moves total. So the list would be:\n\n['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']\n\nBut let me check if there's any shorter path, or if there's any mistake in the steps. Also, maybe there's a more optimal path, but this seems valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a path that takes fewer steps, but since the problem just requires a valid path, not necessarily the shortest, this should be acceptable.\n\nBut let me check if there are any walls in the way. For example, when moving down from row 0 to row 6, column 6. All those rows have o at column 6?\n\nRow 0: yes (it's o).\n\nRow 1: yes (o at column 6).\n\nRow 2: yes (o at column 6).\n\nRow 3: yes (o at column 6).\n\nRow 4: yes.\n\nRow 5: yes (row 5, column 6 is o? Let me check row 5: the fifth line is o***o*o**. Let me parse that as:\n\nRow 5: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *.\n\nYes, column 6 is o. So yes. So moving down through those is valid.\n\nYes, this path works. So the answer would be the list of moves as described.\n\nBut let me check if there's another possible path that might be easier or if there's any mistake. For example, maybe there's a way to go through row 4 earlier.\n\nAnother possible path: From the starting point, go down to row 4 via another route. Let's think. But the previous path seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (0,0) go down to (1,0), then right to (1,2), down to (2,2), then right to (2,4), then... but earlier that path hit a dead end. Let me see.\n\nBut maybe from (2,4), can we move down? No, because row 3, column 4 is blocked. So perhaps from (2,4) move up to (1,4), but that's a wall. So no. So that path is blocked. So the previous path is better.\n\nAnother possible alternative: Let's see if there's a way through row 4, column 0. But row 3, column 0 is a wall, so can't get there. So no.\n\nSo the path I found seems valid. Now, translating the moves into the required format.\n\nThe moves are:\n\nRight six times, then down six times, then right twice, then down twice.\n\nSo the list would be:\n\n[\"right\", \"right\", \"right\", \"right\", \"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"down\", \"down\", \"down\", \"down\", \"down\", \"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"down\"]\n\nLet me count again to make sure:\n\nRight 6: 6 entries.\n\nDown 6: 6 entries.\n\nRight 2: 2 entries.\n\nDown 2: 2 entries. Total 6+6+2+2=16 entries. Correct.\n\nBut let me check the steps again. From (6,6) to (6,8) requires two 'right's. Then from there, down to (7,8) (one 'down'), then down to (8,8) (another 'down'). Yes.\n\nSo this should be the correct path. Therefore, the answer is that list.\n ;Answer: ['right','right','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','right','right','down','down']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this maze. The maze is 11x11, right? Let me start by visualizing the maze. The first line is I followed by several o's and a *, then o again. The starting point is at position (0,0) if we consider rows and columns. The destination X is at the end of the last line. Let me try to map out the positions.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where exactly 'I' and 'X' are. The first row is \"Ioooooooo*\", so the 'I' is at (0,0). The X is in the 11th row (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), looking at the last line: \"o*o*o*o*ooX\". Let me count the columns. Each row has 11 characters. For the last row (row 10?), the X is at column 10, since the string ends with X. So the destination is (10,10).\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (10,10), moving up, down, left, right through 'o's and avoiding '*'. Since the problem allows me to output the list of moves, I should probably use a pathfinding algorithm like BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the shortest path, or maybe DFS if there's only one path. But since mazes can have multiple paths, BFS is better for finding the shortest one.\n\nLet me think about how to represent the maze. Each cell can be represented as (row, column). The starting position is (0,0). The goal is (10,10). Now, I need to parse the maze. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o o o * o\nRow 1: o * o * * * o * * * o\nRow 2: o * o o o * o o o o o\nRow 3: o * o * * * o * * * *\nRow 4: o * o * o * o o o o o\nRow 5: o * * * o * o * o * *\nRow 6: o o o o o * o * o o o\nRow 7: o * o * o * o * o * o\nRow 8: o * o * o * o * o * o\nRow 9: o * o * o * o * o * *\nRow 10: o * o * o * o * o o X\n\nWait, maybe I should write down the coordinates for each cell. Let me try to note the positions where it's passable. For example, starting at (0,0), which is 'I', then (0,1) is 'o', so that's passable. But (0,9) is '*', and (0,10) is 'o'? Wait the first row is \"Ioooooooo*\", then ends with 'o'? Let me check again:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nMaze Board:\nIoooooooo*o\no*o***o***o\no*ooo*ooooo\no*o***o****\no*o*o*ooooo\no***o*o*o**\nooooo*o*ooo\no*o*o*o*o*o\no*o*o*o*o*o\no*o*o*o*o**\no*o*o*o*ooX\n\nEach line is 11 characters. Let me check first line: I followed by 8 o's, then *, then o? Let's count:\n\n\"I o o o o o o o o * o\" → positions 0-10. So (0,0) is I, (0,1) o, ..., (0,8) o, (0,9) *, (0,10) o. So starting at (0,0), can we move right to (0,1)? Yes. Also, can we move down to (1,0)? Let's check row 1, column 0 is 'o', which is passable.\n\nNow, the plan is to perform BFS from (0,0) to (10,10). Let's think about how to implement this mentally. Each node is a position (r, c). For each node, we track the path taken to get there, or at least track the directions taken. BFS will explore all possible moves level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\nLet me start by initializing a queue. The queue starts with the starting position (0,0), and perhaps track the path taken to get there. Also, we need to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nInitialize a queue with (row, column, path_so_far). Start with (0, 0, []).\n\nVisited set starts with (0,0).\n\nWhile queue is not empty:\n\nDequeue the front element.\n\nCheck if current position is the destination (10,10). If yes, return the path.\n\nOtherwise, for each possible direction (up, down, left, right):\n\nCalculate new_row and new_col based on direction.\n\nCheck if new_row and new_col are within 0-10 (since it's 11x11).\n\nCheck if the cell is 'o' or 'X' (since we can pass through 'o' and the destination).\n\nAlso, check if (new_row, new_col) is not visited.\n\nIf all conditions met, enqueue the new position with updated path, and mark as visited.\n\nBut since the maze is given as a list of strings, I need to check the character at (new_row, new_col) is not '*'.\n\nWait, the starting point is 'I', and the destination is 'X'. All other positions are either 'o', '*' etc. So during movement, except for the start and end, the cells must be 'o' or 'X'.\n\nBut during BFS, when moving to a cell, except for the destination, the cell must be 'o' or I/X? Well, the start is 'I', but once we leave it, other cells need to be passable.\n\nSo for each move, when checking if the next cell is allowed:\n\nIf it's the destination (X), then we can move there. Otherwise, it must be 'o'.\n\nSo during BFS, for each new_row and new_col, we need to check:\n\nIf the cell is within bounds.\n\nIf the cell is not a wall (i.e., not '*').\n\nFor the destination cell (10,10), it's 'X', which is allowed.\n\nSo during BFS processing, for each neighbor cell, check if it's in the maze, not a wall, and not visited.\n\nNow, let me think about how to represent the maze. Let's imagine each row as a list of characters. For example, row 0 is \"Ioooooooo*o\", so the characters are:\n\nrow 0: [ 'I', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', '*', 'o' ]\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nSo, for any (r, c), check if maze[r][c] is not '*'.\n\nNow, let's try to perform BFS step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's check possible directions.\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\nPossible moves:\n\nup: invalid (row -1)\n\ndown: (1, 0). Check if it's allowed. maze[1][0] is 'o' → allowed.\n\nleft: invalid (col -1)\n\nright: (0,1) → 'o' allowed.\n\nSo enqueue (1,0, ['down']) and (0,1, ['right']). Mark them as visited.\n\nNow, the queue has these two.\n\nLet me think about BFS steps. Since I can't actually write code here, I need to simulate mentally.\n\nBut doing this for 11x11 is going to be tedious, but perhaps I can find a path by looking at the maze.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a visible path.\n\nLooking at the maze:\n\nStart at (0,0). Let's try to find a path manually.\n\nRow 0: I (0,0), then o's until column 8 is *, then column 9 is *, column 10 is o. So from (0,0), moving right to (0,1), (0,2)... up to (0,8) is o. But (0,9) is *, so can't go there. But (0,10) is o. So maybe possible to go all the way to (0,10)? But how? Let me check if there's a path from (0,0) going right all the way. Wait, (0,0) can go right to (0,1), which is o. Then continue to (0,2)... up to (0,8). Then (0,9) is *, so can't go there. (0,10) is o. Wait, how? Because between (0,8) and (0,9) is *, but (0,9) is *, then (0,10) is o. So from (0,8), can't move right to (0,9). But maybe from (0,8), moving down?\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8 is o. Let me check row 1, column 8. Row 1 is \"o*o***o***o\". Let me parse row 1:\n\nRow 1: positions 0 to 10:\n\n0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: o, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o.\n\nSo (1,8) is o. So from (0,8), moving down to (1,8) is allowed.\n\nSo maybe a possible path is:\n\nStart at (0,0). Move right to (0,1), (0,2)... up to (0,8). Then down to (1,8). Then perhaps continue moving down or right?\n\nBut let's try to outline a possible path.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's try to find the path step by step.\n\nAnother approach: since the destination is at (10,10), which is bottom-right corner, perhaps the path needs to snake through the maze, avoiding walls.\n\nLooking at the maze's last few rows:\n\nRow 7 to 10 have a lot of * and o. For example, rows 7-10 seem to have patterns like o*o*o*o*o*o, etc. So maybe the path goes through the even columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to move down from the starting point.\n\nOriginal starting position (0,0). Let's try moving down first. From (0,0) down to (1,0). Row 1, column 0 is o. Then from (1,0), possible moves: up (back to start?), down to (2,0), left invalid, right to (1,1) which is * (impassable). So moving down again to (2,0). Row 2, column 0 is o. Then again down to (3,0), which is o. Row 3, column 0 is o. Then down to (4,0) o. Then down to (5,0) o. Wait, row 5, column 0 is o? Let me check:\n\nRow 5: \"o***o*o*o**\" → first character is o. Yes. So (5,0) is o. Continue down to (6,0). Row 6: \"ooooo*o*ooo\" → first character o. Then (7,0) is o? Row 7 starts with o? Let me check row 7: \"o*o*o*o*o*o\" → yes, (7,0) is o. Then down to (8,0): o? Row 8 starts with o? Yes. Row 8: same as row 7? Let me check the input again. The 8th line (assuming rows are 0-indexed):\n\nRow 7: o*o*o*o*o*o\n\nRow 8: o*o*o*o*o*o\n\nRow 9: o*o*o*o*o**\n\nRow 10: o*o*o*o*ooX\n\nSo from (7,0) down to (8,0) is o. Then down to (9,0) is o? Row 9, column 0 is o. Then down to (10, 0) which is o. Now, at (10,0), need to get to (10,10). But row 10 is \"o*o*o*o*ooX\". Let's check columns for row 10:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: o, 10: X.\n\nSo at (10,0), to reach X at (10,10), need to move right, but columns 1,3,5,7 are *.\n\nSo from (10,0), can move right to column 2 (o), but then can't go further right to column 3 (*). So perhaps from (10,2), need to move up?\n\nBut how to get from (10,0) to (10,2). From (10,0), move right twice. But that's allowed. Then from (10,2), maybe move up to row 9, column 2. Let's check row 9, column 2: o? Row 9 is \"o*o*o*o*o**\". Let's parse:\n\nRow 9: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: *.\n\nSo (9,2) is o. From (10,2), up to (9,2). Then from there, maybe move right to (9,2) → (9,4) is o? Yes. Then down again? But need to find a way to get to the right.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe the path down the left side isn't the best approach. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative approach: from the starting position, move right as much as possible. Let's try that.\n\nStart at (0,0). Move right to (0,1), (0,2)... up to (0,8). Because (0,9) is *, can't go there. Then from (0,8), can we move down? Let's check row 1, column 8. As before, row 1, column 8 is o. So down to (1,8). Now at (1,8). Let's look around. From here, can we move down to (2,8)? Row 2, column 8 is o (row 2: o*ooo*ooooo → let me parse row 2:\n\nRow 2: \"o*ooo*ooooo\". Let's split into columns:\n\n0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o. So yes, (2,8) is o. So down to (2,8). From there, can we move down again to (3,8)? Let's check row 3, column 8. Row 3 is \"o*o***o****\". Columns:\n\n0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: o, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: *. So (3,8) is o. Down to (3,8). Now, from (3,8), possible directions: down would be (4,8). Let's check row 4, column 8: row 4 is \"o*o*o*ooooo\". Columns:\n\n0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o. Wait, row 4: \"o*o*o*ooooo\". Let me parse again:\n\nBreaking down row 4: o * o * o * o o o o o ?\n\nYes. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o. So (4,8) is o. So moving down to (4,8). Then down to (5,8). Let's check row 5, column 8. Row 5 is \"o***o*o*o**\". Let's parse:\n\nRow 5: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: *. So (5,8) is o. From here, can we move down to (6,8)? Row 6 is \"ooooo*o*ooo\". Let me check column 8: row 6, column 8. Row 6: columns 0-5 are o's, then column 6 is *, column 7 is o, column 8 is *, column 9 is o, column 10 is o. Wait:\n\nRow 6: \"ooooo*o*ooo\". Let's break down:\n\n0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o? Or maybe I'm miscounting. Let me count the characters. Original string: \"ooooo*o*ooo\" → 5 o's, then *, o, *, ooo. Total length 5+1+1+1+3 = 11. So columns:\n\n0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o. Yes. So (6,8) is o. So moving down to (6,8). Then down to (7,8). Row 7: \"o*o*o*o*o*o\". Column 8: let's see, for row 7, columns alternate o and *. Since it's o*o*o*o*o*o, which for 11 columns would be o at even indices (0,2,4,6,8,10). So column 8 is o. So (7,8) is o. Down to (8,8): same as row 7? Row 8 is same as row 7? Let me check. The input says row 8 is \"o*o*o*o*o*o\". Yes. So (8,8) is o. Down to (9,8). Row 9 is \"o*o*o*o*o**\". Columns for row 9: same pattern up to column 8? Let's parse: o*o*o*o*o**. For columns 0-8: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o. Then columns 9 and 10 are *. So (9,8) is o. Down to (10,8). Row 10, column 8: looking at row 10's string \"o*o*o*o*ooX\". Let's parse:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: o, 10: X. So (10,8) is o. Now, from (10,8), need to get to (10,10). From (10,8), can move right to (10,9) which is o, then right to (10,10) which is X. So that's possible! \n\nSo the path from (0,0) would be:\n\nRight to (0,1) ... up to (0,8). Then down through rows 1-10 to (10,8). Then right twice to reach X. \n\nLet me check if this path is valid. Let me verify each step:\n\nStarting at (0,0). Moving right 8 times to (0,8). Then down 10 times (from row 0 to row 10) to (10,8). Then right two steps to (10,10). \n\nBut wait, moving down from row 0 to row 10 would require 10 down moves. But during that path, each step down must be allowed. Let me check each of those positions:\n\nFrom (0,8) down to (1,8): allowed, as discussed.\n\n(1,8) down to (2,8): allowed.\n\n(2,8) down to (3,8): allowed.\n\n(3,8) down to (4,8): allowed.\n\n(4,8) down to (5,8): allowed.\n\n(5,8) down to (6,8): allowed.\n\n(6,8) down to (7,8): allowed.\n\n(7,8) down to (8,8): allowed.\n\n(8,8) down to (9,8): allowed.\n\n(9,8) down to (10,8): allowed. Yes, row 10, column 8 is o. \n\nSo that's 10 down moves from (0,8) to (10,8). Then from (10,8), two right moves to reach (10,10). \n\nSo the total moves would be:\n\nRight 8 times (from 0,0 to 0,8), then down 10 times, then right 2 times. \n\nBut converting that into the list of directions:\n\nStarting at (0,0), moving right 8 times → 8 'right's.\n\nThen down 10 times → 10 'down's.\n\nThen right twice → 2 'right's.\n\nBut wait, from (10,8) to (10,9) is right, then (10,9) to (10,10) is right again. \n\nSo the total path would be:\n\n['right', 'right', ..., 'right' (8 times), 'down', ... 'down' (10 times), 'right', 'right'].\n\nBut let me check if there are any walls along this path. For example, when moving down through the columns, are there any walls in between? For example, in row 3, column 8 is o, and row 4, column 8 is o. All steps seem allowed. \n\nBut let me check for row 3, column 8. The row 3 is \"o*o***o****\". So column 8 is o. Yes. And row 4 column 8 is o. \n\nAnother check: row 5 column 8 is o. Yes. \n\nRow 6 column 8 is o. Yes. \n\nRow 7 column 8 is o. Yes. \n\nRow 8 column 8 is o. Yes. \n\nRow 9 column 8 is o. Yes. \n\nRow 10 column 8 is o. Yes. \n\nSo this path seems valid. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any alternative paths that might be shorter. Because the problem doesn't specify that the path has to be the shortest, but perhaps the BFS would find the shortest. However, the example given in the problem uses a list, so any valid path is acceptable. \n\nBut let's see if this path is valid. \n\nSo the moves would be:\n\nStart at (0,0). \n\nMove right 8 times: positions (0,1) to (0,8). \n\nThen move down 10 times: from row 0 to row 10, column 8. \n\nThen move right twice: to (10,9) and (10,10). \n\nSo the directions list would be:\n\n['right'] * 8 + ['down'] * 10 + ['right'] * 2. \n\nBut let me count the steps. \n\nBut wait, from (0,8) to (10,8) requires 10 down moves? Because from row 0 to row 10 is 10 steps down (since each down increases row by 1). For example, row 0 down once is row 1, down again to row 2... down 10 times gets to row 10. Yes. \n\nSo that's 8 + 10 + 2 = 20 moves. \n\nIs there a shorter path? Maybe. But given the maze structure, perhaps this is a valid path. \n\nBut let me check if there are any walls blocking this path. For example, when moving down from row 0 to row 1 to 2, etc. \n\nAnother thing to check: when moving down from row 0, column 8, to row 1, column 8. Let me check what's in row 1, column 8. As before, row 1 is \"o*o***o***o\". Let me split it:\n\nRow 1: o * o * * * o * * * o \n\nColumns 0-10. Column 8 is o. Yes. \n\nSo that's okay. \n\nAnother check: row 3, column 8 is o. Row 3 is \"o*o***o****\". Let me see: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: o, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: *. Yes, column 8 is o. \n\nSo all steps are valid. \n\nTherefore, this path is valid. \n\nSo the answer would be a list of directions: 8 'right's, then 10 'down's, then 2 'right's. \n\nBut let me verify once more. \n\nLet me simulate the movement:\n\nStarting position: (0,0).\n\nAfter 8 'right's: (0, 8). \n\nThen 10 'down's: (10, 8). \n\nThen 2 'right's: (10, 9), then (10,10). \n\nYes. \n\nNow, the problem says the output should be a list of the directions. So the answer would be:\n\n['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right']\n\nBut let me count the number of each:\n\n8 'right's: positions 0-7 (eight moves to get to column 8).\n\nThen 10 'down's (positions 8-17).\n\nThen 2 'right's (positions 18-19). \n\nTotal of 20 moves. \n\nBut let me check if there are any obstacles in between. For example, when moving down from row 0 to row 10 in column 8, is there any * in that column?\n\nLooking at each row's column 8:\n\nRow 0: o (allowed)\nRow 1: o\nRow 2: o\nRow 3: o\nRow 4: o\nRow 5: o\nRow 6: o\nRow 7: o\nRow 8: o\nRow 9: o\nRow 10: o \n\nYes. All are passable. \n\nSo this path is valid. \n\nTherefore, the answer is this list of directions. \n\nBut let me check if there's any mistake in the maze parsing. For example, row 5, column 8 is o? Let me recheck row 5's string: \"o***o*o*o**\". Let me parse it as follows:\n\nRow 5: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: *. Yes, column 8 is o. \n\nRow 6's column 8: row 6 is \"ooooo*o*ooo\". As discussed earlier, column 8 is o. \n\nRow 7's column 8: o. \n\nRow 8's column 8: o. \n\nRow 9's column 8: o. \n\nRow 10's column 8: o. \n\nAll good. \n\nSo this path is valid. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be the list of directions as described.\n ;Answer: ['right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','right','right']"

    "response": [
      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this maze. The maze is 11x11, right? Let me first try to visualize it. The user provided the maze as a series of strings. Let me write them down properly.\n\nThe first row is I followed by ten 'o's. Then the next rows have various * and o. Let me map out the coordinates. Let's assume rows are numbered from 0 to 10, and columns 0 to 10. The start 'I' is at (0,0). The destination 'X' is in the last row, let me check: the last line is o*o***o*o*X. So the X is at column 9 or 10? Let me count. The last line is o*o***o*o*X. Let's break it down:\n\nEach character is a cell. For row 10 (assuming rows are 0-based), the columns:\n\n0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: o, 6: *, 7: o, 8: *, 9: o, 10: X? Wait, the input line is \"o*o***o*o*X\". Let me count the characters. Let's see:\n\nOriginal line given: o*o***o*o*X. Let me count each character:\n\no * o * * * o * o * X → that's 11 characters. So for row 10, columns 0-10:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: *\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: X?\n\nWait, no. Let me recount:\n\nOriginal line is \"o*o***o*o*X\". Let me split it:\n\no * o * * * o * o * X → that's 11 elements. So the X is at position 10. So the destination is at (10,10). \n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (10,10), moving up, down, left, right, avoiding the walls (*).\n\nFirst, perhaps I should represent the maze as a grid. Let me try to note down the positions of walls and open spaces. But maybe it's easier to do a step-by-step pathfinding. Since the user wants the path as a list of directions, perhaps a BFS approach would be best to find the shortest path, but since the user didn't specify shortest, maybe any valid path is okay. But probably, the user expects a correct path, regardless of being shortest.\n\nBut how to approach this manually? Let me try to sketch the maze mentally.\n\nRow 0: I (start at 0,0) followed by o's all the way to column 10. So row 0 is all open except maybe nothing. Wait, the first line is \"Ioooooooooo\". So row 0 is I (0,0), then columns 1-10 are o's. So from (0,0), possible moves are right or down. Since (0,0) is the start. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nLooking at the maze structure. Let me try to see if there's a way to go down first. Let me try to outline a possible path.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's try to move down as much as possible. Let me check each row.\n\nRow 0: (0,0). Let's move down to row 1, column 0. Row 1's first cell is 'o' (since the input line for row 1 is \"o*o*****o**\", so first character is o. So (1,0) is o, passable. Then row 2, column 0: check row 2's first character is 'o'? Let me check row 2: \"o*ooooo*ooo\". First character is o. So (2,0) is passable. Similarly, row 3's first character is o? Row 3: \"o*o***o*o*o\" → first is o. So (3,0). But then, looking ahead, maybe there are walls blocking downward movement. Let me check for each row:\n\nRow 0: (0,0)\n\nRow 1: (1,0) is o.\n\nRow 2: (2,0) o.\n\nRow 3: (3,0) o.\n\nRow 4: (4,0) is row 4's first character: \"o*ooo*o*o*o\" → first is o. So (4,0).\n\nRow 5: \"**o*o*o***o\" → first two are **, so (5,0) is *, impassable. So can't go down to row 5, column 0. Therefore, from row 4, column 0, can't go further down. So perhaps at row 4, column 0, need to move in another direction.\n\nSo from (4,0), possible directions: up (back), down (blocked), left (out of bounds?), right. So maybe move right. Let me think. But perhaps there's a better way. Let me try to outline.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving right first from (0,0) to (0,1), (0,2)... but there may be walls later. Let me check row 0 is all o's. So moving right along row 0 to column 10? But then, perhaps from there, moving down. However, the problem is that maybe there are walls in the lower rows that block that approach.\n\nBut let me think again. Let's try to proceed step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's try to move down first. Let me track the path.\n\nStart: (0,0)\n\nMove down to (1,0). Then down to (2,0). Down to (3,0). Down to (4,0). Now, can't go down to (5,0) because that's a *.\n\nSo from (4,0), need to move right. Let's go right to (4,1). What is row 4, column 1? Row 4 is \"o*ooo*o*o*o\". Let me parse row 4: o * o o o * o * o * o ?\n\nWait, original input for row 4 is \"o*ooo*o*o*o\". Let's split into each character:\n\nRow 4: o * o o o * o * o * o ?\n\nWait, let me count. The input line is \"o*ooo*o*o*o\". Let me count the characters:\n\no * o o o * o * o * o → that's 11 characters? Let me check:\n\no (1), * (2), o (3), o (4), o (5), * (6), o (7), * (8), o (9), * (10), o (11). Yes. So row 4, column 0 is o, column 1 is *, so (4,1) is *, which is a wall. So can't move right there. So from (4,0), moving right to (4,1) is blocked. So need another direction. From (4,0), possible directions: up, right (blocked), left (invalid?), or right is blocked. Wait, maybe move up? That's going back. Maybe not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I need to backtrack. Let me think.\n\nHmm. Maybe the path down to (4,0) isn't helpful. Let me try another approach. Starting at (0,0), perhaps move right to (0,1), then down. Let me try that.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Move right to (0,1). Then down to (1,1). What's row 1, column 1? Row 1's line is \"o*o*****o**\". Let me parse it. First character is o (col 0), then * (col 1). So (1,1) is *, a wall. So can't move down there. So from (0,1), moving down is blocked. So perhaps move right again. Let's go to (0,2). Then down to (1,2). Let's check row 1, column 2: row 1's third character. The row is \"o*o*****o**\" → first three characters are o, *, o. So (1,2) is o. So that's passable. So path so far: start → right → down.\n\nSo directions would be 'right', then 'down'. Let me track coordinates:\n\n(0,0) → right to (0,1) → right to (0,2) → down to (1,2). So directions would be ['right', 'right', 'down'].\n\nNow at (1,2). Let's see. From here, maybe continue down. Let's check row 2, column 2. Row 2 is \"o*ooooo*ooo\". Let's parse row 2. First character o (col 0), then *, then o (col 2). So (2,2) is o. So can move down. So direction down. Now at (2,2). Continue down to (3,2). Row 3, column 2: row 3 is \"o*o***o*o*o\". Let me check: col 0: o, col 1: *, col 2: o. So yes, (3,2) is o. Down again. Now at (3,2). Next down to (4,2). Row 4, column 2: row 4's third character. Row 4 is o*ooo*o*o*o. Let me split again. Let me think: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o. So (4,2) is o. Can move down. Now at (4,2). Next down to (5,2). Let's check row 5, column 2. Row 5 is \"**o*o*o***o\". Columns 0 and 1 are *, column 2 is o. So yes, (5,2) is o. So direction down again. Now at (5,2). Next down to (6,2). Row 6 is \"ooo*o*o*ooo\". Let me check row 6's column 2. Row 6 starts with ooo... so (6,0) o, (6,1) o, (6,2) o. So yes. Can move down. Now at (6,2). Next down to (7,2). Row 7 is \"**o***o***o\". Columns 0 and 1 are *, column 2 is o. So (7,2) is o. Down again. Now at (7,2). Next down to (8,2). Row 8 is \"ooooo*o*ooo\". Let me check row 8's column 2. The first five are o's, then *... so (8,2) is o. Down to (8,2). Then down to (9,2). Row 9 is \"o*o***o*o*o\". Let me check row 9's column 2. Row 9: o * o * * * o * o * o. Wait, original line for row 9 is \"o*o***o*o*o\". Let me parse:\n\no (0), * (1), o (2), * (3), * (4), * (5), o (6), * (7), o (8), * (9), o (10). So (9,2) is o. So can move down. Now at (9,2). Next down to (10,2). Let's check row 10, column 2. The row is \"o*o***o*o*X\". Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o. So (10,2) is o. Now, from here, need to get to (10,10). Let me think.\n\nCurrent position is (10,2). Need to move right through row 10. Let's check the path. Row 10's columns from 2 onwards: o (col2), then * (col3), * (col4), * (col5?), let me check again. The row is o*o***o*o*X. Let me split:\n\ncol0: o\n\ncol1: *\n\ncol2: o\n\ncol3: *\n\ncol4: *\n\ncol5: *\n\ncol6: o\n\ncol7: *\n\ncol8: o\n\ncol9: *\n\ncol10: X.\n\nSo from (10,2), moving right to (10,3) is blocked (it's *). So need another way. Hmm. So perhaps this path isn't working. Let me backtrack.\n\nAt (9,2), moving down to (10,2). From there, can't go right. So need to find another way. Let me think. Maybe from (9,2), instead of moving down, go right or left?\n\nAt (9,2), what's the surrounding? Let me check row 9. At column 2. Let me think about possible directions. From (9,2), can I move right? Let's check row 9, column 3 is *, so no. Can move up? To (8,2). Or left to (9,1) which is * (since row9's column1 is *). So only possible directions are up or left (but left is blocked). So moving up to (8,2). But that's where we came from. So perhaps this path is a dead end. So need to backtrack further.\n\nSo maybe the path down through column 2 hits a dead end. Let me think where else I could go.\n\nLet me retrace. Let's see where I was. From (7,2), moving down to (8,2), then down to (9,2), then down to (10,2). Dead end. So perhaps from (7,2), instead of going down, go right?\n\nAt (7,2), what's the possibilities? Let me check row 7. The row is \"**o***o***o\". So columns 0 and 1 are *, column 2 is o. Then columns 3,4,5 are * * * ? Let me check the original line for row 7: \"**o***o***o\". Let's split:\n\n**o***o***o → columns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: o. So from (7,2), moving right to (7,3) is blocked. So perhaps move up? Or left? Left is (7,1) which is *, so no. Up to (6,2). Which is where we came from. So maybe not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe earlier in the path, instead of going straight down column 2, there was a branch. Let me think. Let's go back to when we were at (4,2). Let me recap the path:\n\nStart → right, right → down → down → down → down → down → down → down to (4,2), then down to (5,2), (6,2), etc. Maybe at some point, instead of going straight down, there's a way to go right and find another path.\n\nLet me think. Let's take the path up to (4,2). So at (4,2). What's around here? Let me check row 4, column 2 is o. What about moving right from here? Let's check row 4, column 3. From earlier, row4 is o*ooo*o*o*o. Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: *, etc. So (4,3) is o. So from (4,2), move right to (4,3). Then perhaps proceed further right or down?\n\nSo let's try that. So from (4,2), move right to (4,3). Now, directions so far would be ... after getting to (4,2), add 'right' to the path. Now at (4,3). What's next? Let's see. From here, maybe move down? Let's check (5,3). Row 5 is \"**o*o*o***o\". Let's look at column 3. Row 5's columns: 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *? Let me check. Original row 5 is \"**o*o*o***o\". Let me split:\n\n**o*o*o***o → columns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: o. So (5,3) is *, a wall. Can't move down there. So perhaps move right again. From (4,3) to (4,4). Row4, column4 is o. Then maybe down?\n\nAt (4,4), check down to (5,4). Row5, column4 is o. So yes. So from (4,4), move down to (5,4). Now at (5,4). Let's proceed.\n\nFrom (5,4), maybe continue down. Check (6,4). Row6 is \"ooo*o*o*ooo\". Let me check column4. Row6's columns: 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, ... So (6,4) is o. So move down. Now at (6,4). Then down to (7,4). Row7, column4: row7 is \"**o***o***o\". Columns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, ... So (7,4) is *, blocked. Can't move down. So need to find another direction. From (6,4), can we move right? Let's check (6,5). Row6's column5: row6 is ooo*o*o*ooo. Let me parse again. Let me think:\n\nRow6: columns 0-2: ooo, then column3: *, column4: o, column5: *, column6: o, column7: *, then columns 8,9,10: ooo. So (6,5) is *. So can't move right. How about left? From (6,4), left to (6,3) which is * (since row6, column3 is *). So no. Up to (5,4). Or move right to (6,5) is blocked. So maybe move up? From (6,4) up to (5,4). Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternative path: From (5,4), instead of moving down, move right? Let's see. (5,4) is column4. Let me check row5's columns. At (5,4) is o. Moving right to (5,5): row5's column5 is *, blocked. How about left? From (5,4) to (5,3) is *, blocked. So maybe up? To (4,4). Then what? From (4,4), maybe move right again. Let's think. From (4,4), right to (4,5) is *, so no. So perhaps this path isn't working. Let me backtrack again.\n\nBack to (4,4). From there, moving down to (5,4) led to a dead end. Maybe from (4,4), move right to (4,5)? No, that's *.\n\nAlternative idea: From (4,3), instead of going down, move right again. From (4,3) to (4,4) is o. Then to (4,5) which is *? No. So stuck again. Hmm.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Maybe from (4,2), instead of going right, go up? Let me check. From (4,2), up to (3,2). Which we had earlier. Then perhaps from there, move right?\n\nEarlier, at (3,2), we went down. Now, from (3,2), move right to (3,3). Let me check row3's column3. Row3 is \"o*o***o*o*o\". Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, etc. So (3,3) is *, blocked. Can't move there. How about moving up from (3,2) to (2,2)? No, that's where we came from. Or move right to (3, something else?\n\nAlternatively, from (3,2), move right to (3,3) is blocked. So maybe from (3,2), move up again? Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better path. Let me try a different initial approach. Let's go back to the start.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let me try moving right to (0,1), then down. But earlier attempt showed that (1,1) is *.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,0), move right to (0,1), then right to (0,2), then down to (1,2) as before. Then from there, maybe instead of going straight down, go right?\n\nAt (1,2), perhaps move right to (1,3). Let me check row1's column3. Row1 is \"o*o*****o**\". Let me parse it again. First three characters are o, *, o. Then columns 3-? Let me think. The row is o*o*****o**. Let me count:\n\no (0), * (1), o (2), * (3), * (4), * (5), * (6), * (7), o (8), * (9), * (10). So yes, (1,3) is *, blocked. Can't move there. So from (1,2), can't go right. So maybe move down again to (2,2), then right?\n\nAt (2,2), row2 is o*ooooo*ooo. Let me check column3: o. So from (2,2), move right to (2,3). Then proceed.\n\nSo let's try that. From (2,2), move right to (2,3). Now, directions would be ... after getting to (2,2), add 'right'. Now at (2,3). What's next? Let's see. From here, maybe move down to (3,3). Row3's column3 is *, as before. So blocked. So can't go down. How about move right to (2,4)? Row2's column4 is o. So yes. Move right to (2,4). Then down to (3,4). Let me check row3's column4. Row3 is o*o***o*o*o. Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, etc. So (3,4) is *, blocked. Can't move down. So from (2,4), move right again to (2,5). Row2's column5 is o. Then down to (3,5) which is *? Let me check row3's column5: yes, it's *.\n\nHmm. Maybe from (2,4), move up? No, that's back. Or left? Not helpful. Or move right further. Let's see. From (2,5), move right to (2,6). Row2's column6 is *? Let me check row2: \"o*ooooo*ooo\". Let me split:\n\no * o o o o o * o o o ?\n\nWait, original row2 is \"o*ooooo*ooo\". Let's count:\n\no (0), * (1), o (2), o (3), o (4), o (5), o (6), * (7), o (8), o (9), o (10). So column6 is o. So (2,6) is o. So from (2,5), move right to (2,6). Then down to (3,6). Row3's column6: row3 is o*o***o*o*o. Columns 6 is o? Let me check. Let me parse row3 again:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o. Yes, (3,6) is o. So move down to (3,6). Now at (3,6). From here, what can we do? Let's see. Maybe move down to (4,6). Row4's column6: row4 is o*ooo*o*o*o. Column6 is o. So yes. Move down. Now at (4,6). From here, perhaps move down again to (5,6). Row5's column6: row5 is \"**o*o*o***o\". Columns 6 is o. Let me check row5's columns: columns 0-2: **o, then *o*... Let me recheck. Original row5: \"**o*o*o***o\". Split into:\n\n0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: o. Yes. So (5,6) is o. Move down. Now at (5,6). From here, move down to (6,6). Row6's column6 is o. Row6 is \"ooo*o*o*ooo\". Columns 6: *, then? Let me parse row6 again: columns 0-2: ooo, column3: *, column4: o, column5: *, column6: o, column7: *, columns 8-10: ooo. Yes, (6,6) is o. Move down. Now at (6,6). From here, down to (7,6). Row7's column6: row7 is \"**o***o***o\". Columns 6 is o. Let me check: row7 is **o***o***o. Split:\n\ncolumns 0-2: **o, columns 3-5: ***, columns 6: o, columns 7-9: ***, column 10: o. Yes. So (7,6) is o. Move down. Now at (7,6). From here, down to (8,6). Row8 is \"ooooo*o*ooo\". Column6 is *? Let me check row8: \"ooooo*o*ooo\". Columns 0-4: ooooo, column5: *, column6: o, column7: *, column8: o, columns 9-10: oo. So (8,6) is o. Move down. Now at (8,6). Down to (9,6). Row9 is \"o*o***o*o*o\". Let me check column6: row9 is o*o***o*o*o. Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o. Yes, (9,6) is o. Move down to (10,6). Row10's column6: o. Now at (10,6). From here, need to reach (10,10). Let's check the path. Row10 from column6 to 10: column6 is o, column7 is *, column8 is o, column9 is *, column10 is X. So from (10,6), can move right to (10,7)? No, it's *. So how to proceed?\n\nAt (10,6), need to find a way to the right. Let me check if there's a path upwards from here. From (10,6), move up to (9,6). Then perhaps move right?\n\nAt (9,6), which is o. Let me check row9, column6 is o. From here, can we move right? Row9's column7 is *, so no. How about up to (8,6)? Or move left? Let me think. From (9,6), move up to (8,6). Then from (8,6), which is o. Let me check row8's columns. At (8,6), can I move right? Row8's column7 is *, so no. How about up to (7,6)? Where we came from. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: From (9,6), move left to (9,5)? Let me check. Row9's column5 is *. No. Or left to (9,4) which is *? Not helpful. What about up from (9,6) to (8,6), then right? No. Hmm. Maybe from (8,6), move left? Let's check. From (8,6), move left to (8,5). Row8's column5 is *, so no. Left to (8,4) which is o? Let me check row8: columns 0-4 are o's. Yes. So from (8,6), move left to (8,5) is blocked, but (8,4) is o. So perhaps from (8,6), move left twice? From (8,6) left to (8,5) is *, so no. Can't. So maybe this path is stuck.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. How did I get here? From earlier steps: starting from (0,0), moving right, down, right, down, etc., leading to (10,6). Now stuck. Need another way.\n\nLet me think about other paths. Perhaps from (7,6), instead of going down to (8,6), go right? Let me check. At (7,6), row7's column6 is o. Can I move right to (7,7)? Row7's column7 is *, so no. How about up to (6,6), then right? From (6,6), move right to (6,7) which is *? No. Or move down to (7,6) again. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: From (6,6), instead of going down to (7,6), go right? Let me check. Row6's column6 is o. Moving right to (6,7) which is *? Yes. No. So no. How about up to (5,6), then right? From (5,6), move right to (5,7) which is *? Yes. No good. Hmm.\n\nMaybe this entire path is not working. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nLet me try to look for a path that goes around the walls. Let me think about the overall structure of the maze.\n\nThe destination is at (10,10). Let me think about possible paths from there. Maybe working backwards? Let's see. From X at (10,10), the previous cell could be (10,9), but that's *; or (9,10). Let me check row9's column10: row9's line is \"o*o***o*o*o\". Column10 is o. So (9,10) is o. So from (9,10), can move down to (10,10). So if I can get to (9,10), then down to X. How to get to (9,10)?\n\nLooking at (9,10), let's see. To get there, perhaps from (9,9) which is *, no. Or (8,10). Let me check row8's column10: row8 is \"ooooo*o*ooo\". Column10 is o. So (8,10) is o. From there, move down to (9,10). So if I can get to (8,10), then down to (9,10), then down to X. How to reach (8,10)?\n\nFrom (8,10), possible previous positions could be (8,9) which is o (since row8's column9 is o?), let me check row8: \"ooooo*o*ooo\". Columns 7 is *, column8 is o, column9 is o, column10 is o. Yes. So (8,9) is o. From there, move right to (8,10). How to get to (8,9)? Let's see. Perhaps from (7,9), which is *? Let me check row7's column9. Row7 is \"**o***o***o\". Columns 7-9 are ***, so no. Or from (8,8), which is o. From (8,8), move right to (8,9). How to get to (8,8)? Let's see. From (7,8), perhaps?\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe working backward is helpful. Let me try to outline a backward path:\n\nX at (10,10) ← from (9,10) ← from (8,10) ← from (8,9) ← from (8,8) ← ... ?\n\nLet me try to find a path from start to (8,8). Let me think.\n\nLet me try to find a way to reach (8,8). Let's think of possible routes. For example, from earlier steps, I had a path that got to (4,2). Maybe from there, find a way to (8,8).\n\nLet me try to think from (4,2). Let me try a different path. From (4,2), move up to (3,2). Then right to (3,6) as before? Or maybe something else.\n\nWait, earlier I had a path that went from (2,2) → right → (2,3) → (2,4) → (2,5) → (2,6) → down to (3,6). Then down to (4,6), etc. But that led to a dead end at (10,6). Maybe from (4,6), instead of going down all the way, find another way.\n\nAt (4,6), what options are there? Let me think. From (4,6), which is row4, column6. Let me check surrounding cells. Row4 is o*ooo*o*o*o. So column6 is o. From there, can move up, down, left, or right. Let's say we're at (4,6). Let me try to move right to (4,7). Row4's column7 is *, so no. Left to (4,5), which is *. No. So can only move up or down. Down to (5,6), which we did earlier. What about up to (3,6)? Which is o. Let's say we go up to (3,6). From there, can we move right? Row3's column7 is *, so no. How about up to (2,6)? Yes, row2's column6 is o. From (2,6), move right to (2,7) which is *? No. Or move up to (1,6)? Let me check row1's column6. Row1 is o*o*****o**. Let me parse columns up to 6. First three: o*o, then columns 3-6: ****. So (1,6) is *, blocked. So from (2,6), can move up to (1,6) is blocked. So maybe move left? From (2,6) left to (2,5), which is o. Then what? From (2,5), move up to (1,5)? Let me check row1's column5: it's *. No. Or move left further to (2,4), which is o. Then up to (1,4)? Row1's column4 is *, blocked. Hmm.\n\nThis seems not helpful. Let me think of another approach. Let me try to find a path that goes around the walls on the right side.\n\nLet me think about row 0, which is all o's. Maybe go all the way right to (0,10), but then down is blocked? Let me check. At (0,10), moving down to (1,10). Let me check row1's column10: the row is \"o*o*****o**\". Column10 is *. So no. So from (0,10), down to (1,10) is blocked. How about down to (1,9)? Let me check row1's column9: it's *. So no. How about (1,8)? Row1's column8 is o? Let me parse row1 again. Original row1: o*o*****o**. Let me split into each column:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: *. So (1,8) is o. So from (0,10), move down to (1,8)? No, that would require moving diagonally, which isn't allowed. Available moves are up, down, left, right. So from (0,10), can only move left or down. Moving down to (1,10) is blocked. So perhaps move left to (0,9), then down?\n\nLet me try that. Starting from (0,0), move all the way right to (0,10). Then left to (0,9). Then down to (1,9). Let's see. (1,9) is * (row1's column9 is *). No good. So move left further to (0,8). Down to (1,8), which is o. Yes! So here's a possible path:\n\nStart at (0,0) → move right ten times to (0,10), then left once to (0,9), then down to (1,9) is blocked. Wait, (1,9) is *, so need to move left more. From (0,10), move left to (0,8), then down to (1,8). Let's see. (0,10) → left to (0,9), left to (0,8). Now down to (1,8). Row1's column8 is o. So yes. Now at (1,8). From here, maybe proceed down.\n\nLet me try this path. So from (1,8), move down to (2,8). Row2's column8 is o (row2 is o*ooooo*ooo → columns 8 is o). Yes. Down to (3,8). Row3's column8: row3 is o*o***o*o*o → column8 is o. Yes. Down to (4,8). Row4's column8: row4 is o*ooo*o*o*o → column8 is o. Yes. Down to (5,8). Row5's column8: row5 is \"**o*o*o***o\". Let me check column8. Row5's columns: 0-2: **o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: o. So (5,8) is *, blocked. Can't move down. So from (4,8), move down is blocked. What to do? From (4,8), can we move right? (4,9): row4's column9 is *, so no. Left? (4,7): row4's column7 is *, no. Up? Back to (3,8). Or move right is blocked. So need to find another way.\n\nFrom (4,8), perhaps move up to (3,8), then right? Let's see. At (3,8), which is o. Can move right to (3,9), which is *? Yes. No. Or move up to (2,8), then right? Let me think. From (3,8), move up to (2,8), then right to (2,9). Row2's column9 is o. Yes! So let's try that.\n\nSo from (3,8), up to (2,8), then right to (2,9). Now at (2,9). From here, move down to (3,9) which is *? No. Or move right to (2,10) which is o. Yes! So move right to (2,10). Now at (2,10). From here, move down to (3,10). Let me check row3's column10: it's o. Yes. Down to (3,10). Then down to (4,10). Row4's column10: o. Yes. Down to (5,10). Row5's column10: o. Yes. Down to (6,10). Row6's column10: o. Yes. Down to (7,10). Row7's column10: o. Yes. Down to (8,10). Row8's column10: o. Yes. Down to (9,10). Row9's column10: o. Yes. Then down to (10,10), which is X. Success!\n\nSo let's outline this path:\n\nStart at (0,0) → move right 10 times to (0,10), then left twice to (0,8), down to (1,8), down to (2,8), down to (3,8), up to (2,8), right to (2,9), right to (2,10), down through rows to (10,10).\n\nBut let me verify each step.\n\nLet me map this out step by step:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nMove right 10 times: from (0,0) to (0,10). That would be 10 'right' moves.\n\nThen move left twice: from (0,10) → left to (0,9) → left to (0,8). Two 'left' moves.\n\nNow at (0,8). Move down to (1,8): 'down'.\n\nNow at (1,8). Move down to (2,8): 'down'.\n\nNow at (2,8). Move down to (3,8): 'down'.\n\nNow at (3,8). Need to move up to (2,8): 'up'.\n\nThen move right to (2,9): 'right'.\n\nNow at (2,9). Move right to (2,10): 'right'.\n\nNow at (2,10). Move down to (3,10): 'down'.\n\nNow at (3,10). Move down to (4,10): 'down'.\n\nNow at (4,10). Move down to (5,10): 'down'.\n\nNow at (5,10). Move down to (6,10): 'down'.\n\nNow at (6,10). Move down to (7,10): 'down'.\n\nNow at (7,10). Move down to (8,10): 'down'.\n\nNow at (8,10). Move down to (9,10): 'down'.\n\nNow at (9,10). Move down to (10,10): 'down'.\n\nSo the directions would be:\n\n['right', 'right', ..., (10 times), 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down'].\n\nLet me count the number of moves to ensure correctness.\n\nBut let's check if all the steps are valid.\n\nLet me verify the critical parts:\n\nFrom (3,8), moving up to (2,8): valid, since (2,8) is o.\n\nFrom (2,8) to (2,9): row2's column9 is o (row2 is o*ooooo*ooo → columns 8 and 9 are o and o? Let me check row2 again: \"o*ooooo*ooo\". Let me split it:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o. Yes, columns 8 and 9 are o. So moving from (2,8) to (2,9) is valid. Then to (2,10) which is also o.\n\nFrom (2,10), down to (3,10): row3's column10 is o. Yes.\n\nThen down to (4,10): row4's column10 is o (original row4: o*ooo*o*o*o → column10 is o). Yes.\n\nDown to (5,10): row5's column10 is o. Yes.\n\nDown to (6,10): row6's column10 is o. Yes.\n\nDown to (7,10): row7's column10 is o (row7 is \"**o***o***o\" → column10 is o). Yes.\n\nDown to (8,10): row8's column10 is o. Yes.\n\nDown to (9,10): row9's column10 is o. Yes.\n\nDown to (10,10): valid.\n\nThis seems to work! So this is a valid path.\n\nNow, let's translate this into the list of directions.\n\nStarting from (0,0):\n\n- Move right 10 times to reach (0,10). So 10 'right's.\n\n- Then move left twice: 2 'left's.\n\n- Then down three times: from (0,8) to (1,8), (2,8), (3,8). So 3 'down's.\n\n- Then up once: from (3,8) back to (2,8). 'up'.\n\n- Then right twice: from (2,8) to (2,9), (2,10). 2 'right's.\n\n- Then down 8 times: from (2,10) down to (10,10). Let's count:\n\nFrom (2,10) to (3,10): 1st down.\n\n(3→4): 2nd.\n\n(4→5): 3rd.\n\n(5→6): 4th.\n\n(6→7): 5th.\n\n(7→8): 6th.\n\n(8→9): 7th.\n\n(9→10): 8th.\n\nYes, 8 'down's.\n\nSo combining all:\n\n['right'] * 10 + ['left'] * 2 + ['down'] * 3 + ['up'] + ['right'] * 2 + ['down'] * 8.\n\nLet me write this out as a list.\n\nBut let me check the exact number of steps:\n\nRight 10: 10 moves.\n\nLeft 2: 2.\n\nDown 3: 3.\n\nUp 1: 1.\n\nRight 2: 2.\n\nDown 8: 8.\n\nTotal: 10+2+3+1+2+8 = 26 moves.\n\nNow, let me make sure that each movement is valid. For example, when moving from (0,10) left twice to (0,8), that's correct. Then down three times: from (0,8) down to (1,8), (2,8), (3,8). Yes. Then up once to (2,8). Then right twice to (2,10). Then down eight times to reach (10,10).\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nSo the answer would be the list of directions as described.\n\nNow, let me write this in the required format.\n\nAnswer: ['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']\n ;Answer: ['right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','left','left','down','down','down','up','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this maze. The maze is 8x8? Let me count. The given maze has lines like \"Ioooooooo\" which is 9 characters? Wait, maybe the user made a typo. Wait, the problem says it's an n*n maze. Let me check the input again.\n\nLooking at the maze:\n\nIoooooooo (starts with I followed by 8 o's? Wait, that's 1 + 8 = 9 characters. But if it's n x n, maybe each row is n characters. Let me check all the rows:\n\nFirst line: Ioooooooo → 9 characters. Then the next lines:\n\no*******o → 9 characters. Then ooooooo*o → 9. So it's 9x9? Because there are 9 rows? Let me count the rows:\n\nThe input given is:\n\nLine 1: Ioooooooo\n\nThen 8 more lines, ending with oooooo*o*X. So total of 9 rows. Each row is 9 characters. So it's a 9x9 maze.\n\nSo the maze is 9x9. Now, I need to find a path from 'I' to 'X'.\n\nFirst, I need to represent the maze as a grid. Let me map each cell's position.\n\nLet me note down the positions. Let's index rows from 0 to 8, columns 0 to 8.\n\nStart is at (0,0), since the first cell is 'I'.\n\nDestination 'X' is at the last row. Let me check the last line: \"ooooo*o*X\". Let's parse this. The last line is row 8. Let's look at each position:\n\nPositions 0-8:\n\nAssuming the line is \"ooooo*o*X\", breaking down:\n\nIndices 0-8:\n\n0: o\n\n1: o\n\n2: o\n\n3: o\n\n4: o\n\n5: o\n\n6: * ?\n\nWait, maybe there's a typo. Let me check again. The user wrote:\n\nMaze Board:\n\nIoooooooo\n\no*******o\n\nooooooo*o\n\no***o*o*o\n\nooo*o*o*o\n\no*o***o*o\n\no*o*o*o*o\n\n**o*o*o*o\n\nooooo*o*X\n\nSo the last line is \"ooooo*o*X\". Let's count the characters. Let's see:\n\n\"ooooo*o*X\" → o (x5), then *, o, *, X? Wait, maybe it's ooooo*o*X which is 5 o's, then *, o, then * and X? Let me count:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nPositions 0: o\n\n1: o\n\n2: o\n\n3: o\n\n4: o\n\n5: * \n\n6: o \n\n7: * \n\n8: X ?\n\nYes, that's 9 characters. So the X is at (8,8). Wait, no. The last line is row 8. The X is at column 8. But in the string \"ooooo*o*X\", the last character is X. So column 8 is X. So the X is at (8,8). But let's check: the last character of the line is X. So yes.\n\nSo the start is at (0,0). The end is at (8,8).\n\nNow, the problem is to find a path from start to end, moving up, down, left, right, avoiding the walls (*).\n\nSo I need to perform some kind of pathfinding algorithm. Since the user wants the path as a list of moves, like ['up', ...], etc.\n\nBut how to approach this? Well, since it's a maze, BFS is a standard approach to find the shortest path.\n\nBut since I'm a human trying to figure it out, maybe I can visualize the maze and find a path step by step.\n\nLet me sketch the maze mentally.\n\nRow 0: I (start at 0,0) followed by o's. So row 0 is [I, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o]. So from (0,0), can move right or down.\n\nBut row 1 is o followed by 7 * then o. So row 1 is o ******* o. So row 1, columns 0 is o, columns 1-7 are *, column 8 is o. So in row 1, only columns 0 and 8 are passable.\n\nSimilarly, row 2: ooooooo*o. Let me parse row 2: assuming \"ooooooo*o\". So columns 0-6 are o, column 7 is *, column 8 is o. So row 2 has o's except column 7.\n\nSo let me try to map out possible paths.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's see possible moves.\n\nFrom (0,0), can't go up (out of bounds). Can go down (to row 1, column 0) or right (to (0,1)).\n\nBut looking at row 1, column 0 is o. So moving down to (1,0) is possible. But moving right along row 0 would take us to (0,1), (0,2), etc. But then, when trying to go down from there, row 1 has * in columns 1-7. So if I go right along row 0 to, say, (0,8), then down to row 1, column 8 is allowed (since row 1, column 8 is o). But then from there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better path is to go down first.\n\nLet me try to think of possible paths.\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\nOption 1: Move down to (1,0). From there, can we move down again to row 2, column 0? Row 2, column 0 is o. Yes. Then down to row 3, column 0? Let's check row 3: \"o***o*o*o\". So row 3, column 0 is o? Let me check:\n\nRow 3: o***o*o*o?\n\nBreaking down row 3: o at column 0, then ***, then o, * , o, * , o. So yes. So row 3, column 0 is o. So moving down from (2,0) to (3,0) is allowed. Then down to (4,0)? Let's check row 4. Row 4 is \"ooo*o*o*o\". Column 0: o? Yes. So (4,0) is o. Then down to (5,0): row 5 is \"o*o***o*o\". Column 0 is o? Yes. Then down to (6,0): row 6 is \"**o*o*o*o\". Column 0 is *? Wait row 6 starts with **. So (6,0) is *, can't go there. So from (5,0), can't go down. So perhaps from (5,0), need to move right or up?\n\nAlternatively, maybe this path hits a dead end. Let me think again.\n\nSo starting from (0,0) down to (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (4,0) → (5,0). Now, from (5,0), what's possible? Let's check row 5. The row is \"o*o***o*o\". So column 0 is o. Then column 1 is *, column 2 is o, column 3 is *, column 4 is *, column 5 is o, column 6 is *, column 7 is o. So from (5,0), possible moves: up (to (4,0)), right to (5,1) which is *, no. So can't move right. So stuck? So this path leads to a dead end. So perhaps this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative approach: from (0,0), move right to (0,1), then (0,2)... but when trying to go down, since row 1 has * in columns 1-7. So for example, from (0,8), which is the end of row 0, can go down to row 1, column 8 (which is o). So let's try that.\n\nPath: start at (0,0). Move right 8 times to (0,8). Then down to (1,8). Now, from (1,8), can we move down to row 2, column 8? Row 2's column 8 is o. Yes. So down to (2,8). Now, from (2,8), can we move left? Because row 2's column 7 is *, so can't go left through there. Let's check row 2: columns 0-6 are o, column 7 is *, column 8 is o. So from (2,8), can't go left past column 7. So maybe move down to row 3, column 8? Let's check row 3's column 8: row 3 is o***o*o*o. Column 8 is o? Let me parse row 3 again. Original line is \"o***o*o*o\". Let's index columns 0-8. Let's split:\n\no (0), *, *, *, o (4), *, o (6), *, o (8). So column 8 is o. So yes. So down to (3,8). Then down to (4,8)? Row 4's column 8: row 4 is \"ooo*o*o*o\". Let's see. Let me parse:\n\nAssuming the line is \"ooo*o*o*o\". Let's split into columns:\n\nColumns 0-2: ooo. Column 3: *, column 4: o, column 5: *, column 6: o, column 7: *, column 8: o. So yes, (4,8) is o. Down to (4,8). Then down to (5,8)? Row 5: \"o*o***o*o\". Column 8 is o? Let me check. The line is o*o***o*o. Let's split:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: o, 6: *, 7: o, 8: o? Wait the original line is \"o*o***o*o\". Let me count the characters. Let's write it as:\n\no * o * * * o * o → that's 9 characters. So column 8 is o. So yes. So (5,8) is o. Then down to (6,8). Row 6 is \"**o*o*o*o\". Let's check column 8. The line is **o*o*o*o. Columns 0-1: **, then o, etc. Let me parse column 8: the last character is o. So yes. (6,8) is o. Down to (7,8). Row 7 is \"**o*o*o*o\". Let me check column 8. The line ends with o? Let me parse: the line is **o*o*o*o. So same as before. Column 8 is o. So (7,8) is o. Down to (8,8), which is X. So that's possible. So the path would be:\n\nStart at (0,0). Move right 8 times to (0,8). Then down 8 times (from row 0 to row 8, column 8). But wait, how many downs? From (0,8) to (1,8) is down once. Then to (2,8) again, etc. Total of 8 moves down (from row 0 to 8: 8 steps). But let me check if there are walls blocking along the way.\n\nLooking at column 8 for all rows:\n\nRow 0: o (start at (0,8) is o)\n\nRow 1: o (column 8)\n\nRow 2: o (column 8)\n\nRow 3: o (column 8)\n\nRow 4: o (column 8)\n\nRow 5: o (column 8)\n\nRow 6: o (column 8)\n\nRow 7: o (column 8)\n\nRow 8: X (column 8)\n\nSo yes, all the cells along column 8 from row 0 to 8 are passable (o's). So the path is possible by moving all the way right then all the way down. But let me check if that's allowed.\n\nBut the starting point is (0,0). To get from (0,0) to (0,8), need to move right 8 times. Then from (0,8) down 8 times to (8,8). So the moves would be:\n\n['right'] * 8 + ['down'] * 8.\n\nBut let me check the maze again. For example, row 1, column 8 is o. Yes. So that's valid. So that's a possible path. But is there a shorter path? Because moving right 8 and down 8 is 16 moves. But maybe there's a shorter way.\n\nBut perhaps this is the only way? Let me think. Because looking at the maze, there are a lot of walls. For example, trying to go through the middle may be blocked. Let me see.\n\nAlternative path: starting at (0,0). Move down to (1,0). Then down to (2,0). Then down to (3,0). Then down to (4,0). Then down to (5,0). But then stuck as before. So that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: maybe go down, then right when possible. For example, from (0,0) down to (1,0). Then can we move right? At (1,0), can we move right? The row 1 is o followed by 7 * then o. So column 0 is o, columns 1-7 are *, column 8 is o. So from (1,0), can't move right until column 8. So to get from (1,0) to (1,8), need to go all the way right through columns 0 to 8, but columns 1-7 are walls. So impossible. Hence, the only way to get from (1,0) to (1,8) is to find another path, but since the columns in between are walls, can't go right. So the only way is to go back up to (0,0), then move right along row 0 to (0,8), then down to (1,8). So that seems to confirm that the initial path of going all right then down is the only way.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps there's a way through other columns. Let me check row 2. For example, row 2, column 8 is o. From there, maybe go left?\n\nBut if I take the path right then down, that's straightforward. Let me check if there's any walls in that path. For example, in column 8, row 3 is o? Yes, as discussed earlier. So yes.\n\nSo the answer would be moving right 8 times, then down 8 times. But let me verify each step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's track positions:\n\nMove right 8 times: from (0,0) to (0,1), (0,2)... up to (0,8). Then down 8 times: (1,8), (2,8)... (8,8). So the moves are indeed 8 'right's and 8 'down's. So the answer would be a list of 8 'right's followed by 8 'down's.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other way. For example, maybe there's a shorter path by snaking through some open paths. Let's look at other rows and columns.\n\nLooking at row 2: columns 0-6 are o's. So for example, from (2,6), maybe can move to row 3, column 6? Let's check row 3's column 6. Row 3 is o***o*o*o. Let me parse column 6: the line is o (0), *, *, *, o (4), *, o (6), *, o (8). So column 6 is o. So (3,6) is o. So maybe there's a way through there. But how to reach there?\n\nBut if the initial path is possible, maybe it's easier. However, the user might expect that path. But let me think again. The problem says to output a path. Any valid path is acceptable, not necessarily the shortest. However, the example shows a list of moves, so perhaps the user expects the shortest path. But since the user didn't specify, but given the example, perhaps any correct path is acceptable.\n\nBut given that the straightforward path exists, why complicate?\n\nBut let me check if there are any walls in the right-down path. For column 8, rows 0-8:\n\nRow 0, column 8: o (from the first line: I followed by 8 o's? Wait the first line is \"Ioooooooo\". Let me count. I plus 8 o's? Let me check. \"I\" followed by 8 o's would be 9 characters. Yes. So (0,0) is I, (0,1) is o, ..., (0,8) is o. So yes.\n\nThen row 1, column 8 is o (as per the second line: o*******o). Then row 2, column 8 is o. Third line: ooooooo*o. Yes. Row 3, column 8 is o. Fourth line: o***o*o*o → ends with o. Yes. Row 4, column 8 is o. Fifth line: ooo*o*o*o → column 8 is o. Row 5, column 8 is o. Sixth line: o*o***o*o → column 8 is o. Row 6, column 8 is o. Seventh line: **o*o*o*o → column 8 is o. Row 7, column 8 is o. Then row 8, column 8 is X. So yes. So the entire path is valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is to move right 8 times, then down 8 times.\n\nSo the list of moves is:\n\n['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']\n\nBut wait, moving from (0,0) to (0,8) requires 8 'right' moves (since each move is one cell). From column 0 to column 8 is 8 steps right. Then from row 0 to row 8 (column 8), it's 8 steps down (since row 0 to row 1 is one down, and row 0 to row 8 is 8 steps). So total of 8 + 8 = 16 moves.\n\nYes. So the answer would be that.\n\nBut let me check if there's another possible path. For example, maybe some zigzag path. Let's see.\n\nFor example, starting at (0,0), move down to (1,0), then down to (2,0). From there, can we move right? Let's see. Row 2, column 0 is o. Moving right along row 2, since row 2 has columns 0-6 as o. So from (2,0), move right to (2,6). Then down to row 3, column 6. Then maybe move left or something. But then how to proceed towards the end?\n\nAt (3,6), which is o. Let's see. From there, can I move down? Row 4, column 6: looking at row 4's line: ooo*o*o*o. Column 6: let's parse. Row 4 is ooo*o*o*o. Columns 0-2: ooo. Column 3: *, column 4: o, column 5: *, column 6: o, column 7: *, column 8: o. So (4,6) is o. So down to (4,6). Then maybe move right to (4,8)? But between column 6 and 8, column 7 is *, so can't go directly. Need to find another way. From (4,6), perhaps move down to (5,6). Row 5's column 6: the line is o*o***o*o. Let me parse column 6. Let's see, row 5: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: o, 6: *, 7: o, 8: o. So column 6 is *, so can't move to (5,6). So stuck. So from (4,6), can't go down. Can we go left? Or up? Or right? From (4,6), column 7 is *, so can't move right. So maybe move up to (3,6), then left? Not helpful for reaching X.\n\nSo this path seems to hit a dead end. Hence, perhaps the only valid path is the straightforward one of right then down.\n\nAnother alternative path: starting from (0,0), move down to (1,0), then right to (1,0 can't go right except to (1,8) but how? Not possible. So no.\n\nThus, the only viable path seems to be moving all the way right, then all the way down. Therefore, the answer is a list of 8 'right's and 8 'down's.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\nAnswer: ['right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down']\n ;Answer: ['right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this maze. The maze is 7x7, right? Let me first try to visualize the maze based on the given input.\n\nThe maze is given as seven lines:\n\nLine 1: Ioooooo → So first row starts with I followed by six o's? Wait, maybe each line is 7 characters. Let me check each line:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nIoooooo\no*****o\nooooo*o\no******\nooooooo\no*o****\no*ooooX\n\nLet me count each line's characters. For example, first line: I followed by 6 o's? That's 7 characters. Yes. So the maze is 7x7.\n\nLet me write down the positions of 'I' and 'X' first. The start 'I' is at position (0,0) assuming rows and columns start at 0. Wait, first row is row 0. Let's check:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o → So the start is at (0,0).\n\nLooking for X: The last line is o*ooooX. So row 6, column 6 is X. So destination is (6,6).\n\nNow I need to find a path from (0,0) to (6,6), moving up, down, left, right, through 'o's (empty spaces), avoiding 'X's (walls). Wait, the problem says 'X' is the destination. So the path must end at X. But during the path, we can't go through '*' walls.\n\nSo first, I need to model the maze as a grid. Let me sketch it out mentally.\n\nRow 0: [I, o, o, o, o, o, o]\nRow 1: [o, *, *, *, *, *, o]\nRow 2: [o, o, o, o, o, *, o]\nRow 3: [o, *, *, *, *, *, *]\nRow 4: [o, o, o, o, o, o, o]\nRow 5: [o, *, o, *, *, *, *]\nRow 6: [o, *, o, o, o, o, X]\n\nWait, let me check each row again:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: Ioooooo → I followed by oooooo (total 7)\nRow 1: o*****o → o followed by five * then o? So positions (1,0) is o, (1,1) to (1,5) are *, and (1,6) is o?\nWait, five * between o and o? Let me count. o followed by five * and then o: total 1+5+1=7. Yes. So row 1 has positions 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o.\n\nRow 2: ooooo*o → So five o's, then *, then o? Let's count: positions 0-4: o, 5: *, 6: o. So row 2 is [o, o, o, o, o, *, o].\n\nRow 3: o****** → o followed by six *? That's 7 characters. So row 3: [o, *, *, *, *, *, *]. Wait, but then how does that reach? So position (3,0) is o, and the rest are *.\n\nRow 4: ooooooo → all o's. So row 4 is all passable.\n\nRow 5: o*o**** → Let's parse: o, *, o, *, *, *, * → positions 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: *.\n\nRow 6: o*ooooX → positions 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: o, 6: X.\n\nSo now, need to find a path from (0,0) to (6,6).\n\nI think BFS (Breadth-First Search) would be a good approach here to find the shortest path. But since the user just wants any valid path (probably the shortest?), I can simulate that.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a small grid, maybe I can figure it out manually.\n\nLet me try to plan the path step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let me think about possible directions.\n\nFrom (0,0), possible moves: down (to (1,0)), or right (to (0,1))? Let's check if those positions are passable.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 0. Let's check possible moves.\n\nRight: (0,1) is 'o', so allowed. Down: (1,0) is 'o' as per row 1, column 0. So both options are possible.\n\nBut looking ahead, maybe some paths are blocked. Let me try to find a way.\n\nLet me try to see possible routes.\n\nFirst, note that row 1 has a lot of walls. For example, from row 1, columns 1-5 are walls. So from (1,0), can only move to positions where adjacent cells are not walls.\n\nLet me try to outline possible paths.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let me try moving down first.\n\nPath attempt 1:\n\nStart at (0,0). Move down to (1,0). From there, can't move left (out of bounds), can't move up (back to start). Let's check possible directions: down, right, left?\n\nAt (1,0), down to (2,0) which is 'o' (row 2, column 0 is o). So moving down to (2,0).\n\nFrom (2,0), can we move down again? (3,0) is o (row 3, column 0). So yes. So move down to (3,0).\n\nNow at (3,0). From here, can we go down? Row 4, column 0 is o. So yes. Move down to (4,0).\n\nFrom (4,0), can move down to (5,0) which is o. Then down to (6,0) which is o. Now at (6,0), need to get to (6,6). But row 6 has a wall at column 1. So from (6,0), can move right to (6,1)? But (6,1) is '*' (wall). So no. Wait, (6,0) is o. So current position is (6,0). Let me check row 6:\n\nRow 6 is [o, *, o, o, o, o, X]. So (6,0) is o. From here, can move right to (6,1) which is *, which is blocked. So can't. So maybe move up?\n\nFrom (6,0), up would be (5,0). Let's check (5,0): row 5, column 0 is o. So yes. So moving up to (5,0). From there, can we move right? (5,1) is * (row 5, column 1 is *). So no. So maybe move up again to (4,0). But that's going back. Not helpful.\n\nThis path seems stuck. Let me backtrack. So maybe moving down to row 6 is not helpful. Let's try other directions.\n\nBack to when we were at (4,0). Instead of moving down to (5,0), maybe move right? From (4,0), can we go right? Let's see. Row 4 is all o's. So moving right from (4,0) to (4,1), (4,2), etc. Maybe that's a better approach.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nStarting from (0,0). Move down to (1,0), then down to (2,0), down to (3,0), down to (4,0). Now at (4,0). Let's move right along row 4. From (4,0) to (4,1), (4,2)... up to maybe (4,6). But then from there, how to get to (6,6)?\n\nBut row 5 and 6 have some walls. Let's see. Suppose I go all the way right to (4,6). Then from there, can I move down? (5,6) is * (row 5, column 6 is *). Can't. Move up? Already at row 4. So maybe move up to row 3? (3,6) is * (row 3 is all o followed by *s? Wait row 3 is o******. So row 3, column 0 is o, columns 1-6 are *.\n\nSo (3,0) is o, others are *. So from (4,0), moving up to (3,0) is allowed, but can't go further right. So maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe from row 4, move right to some column where we can go down.\n\nFor example, from (4,0), move right to (4,2). Let me think. Let's say we go from (4,0) to (4,2). Then, can we move down? Let's check row 5, column 2. Row 5's columns: 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, etc. So (5,2) is o. So yes. So from (4,2), move down to (5,2). Then from there, can we move down to (6,2)? Let's check row 6, column 2: it's o. Yes. Then from (6,2), need to get to (6,6). From (6,2), move right through columns 3,4,5,6. Since row 6 columns 2 is o, 3 is o, 4 o, 5 o, 6 X. So yes. So path would be:\n\n(0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → down to (3,0) → down to (4,0) → right to (4,2) → down to (5,2) → down to (6,2) → right, right, right, right to (6,6).\n\nLet me check if that's possible. Let's outline the steps:\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\ndown (to row 1,0)\n\ndown (row 2,0)\n\ndown (row 3,0)\n\ndown (row 4,0)\n\nright, right (to 4,2)\n\ndown (row 5,2)\n\ndown (row 6,2)\n\nright, right, right, right (to 6,6). That's four moves right? From 2 to 6 is 4 steps? 6-2=4 steps. Yes.\n\nSo the moves would be:\n\ndown, down, down, down, right, right, down, down, right, right, right, right.\n\nBut need to check if each step is valid. Let me confirm each position:\n\n(0,0) → down to (1,0): valid.\n\n(1,0) → down to (2,0): valid.\n\n(2,0) → down to (3,0): valid.\n\n(3,0) → down to (4,0): valid.\n\n(4,0) → right to (4,1): o (row 4 is all o's). Then right to (4,2): o. Valid.\n\nThen down to (5,2): which is o. Valid.\n\nThen down to (6,2): o. Valid.\n\nFrom there, right to (6,3): o. Then (6,4): o, (6,5): o, then (6,6): X. So yes.\n\nSo the path would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path. Maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternative approach: Starting from (0,0), moving right first. Let's see.\n\nFrom (0,0), move right to (0,1). Then maybe proceed. But row 0 is all o's. Let's see if there's a way to go down earlier.\n\nFor example, from (0,0) → right, right, right, etc. to reach a position where you can go down.\n\nBut looking at row 0, if I go all the way to (0,6), but then can't go down because row 1, column 6 is o. Let me check:\n\nAt (0,6): move down to (1,6), which is o. Then from there, maybe proceed.\n\nSo path:\n\n(0,0) → right 6 times to (0,6). Then down to (1,6). From there, can we go down? (1,6) is o. Next row is row 2, column 6: o (row 2, column 6 is o). So down to (2,6). Then row 3, column 6 is * (row 3 is o followed by six *? Wait row 3 is o******. So column 0 is o, columns 1-6 are *? Wait, row 3 has 7 characters. So o followed by six *? That would make column 6 a *.\n\nSo at (2,6), moving down to (3,6) is * which is blocked. So can't go that way. So this path is stuck. So maybe from (1,6), move left? Let's see.\n\nFrom (1,6), can move left to (1,5) which is * (blocked). Or down to (2,6) which is allowed (o?), but then from (2,6), can move down to (3,6) which is *, blocked. So maybe from (2,6) move left? Let's see row 2. Row 2 is ooooo*o. So columns 0-4 are o, column 5 is *, column 6 is o. So from (2,6), can move left to (2,5) which is * (blocked). So no. Or up to (1,6), or down to (3,6) blocked. So stuck. So that path isn't helpful. So maybe moving right initially isn't the best approach.\n\nBack to the first path I found. Let me check again. It works. Let me count the steps:\n\ndown four times (from 0→1→2→3→4), then right twice (to 4,2), then down twice (to 6,2), then right four times (to 6,6). Total steps: 4+2+2+4=12 steps. Is there a shorter path?\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe go right and down in a way to bypass some walls.\n\nFor example, starting at (0,0), move right to (0,1), then down to (1,1) which is * (blocked). No. Can't. So maybe from (0,0) move right to (0,1), then down isn't possible. So maybe move further right until a position where down is possible.\n\nFor example, from (0,0) move right to (0, 5?), but let me check. Let's think.\n\nRow 0 is all o's. So from (0,0), moving right to (0, 5). Then down to (1,5) which is * (blocked). No. So not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe go down to row 0→1→2→3→4, then right to column 2, then down as before. Which is the first path.\n\nAnother possibility: From row 4, column 0, maybe move right to column 6, then down? But earlier attempt showed that from (4,6), down to (5,6) is blocked. But what about moving left from (4,6) to some column?\n\nAlternatively, from row 4, column 0, move right to (4, 2) as before. Then down to (5,2), then right?\n\nAt (5,2), can we move right? Let's check. Row 5: columns 2 is o. Column 3 is *, so blocked. So can't move right from (5,2) to (5,3). So must move up or down. Down to (6,2) as before. Then proceed.\n\nAnother possible path: Maybe from row 4, column 0, move right to (4, 0) to (4, 6) but that's not helpful. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: Let me try to find the path step by step using BFS logic.\n\nLet me represent the grid with coordinates (row, column).\n\nStart at (0,0). Mark visited.\n\nPossible directions: up, down, left, right. But for each step, need to check if the next cell is within bounds, not a wall, and not visited.\n\nLet me try to simulate BFS.\n\nInitialize a queue with (0,0). Keep track of the path.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, maybe I can find the shortest path.\n\nLet me consider possible paths.\n\nFrom (0,0), possible first steps: down to (1,0) or right to (0,1).\n\nLet me explore down first.\n\nPath 1: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (4,0) → (4,1) → (4,2) → (5,2) → (6,2) → (6,3) → (6,4) → (6,5) → (6,6). That's the path I thought earlier. Let's check the steps:\n\nFrom (4,0), moving right to (4,1), then to (4,2). Then down to (5,2), down to (6,2). Then right four times.\n\nAnother possible way: Maybe from (4,0), go down to (5,0) then right?\n\nLet me check. From (4,0), down to (5,0). (5,0) is o. Then from (5,0), can move right to (5,1)? No, it's *. So can't. Or up back to (4,0). Not helpful. Or right to (5,0) can't. So maybe from (5,0), move right to column 2? No, because (5,1) is *, blocked. So no. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternative path from (4,0): move right to (4,1), then down? Let's see. (4,1) is o. Down to (5,1) is * → blocked. So no. So must move further right.\n\nFrom (4,0) → right to (4,1), then right to (4,2). Down to (5,2) is allowed. Then down to (6,2). Then right.\n\nAnother idea: From (4,2), can we move up? Like to (3,2)? But row 3, column 2 is *? Let me check row 3. Row 3 is o followed by six *s. So (3, 0) is o, columns 1-6 are *s. So (3,2) is * → blocked. So can't go up from (4,2) to (3,2).\n\nSo the earlier path seems valid.\n\nAnother possible path: Starting from (0,0), go right to (0,1), then down to (1,1) which is blocked. Not possible. So maybe go further right. From (0,0) → right to (0,1) → right to (0,2) → down to (1,2)? Let's check. Row 1, column 2 is * → blocked. Can't. So need to find a way down where possible.\n\nFor example, from (0, 5): down to (1,5) which is * → blocked. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. So maybe the first path is the only viable one.\n\nAnother possibility: From row 0, go right to (0, 5), then down? No. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,0) move down to (1,0), then right? Can't because (1,1) is *.\n\nSo from (1,0), can only move down or left (but left is out of bounds). So down to (2,0).\n\nSo the first path is probably the correct way.\n\nSo the moves would be:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nMove down four times to reach (4, 0).\n\nThen move right twice to (4,2).\n\nThen down to (5,2).\n\nThen down to (6,2).\n\nThen move right four times to reach (6,6).\n\nSo the sequence of moves is:\n\ndown, down, down, down, right, right, down, down, right, right, right, right.\n\nLet me count the steps:\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\n1. down → (1,0)\n2. down → (2,0)\n3. down → (3,0)\n4. down → (4,0)\n5. right → (4,1)\n6. right → (4,2)\n7. down → (5,2)\n8. down → (6,2)\n9. right → (6,3)\n10. right → (6,4)\n11. right → (6,5)\n12. right → (6,6)\n\nYes, 12 steps. Let me make sure that all these positions are valid.\n\nCheck each position:\n\n(0,0): start.\n\n(1,0): o (row 1, column 0).\n\n(2,0): o (row 2, column 0).\n\n(3,0): o (row 3, column 0).\n\n(4,0): o (row 4, column 0).\n\n(4,1): o (row 4 is all o).\n\n(4,2): o.\n\n(5,2): row 5, column 2 is o (as per row 5: o*o**** → [o, *, o, *, *, *, *]).\n\nYes, (5,2) is o.\n\n(6,2): row 6, column 2 is o (row 6: o*ooooX → [o, *, o, o, o, o, X]).\n\nThen moving right from (6,2) to (6,3): o, then (6,4): o, (6,5): o, then (6,6): X. All valid.\n\nSo this path works. Now, I need to represent this as a list of moves. Each step is a direction.\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): down.\n\nFrom (1,0) to (2,0): down.\n\nSimilarly, three more downs. Then right, right, etc.\n\nSo the list of moves would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nIs there any other possible path? Let me think. For example, maybe a path that goes up? Not sure. Let me check.\n\nAnother possible path: Suppose from row 4, column 0, instead of going right to column 2, maybe go right further and find another way.\n\nBut row 4 is all o's. Let's say from (4,0), go right all the way to (4,6). Then from there, down to (5,6) is blocked. But from (4,6), can we move up? Well, already in row 4. Maybe move left. But how?\n\nAlternatively, from (4,6), move left to (4,5). Then down? Let's check. (4,5) is o. Down to (5,5) which is * (row 5, column 5 is *). So blocked.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,6), move left to (4, 5), then left to (4,4), then down?\n\n(4,4) is o. Down to (5,4) which is * (row 5's column 4 is *). No. So that's blocked.\n\nSo no, that path doesn't help.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe from row 4, column 0, move right to (4, 2), then right to (4, 3)... but row 4 is all o's. Let's see. From (4, 3), can we go down? Row 5, column 3 is * → blocked. So no. So must stay in row 4 until column 2.\n\nSo the original path is the correct way.\n\nAnother alternative path: Maybe from (3,0), instead of going down to (4,0), go right? But row 3, column 0 is o, and columns 1-6 are *s. So can't move right. So no.\n\nThus, the first path seems correct.\n\nNow, the answer should be a list of moves. Let me make sure that each move is correctly represented.\n\nFor example, from (0,0) to (1,0): down. Then again down, etc. Then right twice, then down twice, then right four times. So the list is as I wrote before.\n\nBut let me check for any possible errors. For example, when moving from (4,0) to (4,1), that's a right move. Then to (4,2) another right. Then down to (5,2) (down). Then down to (6,2) (down again). Then four rights.\n\nYes. So the moves are correct.\n\nSo the final answer is the list of these moves.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','down','down','right','right','down','down','right','right','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this maze. The maze is 11x11, right? Let me start by visualizing the maze based on the given input.\n\nFirst, I'll try to map out the positions. The first line is \"Ioooooooooo\", so the starting point is at (0,0) assuming rows are 0-indexed. The destination 'X' is at the last row, which is row 10, and looking at the last line \"**o***o****\" followed by \"ooo*ooooooX\"—wait, the last line is actually the 11th line? Let me count again. The user provided 11 lines, each with 11 characters. Let me check each line:\n\nMaze Board lines:\n\nLine 0: Ioooooooooo → starts with I, then 9 o's, then maybe a typo? Wait, each line should be 11 characters. Let me count:\n\n\"I\" followed by 10 o's? Wait, \"Ioooooooooo\" has 1 (I) + 9 o's = 10 characters. Oh, maybe there's a typo. But the user probably intended each line to be 11 characters. Let me check each line again.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check each line's length:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nLine 0: Ioooooooooo → Let's count the letters. I followed by 10 o's? Let me count: I o o o o o o o o o o → 1 + 9? No, 1 + 10 would be 11. Wait, \"Ioooooooooo\" — how many o's? Let me see:\n\n\"I\" + \"oooooooooo\"—the \"o\" repeated 10 times? So yes, 11 characters. So line 0 is row 0, columns 0-10. The start is at (0,0). The end is in line 10 (assuming 0-based index) of the maze. Let me check the last line:\n\nThe last line provided is \"ooo*ooooooX\". Let's count the characters. o o o * o o o o o o X → that's 11 characters. So yes, the X is at column 10 of row 10. So destination is (10,10).\n\nNow, the task is to find a path from (0,0) to (10,10), moving up, down, left, right, avoiding the walls (*). \n\nI need to figure out a path. Let me try to sketch the maze mentally or perhaps note down positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps perform a BFS (Breadth-First Search) approach to find the shortest path.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, let me try to trace a possible path.\n\nLet me start at (0,0). The starting position is (row, column) (0,0). Let me note that in the first row, the rest are o's except maybe the first cell. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: I (0,0) followed by o's up to column 10. So from (0,0), can move right to (0,1), or down to (1,0).\n\nBut need to find a path. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me try to outline the maze structure.\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o o o o o → all passable except the starting point.\n\nRow 1: o * * * * * o * o * * → Wait the second line is \"o*****o*o**\". Let me parse that correctly. Let's split each line into characters.\n\nLet me re-express the maze with each row:\n\nRow 0: ['I', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o']\n\nRow 1: ['o', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', 'o', '*', 'o', '*', '*']\n\nRow 2: ['o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', '*', 'o', '*', 'o', 'o', 'o']\n\nRow 3: ['o', '*', 'o', '*', 'o', '*****o'? Wait original line is \"o*o*o*****o\". Let me parse row 3 as:\n\nRow3: o * o * o * * * * * o ?\n\nLet me write each character:\n\nRow3: ['o', '*', 'o', '*', 'o', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', 'o'] ?\n\nWait original line is \"o*o*o*****o\". Let me count:\n\nCharacters: o * o * o * * * * * o → yes, 11 characters. So positions (3,0) is o, (3,1)*, (3,2)o, etc.\n\nSimilarly for other rows. This is going to be complex. Maybe I need to find a path step by step.\n\nLet me try to find a path.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's consider possible directions. From (0,0), can move down to (1,0) or right to (0,1). Let's check if those positions are passable.\n\nRow 1, column 0 is 'o', so passable. So moving down to (1,0). Alternatively, moving right to (0,1) which is 'o' as well. Let's see which path leads to the exit.\n\nLet me try moving down first. Let's try:\n\nStart at (0,0). Move down to (1,0). Now at (1,0). What's next?\n\nFrom (1,0), can we move down to (2,0)? Row 2, column 0 is 'o' (row 2 is \"ooooo*o*ooo\" → first character is o). So yes. So move down to (2,0).\n\nFrom (2,0), can we move down again? (3,0) is 'o' (row 3 starts with 'o'). So move down to (3,0).\n\nFrom (3,0), can we move down again to (4,0)? Let's check row 4's first character. The fourth line (assuming rows start at 0) is row 4: \"o*o*ooooo*o\". First character is o. So yes. So down to (4,0).\n\nContinue down to (5,0)? Row 5: \"o*o*o*o*o*o\" → first character is o. Down again. Then (5,0). Then down to (6,0), same pattern. Then (7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (10,0). Wait, but let me check each row's first character:\n\nRow 0: I\nRow 1: o\nRow 2: o\nRow 3: o\nRow 4: o\nRow 5: o\nRow 6: o\nRow 7: o\nRow 8: o\nRow 9: * (since the line is \"**o***o****\" → first two are *, then o... so row 9, column 0 is *? Wait row 9 is \"**o***o****\". Let me parse row 9:\n\nRow 9: columns 0-10:\n\n0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: * ?\n\nSo row 9, column 0 is *, which is a wall. So when moving down from row 8 (which is row 8: o*o*o*o*ooo → first character is o. So from (8,0), moving down to (9,0) would hit a wall. So that path is blocked. Therefore, moving straight down from (0,0) would hit a dead end at row 8,0. So that approach won't work. So perhaps need to find another way.\n\nAlternative approach: from (0,0), move right. Let's try that.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Move right to (0,1). Then maybe proceed further right? Let's see. But perhaps need to find a way around the walls.\n\nBut maybe combining right and down movements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the path needs to go around the walls. Let me try to think of BFS steps.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can find a path.\n\nAnother idea: since the end is at (10,10), maybe the path needs to move towards the bottom-right.\n\nLooking at the maze, perhaps there's a corridor along the left side, but row 9 blocks it. So maybe need to find another way.\n\nLet me try to outline possible paths.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's try moving right to (0,1), then down to (1,1). But row 1, column 1 is * (from row 1: o followed by five *s). So row 1, column 1 is *, which is a wall. So can't move down from (0,1) to (1,1). So perhaps from (0,1) can move right again. Let's see. From (0,0) moving right to (0,1), then right again to (0,2), etc., until we find a way down.\n\nLet me check row 0: all o's except the first cell. So moving all the way right along row 0 to (0,10)? But then how to get down? Let's see. From (0,10), can we move down? Let's check row 1, column 10: row 1 is \"o*****o*o**\" → column 10 is * (the line ends with **). So (1,10) is * (wall). So maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps move down from row 0 at some column where the next row is passable.\n\nFor example, starting at (0,0), move right to (0,1), then down to (1,1) is blocked. Let's try moving further right. Let's say from (0,0) move right to (0,6). Let me check row 0, column 6 is o. Then down to row 1, column 6. Row 1, column 6 is o (row 1's 7th character, since index starts at 0. The row is o followed by 5 * then o, etc. Let me recheck row 1:\n\nRow 1: \"o*****o*o**\" → breaking into indexes 0-10:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: *\n\n3: *\n\n4: *\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: *\n\nSo yes, at (1,6) is o. So if I can get to (0,6), then down to (1,6). Let me see how to get there. From (0,0) moving right 6 steps to (0,6). Then down to (1,6). Then perhaps proceed further.\n\nSo path so far: right 6 times, then down. But let's think of the steps as moves. Each right is a 'right' command. So from start, 6 'right's, then a 'down'.\n\nBut maybe there's a shorter path, but for now let's try this.\n\nOnce at (1,6), what next? Let's see. From there, can move down to (2,6). Row 2, column 6: looking at row 2's line: \"ooooo*o*ooo\". Let's parse:\n\nRow 2: indexes 0-10:\n\n0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: o, 6: *, 7: o, 8: *, 9: o, 10: o.\n\nSo (2,6) is *, a wall. Can't go down. So from (1,6), can we move right or left or up?\n\nUp would take us back to (0,6). Left would take us along row 1. Let's see. From (1,6), can we move left? Let's check. For example, moving left to (1,5). But row 1, column 5 is * (from earlier). So no. So perhaps move right from (1,6) to (1,7)? But row 1, column 7 is *, which is blocked. So no. So from (1,6), options are up, or right (blocked), left (blocked), down (blocked). So dead end. Therefore, moving to (0,6) and down is a dead end.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps find another column in row 0 where moving down is possible. Let's look for positions in row 0 where row 1 has an 'o'.\n\nLooking at row 1's columns:\n\nAt column 0: o (so from row 0, column 0 can go down to row 1, 0).\n\nColumns 1-5: *, column 6: o, column 8: o, others are *.\n\nSo in row 0, columns where row 1 is o are column 0, 6, and 8.\n\nSo perhaps from row 0, column 8. Let me check. So from (0,0), moving right 8 times to (0,8). Then down to (1,8). Let's check row 1, column 8: from earlier, row 1's column 8 is o. Yes. So that's possible.\n\nSo path: right 8 times, then down.\n\nNow at (1,8). Let's see what's next. From here, can move down to (2,8). Let's check row 2's column 8: row 2 is \"ooooo*o*ooo\". At column 8: *, since row 2's 8th index is * (as per earlier breakdown). So can't go down. So options are up (back), left, right, or down (blocked).\n\nFrom (1,8), moving right to (1,9) which is * (row 1's column 9 is *). Left to (1,7) which is * (row 1's column 7 is *). So stuck again. Dead end.\n\nHmm. So columns 0, 6, 8 in row 1 are o. Let me try column 0. So going down from (0,0) to (1,0). Then perhaps proceed down further?\n\nEarlier attempt to go straight down hit a problem at row 9, column 0 which is a wall. But perhaps there's a way around.\n\nSo starting at (1,0). Let's try moving down as much as possible until we hit a wall, then find another way.\n\nFrom (1,0), down to (2,0) (o), then (3,0) (o), (4,0) (o), (5,0) (o), (6,0) (o), (7,0) (o), (8,0) (o). Then row 9, column 0 is *, so can't go further down. So stuck at (8,0). Need to find another path from here.\n\nFrom (8,0), can we move right? Let's check row 8's line: \"o*o*o*o*ooo\". Let me parse row 8:\n\nRow 8: ['o', '*', 'o', '*', 'o', '*', 'o', '*', 'o', 'o', 'o'] ?\n\nYes. So column 0 is o, column 1 is *, column 2 is o, etc. So from (8,0), can move right to (8,1)? No, because column 1 is *. So can't. So from (8,0), can we move right to column 2? Let's see. From (8,0), moving right to (8,1) is blocked. So need to move up or down. Down is blocked. So move up to (7,0). But that's backtracking. Not helpful. So perhaps this path is a dead end. Hence, going straight down from start isn't helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: combine moving down and right. Let me think of another entry point.\n\nLet me consider starting by moving down to (1,0), then right when possible.\n\nAt (1,0), can we move right? Let's check. From (1,0), moving right would go through columns. Let's see, row 1's columns 0 is o, then columns 1-5 are *, column 6 is o. So from (1,0), can move right to column 0+ steps until reaching column 6? But between 0 and 6, columns 1-5 are *, so can't move directly. So need to go down first?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (1,0), move down to (2,0), then right?\n\nAt (2,0), can move right. Let's check row 2's columns. Row 2 is o's up to column 5, then * at column 6. So from (2,0), can move right along row 2 up to column 5. Let's say we go to (2,5), then down?\n\nAt (2,5), moving down to (3,5). Row 3, column 5: looking at row 3's line: \"o*o*o*****o\". Let me parse row 3:\n\nRow 3 columns 0-10:\n\n0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: o.\n\nSo column 5 is *, so can't move down. So stuck again. So perhaps from (2,5), move right to (2,5) is column 5 which is o? Wait no, row 2's column 5 is o (since row 2 is ooooo*... so columns 0-4 are o, column 5 is o? Wait earlier I thought row 2's column 5 is o? Wait row 2 is \"ooooo*o*ooo\". Let me recheck:\n\nRow 2: \"ooooo*o*ooo\". Let's split into characters:\n\nIndices 0-10:\n\n0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o.\n\nAh! So column 5 is *, not o. So earlier mistake. So from (2,0), moving right to column 4 (o), then column 5 is *, so can't go further. So from (2,4), can't move right. So perhaps move down from (2,4) to (3,4). Let's check row 3, column 4: row 3's column 4 is o. Yes, because row 3 is [o, *, o, *, o, * ...]. So yes, column 4 is o. So moving down to (3,4).\n\nNow at (3,4). What's next? From here, can move down to (4,4). Let's check row 4, column 4. Row 4 is \"o*o*ooooo*o\". Let me parse:\n\nRow 4: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o.\n\nSo column 4 is o. So moving down to (4,4). Now at (4,4). From here, can move down to (5,4). Row 5's column 4: looking at row 5's line: \"o*o*o*o*o*o\". Let's parse:\n\nRow 5: columns alternate o and * starting with o. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, etc. So column 4 is o. So down to (5,4). Now at (5,4). Continue down to (6,4): same pattern. Row 6's column 4 is o. Down to (6,4). Then (7,4). Row 7's line is \"o*o*o*o*o**\". Let's check column 4: o (since it alternates). Then (7,4). Down to (8,4). Row 8's line: \"o*o*o*o*ooo\". Column 4: o (alternating). Down to (8,4). Now at (8,4). Let's check row 8's column 4 is o. From here, can we move down to (9,4)? Let's check row 9's column 4. Row 9 is \"**o***o****\". Let me parse:\n\nRow 9 columns:\n\n0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: *.\n\nSo column 4 is *, so can't move down. So need to move elsewhere from (8,4).\n\nFrom (8,4), can we move right or left? Let's look. Row 8's column 4 is o. Let's check surrounding cells.\n\nAt (8,4), possible directions:\n\nRight to (8,5): row 8's column 5 is * (since row 8 alternates: column 4 is o, column 5 is *). So can't move right. Left to (8,3): column 3 is o? Let me check row 8's pattern: columns alternate o, *, o, *, etc. So column 3 would be * (since column 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, etc. Wait column 4 is o, so column 3 is *? Yes. So (8,3) is *. Can't move left. So stuck? Or can move up?\n\nUp to (7,4). Which is o. But that's backtracking. Not helpful. Hmm. So this path hits a dead end.\n\nAlternative idea: from (3,4), instead of going straight down, maybe move right? Let's see. At (3,4), which is row 3, column 4. Can we move right to (3,5)? No, because row 3's column 5 is * (as per earlier). How about moving to (3,4), can we move left? No, since we came from (2,4) down. Or perhaps move up? Not helpful. So maybe from (3,4), move right to column 4+2? Let me check. For example, can we move right to column 6? Let's see. From (3,4), moving right to column 5 is blocked, then column 6? No. So no. So perhaps need to find another way from earlier steps.\n\nLet me backtrack. Earlier steps: started at (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,4) → down to (3,4). Maybe instead of going down from (2,4), go right to (2,4) is column 4 (o), then column 5 is *, so no. So maybe from (2,4), move right to column 4, then up?\n\nNot helpful. Let me think of another approach. Maybe from (2,0), instead of going to column 4, find another way. For example, from (2,0), move right to (2,2) which is o, then down?\n\nAt (2,2), moving down to (3,2). Row 3's column 2 is o. Yes. So let's try that.\n\nPath: (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,1) (but row 2's column 1 is o?), wait row 2 is ooooo*... so columns 0-4 are o, column 5 is *. So yes, can move right from (2,0) to (2,1), (2,2), etc. So let me try:\n\nFrom (2,0), move right to (2,2). Then down to (3,2). Now at (3,2), which is o. What's next?\n\nFrom (3,2), can move down to (4,2). Let's check row 4, column 2: row 4 is o*o*ooooo*o → column 2 is o. Yes. Down to (4,2). Now at (4,2). Down to (5,2). Row 5's column 2 is o (alternating pattern). Down to (5,2). Then down to (6,2): same. Down to (7,2). Row 7's column 2 is o? Let's check row 7: \"o*o*o*o*o**\". Columns alternate o, *, o, *, etc. Column 2 is o. Yes. Down to (7,2). Then (8,2): row 8's column 2 is o (since row 8 is o*o*o*...). Down to (8,2). Now at (8,2). Can we move down to (9,2)? Let's check row 9's column 2: row 9 is \"**o***o****\", column 2 is o. Yes! So down to (9,2). Now at (9,2). What's next?\n\nFrom (9,2), need to get to (10,10). Let's see. From (9,2), can we move down to (10,2)? Let's check row 10's column 2. Row 10 is \"ooo*ooooooX\". Let me parse:\n\nRow 10: columns 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, 9: o, 10: X. So column 2 is o. So yes, can move down to (10,2). Now at (10,2). From here, need to reach (10,10). Let's see what's between. From column 2 to 10, but row 10 has a * at column 3. So from (10,2), can move right to column 3? No, because it's *. So need to find a way around.\n\nHmm. So from (10,2), need to move up to bypass the * at (10,3). Let's try moving up to (9,2), then right?\n\nAt (9,2), can we move right? Let's check row 9's columns. Row 9 is **o***o****. Columns:\n\n0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: *.\n\nSo from (9,2), can move right to (9,3)? No, it's *. How about up? No, already at row 9. Or left? No. Or down to (10,2), but that's already done. So stuck?\n\nWait, maybe there's another way from earlier. Let me think. When I was at (9,2), maybe I should have gone right to (9,2) can't. What about moving up? No. Or other directions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in this path. Let me retrace.\n\nThe path so far:\n\nStart → down, down → (2,0) → right to (2,2) → down to (3,2) → down to (4,2) → down to (5,2) → down to (6,2) → down to (7,2) → down to (8,2) → down to (9,2) → down to (10,2). Now stuck at (10,2). How to get to X at (10,10)? The row 10 has a * at column 3, so from column 2, can't go right past column 3. So need to find a way to go up from (10,2), then around.\n\nLet me think. From (10,2), move up to (9,2). From there, can we move right to (9,6)? Let's check. Row 9's column 6 is o. How to get there? From (9,2), move right through columns 3 (blocked), so no. So perhaps need to move up again to row 8, column 2, then right?\n\nAt (8,2), which is part of the earlier path. From (8,2), can we move right? Let me check row 8's columns. Row 8: o*o*o*o*ooo. Columns alternate between o and *. So from column 2 (o), column 3 is *, column 4 is o, column 5 is *, column 6 is o, column 7 is *, column 8 is o, column 9 is o, column 10 is o. So from (8,2), can move right to column 4 (o), then further?\n\nLet me try. From (8,2), move right to (8,4). Which is o. Then from there, can move down to (9,4)? But row 9, column 4 is * (as before). Can't. So maybe move up? Or other directions. From (8,4), can move down to (9,4) is blocked. Or move right to (8,5) which is *? No. Left to (8,3) which is *? No. So stuck again.\n\nAlternative approach from (8,2): move up to (7,2). From there, can move right? Let's see row 7: \"o*o*o*o*o**\". Columns alternate. At (7,2) is o. From there, can move right to column 4 (o), then down?\n\nAt (7,2), move right to (7,4). Down to (8,4) which we tried earlier. Still stuck.\n\nHmm. Maybe this path isn't working. Let me think of another way. Perhaps from (3,2), instead of going straight down to (9,2), find another route.\n\nLet me backtrack to (3,2). From there, instead of going down to (4,2), maybe move right? Let's see. At (3,2), can I move right to (3,4)? No, because row 3's column 3 is *, then column 4 is o. Wait, row 3: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, etc. So from (3,2), can move right to (3,2) → (3,3) is *, so no. Can move to (3,4)? No, because (3,3) is blocked. So can't go directly. So maybe from (3,2), move up? Not helpful. Or left? No. Or down? Which we did before.\n\nAlternative idea: from (3,2), move down to (4,2), then right? At (4,2), which is o. Can we move right to (4,4)? Let's check. Row 4's columns: column 2 is o, column 3 is *, column 4 is o. So from (4,2), move right to (4,3) is blocked. Can't. So maybe move down to (5,2), then right?\n\nAt (5,2), which is o. Can move right to (5,4)? Let's see. Row 5's columns alternate. Column 2 is o, column 3 is *, column 4 is o. So from (5,2), move right to (5,4). Yes! Because from (5,2), move right two steps: (5,3) is *, so no. Wait, how to get to (5,4)? From (5,2), can we move right to (5,2) → (5,3) is *, blocked. So no. Hmm. So stuck again.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different initial approach. Let me think of another starting path.\n\nLet me try starting by moving right from (0,0) to (0,1), then down to (1,0) is not possible because of the *s. Wait, earlier attempts showed that. Let me think of a different entry point.\n\nWhat if I go from (0,0) right to (0,6), then down to (1,6), then right to (1,8)? No, because from (1,6), row 1's column 6 is o, then column 7 is *, column 8 is o. So from (1,6), can move right to (1,8)? Let me check. From (1,6), move right to (1,7) is *, blocked. Can't. So no. How about from (1,6) move down to (2,6)? Row 2, column 6 is *, so no. So stuck again.\n\nAlternative idea: find a way to reach row 2, column 6 which is *, but no. Maybe find another corridor.\n\nLet me look for possible paths from the start to the end by considering the maze's structure.\n\nThe end is at (10,10). Let's look at the last few rows.\n\nRow 10: \"ooo*ooooooX\" → columns 0-2 are o, column 3 is *, columns 4-10 are o except the last is X. So to reach X, need to get to row 10, columns 4-10. But column 3 is blocked. So how to get there? Perhaps from row 9, column 6, which is o. Let me check row 9's column 6 is o. Yes, as earlier. So if I can reach (9,6), then down to (10,6), then move right to (10,10).\n\nSo how to get to (9,6)? Let's think.\n\nFrom earlier, row 3, column 6 is o (row 3's column 6 is *? Wait row 3 is o*o*o*****o. Let me recheck: row 3's columns:\n\n0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: o.\n\nSo column 6 is *, so no. So perhaps from row 2, column 6 is *, so no. How about row 4, column 6? Row 4: \"o*o*ooooo*o\" → columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o. So column 6 is o. So if I can get to (4,6), then down to (5,6), etc., to reach (9,6)?\n\nLet me try to find a path to (4,6).\n\nHow to get to (4,6)? Let's think. From earlier steps, maybe from row 4, column 4, move right to (4,6).\n\nHow to get to (4,4)? Earlier path: from (0,0) down to (1,0), down to (2,0), right to (2,2), down to (3,2), down to (4,2). From (4,2), can move right to (4,4)? Let's see. Row 4's column 2 is o, column 3 is *, column 4 is o. So from (4,2), move right to (4,3) is blocked. Can't. So need to find another way to get to (4,6).\n\nAlternative path: from (0,0) move down to (1,0), right to (1,6), then down to (2,6) is blocked. No. Or from (0,0) move right to (0,6), down to (1,6), then down to (2,6) is *, no. How about from (0,6), move down to (1,6), then right? But row 1's column 6 is o, then column 7 is *, so can't move right. Hmm.\n\nMaybe from (1,6), move down to (2,6) is blocked, but what about moving down to (2,5)? No, row 2's column 5 is *.\n\nAlternative idea: from (1,6), move up to (0,6), then right? (0,6) is o. From (0,6), move right to (0,7), then down? Let's try.\n\nFrom (0,6), move down to (1,6) as before. From (0,6), move right to (0,7), then down to (1,7) which is * (row 1, column 7 is *). No good. How about down from (0,7) to (1,7) is blocked. So no.\n\nAlternative path: from (0,6), move down to (1,6), then right to (1,8) which is o. Wait, row 1's column 8 is o. How to get there? From (1,6), can't move right past column 7 which is *. So no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to find a different initial path.\n\nLet me try starting by moving down to (1,0), then right to (1,0) can't, but perhaps move down to (2,0), then right to (2,5) is blocked, but earlier we saw that from (2,0) to (2,4) is possible. From (2,4), down to (3,4), then right?\n\nAt (3,4), which is o. Can I move right to (3,6)? Let me see. Row 3's column 4 is o, column 5 is *, column 6 is *, so no. Can't. How about down to (4,4), then right?\n\nAt (4,4), which is o. Row 4's column 4 is o. From there, can move right to (4,5) which is o, then to (4,6) which is o. Yes! So let's try this path.\n\nLet me retrace:\n\nStart at (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,4) → down to (3,4) → down to (4,4) → right to (4,5) → right to (4,6).\n\nNow at (4,6). From here, can move down to (5,6). Let's check row 5's column 6: row 5 is alternating, so column 6 would be *? Let me calculate. Row 5: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, etc. Wait, column 4 is o, column 5 is *, column 6 is o. Yes. So (5,6) is o. Down to (5,6). Then down to (6,6): row 6's column 6 is o (same pattern). Down to (6,6). Then down to (7,6): row 7's column 6: let's see. Row 7 is \"o*o*o*o*o**\". Columns alternate. Column 6 would be o (since 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o). Yes. Down to (7,6). Then down to (8,6): row 8's column 6 is o (row 8: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *...). Yes. Down to (8,6). Now at (8,6). Can we move down to (9,6)? Let's check row 9's column 6: yes, it's o (as earlier). So down to (9,6). Now at (9,6). From here, can move down to (10,6). Row 10's column 6 is o. Yes. Now at (10,6). Now need to move right to (10,10). Let's see: row 10 from column 6 to 10 is o's except for column 3. So from (10,6), move right to (10,7), (10,8), (10,9), (10,10). All passable. So that's a valid path!\n\nLet me verify each step:\n\nStarting path:\n\n0,0 → down to 1,0 → down to 2,0 → right to 2,1 → right to 2,2 → right to 2,3 → right to 2,4 → down to 3,4 → down to 4,4 → right to 4,5 → right to 4,6 → down to 5,6 → down to 6,6 → down to 7,6 → down to 8,6 → down to 9,6 → down to 10,6 → right to 10,7 → right to 10,8 → right to 10,9 → right to 10,10 (X).\n\nNow, translating these movements into the required commands (up, down, left, right).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): down.\n\nFrom (1,0) to (2,0): down.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (2,1): right.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (2,2): right.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (2,3): right.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (2,4): right.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (3,4): down.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (4,4): down.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (4,5): right.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (4,6): right.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (5,6): down.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (6,6): down.\n\nFrom (6,6) to (7,6): down.\n\nFrom (7,6) to (8,6): down.\n\nFrom (8,6) to (9,6): down.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (10,6): down.\n\nFrom (10,6) to (10,7): right.\n\nFrom (10,7) to (10,8): right.\n\nFrom (10,8) to (10,9): right.\n\nFrom (10,9) to (10,10): right.\n\nSo the sequence of moves is:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nLet me count how many moves that is. Let's see:\n\nInitial two downs, then four rights, then down, down, two rights, then five downs (from 4,6 to 9,6 is 5 steps: 4→5, 5→6, 6→7, 7→8, 8→9, 9→10? Wait from (4,6) to (5,6) is one down, then (5,6) to (6,6) is second, then (6,6) to (7,6) third, (7,6) to (8,6) fourth, (8,6) to (9,6) fifth, and (9,6) to (10,6) sixth. Oh I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount:\n\nFrom (4,6) down to 5,6: 1 down.\n\nThen down to 6,6: 2.\n\nDown to 7,6: 3.\n\nDown to 8,6: 4.\n\nDown to 9,6: 5.\n\nDown to 10,6: 6. So that's six down moves in that segment. So the sequence would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nLet me count the number of moves:\n\n- Initial 2 downs: 2\n- 4 rights: +4 → total 6\n- 2 downs: +2 → 8\n- 2 rights: +2 → 10\n- 6 downs: +6 → 16\n- 4 rights: +4 → 20 moves total.\n\nNow, converting this into the required list of commands.\n\nBut let me make sure that each step is correct and that there are no obstacles along the way.\n\nLet me verify each segment:\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\n1. down → (1,0): valid.\n2. down → (2,0): valid.\n3. right → (2,1): valid (row 2, column 1 is o).\n4. right → (2,2): valid.\n5. right → (2,3): valid (row 2's column 3 is o).\n6. right → (2,4): valid (row 2's column 4 is o).\n7. down → (3,4): valid (row 3's column 4 is o).\n8. down → (4,4): valid (row 4's column 4 is o).\n9. right → (4,5): valid (row 4's column 5 is o).\n10. right → (4,6): valid (row 4's column 6 is o).\n11. down → (5,6): valid (row 5's column 6 is o).\n12. down → (6,6): valid (row 6's column 6 is o).\n13. down → (7,6): valid (row 7's column 6 is o).\n14. down → (8,6): valid (row 8's column 6 is o).\n15. down → (9,6): valid (row 9's column 6 is o).\n16. down → (10,6): valid (row 10's column 6 is o).\n17. right → (10,7): valid.\n18. right → (10,8): valid.\n19. right → (10,9): valid.\n20. right → (10,10): valid (X).\n\nYes, this path works! So the list of moves is as described.\n\nNow, translating this into the answer format:\n\nAnswer: ['down','down','right','right','right','right','down','down','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right']\n\nLet me count again the moves to ensure correctness.\n\nYes, the sequence is correct.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','right','right','right','right','down','down','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this maze. The maze is 7x7, right? Let me first try to visualize the maze based on the given input.\n\nThe maze is provided as:\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o\nRow 1: * * o * * * *\nRow 2: o o o o o o o\nRow 3: * * o * * * *\nRow 4: o o o o o * o\nRow 5: o * * * * * o\nRow 6: o o o o o o X\n\nSo let me write this out with coordinates. Let's assume rows are numbered 0 to 6, columns 0 to 6.\n\nStart is at (0,0). The destination is at (6,6).\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (6,6), moving only through 'o's, and not through 'X's or 'I's (except start and end). Wait, the start is 'I' and destination is 'X', so the path can start at I and end at X. The other cells are either 'o' (passable) or '*' (walls).\n\nAvailable moves are up, down, left, right. So no diagonals.\n\nLet me try to sketch the maze step by step.\n\nRow 0: I (start) is at (0,0), then o's all the way to (0,6). Wait, no. Wait the first line is \"Ioooooo\" which is I followed by six o's. So row 0 has columns 0 to 6: [I, o, o, o, o, o, o].\n\nRow 1: \"**o****\" → columns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: *.\n\nRow 2: \"ooooooo\" → all o's.\n\nRow 3: \"**o****\" same as row 1.\n\nRow 4: \"ooooo*o\" → columns 0-4: o, then *, then o at column 6.\n\nRow 5: \"o*****o\" → column 0: o, then columns 1-5: *, column 6: o.\n\nRow 6: \"ooooooX\" → all o's except last cell (6,6) is X.\n\nSo, let me try to map possible paths.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's see possible first moves. From (0,0), can I move right (to (0,1)) or down (to (1,0))? Let's check.\n\nLooking at (1,0): row 1, column 0 is a '*' (wall), so can't move down from (0,0). So the only initial move is right, to (0,1).\n\nSo from (0,0), first move is right. Let's track our position as (row, column). Let me think of BFS or DFS. Since I need to find a path, maybe BFS is better for shortest path, but since the problem doesn't specify shortest, just any path, maybe DFS with backtracking would work. Let me try to simulate.\n\nCurrent position: (0,0). Move right to (0,1). Now, from (0,1), possible moves: left (back to start, but we came from there?), right, up (invalid, since row is 0), down?\n\nLet me check (0,1). Let's consider possible directions. From here, moving down to (1,1). What's there? Row 1, column 1 is '*', so wall. Can't go there. Moving right to (0,2). Then from (0,2), possible moves. Let me try to proceed right as far as possible in row 0.\n\nRow 0 is all o's except the start (which is I, but we are already there). So moving right all the way to (0,6)?\n\nBut then from (0,6), can we go down? Let's check.\n\n(0,6) is column 6, row 0. Down would be row 1, column 6. Row 1, column 6 is '*' (from row 1: \"**o****\" → columns 0,1,3-6 are *, except column 2 is o). So row 1 column 6 is *, can't move there. From (0,6), can't move down. Also, can't move right (end of column). So from (0,6), can only move left or up (but up is out of bounds). So perhaps going all the way right isn't helpful. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: From (0,0), move right to (0,1). Then down to (1,1)? But that's a wall. No. So from (0,1), can't move down. So maybe move right again to (0,2). From there, can we move down? Let's check row 1, column 2. Row 1's column 2 is 'o', so yes. So moving down from (0,2) to (1,2).\n\nSo that's a possible step. Let's track that.\n\nPath so far: ['right', 'down'] → position (1,2).\n\nFrom (1,2), possible moves: up (back to (0,2)), right (to (1,3) which is '*'), left (back to (0,1) via (0,2)? No, left from (1,2) would be to (1,1) which is a wall. Wait, (1,2) is in row 1, column 2. Moving left would be column 1, which is '*'. So no. So from (1,2), can only move up (to (0,2)) or maybe other directions?\n\nAlternatively, from (1,2), can we move down? Let's check row 2, column 2. Row 2 is all o's. So yes. So from (1,2), moving down to (2,2). So path becomes ['right', 'down', 'down'] → position (2,2).\n\nNow at (2,2). Let's think. From here, possible directions. Let's see. Let me think of possible paths. Since row 2 is all o's, perhaps moving right or left along row 2.\n\nBut need to reach the end. Let me think of possible steps. Maybe moving right through row 2 as far as possible. Let's try.\n\nFrom (2,2), moving right to (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). Let's check if that's allowed. Since row 2 is all o's. Yes. So path would be adding 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right' (from 2 to 6 columns). Then at (2,6). From there, can we move down? Let's check row 3, column 6: which is part of row 3's \"**o****\", so column 6 is '*'. Can't. So from (2,6), can move up (already in row 2), or left, or down (blocked). Or maybe move down to row 3 column 6? No, that's a wall. So perhaps from (2,6), moving down isn't possible. Let me think if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from (2,2), moving down further. Wait, row 2 is row index 2. The maze is 7x7. So moving down from row 2 can go to row 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nBut let's think. Let me try to proceed. Let's say we are at (2,2). Let me think of possible paths. Maybe from here, moving down to row 3, column 2. Let's check row 3, column 2. It's 'o' (row 3 is \"**o****\"). So yes. So path adds 'down' → position (3,2).\n\nNow at (3,2). From here, can move up (back to (2,2)), or down to row 4, column 2. Let's check row 4, column 2. Row 4 is \"ooooo*o\" → columns 0-4 are o, column 5 is *, column 6 is o. So column 2 is o. So yes. So move down to (4,2). Path now is ['right', 'down', 'down', 'down'].\n\nAt (4,2). Now, possible directions. Let's see. From here, can we move down to row 5, column 2? Row 5 is \"o*****o\". Column 2 is in row 5: columns 1-5 are *, so column 2 is *. Can't move there. So down is blocked. Can move up to (3,2). Or left/right?\n\nMoving right from (4,2) to (4,3), (4,4), etc. Let's check. Row 4 allows up to column 4 (since column 5 is *). So columns 0-4 are o. So from (4,2), can move right to (4,3), (4,4). Let's try moving right. Let's say we go to (4,4). From there, perhaps move down? No, since row 5, column 4 is *? Let me check row 5: columns 1-5 are *, so column 4 is *. So can't. From (4,4), can move up or right (but column 5 is blocked). So maybe from (4,4), move up to row 3, column 4. Let's check row 3, column 4. Row 3 is \"**o****\" → columns 3,4,5,6 are * except column 2. So column 4 is *, so can't move there. So that's a wall. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: from (4,2), moving right to (4,3), then up? Let's see. From (4,3), up to row 3, column 3. Which is a * (row 3's column 3 is *). Can't. So maybe from (4,2), moving left? No, column is 2, left would be column 1, but that's allowed? Wait, (4,2) is in row 4, column 2. Moving left to (4,1): row 4's column 1 is o (since columns 0-4 are o). So yes. So from (4,2), moving left to (4,1). Then perhaps down? Let me check. From (4,1), down to row 5, column 1: which is * (row 5's column 1 is *). Can't. So maybe moving left again to (4,0). Then down? From (4,0) down to row 5, column 0: which is o (row 5's column 0 is o). So that's allowed. Let's try that.\n\nSo path steps:\n\nAt (4,2), move left to (4,1) → add 'left' to path.\n\nThen left again to (4,0) → add 'left'.\n\nNow at (4,0). From here, move down to (5,0). Add 'down' → position (5,0).\n\nNow at (5,0). What's next? From here, can move up (back to (4,0)), right (to (5,1) which is *), or down to (6,0). Let's check (6,0): it's o. So move down to (6,0). Add 'down' to path.\n\nNow at (6,0). Now need to get to (6,6). Since row 6 is all o's except last cell. So from (6,0), move right all the way to (6,6). That would be moving right 6 times. So path adds 'right' six times.\n\nBut let me check if that's possible. Row 6 is \"ooooooX\", so columns 0-5 are o, 6 is X. So yes, moving right from (6,0) to (6,6) requires 6 moves. So the path would be:\n\nFrom (6,0) → right to (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nSo that's 6 'right' steps.\n\nPutting it all together, let's retrace the steps:\n\nStart: (0,0)\n\nMove right → (0,1)\n\nMove down → (1,2)\n\nMove down → (2,2)\n\nMove down → (3,2)\n\nMove down → (4,2)\n\nMove left → (4,1)\n\nMove left → (4,0)\n\nMove down → (5,0)\n\nMove down → (6,0)\n\nThen move right six times to reach (6,6).\n\nLet me count the steps:\n\nOriginal path steps:\n\n['right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nWait, let me check each movement:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (0,1): right.\n\nThen down to (1,2): down.\n\nThen down to (2,2): down.\n\nThen down to (3,2): down.\n\nThen down to (4,2): down. So up to here, the moves are: right, followed by three downs? Wait initial steps:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nMove right → (0,1).\n\nThen down → (1,2): that's one down.\n\nThen down again to (2,2): second down.\n\nThen down to (3,2): third down.\n\nThen down to (4,2): fourth down. So that's four 'down's after the first 'right'.\n\nThen move left to (4,1): left.\n\nThen left again to (4,0): left.\n\nThen down to (5,0): down (fifth down? Or fifth move?)\n\nThen down to (6,0): another down (sixth down?).\n\nThen six rights.\n\nSo the list of moves would be:\n\n['right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', ...? Wait let me recount.\n\nLet me list each move step by step:\n\n1. right (from (0,0) to (0,1))\n\n2. down (from (0,1) to (1,1)? No, wait moving down from (0,1) would be row 1, column 1 which is a wall. Wait no! Wait earlier reasoning had a mistake here.\n\nWait earlier steps said that from (0,1) you can move down to (1,2). Wait how? Because (0,1) is column 1, row 0. Moving down would be to row 1, column 1. But that's a wall. Oh no! There's a mistake here. I think I made an error earlier. Let me backtrack.\n\nEarlier, I thought that from (0,1), moving down to (1,2). But that's not possible. Moving down from (row, column) is increasing the row by 1. So from (0,1), moving down is to (1,1). Which is a '*'. So that's a wall. How did I get to (1,2) earlier? That was a mistake. Oh no, I think I messed up here. Let me correct this.\n\nSo going back: after moving right from (0,0) to (0,1). From (0,1), can't move down. So how do we get to (1,2)? That's not possible. So my earlier reasoning was wrong. Let me re-examine.\n\nSo from (0,1), possible moves: right to (0,2), or up (invalid), left (back to start), or down (to (1,1) which is blocked). So the only valid move is right to (0,2).\n\nSo let's correct the steps:\n\nAfter initial 'right' to (0,1), next move is 'right' again to (0,2).\n\nFrom (0,2), can we move down? Yes. Because row 1, column 2 is 'o'. So moving down to (1,2). Ah, there we go. So the second move was right again, not down. So the steps are:\n\n1. right (to 0,1)\n\n2. right (to 0,2)\n\n3. down (to 1,2)\n\nThen from (1,2), down to (2,2), etc.\n\nSo that changes the earlier steps. Let me retrace properly.\n\nCorrected steps:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nMove 1: right → (0,1)\n\nMove 2: right → (0,2)\n\nMove 3: down → (1,2)\n\nMove 4: down → (2,2)\n\nMove 5: down → (3,2)\n\nMove 6: down → (4,2)\n\nNow at (4,2). From here, need to find a way. Earlier mistake was thinking that from (4,2) we could move left, but perhaps other options.\n\nAt (4,2), possible moves: up (to 3,2), down (to 5,2? Let's check row 5, column 2. Row 5 is \"o*****o\". Columns 1-5 are *, so column 2 is *. Can't move down. So from (4,2), can move up, left, right, or down (blocked). Let's check:\n\nLeft from (4,2) is (4,1). Is that allowed? Row 4, column 1 is o (since row 4 is ooooo*o → columns 0-4 are o). Yes. So move left to (4,1). So move 7: left.\n\nNow at (4,1). From here, can move left again to (4,0). Move 8: left.\n\nAt (4,0). From here, down to (5,0). Move 9: down.\n\nAt (5,0). Down to (6,0). Move 10: down.\n\nThen from (6,0), move right all the way to (6,6). That requires 6 moves: right six times. So moves 11-16: six 'right's.\n\nSo the total moves would be:\n\n['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nLet me count the steps again:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n1. right (from 0,0 to 0,1)\n\n2. right (0,1 to 0,2)\n\n3. down (0,2 to 1,2)\n\n4. down (1,2 to 2,2)\n\n5. down (2,2 to 3,2)\n\n6. down (3,2 to 4,2)\n\n7. left (4,2 to 4,1)\n\n8. left (4,1 to 4,0)\n\n9. down (4,0 to 5,0)\n\n10. down (5,0 to 6,0)\n\nThen six rights:\n\n11. right (6,0 → 6,1)\n\n12. right (6,1 → 6,2)\n\n13. right (6,2 → 6,3)\n\n14. right (6,3 → 6,4)\n\n15. right (6,4 → 6,5)\n\n16. right (6,5 → 6,6)\n\nSo total 16 moves. Let me check if this path is valid.\n\nLet me verify each step:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nAfter two rights, at (0,2). Down to (1,2): valid because row 1 column 2 is o.\n\nThen down to (2,2): valid (row 2 all o's).\n\nDown to (3,2): row 3 column 2 is o (row 3 is \"**o****\").\n\nDown to (4,2): row 4 column 2 is o.\n\nThen left to (4,1): o.\n\nLeft to (4,0): o.\n\nDown to (5,0): o.\n\nDown to (6,0): o.\n\nThen right to (6,6): all o's until X.\n\nYes, this seems valid.\n\nBut let me check for any possible shorter paths or alternative routes. For example, is there a way to go through row 2, all the way right, then down?\n\nLet me think. Suppose after getting to (2,2), moving right all the way to (2,6). From there, can we go down?\n\nAt (2,6), down to row 3, column 6: which is * (row 3's column 6 is *). Can't. So from (2,6), maybe move left? Let's see. From (2,6), moving down is blocked. So maybe from (2,6), move up to (1,6)? No, row 1 column 6 is *. So no. So stuck. So perhaps that path is a dead end. Hence the earlier path is better.\n\nAnother possible route: from (4,2), instead of going left twice, maybe move right? Let's see. From (4,2), moving right to (4,3), (4,4). Let's check if that leads somewhere.\n\nAt (4,2), move right to (4,3). Then right to (4,4). From (4,4), can we move down? Row 5, column 4 is * (row 5's columns 1-5 are *). So no. From (4,4), can move up to (3,4). But row 3, column 4 is * (row 3: \"**o****\", so columns 3-6 are * except column 2). So can't. From (4,4), move right to (4,5)? But row 4 column 5 is *, so blocked. So stuck here. Hence, going right from (4,2) is not helpful.\n\nAlternative idea: from (4,2), move up? No, we came from down. Wait, no, (4,2) is arrived via down steps. Moving up would take us back. Not helpful.\n\nSo the earlier path seems correct.\n\nSo the final path is:\n\n['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nLet me count the number of moves again to ensure correctness.\n\nYes, the steps are as above. Let me check if there are any other obstacles.\n\nFor example, when moving from (4,0) down to (5,0): valid. Then down to (6,0): valid. Then moving right all the way. Yes.\n\nAnother thing to check: when moving from (4,2) to (4,1) to (4,0), those are valid as row 4's columns 0-4 are o.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this path should work. Therefore, the answer should be this list of moves.\n ;Answer: ['right','right','down','down','down','down','left','left','down','down','right','right','right','right','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's tackle this maze problem. First, I need to figure out the path from the start 'I' to the destination 'X'. The maze is 12x12 based on the input lines given. Let me start by visualizing the maze.\n\nThe first line is \"Ioooooooooo*o\". So the starting point is at position (0,0). The destination 'X' is at the end of the last line. Let me note down the positions of 'I' and 'X'. \n\nFor 'I', it's the first character of the first row, so coordinates (row 0, column 0). For 'X', looking at the last line: \"ooo*ooo*o*o*X\".

Let's see:\n\nBreaking down:\n\nI (1)\n\nThen \"ooooooooo\" – that's 9 o's?\n\nThen * and o. So total 1+9+1+1= 12? Wait, but maybe I'm missing some o's. Let me recount:\n\n\"I\" followed by 9 o's? Let me write:\n\nPositions 0: I\n\nThen positions 1-10: 10 o's? Wait, maybe I need to check again. Let me take the first line as:\n\n\"Ioooooooooo*o\" – Let me split:\n\nI o o o o o o o o o * o → Let me count each character. Let's see:\n\n1. I\n2. o\n3. o\n4. o\n5. o\n6. o\n7. o\n8. o\n9. o\n10. o\n11. o\n12. *\n13. o\n\nWait, that's 13 characters. But then other lines may vary. Let me check the next line:\n\n\"o*o*o*******o\" – Let's count. Starting with o, then *, o, *, o, then ******* (7 *s?), then o. Let me count:\n\no * o * o * * * * * * * o → that's 13 characters as well. So maybe the maze is 12x12? Wait, no, because each row has 13 or 14 characters? Wait, maybe there's a typo here. Alternatively, perhaps each line is 14 characters? Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should assume that each line is of the same length. Let me take the first line as Ioooooooooo*o. Let me count the letters. Let me write it out:\n\nI followed by 9 o's? Let me count:\n\nI (1)\n\nThen oooooooooo (ten o's?), then * and o. So total 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 13? Wait:\n\nI o o o o o o o o o o * o → that's 1 + 10 + 1 + 1? Let me count each character step by step:\n\n1. I\n2. o\n3. o\n4. o\n5. o\n6. o\n7. o\n8. o\n9. o\n10. o\n11. o\n12. o\n13. *\n14. o → So 14 characters. Oh right! So each line is 14 characters. Therefore, the maze is 12 rows by 14 columns? Wait, the user said n*n maze. But the input has 12 lines. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check the number of lines provided. Let me count the lines given:\n\nThe maze board is provided as 12 lines (from \"Ioooooooooo*o\" to \"ooo*ooo*o*o*X\"). So 12 rows. But each row is 14 characters. So it's not n x n. But the user said \"an n*n maze map\". Maybe there's a typo in the input? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Well, regardless, I need to process the given maze as is.\n\nBut for solving, the key is to find the start and end positions, and then find a path through the maze.\n\nSo first, find the start (I) and end (X) positions.\n\nStart is in row 0, column 0. Let's check the first line: first character is I. So (0,0).\n\nEnd is in the last line (row 11?), let's look at the last line: \"ooo*ooo*o*o*X\". The X is at the end. Let's count the columns. Let's take that line:\n\nAssuming each line is 14 characters. Let's count:\n\no o o * o o o * o * o * X ?\n\nLet me count each character. Let's say the line is:\n\npositions 0 to 13.\n\nLet me write the line as:\n\no o o * o o o * o * o * o X ?\n\nWait, perhaps the line ends with \"*X\", so the X is at position 13. For example, the line is ...o*X. So the X is at column 13 of row 11.\n\nSo the destination is (11, 13).\n\nNow, the task is to find a path from (0,0) to (11,13), moving through 'o's (passable) and avoiding '*'.\n\nThe available moves are up, down, left, right. Each step moves one cell.\n\nNow, I need to find a valid path. Since the maze is complex, perhaps I should use a BFS (Breadth-First Search) approach to find the shortest path. But since I'm doing this manually, I need to visualize the maze and find a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to trace through the maze step by step.\n\nLet me try to outline the maze step by step.\n\nRow 0: I o o o o o o o o o * o [assuming 14 characters? Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal line: Ioooooooooo*o → Let me count the letters again. Let me write:\n\n\"I\" followed by 9 o's? Let me see:\n\n\"I\" + \"oooooooooo\" (10 o's?) + \"*\" + \"o\". So total 1+10+1+1=13? No, maybe there's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the input. But since the problem is given, I'll proceed with the assumption that each row has the same number of columns, and that the start and end positions are correctly placed.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving, perhaps I should map the maze row by row, noting the positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can proceed step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let me try to move right as much as possible, since the first row seems to have a lot of o's until the * at some position.\n\nRow 0: Let's assume that from (0,0), moving right, we can go until the * is encountered. Let me check the first line again. Assuming that after the I, there are several o's, then a *, then an o. Maybe the first row is I followed by 9 o's, then a *, then an o? That would be 1 + 9 + 1 + 1 = 12 characters. But that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the first line is I followed by 10 o's, then a *, then an o. That would be 1+10+1+1=13. So perhaps each row is 13 characters. But regardless, perhaps I need to figure out where the walls are.\n\nBut perhaps I should proceed with the following approach:\n\nStart at (0,0). From there, possible moves: right (since up is out of bounds, left is same cell, down is row 1, column 0).\n\nLet me check row 0. Let's say that from (0,0), moving right, the next cell is (0,1) which is o. So I can go right. But perhaps the path requires going down early.\n\nBut given that the maze is complex, perhaps I need to find a way through.\n\nLet me try to sketch the maze mentally.\n\nRow 0: I (start) followed by several o's until a wall. Let me imagine that in row 0, after the I, there are 10 o's, then a *, then an o. So maybe the first row allows moving right until column 10 is a wall, and column 11 is o? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a wall earlier.\n\nBut perhaps I can proceed step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let me try to move down first. Let's check row 1, column 0. The second line is \"o*o*o*******o\". So first character is o. So (1,0) is o, passable. So moving down from (0,0) to (1,0). Then, from there, can I move right? The cell (1,1) is *, which is a wall. So can't move right. So perhaps from (1,0), move down again to (2,0). Let me check row 2's first character: the third line is \"o*o*ooooo*ooo\". First character is o. So (2,0) is o. So moving down again. Then row 3, first character: fourth line is \"o*********o*o\". First character is o. So (3,0) is o. Continue down to (3,0). Next row 4: fifth line starts with o? Let me check fifth line: \"ooooooooooo*o\". Yes, first character o. So (4,0) is o. Continue down to (4,0). Row 5: sixth line is \"o***o*o***o*o\". First character o. So (5,0) is o. Continue down. Row 6: seventh line starts with o? \"ooo*o*ooo*o*o\". Yes. So (6,0) is o. Continue down. Row 7: eighth line starts with o? \"o*o*o*o***o**\". First character is o? Let me check: \"o*o*o*o***o**\". Yes, first character is o. So (7,0) is o. Continue down. Row 8: ninth line starts with o? \"o*o*o*o*o*ooo\". Yes. (8,0) is o. Continue down. Row 9: tenth line starts with o? \"o***o***o*o*o\". Yes. (9,0) is o. Continue down. Row 10: eleventh line starts with o? \"ooo*ooooo*o*o\". Yes. (10,0) is o. Continue down. Row 11: twelfth line starts with o? \"ooo*ooo*o*o*X\". Yes, first character o. So (11,0) is o. So if I keep moving down from (0,0) all the way to (11,0), but then how to get to (11,13)?\n\nBut that's probably not the right path. Because from (11,0), moving right would need to navigate through the maze. Let me think. Maybe this approach is not working. Let me try another way.\n\nAlternative approach: From (0,0), move right as much as possible. Let's see, row 0. Let me imagine that the first row allows moving right until a wall is hit. Let's say that in row 0, after the I, there are several o's. Let's assume that the first row is I followed by many o's, then a wall. For example, maybe the first row is I followed by 10 o's, then a *, then an o. So from (0,0), moving right to (0,1), (0,2)... up to (0,10) which is o, then (0,11) is *, so can't go there. So from (0,10), can't go further right. So perhaps from there, need to go down.\n\nBut how to know? Since I don't have the exact positions, perhaps I need to look at each row's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a path that moves right and down, avoiding walls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to find a path by following the rows and columns step by step.\n\nBut given that this is time-consuming, perhaps I can outline a possible path.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let me move down to (1,0). Then check row 1. Row 1's line is \"o*o*o*******o\". So row 1, column 0 is o. Then column 1 is *, column 2 is o, column 3 is *, column 4 is o, then columns 5-9 are * (since \"*******\")? Let me parse the second line:\n\n\"o*o*o*******o\" – breaking into columns:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: * \n\n6: * \n\n7: * \n\n8: * \n\n9: * \n\n10: * \n\n11: * \n\n12: o \n\nSo from (1,0), moving right to (1,2) is possible. So perhaps from (1,0), move right to (1,2). But how to get there? From (1,0), moving right to (1,1) is a wall. So can't. So maybe from (1,0), move down again to (2,0). \n\nRow 2's line is \"o*o*ooooo*ooo\". Let's parse:\n\n0: o \n\n1: * \n\n2: o \n\n3: * \n\n4: o \n\n5: o \n\n6: o \n\n7: o \n\n8: o \n\n9: * \n\n10: o \n\n11: o \n\n12: o \n\nSo from (2,0), moving down again. Let me think. Maybe from (2,0), move right to (2,2) which is o, then proceed. But perhaps I need to find a way through.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from (0,0), move right once to (0,1), then down to (1,1) which is a wall. No. So perhaps the initial steps are:\n\nStart at (0,0). Move down to (1,0). From there, move down to (2,0). Then down to (3,0), which is in a row with a lot of walls. Let me check row 3: \"o*********o*o\". So columns 0 is o, then columns 1-9 are * (assuming \"*********\"), then column 10 is o, column 11 is *, column 12 is o. So from (3,0), can't move right. So need to move down again. \n\nSo continuing down to (4,0). Row 4 is \"ooooooooooo*o\". So columns 0-11 are o's except column 12 is o? Wait, maybe the line is \"ooooooooooo*o\" which would be 12 o's followed by a * and an o? Not sure. Let me parse:\n\nAssuming the line is \"ooooooooooo*o\" – let's count the o's. Let's say there are 11 o's, then a *, then an o. So total 13 characters. Then, from (4,0), moving right all the way up to column 10 (assuming columns 0-10 are o's), then column 11 is *, column 12 is o. So from (4,0), moving right to column 12 would be possible? But how?\n\nBut perhaps row 4 is passable for a lot of columns. So from (4,0), maybe I can move right to (4,1), (4,2), etc. So perhaps from (4,0), moving right to reach a position where I can go up or down.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find a path that goes down to a certain point, then right, then up/down again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a path that starts by moving right, then down, avoiding the walls in the first rows.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nStart at (0,0). Let's move right to (0,1). Then down to (1,1), but that's a wall (row 1, column 1 is *). Can't. So from (0,1), move down to (1,1) is blocked. So perhaps from (0,1), move right again to (0,2). Then down to (1,2). Let's check row 1, column 2: it's o. So yes. So path so far is right, down.\n\nNow at (1,2). From there, can move right to (1,3) which is * (row 1, column 3 is *), so no. So move down to (2,2). Row 2, column 2 is o. Now at (2,2). From here, can move right to (2,3) which is * (row 2, column 3 is *). So no. So move down to (3,2). Row 3, column 2 is o? Let's check row 3's line: \"o*********o*o\". Column 0 is o, then columns 1 is *, column 2 is *? Or maybe row 3 is \"o*o*o*...\". Wait, original line for row 3 is \"o*********o*o\". Let me parse it again. Assuming that after the initial o, there are multiple *s. So row 3: columns 0: o, then columns 1-9 are * (since \"*********\"), then column 10 is o, column 11 is *, column 12 is o. So column 2 is *, so can't move there. So from (2,2), moving down to (3,2) is blocked by a wall. So need to find another way.\n\nSo from (2,2), maybe move left back to (2,1) which is *, no. Or move up to (1,2). From there, maybe move right to (1,4)? No, because row 1, column 3 is *, so can't move right from (1,2) to (1,3). So perhaps from (1,2), move down to (2,2) again, then move left? No, because column 1 is *.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Maybe I need to backtrack. Let me think. Perhaps the initial approach of moving down from (0,0) to (1,0), then (2,0), etc., is better.\n\nLet me try that again. Starting at (0,0). Move down to (1,0). Then down to (2,0). Then down to (3,0). But row 3, column 0 is o. Then down to (4,0), which is o. Continue down to (5,0). Row 5's line starts with o. Down to (6,0). Row 6 starts with o. Down to (7,0). Row 7 starts with o. Down to (8,0). Row 8 starts with o. Down to (9,0). Row 9 starts with o. Down to (10,0). Row 10 starts with o. Down to (11,0). Now at (11,0). Now need to move right towards the X at (11,13). Let's see what the 11th row looks like. The line is \"ooo*ooo*o*o*X\". Let me parse this row (row 11):\n\nColumns:\n\n0: o\n\n1: o\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: o\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: o\n\n11: *\n\n12: o\n\n13: X\n\nSo from (11,0), moving right to (11,1), (11,2), then hit a * at column 3. So can't proceed further right until column 3. So need to find a way to get to higher rows from earlier positions.\n\nBut since we are already at row 11, the only way is to go up. But how? Because to reach the X, we need to get to row 11, column 13. From (11,0), moving right is blocked by * at column 3. So perhaps there's a way to move up from row 11 to a higher row? No, since row 11 is the last row. So this path is a dead end. Hence, moving straight down from start is not helpful.\n\nAlternative plan: Need to find a way to move right early on to avoid getting stuck at the bottom.\n\nLet me try starting again. From (0,0), move right to (0,1), then down to (1,1) which is *, no. So move right to (0,2), then down to (1,2) which is o. Now at (1,2). From there, move right to (1,3) which is *, no. Move down to (2,2). Row 2, column 2 is o. Now at (2,2). From here, move right to (2,3) which is * (row 2's line is \"o*o*ooooo*ooo\" – columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, then columns 5-8: o's, column 9: *, etc. So yes, column 3 is *. So can't move right. So move down to (3,2). Row 3's column 2: in row 3's line \"o*********o*o\", column 0 is o, then columns 1-9 are *s. So column 2 is *, so can't move there. Dead end again. So backtrack.\n\nFrom (2,2), move up to (1,2), then move left to (1,1) is *, no. Move left to (1,0) which is o. So from (1,2), move left to (1,1) is blocked, so move left to (1,0). Then down to (2,0). Now back to (2,0). From there, maybe move right to (2,2) again? Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to find a different path. Let me try moving from (0,0) right to (0,1), then down to (1,1) is blocked. So move right to (0,2), down to (1,2). From there, move down to (2,2). From there, move down to (3,2) is blocked. So move right to (2,4)? Let me check row 2's columns. At (2,2), can I move right past the *? No. So perhaps move down to (3,2) is blocked. So perhaps from (2,2), move up to (1,2), then move right to (1,4)? Let me see. From (1,2), can I move right past the *? Row 1's columns are o*o*o*******o. So column 2 is o, column 3 is *, column 4 is o, then columns 5-9 are *s. So from (1,2), move right to (1,3) is blocked. Can't. So from (1,2), move down to (2,2). Again stuck.\n\nThis is challenging. Maybe I should try going down more from (0,0) to row 4 or so, where there might be more open space.\n\nLet me try: (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → down to (3,0) → down to (4,0). Now at (4,0). Row 4 is \"ooooooooooo*o\". So columns 0-12? Let me parse this line. Assuming it's 13 characters. Let's say it's 12 o's followed by a * and o? Or maybe 11 o's, then * then o. Regardless, from (4,0), moving right is possible. Let me try moving right from (4,0) to (4,1), (4,2), etc. Let's say I move all the way right until I hit a wall. Suppose I move right to column 10 or 11. Let's say I reach (4, 10), which is o. From there, maybe move down to row 5.\n\nRow 5's line is \"o***o*o***o*o\". Let's parse columns:\n\n0: o \n\n1: * \n\n2: * \n\n3: * \n\n4: o \n\n5: * \n\n6: o \n\n7: * \n\n8: * \n\n9: * \n\n10: o \n\n11: * \n\n12: o \n\nSo if I'm at (4,4) (assuming I moved right to there), then moving down to (5,4) which is o. From there, can move right or left.\n\nBut how to get to (4,4)? Let me think. From (4,0), moving right to (4,4) is possible if the path is clear. Assuming row 4 is all o's up to column 4. So yes. So path so far: down, down, down, down, then right four times. Now at (4,4). From there, move down to (5,4). Now at (5,4). From there, can move right to (5,5) which is *, no. Or left to (5,3) which is *, no. Or move down to (6,4). Let's check row 6: \"ooo*o*ooo*o*o\". Columns:\n\n0: o \n\n1: o \n\n2: o \n\n3: * \n\n4: o \n\n5: * \n\n6: o \n\n7: o \n\n8: o \n\n9: * \n\n10: o \n\n11: * \n\n12: o \n\nSo (6,4) is o. So moving down to (6,4). Now at (6,4). From here, can move right to (6,5) which is *, no. Or move right to (6,6) which is o. Wait, column 5 is *, so from (6,4), move right to (6,5) is blocked. Can I move up to (5,4)? No, that's where I came from. Or move down to (7,4). Let's check row 7: \"o*o*o*o***o**\". Columns:\n\n0: o \n\n1: * \n\n2: o \n\n3: * \n\n4: o \n\n5: * \n\n6: o \n\n7: * \n\n8: * \n\n9: * \n\n10: o \n\n11: * \n\n12: * \n\nSo (7,4) is o. So moving down to (7,4). Now at (7,4). From here, can move right to (7,5) which is *, no. Or move down to (8,4). Row 8's line is \"o*o*o*o*o*ooo\". Columns:\n\n0: o \n\n1: * \n\n2: o \n\n3: * \n\n4: o \n\n5: * \n\n6: o \n\n7: * \n\n8: o \n\n9: * \n\n10: o \n\n11: o \n\n12: o \n\nSo (8,4) is o. Moving down to (8,4). From there, can move right to (8,5) which is *, no. Or down to (9,4). Row 9's line is \"o***o***o*o*o\". Columns:\n\n0: o \n\n1: * \n\n2: * \n\n3: * \n\n4: o \n\n5: * \n\n6: * \n\n7: * \n\n8: o \n\n9: * \n\n10: o \n\n11: * \n\n12: o \n\nSo (9,4) is o. Moving down to (9,4). From there, can move right to (9,5) which is *, no. Or down to (10,4). Row 10's line is \"ooo*ooooo*o*o\". Columns:\n\n0: o \n\n1: o \n\n2: o \n\n3: * \n\n4: o \n\n5: o \n\n6: o \n\n7: o \n\n8: o \n\n9: * \n\n10: o \n\n11: * \n\n12: o \n\nSo (10,4) is o. Moving down to (11,4). Now at (11,4). Let's check row 11's columns: \"ooo*ooo*o*o*X\". Columns 0-2: o, column 3: *, columns 4-6: o, column 7: *, column 8: o, column 9: *, column 10: o, column 11: *, column 12: o, column 13: X. So at (11,4), which is column 4, can move right to (11,5), (11,6), then to (11,7) which is *.\n\nSo from (11,4), move right to (11,5), then (11,6), then can't go further. Need to find a way up. From (11,6), move up to (10,6). Row 10, column 6 is o. From there, move up to (9,6) which is * (row 9, column 6 is *). No. So move left? From (10,6), can move left to (10,5), o. Or right to (10,7), o. Let's say move up to (9,6) is blocked. So perhaps move left or right.\n\nFrom (10,6), move up to (9,6) is *, so no. Move down? Already at row 10. So move left or right. Let's move right to (10,7), which is o. From there, move up to (9,7) which is * (row 9, column 7 is *). No. Move right to (10,8), which is o. From there, move up to (9,8), which is o (row 9, column 8 is o). Now at (9,8). From there, can move up to (8,8). Let me check row 8: column 8 is o. Yes. So moving up to (8,8). From there, move up to (7,8). Row 7's column 8 is * (row 7: columns up to 8 are *). No. So move left to (8,7) which is *. No. Or move right to (8,9) which is *. No. So stuck again. Hmm.\n\nThis path isn't working. Maybe I need to backtrack further. Let me think.\n\nAt (10,4), I moved down to (11,4). Instead, from (10,4), maybe move right to (10,5), then down to (11,5). Then proceed further right. Let's try:\n\nFrom (10,4), move right to (10,5) (o), then down to (11,5). Now at (11,5). From there, move right to (11,6) (o), then to (11,7) which is *. Can't. So from (11,6), move up to (10,6). From there, move right to (10,7), then up to (9,7) which is *. No. Or move up to (9,6) is *, no. So again stuck.\n\nAlternative path: From (9,4), instead of moving down to (10,4), move right to (9,5) is *, no. Or move up to (8,4). Let me check row 8, column 4 is o. So from (9,4), move up to (8,4). From there, move right to (8,5) is *, no. Move up to (7,4). From there, move right to (7,5) is *, no. Move up to (6,4). From there, move right to (6,5) is *, no. Move up to (5,4). From there, move right to (5,5) is *, no. Move up to (4,4). From there, move right to (4,5) is o (assuming row 4 is all o's up to column 10). So move right to (4,5), then down to (5,5) which is *, no. Not helpful.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to find a different route earlier on.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's look at the destination at (11,13). To get there, perhaps I need to reach row 11 from the right side. Let's see what columns are open in row 11. From earlier parsing, row 11 has o's at columns 0-2, 4-6, 10, 12, and X at 13. So to reach X, need to be at column 12. To get to column 12 in row 11, need to come from row 10, column 12, which is o (row 10's line is \"ooo*ooooo*o*o\", column 12 is o). So from (10,12), move down to (11,12), then right to X.\n\nSo how to get to (10,12)?\n\nLooking at row 10: columns 0-2 are o, column 3 is *, columns 4-8 are o, column 9 is *, column 10 is o, column 11 is *, column 12 is o. So to get to (10,12), need to come from the left, passing through column 8 or earlier.\n\nLet me think about how to reach (10,12). Maybe from row 9, column 12? Let me check row 9: \"o***o***o*o*o\". Columns 8 is o, column 9 is *, column 10 is o, column 11 is *, column 12 is o. So (9,12) is o. From there, move down to (10,12). How to get to (9,12)? Let's see.\n\nFrom row 8, column 12? Row 8 is \"o*o*o*o*o*ooo\". Columns: 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o, 11: o, 12: o. So (8,12) is o. From there, move down to (9,12). So how to get to (8,12)? Let's see.\n\nFrom row 7, column 12? Row 7 is \"o*o*o*o***o**\". Columns: 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: o, 11: *, 12: *. So (7,10) is o, but (7,12) is *. So can't move down from there. So perhaps from (8,10) or (8,11) or (8,12). Let's think about how to reach (8,12).\n\nFrom row 8, column 10 is o, column 11 is o, column 12 is o. So if I can reach (8,10), I can move right to (8,11), then to (8,12), then down to (9,12), then down to (10,12), then to X.\n\nHow to get to (8,10)? Let's see. Row 8, column 10 is o. To get there, perhaps from row 7, column 10. Row 7, column 10 is o. From there, move down to (8,10). How to get to (7,10)? Row 7, column 10 is o. From there, maybe from row 6, column 10. Let me check row 6: \"ooo*o*ooo*o*o\". Columns: 0-2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6-8: o, 9: *, 10: o, 11: *, 12: o. So (6,10) is o. From there, move down to (7,10). How to get to (6,10)? From row 5, column 10. Row 5 is \"o***o*o***o*o\". Columns: 0: o, 1-3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7-9: *, 10: o, 11: *, 12: o. So (5,10) is o. From there, move down to (6,10). How to get to (5,10)? From row 4, column 10. Row 4 is \"ooooooooooo*o\". Assuming column 10 is o. From there, move down to (5,10). \n\nSo let's try to trace this path backward:\n\nFrom X at (11,13), need to come from (11,12). To get to (11,12), from (10,12). To get to (10,12), from (9,12). To get to (9,12), from (8,12). To get to (8,12), from (8,10) → right → right. To get to (8,10), from (7,10). To get to (7,10), from (6,10). To get to (6,10), from (5,10). To get to (5,10), from (4,10). To get to (4,10), from (4,0) moving right. \n\nNow, let's try to construct this path from the start.\n\nStart at (0,0). Move down to (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0). Now at (4,0). Move right to (4,1), (4,2), ..., up to (4,10). Then from (4,10), move down to (5,10). Then down to (6,10). Then down to (7,10). Then down to (8,10). From (8,10), move right to (8,11), then to (8,12). Then down to (9,12). Down to (10,12). Down to (11,12). Right to X at (11,13).\n\nThis seems promising. Let's verify each step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Down four times to (4,0). That would be 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down'.\n\nNow, from (4,0), need to move right 10 times to reach (4,10). Each move is 'right'. So 10 'right' moves.\n\nThen move down to (5,10): 'down'.\n\nThen down to (6,10): 'down'.\n\nThen down to (7,10): 'down'.\n\nThen down to (8,10): 'down'.\n\nNow at (8,10). Move right to (8,11): 'right'.\n\nMove right to (8,12): 'right'.\n\nThen down to (9,12): 'down'.\n\nDown to (10,12): 'down'.\n\nDown to (11,12): 'down'.\n\nThen right to (11,13): 'right'.\n\nSo the total moves would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', ..., 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right']\n\nBut let's count the exact number of 'right' moves from (4,0) to (4,10). From column 0 to 10 is 10 steps. So 10 'right' moves.\n\nLet me check if there are any walls in row 4 between columns 0 and 10. Row 4's line is \"ooooooooooo*o\". Assuming it's 12 o's followed by a * and an o? Or maybe it's 11 o's, then a *, then an o. Let me recheck: the line is \"ooooooooooo*o\". Let me count the o's. Let's say it's 11 o's, then a *, then an o. So columns 0-10 are o, column 11 is *, column 12 is o. So yes, from (4,0) to (4,10) is all o's. So 10 'right' moves.\n\nSo the moves would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', followed by 10 'right's, then 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right'].\n\nLet me count the down moves and right moves.\n\nNow, let's verify each segment:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (4,0): 4 down moves.\n\nFrom (4,0) to (4,10): 10 right moves.\n\nFrom (4,10) to (5,10): down.\n\nFrom (5,10) to (6,10): down.\n\nFrom (6,10) to (7,10): down.\n\nFrom (7,10) to (8,10): down. So that's 4 down moves here (total down moves so far: 4+4=8).\n\nFrom (8,10) to (8,12): two right moves.\n\nFrom (8,12) to (9,12): down.\n\nFrom (9,12) to (10,12): down.\n\nFrom (10,12) to (11,12): down. That's 3 down moves (total down: 8+3=11).\n\nFrom (11,12) to (11,13): right.\n\nSo the total moves are:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right' x10, 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right'].\n\nNow, let's check if each step is valid.\n\nFor example, moving from (4,10) down to (5,10): row 5, column 10 is o, as previously determined. Yes.\n\nFrom (5,10) down to (6,10): row 6, column 10 is o. Yes.\n\nFrom (6,10) down to (7,10): row 7, column 10 is o. Yes.\n\nFrom (7,10) down to (8,10): row 8, column 10 is o. Yes.\n\nFrom (8,10) right to (8,11): row 8, column 11 is o (row 8's line is \"o*o*o*o*o*ooo\", column 11 is o? Let me check row 8 again: columns are 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o, 11: o, 12: o. Yes, columns 10-12 are o. So moving right to (8,11) and (8,12) is valid.\n\nFrom (8,12) down to (9,12): row 9, column 12 is o. Yes.\n\nFrom (9,12) down to (10,12): row 10, column 12 is o. Yes.\n\nFrom (10,12) down to (11,12): row 11, column 12 is o. Yes.\n\nFrom (11,12) right to (11,13): X is there. Valid.\n\nThis seems to work! So the path is valid.\n\nNow, let's translate this into the list of moves.\n\nThe moves are:\n\n4 downs, then 10 rights, then 3 downs (to get from 4,10 to 8,10?), wait no: after the 4 downs to (4,0), then 10 rights to (4,10), then down to (5,10) (1 down), then down to (6,10) (2nd down), then down to (7,10) (3rd down), then down to (8,10) (4th down). So after the initial 4 downs, there are 4 more downs (total 4+4=8 downs so far? No, initial 4 downs, then 4 more downs. Then from (8,10), two rights, then three downs (to get to 11,12).\n\nLet me write out all the moves in order:\n\n1. down\n2. down\n3. down\n4. down\n5. right\n6. right\n7. right\n8. right\n9. right\n10. right\n11. right\n12. right\n13. right\n14. right (total 10 rights)\n15. down\n16. down\n17. down\n18. down (4 downs after the rights)\n19. right\n20. right\n21. down\n22. down\n23. down\n24. right\n\nWait, after the 10 rights, we have four downs (from row 4 to 8). Then two rights, then three downs (from row 8 to 11), then one right.\n\nLet me count again:\n\nAfter the 10 rights, we are at (4,10). Then:\n\n- down to (5,10): move 1\n- down to (6,10): move 2\n- down to (7,10): move 3\n- down to (8,10): move 4\n\nThen two rights to (8,12).\n\nThen down to (9,12): move 5\ndown to (10,12): move 6\ndown to (11,12): move 7\n\nThen right to (11,13): move 8.\n\nSo the sequence after the 10 rights is:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right'].\n\nSo the full list is:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right'].\n\nLet me count the number of each:\n\n4 downs, 10 rights, 4 downs, 2 rights, 3 downs, 1 right.\n\nTotal moves: 4 +10 +4 +2 +3 +1 = 24 moves.\n\nNow, let's verify if there are any walls along this path.\n\nFor example, when moving down from (0,0) to (4,0), each step is valid as the first column in each row is o until row 3, which is o as well.\n\nYes, rows 0-4, column 0 is o.\n\nThen moving right from (4,0) to (4,10): row 4, columns 0-10 are o, as discussed.\n\nThen down to (5,10): valid.\n\nDown to (6,10): valid.\n\nDown to (7,10): valid.\n\nDown to (8,10): valid.\n\nRight to (8,11): valid.\n\nRight to (8,12): valid.\n\nDown to (9,12): valid.\n\nDown to (10,12): valid.\n\nDown to (11,12): valid.\n\nRight to X: valid.\n\nYes, this path works!\n\nTherefore, the answer is the list of moves as described.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','right','right','down','down','down','right']"

      "Okay, let's tackle this maze problem. First, I need to understand the maze structure. The user provided an 11x11 grid (since there are 11 lines each with 11 characters). The start is 'I' and the end is 'X'. My task is to find a path from I to X, moving up, down, left, right through 'o's, avoiding ' * ' walls.\n\nFirst, I'll need to map out the maze. Let me write down the coordinates. Let's assume rows are numbered 0 to 10 (top to bottom) and columns 0 to 10 (left to right). The starting point 'I' is at the first row, first column (row 0, column 0). The destination 'X' is at the bottom right, probably row 10, column 10.\n\nLet me visualize each row:\n\nRow 0: I followed by 10 o's. So (0,0) is I, then (0,1) to (0,10) are o.\n\nRow 1: o*****o*o*o. Let's parse that. Position 0 is o, then 5 stars (so columns 1-5 are *), then o at column 6, * at 7, o at 8, * at 9, o at 10. So row 1 has walls from columns 1-5, then o at 6, etc.\n\nI think I need to find a path step by step. Maybe use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the shortest path. But since I'm doing this manually, I need to simulate the process.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's think of possible moves. From (0,0), possible directions: down (to row 1, column 0) or right (to 0,1). Let's check if those are allowed.\n\nRight: (0,1) is o, so possible. Down: row 1, column 0 is o (since row 1 starts with o). So both directions are possible. But which path leads to the exit?\n\nLet me try to sketch the path step by step. Maybe there's only one possible path. Let's try to move down first. Let's see:\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's go down to (1,0). Then check possible moves. From (1,0), can we move down again? Let's check row 2, column 0. Row 2 is \"ooooo*o*o*o\". So row 2, column 0 is o. So yes. So down again to (2,0). Then maybe down again? Row 3, column 0: row 3 starts with o? Let me check row 3: \"o***o*o****\". So first character is o. So yes. So down to (3,0). Then row 4, column 0: row 4 starts with o? Row 4 is \"o*ooo*ooooo\". First character is o. So down to (4,0). Then row 5: first character is o? Row 5: \"o*o*****o*o\" — yes. Down again. (5,0). Row 6: first character is o? Row 6 is \"o*ooooo*o*o\" — yes. Down to (6,0). Row 7: first character is *? Row 7 starts with \"**o*o******\". So (7,0) is *, so can't go down. So from (6,0), can't go down. So need to go right or up? Let's see. From (6,0), possible directions: up (back to 5,0), right (to 6,1 which is *?), looking at row 6: \"o*ooooo*o*o\". So row 6, column 0 is o, column 1 is *, so can't go right. So only up. So back to (5,0). Hmm. So maybe this path hits a dead end. Let me think if there was another way earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from the start, moving right instead of down. Let's try that. Starting at (0,0). Let's move right to (0,1). Then maybe continue right as far as possible? But need to check walls. Let's see. Row 0 is all o's except the first cell. So moving right from (0,0) to (0,1), then (0,2), etc. But perhaps there's a wall later. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining right and down moves. Let's think again. Let's try to find a path step by step.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's try to find where the 'X' is. It's at row 10, column 10. Let me check row 10: \"o*ooo*ooooX\". So the last character is X. So (10,10) is X. Let's see if there's a way to get there.\n\nLet me try to trace from the start.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's move down to (1,0). From there, can we go down again to (2,0)? Yes. Then down to (3,0). Then down to (4,0). Then down to (5,0). Then down to (6,0). Then down to (7,0)? No, because row 7, column 0 is **... so (7,0) is *, so can't go there. So from (6,0), can't go down. So backtrack. Let's think of other paths from earlier steps.\n\nPerhaps from (2,0), instead of continuing down, we can move right. Let's see. For example, when at (2,0), maybe moving right. Let's check row 2. Row 2 is \"ooooo*o*o*o\". So columns 0-4 are o, column 5 is *, then column 6 is o, column 7 is *, column 8 is o, column 9 is *, column 10 is o. So from (2,0), moving right is possible up to column 4. Let's try that. Suppose from (2,0), move right to (2,1), then (2,2), etc. Let's say we go all the way to (2,4). From there, can we go down? Let's check row 3. At column 4, row 3: row 3 is \"o***o*o****\". Let's break it down. Row 3: columns 0 is o, 1-3 are *, column 4 is o, then column 5 is *, column 6 is o, then columns 7-10 are *? So yes. So from (2,4), moving down to (3,4). Then from there, can we go down again? Row 4, column 4. Row 4 is \"o*ooo*ooooo\". Let's check. Row 4 starts with o, then * at column 1, o at 2, o at 3, o at 4. So yes, (4,4) is o. So down to (4,4). Then maybe from there, move right? Let's see. From (4,4), moving right: column 5 is *? Row 4: \"o*ooo*ooooo\". Let me parse the row:\n\nRow 4: o * o o o * o o o o o ?\n\nBreaking down each column:\n\nRow 4: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o.\n\nSo at (4,4), moving right to (4,5) is blocked by a *.\n\nSo perhaps from (4,4), move down to (5,4). Let's check row 5, column 4. Row 5 is \"o*o*****o*o\". Let's parse:\n\nRow 5: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, then columns 3-6 are *? Let me count:\n\nOriginal row: o*o*****o*o. So:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: *\n\n5: *\n\n6: *\n\n7: o\n\n8: *\n\n9: o\n\n10: *\n\nWait, maybe I need to count each character:\n\nRow 5: o * o * * * * * o * o ?\n\nLet me check the original input for row 5: \"o*o*****o*o\". Let's split into characters:\n\no * o * * * * * o * o. That's 11 characters. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: *, 7: o, 8: *, 9: o, 10: *.\n\nSo at column 4, it's * (since columns 3-6 are *). So row 5, column 4 is *, so can't move down from (4,4) to (5,4). Therefore, perhaps from (4,4), move up? Or left? Let me think.\n\nFrom (4,4), maybe move left. Let's see. Moving left from (4,4) to (4,3), then (4,2), etc. But (4,4) is in column 4. Let me check if moving left is possible. (4,3) is o (row 4, column 3 is o). So yes. So moving left to (4,3). Then maybe from there, can we go down?\n\nRow 5, column 3: row 5 column 3 is *, so no. So perhaps move left again to (4,2). Then down? Row 5, column 2 is o? Let me check row 5, column 2. Yes, row 5's column 2 is o (as per the breakdown above). So from (4,2), moving down to (5,2). Now at (5,2). Let's check from there. Possible moves.\n\nAt (5,2), can we move down? Row 6, column 2: row 6 is \"o*ooooo*o*o\". Let's parse row 6:\n\no * o o o o o * o * o ?\n\nOriginal row: \"o*ooooo*o*o\". So:\n\n0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o.\n\nSo row 6, column 2 is o. So moving down from (5,2) to (6,2). Now at (6,2). Let's see. From here, can we move further?\n\nLooking at row 6, column 2. Let's check possible directions. Up is (5,2), but we came from there. Let's see. From (6,2), moving right? Let's check row 6 columns. Column 2 is o, column 3 is o, column 4 is o, column 5 is o, column 6 is o, column 7 is *. So from (6,2), moving right to (6,3), (6,4), etc. Let's try moving right as far as possible. Let's go to (6,6) maybe. Because column 7 is *, so up to column 6. From (6,2) to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). Now at (6,6). From there, can we move down? Let's check row 7, column 6. Row 7 is \"**o*o******\". Let's parse row 7: \"**o*o******\" — columns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, then columns 5-10 are *? So row 7, column 6 is *. So can't move down. So perhaps move up? Or left? Or check other directions.\n\nFrom (6,6), moving up to row 5, column 6. Let me check row 5, column 6: earlier we saw row 5, columns 3-6 are *s. So row 5, column 6 is *, so can't move up. Hmm. What about moving left? From (6,6), maybe move left to (6,5), then (6,4)... but that's where we came from. Maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,2), maybe move down? Wait, row 7 column 2: row 7 is \"**o*o******\". Columns 0 and 1 are *, column 2 is o. So row 7, column 2 is o. So from (6,2), moving down to (7,2). Now at (7,2). Let's see. From here, can we move further?\n\nRow 7, column 2. Let's check possible directions. Let's look around. From (7,2), moving down to row 8, column 2. Row 8 is \"ooo*ooooooo\". Let me parse row 8: \"ooo*ooooooo\". So columns 0-2 are o, column 3 is *, columns 4-10 are o. So row 8, column 2 is o. So moving down to (8,2). Now at (8,2). From here, moving down to row 9, column 2. Row 9 is \"o*o***o****\". Let's parse: o * o * * * o * * * *. So row 9, column 2 is o. So moving down to (9,2). Now at (9,2). Let's check from here. Can we move down again? Row 10, column 2: row 10 is \"o*ooo*ooooX\". Let's parse: o * o o o * o o o o X. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, etc. So row 10, column 2 is o. So moving down to (10,2). Now at (10,2). From here, need to reach (10,10). Let's see. From (10,2), moving right through columns 3,4, etc. But column 5 is * (as per row 10). Let me check the path. From (10,2), moving right to 3, 4, then column 5 is blocked. So perhaps need to go up and find another path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from (9,2), there's another direction. Let me backtrack. At (9,2), perhaps moving right? Let's check. Row 9, column 2 is o. Let's see what's to the right. Row 9: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, ... So from (9,2), moving right to column 3 is blocked. So no. So from (9,2), can we move up? Let's check row 8, column 2. Yes, that's where we came from. So perhaps moving right from (8,2). At (8,2), moving right? Let me see. Row 8, column 2 is o. Row 8 is \"ooo*ooooooo\". So columns 0-2 are o, column 3 is *, columns 4-10 are o. So from (8,2), moving right to (8,3) is blocked. So no. So perhaps from (8,2), moving right up to column 2, then moving up or down?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me think if there's a better path. Maybe there's another route from earlier steps. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternative path: Starting from (0,0), move right to (0,1), then down to row 1, column 1? Wait, row 1 column 1 is * (since row 1 is o*****o*o*o). So can't go there. So from (0,1), can't go down. So from (0,1), possible directions are right or up (but up is out of bounds). So right again. So maybe move all the way right along row 0 until possible to go down.\n\nBut row 0 is all o's. So from (0,0), move right to (0,10)? No, but there might be walls in other rows that block that path. For example, if I go all the way right on row 0 to (0,10), but that's the top row. Then perhaps down from there. Let's check. (0,10) is o. Can I move down to (1,10)? Let me check row 1, column 10. Row 1 ends with o. Original row 1 is o*****o*o*o. Let's see: the last part is o*o*o. So columns 6 is o, 7 is *, 8 is o, 9 is *, 10 is o. Yes. So (1,10) is o. So from (0,10), moving down to (1,10). Then from there, can we move down again to (2,10)? Let's check row 2, column 10. Row 2 is oooo*o*o*o. Wait, original row 2 is \"ooooo*o*o*o\". Let me parse it: columns 0-4 are o, column 5 is *, column 6 is o, column 7 is *, column 8 is o, column 9 is *, column 10 is o. So yes, (2,10) is o. So moving down to (2,10). Then down to (3,10)? Let's check row 3, column 10. Row 3 is \"o***o*o****\". Columns 7 is o, then columns 7-10? Let me parse: row 3 is o***o*o****. Breaking it down:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1-3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, then columns 7-10 are *? So column 10 is *, so can't move down from (2,10) to (3,10). So stuck here. So from (2,10), need to move left or up. Let's try moving left. From (2,10), moving left to (2,9) which is *, so blocked. Can't. So perhaps move up to (1,10), then left? From (1,10), moving left. Let's see. Row 1, column 10 is o. Moving left to (1,9) which is *, blocked. So no. Hmm. This path seems stuck. Maybe there's another way.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's try to find the path from the end. Starting from X at (10,10). Let's see if we can trace backwards. From X, which is (10,10), previous cell could be (10,9), if that's o. Let me check row 10: \"o*ooo*ooooX\". Let's parse the last few columns. The last character is X. Before that, column 9 is o, column 8 is o, column 7 is o, column 6 is o, column 5 is *, column 4 is o, column 3 is o, column 2 is o, column 1 is *, column 0 is o. So (10,9) is o. So from X, the previous step could be from (10,9). Let's check if (10,9) is passable. Yes. So moving to (10,9). From there, can we move up, left, etc. Let's see. To reach (10,9), previous cell could be (10,8), or (9,9) if that's passable.\n\nLooking at row 9, column 9: row 9 is \"o*o***o****\". Let's parse columns for row 9. Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: *. So (9,9) is *, so no. So from (10,9), possible previous cell could be (9,9) if it's o, but it's not. Or (10,8). Let's check (10,8). Row 10, column 8: o. Yes. So from (10,9), previous cell is (10,8). And so on. Let's continue this backward approach.\n\nFrom X (10,10) ← (10,9) ← (10,8) ← (10,7) ← (10,6). Let's check if those are o. Row 10: columns 5 is *, so columns 6-4 are o. Yes. So (10,6) is o. From there, how to get to (10,6)? Maybe from (9,6). Let's check row 9, column 6: row 9, column 6 is o (as per earlier parsing). So from (9,6) down to (10,6). So now at (9,6). How to get to (9,6)? From (8,6), perhaps. Let's check row 8, column 6. Row 8 is \"ooo*ooooooo\". Column 3 is *, columns 4-10 are o. So (8,6) is o. So from (8,6) down to (9,6). From (8,6), how to get there? Maybe from (7,6). Let's check row 7, column 6. Row 7 is \"**o*o******\". Columns 0-1 are *, column 2 is o, column 3 is *, column 4 is o, columns 5-10 are *. So (7,4) is o. So (7,4) can move down to (8,4)? Wait, (8,4) is o. But we need to get to (8,6). So perhaps from (8,4) move right to (8,6). Let me see. Row 8, columns 4-6 are o. So yes. So path from (7,4) down to (8,4), then right to (8,6). So from there to (9,6), then down to (10,6), etc.\n\nSo how to get to (7,4)? Let's see. From (7,4), previous could be (6,4), or (7,3) if possible. Let's check. (7,4) is o. How to get there. Let's say from (6,4). Row 6, column 4: o. Yes. So from (6,4) down to (7,4). How to get to (6,4)? From earlier steps. Let's think.\n\nFrom (6,4), could come from (6,3), (6,5), (5,4), or (7,4). Let's say from (5,4). So (5,4) must be passable. Let's check row 5, column 4. Earlier analysis said row 5, column 4 is *? Wait row 5 is \"o*o*****o*o\". Let me recheck. Row 5: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: *, 7: o, 8: *, 9: o, 10: *. So column 4 is *, so (5,4) is blocked. So can't come from there. So from (6,4), must have come from up, left, or right. Let's say from (6,3). Row 6, column 3 is o. So yes. From (6,3) right to (6,4). How to get to (6,3)? Maybe from (5,3). Let's check row 5, column 3 is * (as above), so no. Or from (6,2) right to (6,3). Yes. So from (6,2) → (6,3) → (6,4) → ... So how to get to (6,2)? Earlier steps showed that from (5,2) down to (6,2). And how to get to (5,2)? From (4,2) down. And from (4,2), perhaps from (3,2) down. Let me check row 3, column 2. Row 3 is \"o***o*o****\". Columns 0 is o, then 1-3 are *, column 4 is o. So (3,2) is *, so can't come from there. So how to get to (4,2)? From (4,2), maybe from (4,1)? Row 4, column 1 is *, so no. Or from (3,2) which is blocked. Or from up, like (3,2) is blocked. Hmm. Maybe from (4,2) came from (4,3) moving left. Let's say (4,3) is o. Yes. So from (4,3) left to (4,2). How to get to (4,3)? From (3,3) which is *? No. Or from (5,3) which is *? No. Or from up, like (3,3) is *, no. Or maybe from (4,4) moving left. But how to get to (4,4)? Earlier steps said that from (2,4) down to (3,4), then down to (4,4). Let me check.\n\nLet me recap. To get to (4,3), perhaps from (4,4) moving left. If (4,4) is o, then yes. Row 4, column 4 is o. Yes. So from (4,4) move left to (4,3). How to get to (4,4)? From (3,4) down. And (3,4) is o. How to get to (3,4)? From (2,4) down. And (2,4) is o. How to get to (2,4)? From (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,4). Yes! So this seems like a viable path.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nStart at (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) → down to (3,4) → down to (4,4) → left to (4,3) → left to (4,2) → down to (5,2) → down to (6,2) → right to (6,3), (6,4) → down to (7,4) → down to (8,4) → right to (8,5), (8,6) → down to (9,6) → down to (10,6) → right to (10,7), (10,8), (10,9), (10,10).\n\nNow let's translate these movements into the required directions.\n\nLet me map each step:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): down.\n\nFrom (1,0) to (2,0): down.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (2,1): right.\n\n(2,1) to (2,2): right.\n\n(2,2) to (2,3): right.\n\n(2,3) to (2,4): right.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (3,4): down.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (4,4): down.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (4,3): left.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,2): left.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (5,2): down.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (6,2): down.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (6,3): right.\n\n(6,3) to (6,4): right.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (7,4): down.\n\nFrom (7,4) to (8,4): down.\n\nFrom (8,4) to (8,5): right.\n\n(8,5) to (8,6): right.\n\nFrom (8,6) to (9,6): down.\n\nFrom (9,6) to (10,6): down.\n\nFrom (10,6) to (10,7): right.\n\n(10,7) to (10,8): right.\n\n(10,8) to (10,9): right.\n\n(10,9) to (10,10): right.\n\nNow let's count the directions:\n\ndown, down, right, right, right, right, down, down, left, left, down, down, right, right, down, down, right, right, down, down, right, right, right, right.\n\nBut need to make sure each step is valid. Let me verify each movement:\n\nYes, each step moves one cell in the specified direction, and the path avoids walls.\n\nNow, converting this into the list of moves:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right'].\n\nWait, but let me count again. Let's list each move:\n\n1. down (from 0,0 to 1,0)\n2. down (to 2,0)\n3. right (to 2,1)\n4. right (to 2,2)\n5. right (to 2,3)\n6. right (to 2,4)\n7. down (to 3,4)\n8. down (to 4,4)\n9. left (to 4,3)\n10. left (to 4,2)\n11. down (to 5,2)\n12. down (to 6,2)\n13. right (to 6,3)\n14. right (to 6,4)\n15. down (to 7,4)\n16. down (to 8,4)\n17. right (to 8,5)\n18. right (to 8,6)\n19. down (to 9,6)\n20. down (to 10,6)\n21. right (to 10,7)\n22. right (to 10,8)\n23. right (to 10,9)\n24. right (to 10,10)\n\nYes, that's 24 moves. Let me check if there are any errors in the path.\n\nFor example, from (6,4) down to (7,4): row 7, column 4 is o? Yes, row 7 is \"**o*o******\", so column 4 is o. Then down to (8,4): row 8, column 4 is o. Yes. Then right to 8,5 and 8,6: row 8 has columns 4-10 as o, so yes. Down to 9,6: row 9, column 6 is o. Yes. Down to 10,6: yes. Then right steps: yes.\n\nThis seems correct. So the answer is a list of these moves.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','right','right','right','right','down','down','left','left','down','down','right','right','down','down','right','right','down','down','right','right','right','right']"

    "response": [
      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this maze. The maze is 8x8? Wait, let me check the input. The user provided a Maze Board with 9 lines. Wait, each line is a row. Let me count. The input given is:\n\nIoooooooo\no*o*o*o**\no*o*o*ooo\no*o***o**\no*ooo*ooo\no***o*o**\nooo*o*ooo\no*o*o*o*o\no*o*o*o*X\n\nSo that's 9 rows. Each row must be 9 characters? Let me check. The first line is \"Ioooooooo\"—that's 1 + 8 o's? Let me count: I followed by 8 o's? Wait, that's 9 characters. Yes, since 1+8=9. Each row seems to be 9 characters. So it's a 9x9 maze. So n is 9 here.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the maze. Let me try to visualize it. The starting point is 'I' at the first row, first column (assuming rows are numbered from top to bottom and columns left to right). The destination is 'X' in the last row (9th row?), but looking at the input, the last line is \"o*o*o*o*X\"—so the X is at position (9,9) if rows and columns start at 1. Let me confirm:\n\nRow 1: I o o o o o o o o\nRow 2: o * o * o * o * *\nRow 3: o * o * o * o o o\nRow 4: o * o * * * o * *\nRow 5: o * o o o * o o o\nRow 6: o * * * o * o * *\nRow 7: o o o * o * o o o\nRow 8: o * o * o * o * o\nRow 9: o * o * o * o * X\n\nYes. So the start is at (0,0) if we index from 0, or (1,1) if 1-based. Let me think in terms of coordinates. Let's use (row, column) as (y, x), starting from 0. So the start is at (0, 0). The end is at (8, 8).\n\nNow, the task is to find a path from start to end, moving only through 'o's (and the start and end points). The available moves are up, down, left, right. So no diagonals.\n\nI need to perform some kind of pathfinding algorithm. The standard approach for such mazes is BFS (breadth-first search) to find the shortest path. But since the user wants a list of moves (like directions), perhaps BFS is the way to go here.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, let me try to visualize the maze and find a path step by step.\n\nLet me sketch the maze in my mind. Let's note the positions:\n\nRow 0 (first row): I (start) followed by all o's. So from (0,0), can I move right? Let's check row 0. It's I followed by 8 o's. So row 0 is all passable except maybe nothing. So from (0,0), moving right to (0,1), (0,2), etc.\n\nBut looking at row 1 (second line): o * o * o * o ** — so positions (1,0) is 'o', (1,1) is '*', (1,2) is 'o', etc. So the maze has a checkered pattern in some rows, but with some walls.\n\nLooking at the maze, it seems that the path might need to zig-zag through the rows, avoiding the walls. Since the destination is at (8,8), perhaps there's a path that moves down and right in some pattern.\n\nLet me try to find a path manually. Let's start from (0,0). Let's think:\n\nFrom (0,0), possible moves: down (to row 1, column 0) or right (to row 0, column 1). Let's see.\n\nIf I go right first, maybe that's possible. But perhaps going down first is better. Let me try.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's go down to (1,0). Then, since row 1 has a pattern o * o * etc. So (1,0) is o. From there, can we move down again? Row 2, column 0 is 'o' (third line: starts with o). So moving down to (2,0). Then again down to (3,0) — row 3 starts with 'o'. Then down to (4,0) — row 4 starts with 'o'. Then down to (5,0) — row 5 starts with 'o'. Then down to (6,0) — row 6 starts with 'o'. Then down to (7,0) — row 7 starts with 'o'. Then down to (8,0) — which is 'o' (last row starts with o). But then from (8,0), how to reach (8,8)? The last row is o * o * o * o * X. So columns 0, 2, 4, 6 are o's, and 1,3,5,7 are *, and 8 is X. So from (8,0), need to move right through columns 0→2→4→6→8. But columns 1,3,5,7 are walls. So can't move directly. So from (8,0), moving right to (8,1) is blocked. So that path might not work. Therefore, perhaps going all the way down isn't helpful. Maybe need to combine right and down moves.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the maze. Since the start is on the top-left and the end is on the bottom-right. Maybe the path requires moving through the corridors that alternate between rows. For example, in even rows, you can move right through even columns, and in odd rows through odd columns? Not sure. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at row 0: all o's. So row 0 is passable. Row 1 has o at column 0, then *, then o at column 2, etc. So in row 1, even columns (0, 2, 4, 6) are o or o? Let me check row 1: \"o*o*o*o**\"—so columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *. So columns 0,2,4,6 are o's. So in row 1, you can move through even columns (0,2,4,6). Similarly, row 2 is \"o*o*o*ooo\"—so columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o. So in row 2, columns 0,2,4,6,7,8 are o's. So perhaps there's a path that snakes through even and odd rows by moving right or left when needed.\n\nLet me try to find a path. Let's start at (0,0). Let's move down to (1,0). From there, perhaps move right to (1,2) (since column 1 is a wall). Then down to (2,2). Then right to (2,4). Then down to (3,4). Wait, row 3 is \"o*o***o**\"—so row 3, column 4: let's see. Let me parse row 3 (third line? Wait original input is:\n\nOriginal lines:\n\nLine 1: Ioooooooo → row 0.\n\nLine 2: o*o*o*o** → row 1.\n\nLine 3: o*o*o*ooo → row 2.\n\nLine 4: o*o***o** → row 3.\n\nSo row 3 (fourth line) is o * o * * * o * *.\n\nSo columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *.\n\nSo if I'm at (2,4) (row 2, column 4), which is o. Moving down to row 3, column 4 is * (wall). Can't go there. So need to find another way. So perhaps from (2,4), can I move right? Let's see. Row 2, columns: up to column 8 are o's. So from (2,4), moving right to (2,5)? But row 2's fifth column is *? Wait row 2 is o*o*o*ooo. Let me parse that again. The string is o * o * o * o o o. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o. So column 5 is *.\n\nSo from (2,4), which is o, can move right to (2,6) (since column 5 is blocked). So moving right two steps: from 4 to 6. Then down to row 3, column 6. Row 3 column 6 is o. So that's allowed. So from (2,4) → right to (2,6) → down to (3,6). Then from there?\n\nRow 3, column 6 is o. From there, perhaps move down to row 4, column 6. Let's check row 4 (fifth line): \"o*ooo*ooo\" → columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o. So row 4, column 6 is o. So moving down to (4,6). Then maybe move right? Let's see. From (4,6), can move right to (4,7) and (4,8). So moving right, then perhaps down or up. But need to get towards the X.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,6), maybe move left? Let me think. The goal is to reach (8,8). So perhaps need to keep moving right and down.\n\nBut let's continue. From (4,6), moving right to (4,7) and then (4,8). Then down from there? Let's see. But then maybe there's a way to proceed further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (4,6), move down. Let's check row 5, column 6. Row 5 is \"o***o*o**\"—so columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *. So row 5, column 6 is o. So from (4,6) down to (5,6). Then from there, can move right? Let's see. Column 7 is * (blocked), so can't. So maybe move down again to row 6, column 6. Row 6 is \"ooo*o*ooo\"—columns 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o. So row 6, column 6 is o. From there, perhaps move right to (6,7) and (6,8). Then down to row 7, column 8? Let's see.\n\nBut let's track this path step by step. Let me try to outline the steps so far:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nDown to (1,0).\n\nRight to (1,2).\n\nDown to (2,2).\n\nRight to (2,4).\n\nRight to (2,6).\n\nDown to (3,6).\n\nDown to (4,6).\n\nDown to (5,6).\n\nDown to (6,6).\n\nFrom (6,6), moving right to (6,7), then (6,8). Then down to row 7, column 8. Then down to row 8, column 8 (which is X). But let's check if that's possible.\n\nFrom (6,6), moving right to (6,7) is allowed because row 6, column 7 is o. Then right to (6,8) (also o). Then down to (7,8). Let's check row 7's column 8. Row 7 is \"o*o*o*o*o\"—so columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o. So (7,8) is o. Then down to (8,8) which is X. Perfect! So that would be a valid path.\n\nSo let's see if that path is possible. Let me check each step:\n\n(0,0) → down to (1,0): valid.\n\n(1,0) → right to (1,2): valid (since column 1 is *).\n\n(1,2) → down to (2,2): valid.\n\n(2,2) → right to (2,4): valid (column 3 is * so can't go through, but moving from 2 to 4 in column, which skips column 3? No, moving right one step at a time. From (2,2) → right to (2,3)? No, because row 2 column 3 is * (row 2 is o*o*o*ooo → columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, etc. So from (2,2), can't move right to column 3. So how to get from (2,2) to (2,4)? Well, since column 3 is blocked, you have to move right two steps? No, you can't. Because between column 2 and 4 is column 3 which is a wall. Therefore, you can't move directly from (2,2) to (2,4). Oops! That's a problem. So my earlier assumption was wrong. From (2,2), moving right is blocked at column 3. Therefore, I need to find another way.\n\nSo backtracking. Let me think again. How to get from (2,2) to somewhere else. From (2,2), possible moves are up, down, left, or right. Up would take me back to (1,2). Down to (3,2). Let's check row 3, column 2. Row 3 is o*o***o**, which is columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, etc. So (3,2) is o. So from (2,2) down to (3,2). Then from there?\n\nAt (3,2), can move up (back), down, left (column 1 is *), or right (column 3 is *). So maybe down again. Let's go down to (4,2). Row 4, column 2 is o (row 4 is o*ooo*ooo → columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, etc). So (4,2) is o. From there, maybe move down again to (5,2). Row 5 is o***o*o**, columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, etc. So (5,2) is * (blocked). Can't go there. So need to find another direction. From (4,2), can move right? Let's see. Column 3 in row 4 is o (row 4: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: *, ...). So from (4,2), moving right to (4,3) is allowed. Then from (4,3), perhaps move down or right.\n\nSo path so far:\n\n(0,0) → down → (1,0) → down → (2,0)? Wait, earlier I thought from (1,2) down to (2,2), but that led to a problem. Let me retrace.\n\nOriginal path:\n\nStart at (0,0). Down to (1,0). From there, can I move right? Let's see. (1,0) is row 1, column 0. To move right, check column 1 is *, so can't. So only possible moves from (1,0) are down or left (but left is out of bounds). So must go down to (2,0).\n\nAh! Earlier mistake. I thought from (1,0) I could go to (1,2), but that's not possible because column 1 is a wall. So from (1,0), can't move right. So from (1,0), only down to (2,0).\n\nSo correcting the path:\n\n(0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → ... Let me re-examine.\n\nSo starting again:\n\nAt (0,0). Move down to (1,0). From there, down to (2,0). Then down to (3,0). Then down to (4,0). Then down to (5,0). Now, row 5, column 0 is o. From (5,0), can I move right? Let's check. Row 5: columns 0 is o, column 1 is *, so can't move right. So need to move down. From (5,0) down to (6,0). Row 6, column 0 is o. From there down to (7,0). Row 7, column 0 is o. Down to (8,0). Now, same problem as before: need to get from (8,0) to (8,8). But columns 1,3,5,7 are blocked. So how?\n\nFrom (8,0), need to move right to column 2. But column 1 is blocked. So can't. So perhaps this path is not working. Maybe going straight down isn't the way.\n\nAlternative approach: from earlier steps. Let me try a different route. Starting at (0,0). Move right to (0,1), (0,2), etc., instead of going down.\n\nFrom (0,0), moving right to (0,1) is allowed since it's o. Then right to (0,2), etc. Let's see if we can go all the way right? Row 0 is all o's. So from (0,0) to (0,8). But (0,8) is o? Yes. Then from there, move down to row 1, column 8? Let's check row 1, column 8: the first row (row 0) is I followed by 8 o's. Row 1 is o*o*o*o** → columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *. So (1,8) is *, blocked. So can't move down from (0,8) to (1,8). So need to find another way.\n\nFrom (0,8), perhaps move down to (1,7)? No, because to get to (1,7), need to be at (0,7) and move down. But (0,7) is o. So from (0,7) down to (1,7). But (1,7) is *? Row 1, column 7 is *, yes. So blocked. So can't. So maybe from (0,8), move down to (1,8) is blocked. So perhaps from row 0, moving all the way right isn't helpful. Maybe need to combine right and down moves.\n\nLet me try another path. Starting at (0,0). Move right to (0,1), then down to (1,1) — but that's a wall. No. So from (0,1), possible moves are down or left or right. Let's try moving down from (0,1) to (1,1) is blocked. So can't. So from (0,1), must move right or left. Since left is (0,0), maybe move right to (0,2). Then down? Let's see.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving down to (1,2) which is o. So that's allowed. Now at (1,2). From there, can move down to (2,2), which is o. Then down to (3,2), which is o. Then down to (4,2), o. Then down to (5,2). Let's check row 5, column 2: row 5 is o***o*o** → columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, ... So (5,2) is *, blocked. Can't move there. So need to find another way from (4,2). From (4,2), possible moves: up (back), right, or down (blocked). Let's try moving right. From (4,2), moving right to (4,3). Row 4, column 3 is o (row 4: o*ooo*ooo → columns 3 is o). So allowed. Now at (4,3). From there, can move down to (5,3)? Let's check row 5, column 3. Row 5 is o***o*o** → columns 3 is *? Let me parse row 5 again: \"o***o*o**\" → columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: *. So column 3 is *, blocked. Can't move down. So from (4,3), can move right to (4,4). Which is o. Then down to (5,4). Row 5, column 4 is o. Yes! So from (4,4) down to (5,4). Now at (5,4). From here, can move down to (6,4). Let's check row 6, column 4. Row 6 is \"ooo*o*ooo\" → columns 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o. So (6,4) is o. From there, down to (7,4). Row 7 is \"o*o*o*o*o\" → columns 4 is o. So (7,4) is o. From there, down to (8,4). Row 8: \"o*o*o*o*X\" → column 4 is o. Now at (8,4). From there, need to move right to (8,6), then to (8,8). Let's see: column 5 is *, so can't go directly. From (8,4), move right to (8,5) is blocked. So need another way. Perhaps from (8,4), move up? Let's see. From (8,4), up to (7,4). From there, maybe move right. Let me think.\n\nAt (7,4), can move right to (7,5). Let's check row 7, column 5. Row 7 is o*o*o*o*o → columns 5 is *. So can't. How about right to (7,6)? Let's see. Columns 5 is *, so can't move directly. From (7,4), move up to (6,4), then right? Or other directions. Let me backtrack.\n\nSo the path so far is:\n\nStart → right to (0,1) → right to (0,2) → down to (1,2) → down to (2,2) → down to (3,2) → down to (4,2) → right to (4,3) → right to (4,4) → down to (5,4) → down to (6,4) → down to (7,4) → down to (8,4).\n\nNow at (8,4). Need to reach X at (8,8). Let's see if there's a way from here. From (8,4), perhaps move up to (7,4), then right. Let's try:\n\nFrom (8,4) up to (7,4). From there, can move right to (7,5)? No, it's *. How about right to (7,6)? Let me check row 7, column 6. Row 7 is o*o*o*o*o → columns 6 is o. So from (7,4), can I move right to (7,5) (blocked) and then to (7,6)? No, need to move step by step. From (7,4), moving right to (7,5) is blocked. So can't. What about moving up from (7,4) to (6,4)? Already been there. Maybe move left? From (7,4), left to (7,3). Let's check row 7, column 3 is * (since row 7 is o*o*o*o*o → columns 3 is *). Can't. So stuck?\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another path earlier. Let me think. When I was at (6,4), perhaps instead of going down all the way to (8,4), I should have gone right?\n\nAt (6,4), from there, can I move right? Let's check. Row 6, column 4 is o. Moving right to (6,5) is blocked (since row 6 column 5 is *). So can't. How about moving up? From (6,4) up to (5,4). Then right? Let's see.\n\nAt (5,4), which is o. From there, can move right to (5,5) (blocked), or down? No, already came from there. Or left? Not helpful. Or right to (5,5) is blocked. How about moving right to (5,6)? Let's see. From (5,4), moving right to (5,5) is blocked, then to (5,6)? No, can't skip. So maybe from (5,4), move up to (4,4). Which is already part of the path. Not helpful.\n\nAlternative idea: when I was at (4,4), instead of going down to (5,4), maybe move right to (4,5)? No, because row 4 column 5 is * (row 4: o*ooo*ooo → column 5 is *). Can't. So no. So perhaps this path is stuck. Need to find another way.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Maybe there's a way to go through the middle of the maze. Let me try to find a different route.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's go down to (1,0), then right to (1,2), down to (2,2), right to (2,4), down to (3,4) — but row 3, column 4 is * (as discussed earlier). Can't. So from (2,4), move right to (2,6) as before. Then down to (3,6). From there, down to (4,6), then down to (5,6), down to (6,6), then right to (6,7), (6,8), then down to (7,8), then down to (8,8). But earlier I thought there was a problem with getting to (2,4) from (2,2). Let me re-examine that.\n\nFrom (1,2) down to (2,2). Now at (2,2). From here, can I move down to (3,2)? Yes. Then from (3,2), down to (4,2). Then from (4,2), move right to (4,3) and (4,4), then down as before. But how to get from (2,2) to (2,4)? It's blocked. So instead, from (2,2), go down to (3,2), then right?\n\nAt (3,2), can I move right to (3,3)? No, it's *. How about down to (4,2), then right to (4,3), then down, etc. Let's try that.\n\nPath:\n\n(0,0) → down → (1,0) → down → (2,0) → down → (3,0) → down → (4,0) → right to (4,1)? No, it's *. Can't. So from (4,0), move right to (4,1) is blocked. So must move down? From (4,0) down to (5,0). Row 5, column 0 is o. From there down to (6,0), then to (7,0), then to (8,0). Again stuck at (8,0).\n\nThis seems challenging. Maybe I need to find a path that combines both horizontal and vertical moves in a different way.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's look for a path from the end backwards. The destination is at (8,8). Let's see what cells can reach it. From (8,8), the previous step could be (8,7) or (7,8). Let's check what's at (8,7). The last row is o*o*o*o*X. So column 7 is *, so can't come from (8,7). So must come from (7,8). What is (7,8)? Row 7, column 8 is o. So to get to (7,8), previous steps could be (7,7) or (6,8). Let's check (6,8): row 6, column 8 is o. So from (6,8) down to (7,8), then to (8,8). So path from (6,8) → down → down.\n\nSo need to get to (6,8). How to reach (6,8)? From (6,7) right, or (5,8) down. Let's check (6,7): row 6, column 7 is o. So if I can reach (6,7), then move right to (6,8). How to get to (6,7)? From (6,6) right, or (5,7) down.\n\nRow 6, column 7 is o. Let's see. Let's work backwards further. To get to (6,7), maybe from (5,7). What's at (5,7)? Row 5 is o***o*o** → columns 7 is *. So no. From (6,6) right. To get to (6,6), maybe from (5,6) down. Row 5, column 6 is o. How to reach (5,6)? From (4,6) down, or (5,5) right (but column 5 is *). So from (4,6) down. To reach (4,6), from (3,6) down, or (4,5) right (but column 5 is *). So from (3,6) down. How to get to (3,6)? From (2,6) down, or (3,5) right (blocked). From (2,6) down. How to get to (2,6)? From (2,5) right (blocked), (2,7) left, or (1,6) down. Let's check (1,6): row 1, column 6 is o. From there down to (2,6). How to get to (1,6)? From (0,6) down, or (1,5) right (blocked). From (0,6) down. So (0,6) is o. So path from (0,6) down to (1,6), down to (2,6), down to (3,6), down to (4,6), down to (5,6), down to (6,6), right to (6,7), right to (6,8), down to (7,8), down to (8,8). Let's check if this path is possible.\n\nLet me verify each step:\n\nStart at (0,0). Need to get to (0,6). From (0,0), move right to (0,1), (0,2), ..., (0,6). Since row 0 is all o's, this is possible. So from (0,0), move right 6 times to (0,6). Then down to (1,6). From there down to (2,6), then to (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). From (6,6) move right to (6,7), then to (6,8). Then down to (7,8), then down to (8,8). Let's check if these positions are valid.\n\nCheck row 1, column 6: yes, row 1 is o*o*o*o**, column 6 is o.\n\nRow 2, column 6: row 2 is o*o*o*ooo → column 6 is o.\n\nRow 3, column 6: row 3 is o*o***o** → column 6 is o.\n\nRow 4, column 6: row 4 is o*ooo*ooo → column 6 is o.\n\nRow 5, column 6: row 5 is o***o*o** → column 6 is o.\n\nRow 6, column 6: row 6 is ooo*o*ooo → column 6 is o.\n\nYes. And from (6,6) to (6,7): row 6, column 7 is o (row 6: columns 7 is o). Then to (6,8): o. Then down to (7,8): row 7, column 8 is o. Down to (8,8): X. Perfect! So this path works.\n\nNow, let's map out the moves from start to end.\n\nStarting at (0,0). To get to (0,6), need to move right 6 times. Then down 6 times to (6,6). Then right twice to (6,8). Then down twice to (8,8).\n\nBut let's count the exact steps:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (0,6): right 6 times.\n\nThen from (0,6) down to (1,6): down.\n\nThen down to (2,6): down.\n\nDown to (3,6): down.\n\nDown to (4,6): down.\n\nDown to (5,6): down.\n\nDown to (6,6): down. That's 6 down moves (from row 0 to row 6: 6 steps).\n\nThen from (6,6) to (6,7): right.\n\nFrom (6,7) to (6,8): right.\n\nThen down to (7,8): down.\n\nThen down to (8,8): down.\n\nTotal moves: right x6, down x6, right x2, down x2. Total of 6+6+2+2=16 moves.\n\nBut let me confirm each step:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nMoves:\n\n['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']\n\nYes. That would be the list.\n\nBut let me check if there are any walls in this path. For example, when moving down from (0,6) to (1,6), which is allowed. And so on. All steps are valid.\n\nThis seems like a valid path. So the answer would be this list of moves.\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path, but since the user didn't specify shortest, any valid path is acceptable. This seems to work.\n\nNow, translating this into the required list of moves. The moves are:\n\nRight six times, then down six times, then right twice, then down twice.\n\nSo the answer would be:\n\n['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']\n\nBut let me count again:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (0,6): 6 rights.\n\nThen down 6 times to (6,6).\n\nThen right twice to (6,8).\n\nThen down twice to (8,8).\n\nYes, that's 6+6+2+2=16 moves.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more optimal path, but this one works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a shorter path by combining some down and right moves earlier, but for the purpose of this problem, this path is valid.\n\nThus, the answer is the list of moves as described.\n ;Answer: ['right','right','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','right','right','down','down']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this maze and find a path from the start 'I' to the destination 'X'. The maze is given as a series of lines, each line representing a row. Let me first try to visualize the maze. \n\nFirst, I should probably parse the maze into a grid. The user provided the maze as 13 rows (since there are 13 lines), each of varying lengths, but since it's an n x n maze, maybe there's some padding? Wait, the user said it's an n x n maze. Let me check the length of each row. Let's count the characters in each line:\n\nLooking at the first line: \"Ioo*o*o*ooooo\" – let's count. I, o, o, *, o, *, o, *, o, o, o, o, o. That's 13 characters. Then the next line: \"o*o*o*o***o**\" – same length? Let's see: o, *, o, *, o, *, o, *, *, *, o, *, * – that's 13. So maybe it's a 13x13 grid. Let me check all rows:\n\nThird line: \"o*ooooooo*ooo\" – 13 characters. Fourth: \"o*********o**\" – o followed by 9 * then o and two *? Let me count: 1+9+3? Hmm, maybe I need to recount. Let me write them all down properly. But maybe it's easier to assume that each row is 13 characters. Anyway, the exact dimensions might not matter as much as the positions.\n\nThe start is 'I' and the end is 'X'. So first, I need to find where the 'I' is located. Let's look at the first line. The first character is 'I', so position (0,0) assuming rows are y and columns x, with (0,0) being top-left. Wait, but in mazes, usually the starting point is at (row, column). Let me confirm. Let's take the first line as row 0. The first line is \"Ioo*o*o*ooooo\". So the first character is I at (0,0). Then the rest of the line. The destination 'X' is in the last line. Let me check the last line: \"ooo*ooooooooX\". The last character is X, so position (12, 12) if it's 13x13. But maybe not. Let me check the length again. For example, the last line: \"ooo*ooooooooX\" – o o o * o o o o o o o X. Let me count: 3 o, then *, then 8 o, then X. That's 3 + 1 + 8 + 1 = 13 characters. So yes, each line is 13 characters. So the maze is 13x13. So the starting position is (0,0), and the ending is (12,12).\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (12,12), moving up, down, left, right, avoiding the walls ('*').\n\nSince the user wants the path as a list of moves (up, down, left, right), I need to find a valid path. Let me think about how to approach this. Since I'm not a computer, I'll have to do a manual search, perhaps using BFS (Breadth-First Search) approach or DFS. Let me try to map the maze mentally.\n\nStarting at (0,0). The first line is Ioo*o*o*ooooo. So the first row: positions 0-12:\n\nRow 0: [I, o, o, *, o, *, o, *, o, o, o, o, o]\n\nSo from (0,0), possible moves. Let's see: can I move right? The next cell is (0,1) which is o, passable. Can I move down? The cell below is (1,0), which is 'o' (second line starts with o). So initial options are down or right. Let me try to sketch possible paths.\n\nBut doing this manually is error-prone. Let me try to find a path step by step.\n\nLet me start by writing down the coordinates of the start and end points. Start is (0,0), end is (12,12). Let me try to trace a path.\n\nFirst, from (0,0). Let's consider possible directions. Let me try to move down first. Moving down to (1,0). Let me check the maze rows:\n\nRow 1: o*o*o*o***o**\n\nBreaking it down: positions 0 to 12:\n\nRow 1: [o, *, o, *, o, *, o, *, *, *, o, *, *]\n\nSo (1,0) is 'o' (passable). Then from (1,0), can I move down again? Row 2, column 0: Row 2 is \"o*ooooooo*ooo\". Let's see: first character is 'o', so (2,0) is o. So moving down again to (2,0). Now, from (2,0), can I continue down? Let's check row 3, column 0. Row 3 is \"o*********o**\". First character is 'o', so (3,0) is o. But then row 4 starts with \"o*********o**\"? Wait, row 3 is \"o*********o**\". So moving down to row 3, column 0 is o. Then row 4: \"ooooooooooooo\" – first character o. So (4,0) is o. Then row 5 starts with o? Let me check the fifth row (assuming rows are 0-based). The fifth line is \"o*****o*o****\". So (5,0) is o. Then row 6 starts with o? Sixth line is \"ooooo*o*ooooo\", so (6,0) is o. Row 7: \"o*o*o********\" → (7,0) is o? No, first character is o? Let me check. The line is \"o*o*o********\". First character is o. So yes. So row 7, column 0 is o. Then row 8: \"o*o*ooooooooo\" → (8,0) is o? First character is o. So yes. Row 9: \"o*o*o*o*****o\" → (9,0) is o. Row 10: \"o*o*o*ooooo*o\" → (10,0) is o. Row 11: \"o***o********\" → (11,0) is o. Row 12: \"ooo*ooooooooX\" → (12,0) is o. \n\nSo if I keep moving down from (0,0) to (1,0), (2,0), etc., all the way down to row 12, column 0. But then I'm at (12,0), and need to get to (12,12). Let's see row 12: \"ooo*ooooooooX\". So positions 0-12:\n\nRow 12: o o o * o o o o o o o X. Wait, the last character is X. So position (12, 12) is X. So from (12,0), I need to move right through row 12. But there's a * at position 3 (column 3?), so from column 0 to column 2, then column 3 is *, so can't pass. So this path down to the bottom left is blocked. Therefore, moving straight down from the start is not helpful. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternative: from (0,0), move right. Let's see. Starting at (0,0). Let's try to move right. (0,0) → (0,1). Then (0,1) is o. Let's see the first row: positions 0-12. The first row is I (0,0), then o (0,1), o (0,2), * (0,3), o (0,4), * (0,5), o (0,6), * (0,7), o (0,8), o (0,9), o (0,10), o (0,11), o (0,12). So the first row has obstacles at positions 3,5,7. So from (0,0), moving right to (0,1), then maybe further right? Let's see. Let's try to move right as much as possible. From (0,0), moving right to (0,1), then to (0,2). At (0,2), can't move right to (0,3) since that's a wall. So from (0,2), maybe move down to row 1, column 2. Let's check row 1's column 2: row 1 is [o, *, o, *, o, *, o, *, *, *, o, *, *]. So column 2 is o. So moving down from (0,2) to (1,2). Then, from (1,2), can we move right? Let's check. Column 3 of row 1 is *, so no. So maybe move down again to row 2, column 2. Row 2's column 2 is o (since row 2 is o*ooooooo*ooo. Let me parse row 2: \"o*ooooooo*ooo\". Breaking it down:\n\nRow 2: [o, *, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, *, o, o, o]. Wait, let me count. The string is \"o*ooooooo*ooo\". So:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: o\n\n4: o\n\n5: o\n\n6: o\n\n7: o\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: o\n\n11: o\n\n12: o\n\nSo yes, column 2 of row 2 is o. So moving down from (1,2) to (2,2). Now at (2,2). Let me think. From here, perhaps move right. Let's see. Let me check row 2's columns. From column 2, moving right. Let's see how far we can go. The row is o*ooooooo*ooo. So columns 2 to 8 are all o (since from 2 to 8, there's o's until column 8, then column 9 is *). So from (2,2), moving right to (2,3), (2,4), etc. Maybe that's a path. Let's try that.\n\nSo from (2,2), moving right to (2,3). Then (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). Then column 9 is *, so can't go further right. From (2,8), perhaps move down. Let's check row 3, column 8. Row 3 is \"o*********o**\". Let's see. Row 3's column 8: since the row is o followed by 9 * then o and two *? Let me parse:\n\nRow 3: \"o*********o**\" → first character o, then 9 *? Let me count. Let's say:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: *\n\n3: *\n\n4: *\n\n5: *\n\n6: *\n\n7: *\n\n8: *\n\n9: *\n\n10: o\n\n11: *\n\n12: *\n\nSo column 8 of row 3 is *, so moving down from (2,8) to (3,8) is a wall. Not allowed. So maybe from (2,8), move up or left? Or perhaps move down earlier. Let me backtrack. Maybe instead of going all the way right in row 2, perhaps find a better path. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's try to find a path that goes right and down, avoiding walls. Maybe using BFS. But since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can try to find a path step by step.\n\nLet me try again. Starting at (0,0). Let's consider possible paths. From (0,0), can go down to (1,0) or right to (0,1).\n\nOption 1: Go down to (1,0). Then from (1,0), down to (2,0). Then down to (3,0). But row 3, column 0 is o. Then down to (4,0). Row 4 is all o's? Let me check. The fifth line (row 4) is \"ooooooooooooo\" — yes, all o's. So (4,0) is o. Then from (4,0), moving down to (5,0). Row 5 is \"o*****o*o****\". Let me parse row 5's column 0: it's o. So yes. From (5,0), can I move down to (6,0)? Row 6 is \"ooooo*o*ooooo\", column 0 is o. So yes. Then (7,0): row 7 is \"o*o*o********\", column 0 is o. From (7,0), moving down to (8,0): row 8 is \"o*o*ooooooooo\", column 0 is o. Then (9,0): row 9 is \"o*o*o*o*****o\", column 0 is o. Then (10,0): row 10 is \"o*o*o*ooooo*o\", column 0 is o. Then (11,0): row 11 is \"o***o********\", column 0 is o. Then (12,0): row 12 is \"ooo*ooooooooX\", column 0 is o. \n\nSo if I go down all the way to (12,0), then I need to move right. But as before, row 12 has a wall at column 3. So from (12,0), can move right to (12,1), (12,2), (12,3) is wall. So stuck. So this path is blocked. Therefore, going straight down is not helpful. So maybe need to deviate from the left column.\n\nAlternative approach: from (0,0), move right. Let's try that. Starting at (0,0), move right to (0,1). Then again right to (0,2). Can't go further right because (0,3) is a wall. So from (0,2), move down to (1,2). Row 1, column 2 is o. Then from (1,2), maybe move down to (2,2). Row 2, column 2 is o. Then from (2,2), move right. Let's see. Row 2, columns 2 to 8 are o's (as discussed earlier). So moving right to (2, 12)? No, row 2's column 9 is *, so can't go beyond column 8. Let's say we go to (2,8). From there, maybe move down. Let's check row 3, column 8. As before, row 3, column 8 is * (since row 3 is o followed by 9 *s, then o and two *s). So can't go down. So maybe move down earlier. Let's think.\n\nFrom (2,2), perhaps move down to (3,2). Let's check row 3, column 2. Row 3 is \"o*********o**\". So column 0 is o, then columns 1-9 are *? Let me parse:\n\nRow 3: o followed by 9 *? Let me count. The string is \"o*********o**\". The first * starts at column 1. How many *? Let's see:\n\nBetween the o and the next o: \"*********\", which is 9 *? Let me count:\n\nThe string is o followed by 9 stars, then o and two stars. So columns 0: o, 1-9: *, 10: o, 11: *, 12: *. Therefore, column 2 of row 3 is *, so can't move down from (2,2) to (3,2). So that's blocked. So from (2,2), can't move down. So maybe move right further. Let's go to (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → ... up to (2,8). Then from (2,8), maybe move up? Or left? Or try to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,2), move down to row 3 if possible. But since row 3, column 2 is *, can't. So maybe move right to (2, 3), then check if there's a way down. Let's see. For example, at (2, 10): row 2's column 10 is o. Let me check. Earlier parsing of row 2: columns up to 9 is *, then columns 10-12 are o. So from (2, 8), moving right to (2,9) is blocked by a wall. So no. So maybe from (2,8), move up to row 1, column 8. Let's check row 1, column 8. Row 1 is [o, *, o, *, o, *, o, *, *, *, o, *, *]. Column 8 is *, so no. Not helpful. Hmm. Maybe from (2,8), move left back? Not helpful.\n\nAlternative idea: from (2,2), move right to (2, 8), then move down to row 3 if possible. But row 3, column 8 is *? Yes. So no. So perhaps from (2,8), move up to row 1, column 8. But row 1's column 8 is * (as per earlier). So no. Hmm. Maybe this path is stuck. Let me backtrack again.\n\nFrom (1,2), instead of moving down to (2,2), perhaps move right. Let's check row 1, column 3 is * (since row 1 is [o, *, o, *, ...]. So column 3 is *, so can't move right. So from (1,2), can't move right. What about moving down to (2,2)? Yes. Which we tried earlier. So maybe that's the only option.\n\nAlternative idea: from (1,2), move down to (2,2), then move right to (2, 2) → (2, 3) → ... up to (2, 8), then from there, move up to row 1, column 8? No, because row 1 column 8 is *.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different path. Let me think of another approach. Let's try to look for the end point. The end is at (12,12). Let me check row 12. The last row is \"ooo*ooooooooX\". So column 12 is X. Let's see what's around it. Column 11: o, column 10: o, column 9: o, column 8: o, column 7: o, column 6: o, column 5: o, column 4: o, column 3: *, column 2: o, column 1: o, column 0: o. So to reach (12,12), we need to approach from the left. But column 3 is a wall. So the path to (12,12) must come from the left side (columns 4-12 of row 12). Let's look at row 12, column 4 is o. So how to get to row 12, column 4?\n\nLooking up from row 12, column 4. The cell above is row 11, column 4. Let's check row 11. Row 11 is \"o***o********\". Let's parse row 11: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: o, 4: ?, then followed by *s. So column 4 is o? Let me check. The string is \"o***o********\". Let me break it down:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: *\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: *\n\n7: *\n\n8: *\n\n9: *\n\n10: *\n\n11: *\n\n12: *\n\nYes. So row 11, column 4 is o. So from row 11, column 4, can move down to row 12, column 4. Then from there, move right to reach X. So how to get to row 11, column 4?\n\nLooking at row 11, column 4. Let's see what's above it. Row 10, column 4. Row 10 is \"o*o*o*ooooo*o\". Let me parse:\n\nRow 10: o * o * o * o o o o o * o. Let me count columns:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: o\n\n8: o\n\n9: o\n\n10: o\n\n11: *\n\n12: o\n\nSo column 4 is o. Therefore, from row 10, column 4, can move down to row 11, column 4. How to get to row 10, column 4?\n\nLooking at row 10, column 4. What's above that? Row 9, column 4. Row 9 is \"o*o*o*o*****o\". Let's parse:\n\nRow 9: o * o * o * o * * * * * o. Let me check columns:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: *\n\n9: *\n\n10: *\n\n11: *\n\n12: o\n\nSo column 4 is o. So from row 9, column 4, can move down to row 10, column 4. How to reach row 9, column 4?\n\nRow 8, column 4. Row 8 is \"o*o*ooooooooo\". Let's parse:\n\nRow 8: o * o * o o o o o o o o o. Columns:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: o\n\n6: o\n\n7: o\n\n8: o\n\n9: o\n\n10: o\n\n11: o\n\n12: o\n\nSo column 4 is o. So from row 8, column 4, move down to row 9, column 4. How to reach row 8, column 4?\n\nRow 7, column 4. Row 7 is \"o*o*o********\". Let's parse:\n\nRow 7: o * o * o * * * * * * * *. Columns:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: *\n\n7: *\n\n8: *\n\n9: *\n\n10: *\n\n11: *\n\n12: *\n\nSo column 4 is o. So from row 7, column 4, can move down to row 8, column 4. How to reach row 7, column 4?\n\nLooking at row 6, column 4. Row 6 is \"ooooo*o*ooooo\". Let's parse:\n\nRow 6: o o o o o * o * o o o o o. Columns:\n\n0: o\n\n1: o\n\n2: o\n\n3: o\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: o\n\n10: o\n\n11: o\n\n12: o\n\nSo column 4 is o. So from row 6, column 4, move down to row 7, column 4. How to reach row 6, column 4?\n\nRow 5, column 4. Row 5 is \"o*****o*o****\". Let me parse:\n\nRow 5: o * * * * * o * o * * * * *. Columns:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: *\n\n3: *\n\n4: *\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: *\n\n11: *\n\n12: *\n\nSo column 4 is *, so can't come from there. So how to get to row 6, column 4? Let's look at other paths. Maybe from row 6, column 3 or 5?\n\nLooking at row 6, column 4 is o. Let's see what's around. From row 5, column 6 is o (row 5's column 6 is o). So perhaps there's a way to get to row 6, column 4 via other routes. For example, if I can reach row 6, column 6, then move left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different path. Let's backtrack. Let me try to find a path from the start that reaches this area.\n\nLet me try again. Starting from (0,0). Let's try to go right to (0,1), then down to (1,1). Wait, row 1, column 1 is * (as per row 1's structure). So can't. So earlier, from (0,2), moving down to (1,2). Then to (2,2), then right. Let's try that again.\n\nFrom (2,2), moving right to (2, 4) (since column 4 is o). Then maybe from there, move down. Let me check row 3, column 4. Row 3 is all *s from column 1-9 except column 10. So column 4 of row 3 is *. Can't move down. So perhaps from (2,4), move down when possible. Let's see. Maybe move down when we reach a row where column 4 is passable. Let me check row 4. Row 4 is all o's. So yes. From (2,4), move down to (3,4). Wait, row 3, column 4 is *, so no. Can't. So stuck again. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: from (2,2), move right to (2, 8), then move down to row 3, column 8, which is * (blocked). No. What if I go to row 2, column 10? Since row 2's column 10 is o. Let me check. From (2,2), moving right to (2,10). How? Let's see. From (2,2) → (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9) is *? Earlier, row 2's column 9 is *, so can't go to (2,9). So up to (2,8). From there, can't move further right. So stuck again.\n\nMaybe I need to find another way. Let's try to look for a different route. Let's think about row 4, which is all o's. If I can get to row 4, maybe I can move freely. How to get there?\n\nFrom earlier steps: from (2,2), moving down to (3,2) is blocked. So perhaps from (2,2), move right to (2, 2) to (2, 8), then move up to row 1, column 8 (which is *), no. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me try to go from the start, down to row 4, then move right.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Down to (1,0), (2,0), (3,0). Row 3, column 0 is o. Then down to (4,0). Row 4 is all o's. Now at (4,0). From here, I can move right freely. Let's try to move right. Let's go from (4,0) to (4,1), (4,2), etc. Let's see what's in row 4. Since it's all o's, I can move all the way to (4,12). But how to get from there to the end?\n\nFrom (4,12), need to move up or down. Let's see. From (4,12), moving down to row 5, column 12. Let me check row 5's column 12. Row 5 is \"o*****o*o****\". Column 12 is *. So can't. Moving up to row 3, column 12. Row 3's column 12 is * (as per earlier). So no. So stuck again. Hmm.\n\nBut maybe from row 4, somewhere in the middle, there's a way to go up or down. For example, let's say from (4,4), move up to row 3, column 4 which is * (blocked). Or down to row 5, column 4. Let me check row 5, column 4. Row 5 is \"o*****o*o****\". Columns 0: o, then columns 1-5 are *, column 6: o, etc. So column 4 is *, so can't move there. So no. So perhaps from row 4, move to a position where I can go down to a lower row that isn't blocked.\n\nFor example, let's say I'm at (4, 6). From there, move down to row 5, column 6. Row 5, column 6 is o. Yes! Because row 5's column 6 is o. Let me confirm. Earlier parsing of row 5: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o. Yes. So from (4,6), moving down to (5,6). Great. So how to get to (4,6)? From (4,0), moving right to (4,6). Yes. So path could be:\n\nStart → down to (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0). Then move right to (4,6). Then down to (5,6). From there, maybe proceed.\n\nNow, from (5,6), what's next? Let's see. Row 5's column 6 is o. Let me check what's around. Can I move right? Row 5's column 7 is * (since row 5 is up to column 8: let me parse row 5 again: \"o*****o*o****\". Columns 0: o, 1-5: *, column 6: o, column 7: *, column 8: o, then columns 9-12: *. So from (5,6), moving right to column 7 is *, blocked. Moving left to (5,5) is *, blocked. So can move up or down. Let's try moving down to (6,6). Row 6 is \"ooooo*o*ooooo\". Column 6 is o. Yes. So from (5,6), down to (6,6). Now at (6,6). From here, what can I do? Let's look around. Row 6 is all o's except columns 5 and 7. Let me parse row 6: columns 0-4: o, column 5: *, column 6: o, column 7: *, then columns 8-12: o. So from (6,6), can move right to (6,7)? No, because column 7 is *. Can move left to (6,5)? No, column 5 is *. So can move up or down. Let's move down to (7,6). Row 7 is \"o*o*o********\". Let me check column 6. Row 7: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, ... So column 6 is *, so can't move down. So move up to (5,6) again? Not helpful. Hmm. So maybe from (6,6), move left to (6,5)? No, blocked. Or right? No. What about moving up to row 5, column 6 again? Not helpful. Maybe need to go elsewhere.\n\nAlternative idea: from (6,6), move left to (6,5) is blocked. How about moving up to row 5, column 6? No, already there. Or maybe move to the left via other paths. For example, from (6,6), move left to column 4 (which is o), but how? Let me see. From (6,6), can I move up to row 5, column 6, then left? No. Or maybe move left along row 6 to column 4? Let me check row 6. From column 6, moving left to column 5 is blocked. So no. Hmm. This seems stuck.\n\nAlternative approach: From (5,6), instead of moving down to (6,6), move up to (4,6). Then move right. From (4,6), can I move right to (4,12)? Yes. Then from there, move down? Let's see. (4,12) is in row 4. Down to row 5, column 12 is *, blocked. Up to row 3, column 12 is *, blocked. So stuck again. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to find another route. Let me think about row 6. From (6,6), perhaps move left to (6,4), but how? Let's see. If I can move left through columns that are o. Let me check row 6. Columns 0-4 are o, column 5 is *, column 6 is o, column 7 is *, columns 8-12 are o. So from (6,6), to get to column 4, I need to move left through column 5, which is blocked. No. So no. Hmm.\n\nLet me try to backtrack further. Let's think about how I got to (5,6). From (4,6) down. How to get to (4,6)? From (4,0) moving right. Let me think if there's a different way to reach row 5. For example, from row 4, column 8, move down to row 5, column 8. Let me check row 5's column 8. Row 5 is \"o*****o*o****\". Column 8 is o. Yes. So if I can get to (4,8), then move down to (5,8). How to get to (4,8)? From (4,0) moving right to (4,8). Yes. So let's try that.\n\nSo path: start → down to (4,0), move right to (4,8), then down to (5,8). Now at (5,8). Let's see. Row 5's column 8 is o. What's around? Can I move right? Column 9 is * (row 5's columns after 8 are *). So no. Can move left to (5,7)? Column 7 is * (row 5's column 7 is *). No. Can move up to (4,8), which is o. Can move down to row 6, column 8. Row 6's column 8 is o. Yes. So move down to (6,8). Now at (6,8). Row 6's column 8 is o. From here, can move right to (6,9), (6,10), (6,11), (6,12). Let's move right to (6,12). Then down to row 7, column 12? Let's check row 7's column 12. Row 7 is \"o*o*o********\". Column 12 is *. So no. From (6,12), can move down to row 7, column 12 is *, no. Move up to row 5, column 12 is *, no. So stuck. Hmm. But from (6,12), can move left. Let's see. Row 6, columns 8-12 are o. So from (6,12), move left to (6,8), then maybe down to row 7, column 8. Let me check row 7's column 8. Row 7 is \"o*o*o********\". Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: *, ... So column 8 is *, so can't move down. So stuck again.\n\nHmm. Let me think of another way. From (6,8), perhaps move down to row 7, column 8 is * (blocked), so no. Move up to (5,8) again. From (5,8), move up to (4,8). From there, move right to (4,12), then down to row 5, column 12 is * (blocked). Not helpful. \n\nAlternative idea: From (6,8), move left to (6,7) is blocked. Move left to (6,6) is o? No, row 6's column 7 is *, so can't. Wait, row 6's column 7 is *, so from (6,8), moving left to (6,7) is blocked. How about moving up to row 5, column 8, then left? Let's see. From (5,8), can I move left? Let's check row 5's columns. Row 5's column 8 is o. To the left, column 7 is *, so no. Hmm. \n\nMaybe I need to find another path. Let me think about row 8. Let me look at row 8: \"o*o*ooooooooo\". Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, then o's. So from row 8, column 4, it's o and can move right. If I can get to row 8, column 4, then proceed. How to get there?\n\nLet me think. From row 6, column 4? Let me check. Row 6's column 4 is o. Let me see. If I can get to (6,4), then move down to row 7, column 4. Row 7's column 4 is o. Yes. Then down to row 8, column 4. \n\nSo how to get to (6,4)? Let's see. From row 4, column 4, move down to (5,4). Wait, row 5's column 4 is * (as discussed earlier). No. Can't. How else? Let's think. From row 6, column 0 to 4 are o. So if I can get to row 6, column 4 via some path. For example, from row 5, column 6 (which is o), move left through row 5's columns? No, because row 5 has * from columns 1-5. So can't. How about from row 4, column 4, move down to row 5, column 4? No, because it's *. \n\nAlternative idea: Let me try to find a way to reach row 6, column 4. Maybe from the left. For example, from row 6, column 0, move right to (6,4). How to get to row 6, column 0? Let's see. From earlier steps, if I go down to (4,0), then move right to (4,0) to (4,0)... No. Wait, I can go from (4,0) up to row 3, column 0, then down again? No. Or from (4,0), move right to (4,0)... Wait, I'm already there. So from (4,0), move right to (4,4), then down to row 5, column 4 is blocked. No. Hmm. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's try to use BFS or DFS manually, keeping track of visited positions.\n\nLet me start by marking the starting position (0,0). Let's consider possible moves:\n\nFrom (0,0), can go down to (1,0) or right to (0,1).\n\nLet me explore the right first. Let's try the right path.\n\nPath 1: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → ... up to (2,8). From there, stuck. So let's try to explore other options from (2,2). From (2,2), can move down if possible. But row 3, column 2 is *. No. So no. From (2,2), can move right to (2,3), etc. Let's try to go further right to (2, 10) (since row 2's column 10 is o). Let's say we go to (2,10). From there, can move down to row 3, column 10. Row 3's column 10 is o (as per earlier parsing). So move down to (3,10). Now at (3,10). From here, can move down to row 4, column 10. Row 4 is all o's, so yes. Now at (4,10). From here, move down to (5,10). Let me check row 5's column 10. Row 5 is \"o*****o*o****\". Columns 6 is o, 7 is *, 8 is o, then columns 9-12 are *. Column 10 is *. So can't move down. So from (4,10), move down to (5,10) is blocked. So from (4,10), can move right to (4,11), (4,12). Let's go to (4,12). Then down to (5,12) is *, no. Up to (3,12) is *, no. So stuck again. Hmm.\n\nFrom (4,10), maybe move left to (4,8), then down? Let's try. From (4,10), move left to (4,8). Then down to (5,8). Row 5's column 8 is o. Yes! So path: (4,10) → (4,8) → (5,8). Now at (5,8). From here, can move down to (6,8). Row 6's column 8 is o. Yes. Then from (6,8), move down to (7,8). Row 7's column 8 is * (as earlier). No. So move up to (5,8) or move left/right. From (6,8), move left to (6,7) is * (row 6's column 7 is *), no. Move left to (6,6) is o? Let me check row 6: column 6 is o. Yes. So from (6,8), move left to (6,7) is blocked, but how to get to (6,6)? Let me see: from (6,8), move left through (6,7) is blocked. So no. How about from (6,8), move up to (5,8), then left to (5,6), then down? Let's see. From (5,8), move left to (5,7) is *, no. Can't. From (5,8), move up to (4,8), then left to (4,6), then down to (5,6). Let's try that.\n\nFrom (5,8), up to (4,8). Then left to (4,6). From there, down to (5,6). Now at (5,6). From here, as before, can move down to (6,6). Now at (6,6). From here, can move left to (6,5) is *, no. But how to proceed? Let me think. From (6,6), move up to (5,6), then left to (5,4)? Let's check. From (5,6), move left to (5,5) is *, no. To (5,4) is *, no. So stuck again. \n\nHmm. This is getting really complex. Maybe I should try to find a path that goes through row 4, column 4, then down. Let me think. How to get to (4,4)? From (0,0), move right to (0,1), (0,2), down to (1,2), down to (2,2), right to (2,4), down to (3,4) is *, no. From (2,4), move right to (2,4) to (2,8), then down to (3,8) is *, no. From (2,4), move down to (3,4) is *, no. So no. How about from (4,0) move right to (4,4). Yes. So if I can get to (4,4), then down to (5,4) is *, no. But if I move down to (5,6) as before.\n\nWait, let me try this: from (4,4), move down to (5,4) is * (blocked). No. So no. Hmm.\n\nMaybe I should try a different starting move. From (0,0), move down to (1,0), then right? Let's see. From (1,0), can move right to (1,1)? No, it's *. So no. Can move down to (2,0), then right. From (2,0), move right to (2,1)? No, it's *. Can move right to (2,2)? Yes, since row 2, column 2 is o. So from (2,0) → (2,2). How? Let me check. From (2,0), move right to (2,1) is *, no. Can't. So no. So this path is blocked. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to find a way to go around the walls. Let me try to look for a path that goes from the start, down to row 2, then right, then down to row 4, then right, and so on.\n\nLet me try: (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0). From (2,0), move right to (2,2) (since (2,1) is *). How? From (2,0), move right to (2,1) is *, no. Can't. So no. So stuck again. \n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to find the path from the end backward. Let's try that.\n\nThe end is at (12,12). To get there, must come from (12,11). Let's check (12,11) is o. From there, (12,11) can come from (12,10), which is o. And so on, back to (12,3), which is *, so can't. So the path to (12,12) must come from (12,11), which comes from (12,10), ..., up to (12,4), which comes from (11,4). As discussed earlier, (11,4) is o. How to get to (11,4)?\n\nFrom (10,4). How to get to (10,4)? From (9,4). From (8,4). From (7,4). From (6,4). From (5,6) as before? Let me see. If I can get to (6,4), then down to (7,4), then down to (8,4), etc.\n\nSo let's focus on reaching (6,4). How?\n\nFrom row 4, column 4, move down to (5,4) is *, no. So no. From row 6, column 0, move right to (6,4). How to get to (6,0)? From earlier steps, if I go down to (4,0), then down to (5,0), then down to (6,0). Yes. So path: (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → down to (3,0) → down to (4,0) → down to (5,0) → down to (6,0). Now at (6,0). From here, move right to (6,4). Let's check row 6's columns 0-4: all o. Yes. So move right to (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). Now at (6,4). From here, move down to (7,4). Row 7, column 4 is o. Yes. Now at (7,4). Move down to (8,4). Row 8, column 4 is o. Yes. Now at (8,4). Move down to (9,4). Row 9, column 4 is o. Yes. Now at (9,4). Move down to (10,4). Row 10, column 4 is o. Yes. Now at (10,4). Move down to (11,4). Row 11, column 4 is o. Yes. Now at (11,4). Move down to (12,4). Row 12, column 4 is o. Yes. Now at (12,4). Move right to (12,5), (12,6), ..., up to (12,12). This should work!\n\nLet me verify each step:\n\nStarting at (0,0).\n\nMove down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → down to (3,0) → down to (4,0) → down to (5,0) → down to (6,0). That's 6 moves down.\n\nFrom (6,0), move right to (6,1) → right to (6,2) → right to (6,3) → right to (6,4). That's 4 moves right.\n\nFrom (6,4), move down to (7,4) → down to (8,4) → down to (9,4) → down to (10,4) → down to (11,4) → down to (12,4). That's 6 moves down.\n\nFrom (12,4), move right to (12,5) → right to (12,6) → right to (12,7) → right to (12,8) → right to (12,9) → right to (12,10) → right to (12,11) → right to (12,12). That's 8 moves right.\n\nSo the total moves would be:\n\ndown, down, down, down, down, down, right, right, right, right, down, down, down, down, down, down, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.\n\nLet me count the number of moves and check if the path is valid.\n\nLet me check each step for validity.\n\nStarting at (0,0):\n\n1. down → (1,0) → valid.\n2. down → (2,0) → valid.\n3. down → (3,0) → valid.\n4. down → (4,0) → valid.\n5. down → (5,0) → valid.\n6. down → (6,0) → valid.\nNow at (6,0).\n\n7. right → (6,1) → valid (row 6 is \"ooooo*o*ooooo\", column 1 is o? Let me parse row 6: columns 0-4 are o, column 5 is *, column 6 is o, column 7 is *, columns 8-12 are o. Yes, (6,1) is o.\n8. right → (6,2) → o.\n9. right → (6,3) → o.\n10. right → (6,4) → o.\nNow at (6,4).\n\n11. down → (7,4). Row 7 is \"o*o*o********\". Column 4 is o. Yes.\n12. down → (8,4). Row 8 is \"o*o*ooooooooo\". Column 4 is o. Yes.\n13. down → (9,4). Row 9 is \"o*o*o*o*****o\". Column 4 is o. Yes.\n14. down → (10,4). Row 10 is \"o*o*o*ooooo*o\". Column 4 is o. Yes.\n15. down → (11,4). Row 11 is \"o***o********\". Column 4 is o. Yes.\n16. down → (12,4). Row 12 is \"ooo*ooooooooX\". Column 4 is o. Yes.\nNow at (12,4).\n\n17. right → (12,5) → o.\n18. right → (12,6) → o.\n19. right → (12,7) → o.\n20. right → (12,8) → o.\n21. right → (12,9) → o.\n22. right → (12,10) → o.\n23. right → (12,11) → o.\n24. right → (12,12) → X. Valid.\n\nYes! This path works. Now, translating these moves into the required list of 'down', 'right', etc.\n\nThe sequence of moves is:\n\n6 'down's, 4 'right's, 6 'down's, 8 'right's.\n\nSo the list would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nLet me count again to make sure:\n\nFrom start to (6,0): 6 downs.\n\nThen 4 rights to (6,4).\n\nThen 6 downs to (12,4).\n\nThen 8 rights to (12,12).\n\nYes, 6+4+6+8 = 24 moves, which matches the list length.\n\nNow, let's verify that there are no walls in this path. For example, when moving from (6,0) to (6,4), each step is right through columns 0-4, which are all o in row 6. Then down steps are through columns 4 in rows 7-12, which are o in those rows. And the final right steps are in row 12, columns 4-12, except column 3 is *, but we're moving from 4 to 12, which are all o except column 3. So yes, it's valid.\n\nTherefore, this path should work.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this maze. The start is 'I' and the end is 'X'. The maze is 13x13, I think. Let me first try to visualize the maze. The input is given as a series of lines. Let me write them down properly.\n\nFirst line: I followed by o's and ending with * and o. Then the next lines have various * and o. Let me try to map out the coordinates. Maybe I should represent the maze as a grid where each cell is accessible or blocked.\n\nFirst, I need to find where 'I' is located. The first line starts with 'I', so row 0, column 0. The destination 'X' is in the last line, probably at row 12, column 12? Let me check the last line: \"o*ooooooooooX\". Let's count the characters. Let's see, for the last line:\n\nAssuming each line is 13 characters long. Let's see:\n\nThe last line: o * o o o o o o o o X. Let's count:\n\n1. o\n2. *\n3. o\n4. o\n5. o\n6. o\n7. o\n8. o\n9. o\n10. o\n11. o\n12. X? Wait, maybe the line is longer. Let me recount. Original line given is \"o*ooooooooooX\". Let's count the characters. Let's break it down:\n\n- o * o o o o o o o o o X. Wait, maybe I'm missing some. Let me count:\n\nOriginal line: o*ooooooooooX. Let's count:\n\no (1), * (2), then 8 o's (from oooooooo?), then X. Wait, maybe it's o* followed by 10 o's and X? Let me see:\n\nOriginal line for the last row is written as \"o*ooooooooooX\". Let's count each character. Let me write it out:\n\nCharacters: o, *, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, X. That's 13 characters. So positions 0 to 12. So the X is at column 12, row 12. So the start is (0,0), end is (12,12).\n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (12,12), moving up, down, left, right, avoiding the * walls.\n\nLet me try to sketch the maze mentally. Let's go row by row.\n\nRow 0: I (0,0) followed by o's until the end? Let me check:\n\nOriginal first line: Ioooooooooo*o. Let's count. Let's see:\n\nI followed by o's and then * and o. Let me count the characters. For row 0:\n\n\"I\" (0,0), then o's. Let's see:\n\n\"Ioooooooooo*o\" — breaking down:\n\nI o o o o o o o o o * o. Let me count:\n\n1. I\n2. o\n3. o\n4. o\n5. o\n6. o\n7. o\n8. o\n9. o\n10. o\n11. *\n12. o\n\nWait, that's 12 characters? Or maybe there are more o's? Let me recount. The exact string is \"Ioooooooooo*o\". Let's count the letters:\n\n\"I\" followed by 9 o's? Because \"ooooooooo\" is 9 o's. Then a *, then an o. So total is 1 + 9 + 1 + 1 = 12? Hmm, maybe the line is 13 characters. Let me check:\n\n\"I\" (1) + \"oooooooooo\" (10 o's?), but the string given is \"Ioooooooooo*o\". Let me count:\n\n\"I\" then \"oooooooooo\" (that's 10 o's?), but between the I and the *? Let me see:\n\nThe first line is written as: I followed by several o's, then a *, then an o. Let me count each character:\n\nAssuming each line is 13 characters. Let me think:\n\nFor example, first line:\n\nI o o o o o o o o o o * o ?\n\nWait, maybe I need to write down each line properly. Let me try to parse each line as a row, and note the positions where there are walls or open spaces.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think of the maze as a grid and find a path step by step. Let me try to find a path.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's see possible moves. From (0,0), can I move right or down?\n\nLooking at row 0. The first line is:\n\nRow 0: [I, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, *, o]\n\nWait, but the line is \"Ioooooooooo*o\". Let me count each character for row 0 (assuming it's 13 characters):\n\nIndex 0: I\n\nThen indexes 1-10: o's? Let me see:\n\n\"I\" followed by 9 o's? Then * and then o? Let's count:\n\n\"I\" (1) + 9 o's (positions 1-9?), then a *, then an o. So total would be 1 + 9 + 1 + 1 = 12. Hmm, perhaps there's a typo here. Maybe the first line is 13 characters. Let me think again. Let's take the first line as:\n\n\"I\" followed by 10 o's, then a *, then an o. That would be 1 + 10 + 1 + 1? No. Wait, maybe the line is \"I\" followed by 9 o's, then a *, then 2 o's? Let me count the letters in the string \"Ioooooooooo*o\". Let's see:\n\n\"I\" + \"oooooooooo\" (10 o's?) but no, \"oooooooooo\" is 9 o's? Wait, \"o\" repeated 9 times is written as \"ooooooooo\". The given string is \"Ioooooooooo*o\"—the part after I is \"oooooooooo\"—which is 10 o's? Let me check:\n\n\"I\" followed by ten o's? Let me count the letters in the string:\n\n\"I\" (1) then o's: o o o o o o o o o o (ten o's), then *, then o. So total is 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 13? No, 1 + 10 (o's) + 1 (*) + 1 (o) = 13. Yes. So row 0 has:\n\nAt positions 0: I (start)\n\npositions 1-10: o's\n\nposition 11: *\n\nposition 12: o\n\nSo from (0,0), moving right is possible until column 10, but column 11 is a wall. So from (0,0), can move right to (0,1), etc. Also, can we move down? Let's check row 1, column 0. The second line is \"o***********o\"—so row 1, column 0 is 'o'? Wait, the second line is \"o***********o\". Let me parse that. Let's count the characters. The line is \"o\" followed by 11 *s and then an o? Let me see:\n\nAssuming the line is o followed by 11 *s and then o? For example, \"o***********o\" would have 1 + 11 + 1 = 13. Yes. So row 1, column 0 is 'o', but columns 1-11 are * (walls), and column 12 is 'o'. So from (0,0), moving down to (1,0) is possible because row 1, column 0 is 'o'.\n\nSo starting at (0,0), possible moves are right or down. Let me think which direction to go. Maybe down first? Because if I go right, I can go up to column 10 (since column 11 is a wall). Let me think of possible paths.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to go down first. Let me try to outline a path.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's try to move down. So from (0,0) down to (1,0). Then, from (1,0), can I move down again? Let's check row 2, column 0. The third line is \"ooooo*ooooooo\"—so row 2, column 0 is 'o'. So yes. So moving down from (1,0) to (2,0). Then again down to (3,0)? Let's check row 3, column 0. The fourth line is \"**o***o*o****\"—so row 3, column 0 is '*', which is a wall. So can't go down here. So from (2,0), can't go down. So perhaps need to move right here.\n\nSo from (2,0), can move right or down? Down is blocked. So move right. Let's see. From (2,0), moving right to (2,1). What's there? The third line is \"ooooo*ooooooo\"—so row 2, columns 0-4 are o's, then a *, then o's. So column 5 is *, so positions 0-4 are o's. So (2,0) can move right up to column 4. Let me think.\n\nSo maybe from (2,0), moving right to column 4. Let me try to find a path. But perhaps this approach is too tedious. Maybe I should use a BFS approach mentally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the path step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the path goes right from the start. Let me try that.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's move right as far as possible. The first line allows moving right until column 10, since column 11 is a wall. Let's say I go all the way to (0,10). Then, what's next? From there, can I move down? Let's check row 1, column 10. The second line is all * except for column 0 and 12. So row 1, column 10 is *, so can't move down there. So perhaps from (0,10), need to move right to (0,11)? But column 11 in row 0 is a wall. So no. So can't. So maybe from (0,10), move down to row 1? Wait, row 1, column 10 is a *, so no. So stuck here. So perhaps going all the way right isn't helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: from (0,0), move down to (1,0), then down to (2,0), then right. Let me try again.\n\nFrom (2,0), moving right to (2,1), then (2,2)... up to (2,4). Let's say I go to (2,4). From there, can I move down? Let's check row 3, column 4. The fourth line is \"**o***o*o****\"—so row 3, column 0 is *, column 1 is *, column 2 is o? Wait, let me parse the fourth line: \"**o***o*o****\".\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nColumns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: o, 6: *, 7: o, then the rest are *? Let me check:\n\nAssuming the line is \"**o***o*o****\"—so:\n\nPositions 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: o, 6: *, 7: o, 8: *, and then *s? Let me count:\n\n**o***o*o**** — let's count the characters:\n\n1. *\n2. *\n3. o\n4. *\n5. *\n6. o\n7. *\n8. o\n9. *\n10. *\n11. *\n12. *\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some. Let me think. The line is \"**o***o*o****\"—so:\n\nBreaking it into parts:\n\n**o***o*o**** — perhaps:\n\nFirst two *s, then o, then three *s, then o, then *, o, then four *s? Let me count:\n\nTotal would be 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 13? Let me check:\n\nYes. So columns:\n\n0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: *, 11: *, 12: * ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The fourth line is \"**o***o*o****\"—each * or o. Let me count each character for row 3 (assuming it's 13 characters):\n\nPosition 0: *\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: *\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: *\n\n11: *\n\n12: *\n\nSo, for example, row 3, column 2 is o. So from (2,0) moving right to (2,2). Let's see. Row 2 is \"ooooo*ooooooo\"—so columns 0-4 are o's, then *, then o's. So (2,4) is *, so can't go there. So from (2,0), moving right to (2,1), (2,2), etc., up to column 4, but column 4 is *? Wait, row 2's line is \"ooooo*ooooooo\"—so let me parse that. Let's see:\n\n\"ooooo*ooooooo\"—so first five o's, then *, then seven o's? Let me count:\n\no o o o o * o o o o o o o — 5 o's, then *, then 7 o's. That's 5+1+7=13. Yes. So row 2, columns 0-4: o, column 5: *, columns 6-12: o's. So (2,4) is o. So from (2,0) can move right to (2,4). Then, from (2,4), can we move down? Row 3, column 4 is * (from earlier analysis of row 3), so no. So need to move right again. From (2,4), moving right to (2,5)? But column 5 is *, so can't. So stuck here. Hmm. So perhaps from (2,4), move right to (2,5) is blocked. So maybe need to move up? No, already at row 2. So perhaps need to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,0), move right to (2,2). Then down to row 3, column 2, which is o. So from (2,2) down to (3,2). Let me check that. Yes, row 3, column 2 is o. So that's possible. Then from (3,2), what can I do? Let's see. Let me try to map this path.\n\nSo path so far:\n\nStart at (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,1) → right to (2,2) → down to (3,2).\n\nFrom (3,2), possible moves: up (back), left (to 3,1?), but row 3, column 1 is * (from earlier analysis). So can't. So from (3,2), can move right or down or up. Let's try moving right. (3,2) → (3,3) is * (row 3, column 3 is *). Can't. So move down? Let's check row 4, column 2. Row 4 is \"ooooooo*ooooo\"—the fifth line is \"ooooooo*ooooo\". Let me parse that. Assuming it's seven o's, then *, then four o's? Let me count:\n\n\"ooooooo*ooooo\" — 7 o's, *, 5 o's? Wait, total 13. 7+1+5=13. Yes. So row 4, column 2 is o. So from (3,2), move down to (4,2). Then from (4,2), can move in various directions. Let's see. From (4,2), moving down? Let's check row 5, column 2. Row 5 is \"o*o*o*******o\". Let me parse that. Let's break it down:\n\no * o * o * * * * * * * o ?\n\nAssuming the fifth line is \"o*o*o*******o\". Let me count characters:\n\n1. o\n2. *\n3. o\n4. *\n5. o\n6. *\n7. *\n8. *\n9. *\n10. *\n11. *\n12. o ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think. The line is o*o*o followed by seven *s and then o? No, total would be 1+1+1+1+1 + 7 + 1 = 13? 5 + 7 +1? Not sure. Let me count the exact line:\n\nOriginal line: \"o*o*o*******o\". Let's count:\n\no * o * o * * * * * * * o — that's 13 characters. So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: *, 9: *, 10: *, 11: *, 12: o. So row 5, column 2 is o. So from (4,2), moving down to (5,2) which is o. Then from (5,2), can I move down? Row 6, column 2. The sixth line is \"o*o*ooo*o*ooo\". Let me parse that. Let me break it into parts:\n\nAssuming the line is o * o * o o o * o * o o o o? Let me count. Original line: \"o*o*ooo*o*ooo\". Let me count each character:\n\n1. o\n2. *\n3. o\n4. *\n5. o\n6. o\n7. o\n8. *\n9. o\n10. *\n11. o\n12. o\n13. o ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think. For row 6 (assuming it's the sixth line, which is \"o*o*ooo*o*ooo\"), the characters are:\n\no * o * o o o * o * o o o — which is 13 characters. So column 2 is o. So row 6, column 2 is o. So from (5,2), moving down to (6,2). Then from (6,2), can move down again? Let's check row 7, column 2. Row 7 is \"o*******o***o\". Let me parse that. Assuming it's o followed by seven *s, then o, then three *s and o? Not sure. Let me count:\n\nOriginal line: \"o*******o***o\". Let's break it down:\n\n1. o\n2. *\n3. *\n4. *\n5. *\n6. *\n7. *\n8. *\n9. *\n10. o\n11. *\n12. *\n13. * — no, the line is 13 characters. Let me recount:\n\no followed by 7 *s (positions 1-7), then o, then three *s, then o? Let me count:\n\no (1), then 7 *s (positions 1-7: 7 characters), then o (position 8), then three *s (positions 9-11), then o (position 12)? That would be 1 +7 +1 +3 +1= 13. Yes. So row 7, column 2 is * (since columns 1-7 are *). So can't move down from (6,2) to (7,2). So from (6,2), need to move in other directions. Let me see. From (6,2), can move up, left, right, or down (but down is blocked). Let's try moving right. From (6,2), moving right to (6,3). What's there? Row 6, column 3 is * (from earlier parsing of row 6: \"o*o*ooo*o*ooo\"). Let me check. For row 6, columns:\n\n0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o, 11: o, 12: o. So column 3 is *, so can't move there. So from (6,2), can move right to (6,3)? No. So perhaps move up? Let me backtrack. Maybe this path isn't working. Let me think of alternative routes.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,2), instead of going down, maybe move right. Let me see. From (4,2), row 4, column 2 is o. Moving right to (4,3), (4,4), etc. Let's check row 4's line: \"ooooooo*ooooo\"—so columns 0-6 are o's, column 7 is *, columns 8-12 are o's. So from (4,2), moving right up to column 6. Let's say I go to (4,6). Then down? Let's check row 5, column 6. Row 5's line: \"o*o*o*******o\"—columns 5-11 are *s. So row 5, column 6 is *, so can't move down. So perhaps move right to column 7? But that's *, no. So maybe move up?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let's try to find a path by using BFS or DFS in my mind.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to go right from the start, then down when possible. Let me try again.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's move right to (0,1), then (0,2)... up to (0,10). From there, can we move down? Let me check row 1, column 10. The second line is \"o***********o\"—columns 0 is o, columns 1-11 are *, column 12 is o. So column 10 is *, so can't move down. So stuck. So maybe from (0,10), move right to (0,11), but that's a wall. So no. So perhaps from (0,9), move down? Let's check row 1, column 9 is *. No. So no. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the path requires going around the walls. For example, go down to row 2, then right, then down again. Let me try again.\n\nFrom (0,0) down to (1,0), then down to (2,0). From (2,0), move right to (2,4) (since row 2 allows up to column 4). Then down is blocked, so move right to (2,5) is blocked (it's *). So need to move up? No. So perhaps move right to (2,4), then right to (2,5) no. So maybe move right to (2,4), then down is blocked. So from (2,4), move right to (2,5) no. So maybe move up to (1,4)? But row 1, column 4 is * (row 1 is all * except 0 and 12). So no. So stuck again. Hmm.\n\nMaybe I need to find another way. Let me check other parts of the maze.\n\nLooking at the third line (row 2): \"ooooo*ooooooo\"—so columns 0-4 are o, column 5 is *, then columns 6-12 are o. So perhaps from row 2, column 6 onwards are open. Maybe from (2,6) onwards. How to get there? From (2,4), can't move right because column 5 is *. So need to go down to row 3, column 4 is blocked. Wait, but row 3, column 2 is o. So maybe from (2,2) down to (3,2), then right to (3, ...). Let me try that again.\n\nPath so far:\n\n(0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,2) → down to (3,2). From (3,2), move right to (3,3)? No, that's *. So move right to (3,2) → can move right to (3, 2+1=3? No. Let me check row 3 again. Row 3: columns 0 and 1 are *, column 2 is o, columns 3 and 4 are *, column 5 is o, column 6 is *, column 7 is o, then *s. So from (3,2), can move right to (3,5)? How? Need to go through columns that are open. From (3,2), moving right to (3,3) is *, blocked. So can't. So need to move down to row 4, column 2. From (3,2) down to (4,2). Row 4, column 2 is o. Then from (4,2), move right to (4,3), (4,4), etc. Row 4 is \"ooooooo*ooooo\"—so columns 0-6 are o's. So from (4,2), move right to (4,6). Then down to row 5, column 6? Let's check row 5, column 6. Row 5's line is \"o*o*o*******o\"—columns 5-11 are *s. So column 6 is *, can't move down. So from (4,6), move down is blocked. So move right to (4,7)? But row 4, column 7 is *, since row 4's line has * at column 7. Wait, row 4's line is \"ooooooo*ooooo\"—so columns 0-6 are o, column 7 is *, columns 8-12 are o. So from (4,6), moving right to (4,7) is *, blocked. So can't. So move up? From (4,6), up to (3,6). Let me check row 3, column 6. Earlier analysis said row 3, column 5 is o, column 6 is *? Let me recheck row 3's line: \"**o***o*o****\"—columns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: o, 6: *, 7: o, ... So yes, column 6 is *. So (3,6) is *. Can't move there. So stuck again. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different starting direction. Let's try moving right from the start for a bit, then down when possible.\n\nFrom (0,0) move right to (0,1), then right again to (0,2), ..., up to (0,10). From there, can't go further right. Now, from (0,10), can I move down? Let's check row 1, column 10. Row 1 is \"o***********o\"—columns 0 is o, columns 1-11 are *, column 12 is o. So column 10 is *, so can't move down. So from (0,10), move down is blocked. What about moving right to (0,11)? No, it's a wall. So stuck. So perhaps from (0,9), move down? Let's check row 1, column 9: it's *, so no. Same for earlier columns. So this path isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe go down to row 2, then right to column 5 (which is blocked by *), but how? Not helpful.\n\nLet me think of other possible paths. Maybe from the start, move down to row 2, then right to column 4, then down to row 3, but that's blocked. Wait, row 3, column 4 is *.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,4), move right to (2,5) is blocked. So from (2,4), move up to (1,4) which is *, no. Or left. Hmm.\n\nMaybe I need to find a way to go around the walls in row 1. Since row 1 has * from column 1 to 11, except column 0 and 12. So to get from column 0 to column 12 in row 1, you have to go through the ends. But maybe that's not helpful. Let me think.\n\nPerhaps the path goes down to row 2, then right to column 6, then down to row 3, column 6? Let me check row 3, column 6. Earlier analysis said it's *.\n\nHmm. Let me try to find a path from (2,0) to somewhere else. From (2,0), move right to (2,5) is blocked at column 5. So up to column 4. From (2,4), can I move down to row 3, column 4? No, it's *. So no. From (2,4), move up to row 1, column 4: which is *.\n\nThis seems like a dead end. Maybe there's a different approach. Let me check the maze again for possible open paths.\n\nLooking at the tenth line (row 9): \"o***o*******o\". Let me parse it. It might have some open paths. Similarly, other rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the path goes through the right side of the maze. For example, from the start, move right to (0,11) is blocked, but (0,12) is o? Let me check row 0's line: ends with o. Yes, row 0, column 12 is o. So from (0,0), can I move right all the way to (0,12)? Let me check the first line again. The first line is \"Ioooooooooo*o\"—so column 11 is *, column 12 is o. So yes! From (0,0), moving right to column 12 is possible. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nRow 0: columns 0 (I), 1-10 are o, 11 is *, 12 is o. So from (0,0), move right to (0,1), (0,2), ..., (0,10), then can't move to (0,11) because it's *, but (0,12) is o. So how to get to (0,12)? From (0,10), move down? Let me check row 1, column 10 is *, so no. From (0,10), move right is blocked. Wait, how can (0,12) be accessible? Only if there's a way to get there from the left. Oh, maybe from (0,11) is blocked, but how to get to (0,12)? Only if you can move down to some row and come back. But initially, from (0,0), you can't reach (0,12) directly. Wait, unless there's a mistake in my parsing. Let me recheck the first line.\n\nOriginal first line: \"Ioooooooooo*o\"—so after the I, there are 10 o's? Let me count the o's:\n\n\"I\" followed by \"oooooooooo\" (which is 10 o's?), then a *, then an o. So total length is 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 13? Yes. So columns 0: I, 1-10: o, 11: *, 12: o. So (0,12) is o. So how to get there? From (0,10), can't move right to 11 (blocked), but can I move down to row 1, column 10 (which is *), no. So no. So how to get to (0,12)? Maybe from somewhere else. For example, if there's a way to reach (0,12) from below. Let's say from row 1, column 12 is o. So from row 1, column 12, move up to (0,12). But how to get to row 1, column 12?\n\nRow 1 is \"o***********o\"—so column 12 is o. So to get to (1,12), need to move right from (1,11), but column 11 is *. Or from (1,12) is already the end of the row. How to get there? From (1,11) is *, no. So perhaps from (2,12)? Let me check row 2's line: \"ooooo*ooooooo\"—column 12 is o. So from (2,12), move up to (1,12), then up to (0,12). But how to get to (2,12)? Let's see.\n\nFrom row 2, column 5 is *, but columns 6-12 are o. So if I can get to (2,6), then move right to (2,12). How to get to (2,6)? From (2,0), move right to (2,4), then right to (2,5) is blocked. So no. So this seems like a dead end.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let me try to look for other possible paths. Let's think about the end point at (12,12). Let me see what's around it. The last line is \"o*ooooooooooX\"—so column 12 is X. The previous columns: column 0 is o, column 1 is *, column 2 is o, etc. So to get to (12,12), perhaps coming from the left or above.\n\nLet me try to work backward from the end. Starting at (12,12). What cells can reach it? From (12,11), if it's o. Let me check row 12's line: \"o*ooooooooooX\". Let's parse it. Assuming row 12 is the last line. Let me count:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o, 11: o, 12: X. So (12,11) is o. So to get to (12,12), you can come from (12,11) (right move). Or from (11,12), if it's o. Let me check row 11, column 12. Row 11 is \"o*o**********\" or something? Let me check the eleventh line: \"o*o**********\". Original input for row 11 is \"o*o**********\". Let me parse it. Let's assume it's o, *, o, followed by 10 *s? Let me count: o * o * * * * * * * * * * — 13 characters. So column 12 is *. So can't come from (11,12). So from (12,12), previous step is (12,11). Let's look at (12,11). What can reach it? From (12,10), right move, or from (11,11), down move. Let's check row 11, column 11: row 11 is \"o*o**********\"—columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, then all * from 3 to 12. So column 11 is *. So can't come from (11,11). So from (12,11), previous step is (12,10). And so on. Let me try to trace backward.\n\nPath from end:\n\n(12,12) ← (12,11) ← (12,10) ← ... ← (12,2). Because row 12, columns 2-11 are o's. So from (12,2) to (12,11) is possible by moving right. Now, how to get to (12,2)? From above, like (11,2). Let's check row 11, column 2 is o. Row 11 is \"o*o**********\"—columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, then all *s. So yes. So from (11,2), down to (12,2). Now, how to get to (11,2)? Let's see. From (10,2), down. Let me check row 10's line: \"ooo*ooooooo*o\". Let me parse it. Assuming it's ooo* followed by oooooo*o. Let me count: row 10 is \"ooo*ooooooo*o\". So columns 0-2: o, column 3: *, columns 4-10: o, column 11: *, column 12: o. So column 2 is o. So from (10,2), move down to (11,2). How to get to (10,2)? From (10,2), possible previous steps could be up, left, right, or down. Let's say from (9,2), down to (10,2). Let me check row 9's line: \"o***o*******o\". Let me parse it. Assuming it's o***o followed by seven *s and o. Let me count: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, then *s up to column 11, and o at 12. So column 2 is *, so can't come from (9,2). So how to get to (10,2)? Maybe from the right. Let's see. From (10,3)? But column 3 is *, no. From (10,1)? Column 1 is o? Let me check row 10's line: \"ooo*ooooooo*o\"—columns 0-2: o, column 3: *, so column 1 is o. So (10,1) is o. From there, move right to (10,2). How to get to (10,1)? Let's see. From (9,1), down. Row 9, column 1 is * (from earlier parsing), so no. From (10,0), right to (10,1). Let me check row 10, column 0: o. So yes. From (10,0), move right to (10,1). How to get to (10,0)? Let's see. From (9,0), down. Row 9, column 0 is o. Let me check row 9's line: starts with o. Yes. So from (9,0), down to (10,0). How to get to (9,0)? From (8,0), down. Let me check row 8's line: \"ooooooooooo*o\"—assuming it's o's up to column 11, then * and o? Wait, the ninth line (assuming rows are 0-based) is the tenth input line. Let me clarify: the maze has 13 rows. Let me recheck the input lines:\n\nThe input lines provided are:\n\nLine 0: Ioooooooooo*o\n\nLine 1: o***********o\n\nLine 2: ooooo*ooooooo\n\nLine 3: **o***o*o****\n\nLine 4: ooooooo*ooooo\n\nLine 5: o*o*o*******o\n\nLine 6: o*o*ooo*o*ooo\n\nLine 7: o*******o***o\n\nLine 8: ooooooooooo*o\n\nLine 9: o***o*******o\n\nLine 10: ooo*ooooooo*o\n\nLine 11: o*o**********\n\nLine 12: o*ooooooooooX\n\nSo row 9 is \"o***o*******o\"—so columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, then *s up to column 11, and o at 12. So (9,0) is o. To get to (9,0), from (8,0), down. Row 8 is \"ooooooooooo*o\"—so column 0 is o. So from (8,0), down to (9,0). How to get to (8,0)? From (7,0), down. Row 7 is \"o*******o***o\"—column 0 is o. Yes. From (7,0), down to (8,0). How to get to (7,0)? From (6,0), down. Row 6 is \"o*o*ooo*o*ooo\"—column 0 is o. Yes. From (6,0), down to (7,0). How to get to (6,0)? From (5,0), down. Row 5 is \"o*o*o*******o\"—column 0 is o. Yes. From (5,0), down to (6,0). How to get to (5,0)? From (4,0), down. Row 4 is \"ooooooo*ooooo\"—column 0 is o. Yes. From (4,0), down to (5,0). How to get to (4,0)? From (3,0), down. Row 3 is \"**o***o*o****\"—column 0 is *, so no. Can't come from there. So need to find another way to get to (4,0). How?\n\nFrom (4,0), possible previous steps could be up, left, right, or down. But down is from (3,0) which is blocked. Up is (3,0) which is blocked. Left is invalid. Right: from (4,1). Let me check row 4, column 1 is o (since row 4 is \"ooooooo*ooooo\"—columns 0-6 are o). So from (4,1), move left to (4,0). How to get to (4,1)? From (3,1), down. Row 3, column 1 is * (row 3 is \"**o***o*o****\"—columns 0 and 1 are *), so no. From (4,1), how to get there? Maybe from (4,2), left. Let me see. From (4,2), move left to (4,1). How to get to (4,2)? From (3,2), down. Row 3, column 2 is o. Yes. From (3,2), down to (4,2). How to get to (3,2)? From (2,2), down. Row 2, column 2 is o. Yes. From (2,2), down to (3,2). How to get to (2,2)? From (2,0), moving right to (2,2). Yes! So this forms a path.\n\nLet me outline this path backward:\n\nFrom (12,12) ← (12,11) ← ... ← (12,2) ← (11,2) ← (10,2) ← (10,1) ← (10,0) ← (9,0) ← (8,0) ← (7,0) ← (6,0) ← (5,0) ← (4,0) ← (4,1) ← (4,2) ← (3,2) ← (2,2) ← (2,0) ← (2,0) is part of earlier steps.\n\nBut how to get to (2,2)? From (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → right to (2,2). Yes!\n\nSo putting it all together, the path from start to (2,2) is:\n\nStart at (0,0) → down, down → right, right.\n\nThen from (2,2), down to (3,2), down to (4,2), left to (4,1), left to (4,0)... and so on.\n\nNow, let's try to translate this into move directions.\n\nLet me map out the steps:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\n1. Move down to (1,0): 'down'\n\n2. Move down to (2,0): 'down'\n\n3. Move right to (2,1): 'right'\n\n4. Move right to (2,2): 'right'\n\nThen:\n\n5. Move down to (3,2): 'down'\n\n6. Move down to (4,2): 'down'\n\n7. Move left to (4,1): 'left'\n\n8. Move left to (4,0): 'left'\n\nNow, from (4,0), how to get to (5,0)? Move down: 'down'\n\n9. down\n\nFrom (5,0) to (6,0): down\n\n10. down\n\nFrom (6,0) to (7,0): down\n\n11. down\n\nFrom (7,0) to (8,0): down\n\n12. down\n\nFrom (8,0) to (9,0): down\n\n13. down\n\nFrom (9,0) to (10,0): down\n\n14. down\n\nFrom (10,0) to (10,1): right\n\n15. right\n\nFrom (10,1) to (10,2): right\n\n16. right\n\nNow, from (10,2), move up? No, need to get to (11,2). Wait, how?\n\nWait, earlier in the backward path, from (10,2) move down to (11,2). So from (10,2), move down.\n\n17. down to (11,2)\n\nThen from (11,2), move down to (12,2): down\n\n18. down\n\nFrom (12,2), move right to (12,3), ..., up to (12,11), then to (12,12).\n\nSo from (12,2), need to move right 9 times (from 2 to 11 is 9 steps? 11-2=9, but to get from 2 to 12, it's 10 steps. Wait, from column 2 to 12 is 10 steps right. Let me count:\n\nColumns 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12: that's 10 moves right.\n\nSo steps 19 to 28: ten 'right' moves.\n\nBut let me check if there are any obstacles in row 12 from column 2 to 12. The last row is \"o*ooooooooooX\". So columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, ..., 12: X. So from column 2 to 12, all are o's except column 1. So yes, can move right 10 times.\n\nSo compiling all these moves:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', ... (ten rights)].\n\nWait, let me count again the steps:\n\nSteps 1-4: down, down, right, right.\n\nSteps 5-6: down, down.\n\nSteps 7-8: left, left.\n\nSteps 9-14: down (from 4,0 to 9,0: 5 downs? Let me recheck.\n\nFrom (4,0) to (5,0): down (step 9)\n\n(5,0) → (6,0): down (10)\n\n(6,0) → (7,0): down (11)\n\n(7,0) → (8,0): down (12)\n\n(8,0) → (9,0): down (13)\n\n(9,0) → (10,0): down (14)\n\nSo that's steps 9-14: 6 moves.\n\nThen step 15: right from (10,0) to (10,1)\n\nStep 16: right to (10,2)\n\nStep 17: down to (11,2)\n\nStep 18: down to (12,2)\n\nThen steps 19-28: ten rights to reach (12,12).\n\nSo total moves:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right'].\n\nWait, let me count the number of moves after step 18:\n\nFrom (12,2) to (12,12): 10 rights.\n\nSo the full list would be:\n\n1. down\n\n2. down\n\n3. right\n\n4. right\n\n5. down\n\n6. down\n\n7. left\n\n8. left\n\n9. down\n\n10. down\n\n11. down\n\n12. down\n\n13. down\n\n14. down\n\n15. right\n\n16. right\n\n17. down\n\n18. down\n\nThen ten rights: 19-28.\n\nLet me verify if this path is valid.\n\nLet me simulate the positions:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nAfter 1. down → (1,0)\n\nAfter 2. down → (2,0)\n\nAfter 3. right → (2,1)\n\nAfter 4. right → (2,2)\n\nAfter 5. down → (3,2)\n\nAfter 6. down → (4,2)\n\nAfter 7. left → (4,1)\n\nAfter 8. left → (4,0)\n\nAfter 9. down → (5,0)\n\nAfter 10. down → (6,0)\n\nAfter 11. down → (7,0)\n\nAfter 12. down → (8,0)\n\nAfter 13. down → (9,0)\n\nAfter 14. down → (10,0)\n\nAfter 15. right → (10,1)\n\nAfter 16. right → (10,2)\n\nAfter 17. down → (11,2)\n\nAfter 18. down → (12,2)\n\nNow, from (12,2), moving right 10 times:\n\n(12,3), (12,4), ..., (12,12). Yes.\n\nNow, check if all these positions are valid.\n\nCheck for each step:\n\nAt (4,0): row 4, column 0 is o.\n\nYes.\n\nAt (5,0): row 5, column 0 is o.\n\nYes.\n\nAt (6,0): row 6, column 0 is o.\n\nYes.\n\nAt (7,0): row 7, column 0 is o.\n\nYes.\n\nAt (8,0): row 8, column 0 is o.\n\nYes.\n\nAt (9,0): row 9, column 0 is o.\n\nYes.\n\nAt (10,0): row 10, column 0 is o.\n\nYes.\n\nAt (10,1): row 10, column 1 is o? Row 10 is \"ooo*ooooooo*o\"—columns 0-2 are o, column 3 is *, so yes, (10,1) is o.\n\nAt (10,2): o.\n\nThen down to (11,2): row 11, column 2 is o.\n\nYes.\n\nDown to (12,2): o.\n\nYes.\n\nThen moving right to 12,12: all o's.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this path is valid!\n\nNow, let's convert the moves into the required list.\n\nThe moves are:\n\n['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right'].\n\nWait, after step 18 (down to (12,2)), there are 10 'right' moves. So from step 19 to 28: 10 'right's.\n\nLet me count the total moves:\n\nSteps 1-18: 18 moves.\n\nPlus 10 rights: total 28 moves.\n\nBut let me check the exact sequence.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to output the list of moves. Let me write it out:\n\nAnswer: ['down','down','right','right','down','down','left','left','down','down','down','down','down','down','right','right','down','down','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right']\n\nBut let me count again the number of 'right's after step 18. From (12,2) to (12,12) requires moving right 10 times. Let's see:\n\nStarting at column 2, moving to column 3 (1), 4 (2), 5 (3), 6 (4), 7 (5), 8 (6), 9 (7), 10 (8), 11 (9), 12 (10). Yes, 10 moves.\n\nSo the list is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path, but given the time I've spent, this seems valid.\n\nNow, let me check if any of the moves go through walls.\n\nFor example, when moving left from (4,2) to (4,1) and (4,0): those positions are valid.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother check: from (2,0) to (2,2): two rights, valid.\n\nYes.\n\nFrom (3,2) down to (4,2): valid.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be a valid path.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','right','right','down','down','left','left','down','down','down','down','down','down','right','right','down','down','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right']"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find a path from the start point 'I' to the destination 'X' in this maze. The maze is 13x13 based on the given lines. Let me first try to visualize the maze.\n\nStarting with the first row: I followed by o's and ending with a * and o. So the start is at position (0,0). The destination 'X' is at the end of the last row. Let me note down the positions of 'I' and 'X' first.\n\nNow, I need to figure out a path. Since the maze is a bit complex, maybe I should use a BFS (Breadth-First Search) approach to find the shortest path. But since I'm doing this manually, I need to track possible moves step by step.\n\nLet me start by mapping the maze. Let me write down each row as a list of characters. But maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can think of coordinates. Let's assume rows are numbered from 0 to 12 (since 13 rows) and columns 0 to 12 as well.\n\nStart is at (0,0). Let me check adjacent cells. From (0,0), possible moves: right (since (0,1) is 'o'), down (row 1, column 0: looking at the second line, first character is 'o', so (1,0) is 'o' which is passable.\n\nBut I need to avoid walls (*). Let me try to sketch a possible path.\n\nStarting at (0,0). Let's try moving right first. But maybe there's a better way. Let me think. Since the maze has a lot of walls, perhaps the path goes down first. Let me try:\n\nFrom (0,0) down to (1,0). Then check possible directions. Let me think about each step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right as much as possible first. Let me check the first row: \"Ioooooooooo*o\". So after the 'I' (position 0,0), positions 0,1 to 0,10 are 'o's except the last two which are * and o. Wait, the first line is I followed by 10 o's? Let me count:\n\nOriginal line: Ioooooooooo*o. Let's count the characters. Let me see: I (1) followed by 10 o's? Let me count:\n\n\"I o o o o o o o o o o * o\" → that's 1 + 10 o's? Wait, maybe more. Let me count:\n\nOriginal line: \"Ioooooooooo*o\" — Let me count the letters. Let's break it down:\n\nI o o o o o o o o o o * o → that's 1 + 10 o's? Wait:\n\nI is 1, then \"oooooooooo\" is 10 o's? Then * and o. So total length is 1+10+1+1=13? Yes, since it's a 13x13 maze. So row 0 is:\n\npositions 0: I, 1-10: o's (positions 1-10?), then position 11 is *, position 12 is o. Wait, but maybe the first row is:\n\nindex 0: I, index 1: o, index 2: o, ..., index 10: o, index 11: *, index 12: o. So from (0,0), moving right to (0,1) is allowed. But moving all the way to the right might hit a wall at position 11. So maybe the first row allows moving up to column 10 (index 10), then column 11 is *, which is a wall.\n\nSo starting at (0,0), possible directions: right or down.\n\nLet me try to explore possible paths. Since it's a maze, maybe there's a unique path. Let me try to use BFS approach mentally.\n\nLet me mark visited positions to avoid cycles. So starting at (0,0). Let's consider possible moves.\n\nFrom (0,0):\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Right to (0,1)\n- Down to (1,0)\n\nLet me explore both options.\n\nFirst path: Down to (1,0). Let's check row 1 (second line) is \"o***o*******o\". So position (1,0) is 'o' which is okay. Now from (1,0), possible moves:\n\nUp is back to (0,0) — already visited.\n\nDown to (2,0): check row 2, column 0. Row 2 is \"ooo*o*ooooooo\". So first character is 'o', so (2,0) is o. So can move down.\n\nAlternatively, right to (1,1): row 1's column 1 is *, since the line is o***o... So (1,0) → right to (1,1) is a wall. So can't move right here. So from (1,0), possible moves are down.\n\nSo path so far: down from (0,0) to (1,0). Then down to (2,0). Let's continue.\n\nFrom (2,0), possible moves: up (back to 1,0), down (to 3,0), left (invalid, column 0), right (to 2,1 which is o in row 2: \"ooo*o*ooooooo\". So columns 0-2 are o's. So (2,1) is o. So from (2,0), can move right to (2,1).\n\nLet me think if going down further is better. Let's try moving down again. From (2,0) down to (3,0). Check row 3, column 0. Row 3 is \"o*o***o*****o\". First character is o. So (3,0) is o. So move down.\n\nPath so far: down, down, down. Now at (3,0). From here, possible moves: up (to 2,0), down (to 4,0). Let me check row 4, column 0. Row 4 is \"o*ooooooooo*o\". First character is o. So (4,0) is o. So down again.\n\nNow at (4,0). Continue down to (5,0). Row 5: \"o*o***o*o*o*o\". First character o. So yes. Then down to (5,0). From here, down to (6,0). Row 6 starts with o? Let me check row 6: \"o*****o*o****\". First character is o. So yes. Down to (6,0). From there down to (7,0). Row 7: \"oooooo*o*ooooo\". First character o? Wait row 7? Let me check the original list again. The rows given are:\n\nRow 0: Ioooooooooo*o\nRow 1: o***o*******o\nRow 2: ooo*o*ooooooo\nRow 3: o*o***o*****o\nRow 4: o*ooooooooo*o\nRow 5: o*o***o*o*o*o\nRow 6: o*ooo*o*o*o*o\nRow 7: o*****o*o****\nRow 8: ooooo*o*ooooo\nRow 9: o***o***o*o*o\nRow 10: ooo*ooo*o*o*o\nRow 11: **o*o*****o*o\nRow 12: ooo*ooo*ooo*X\n\nSo row 7 is \"o*****o*o****\". First character is o. So (7,0) is o. So moving down to (7,0). Then down to (8,0). Row 8 starts with 'o'? Yes. So (8,0) is o. Continue down to (9,0). Row 9 starts with o? Row 9: \"o***o***o*o*o\". First character o. Then down to (10,0). Row 10 starts with o? Yes. Then down to (11,0). Row 11 starts with **... So row 11's first two characters are *, so (11,0) is *, which is a wall. Can't move there. So from (10,0), down is blocked. So need to backtrack.\n\nSo from (10,0), can't go down. Let's check other directions. From (10,0), possible moves: up (to 9,0), or right. Let me check. From (10,0), right to (10,1). Row 10 is \"ooo*ooo*o*o*o\". So column 1 is o. So can move right. But this might be a way to proceed. But perhaps I need to find a different path earlier. Because going straight down from start leads to a dead end at row 10, column 0. So maybe that path isn't the right one. Let me backtrack.\n\nLet me think again. Starting from (0,0). Maybe moving right first is better. Let me try that.\n\nFrom (0,0), move right to (0,1). Now at (0,1). From here, possible directions: left (back), right, up (invalid, row 0), down.\n\nLet me try moving right as much as possible. Let's see. The first row allows movement until column 10 (since column 11 is *). So maybe go all the way right to (0,10), then check if there's a way down.\n\nBut let me check if that's possible. From (0,0) moving right 10 times to (0,10). Then down. Let's check row 0, column 10 is o. Then down to row 1, column 10. What is that cell? Row 1 is \"o***o*******o\". Let me count column 10. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: o * * * o * * * * * * o ?\n\nWait, the row is \"o***o*******o\". Let's break it down:\n\nPosition 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, then followed by *******o. So positions 5-11 are *, and position 12 is o. So column 10 of row 1 is *? Because from position 4 (o) then positions 5-11 are *s. So yes. So from (0,10), moving down to (1,10) would be a * (wall). So can't go down. So need another way.\n\nSo maybe from (0,1), instead of going all the way right, perhaps go down at some point. Let me try again. From (0,1), maybe move down.\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart at (0,0) → right to (0,1). Then down to (1,1). What's row 1, column 1? It's * (as per row 1: o***o...). So can't move there. So that's a wall. So from (0,1), down to (1,1) is blocked. So need to move right again. From (0,1) → right to (0,2). Then down? Row 1, column 2 is * again. Still blocked. Similarly for (0,3) → down to (1,3)? Let's check row 1, column 3 is *? Yes. Only at column 4 in row 1 is o. So from (0,4), moving down to (1,4). Let me try that path.\n\nSo path would be: from (0,0) → right four times to (0,4). Then down to (1,4). Let's check if that's possible. Yes, because (0,4) is o. Then down to (1,4) which is o (row 1's column 4 is o).\n\nNow at (1,4). Let's see possible directions. From here, maybe move down again. Let me check row 2, column 4. Row 2 is \"ooo*o*ooooooo\". Let's split it. First three o's, then *, then o, *? Let me parse the row:\n\nRow 2: ooo*o*ooooooo. Let's index columns 0-12:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: o, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o, 11: o, 12: o. So column 4 is o. So yes, from (1,4) down to (2,4). Now at (2,4). From here, can I go down again? Row 3, column 4: row 3 is \"o*o***o*****o\". Let's check column 4. Let's parse:\n\nRow 3: o * o * * * o * * * * * o ?\n\nBreaking down:\n\nPosition 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, then ... So column 4 is *? So from (2,4), down to (3,4) is a wall. Can't go there. So need to move in another direction.\n\nFrom (2,4), possible directions: up (to 1,4), left, right, down (blocked). Let's check. Maybe move right. Column 5 is * (as per row 2's column 5 is *). So can't. Move left to (2,3). Column 3 is * (row 2's column 3 is *). So blocked. So can't move left or right. So need to move up or other directions. Wait, maybe move up? But that's back to (1,4). Alternatively, maybe move left until possible. Wait, no. So this is a dead end? How did I get here? From (2,4), stuck. So maybe the path from (0,0) to (0,4) down isn't helpful here. Need to backtrack again.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another way. Let's think again. Maybe the path requires a combination of moves. Let me try to look for the destination 'X' which is at the end of row 12. Let me check row 12: \"ooo*ooo*ooo*X\". So columns 0-12. The X is at column 12, row 12. So need to reach (12,12).\n\nLooking at the maze, perhaps there's a path that snakes through the rows. Let me try to find a possible path by looking for passable cells.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's try to find the positions of 'I' and 'X' and think of possible routes. Maybe the path goes through the right side, or left side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a systematic approach. Let me try to simulate BFS.\n\nStart at (0,0). Mark as visited. Queue: [(0,0, path)].\n\nFor each position, check all four directions. Let me try to do this step by step.\n\nInitial queue: (0,0, [])\n\nDequeue (0,0). Check neighbors:\n\nUp: invalid (row 0). Down: (1,0). Right: (0,1). Left: invalid.\n\nAdd these to queue, with path appended.\n\nSo queue now has:\n\n[(1,0, ['down']), (0,1, ['right'])]\n\nMark (0,0) as visited.\n\nNow process (1,0). Check neighbors:\n\nUp: (0,0) visited. Down: (2,0). Right: (1,1) is * (wall). Left: invalid.\n\nAdd (2,0, ['down', 'down']).\n\nQueue now has [(0,1, ['right']), (2,0, ['down', 'down'])]\n\nProcess (0,1). Neighbors:\n\nUp: no. Down: (1,1) is wall. Right: (0,2). Left: (0,0) visited.\n\nAdd (0,2, ['right', 'right']).\n\nQueue now has [(2,0, ...), (0,2, ...)]\n\nContinue this way... but this is going to take a while manually. Maybe I can look for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to find a possible path by looking at the maze.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\nRow 0: starts with I and has a lot of open space until column 11 (wall). Maybe there's a way to go right, then down, then right again.\n\nLooking at row 1: o***o*******o. So column 0 is o, then three *s, then o at column 4, then all *s until column 11, then o at column 12.\n\nRow 2: ooo*o*ooooooo. Columns 0-2 are o, then *, column 4 o, *, then o's.\n\nRow 3: o*o***o*****o. Column 0 o, * at 1, o at 2, then ***, o at 6, then *s.\n\nRow 4: o*ooooooooo*o. Column 0 o, * at 1, then o's up to column 10 (then * at 11, o at 12).\n\nRow 5: o*o***o*o*o*o. Similar pattern.\n\nMaybe there's a path that goes down from row 0 to row 4, then right.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nFrom (0,0), move down to (1,0), then down to (2,0), then down to (3,0), down to (4,0). From there, move right. Row 4, column 0 is o, and row 4 has from column 1 (which is *), but column 2 is o? Let me check row 4: \"o*ooooooooo*o\". So column 0 is o, column 1 is *, column 2 is o? Let me parse:\n\nRow 4: o * o o o o o o o o * o. So yes, columns 2-9 are o's, column 10 is o, column 11 is *, column 12 is o.\n\nSo from (4,0), can move right to (4,1)? No, column 1 is *. Can't. So need to move further down? Or find a way to move right from (4,0). Wait, no. From (4,0), right is column 1 which is blocked. So need to move down again?\n\nFrom (4,0) down to (5,0). Row 5, column 0 is o. Then down to (6,0). Row 6, column 0 is o. Then down to (7,0). Row 7, column 0 is o. Down to (8,0). Row 8, column 0 is o. Down to (9,0). Row 9, column 0 is o. Down to (10,0). Row 10, column 0 is o. Down to (11,0). Which is * (row 11 starts with **...). So can't. So stuck again.\n\nHmm. This suggests that going straight down from the start leads to a dead end. So maybe need to find a way to go right earlier.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's look for the destination X at (12,12). Let me see what the surrounding rows look like.\n\nRow 12: ooo*ooo*ooo*X. So to reach (12,12), need to come from (12,11), which is o. Let's check row 11, column 12. Row 11 ends with o*o. Wait, row 11 is \"**o*o*****o*o\". Let me check column 12 of row 11: it's o? Let me parse the row:\n\nRow 11: **o*o*****o*o. Assuming it's 13 characters. Let me count:\n\nColumns 0: *, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: *, 9: o, 10: *, 11: o, 12: o? Or maybe different. It's a bit hard to parse. But the last character is o, since the row ends with o*o? Or maybe the row is \"**o*o*****o*o\", which would be:\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nRow 11: [*, *, o, *, o, *, *, *, *, *, o, *, o]. Wait, that's 12 characters. Maybe I'm miscounting. Let me think again. The given row is \"**o*o*****o*o\". Let me count the characters:\n\n- **o*o*****o*o → let's count:\n\n1. *\n2. *\n3. o\n4. *\n5. o\n6. *\n7. *\n8. *\n9. *\n10. *\n11. o\n12. *\n13. o → yes, 13 characters. So column 12 of row 11 is o. So to get to (12,12), from (12,11) which is o, or from (11,12) which is o. Let me check row 12's column 11: it's *? Row 12 is \"ooo*ooo*ooo*X\". Let's parse:\n\nColumns 0-3: ooo*, then ooo*ooo*ooo*X. Let me split it:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o, 11: *, 12: o, 13: X? Wait, no, it's 13 columns (0-12). Let me re-express:\n\nRow 12: positions 0-12:\n\nAssuming the string is \"ooo*ooo*ooo*X\", but since it's length 13, the X is at position 12. Let's break it:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o, 11: *, 12: X. So to reach X at (12,12), need to come from (12,11) which is * (blocked), or from (11,12) which is o (row 11, column 12 is o). So from (11,12), can move down to (12,12). So need to reach (11,12).\n\nNow, how to get to (11,12). Let's look at row 11, column 12 is o. Let's see what's above it. Row 10, column 12: let's check row 10 is \"ooo*ooo*o*o*o\". Let me parse row 10:\n\nAssuming it's \"ooo*ooo*o*o*o\", which would have o's and *s. Let me check column 12 of row 10: since it's 13 characters, let's break it down. Let me think of it as:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o, 11: *, 12: o. So row 10, column 12 is o. So from (10,12), can move down to (11,12), then to X.\n\nSo how to get to (10,12)? Let's look at row 10, column 12 is o. To get there, perhaps from row 9, column 12.\n\nRow 9: \"o***o***o*o*o\". Let's check column 12. Assuming it's o? Let me parse:\n\nRow 9: o***o***o*o*o. Let's split:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: o, 11: *, 12: o. So yes, column 12 is o. So from (9,12), down to (10,12), then to (11,12), then X.\n\nSo need to reach (9,12). Let's check row 9, column 12 is o. How to get there?\n\nLooking at row 9, column 12: perhaps from row 8, column 12.\n\nRow 8: \"ooooo*o*ooooo\". Let's check column 12: o. So from (8,12), down to (9,12).\n\nTo get to (8,12), perhaps from row 7, column 12. Row 7 is \"o*****o*o****\". Let me check column 12: it's *? Let me parse row 7: o followed by five *s, then o, *, o, then four *s. So column 12 is *? Let me think:\n\nRow 7: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: *, 7: o, 8: *, 9: o, 10: ?, let me re-express. Original row 7: \"o*****o*o****\" → length 13.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nPosition 0: o\n\nPositions 1-6: * (six *s?), but let's count:\n\no followed by five *s? Or more? Let me count the string:\n\n\"o*****o*o****\" → o, then five *s (making 1+5=6), then o, *, o, then four *s. Total length: 1+5+1+1+1+4= 13. Yes.\n\nSo columns:\n\n0: o\n\n1-5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9-12: * * * *\n\nSo column 12 is *. So can't move down from row 7, column 12 to row 8. So need another way to reach (8,12). Let's look at row 8, column 12 is o. How to get there? Maybe from the left in row 8.\n\nRow 8: \"ooooo*o*ooooo\". Let's parse it as:\n\nColumns 0-4: o's, column 5: *, column 6: o, column 7: *, columns 8-12: o's. So from column 8 to 12 are o's. So to reach (8,12), can move right from (8,8) to (8,12). How to get to row 8?\n\nMaybe from row 7, moving down at some point. For example, if there's a path to row 7, column 8 (which is o?), then down to row 8, column 8.\n\nRow 7, column 8: let's check. Row 7's column 8 is o? From earlier parsing: row 7, column 8 is o (position 8: yes, since after the *s up to position 6, then o at 6, * at 7, o at 8. So yes. So if I can reach (7,8), then down to (8,8), then right to (8,12), then down to (9,12), etc.\n\nSo how to get to (7,8)? Let's think about row 7. Let me see what's around there.\n\nRow 7: columns 0-12 as discussed. Let's think of moving to (7,8). How to get there? Perhaps from row 6, column 8.\n\nRow 6: \"o*ooo*o*o*o*o\". Let me parse it: o * o o o * o * o * o * o. Let me check column 8. Let's break it down:\n\nRow 6: o * o o o * o * o * o * o.\n\nColumns:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: o\n\n4: o\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: o\n\n11: *\n\n12: o\n\nYes. So column 8 is o. So from (6,8), down to (7,8). How to get to (6,8)?\n\nFrom row 5, column 8? Let's check row 5: \"o*o***o*o*o*o\". Let's parse it. Let me think:\n\nRow 5: o * o * * * o * o * o * o.\n\nColumns:\n\n0: o\n\n1: *\n\n2: o\n\n3: *\n\n4: *\n\n5: *\n\n6: o\n\n7: *\n\n8: o\n\n9: *\n\n10: o\n\n11: *\n\n12: o\n\nYes. So column 8 is o. So from (5,8), down to (6,8). How to get to (5,8)?\n\nFrom row 4, column 8. Row 4: \"o*ooooooooo*o\". Columns 0: o, 1: *, then columns 2-10 are o's, column 11: *, column 12: o. So column 8 is o. From (4,8), down to (5,8). How to get to (4,8)?\n\nFrom row 3, column 8. Row 3: \"o*o***o*****o\". Let me parse it. Columns:\n\n0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, then columns 7-11: *s, column 12: o.\n\nSo column 8 is *. Can't move there. So need another way to reach (4,8). Maybe from the left or right in row 4.\n\nRow 4, column 8 is o. Let's say I'm at (4,8). How to get there? From row 4, moving left or right from some position.\n\nLet me think: perhaps from row 4, column 0, move right to column 8? But earlier attempts showed that row 4, column 1 is *, blocking movement. So from (4,0), can't move right. So need to find another way to reach row 4, column 8.\n\nMaybe from row 3, column 6 (which is o), down to row 4, column 6, then right to column 8.\n\nRow 3, column 6 is o. How to get there?\n\nRow 3: \"o*o***o*****o\". Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: *, 5: *, 6: o, ... So column 6 is o. Let's say I can reach (3,6). Then down to (4,6), then right to (4,8).\n\nHow to get to (3,6)? Let's look at row 3. From row 2, column 2 (which is o?), down to row 3, column 2 (o?), then right?\n\nRow 2: \"ooo*o*ooooooo\". Columns 0-2: o's, column 3: *, column 4: o, column 5: *, then o's. So from (2,2), down to (3,2). Row 3, column 2 is o. Then from (3,2), move right to (3,6)? Let's see:\n\nFrom (3,2) → right to (3,3) is *, can't. So need to find a way around.\n\nRow 3: from column 2 (o), need to get to column 6 (o). Let me check what's between. Columns 2 is o, column 3 is *, column 4 is *, column 5 is *, column 6 is o. So there's a wall between 2 and 6. Can't move directly. So need to go up or down?\n\nFrom (3,2), can I move up to row 2, column 2? Yes, but that's where I came from. Not helpful. Or down to row 4, column 2? Row 4, column 2 is o. Let me check: row 4 is \"o*ooooooooo*o\". Column 2 is o. So from (3,2), down to (4,2). Then what?\n\nAt (4,2), which is o. Now, row 4 has columns 1 as *, but columns 2-10 are o's. So from (4,2), move right to (4,6), then to (4,8). Yes. So path would be:\n\n(3,2) → down to (4,2) → right to (4,6) → right to (4,8).\n\nSo how to get to (3,2)? From row 2, column 2. How to get there?\n\nFrom row 2, column 2, which is o. Let's think how to get there. Let's say I'm coming from row 0, moving down and right.\n\nLet me recap the path so far:\n\nStart at (0,0) → down to (1,0) → down to (2,0) → down to (3,0) → down to (4,0). From there, can't move right because of *, but if I can get to (4,2), then move right.\n\nBut how to get from (4,0) to (4,2)? From (4,0), move right to (4,1) is *, blocked. So need to find another way. Maybe from row 3, column 0 up to row 4, column 0?\n\nWait, I'm at (4,0). How to get to (4,2)? Maybe from row 3, column 0 → right to (3,2), then down to (4,2). Let's see:\n\nFrom (3,0) → right to (3,2). How to get to (3,0)? From earlier path, starting from (0,0) down to (3,0). Yes. So:\n\nPath: (0,0) → down → down → down → (3,0). From there, move right to (3,2). Then down to (4,2). Then right to (4,6), then to (4,8). Then down to (5,8), then down to (6,8), down to (7,8), down to (8,8). Then right to (8,12). Down to (9,12), down to (10,12), down to (11,12), then down to (12,12).\n\nThis seems possible. Let me verify each step.\n\nStarting from (0,0):\n\n1. Down to (1,0)\n2. Down to (2,0)\n3. Down to (3,0)\n4. Right to (3,1): but row 3, column 1 is *? Yes. Can't. So need to move right from (3,0) to (3,1) is blocked. Wait, row 3, column 0 is o, column 1 is *.\n\nSo from (3,0), can't move right to (3,1). How to get to (3,2)? Need to find a way around the * at column 1.\n\nMaybe from (3,0), move up to (2,0), then right? Let's think:\n\nAt (3,0), move up to (2,0). From there, move right to (2,1) which is o (row 2, column 1 is o? No, row 2 is \"ooo*o*ooooooo\". Columns 0-2 are o's, column 3 is *. So (2,1) is o. So from (2,0), move right to (2,1), then right to (2,2). Then down to (3,2).\n\nYes! So here's the path:\n\nFrom (3,0) → up to (2,0) → right to (2,1) → right to (2,2) → down to (3,2).\n\nSo adding these steps to the path:\n\nAfter step 3 (at (3,0)):\n\n4. up → (2,0)\n5. right → (2,1)\n6. right → (2,2)\n7. down → (3,2)\n\nNow at (3,2). Then down to (4,2):\n\n8. down → (4,2)\n\nFrom (4,2), move right to (4,6):\n\n9. right → (4,3)\n10. right → (4,4)\n11. right → (4,5)\n12. right → (4,6)\n\nWait, but between (4,2) and (4,6), there are no walls. Row 4 is \"o*ooooooooo*o\". Columns 2 is o, columns 3-10 are o's. So yes, can move right three times to reach (4,6).\n\nThen from (4,6) move right two more times to (4,8):\n\n13. right → (4,7)\n14. right → (4,8)\n\nNow at (4,8). Down to (5,8):\n\n15. down → (5,8)\n\nDown to (6,8):\n\n16. down → (6,8)\n\nDown to (7,8):\n\n17. down → (7,8)\n\nDown to (8,8):\n\n18. down → (8,8)\n\nNow at (8,8). Need to move right to (8,12). Let's see how many steps: from column 8 to 12 is 4 steps right.\n\n19. right → (8,9)\n20. right → (8,10)\n21. right → (8,11)\n22. right → (8,12)\n\nNow at (8,12). Down to (9,12):\n\n23. down → (9,12)\n\nDown to (10,12):\n\n24. down → (10,12)\n\nDown to (11,12):\n\n25. down → (11,12)\n\nFinally, down to (12,12):\n\n26. down → (12,12)\n\nThis seems to work. Now let me check if all these moves are valid.\n\nLet me verify some key points:\n\n- From (3,0) up to (2,0): valid.\n- From (2,0) right to (2,1): valid (row 2, column 1 is o).\n- From (2,1) right to (2,2): valid (row 2, column 2 is o).\n- Down to (3,2): valid (row 3, column 2 is o).\n- Down to (4,2): valid.\n- Moving right to (4,6): valid.\n- Down steps to row 8: each down move is valid as the columns in those rows are o.\n- Moving right in row 8 from 8 to 12: row 8 is \"ooooo*o*ooooo\" → columns 8-12 are o's? Earlier parsing said row 8: columns 0-4 are o's, column 5 is *, column 6 is o, column 7 is *, columns 8-12 are o's. Yes. So moving right from (8,8) to (8,12) is valid.\n- Down steps to (12,12): each down move is valid as the cells are o.\n\nNow, let's compile all the moves:\n\nThe initial moves from (0,0) to (3,0) are three 'down's.\n\nThen up, right, right, down, etc.\n\nLet me list all the moves in order:\n\n1. down (from 0,0 to 1,0)\n2. down (to 2,0)\n3. down (to 3,0)\n4. up (to 2,0)\nWait, no: step 4 is up from (3,0) to (2,0). But the initial three downs take us to step 3 at (3,0). Then step 4 is up.\n\nSo the sequence of moves is:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n1. down\n2. down\n3. down → now at (3,0)\n4. up → (2,0)\n5. right → (2,1)\n6. right → (2,2)\n7. down → (3,2)\n8. down → (4,2)\n9. right → (4,3)\n10. right → (4,4)\n11. right → (4,5)\n12. right → (4,6)\n13. right → (4,7)\n14. right → (4,8)\n15. down → (5,8)\n16. down → (6,8)\n17. down → (7,8)\n18. down → (8,8)\n19. right → (8,9)\n20. right → (8,10)\n21. right → (8,11)\n22. right → (8,12)\n23. down → (9,12)\n24. down → (10,12)\n25. down → (11,12)\n26. down → (12,12)\n\nSo the moves are:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']\n\nWait, let's count the number of moves between each step:\n\nFrom step 1-3: three downs.\n\nStep 4: up.\n\nSteps 5-6: two rights.\n\nStep 7: down.\n\nSteps 8: down.\n\nSteps 9-14: six rights (from 4,2 to 4,8: columns 2 to 8 is 6 steps right? Let me see: from (4,2) to (4,8) requires 6 moves right (columns 2→3→4→5→6→7→8, which is 6 moves). But in my earlier breakdown, I had steps 9-14 as six moves: steps 9-14 are 6 moves (from 9 to 14 is 6 steps). Yes.\n\nThen steps 15-18: four downs.\n\nThen steps 19-22: four rights.\n\nThen steps 23-26: four downs.\n\nSo the list of moves is:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']\n\nBut wait, from (4,2) to (4,8) requires 6 'right' moves (columns 2→3, 3→4, 4→5, 5→6, 6→7, 7→8). So steps 9-14: six 'right's.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,8) to (8,12): four 'right's (columns 8→9, 9→10, 10→11, 11→12).\n\nSo the total moves are:\n\ndown, down, down, up, right, right, down, down, right, right, right, right, right, right, down, down, down, down, right, right, right, right, down, down, down, down.\n\nLet me count the total number of moves: 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 4 = let's see:\n\nFirst part: 3 downs, 1 up, 2 rights, 1 down, 1 down → that's 3+1+2+2= 8?\n\nWait, perhaps better to just list them all:\n\n1. down\n2. down\n3. down\n4. up\n5. right\n6. right\n7. down\n8. down\n9. right\n10. right\n11. right\n12. right\n13. right\n14. right\n15. down\n16. down\n17. down\n18. down\n19. right\n20. right\n21. right\n22. right\n23. down\n24. down\n25. down\n26. down\n\nYes, 26 moves. Now, I need to make sure that each of these moves is valid and that the path doesn't hit any walls.\n\nLet me verify a few critical points:\n\n- After step 4 (up to (2,0)), steps 5-6: right to (2,1) and (2,2): valid.\n- Step 7: down to (3,2): valid.\n- Steps 8: down to (4,2): valid.\n- Steps 9-14: moving right from (4,2) to (4,8): valid since row 4 has no walls between columns 2 and 8.\n- Steps 15-18: down to row 8: each down move is valid because columns 8 in those rows are o.\n- Steps 19-22: right to (8,12): valid.\n- Steps 23-26: down to (12,12): valid.\n\nThis seems to work. Now, I need to convert this sequence of moves into the required list format.\n\nThe answer would be:\n\n['down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']\n\nBut let me check if there's a shorter path or if I made any errors in the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more optimal path, but given the complexity of the maze, this seems plausible. Let me check if any of the steps are invalid.\n\nFor example, when moving down from (7,8) to (8,8): row 7, column 8 is o (as discussed earlier), and row 8, column 8 is o. Valid.\n\nYes. All steps seem valid.\n\nThus, the final answer should be this list of moves.\n ;Answer: ['down','down','down','up','right','right','down','down','right','right','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down']"

      "Okay, let's try to solve this maze. First, I need to understand the structure of the maze. The user provided a 13x13 grid (since there are 13 lines each with 13 characters). The starting point is 'I', and the destination is 'X'. The task is to find a path from 'I' to 'X' using the allowed moves: up, down, left, right. \n\nFirst, I should probably map out the maze to visualize it better. Let me start by figuring out where the start and end points are. \n\nLooking at the first line: \"Ioooooooooooo\". So the first row starts with 'I' followed by 12 'o's. That means the starting position is at (0,0) if we consider rows and columns starting at 0. \n\nThe end point 'X' is in the last row, which is the 13th line. Let's check the last line: \"o*o***o*****o*X\". Wait, counting the characters, maybe I need to check each line's length. Let me count the characters in each line. For example, the first line is 13 characters. The last line: let's see, maybe it's 13 as well. The 'X' is at the end? Let me check. The last line ends with 'X', so maybe the X is at column 12 (if 0-based) of row 12. \n\nNow, the challenge is to find a path from (0,0) to (12,12), moving only through 'o's and avoiding '*'s. \n\nI think the best approach here is to perform a BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the shortest path. But since the user wants a list of moves, I need to track the path taken. Alternatively, I can simulate moving step by step, keeping track of visited positions to avoid cycles. \n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Parse the maze into a 2D grid.\n2. Find the start position (I) and end position (X).\n3. Use BFS to find the shortest path from start to end.\n4. Convert the path coordinates into a list of directions (up, down, left, right).\n\nFirst, let me note down the positions of 'I' and 'X'. \n\nStart is at row 0, column 0. \n\nEnd is in row 12. Let me check each line to find where X is. The last line (row 12) is: \n\n\"o*o***o*****o*X\"\n\nLet me count each character. Let's see:\n\nPositions 0 to 12:\n\n0: o\n1: *\n2: o\n3: *\n4: *\n5: o\n6: *\n7: *\n8: *\n9: *\n10: o\n11: *\n12: X\n\nWait, but that would make the X at column 12? Wait, the line is \"o*o***o*****o*X\". Let me count the characters again. Let me write them out:\n\nIndices 0-12:\n\n0: o\n1: *\n2: o\n3: *\n4: *\n5: o\n6: *\n7: *\n8: *\n9: *\n10: o\n11: *\n12: X?\n\nWait, the line ends with \"o*X\". Let me check again. The line is \"o*o***o*****o*X\". Let me split it:\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\no * o * * * o * * * * * o * X ?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me count again. Let's take the 13th line (assuming rows are 0 to 12):\n\nOriginal input lines:\n\nMaze Board:\nLine 0: Ioooooooooooo\nLine 1: o***o*o*o****\nLine 2: ooo*o*o*ooo*o\nLine 3: o***o***o***o\nLine 4: o*ooooo*ooooo\nLine 5: o*********o*o\nLine 6: ooo*ooooo*o*o\nLine 7: o*o*o*****o*o\nLine 8: o*ooooooo*o*o\nLine 9: o***o*****o*o\nLine 10: o*ooooooo*o*o\nLine 11: o*o***o***o*o\nLine 12: o*o***o*****o*X ?\n\nWait, the last line provided by the user is:\n\n\"o*o***o*****o*X\"\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check how many characters that is. Let's count:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\no * o * * * o * * * * * o * X \n\nLet me count each character:\n\no (1), * (2), o (3), * (4), * (5), * (6), o (7), * (8), * (9), * (10), * (11), o (12), * (13)? Wait, but each line should be 13 characters. Wait, the line is written as \"o*o***o*****o*X\". Let me count:\n\no * o * * * o * * * * * o * X → Let's count:\n\n1. o\n2. *\n3. o\n4. *\n5. *\n6. *\n7. o\n8. *\n9. *\n10. *\n11. *\n12. *\n13. o\n14. * → Wait, this can't be. There's a mistake here. Wait, the user provided the maze as 13 lines each of 13 characters. Let me check again. The user wrote:\n\nMaze Board:\nIoooooooooooo (13 chars)\no***o*o*o**** (13)\nooo*o*o*ooo*o (13)\no***o***o***o (13)\no*ooooo*ooooo (13)\no*********o*o (13)\nooo*ooooo*o*o (13)\no*o*o*****o*o (13)\no*ooooooo*o*o (13)\no***o*****o*o (13)\no*ooooooo*o*o (13)\no*o***o***o*o (13)\no*ooo*ooo*o*X (13?)\n\nWait, the last line is \"o*ooo*ooo*o*X\". Let me count the characters here. Let's see:\n\nEach character:\n\no * o o o * o o o * o o o * X ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's take the last line as given: \"o*ooo*ooo*o*X\". Let's count each character:\n\nAssuming that the line is 13 characters long. Let me write it out:\n\nPositions 0-12:\n\n0: o\n1: *\n2: o\n3: o\n4: o\n5: *\n6: o\n7: o\n8: o\n9: *\n10: o\n11: o\n12: o\nWait, but the line ends with *X. Wait, perhaps the line is \"o*ooo*ooo*o*X\", which would be:\n\nBreaking down:\n\no * o o o * o o o * o o X ?\n\nNo, that's 12 characters. Hmm, maybe there's a typo. But the user said it's an n*n maze, so all lines must be the same length. Let me check the first line: \"Ioooooooooooo\" has 1 (I) + 12 o's → 13 characters. So each line is 13 characters. Let me check the last line again. The user wrote:\n\n\"o*ooo*ooo*o*X\"\n\nLet me count the characters:\n\no * o o o * o o o * o o o * X → that's 15? No, perhaps I need to count properly. Let's write it as:\n\nAssuming the line is written as \"o*ooo*ooo*o*X\". Let's split into individual characters:\n\n1. o\n2. *\n3. o\n4. o\n5. o\n6. *\n7. o\n8. o\n9. o\n10. *\n11. o\n12. o\n13. o\nWait, but then there's a * and X. Wait, maybe the line is \"o*ooo*ooo*o*X\" which would be:\n\no * o o o * o o o * o o X ?\n\nNo, that's 13 characters? Let me count:\n\no (1), * (2), o (3), o (4), o (5), * (6), o (7), o (8), o (9), * (10), o (11), o (12), X (13). Oh! So the line is \"o*ooo*o oo*oX\"? Wait, maybe the last part is \"*oX\"? Let me check again. The line is written as \"o*ooo*ooo*o*X\". Let me count each character:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- o\n- *\n- o\n- o\n- o\n- *\n- o\n- o\n- o\n- *\n- o\n- *\n- X\n\nYes, that's 13 characters. So the X is at position (12, 12) (row 12, column 12). Let's confirm:\n\nRow 12 (assuming rows are 0-based) is the last line. The X is at column 12. \n\nSo the destination is at (12, 12).\n\nNow, the starting position is (0,0). \n\nNow, I need to find a path from (0,0) to (12,12). Let me try to visualize the maze.\n\nBut since I can't draw here, I need to think step by step.\n\nLet me try to perform BFS manually. \n\nBFS starts at (0,0). From there, possible moves are right and down (since up and left would be out of bounds). Let me check the adjacent cells.\n\nBut first, I need to know the positions of walls. Let me note down some parts of the maze.\n\nRow 0: I (0,0) followed by o's. So columns 0 to 12: (0,0) is I, (0,1) is o, (0,2) o, etc. All the way to (0,12) is o.\n\nRow 1: o***o*o*o**** → Let's parse row 1 (row index 1):\n\nPositions 0: o, 1: *, 2: *, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: *, 10: *, 11: *, 12: *.\n\nSo row 1 has walls (stars) in columns 1-3, 5,7,9-12. \n\nSo, for example, from (0,0), moving down to (1,0) is allowed because row 1, column 0 is 'o'. \n\nSo initial BFS steps:\n\nStart at (0,0). \n\nCheck possible directions:\n\n- Down (to (1,0)): allowed since row 1, column 0 is 'o'.\n\n- Right (to (0,1)): allowed since it's 'o'.\n\nSo BFS queue starts with these positions. \n\nBut since I need to track the path, perhaps I can simulate the BFS step by step, keeping track of visited positions.\n\nAlternatively, since doing this manually for a 13x13 maze is error-prone, perhaps I can look for a possible path.\n\nLet me try to find a path step by step.\n\nStarting at (0,0). \n\nLet me think about possible directions. Maybe first move down as much as possible? Or right? Let's see.\n\nFrom (0,0), moving right to (0,1) is possible. But maybe moving down first is better to avoid getting stuck in some areas. \n\nLet me try moving down first. \n\n(0,0) → down to (1,0). \n\nNow at (1,0). From here, possible moves:\n\n- Down to (2,0): check row 2, column 0. Row 2 is \"ooo*o*o*ooo*o\". So first three characters are o, o, o. So (2,0) is o. So allowed. \n\nSo moving down again to (2,0). \n\nThen again down to (3,0). Row 3, column 0: row 3 is \"o***o***o***o\", so column 0 is o. So allowed. \n\nThen down to (4,0). Row 4: \"o*ooooo*ooooo\". Column 0 is o. \n\nSo down to (4,0). \n\nThen down to (5,0). Row 5: \"o*********o*o\". Column 0 is o. \n\nDown to (5,0). Now, from here, row 5 has a lot of stars. Let me check row 5: \n\nRow 5 is o followed by 11 stars, then o, *, o. Wait, the exact line is \"o*********o*o\". So columns 0: o, 1-10: *, 11: o, 12: * o? Let me parse it properly. \n\nAssuming the line is \"o*********o*o\". Let's count the *s. Starting with o, then 9 *? Let me see:\n\no followed by 11 *? Let me check. For 13 characters:\n\no * * * * * * * * * * * o * o → No. Wait, perhaps the line is o followed by 9 stars, then o, *, o? Let me think. Let's take the line as:\n\no*********o*o → Breaking it down:\n\no followed by 9 * (positions 1-9), then o (position 10), * (11), o (12). So yes. \n\nSo in row 5, column 0 is o, columns 1-9 are *, column 10 is o, 11 is *, 12 is o. \n\nSo from (5,0), possible moves: \n\n- Down to (6,0): row 6, column 0. Row 6 is \"ooo*ooooo*o*o\". First three o's. So (6,0) is o. \n\nSo moving down again. \n\nAt (6,0). From here, can we move down again? \n\nRow 7: \"o*o*o*****o*o\". Column 0: o? Let's check. The line starts with o? Let me parse row 7: \"o*o*o*****o*o\". Yes, first character is o. So (7,0) is o. \n\nSo down again to (7,0). \n\nRow 8: \"o*ooooooo*o*o\". First character is o. So down to (8,0). \n\nRow 9: \"o***o*****o*o\". First character is o. Down to (9,0). \n\nRow 10: \"o*ooooooo*o*o\". First character is o. Down to (10,0). \n\nRow 11: \"o*o***o***o*o\". First character is o. Down to (11,0). \n\nRow 12: \"o*ooo*ooo*o*X\". First character is o. Down to (12,0). \n\nNow at (12,0). From here, need to reach (12,12). Let's see. \n\nAt (12,0), can we move right? Let's check the row 12. \n\nRow 12 is: o * o o o * o o o * o * X. Wait, earlier analysis said the X is at (12,12). So let's check each column in row 12:\n\nColumns 0: o\n1: *\n2: o\n3: o\n4: o\n5: *\n6: o\n7: o\n8: o\n9: *\n10: o\n11: *\n12: X\n\nSo from (12,0), can we move right? Let's see. \n\nAt (12,0), right to (12,1) is *, which is a wall. So no. \n\nSo stuck here. This path leads to dead end. So going straight down from start leads to dead end. \n\nHmm. So maybe that path isn't viable. Need to backtrack. \n\nLet me think where else I could have gone. Let's retrace steps. \n\nStarting again. From (0,0), moving down to (1,0), then down to (2,0)... up to (12,0). Dead end. So perhaps there's a better path earlier. \n\nAlternative approach: from (0,0), move right instead of down. Let's try that. \n\n(0,0) → right to (0,1). \n\nNow at (0,1). From here, possible moves: \n\n- Right (to (0,2)), down (to (1,1)). \n\nBut row 1, column 1 is * (as per row 1's description). So down to (1,1) is blocked. \n\nSo from (0,1), can move right or down. But down is blocked. So only right. \n\nSo moving right to (0,2), (0,3)... all the way to (0,12)? \n\nBut let's check row 1. For example, if I go right all the way along row 0, then maybe from (0,12), can I move down? \n\nRow 0, column 12 is o. \n\nFrom (0,12), moving down to (1,12). Let's check row 1's column 12: row 1 is \"o***o*o*o****\", which ends with ****. So column 12 is *. So can't move down. \n\nSo from (0,12), can't move down. So maybe this path isn't helpful. \n\nHmm. Maybe combining right and down moves. \n\nAlternative idea: from (0,0), move down to (1,0), then right? Let's try again.\n\nStart at (0,0). Down to (1,0). \n\nAt (1,0), possible moves: down to (2,0), or right to (1,1). But (1,1) is * (row 1's column 1 is *). So can't move right. So only down. \n\nSo down to (2,0). \n\nAt (2,0), row 2 is \"ooo*o*o*ooo*o\". So columns 0-2 are o. So can move right here. \n\nFrom (2,0), maybe move right to (2,1), then (2,2), etc. Let's try that. \n\n(2,0) → right to (2,1). \n\nNow at (2,1). Check if it's o. Row 2: columns 0-2 are o. So yes. \n\nFrom (2,1), can move right again to (2,2), then perhaps down? \n\nBut let's think of possible paths. Maybe from here, moving right to (2,3) is blocked because row 2's column 3 is *? Let me check row 2 again. \n\nRow 2: \"ooo*o*o*ooo*o\". Let's parse each column:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: o, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, 5: *, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o, 9: o, 10: o, 11: *, 12: o. \n\nSo from (2,0), moving right to (2,1), (2,2), then at column 3 it's a *, so can't go further right. \n\nSo from (2,2), can't move to column 3. So perhaps from (2,1), move down. \n\nAt (2,1), moving down to (3,1). \n\nRow 3 is \"o***o***o***o\". Let's check column 1: row 3's column 1 is *. So can't move there. \n\nSo stuck. \n\nHmm. Backtrack again. \n\nAlternative path: from (2,0), instead of moving right, move down again. \n\nFrom (2,0) down to (3,0). \n\nRow 3, column 0 is o. \n\nFrom (3,0), can move down to (4,0), which is o. \n\nThen down to (5,0), etc., as before, leading to dead end. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternative approach: maybe find a path that goes around the walls. Let me think of possible corridors. \n\nLooking at row 0, all o's. So maybe moving right along row 0 to a point where I can go down into a passable area. \n\nFor example, from (0,0), move right to (0,4), then down to row 1, column 4. Let's check row 1, column 4. \n\nRow 1: columns 0 is o, then columns 1-3 are *, column 4 is o. So yes, (1,4) is o. \n\nSo possible path: \n\n(0,0) → right to (0,4), then down to (1,4). \n\nLet me try this. \n\nStart at (0,0). \n\nRight to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4). \n\nAt (0,4), move down to (1,4). \n\nNow at (1,4). From here, possible moves: \n\n- Down to (2,4). Check row 2, column 4: o (as per earlier parsing of row 2). \n\nYes. \n\nSo down to (2,4). \n\nNow at (2,4). \n\nRow 2, column 4 is o. \n\nPossible moves: \n\n- Down to (3,4). Let's check row 3, column 4. Row 3 is \"o***o***o***o\". Columns 0: o, then 1-3: *, column 4: o. So yes. \n\nSo down to (3,4). \n\nNow at (3,4). \n\nPossible moves: \n\n- Down to (4,4). Row 4, column 4: o*ooooo*ooooo. Let me check row 4. \n\nRow 4: \"o*ooooo*ooooo\". Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, etc. So column 4 is o (since columns 2-6 are o's? Let me parse it:\n\nRow 4: o * o o o o o * o o o o o. Wait, let me break it down:\n\nAssuming the line is o*ooooo*ooooo. So:\n\n0: o\n1: *\n2: o\n3: o\n4: o\n5: o\n6: o\n7: *\n8: o\n9: o\n10: o\n11: o\n12: o\n\nYes. So column 4 is o. \n\nSo down to (4,4). \n\nAt (4,4), possible moves: \n\n- Down to (5,4). Check row 5, column 4. Row 5 is \"o*********o*o\". Columns 0: o, then 1-10: *, column 10: o, 11: *, 12: o. So column 4 is *, which is a wall. Can't move down. \n\nSo from (4,4), can't move down. So need to move elsewhere. \n\nPossible directions: left, right, up, or down (but down is blocked). \n\nLet me check. \n\nFrom (4,4), can move:\n\n- Right: to (4,5). Row 4, column 5 is o. \n\nYes. \n\nSo move right to (4,5). \n\nNow at (4,5). \n\nPossible moves: \n\n- Right to (4,6). Also o. \n\nContinue right to (4,6), (4,7). Wait, row 4's column 7 is *? No, row 4's column 7 is *, according to earlier parsing. Wait, row 4 is o*ooooo*ooooo. The * is at column 7. So from (4,5), moving right to (4,6): o, then (4,7) is *. So can't go further. \n\nSo from (4,5), can move down? Let's check row 5, column 5. It's a * (since row 5 has * from 1-10). So can't move down. \n\nSo from (4,5), can move up? To (3,5). \n\nRow 3, column 5: \"o***o***o***o\". Let's check column 5. \n\nRow 3: columns 0: o, 1-3: *, column 4: o, then columns 5: *, 6: *, 7: *, column 8: o, etc. Wait, original row 3 is \"o***o***o***o\". Breaking it down:\n\no * * * o * * * o * * * o \n\nSo for columns 0-12:\n\n0: o\n1: *\n2: *\n3: *\n4: o\n5: *\n6: *\n7: *\n8: o\n9: *\n10: *\n11: *\n12: o \n\nSo column 5 is *, so can't move up from (4,5) to (3,5). \n\nHmm. So stuck here. \n\nAlternative direction from (4,4): move left. \n\nFrom (4,4), left to (4,3). Row 4, column 3 is o. \n\nYes. \n\nAt (4,3). \n\nPossible moves: \n\n- Left to (4,2), (4,1), etc. \n\nBut perhaps moving up? \n\nFrom (4,3), up to (3,3). Which is * (row 3, column 3 is *). Can't. \n\nLeft to (4,3-1= (4,2): o. \n\nSo move left to (4,2). \n\nNow at (4,2). \n\nPossible moves: \n\n- Left to (4,1): row 4, column 1 is *. Can't. \n\nSo move up to (3,2): row 3, column 2 is * (row 3's columns 1-3 are *). Can't. \n\nMove down to (5,2): row 5, column 2. Row 5 is \"o*********o*o\". Columns 1-10 are *, so column 2 is *. Can't. \n\nMove right back to (4,3). \n\nStuck again. \n\nHmm. So this path isn't working. \n\nLet me think of another approach. Maybe there's a corridor in the middle. \n\nLooking back at row 4, columns 2-6 are o's (since row 4 is o*ooooo*ooooo). So from (4,2) to (4,6), except column 7 is *. \n\nBut earlier attempts to navigate there hit dead ends. \n\nAlternative idea: from (4,4), move left to (4,3), then up to (3,3) is blocked. But maybe from (4,2), move up to (3,2) is blocked. \n\nAlternative path: perhaps from (3,4), move right to (3,8). Let me check. \n\nAt (3,4), which is o. Row 3 has columns 4: o, then columns 5-7: *, then column 8: o. So from (3,4), can move right to (3,8) by passing through columns 5-7? No, because those are *s. So can't. \n\nSo stuck. \n\nAlternative idea: Let's go back to earlier steps. \n\nFrom (2,4), which is in row 2, column 4. Maybe move right to (2,4+1=5). But row 2, column 5 is * (as per row 2's structure: columns 4 is o, 5 is *). So can't. \n\nSo from (2,4), can move down to (3,4), which we did. \n\nHmm. Maybe there's another way. \n\nLet me think about row 4, column 8. Since row 4's column 7 is *, but column 8 is o. How to get there? \n\nPerhaps from row 3, column 8. \n\nRow 3, column 8 is o. So if I can get to (3,8), then down to (4,8). \n\nHow to get to (3,8)? \n\nLooking at row 3: columns 8 is o. Let's see how to reach there. \n\nFrom row 2, column 8 is o (row 2's columns: ..., column 8 is o). \n\nSo from row 2, column 8, can move down to (3,8). \n\nHow to get to (2,8)? \n\nFrom row 2, let's think. \n\nRow 2 is \"ooo*o*o*ooo*o\". Columns 0-2: o, column 3: *, column 4: o, column 5: *, column 6: o, column 7: *, column 8: o, columns 9-11: o, *, column 12: o. \n\nSo from row 2, column 8 is o. To get there, maybe from row 2, column 6. \n\nFor example, from (2,6), move right to (2,7) is blocked (column 7 is *), so no. \n\nAlternatively, from (2,4), move right to (2,5) is blocked. \n\nHmm. How to reach (2,8)? \n\nMaybe from above. Like row 1, column 8. \n\nRow 1, column 8 is o. Let me check row 1: \"o***o*o*o****\". Columns 0: o, 1-3: *, column 4: o, 5: *, column 6: o, 7: *, column 8: o, 9: *, and the rest are *s. Yes. \n\nSo row 1, column 8 is o. From there, can move down to (2,8). \n\nHow to get to (1,8)? \n\nFrom row 0, column 8. \n\nRow 0 is all o's. So from (0,8), move down to (1,8). \n\nSo here's a possible path:\n\nStart at (0,0) → right to (0,8), then down to (1,8), then down to (2,8), then down to (3,8). \n\nLet me try this. \n\nStarting again:\n\n(0,0) → right to (0,1), (0,2)... up to (0,8). \n\nAt (0,8), move down to (1,8). \n\nNow at (1,8). \n\nFrom here, down to (2,8). \n\nAt (2,8), down to (3,8). \n\nNow at (3,8), which is o. \n\nFrom here, can move down to (4,8). \n\nRow 4, column 8: row 4 is o*ooooo*ooooo. Column 8 is *? Let me check. \n\nRow 4: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: o, 4: o, 5: o, 6: o, 7: *, 8: o? Wait, no. Let me re-parse row 4. \n\nRow 4: \"o*ooooo*ooooo\". Let's break it down:\n\n- o (0)\n- * (1)\n- o (2)\n- o (3)\n- o (4)\n- o (5)\n- o (6)\n- * (7)\n- o (8)\n- o (9)\n- o (10)\n- o (11)\n- o (12)\n\nYes! So column 8 is o. \n\nSo from (3,8), down to (4,8). \n\nNow at (4,8). \n\nFrom here, possible moves: \n\n- Down to (5,8). Check row 5, column 8. Row 5 is \"o*********o*o\". Columns 1-10 are *, so column 8 is *. Can't move down. \n\nSo need to move elsewhere. \n\nPossible directions: left, right, up. \n\nFrom (4,8), move right to (4,9). Row 4, column 9 is o. \n\nYes. \n\nMove to (4,9). \n\nFrom here, can move right to (4,10), (4,11), (4,12). \n\nBut let's see: row 4's columns 9-12 are o's. \n\nSo moving to (4,12). \n\nAt (4,12), can move down to (5,12). \n\nRow 5, column 12 is o. \n\nYes. \n\nSo down to (5,12). \n\nNow at (5,12). \n\nFrom here, possible moves: \n\n- Down to (6,12). Row 6, column 12: row 6 is \"ooo*ooooo*o*o\". Let me check column 12. \n\nRow 6: \"ooo*ooooo*o*o\". Let's parse columns:\n\nAssuming it's ooo*ooooo*o*o. \n\nColumns 0-2: o, column 3: *, columns 4-8: o, column 9: *, column 10: o, 11: *, 12: o. \n\nYes. So column 12 is o. \n\nSo down to (6,12). \n\nAt (6,12), down to (7,12). Row 7, column 12: row 7 is \"o*o*o*****o*o\". Let me check column 12. \n\nRow 7: o*o*o*****o*o. Columns 12 is o? Let me parse:\n\nAssuming the line is o * o * o * * * * * o * o. \n\nWait, let me break it down:\n\nRow 7: columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3: *, 4: o, then five *s (columns 5-9), then column 10: o, 11: *, 12: o. \n\nYes. So column 12 is o. \n\nSo down to (7,12). \n\nFrom here, down to (8,12). Row 8: \"o*ooooooo*o*o\". Column 12: o? \n\nRow 8: o*ooooooo*o*o. Columns 12: o? Let me parse:\n\nColumns 0: o, 1: *, then seven o's (columns 2-8?), then * at column 9, o at 10, * at 11, o at 12. Yes. \n\nSo down to (8,12). \n\nDown to (9,12). Row 9: \"o***o*****o*o\". Column 12: o? Let me check. \n\nRow 9: o***o*****o*o. Columns 0: o, 1-3: *, column 4: o, then five *s (columns 5-9), column 10: o, 11: *, 12: o. Yes. \n\nSo down to (9,12). \n\nDown to (10,12). Row 10: \"o*ooooooo*o*o\". Column 12 is o. \n\nDown to (10,12). \n\nDown to (11,12). Row 11: \"o*o***o***o*o\". Column 12 is o? Let me check. \n\nRow 11: o*o***o***o*o. Columns 0: o, 1: *, 2: o, 3-5: ***, column 6: o, 7-9: ***, column 10: o, 11: *, 12: o. Yes. \n\nSo down to (11,12). \n\nDown to (12,12). Which is X! \n\nYes! So this path works. \n\nLet me retrace the steps to confirm:\n\nStart at (0,0) → move right 8 times to (0,8) → down to (1,8) → down to (2,8) → down to (3,8) → down to (4,8) → right to (4,9), (4,10), (4,11), (4,12) → down to (5,12) → down to (6,12) → down to (7,12) → down to (8,12) → down to (9,12) → down to (10,12) → down to (11,12) → down to (12,12). \n\nNow, converting these movements into the required list of directions. \n\nLet's break it down step by step. \n\nFrom (0,0) to (0,8): moving right 8 times. \n\nEach step is 'right'. \n\nThen from (0,8) to (1,8): down. \n\nThen from (1,8) to (2,8): down. \n\nThen from (2,8) to (3,8): down. \n\nFrom (3,8) to (4,8): down. \n\nFrom (4,8) to (4,9): right. \n\nFrom (4,9) to (4,10): right. \n\nFrom (4,10) to (4,11): right. \n\nFrom (4,11) to (4,12): right. \n\nThen from (4,12) to (5,12): down. \n\nThen down steps from 5 to 12: each down step from row 5 to 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. That's 7 down steps. \n\nSo total moves:\n\nRight 8 times → 8 'right's.\n\nThen 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down' (4 times).\n\nThen 'right' 4 times.\n\nThen 'down' 7 times.\n\nSo the list would be:\n\n['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']\n\nLet me count the number of steps:\n\nRight 8: 8 entries.\n\nThen 4 downs.\n\nThen 4 rights.\n\nThen 7 downs. Total of 8+4+4+7 = 23 steps. \n\nBut let me verify each step to ensure correctness. \n\nLet me map each movement:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nMove right 8 times: ends at (0,8).\n\nThen down 4 times: (0,8) → (1,8) → (2,8) → (3,8) → (4,8). So 4 down steps.\n\nThen right 4 times: from (4,8) to (4,12). Since from 8 to 12 is 4 steps (8→9, 9→10, 10→11, 11→12). So 4 rights.\n\nThen down from (4,12) to (12,12): rows 4 to 12 is 8 steps (rows 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12). Wait, from row 4 to row 12 is 8 down steps? Let me count:\n\nFrom row 4 to 5: 1\n\n5→6: 2\n\n6→7:3\n\n7→8:4\n\n8→9:5\n\n9→10:6\n\n10→11:7\n\n11→12:8. \n\nAh, so 8 down steps, not 7. Earlier calculation said 7, but it's actually 8. \n\nSo the down steps after the rights are 8 steps. \n\nSo the correct breakdown is:\n\nRight 8, down 4, right 4, down 8. \n\nTotal steps: 8+4+4+8=24 steps. \n\nLet me recount the down steps after the right 4. \n\nStarting at (4,12), moving down to row 5, then 6,7,8,9,10,11,12: that's 8 steps (from row 4 to 12 inclusive is 9 rows, so 8 steps down). \n\nSo the list should have:\n\n['right'] *8 + ['down']*4 + ['right']*4 + ['down']*8.\n\nSo the answer list would be:\n\n['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']\n\nYes. \n\nNow, let's check if this path is valid. \n\nLet me verify each segment.\n\nFrom (0,0) to (0,8): all o's, correct. \n\nThen down to (1,8): row 1, column 8 is o. \n\nThen down to (2,8): row 2, column 8 is o. \n\nDown to (3,8): row 3, column 8 is o. \n\nDown to (4,8): row 4, column 8 is o. \n\nThen right to (4,9): o, (4,10): o, (4,11): o, (4,12): o. \n\nThen down steps:\n\n(4,12) → (5,12): row 5, column 12 is o. \n\n(5,12) → (6,12): row 6, column 12 is o. \n\n(6,12) → (7,12): row 7, column 12 is o. \n\n(7,12) → (8,12): row 8, column 12 is o. \n\n(8,12) → (9,12): row 9, column 12 is o. \n\n(9,12) → (10,12): row 10, column 12 is o. \n\n(10,12) → (11,12): row 11, column 12 is o. \n\n(11,12) → (12,12): which is X. \n\nYes! All these positions are valid. \n\nSo the path is correct. \n\nNow, converting this into the required list of moves. \n\nThe moves are all 'right's and 'down's. \n\nSo the final answer is a list of 8 'right's, 4 'down's, 4 'right's, and 8 'down's. \n\nSo the Answer: ['right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down'] \n\nI think this should be correct. Let me check once more for any possible errors. \n\nFor example, when moving down from row 4 to row 5: yes, row 5, column 12 is o. \n\nYes. And all the steps in between are passable. \n\nYes. This seems to be a valid path.\n ;Answer: ['right','right','right','right','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','right','right','right','right','down','down','down','down','down','down','down','down']"
