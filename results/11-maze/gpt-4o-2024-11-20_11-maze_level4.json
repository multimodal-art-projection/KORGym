Here's the solution:\n\n### Maze Analysis\n1. **Symbols**:\n   - `I` is the starting point (Top-left corner at `(0,0)` in 0-indexed coordinates).\n   - `X` is the destination point (Bottom-right corner at `(10,10)`).\n   - `o` represents passable cells.\n   - `*` represents walls (impassable).\n\n2. **Allowed Moves**:\n   - **up**: decrease row index.\n   - **down**: increase row index.\n   - **left**: decrease column index.\n   - **right**: increase column index.\n\n### Approach\nWe can use a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** approach to find the shortest path from `I` to `X`. BFS is ideal for unweighted grids since it explores all possible paths level by level, guaranteeing the shortest path.\n\n### Solution Implementation\nThe output will be the path represented as a list of directions (`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`).\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve_maze(maze):\n    # Convert the string maze into a 2D list\n    maze = [list(row) for row in maze.splitlines()]\n    rows, cols = len(maze), len(maze[0])\n    \n    # Find the starting point (I) and destination point (X)\n    start, end = None, None\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if maze[r][c] == 'I':\n                start = (r, c)\n            elif maze[r][c] == 'X':\n                end = (r, c)\n    \n    # Directions for moving in the maze\n    directions = {\n        'up': (-1, 0),\n        'down': (1, 0),\n        'left': (0, -1),\n        'right': (0, 1)\n    }\n    \n    # BFS setup\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])  # (current_position, path_taken)\n    visited = set()  # To avoid revisiting nodes\n    \n    while queue:\n        (current_row, current_col), path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # If we reach the goal, return the path\n        if (current_row, current_col) == end:\n            return path\n        \n        # Mark the current cell as visited\n        visited.add((current_row, current_col))\n        \n        # Explore all possible moves\n        for move, (dr, dc) in directions.items():\n            next_row, next_col = current_row + dr, current_col + dc\n            \n            # Check if the move is within bounds and the cell is passable\n            if (0 <= next_row < rows and\n                0 <= next_col < cols and\n                maze[next_row][next_col] != '*' and\n                (next_row, next_col) not in visited):\n                queue.append(((next_row, next_col), path + [move]))\n\n# Define the maze as a multi-line string\nmaze = \"\"\"I*o*o*ooooo\no*o*o*o****\nooooo*ooooo\no***o*o*o*o\nooo*ooo*o*o\no***o*****o\no*ooooooo*o\no***o*o*o*o\no*ooo*o*o*o\no***o***o*o\nooo*ooo*o*X\"\"\"\n\n# Solve the maze and print the answer\nanswer = solve_maze(maze)\nprint(f\"Answer: {answer}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n1. The **maze input** is parsed into a 2D list for easier manipulation and navigation.\n2. We locate the start (`I`) and destination (`X`) positions.\n3.
