We will use a greedy algorithm approach to color the nodes while ensuring no two adjacent nodes have the same color.\n\nGiven the edges, let's start coloring the nodes:\n\n1. Start with node 0 and assign it color 0.\n2. Move to its neighbors and assign them different colors.\n3. Continue this process for all nodes, making sure that no two connected nodes share the same color.\n\nLet's go through the process step-by-step:\n\n- Assign node 0 color 0.\n- Node 14 is connected to node 0, so assign node 14 color 1.\n- Node 22 is connected to node 0, so assign node 22 color 1.\n- Node 1 is connected to node 2, so if node 2 gets color 0, node 1 gets color 1.\n- Node 2 is also connected to node 12, which is connected to several other nodes, so we'll keep track of these connections as we move forward.\n\nFollowing this approach, we can generate the following coloring scheme:\n\n```json\nAnswer: [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 0], [3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0], [6, 1], [7, 1], [8, 1], [9, 0], [10, 0], [11, 0], [12, 1], [13, 0], [14, 1], [15, 2], [16, 2], [17, 1], [18, 2], [19, 2], [20, 0], [21, 1], [22, 1], [23, 0]]\n```\n\nThis coloring scheme ensures that no two adjacent nodes share the same color, and only three colors (0, 1, 2) are used."],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, I will use a simple greedy approach to assign colors.\n\nHere's one possible solution:\n\n```json\nAnswer: [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 1], [6, 2], [7, 2], [8, 0], [9, 1], [10, 0], [11, 1], [12, 2], [13, 0], [14, 0], [15, 1], [16, 2], [17, 2], [18, 1], [19, 0], [20, 1], [21, 0], [22, 2], [23, 1], [24, 1], [25, 2], [26, 1], [27, 0], [28, 0], [29, 1], [30, 1]]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Each node is assigned a color such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.\n- For example, node `0` is connected to nodes `2`, `5`, and `30`. Since `2` has color `1`, `5` has color `1`, and `30` has color `1`, node `0` is assigned color `0`.\n- Similarly, each node is checked against its neighbors to ensure it gets a unique color among them.\n\nThis is just one of many possible solutions, as graph coloring problems often have multiple valid colorings."],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.
