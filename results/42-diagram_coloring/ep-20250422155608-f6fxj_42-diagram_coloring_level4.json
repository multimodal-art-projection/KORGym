The goal is to color 34 nodes (0-33) with exactly 3 colors (0,1,2) such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. First, I need to understand the graph structure by looking at the edges provided. Let's list out all the edges to see which nodes are connected.\n\nEdges list:\n13-30, 16-32, 4-6, 4-12, 3-16, 20-32, 21-31, 8-9, 0-5, 8-18, 2-5, 5-28, 2-11, 28-33, 19-30, 17-33, 2-26, 25-31, 15-20, 18-19, 4-5, 21-30, 14-15, 9-19, 9-28, 0-25, 8-32, 13-22, 6-16, 25-33, 7-21, 16-30, 6-22, 6-31, 20-24, 20-27, 11-12, 13-18, 15-18.\n\nLet me start by identifying nodes with high degrees. Let's count connections for each node:\n\n- Node 5: connected to 0, 2, 4, 28 (4 edges)\n- Node 8: connected to 9, 18, 32 (3 edges)\n- Node 9: connected to 8, 19, 28 (3 edges)\n- Node 18: connected to 8, 19, 13, 15 (4 edges)\n- Node 19: connected to 18, 9, 30 (3 edges)\n- Node 30: connected to 13, 19, 21, 16 (4 edges)\n- Node 16: connected to 32, 3, 6, 30 (4 edges)\n- Node 32: connected to 16, 20, 8 (3 edges)\n- Node 20: connected to 32, 15, 24, 27 (4 edges)\n- Node 15: connected to 20, 14, 18 (3 edges)\n- Node 21: connected to 31, 30, 7 (3 edges)\n- Node 31: connected to 21, 25, 6 (3 edges)\n- Node 25: connected to 31, 0, 33 (3 edges)\n- Node 33: connected to 28, 17, 25 (3 edges)\n- Node 28: connected to 5, 9, 33 (3 edges)\n- Node 4: connected to 6, 12, 5 (3 edges)\n- Node 6: connected to 4, 16, 22, 31 (4 edges)\n- Node 22: connected to 13, 6 (2 edges)\n- Node 13: connected to 30, 22, 18 (3 edges)\n- Node 2: connected to 5, 11, 26 (3 edges)\n- Node 11: connected to 2, 12 (2 edges)\n- Node 12: connected to 4, 11 (2 edges)\n- Node 0: connected to 5, 25 (2 edges)\n- Node 17: connected to 33 (1 edge)\n- Node 7: connected to 21 (1 edge)\n- Node 3: connected to 16 (1 edge)\n- Node 14: connected to 15 (1 edge)\n- Node 24: connected to 20 (1 edge)\n- Node 27: connected to 20 (1 edge)\n- Node 26: connected to 2 (1 edge)\n- Nodes 1, maybe? Let's check: I don't see node 1 in any edge. Oh, node 1 isn't connected to anyone. So node 1 is an isolated node. That's important; it can be colored with any color.\n\nSo node 1 is isolated. Let's note that. Now, the key is to color the connected components. Let's see if the graph is connected. Let's check if all nodes are reachable from some node. Let's start with node 5: connected to 0, 2, 4, 28. 0 is connected to 25, which is connected to 31, 21, 33, 17. 25 is connected to 31, which is connected to 21, 6. 6 is connected to 4, 16, 22, 31. 4 is connected to 12, which is connected to 11, which is connected to 2. 2 is connected to 26. 6 is connected to 16, which is connected to 3, 32, 30. 32 is connected to 20, 8. 20 is connected to 15, 24, 27. 15 is connected to 14, 18. 18 is connected to 8, 19, 13. 8 is connected to 9, which is connected to 19, 28. 19 is connected to 30. 30 is connected to 13, 21. 13 is connected to 22. 21 is connected to 7. 28 is connected to 33. So that's a big connected component. The only node not in this is node 1, which is isolated.\n\nSo the graph has two components: one big component (all nodes except 1) and one isolated node (1).\n\nNow, let's start coloring. Since we need 3 colors, we can use a greedy approach, maybe BFS, assigning colors not used by neighbors.\n\nLet's list the nodes in some order, maybe starting with the most connected ones.\n\nLet's start with node 1: isolated, color 0.\n\nNode 5: let's pick color 0. Its neighbors are 0,2,4,28. So 0,2,4,28 can't be 0.\n\nNode 0 is neighbor of 5 (color 0), so node 0 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Node 0's neighbors: 5 (0) and 25. So 25 can't be 1.\n\nNode 2 is neighbor of 5 (0), so node 2 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Node 2's neighbors: 5 (0), 11, 26. So 11 and 26 can't be 1.\n\nNode 4 is neighbor of 5 (0), so node 4 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Node 4's neighbors: 6, 12, 5 (0). So 6, 12 can't be 1.\n\nNode 28 is neighbor of 5 (0), so node 28 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Node 28's neighbors: 5 (0), 9, 33. So 9 and 33 can't be 1.\n\nNow, node 0 is color 1. Its neighbor 25: can't be 1. Let's color 25 with 0. 25's neighbors: 0 (1), 31, 33. So 31 and 33 can't be 0.\n\nNode 2 is color 1. Its neighbor 11: can't be 1. Let's color 11 with 0. 11's neighbor 12: 12 is neighbor of 4 (1) and 11 (0). So 12 can't be 1 or 0, so 12 must be 2.\n\nNode 4 is color 1. Its neighbor 6: can't be 1. 6's neighbors: 4 (1), 16, 22, 31. Let's see 6's possible colors: 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 28 is color 1. Its neighbor 9: can't be 1. 9's neighbors: 8, 19, 28 (1). Let's color 9 with 0. 9's neighbor 19: can't be 0. 9's neighbor 8: can't be 0.\n\nNode 25 is color 0. Its neighbor 31: can't be 0. 31's neighbors: 21, 25 (0), 6 (0). So 31 can't be 0, and 6 is 0, so 31 can't be 0. So 31 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. 31's neighbor 21: can't be 1. 31's neighbor 6 (0) is okay.\n\nNode 25 is color 0. Its neighbor 33: can't be 0. 33's neighbors: 28 (1), 17, 25 (0). So 33 can't be 0 or 1, so 33 must be 2. 33's neighbor 17: can't be 2. 17 is only connected to 33 (2), so 17 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 6 is color 0. Its neighbor 16: can't be 0. 16's neighbors: 32, 3, 6 (0), 30. So 16 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. 16's neighbor 32: can't be 1. 16's neighbor 3: can't be 1. 16's neighbor 30: can't be 1.\n\nNode 6 is color 0. Its neighbor 22: can't be 0. 22's neighbors: 13, 6 (0). So 22 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. 22's neighbor 13: can't be 1.\n\nNode 12 is color 2. Its neighbor 11 is 0, which is okay. 12's neighbor 4 is 1, okay.\n\nNode 9 is color 0. Its neighbor 8: can't be 0. 8's neighbors: 9 (0), 18, 32. So 8 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. 8's neighbor 18: can't be 1. 8's neighbor 32: can't be 1.\n\nNode 9 is color 0. Its neighbor 19: can't be 0. 19's neighbors: 18, 9 (0), 30. So 19 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. 19's neighbor 18: can't be 1. 19's neighbor 30: can't be 1.\n\nNode 31 is color 1. Its neighbor 21: can't be 1. 21's neighbors: 31 (1), 30, 7. So 21 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. 21's neighbor 30: can't be 0. 21's neighbor 7: can't be 0. 7 is only connected to 21 (0), so 7 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 33 is color 2. Its neighbor 17 is 0, okay.\n\nNode 16 is color 1. Its neighbor 3: can't be 1. 3 is only connected to 16 (1), so 3 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 16 is color 1. Its neighbor 32: can't be 1. 32's neighbors: 16 (1), 20, 8 (1). So 32 can't be 1. So 32 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. 32's neighbor 20: can't be 0.\n\nNode 22 is color 1. Its neighbor 13: can't be 1. 13's neighbors: 30, 22 (1), 18. So 13 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. 13's neighbor 30: can't be 0. 13's neighbor 18: can't be 0.\n\nNode 8 is color 1. Its neighbor 18: can't be 1. 18's neighbors: 8 (1), 19 (1), 13 (0), 15. So 18 can't be 1 or 0 (since 13 is 0), so 18 must be 2. 18's neighbor 15: can't be 2. 18's neighbor 19 (1) is okay.\n\nNode 19 is color 1. Its neighbor 18 (2) is okay. 19's neighbor 30: can't be 1. 30's neighbors: 13 (0), 19 (1), 21 (0), 16 (1). So 30 can't be 0, 1. So 30 must be 2. 30's neighbor 13 (0) is okay, 19 (1) is okay, 21 (0) is okay, 16 (1) is okay.\n\nNode 21 is color 0. Its neighbor 30 (2) is okay. 21's neighbor 7 (1) is okay.\n\nNode 32 is color 0. Its neighbor 20: can't be 0. 20's neighbors: 32 (0), 15, 24, 27. Let's see 20's possible colors: 1 or 2. 15 is connected to 20, 14, 18 (2). 15's neighbor 18 is 2, so 15 can't be 2. 15 is connected to 20 (needs color not 20's color). Let's pick 20's color as 1. Then 15 can't be 1. 15's neighbors: 20 (1), 14, 18 (2). So 15 can be 0. Let's check 15: 0. Then 20 (1) is okay. 15's neighbor 14: can't be 0. 14 is only connected to 15 (0), so 14 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 20 is color 1. Its neighbor 24: can't be 1. 24 is only connected to 20 (1), so 24 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 20 is color 1. Its neighbor 27: can't be 1. 27 is only connected to 20 (1), so 27 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 18 is color 2. Its neighbor 15 (0) is okay. 18's neighbor 13 (0) is okay, 8 (1) is okay, 19 (1) is okay.\n\nNode 30 is color 2. Its neighbor 13 (0) is okay, 19 (1) is okay, 21 (0) is okay, 16 (1) is okay.\n\nNode 13 is color 0. Its neighbor 22 (1) is okay.\n\nNode 32 is color 0. Its neighbor 8 (1) is okay.\n\nNode 16 is color 1. Its neighbor 3 (0) is okay.\n\nNode 6 is color 0. Its neighbor 31 (1) is okay.\n\nNode 25 is color 0. Its neighbor 0 (1) is okay.\n\nNode 28 is color 1. Its neighbor 33 (2) is okay.\n\nNode 4 is color 1. Its neighbor 12 (2) is okay.\n\nNode 2 is color 1. Its neighbor 11 (0) is okay. 2's neighbor 26: 2 is color 1, so 26 can't be 1. 26 is only connected to 2 (1), so 26 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNow, let's check all nodes:\n\n- Node 0: 1 (neighbors 5 (0), 25 (0) → okay)\n- Node 1: 0 (isolated → okay)\n- Node 2: 1 (neighbors 5 (0), 11 (0), 26 (0) → okay)\n- Node 3: 0 (neighbor 16 (1) → okay)\n- Node 4: 1 (neighbors 6 (0), 12 (2), 5 (0) → okay)\n- Node 5: 0 (neighbors 0 (1), 2 (1), 4 (1), 28 (1) → okay)\n- Node 6: 0 (neighbors 4 (1), 16 (1), 22 (1), 31 (1) → okay)\n- Node 7: 1 (neighbor 21 (0) → okay)\n- Node 8: 1 (neighbors 9 (0), 18 (2), 32 (0) → okay)\n- Node 9: 0 (neighbors 8 (1), 19 (1), 28 (1) → okay)\n- Node 10: Wait, did I miss node 10? Oh, the nodes are 0-33, so node 10 isn't in any edge. So node 10 is isolated. Oh, right! I didn't list all nodes. Let's check the nodes: 0-33. So nodes 1, 10, and maybe others? Let's see which nodes are not in the edges:\n\nLooking at edges, the nodes involved are: 13,30,16,32,4,6,12,3,20,21,31,8,9,0,5,18,2,11,28,33,19,17,26,25,15,14,7,24,27. So missing nodes: 1,10. So node 1 and 10 are isolated. So node 10 can be colored with any color. Let's color node 10 with 0 (since 1 is 0, but it's isolated, so it's okay).\n\nContinuing:\n\n- Node 10: 0 (isolated → okay)\n- Node 11: 0 (neighbors 2 (1), 12 (2) → okay)\n- Node 12: 2 (neighbors 4 (1), 11 (0) → okay)\n- Node 13: 0 (neighbors 30 (2), 22 (1), 18 (2) → okay)\n- Node 14: 1 (neighbor 15 (0) → okay)\n- Node 15: 0 (neighbors 20 (1), 14 (1), 18 (2) → okay)\n- Node 16: 1 (neighbors 32 (0), 3 (0), 6 (0), 30 (2) → okay)\n- Node 17: 0 (neighbor 33 (2) → okay)\n- Node 18: 2 (neighbors 8 (1), 19 (1), 13 (0), 15 (0) → okay)\n- Node 19: 1 (neighbors 18 (2), 9 (0), 30 (2) → okay)\n- Node 20: 1 (neighbors 32 (0), 15 (0), 24 (0), 27 (0) → okay)\n- Node 21: 0 (neighbors 31 (1), 30 (2), 7 (1) → okay)\n- Node 22: 1 (neighbors 13 (0), 6 (0) → okay)\n- Node 23: Wait, node 23 is also in 0-33. Did I miss node 23? The edges don't include node 23. So node 23 is isolated. Oh right! So nodes 1,10,23 are isolated. Let's confirm edges again. All edges listed don't mention 1,10,23. So those three are isolated. So node 23 can be colored with any color. Let's color node 23 with 0.\n\nContinuing:\n\n- Node 24: 0 (neighbor 20 (1) → okay)\n- Node 25: 0 (neighbors 0 (1), 31 (1), 33 (2) → okay)\n- Node 26: 0 (neighbor 2 (1) → okay)\n- Node 27: 0 (neighbor 20 (1) → okay)\n- Node 28: 1 (neighbors 5 (0), 9 (0), 33 (2) → okay)\n- Node 29: Oh, node 29 is also in 0-33. Edges don't mention 29. So node 29 is isolated. So node 29 is isolated. Color 0.\n- Node 30: 2 (neighbors 13 (0), 19 (1), 21 (0), 16 (1) → okay)\n- Node 31: 1 (neighbors 21 (0), 25 (0), 6 (0) → okay)\n- Node 32: 0 (neighbors 16 (1), 20 (1), 8 (1) → okay)\n- Node 33: 2 (neighbors 28 (1), 17 (0), 25 (0) → okay)\n\nNow, let's check all isolated nodes: 1,10,23,29. They can be colored with any color. Let's assign them 0. But wait, we need to use exactly 3 colors. So at least one node of each color (0,1,2) must be present. Let's check if all colors are used.\n\nColor 0: nodes 1,5,10,11,17,23,24,25,26,27,29,3,32 (wait, 3 is 0, 32 is 0, 5 is 0, 11 is 0, 17 is 0, 24 is 0, 25 is 0, 26 is 0, 27 is 0, 1 is 0, 10 is 0, 23 is 0, 29 is 0). That's a lot of 0s.\n\nColor 1: nodes 0,2,4,7,8,14,19,20,22,28,31 (0 is 1, 2 is 1, 4 is 1, 7 is 1, 8 is 1, 14 is 1, 19 is 1, 20 is 1, 22 is 1, 28 is 1, 31 is 1).\n\nColor 2: nodes 12,18,30,33 (12 is 2, 18 is 2, 30 is 2, 33 is 2).\n\nSo all three colors are present. Good.\n\nNow, let's check if any adjacent nodes have the same color. Let's check a few:\n\n- 5 (0) and 0 (1): okay.\n- 5 (0) and 2 (1): okay.\n- 5 (0) and 4 (1): okay.\n- 5 (0) and 28 (1): okay.\n- 0 (1) and 25 (0): okay.\n- 2 (1) and 11 (0): okay.\n- 2 (1) and 26 (0): okay.\n- 4 (1) and 6 (0): okay.\n- 4 (1) and 12 (2): okay.\n- 28 (1) and 9 (0): okay.\n- 28 (1) and 33 (2): okay.\n- 25 (0) and 31 (1): okay.\n- 25 (0) and 33 (2): okay.\n- 6 (0) and 16 (1): okay.\n- 6 (0) and 22 (1): okay.\n- 6 (0) and 31 (1): okay.\n- 16 (1) and 32 (0): okay.\n- 16 (1) and 3 (0): okay.\n- 16 (1) and 30 (2): okay.\n- 32 (0) and 20 (1): okay.\n- 32 (0) and 8 (1): okay.\n- 20 (1) and 15 (0): okay.\n- 20 (1) and 24 (0): okay.\n- 20 (1) and 27 (0): okay.\n- 15 (0) and 14 (1): okay.\n- 15 (0) and 18 (2): okay.\n- 18 (2) and 8 (1): okay.\n- 18 (2) and 19 (1): okay.\n- 18 (2) and 13 (0): okay.\n- 19 (1) and 9 (0): okay.\n- 19 (1) and 30 (2): okay.\n- 30 (2) and 13 (0): okay.\n- 30 (2) and 21 (0): okay.\n- 21 (0) and 31 (1): okay.\n- 21 (0) and 7 (1): okay.\n- 31 (1) and 6 (0): okay.\n- 33 (2) and 17 (0): okay.\n- 12 (2) and 11 (0): okay.\n- 13 (0) and 22 (1): okay.\n- 8 (1) and 9 (0): okay.\n- 22 (1) and 6 (0): okay.\n- 7 (1) and 21 (0): okay.\n- 3 (0) and 16 (1): okay.\n- 14 (1) and 15 (0): okay.\n- 24 (0) and 20 (1): okay.\n- 27 (0) and 20 (1): okay.\n- 26 (0) and 2 (1): okay.\n- 17 (0) and 33 (2): okay.\n\nAll adjacent nodes have different colors.

So neighbors are 17,10,13,9,12.\n\nNode 1: I need to check if node 1 has any edges. Looking at the edge list: 6-12, 7-17, 3-7, 0-17, 2-8, 13-17, 7-16, 3-9, 14-15, 3-15, 8-14, 0-10, 0-13, 13-16, 3-5, 0-9, 0-12, 10-16, 7-11, 6-9, 7-14. Oh, node 1 isn't mentioned in any edges.

So 13 can be 2. Then 16 (neighbor of 13) can't be 2.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 0,3,6. 0 is 0. Let's color node 9 with color 1. Then 3 and 6 can't be 1.\n\nNode 12 is connected to 0,6. 0 is 0. Let's color node 12 with color 1. Then 6 can't be 1.\n\nNow, node 16 is connected to 7,10,13. 10 is 1, 13 is 2. So 16 can't be 1 or 2, so must be 0.

So 3 must be 0.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 12 (1), 9 (1). So 6 can't be 1.

Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 15 is connected to 3 (0), 14. 3 is 0, so 15 can be 1 or 2. Let's see node 14: connected to 15, 8, 7 (2). 7 is 2, so 14 can't be 2. Let's color 14 with 0. Then 15 (connected to 14 (0)) can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 8 is connected to 2, 14 (0). So 8 can't be 0. Let's color 8 with 1. Then 2 (connected to 8 (1)) can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 11 is connected to 7 (2). So 11 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNow, check node 2: connected to 8 (1). So 2 can be 0 (as above) or 2.

So node 10 is isolated.\n11: 19, 3\n12: 16, 13, 22, 20\n13: 12\n14: 4\n15: 6, 8, 17, 20\n16: 12\n17: 7, 15, 4\n18: 23, 24, 2\n19: 23, 0, 11\n20: 15, 4, 12\n21: 8, 24\n22: 12, 6\n23: 18, 0, 19\n24: 21, 18, 0\n\nOkay, node 10 has no edges, so it can be colored with any color, say 0.\n\nNow, let's start with node 0. Its neighbors are 23, 19, 24. Let's assign color 0 to node 0. Then 23, 19, 24 can't be 0.\n\nNode 1: neighbors 9,4. Let's pick color 1 for node 1. Then 9 and 4 can't be 1.\n\nNode 2: neighbors 5,18. Let's color 2 with 0. Then 5 and 18 can't be 0.\n\nNode 3: neighbor 11. Let's color 3 with 0. Then 11 can't be 0.\n\nNode 4: neighbors 14,17,20,7,1. Node 1 is color 1, so 4 can't be 1. Let's check 4's neighbors. Let's assign 4 to 0. Then 14,17,20,7 can't be 0.\n\nNode 5: neighbor 2 (color 0). So 5 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 6: neighbors 15,22. Let's color 6 with 0. Then 15 and 22 can't be 0.\n\nNode 7: neighbors 17,4 (color 0). So 7 can't be 0. Let's color 7 with 1. Then 17 can't be 1.\n\nNode 8: neighbors 15,21. Let's color 8 with 0. Then 15 and 21 can't be 0.\n\nNode 9: neighbor 1 (color 1). So 9 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 10: isolated, color 0.\n\nNode 11: neighbors 19,3 (color 0). So 11 can't be 0. Let's color 11 with 1. Then 19 can't be 1.\n\nNode 12: neighbors 16,13,22,20. Let's color 12 with 0. Then 16,13,22,20 can't be 0.\n\nNode 13: neighbor 12 (color 0). So 13 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 14: neighbor 4 (color 0). So 14 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 15: neighbors 6 (color 0), 8 (color 0), 17, 20. So 15 can't be 0. Let's check 17 and 20. 17 is neighbor of 7 (color 1), 15 (so 17 can't be 1), 4 (color 0) so 17 can't be 0. So 17 must be 2. Then 15's neighbor 17 is 2, so 15 can be 1 (since 15 can't be 0). Let's color 15 with 1. Then 20, which is neighbor of 15 (color 1), 4 (color 0), 12 (color 0). So 20 can't be 0 or 1. So 20 must be 2.\n\nNode 16: neighbor 12 (color 0). So 16 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 17: as above, neighbor 7 (1), 15 (1), 4 (0). So 17 can't be 0 or 1, so 2. That's good.\n\nNode 18: neighbors 23, 24, 2 (color 0). Let's check 23's color. 23 is neighbor of 0 (color 0), 18, 19. 19 is neighbor of 0 (0), 23, 11 (1). So 19 can't be 0 or 1, so 19 must be 2. Then 23 is neighbor of 0 (0), 18, 19 (2). So 23 can't be 0 or 2, so 23 must be 1. Then 18 is neighbor of 23 (1), 24, 2 (0). So 18 can't be 0 or 1, so 18 must be 2. Then 24 is neighbor of 0 (0), 21, 18 (2). Let's see 21: neighbor 8 (0), 24. 21 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 21 with 1. Then 24 is neighbor of 0 (0), 21 (1), 18 (2). So 24 can be 0? Wait, 0 is color 0, so 24 can't be 0. 21 is 1, 18 is 2. So 24 can be 0? No, 0 is connected to 24, so 24 can't be 0. 21 is 1, so 24 can't be 1. 18 is 2, so 24 can't be 2? That's a problem. Wait, let's backtrack.\n\nLet me re-examine 24's connections. 24 is connected to 21, 18, 0. 0 is color 0, 18's color: let's see 18 is connected to 23 (1), 24, 2 (0). So 18 can't be 0 or 1, so 18 is 2. Then 24 is connected to 18 (2), 0 (0), 21. 21 is connected to 8 (0) and 24. So 21 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 21 to 2. Then 24's neighbors are 21 (2), 18 (2), 0 (0). So 24 can't be 0 or 2. So 24 must be 1. That works. So 24 is 1.\n\nNow, 23: connected to 0 (0), 18 (2), 19. 19 is connected to 0 (0), 23, 11 (1). So 19 can't be 0 or 1, so 19 is 2. Then 23 is connected to 0 (0), 18 (2), 19 (2). So 23 can't be 0 or 2, so 23 must be 1. That works.\n\nNode 20: connected to 15 (1), 4 (0), 12 (0). So 20 can't be 0 or 1, so 20 is 2. That's good.\n\nNode 21: connected to 8 (0), 24 (1). So 21 can be 2. That works.\n\nNode 22: connected to 12 (0), 6 (0). So 22 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nLet's check all nodes:\n\n0: 0 (neighbors 23:1, 19:2, 24:1 → okay)\n1: 1 (neighbors 9,4)\n9: let's check 9. 9 is connected to 1 (1). So 9 can be 0 or 2. Let's set 9 to 0. So 1's neighbors 9 (0) and 4. 4 is 0, which is same as 1's color 1, okay.\n\n4: 0 (neighbors 14,17,20,7,1). 1 is 1, 7 is 1, 17 is 2, 20 is 2, 14 is 1. All different from 0, okay.\n\n7: 1 (neighbors 17:2, 4:0 → okay)\n17: 2 (neighbors 7:1, 15:1, 4:0 → okay)\n15: 1 (neighbors 6:0, 8:0, 17:2, 20:2 → okay)\n20: 2 (neighbors 15:1, 4:0, 12:0 → okay)\n12: 0 (neighbors 16,13,22,20:2 → 16:1, 13:1, 22:1 → all different from 0, okay)\n16: 1 (neighbor 12:0 → okay)\n13: 1 (neighbor 12:0 → okay)\n22: 1 (neighbors 12:0, 6:0 → okay)\n6: 0 (neighbors 15:1, 22:1 → okay)\n8: 0 (neighbors 15:1, 21:2 → okay)\n21: 2 (neighbors 8:0, 24:1 → okay)\n24: 1 (neighbors 21:2, 18:2, 0:0 → okay)\n18: 2 (neighbors 23:1, 24:1, 2:0 → okay)\n2: 0 (neighbors 5:1, 18:2 → okay)\n5: 1 (neighbor 2:0 → okay)\n3: 0 (neighbor 11:1 → okay)\n11: 1 (neighbors 19:2, 3:0 → okay)\n19: 2 (neighbors 23:1, 0:0, 11:1 → okay)\n23: 1 (neighbors 18:2, 0:0, 19:2 → okay)\n10: 0 (no neighbors → okay)\n14: 1 (neighbor 4:0 → okay)\n\nLet's verify all nodes:\n\n0: color 0. Neighbors 23(1),19(2),24(1) → all different. Good.\n1: color 1. Neighbors 9(0),4(0) → different. Good.\n2: color 0. Neighbors 5(1),18(2) → different. Good.\n3: color 0. Neighbor 11(1) → different. Good.\n4: color 0. Neighbors 14(1),17(2),20(2),7(1),1(1) → all different. Good.\n5: color 1. Neighbor 2(0) → different. Good.\n6: color 0. Neighbors 15(1),22(1) → different. Good.\n7: color 1.

Good.\n15: color 1. Neighbors 6(0),8(0),17(2),20(2) → different. Good.\n16: color 1. Neighbor 12(0) → different. Good.\n17: color 2. Neighbors 7(1),15(1),4(0) → different. Good.\n18: color 2.

Node 8 is connected to 2,6,11,20,3 (degree 5). Node 9 is connected to 17,20,5,0,24 (degree 5). Node 12 is connected to 16,15,17 (degree 3). Node 17 is connected to 9,12,16 (degree 3). Node 7 is connected to 5,1,15 (degree 3). Node 5: 7,9,24 (degree 3). Node 0: 2,9,6 (degree 3). Node 2: 0,8,4,19 (degree 4). Node 3: 8,23 (degree 2). Node 6: 8,0 (degree 2). Node 11: 8,23 (degree 2). Node 20: 9,8 (degree 2). Node 23: 11,3 (degree 2). Node 24: 5,9 (degree 2). Nodes 1,4,10,13,14,15,16,18,19,21,22: degrees 1 or 0.\n\nSince we need 3 colors, let's start with the node with the highest degree. Let's pick node 8 first (degree 5). Its neighbors are 2,6,11,20,3. Let's color node 8 with color 0. Then its neighbors can't be 0.\n\nNode 2 is connected to 8,0,4,19. Let's color node 2 with color 1 (since 0 is taken by 8). Then node 0 (connected to 2,9,6) can't be 1. Let's check node 0's neighbors: 2 (1), 9 (unknown), 6 (unknown). Let's color node 0 with color 2. Then node 6 is connected to 0 (2) and 8 (0). So node 6 can be color 1 (since 0 and 2 are taken by neighbors 8 and 0). Node 6 is color 1.\n\nNode 4 is connected to 2 (1). So node 4 can be color 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. Node 19 is connected to 2 (1). So node 19 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 3 is connected to 8 (0) and 23 (unknown). So node 3 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Then node 23 is connected to 3 (1) and 11 (unknown). Let's check node 11: connected to 8 (0) and 23 (unknown). Node 11 can be 1 or 2. If node 3 is 1, then node 23 can't be 1. Let's color node 23 with 0. Then node 11 (connected to 8 (0) and 23 (0)) can't be 0, so node 11 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 2.\n\nNode 20 is connected to 8 (0) and 9 (unknown). So node 20 can be 1 or 2. Let's keep that in mind. Now, node 9 is connected to 17,20,5,0,24. Node 0 is color 2, so node 9 can't be 2. Let's look at node 9's neighbors: 0 (2), 20 (unknown), 5 (unknown), 17 (unknown), 24 (unknown). Let's try to color node 9 with 1. Then node 20 (connected to 8 (0) and 9 (1)) can be 2. That works (20 is 2). Node 5 is connected to 7,9 (1), 24 (unknown). So node 5 can't be 1. Let's color node 5 with 0. Then node 7 is connected to 5 (0), 1 (unknown), 15 (unknown). Node 7 can be 1 or 2. Let's color node 7 with 1. Then node 1 is connected to 7 (1), so node 1 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. Node 15 is connected to 7 (1) and 12 (unknown). Let's color node 15 with 0 (since 1 is taken by 7). Then node 12 is connected to 16,15 (0), 17 (unknown). Node 12 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Node 16 is connected to 12 (1) and 17 (unknown). Node 16 can be 0 or 2. Node 17 is connected to 9 (1), 12 (1), 16 (unknown). So node 17 can't be 1. If node 16 is 0, then node 17 is connected to 9 (1), 12 (1), 16 (0). So node 17 can be 2. That works: 17 is 2, 16 is 0.\n\nNode 24 is connected to 5 (0) and 9 (1). So node 24 can be 2. Good.\n\nNode 10 is connected to 21. Let's color node 10 with 0, then node 21 can be 1. Node 18 is connected to 22. Color node 18 with 0, node 22 with 1.\n\nIsolated nodes 13 and 14 can be colored with 0 (since they have no neighbors). Let's check all nodes:\n\n0: 2 (neighbors 2 (1), 9 (1), 6 (1) → all different. Good.\n1: 0 (neighbor 7 (1) → different. Good.\n2: 1 (neighbors 0 (2), 8 (0), 4 (0), 19 (0) → all different.

First, I need to list all the nodes and their edges to understand the structure. The nodes are 0 to 48. Let's start by identifying some nodes with high degrees or that are connected to many others, as they might be critical.\n\nLooking at node 0: connected to 8, 38, 13, 37, 15. So node 0 has edges to 8, 38, 13, 37, 15. Let's pick a color for node 0, say color 0. Then its neighbors 8, 38, 13, 37, 15 must be colored 1 or 2.\n\nNode 1: connected to 29, 16, 19, 25. Let's color node 1 with color 1. Then 29, 16, 19, 25 can't be 1.\n\nNode 2: connected to 28. Let's color node 2 with color 0. Then 28 can't be 0.\n\nNode 3: connected to 10, 11. Let's color node 3 with color 0. Then 10 and 11 can't be 0.\n\nNode 4: connected to 21, 8, 16. Node 4's neighbors are 21, 8, 16. Let's color node 4 with color 1. Then 21, 8, 16 can't be 1.\n\nNode 5: Wait, is node 5 connected to any edges? Let me check the edges list again. The edges are: 7-23, 15-30, 11-45, 3-10, 4-21, 6-36, 20-44, 0-8, 19-21, 10-18, 34-43, 22-47, 19-30, 0-38, 30-45, 33-41, 44-47, 43-45, 11-44, 4-8, 10-48, 26-35, 15-41, 12-24, 23-24, 9-10, 17-26, 0-13, 37-38, 12-39, 2-28, 1-29, 0-37, 24-34, 13-40, 3-11, 4-16, 13-46, 12-20, 23-26, 10-13, 7-48, 0-15, 19-22, 8-28, 1-16, 11-24, 11-30, 1-19, 1-25. Oh, node 5 isn't in any edge. So node 5 is an isolated node. It can be colored with any color, say 0.\n\nNode 6: connected to 36. Let's color node 6 with color 0. Then 36 can't be 0.\n\nNode 7: connected to 23, 48. Let's color node 7 with color 0. Then 23 and 48 can't be 0.\n\nNode 8: connected to 0, 4, 28. Node 0 is color 0, node 4 is color 1. So 8 can't be 0 or 1, so 8 must be color 2. Then 28 (connected to 8 and 2) can't be 2 (since 8 is 2) and 2 is color 0, so 28 can be 1.\n\nNode 9: connected to 10. Node 3 is 0, 10 is connected to 3, 10 is connected to 18, 48, 9, 13. Let's look at node 10. Node 3 (color 0) is connected to 10, so 10 can't be 0. Let's say 10 is color 1. Then 9 (connected to 10) can't be 1, so 9 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 10: color 1 (since 3 is 0, 9 is 0, 18, 48, 13 need to be checked later).\n\nNode 11: connected to 45, 3, 24, 30, 44. Node 3 is 0, so 11 can't be 0. Let's say 11 is color 1. Then 45, 24, 30, 44 can't be 1.\n\nNode 12: connected to 24, 39, 20. Let's color 12 with color 0. Then 24 (connected to 12, 23, 34, 11) can't be 0. 24 is connected to 11 (color 1), so 24 can be 2.\n\nNode 13: connected to 0, 40, 46, 10. Node 0 is 0, 10 is 1. So 13 can't be 0 or 1, so 13 must be 2. Then 40 and 46 (connected to 13) can't be 2. 40 can be 0 or 1; 46 same.\n\nNode 14: No edges? Let's check edges again. No, 14 isn't in any edge. So 14 is isolated. Color 0.\n\nNode 15: connected to 30, 41, 0. Node 0 is 0, so 15 can't be 0. Let's say 15 is color 1. Then 30 (connected to 15, 19, 45, 11) can't be 1. 30 is connected to 11 (color 1), so 30 can be 0 or 2.\n\nNode 16: connected to 4, 1. Node 4 is 1, 1 is 1. So 16 can't be 1. Let's color 16 with 0. Then 1 (color 1) is okay, 4 (color 1) is okay.\n\nNode 17: connected to 26. Let's color 17 with 0. Then 26 can't be 0.\n\nNode 18: connected to 10. 10 is color 1, so 18 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 19: connected to 21, 30, 22, 1. Node 1 is color 1, so 19 can't be 1. Let's color 19 with 0. Then 21 (connected to 19, 4) can't be 0. 4 is color 1, so 21 can be 2. 30 (connected to 19, 15, 45, 11) 19 is 0, 15 is 1, 11 is 1, so 30 can be 2 (since 11 is 1, 15 is 1, 19 is 0, 45 is connected to 11 (1) and 30 (2), so 45 can be 0).\n\nNode 20: connected to 44, 12. 12 is color 0, so 20 can't be 0. Let's color 20 with 1. Then 44 (connected to 20, 47, 11) 20 is 1, 11 is 1, so 44 can't be 1. 44 can be 0 or 2.\n\nNode 21: connected to 4, 19. 4 is 1, 19 is 0. So 21 can be 2 (as 4 is 1, 19 is 0, 21 is 2). That's good.\n\nNode 22: connected to 47, 19. 19 is 0, so 22 can't be 0. Let's color 22 with 1. Then 47 (connected to 22, 44) 22 is 1, 44 is (let's say 44 is 2, since 20 is 1, 11 is 1, 44 can be 2). So 47 is connected to 22 (1) and 44 (2), so 47 can be 0.\n\nNode 23: connected to 7, 24, 26. 7 is 0, 24 is 2 (from earlier), so 23 can't be 0 or 2. So 23 must be 1. Then 26 (connected to 23, 17, 35) 23 is 1, 17 is 0, so 26 can be 2.\n\nNode 24: connected to 12 (0), 23 (1), 34, 11 (1). 12 is 0, 23 is 1, 11 is 1. So 24 can be 2 (as 0 and 1 are taken by neighbors). That's what we had earlier.\n\nNode 25: connected to 1. 1 is color 1, so 25 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 26: connected to 23 (1), 17 (0), 35. 23 is 1, 17 is 0, so 26 can be 2. Then 35 (connected to 26) can't be 2, so 35 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 27: No edges? Let's check. 27 isn't in any edge. So 27 is isolated. Color 0.\n\nNode 28: connected to 2, 8. 2 is 0, 8 is 2. So 28 can be 1 (since 0 and 2 are taken). That's good.\n\nNode 29: connected to 1. 1 is 1, so 29 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 30: connected to 15 (1), 19 (0), 45, 11 (1). 15 is 1, 19 is 0, 11 is 1. So 30 can be 2 (since 0 and 1 are taken by neighbors). Then 45 (connected to 11 (1), 30 (2), 43) 11 is 1, 30 is 2, so 45 can be 0. 43 (connected to 34, 45) 45 is 0, so 43 can be 1 or 2.\n\nNode 31: No edges. Color 0.\n\nNode 32: No edges. Color 0.\n\nNode 33: connected to 41. Let's color 33 with 0. Then 41 (connected to 33, 15) 15 is 1, 33 is 0, so 41 can be 2.\n\nNode 34: connected to 43, 24. 24 is 2, so 34 can't be 2. Let's color 34 with 0. Then 43 (connected to 34 (0), 45 (0)) can be 1 or 2. 45 is 0, 34 is 0, so 43 can be 1.\n\nNode 35: connected to 26 (2). 26 is 2, so 35 can be 0 (as chosen earlier).\n\nNode 36: connected to 6 (0). So 36 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 37: connected to 38, 0. 0 is 0, so 37 can't be 0. 38 is connected to 0 (0) and 37. Let's color 37 with 1. Then 38 (connected to 0 (0), 37 (1)) can be 2.\n\nNode 38: connected to 0 (0), 37 (1). So 38 is 2.\n\nNode 39: connected to 12 (0). 12 is 0, so 39 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 40: connected to 13 (2). 13 is 2, so 40 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 41: connected to 33 (0), 15 (1). So 41 can be 2 (as 0 and 1 are taken).\n\nNode 42: No edges. Color 0.\n\nNode 43: connected to 34 (0), 45 (0). So 43 can be 1 (as 0 is taken by neighbors).\n\nNode 44: connected to 20 (1), 47, 11 (1). 20 is 1, 11 is 1, so 44 can't be 1. Let's color 44 with 2. Then 47 (connected to 44 (2), 22 (1)) can be 0.\n\nNode 45: connected to 11 (1), 30 (2), 43 (1). So 45 is 0 (as 1 and 2 are taken).\n\nNode 46: connected to 13 (2). 13 is 2, so 46 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 47: connected to 22 (1), 44 (2). So 47 is 0 (as 1 and 2 are taken).\n\nNode 48: connected to 10 (1), 7 (0). 10 is 1, 7 is 0, so 48 can be 2.\n\nLet me check some nodes to ensure no conflicts:\n\nNode 0 (0) neighbors: 8 (2), 38 (2), 13 (2), 37 (1), 15 (1) → all different from 0. Good.\n\nNode 1 (1) neighbors: 29 (0), 16 (0), 19 (0), 25 (0) → all different from 1. Good.\n\nNode 8 (2) neighbors: 0 (0), 4 (1), 28 (1) → 0,1,1. 2 is not among them. Good.\n\nNode 13 (2) neighbors: 0 (0), 40 (0), 46 (0), 10 (1) → 0,0,0,1. 2 is not among them. Good.\n\nNode 10 (1) neighbors: 3 (0), 18 (0), 48 (2), 9 (0), 13 (2) → 0,0,2,0,2. 1 is not among them.

Good.\n\nNode 30 (2) neighbors: 15 (1), 19 (0), 45 (0), 11 (1) → 1,0,0,1. 2 is not among them. Good.\n\nNode 44 (2) neighbors: 20 (1), 47 (0), 11 (1) → 1,0,1. 2 is not among them. Good.\n\nNode 47 (0) neighbors: 22 (1), 44 (2) → 1,2. 0 is not among them. Good.\n\nNode 48 (2) neighbors: 10 (1), 7 (0) → 1,0. 2 is not among them. Good.\n\nLooks like all neighbors have different colors. The isolated nodes (5,14,27,31,32,42) are colored 0, which is fine. Let's list all nodes:\n\n0:0, 1:1, 2:0, 3:0, 4:1, 5:0, 6:0, 7:0, 8:2, 9:0, 10:1, 11:1, 12:0, 13:2, 14:0, 15:1, 16:0, 17:0, 18:0, 19:0, 20:1, 21:2, 22:1, 23:1, 24:2, 25:0, 26:2, 27:0, 28:1, 29:0, 30:2, 31:0, 32:0, 33:0, 34:0, 35:0, 36:1, 37:1, 38:2, 39:1, 40:0, 41:2, 42:0, 43:1, 44:2, 45:0, 46:0, 47:0, 48:2.\n\nWait, let's check node 21: connected to 4 (1) and 19 (0). 21 is 2.

First, I need to list all the nodes and their edges. The nodes are 0-45. Let's start by identifying high-degree nodes or any obvious structures.\n\nLooking at the edges, node 12 is connected to 19, 31, 37, 33, 36, 26, 44, 0. That's 8 edges. Node 23 is connected to 40, 30, 19, 26, 41. Node 5 is connected to 7, 31, 21, 27. Node 44 is connected to 33, 35, 6, 41, 12. Node 43 is connected to 8, 32, 6, 39. Node 31 is connected to 12, 3, 5, 17. Node 37 is connected to 12, 42, 22. Node 42 is connected to 35, 37, 17, 16. Node 16 is connected to 28, 2, 42. Node 38 is connected to 7, 13, 15. Node 27 is connected to 19, 5, 11. Node 19 is connected to 12, 27, 23. Node 24 is connected to 30, 33, 18. Node 30 is connected to 24, 23. Node 32 is connected to 43, 36, 1. Node 33 is connected to 24, 44, 12. Node 36 is connected to 32, 12. Node 21 is connected to 5, 41. Node 41 is connected to 21, 44, 23. Node 6 is connected to 44, 43, 2. Node 2 is connected to 16, 6. Node 1 is connected to 20, 32, 10. Node 8 is connected to 43, 14. Node 14 is connected to 8. Node 3 is connected to 31. Node 17 is connected to 42, 31. Node 22 is connected to 37. Node 28 is connected to 16. Node 10 is connected to 1. Node 20 is connected to 1. Node 9 is connected to 0. Node 11 is connected to 27. Node 13 is connected to 38. Node 15 is connected to 38. Node 18 is connected to 40, 24. Node 40 is connected to 23, 18. Node 39 is connected to 43. \n\nLet's start with node 0. Let's color it 0. Its neighbor is 9, so 9 can't be 0. Let's color 9 as 1. Node 0 is also connected to 12 (from edge 0-12). So 12 can't be 0. Let's color 12 as 1. Now, 12's neighbors: 19, 31, 37, 33, 36, 26, 44, 0. So 19 can't be 1. Let's color 19 as 0. 19 is connected to 27 and 23. 27 can't be 0. 23 can't be 0. 27 is connected to 5 and 11. 5 is connected to 7, 31, 21, 27. Let's see 31, which is connected to 12 (color 1), 3, 5, 17. So 31 can't be 1. Let's color 31 as 0. Then 5, connected to 31 (0), 7, 21, 27. 5 can't be 0. Let's color 5 as 1. 5's neighbor 27 can't be 1 (since 5 is 1 and 27 is connected to 5). 27 is connected to 19 (0), 5 (1), 11. So 27 can be 2. 27's neighbor 11 can't be 2. Let's color 11 as 0. \n\nNow 12's neighbor 37: 12 is 1, so 37 can't be 1. 37 is connected to 42 and 22. Let's color 37 as 0. 42 is connected to 35, 37 (0), 17, 16. So 42 can't be 0. Let's color 42 as 1. 35 is connected to 42 (1) and 44. 35 can't be 1. Let's color 35 as 0. 44 is connected to 33, 35 (0), 6, 41, 12 (1). 44 can't be 0 or 1, so 44 must be 2. 44's neighbor 33: 12 is 1, 44 is 2. 33 is connected to 24 and 44 (2). So 33 can't be 2. 33 is connected to 12 (1), so 33 can't be 1. So 33 must be 0. 24 is connected to 30, 33 (0), 18. 24 can't be 0. Let's color 24 as 1. 30 is connected to 24 (1) and 23. 30 can't be 1. Let's color 30 as 0. 23 is connected to 40, 30 (0), 19 (0), 26, 41. 23 can't be 0. 23 is connected to 19 (0), 30 (0), so 23 can be 1 or 2. Let's check 41: 41 is connected to 21, 44 (2), 23. 41 can't be 2. 21 is connected to 5 (1) and 41. 21 can't be 1. Let's color 21 as 0. Then 41, connected to 21 (0), 44 (2), 23. 41 can't be 0 or 2, so 41 must be 1. Then 23, connected to 41 (1), can't be 1. So 23 must be 2. 23 is connected to 40, 30 (0), 19 (0), 26, 41 (1). 23 is 2, so 40 can't be 2. 40 is connected to 23 (2) and 18. Let's color 40 as 0. 18 is connected to 40 (0) and 24 (1). 18 can't be 0 or 1, so 18 is 2. \n\n12's neighbor 36: 12 is 1, 36 is connected to 32. 32 is connected to 43, 36, 1. Let's color 36. 12 is 1, 36 can't be 1. 32 is connected to 36, so 32 can't be the same as 36. Let's color 36 as 0. Then 32 can't be 0. 32 is connected to 43, 1. Let's color 32 as 1. 43 is connected to 8, 32 (1), 6, 39. 43 can't be 1. Let's color 43 as 0. 8 is connected to 43 (0) and 14. 8 can't be 0. Let's color 8 as 1. 14 is connected to 8 (1), so 14 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 14 as 0. 6 is connected to 44 (2), 43 (0), 2. 6 can't be 0 or 2. So 6 must be 1. 2 is connected to 16 and 6 (1). 2 can't be 1. Let's color 2 as 0. 16 is connected to 28, 2 (0), 42 (1). 16 can't be 0 or 1. So 16 is 2. 28 is connected to 16 (2), so 28 can be 0 or 1. Let's color 28 as 0. 42 is 1, 17 is connected to 42 (1) and 31 (0). 17 can't be 0 or 1, so 17 is 2. 31 is 0, 3 is connected to 31 (0), so 3 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 3 as 1. 22 is connected to 37 (0), so 22 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 22 as 1. 26 is connected to 12 (1) and 23 (2). 26 can't be 1 or 2, so 26 is 0. \n\n1's neighbors: 20, 32 (1), 10. 1 can't be 1. Let's color 1 as 0. 20 is connected to 1 (0), so 20 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 20 as 1. 10 is connected to 1 (0), so 10 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 10 as 2. 7 is connected to 5 (1) and 38. 5 is 1, so 7 can't be 1. Let's color 7 as 0. 38 is connected to 7 (0), 13, 15. 38 can't be 0. Let's color 38 as 1. 13 is connected to 38 (1), so 13 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 13 as 0. 15 is connected to 38 (1), so 15 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 15 as 2. 39 is connected to 43 (0), so 39 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 39 as 1. \n\nNow check if all nodes are colored. Let's list all nodes:\n\n0: 0 (connected to 9, 12) → 9 is 1, 12 is 1 → okay.\n1: 0 (connected to 20, 32, 10) → 20 is 1, 32 is 1, 10 is 2 → okay.\n2: 0 (connected to 16, 6) → 16 is 2, 6 is 1 → okay.\n3: 1 (connected to 31) → 31 is 0 → okay.\n4: Need to check. Wait, node 4: are there any edges for node 4? Let's check the edges list. The edges given are: 24-30, 8-43, 24-33, 32-43, 35-42, 12-19, 5-7, 7-38, 12-31, 12-37, 23-40, 3-31, 5-31, 37-42, 19-27, 17-42, 16-28, 32-36, 33-44, 13-38, 35-44, 15-38, 18-40, 23-30, 6-44, 12-33, 5-21, 22-37, 8-14, 12-36, 19-23, 5-27, 2-16, 1-20, 41-44, 1-32, 18-24, 16-42, 12-26, 23-26, 0-9, 6-43, 39-43, 21-41, 0-12, 2-6, 17-31, 23-41, 1-10, 12-44, 11-27. No edges mention node 4. So node 4 is an isolated node. So it can be colored with any color. Let's color 4 as 0.\n\n5: 1 (connected to 7, 31, 21, 27) → 7 is 0, 31 is 0, 21 is 0, 27 is 2 → okay.\n6: 1 (connected to 44, 43, 2) → 44 is 2, 43 is 0, 2 is 0 → okay.\n7: 0 (connected to 5, 38) → 5 is 1, 38 is 1 → okay.\n8: 1 (connected to 43, 14) → 43 is 0, 14 is 0 → okay.\n9: 1 (connected to 0) → 0 is 0 → okay.\n10: 2 (connected to 1) → 1 is 0 → okay.\n11: 0 (connected to 27) → 27 is 2 → okay.\n12: 1 (connected to 19, 31, 37, 33, 36, 26, 44, 0) → 19 is 0, 31 is 0, 37 is 0, 33 is 0, 36 is 0, 26 is 0, 44 is 2, 0 is 0 → okay.\n13: 0 (connected to 38) → 38 is 1 → okay.\n14: 0 (connected to 8) → 8 is 1 → okay.\n15: 2 (connected to 38) → 38 is 1 → okay.\n16: 2 (connected to 28, 2, 42) → 28 is 0, 2 is 0, 42 is 1 → okay.\n17: 2 (connected to 42, 31) → 42 is 1, 31 is 0 → okay.\n18: 2 (connected to 40, 24) → 40 is 0, 24 is 1 → okay.\n19: 0 (connected to 12, 27, 23) → 12 is 1, 27 is 2, 23 is 2 → okay.\n20: 1 (connected to 1) → 1 is 0 → okay.\n21: 0 (connected to 5, 41) → 5 is 1, 41 is 1 → okay.\n22: 1 (connected to 37) → 37 is 0 → okay.\n23: 2 (connected to 40, 30, 19, 26, 41) → 40 is 0, 30 is 0, 19 is 0, 26 is 0, 41 is 1 → okay.\n24: 1 (connected to 30, 33, 18) → 30 is 0, 33 is 0, 18 is 2 → okay.\n25: Another isolated node (no edges).

First, I need to list all the nodes and their edges to understand the structure. The nodes are 0-29. Let's start by identifying nodes with high degrees, as they might be trickier.\n\nLooking at the edges: Let's list connections for each node.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 6, 18, 2, 17, 26, 7, 19. So node 1 has edges to 6,18,2,17,26,7,19. That's 7 edges, so high degree.\n\nNode 17 is connected to 21,9,13,4,1,26,22. So 17 is connected to 21,9,13,4,1,26,22. Also high degree.\n\nNode 18 is connected to 20,1,3,12,2. So 18 is connected to 20,1,3,12,2. Degree 5.\n\nNode 20 is connected to 7,18,6,12. Degree 4.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 15,1,20. Degree 3.\n\nNode 2: connected to 1,7,13,18. Degree 4.\n\nNode 13: connected to 9,17,24,2. Degree 4.\n\nNode 26: connected to 17,21,1. Degree 3.\n\nNode 7: connected to 20,2,1. Degree 3.\n\nNode 3: connected to 18,5,11. Degree 3.\n\nNode 12: connected to 18,20. Degree 2.\n\nNode 4: connected to 27,17. Degree 2.\n\nNode 5: connected to 3. Degree 1.\n\nNode 11: connected to 3. Degree 1.\n\nNode 9: connected to 17,13. Degree 2.\n\nNode 21: connected to 17,26. Degree 2.\n\nNode 22: connected to 17. Degree 1.\n\nNode 19: connected to 1. Degree 1.\n\nNode 15: connected to 6. Degree 1.\n\nNode 24: connected to 13. Degree 1.\n\nNode 27: connected to 4. Degree 1.\n\nNodes 0, 8, 10, 23, 25, 28: Wait, looking at the edges provided, do these nodes have any edges? Let me check again. The edges are:\n\n6-15, 16-29, 7-20, 18-20, 17-21, 4-27, 1-6, 9-17, 1-18, 13-17, 6-20, 3-18, 12-18, 4-17, 1-2, 9-13, 17-26, 2-7, 2-13, 1-17, 1-26, 3-5, 3-11, 21-26, 12-20, 17-22, 1-7, 2-18, 1-19, 13-24.\n\nSo nodes 0, 8, 10, 23, 25, 28 are not mentioned in any edges. So they are isolated. That's important! So these nodes can be colored with any color, since they have no neighbors.\n\nSo first, handle the connected components. The main component is the one including node 1, which is connected to many others. Then there are isolated nodes (0,8,10,23,25,28), and other small components: 16-29 (a pair), 5-3-11 (3 connected to 5 and 11), 4-27 (4 connected to 27), 15-6 (6 connected to 15 and others), 22-17 (22 connected to 17), 19-1 (19 connected to 1), 24-13 (24 connected to 13), 21-17-26-21 (21 connected to 17 and 26, 26 connected to 17 and 21), 9-13-2-7-20-18-1-... etc.\n\nLet's start with the main component. Let's pick node 1 first. Let's color node 1 with color 0.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 6,18,2,17,26,7,19. So all these neighbors must be colored 1 or 2.\n\nLet's look at node 2, connected to 1 (0), 7,13,18. Let's color node 2 with color 1.\n\nNode 7 is connected to 1 (0), 2 (1), 20. So node 7 can't be 0 or 1, so color 2.\n\nNode 20 is connected to 7 (2), 18, 6, 12. Let's color node 20. Let's see 18 is connected to 1 (0), 2 (1), 3, 12, 20. Let's color node 18. Since 18 is connected to 1 (0) and 2 (1), so 18 can be 2.\n\nSo node 18: 2. Then node 20 is connected to 18 (2), 7 (2), 6, 12. So 20 can't be 2. Let's check 6: 6 is connected to 1 (0), 20, 15. Let's color 6. 6 is connected to 1 (0), so 6 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Then 6:1. Then 20 is connected to 6 (1) and 7 (2), 18 (2). So 20 can't be 1 or 2. So 20 must be 0. That works. So node 20:0.\n\nNode 12 is connected to 18 (2) and 20 (0). So 12 can be 1. So node 12:1.\n\nNode 3 is connected to 18 (2), 5, 11. Let's color node 3. 18 is 2, so 3 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0. Then node 3:0. Then node 5 is connected to 3 (0), so 5 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Node 5:1. Node 11 is connected to 3 (0), so 11 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 2. Node 11:2.\n\nNode 13 is connected to 2 (1), 9, 17, 24. Let's color node 13. 2 is 1, so 13 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. Node 13:0.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 13 (0) and 17. So 9 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Node 9:1.\n\nNode 17 is connected to 21,9 (1),13 (0),4,1 (0),26,22. So 17 is connected to 9 (1) and 13 (0) and 1 (0). So 17 can't be 0 or 1, so color 2. Node 17:2.\n\nNode 21 is connected to 17 (2) and 26. So 21 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0. Node 21:0.\n\nNode 26 is connected to 17 (2), 21 (0), 1 (0). So 26 is connected to 1 (0) and 17 (2) and 21 (0). So 26 can be 1. Node 26:1.\n\nNode 4 is connected to 17 (2) and 27. So 4 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0. Node 4:0. Then node 27 is connected to 4 (0), so 27 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Node 27:1.\n\nNode 22 is connected to 17 (2). So 22 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0. Node 22:0.\n\nNode 19 is connected to 1 (0). So 19 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Node 19:1.\n\nNode 24 is connected to 13 (0). So 24 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Node 24:1.\n\nNode 15 is connected to 6 (1). So 15 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. Node 15:0.\n\nNow, the isolated nodes: 0,8,10,23,25,28. They can be colored with any color. Let's color them all with 0, but wait, we need to use exactly 3 colors. Wait, the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\". So all three colors (0,1,2) must be used in the coloring. Since the main component already uses 0,1,2 (node 1 is 0, node 2 is 1, node 7 is 2, etc.), the isolated nodes can be colored with any of the colors. Let's check if all three colors are present. For example, node 1 is 0, node 2 is 1, node 7 is 2. So yes, all three colors are used. So the isolated nodes can be colored with 0,1,2 as needed, but since they don't conflict, we can assign any. Let's assign 0 to 0, 1 to 8, 2 to 10, 0 to 23, 1 to 25, 2 to 28.\n\nNow, check the pair 16-29. They are connected, so they need different colors. Let's color 16 with 0, 29 with 1.\n\nLet's verify all edges:\n\nCheck 6-15: 6 is 1, 15 is 0 → ok.\n\n16-29: 16 is 0, 29 is 1 → ok.\n\n7-20: 7 is 2, 20 is 0 → ok.\n\n18-20: 18 is 2, 20 is 0 → ok.\n\n17-21: 17 is 2, 21 is 0 → ok.\n\n4-27: 4 is 0, 27 is 1 → ok.\n\n1-6: 1 is 0, 6 is 1 → ok.\n\n9-17: 9 is 1, 17 is 2 → ok.\n\n1-18: 1 is 0, 18 is 2 → ok.\n\n13-17: 13 is 0, 17 is 2 → ok.\n\n6-20: 6 is 1, 20 is 0 → ok.\n\n3-18: 3 is 0, 18 is 2 → ok.\n\n12-18: 12 is 1, 18 is 2 → ok.\n\n4-17: 4 is 0, 17 is 2 → ok.\n\n1-2: 1 is 0, 2 is 1 → ok.\n\n9-13: 9 is 1, 13 is 0 → ok.\n\n17-26: 17 is 2, 26 is 1 → ok.\n\n2-7: 2 is 1, 7 is 2 → ok.\n\n2-13: 2 is 1, 13 is 0 → ok.\n\n1-17: 1 is 0, 17 is 2 → ok.\n\n1-26: 1 is 0, 26 is 1 → ok.\n\n3-5: 3 is 0, 5 is 1 → ok.\n\n3-11: 3 is 0, 11 is 2 → ok.\n\n21-26: 21 is 0, 26 is 1 → ok.\n\n12-20: 12 is 1, 20 is 0 → ok.\n\n17-22: 17 is 2, 22 is 0 → ok.\n\n1-7: 1 is 0, 7 is 2 → ok.\n\n2-18: 2 is 1, 18 is 2 → ok.\n\n1-19: 1 is 0, 19 is 1 → ok.\n\n13-24: 13 is 0, 24 is 1 → ok.\n\nAll edges have different colors. Now, check all nodes:\n\n0:0, 1:0, 2:1, 3:0, 4:0, 5:1, 6:1, 7:2, 8:1, 9:1, 10:2, 11:2, 12:1, 13:0, 14:? Wait, node 14 is not mentioned in edges. Oh, right! The nodes are 0-29, but in the edges, I missed node 14. So node 14 is also isolated. Oh, I need to include all nodes. Let's check the original node list: Nodes: 0,1,...,29. So 30 nodes. Let's list all 30 nodes:\n\n0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo node 14 is isolated. I forgot that. So node 14 is isolated. So color node 14 with 2 (to use all colors, but since we already have 0,1,2, it's okay).\n\nSo let's list all nodes and their colors:\n\n0:0 (isolated)\n\n1:0\n\n2:1\n\n3:0\n\n4:0\n\n5:1\n\n6:1\n\n7:2\n\n8:1 (isolated)\n\n9:1\n\n10:2 (isolated)\n\n11:2\n\n12:1\n\n13:0\n\n14:2 (isolated)\n\n15:0 (connected to 6)\n\n16:0 (connected to 29)\n\n17:2\n\n18:2\n\n19:1 (connected to 1)\n\n20:0\n\n21:0\n\n22:0 (connected to 17)\n\n23:0 (isolated)\n\n24:1 (connected to 13)\n\n25:1 (isolated)\n\n26:1\n\n27:1 (connected to 4)\n\n28:2 (isolated)\n\n29:1 (connected to 16)\n\nWait, 16-29: 16 is 0, 29 is 1 → ok.\n\nCheck node 14: color 2.\n\nLet me list all:\n\n0:0\n\n1:0\n\n2:1\n\n3:0\n\n4:0\n\n5:1\n\n6:1\n\n7:2\n\n8:1\n\n9:1\n\n10:2\n\n11:2\n\n12:1\n\n13:0\n\n14:2\n\n15:0\n\n16:0\n\n17:2\n\n18:2\n\n19:1\n\n20:0\n\n21:0\n\n22:0\n\n23:0\n\n24:1\n\n25:1\n\n26:1\n\n27:1\n\n28:2\n\n29:1\n\nCheck if any adjacent nodes have the same color. Let's recheck a few:\n\nNode 1 (0) connected to 6 (1), 18 (2), 2 (1), 17 (2), 26 (1), 7 (2), 19 (1) → all different.

The goal is to color all 24 nodes using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2) such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. First, I need to understand the structure of the graph by listing all the edges and identifying the adjacency list for each node.\n\nLet me start by compiling the adjacency list. Each node's neighbors are the nodes it's connected to via edges. Let's list them out:\n\n- Node 0: connected to 14, 22 (edges 0-14, 0-22)\n- Node 1: connected to 2, 10 (edges 1-2, 1-10)\n- Node 2: connected to 1, 17, 12, 15 (edges 1-2, 2-17, 2-12, 2-15)\n- Node 3: connected to 21, 8 (edges 3-21, 3-8)\n- Node 4: connected to 12, 19, 7 (edges 4-12, 4-19, 4-7)\n- Node 5: Wait, the edges listed don't include node 5. Let me check again. The edges given are: 6-18, 16-20, 4-12, 12-19, 0-14, 2-17, 7-22, 12-15, 14-15, 3-21, 1-2, 0-22, 6-16, 7-15, 4-7, 6-22, 3-8, 12-23, 12-20, 4-19, 8-16, 2-12, 1-10, 2-15, 13-15. Oh right, node 5 isn't connected to any other node. So node 5 is an isolated node.\n- Node 6: connected to 18, 16, 22 (edges 6-18, 6-16, 6-22)\n- Node 7: connected to 22, 15, 4 (edges 7-22, 7-15, 4-7)\n- Node 8: connected to 3, 16 (edges 3-8, 8-16)\n- Node 9: Also not in any edges. So node 9 is isolated.\n- Node 10: connected to 1 (edge 1-10)\n- Node 11: Not in any edges. Isolated.\n- Node 12: connected to 4, 19, 15, 23, 20, 2 (edges 4-12, 12-19, 12-15, 12-23, 12-20, 2-12)\n- Node 13: connected to 15 (edge 13-15)\n- Node 14: connected to 0, 15 (edges 0-14, 14-15)\n- Node 15: connected to 12, 14, 7, 2, 13 (edges 12-15, 14-15, 7-15, 2-15, 13-15)\n- Node 16: connected to 20, 6, 8 (edges 16-20, 6-16, 8-16)\n- Node 17: connected to 2 (edge 2-17)\n- Node 18: connected to 6 (edge 6-18)\n- Node 19: connected to 12, 4 (edges 12-19, 4-19)\n- Node 20: connected to 16, 12 (edges 16-20, 12-20)\n- Node 21: connected to 3 (edge 3-21)\n- Node 22: connected to 7, 0, 6 (edges 7-22, 0-22, 6-22)\n- Node 23: connected to 12 (edge 12-23)\n\nSo isolated nodes are 5, 9, 11. They can be colored with any color, but since we need exactly 3 colors, we should assign each of them different colors if possible, but since they have no neighbors, their color doesn't affect others. But let's focus on the connected components first.\n\nFirst, let's identify connected components. The main connected component (since most nodes are connected) and the isolated ones.\n\nIsolated nodes: 5, 9, 11.\n\nNow, let's look at the main component. Let's list all nodes that are connected via edges: 0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,10,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23. Let's confirm connectivity. For example, 0 is connected to 14 and 22. 14 is connected to 15, which is connected to 12, 7, 2, 13. 12 is connected to 4, 19, 20, 23, 2. 2 is connected to 1, 17. 1 is connected to 10. 4 is connected to 7. 7 is connected to 22. 22 is connected to 6. 6 is connected to 18, 16. 16 is connected to 8, 20. 8 is connected to 3. 3 is connected to 21. So yes, all these nodes are in one connected component.\n\nNow, the key is to color this component with 3 colors. Let's start by choosing a node and assign a color, then proceed to neighbors, ensuring no conflicts.\n\nLet's start with node 15, as it has many neighbors (12,14,7,2,13). Let's assign color 0 to node 15.\n\nNeighbors of 15: 12,14,7,2,13. They can't be 0.\n\nNode 12: connected to 15 (0), so can't be 0. Let's assign 1.\n\nNode 14: connected to 15 (0), so can't be 0. Let's assign 1.\n\nNode 7: connected to 15 (0), so can't be 0. Let's assign 1.\n\nNode 2: connected to 15 (0), so can't be 0. Let's assign 1.\n\nNode 13: connected to 15 (0), so can't be 0. Let's assign 1.\n\nNow, node 12 (color 1) has neighbors: 4,19,23,20,2 (which is 1). So 4,19,23,20 can't be 1.\n\nNode 4: connected to 12 (1) and 7 (1) and 19. So 4 can't be 1. Let's assign 0.\n\nNode 19: connected to 12 (1) and 4 (0). So 19 can't be 1 or 0. So must be 2.\n\nNode 23: connected to 12 (1). Assign 0.\n\nNode 20: connected to 12 (1) and 16. Assign 0.\n\nNode 2 (color 1) has neighbors: 1,17,12 (1),15 (0). So 1 and 17 can't be 1.\n\nNode 1: connected to 2 (1) and 10. Assign 0.\n\nNode 17: connected to 2 (1). Assign 0.\n\nNode 10: connected to 1 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode 14 (color 1) has neighbor 0. So 0 can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\nNode 0 (color 0) has neighbors 14 (1) and 22. So 22 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 22 (color 1) has neighbors 7 (1), 0 (0), 6. So 7 is 1, 0 is 0. So 6 can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\nNode 6 (color 0) has neighbors 18,16,22 (1). So 18 and 16 can't be 0.\n\nNode 18: connected to 6 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode 16 (color 1) has neighbors 20 (0), 6 (0), 8. So 8 can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\nNode 8 (color 0) has neighbors 3 and 16 (1). So 3 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 3 (color 1) has neighbor 21. So 21 can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\nNode 7 (color 1) has neighbors 22 (1), 15 (0), 4 (0). So 7 is 1, which is okay (neighbors are 1,0,0; 1 is allowed as 7's color is 1, but 22 is 1—wait, 7 is connected to 22. Oh! 7 and 22 are connected. So 7 is 1, 22 is 1—this is a conflict. Oh no, I made a mistake here.\n\nLet's backtrack. Node 22 is connected to 7. So when I assigned 22 to color 1, 7 is also 1. That's invalid. So I need to fix that.\n\nLet's redo node 22. Node 0 is color 0, 22 is connected to 0 (so can't be 0) and 6, and 7. 7 is connected to 15 (0) and 4. Let's adjust 7's color.\n\nEarlier, 15 is 0. 7 is a neighbor of 15, so 7 can't be 0. Let's assign 7 to color 2 instead of 1. Then 7's color is 2.\n\nThen node 22 is connected to 0 (0), 7 (2), and 6. So 22 can't be 0 or 2. So 22 must be 1. That works.\n\nNow, node 7 is 2. Let's check 7's neighbors: 22 (1), 15 (0), 4. 4 is connected to 12 (1) and 19. Let's re-examine 4. 4 is connected to 12 (1) and 7 (2). So 4 can't be 1 or 2. So 4 must be 0.\n\n4's color is 0. Then 19 is connected to 4 (0) and 12 (1). So 19 can't be 0 or 1. So 19 must be 2.\n\n12's neighbors: 4 (0), 19 (2), 23, 20, 2 (1). So 12 is 1, which is okay.\n\nNode 23: connected to 12 (1). Assign 0.\n\nNode 20: connected to 12 (1) and 16. Assign 0.\n\nNode 2 (color 1) has neighbors 1,17,12 (1),15 (0). 1 can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\nNode 17: connected to 2 (1). Assign 0.\n\nNode 10: connected to 1 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode 14 (color 1) has neighbor 0. 0 can't be 1. Assign 0. Correct, 0 is 0.\n\nNode 22 is 1. 22's neighbors: 0 (0), 7 (2), 6. 6 can't be 1 (since 22 is 1). So 6 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\n6's neighbors: 18,16,22 (1). 18 and 16 can't be 0.\n\nNode 18: connected to 6 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode 16: connected to 6 (0) and 20 (0), 8. 16 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 8: connected to 16 (1) and 3. 8 can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\nNode 3: connected to 8 (0) and 21. 3 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 21: connected to 3 (1). Assign 0.\n\nNow check node 16 (1) and 20 (0). 16 is connected to 20, which is 0—okay.\n\nNode 12 (1) and 20 (0): connected—okay.\n\nNode 12 (1) and 23 (0): connected—okay.\n\nNode 4 (0) and 12 (1): connected—okay.\n\nNode 4 (0) and 19 (2): connected—okay.\n\nNode 19 (2) and 12 (1): connected—okay.\n\nNode 7 (2) and 4 (0): connected—okay.\n\nNode 7 (2) and 15 (0): connected—okay.\n\nNode 7 (2) and 22 (1): connected—okay.\n\nNode 22 (1) and 0 (0): connected—okay.\n\nNode 22 (1) and 6 (0): connected—okay.\n\nNode 6 (0) and 18 (1): connected—okay.\n\nNode 6 (0) and 16 (1): connected—okay.\n\nNode 16 (1) and 8 (0): connected—okay.\n\nNode 8 (0) and 3 (1): connected—okay.\n\nNode 3 (1) and 21 (0): connected—okay.\n\nNode 2 (1) and 1 (0): connected—okay.\n\nNode 2 (1) and 17 (0): connected—okay.\n\nNode 2 (1) and 12 (1): Oh! Node 2 is connected to 12. Both are color 1. That's a conflict. Oh no, I missed that edge. Let's check the edges again. Edge list includes 2-12. Yes, 2 is connected to 12. So node 2 (1) and node 12 (1) are adjacent. That's invalid.\n\nNeed to fix that. Let's adjust node 2's color. Node 2 is connected to 15 (0), 12 (1), 1 (0), 17. So 2 can't be 0 (because 15 is 0) or 1 (because 12 is 1). So 2 must be 2.\n\nSo node 2 is 2. Then node 2's neighbors: 1 (can't be 2), 17 (can't be 2), 12 (1), 15 (0).\n\nNode 1: connected to 2 (2). Assign 0.\n\nNode 17: connected to 2 (2). Assign 0.\n\nNode 12 is 1, 15 is 0—okay.\n\nNow node 1 (0) is connected to 10. Assign 10 to 1.\n\nNode 10 (1) is connected to 1 (0)—okay.\n\nNode 2 (2) and 12 (1): connected—okay.\n\nNow, node 12 (1) has neighbors: 4 (0), 19 (2), 23 (0), 20 (0), 2 (2). All different from 1—good.\n\nNode 15 (0) has neighbors: 12 (1), 14 (1), 7 (2), 2 (2), 13 (1). All different from 0—good.\n\nNode 14 (1) is connected to 0 (0) and 15 (0)—okay.\n\nNode 0 (0) is connected to 14 (1) and 22 (1)—okay.\n\nNode 22 (1) is connected to 0 (0), 7 (2), 6 (0)—okay.\n\nNode 6 (0) is connected to 18 (1), 16 (1), 22 (1)—okay.\n\nNode 18 (1) is connected to 6 (0)—okay.\n\nNode 16 (1) is connected to 6 (0), 20 (0), 8 (0)—okay.\n\nNode 8 (0) is connected to 16 (1) and 3 (1)—okay.\n\nNode 3 (1) is connected to 8 (0) and 21 (0)—okay.\n\nNode 21 (0) is connected to 3 (1)—okay.\n\nNode 7 (2) is connected to 15 (0), 4 (0), 22 (1)—okay.\n\nNode 4 (0) is connected to 12 (1), 19 (2), 7 (2)—okay.\n\nNode 19 (2) is connected to 4 (0) and 12 (1)—okay.\n\nNode 20 (0) is connected to 12 (1) and 16 (1)—okay.\n\nNode 23 (0) is connected to 12 (1)—okay.\n\nNode 13 (1) is connected to 15 (0)—okay.\n\nNow, let's check isolated nodes 5,9,11. They can be colored with any color. Since we need to use exactly 3 colors, let's assign 5 to 0, 9 to 1, 11 to 2. That way all three colors are used.\n\nLet's list all nodes:\n\n0: 0\n\n1: 0\n\nWait, node 1 was assigned 0. Let's check node 1's neighbors. Node 1 is connected to 2 (2) and 10 (1). So 1's color is 0—okay.\n\nNode 2: 2\n\nNode 3: 1\n\nNode 4: 0\n\nNode 5: 0 (isolated)\n\nNode 6: 0\n\nNode 7: 2\n\nNode 8: 0\n\nNode 9: 1 (isolated)\n\nNode 10: 1\n\nNode 11: 2 (isolated)\n\nNode 12: 1\n\nNode 13: 1\n\nNode 14: 1\n\nNode 15: 0\n\nNode 16: 1\n\nNode 17: 0\n\nNode 18: 1\n\nNode 19: 2\n\nNode 20: 0\n\nNode 21: 0\n\nNode 22: 1\n\nNode 23: 0\n\nWait, let's verify each node's color and neighbors:\n\nNode 0: color 0. Neighbors 14 (1), 22 (1) → okay.\n\nNode 1: color 0. Neighbors 2 (2), 10 (1) → okay.\n\nNode 2: color 2. Neighbors 1 (0), 17 (0), 12 (1), 15 (0) → okay.\n\nNode 3: color 1. Neighbors 21 (0), 8 (0) → okay.\n\nNode 4: color 0. Neighbors 12 (1), 19 (2), 7 (2) → okay.\n\nNode 5: color 0. No neighbors → okay.\n\nNode 6: color 0. Neighbors 18 (1), 16 (1), 22 (1) → okay.\n\nNode 7: color 2. Neighbors 22 (1), 15 (0), 4 (0) → okay.\n\nNode 8: color 0. Neighbors 3 (1), 16 (1) → okay.\n\nNode 9: color 1. No neighbors → okay.\n\nNode 10: color 1. Neighbor 1 (0) → okay.\n\nNode 11: color 2. No neighbors → okay.\n\nNode 12: color 1. Neighbors 4 (0), 19 (2), 23 (0), 20 (0), 2 (2) → okay.\n\nNode 13: color 1. Neighbor 15 (0) → okay.\n\nNode 14: color 1. Neighbors 0 (0), 15 (0) → okay.\n\nNode 15: color 0. Neighbors 12 (1), 14 (1), 7 (2), 2 (2), 13 (1) → okay.\n\nNode 16: color 1. Neighbors 20 (0), 6 (0), 8 (0) → okay.\n\nNode 17: color 0. Neighbor 2 (2) → okay.\n\nNode 18: color 1. Neighbor 6 (0) → okay.\n\nNode 19: color 2. Neighbors 12 (1), 4 (0) → okay.\n\nNode 20: color 0. Neighbors 16 (1), 12 (1) → okay.\n\nNode 21: color 0. Neighbor 3 (1) → okay.\n\nNode 22: color 1. Neighbors 7 (2), 0 (0), 6 (0) → okay.\n\nNode 23: color 0. Neighbor 12 (1) → okay.\n\nAll adjacent nodes have different colors. And we used all three colors (0,1,2).

These can be colored with any color, since they have no neighbors. Let's assign them color 0 first, but maybe adjust later.\n\nNext, let's find the maximum degree to check if 3 colors are possible. The graph is undirected, so degree is the number of edges per node.\n\nLet's compute degrees:\n\n0: 3 (26,38,21)\n1: 2 (34,15)\n2: 4 (36,38,12,24)\n3: 3 (7,24,17)\n4: 2 (37,26)\n5: 5 (37,8,17,32,38) → degree 5\n6: 1 (24)\n7: 4 (3,25,37,27)\n8: 4 (11,32,31,5)\n9: 2 (11,17)\n10: 3 (15,27,28)\n11: 2 (9,8)\n12: 3 (25,34,2)\n13: 2 (25,18)\n14: 1 (26)\n15: 2 (10,1)\n16: 0\n17: 5 (21,9,23,3,5) → degree 5\n18: 1 (13)\n19: 0\n20: 0\n21: 3 (17,35,0)\n22: 0\n23: 1 (17)\n24: 3 (6,3,2)\n25: 3 (12,7,13)\n26: 3 (0,4,14)\n27: 2 (10,7)\n28: 1 (10)\n29: 1 (32)\n30: 0\n31: 2 (8,36)\n32: 3 (29,8,5)\n33: 0\n34: 2 (1,12)\n35: 2 (38,21)\n36: 2 (2,31)\n37: 3 (4,5,7)\n38: 4 (0,2,35,5)\n\nSo nodes 5 and 17 have degree 5. But since we're using 3 colors, we need to check if the graph is 3-colorable. If it's a planar graph, 4 colors suffice, but 3 may be possible. Let's proceed.\n\nLet's start with node 5, which has high degree. Its neighbors are 37,8,17,32,38. Let's assign color 0 to node 5. Then its neighbors (37,8,17,32,38) can't be 0.\n\nNode 17's neighbors: 21,9,23,3,5 (5 is 0). So 17 can't be 0 (since 5 is 0). Let's assign 17 color 1. Then 21,9,23,3 can't be 1.\n\nNode 3: neighbors 7,24,17 (17 is 1). So 3 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 7: neighbors 3 (0),25,37,27. So 7 can't be 0. Let's say 1.\n\nNode 25: neighbors 12,7 (1),13. 25 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 12: neighbors 25 (0),34,2. 12 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 1.\n\nNode 34: neighbors 1,12 (1). 34 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 1: neighbors 34 (0),15. 1 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 1.\n\nNode 15: neighbors 10,1 (1). 15 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 10: neighbors 15 (0),27,28. 10 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 1.\n\nNode 27: neighbors 10 (1),7 (1). 27 can't be 1. So 0 or 2. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 28: neighbor 10 (1). 28 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 8: neighbors 11,32,31,5 (0). 8 can't be 0. Let's say 1.\n\nNode 11: neighbors 9,8 (1). 11 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 9: neighbors 11 (0),17 (1). 9 can be 2 (since 0 and 1 are used by neighbors). So 9 is 2.\n\nNode 32: neighbors 29,8 (1),5 (0). 32 can't be 0 or 1. So 2.\n\nNode 29: neighbor 32 (2). 29 can be 0 or 1. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 31: neighbors 8 (1),36. 31 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 36: neighbors 2,31 (0). 36 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 1.\n\nNode 2: neighbors 36 (1),38,12 (1),24. 2 can't be 1. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 38: neighbors 0,2 (0),35,5 (0). 38 can't be 0. Let's say 1.\n\nNode 35: neighbors 38 (1),21. 35 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 21: neighbors 17 (1),35 (0),0. 21 can be 2 (since 1 and 0 are used). So 21 is 2.\n\nNode 0: neighbors 26,38 (1),21 (2). 0 can be 0 (since 1 and 2 are used by neighbors). So 0 is 0.\n\nNode 26: neighbors 0 (0),4,14. 26 can't be 0. Let's say 1.\n\nNode 4: neighbor 37,26 (1). 4 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 37: neighbors 4 (0),5 (0),7 (1). 37 can't be 0 or 1. So 2.\n\nNode 14: neighbor 26 (1). 14 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 24: neighbors 6,3 (0),2 (0). 24 can't be 0. Let's say 1.\n\nNode 6: neighbor 24 (1). 6 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 23: neighbor 17 (1). 23 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 18: neighbor 13. 18 can be 0,1,2. Let's check 13.\n\nNode 13: neighbor 25 (0),18. 13 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 1. Then 18 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0.\n\nNow, isolated nodes: 16,19,20,22,30,33. They can be any color. Let's assign them 0,1,2,0,1,2 respectively.\n\nLet's list all nodes and their colors:\n\n0: 0 (from above)\n1: 1\n2: 0\n3: 0\n4: 0\n5: 0\n6: 0\n7: 1\n8: 1\n9: 2\n10: 1\n11: 0\n12: 1\n13: 1\n14: 0\n15: 0\n16: 0 (isolated)\n17: 1\n18: 0\n19: 1 (isolated)\n20: 2 (isolated)\n21: 2\n22: 0 (isolated)\n23: 0\n24: 1\n25: 0\n26: 1\n27: 0\n28: 0\n29: 0\n30: 1 (isolated)\n31: 0\n32: 2\n33: 2 (isolated)\n34: 0\n35: 0\n36: 1\n37: 2\n38: 1\n\nWait, let's check some conflicts:\n\nNode 5 (color 0) neighbors: 37 (2),8 (1),17 (1),32 (2),38 (1) → no conflict.\n\nNode 17 (color 1) neighbors: 21 (2),9 (2),23 (0),3 (0),5 (0) → no conflict.\n\nNode 3 (color 0) neighbors: 7 (1),24 (1),17 (1) → no conflict.\n\nNode 7 (color 1) neighbors: 3 (0),25 (0),37 (2),27 (0) → no conflict.\n\nNode 25 (color 0) neighbors: 12 (1),7 (1),13 (1) → no conflict.\n\nNode 12 (color 1) neighbors: 25 (0),34 (0),2 (0) → no conflict.\n\nNode 34 (color 0) neighbors: 1 (1),12 (1) → no conflict.\n\nNode 1 (color 1) neighbors: 34 (0),15 (0) → no conflict.\n\nNode 15 (color 0) neighbors: 10 (1),1 (1) → no conflict.\n\nNode 10 (color 1) neighbors: 15 (0),27 (0),28 (0) → no conflict.\n\nNode 27 (color 0) neighbors: 10 (1),7 (1) → no conflict.\n\nNode 28 (color 0) neighbor 10 (1) → okay.\n\nNode 8 (color 1) neighbors: 11 (0),32 (2),31 (0),5 (0) → no conflict.\n\nNode 11 (color 0) neighbors: 9 (2),8 (1) → no conflict.\n\nNode 9 (color 2) neighbors: 11 (0),17 (1) → no conflict.\n\nNode 32 (color 2) neighbors: 29 (0),8 (1),5 (0) → no conflict.\n\nNode 29 (color 0) neighbor 32 (2) → okay.\n\nNode 31 (color 0) neighbors: 8 (1),36 (1) → no conflict.\n\nNode 36 (color 1) neighbors: 2 (0),31 (0) → no conflict.\n\nNode 2 (color 0) neighbors: 36 (1),38 (1),12 (1),24 (1) → no conflict.\n\nNode 38 (color 1) neighbors: 0 (0),2 (0),35 (0),5 (0) → no conflict.\n\nNode 35 (color 0) neighbors: 38 (1),21 (2) → no conflict.\n\nNode 21 (color 2) neighbors: 17 (1),35 (0),0 (0) → no conflict.\n\nNode 0 (color 0) neighbors: 26 (1),38 (1),21 (2) → no conflict.\n\nNode 26 (color 1) neighbors: 0 (0),4 (0),14 (0) → no conflict.\n\nNode 4 (color 0) neighbors: 37 (2),26 (1) → no conflict.\n\nNode 37 (color 2) neighbors: 4 (0),5 (0),7 (1) → no conflict.\n\nNode 14 (color 0) neighbor 26 (1) → okay.\n\nNode 24 (color 1) neighbors: 6 (0),3 (0),2 (0) → no conflict.\n\nNode 6 (color 0) neighbor 24 (1) → okay.\n\nNode 23 (color 0) neighbor 17 (1) → okay.\n\nNode 13 (color 1) neighbors: 25 (0),18 (0) → no conflict.\n\nNode 18 (color 0) neighbor 13 (1) → okay.\n\nIsolated nodes (16,19,20,22,30,33) have no neighbors, so their colors are fine.\n\nLooks like all conflicts are avoided.

The goal is to color all 46 nodes (0-45) with exactly 3 colors (0,1,2) such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. First, I need to understand the structure of the graph by looking at the edges provided.\n\nLet me list out all the edges to see the connections:\n\n0-36, 0-37\n2-33, 2-23, 2-24\n16-29\n24-36, 24-26\n35-42\n12-19, 12-10\n20-32, 20-15, 20-31\n4-15, 4-30, 4-34\n23-34, 23-8, 23-2 (from 2-23)\n8-15, 8-23, 8-26\n22-38, 22-27\n27-28, 27-30, 27-22\n28-39, 28-26, 28-6\n4-30 (already listed), 10-12, 10-14, 10-41\n9-17, 9-5, 9-7\n15-4, 15-8, 15-20, 15-26, 15-29, 15-43\n26-24, 26-15, 26-8, 26-28\n19-12, 19-42, 19-31\n13-29\n37-41, 37-0\n7-9\n38-22, 38-23, 38-42\n17-9, 17-31\n31-20, 31-19, 31-17\n18-43\n11-43\n42-35, 42-19, 42-38\n6-28\n39-28\n34-23, 34-4\n32-20\n33-2\n43-15, 43-18, 43-11\n41-37, 41-10\n\nNow, let's identify nodes with high degrees to start coloring. For example, node 15 is connected to 4,8,20,26,29,43. That's 6 edges, so high degree. Node 26 is connected to 24,15,8,28 (4 edges). Node 28 is connected to 27,26,6,39 (4 edges). Node 23 is connected to 2,34,8,38 (4 edges). Node 10 is connected to 12,14,41 (3 edges). Node 9 is connected to 5,7,17 (3 edges). \n\nLet's start with node 0. It's connected to 36 and 37. Let's color 0 with color 0. Then 36 and 37 can't be 0. Let's say 36 is 1, 37 is 2.\n\nNode 1: Let's check its neighbors. Wait, the edges don't list node 1 connected to anyone. So node 1 is an isolated node. It can be colored with any color. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 2: connected to 33,23,24. Let's color 2 with 0. Then 33,23,24 can't be 0. 33 is only connected to 2, so 33 can be 1. 23 is connected to 2,34,8,38. So 23 can't be 0. Let's say 23 is 1. Then 34 (connected to 23 and 4) can't be 1. 24 is connected to 2,36,26. 24 can't be 0 (from 2) and 36 is 1, so 24 can't be 1. So 24 must be 2.\n\nNode 3: Also, edges don't mention node 3. So isolated. Color 0.\n\nNode 4: connected to 15,30,34. 15's color is unknown yet. 34 is connected to 23 (1) and 4. Let's assume 4 is 0. Then 34 can't be 0. 34 is connected to 23 (1), so 34 can be 2. 30 is connected to 4 (0) and 27. So 30 can't be 0. 27 is connected to 28,30,22. Let's keep 30 in mind.\n\nNode 5: connected to 9. 9 is connected to 5,7,17. Let's color 5 with 0. Then 9 can't be 0. 9 can be 1. Then 7 (connected to 9) can't be 1. 7 can be 0. 17 (connected to 9) can't be 1. 17 is connected to 31. 31 is connected to 20,19,17. Let's say 17 is 0. Then 31 can't be 0. 31 is connected to 20 and 19. Let's see 20: connected to 15,32,31. 20 can be 0. Then 32 (connected to 20) can't be 0. 32 can be 1. 31 (connected to 20) can't be 0. 31 is connected to 19 (color unknown) and 17 (0). So 31 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 31 is 1. Then 19 (connected to 31) can't be 1. 19 is connected to 12 and 42. 12 is connected to 19 and 10. 10 is connected to 12,14,41. Let's color 12 with 0. Then 19 can't be 0 (from 12). 19 is connected to 31 (1), so 19 can be 2. 42 is connected to 35,19,38. 19 is 2, so 42 can't be 2. 38 is connected to 22,23,42. 23 is 1, so 38 can't be 1. Let's say 38 is 0. Then 42 can't be 0 (from 38) and 2 (from 19), so 42 must be 1. 35 is connected to 42 (1), so 35 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 35 is 0.\n\nNode 6: connected to 28. 28 is connected to 27,26,6,39. Let's color 6 with 0. Then 28 can't be 0. 28 is connected to 26. 26 is connected to 24 (2),15,8,28. 24 is 2, so 26 can't be 2. Let's say 26 is 0. Then 28 can't be 0 (from 26). 28 can be 1. 39 is connected to 28 (1), so 39 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 39 is 0.\n\nNode 7: connected to 9 (1), so 7 can be 0 (as before).\n\nNode 8: connected to 15,23,26. 23 is 1, 26 is 0. So 8 can't be 1 or 0. 8 must be 2.\n\nNode 9: connected to 5 (0),7 (0),17 (0). So 9 is 1 (as before).\n\nNode 10: connected to 12 (0),14,41. 12 is 0, so 10 can't be 0. Let's say 10 is 1. Then 14 (connected to 10) can't be 1. 14 can be 0 or 2. 41 is connected to 37 (2) and 10 (1). 37 is 2, 10 is 1, so 41 can be 0.\n\nNode 11: connected to 43. 43 is connected to 15,18,11. Let's color 11 with 0. Then 43 can't be 0. 43 is connected to 15 and 18. 15's color is needed. Let's get back to 15.\n\nNode 12: connected to 10 (1) and 19 (2), so 12 is 0 (as before).\n\nNode 13: connected to 29. 29 is connected to 16,13,15. 15 is connected to 4,8,20,26,29,43. 15's neighbors: 4 (0),8 (2),20 (0),26 (0),29 (unknown),43 (unknown). So 15 can't be 0 (from 4,20,26), 2 (from 8). So 15 must be 1. Then 29 (connected to 15) can't be 1. 29 is connected to 16 and 13. Let's say 29 is 0. Then 13 can be 1 (since connected to 29 (0)), and 16 can be 1 (connected to 29 (0)).\n\nNode 14: connected to 10 (1). So 14 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 15: color 1 (as above).\n\nNode 16: connected to 29 (0). So 16 can be 1 (as before).\n\nNode 17: connected to 9 (1) and 31 (1). 17 is 0 (as before).\n\nNode 18: connected to 43. 43 is connected to 15 (1),18,11 (0). 43 can't be 0 (from 11) or 1 (from 15). So 43 must be 2. Then 18 (connected to 43 (2)) can be 0 or 1. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 19: connected to 12 (0) and 31 (1), 42 (1). 19 is 2 (as before).\n\nNode 20: connected to 15 (1),32,31 (1). 20 is 0 (as before). 32 is connected to 20 (0), so 32 can be 1.\n\nNode 21: Not in any edges. Isolated. Color 0.\n\nNode 22: connected to 38 (0) and 27. 38 is 0, so 22 can't be 0. 27 is connected to 22,28 (1),30. Let's say 22 is 1. Then 27 (connected to 22 (1)) can't be 1. 27 is connected to 28 (1) and 30. 28 is 1, so 27 can't be 1. 27 can be 0 or 2. 30 is connected to 4 (0) and 27. Let's say 27 is 2. Then 30 (connected to 27 (2)) can't be 2. 30 is connected to 4 (0), so 30 can be 1.\n\nNode 23: connected to 2 (0),34 (2),8 (2),38 (0). 23 is 1 (as before).\n\nNode 24: connected to 2 (0),36 (1),26 (0). 24 is 2 (as before).\n\nNode 25: No edges. Isolated. Color 0.\n\nNode 26: connected to 24 (2),15 (1),8 (2),28 (1). 26 is 0 (as before).\n\nNode 27: connected to 22 (1),28 (1),30 (1). 27 is 2 (as before).\n\nNode 28: connected to 27 (2),26 (0),6 (0),39 (0). 28 is 1 (as before).\n\nNode 29: connected to 16 (1),13 (1),15 (1). 29 is 0 (as before).\n\nNode 30: connected to 4 (0),27 (2). 30 is 1 (as before).\n\nNode 31: connected to 20 (0),19 (2),17 (0). 31 is 1 (as before).\n\nNode 32: connected to 20 (0). 32 is 1 (as before).\n\nNode 33: connected to 2 (0). 33 is 1 (as before).\n\nNode 34: connected to 23 (1),4 (0). 34 is 2 (as before).\n\nNode 35: connected to 42 (1). 35 is 0 (as before).\n\nNode 36: connected to 0 (0),24 (2). 36 is 1 (as before).\n\nNode 37: connected to 0 (0),41 (0). 37 is 2 (as before). 41 is connected to 37 (2) and 10 (1). So 41 is 0 (as before).\n\nNode 38: connected to 22 (1),23 (1),42 (1). 38 is 0 (as before).\n\nNode 39: connected to 28 (1). 39 is 0 (as before).\n\nNode 40: No edges. Isolated. Color 0.\n\nNode 41: connected to 37 (2),10 (1). 41 is 0 (as before).\n\nNode 42: connected to 35 (0),19 (2),38 (0). 42 is 1 (as before).\n\nNode 43: connected to 15 (1),18 (0),11 (0). 43 is 2 (as before).\n\nNode 44: No edges. Isolated. Color 0.\n\nNode 45: No edges. Isolated. Color 0.\n\nNow let's verify some critical nodes:\n\n- Node 15 (color 1) is connected to 4 (0),8 (2),20 (0),26 (0),29 (0),43 (2). All different from 1. Good.\n\n- Node 26 (color 0) connected to 24 (2),15 (1),8 (2),28 (1). All different from 0. Good.\n\n- Node 28 (color 1) connected to 27 (2),26 (0),6 (0),39 (0). All different from 1. Good.\n\n- Node 23 (color 1) connected to 2 (0),34 (2),8 (2),38 (0). All different from 1. Good.\n\n- Node 24 (color 2) connected to 2 (0),36 (1),26 (0). All different from 2. Good.\n\n- Node 37 (color 2) connected to 0 (0),41 (0). All different from 2. Good.\n\n- Node 42 (color 1) connected to 35 (0),19 (2),38 (0). All different from 1. Good.\n\n- Node 43 (color 2) connected to 15 (1),18 (0),11 (0). All different from 2. Good.\n\nIsolated nodes (1,3,21,25,40,44,45) can be color 0, which is fine.\n\nThis seems to work. Let's list all nodes with their colors:\n\n0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:0, 8:2, 9:1, 10:1, 11:0, 12:0, 13:1, 14:0, 15:1, 16:1, 17:0, 18:0, 19:2, 20:0, 21:0, 22:1, 23:1, 24:2, 25:0, 26:0, 27:2, 28:1, 29:0, 30:1, 31:1, 32:1, 33:1, 34:2, 35:0, 36:1, 37:2, 38:0, 39:0, 40:0, 41:0, 42:1, 43:2, 44:0, 45:0.\n\nWait, but some nodes might have conflicts. Let's check node 8: color 2. Connected to 15 (1),23 (1),26 (0). All different from 2. Good.\n\nNode 19: color 2. Connected to 12 (0),42 (1),31 (1). All different from 2. Good.\n\nNode 27: color 2.

The goal is to color 38 nodes (0-37) with exactly 3 colors (0,1,2) such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. First, I need to understand the graph structure by looking at the edges provided. Let's list out all the edges to see the connections:\n\nEdges:\n6-18, 16-20, 3-4, 7-26, 29-35, 20-29, 4-24, 12-37, 17-21, 5-19, 8-15, 4-36, 1-18, 5-34, 1-15, 11-32, 14-18, 0-1, 12-33, 3-30, 4-26, 9-19, 17-26, 12-36, 28-32, 24-25, 0-31, 11-31, 2-25, 6-25, 6-28, 12-35, 14-32, 0-6, 3-29, 2-12, 28-37, 5-29, 5-35, 0-21, 11-30, 10-28, 0-33\n\nFirst, let's find the adjacency list for each node. That might help in determining the order to color the nodes, maybe using a greedy approach.\n\nLet's start building the adjacency list:\n\nNode 0: connected to 1, 31, 6, 21, 33 (edges 0-1, 0-31, 0-6, 0-21, 0-33)\nNode 1: connected to 0, 18, 15 (edges 0-1, 1-18, 1-15)\nNode 2: connected to 25, 12 (edges 2-25, 2-12)\nNode 3: connected to 4, 30, 29 (edges 3-4, 3-30, 3-29)\nNode 4: connected to 3, 24, 36, 26 (edges 3-4, 4-24, 4-36, 4-26)\nNode 5: connected to 19, 34, 29, 35 (edges 5-19, 5-34, 5-29, 5-35)\nNode 6: connected to 18, 25, 28, 0 (edges 6-18, 6-25, 6-28, 0-6)\nNode 7: connected to 26 (edge 7-26)\nNode 8: connected to 15 (edge 8-15)\nNode 9: connected to 19 (edge 9-19)\nNode 10: connected to 28 (edge 10-28)\nNode 11: connected to 32, 31, 30 (edges 11-32, 11-31, 11-30)\nNode 12: connected to 37, 33, 36, 35, 2, 12-33, 12-36, 12-35, 2-12 (edges 12-37, 12-33, 12-36, 12-35, 2-12)\nNode 13: No edges listed? Let's check. The edges provided don't include 13. So node 13 is isolated.\nNode 14: connected to 18, 32 (edges 14-18, 14-32)\nNode 15: connected to 8, 1 (edges 8-15, 1-15)\nNode 16: connected to 20 (edge 16-20)\nNode 17: connected to 21, 26 (edges 17-21, 17-26)\nNode 18: connected to 6, 1, 14 (edges 6-18, 1-18, 14-18)\nNode 19: connected to 5, 9 (edges 5-19, 9-19)\nNode 20: connected to 16, 29 (edges 16-20, 20-29)\nNode 21: connected to 17, 0 (edges 17-21, 0-21)\nNode 22: No edges listed. Isolated.\nNode 23: No edges listed. Isolated.\nNode 24: connected to 4, 25 (edges 4-24, 24-25)\nNode 25: connected to 24, 2, 6 (edges 24-25, 2-25, 6-25)\nNode 26: connected to 7, 4, 17 (edges 7-26, 4-26, 17-26)\nNode 27: No edges listed. Isolated.\nNode 28: connected to 32, 6, 37, 10 (edges 28-32, 6-28, 28-37, 10-28)\nNode 29: connected to 35, 20, 3, 5 (edges 29-35, 20-29, 3-29, 5-29)\nNode 30: connected to 3, 11 (edges 3-30, 11-30)\nNode 31: connected to 0, 11 (edges 0-31, 11-31)\nNode 32: connected to 11, 28, 14 (edges 11-32, 28-32, 14-32)\nNode 33: connected to 12, 0 (edges 12-33, 0-33)\nNode 34: connected to 5 (edge 5-34)\nNode 35: connected to 29, 12, 5 (edges 29-35, 12-35, 5-35)\nNode 36: connected to 4, 12 (edges 4-36, 12-36)\nNode 37: connected to 12, 28 (edges 12-37, 28-37)\n\nSo nodes 13, 22, 23, 27 are isolated. They can be colored with any color, but since we need exactly 3 colors, we need to make sure all three colors are used. But since there are 38 nodes, and 4 isolated, even if we color them with 0,1,2,0, the rest can cover the colors.\n\nNow, let's start coloring. Let's pick an order. Maybe start with node 0, then its neighbors, etc.\n\nNode 0's neighbors: 1,31,6,21,33. Let's color node 0 first. Let's choose color 0 for node 0.\n\nNode 0: [0,0]\n\nNode 1 is connected to 0. So can't be 0. Let's color 1 with 1. [1,1]\n\nNode 31 is connected to 0. Can't be 0. Let's color 31 with 1. [31,1]\n\nNode 6 is connected to 0. Can't be 0. Let's color 6 with 1. [6,1]\n\nNode 21 is connected to 0. Can't be 0. Let's color 21 with 1. [21,1]\n\nNode 33 is connected to 0. Can't be 0. Let's color 33 with 1. [33,1]\n\nNow node 1's neighbors: 0 (0), 18, 15. Node 1 is 1, so 18 and 15 can't be 1.\n\nNode 18: connected to 6 (1), 1 (1), 14. So 18 can't be 1. Let's color 18 with 0. [18,0]\n\nNode 15: connected to 8, 1 (1). So 15 can't be 1. Let's color 15 with 0. [15,0]\n\nNode 8 is connected to 15 (0). So 8 can't be 0. Let's color 8 with 1. [8,1]\n\nNode 14 is connected to 18 (0), 32. 14 can't be 0. Let's color 14 with 1. [14,1]\n\nNode 32 is connected to 11, 28, 14 (1). So 32 can't be 1. Let's color 32 with 0. [32,0]\n\nNode 11 is connected to 32 (0), 31 (1), 30. So 11 can't be 0 or 1. So 11 must be 2. [11,2]\n\nNode 30 is connected to 3, 11 (2). So 30 can't be 2. Let's color 30 with 0. [30,0]\n\nNode 3 is connected to 4, 30 (0), 29. So 3 can't be 0. Let's color 3 with 1. [3,1]\n\nNode 29 is connected to 35, 20, 3 (1), 5. So 29 can't be 1. Let's color 29 with 0. [29,0]\n\nNode 20 is connected to 16, 29 (0). So 20 can't be 0. Let's color 20 with 1. [20,1]\n\nNode 16 is connected to 20 (1). So 16 can't be 1. Let's color 16 with 0. [16,0]\n\nNode 35 is connected to 29 (0), 12, 5. So 35 can't be 0. Let's color 35 with 1. [35,1]\n\nNode 5 is connected to 19, 34, 29 (0), 35 (1). So 5 can't be 0 or 1. So 5 must be 2. [5,2]\n\nNode 19 is connected to 5 (2), 9. So 19 can't be 2. Let's color 19 with 0. [19,0]\n\nNode 9 is connected to 19 (0). So 9 can't be 0. Let's color 9 with 1. [9,1]\n\nNode 34 is connected to 5 (2). So 34 can't be 2. Let's color 34 with 0. [34,0]\n\nNode 12 is connected to 37, 33 (1), 36, 35 (1), 2. So 12 can't be 1. Let's color 12 with 0. [12,0]\n\nNode 2 is connected to 25, 12 (0). So 2 can't be 0. Let's color 2 with 1. [2,1]\n\nNode 25 is connected to 24, 2 (1), 6 (1). So 25 can't be 1. Let's color 25 with 0. [25,0]\n\nNode 24 is connected to 4, 25 (0). So 24 can't be 0. Let's color 24 with 1. [24,1]\n\nNode 4 is connected to 3 (1), 24 (1), 36, 26. So 4 can't be 1. Let's color 4 with 0. [4,0]\n\nNode 36 is connected to 4 (0), 12 (0). So 36 can't be 0. Let's color 36 with 1. [36,1]\n\nNode 26 is connected to 7, 4 (0), 17. So 26 can't be 0. Let's color 26 with 1. [26,1]\n\nNode 17 is connected to 21 (1), 26 (1). So 17 can't be 1. Let's color 17 with 0. [17,0]\n\nNode 7 is connected to 26 (1). So 7 can't be 1. Let's color 7 with 0. [7,0]\n\nNode 28 is connected to 32 (0), 6 (1), 37, 10. So 28 can't be 0 or 1. Let's color 28 with 2. [28,2]\n\nNode 37 is connected to 12 (0), 28 (2). So 37 can't be 0 or 2. Let's color 37 with 1. [37,1]\n\nNode 10 is connected to 28 (2). So 10 can't be 2. Let's color 10 with 0. [10,0]\n\nNow, check the isolated nodes: 13, 22, 23, 27. We need to use all 3 colors. Let's color 13 with 0, 22 with 1, 23 with 2, 27 with 0 (since 0 is already used, but it's allowed as long as they are not adjacent, which they aren't).\n\nSo node 13: [13,0], node 22: [22,1], node 23: [23,2], node 27: [27,0]\n\nNow let's verify all nodes:\n\n0:0 (neighbors 1,31,6,21,33 are 1,1,1,1,1: okay)\n1:1 (neighbors 0:0, 18:0, 15:0: okay)\n2:1 (neighbors 25:0, 12:0: okay)\n3:1 (neighbors 4:0, 30:0, 29:0: okay)\n4:0 (neighbors 3:1, 24:1, 36:1, 26:1: okay)\n5:2 (neighbors 19:0, 34:0, 29:0, 35:1: okay)\n6:1 (neighbors 18:0, 25:0, 28:2, 0:0: okay)\n7:0 (neighbor 26:1: okay)\n8:1 (neighbor 15:0: okay)\n9:1 (neighbor 19:0: okay)\n10:0 (neighbor 28:2: okay)\n11:2 (neighbors 32:0, 31:1, 30:0: okay)\n12:0 (neighbors 37:1, 33:1, 36:1, 35:1, 2:1: okay)\n13:0 (no neighbors: okay)\n14:1 (neighbors 18:0, 32:0: okay)\n15:0 (neighbors 8:1, 1:1: okay)\n16:0 (neighbor 20:1: okay)\n17:0 (neighbors 21:1, 26:1: okay)\n18:0 (neighbors 6:1, 1:1, 14:1: okay)\n19:0 (neighbors 5:2, 9:1: okay)\n20:1 (neighbors 16:0, 29:0: okay)\n21:1 (neighbors 17:0, 0:0: okay)\n22:1 (no neighbors: okay)\n23:2 (no neighbors: okay)\n24:1 (neighbors 4:0, 25:0: okay)\n25:0 (neighbors 24:1, 2:1, 6:1: okay)\n26:1 (neighbors 7:0, 4:0, 17:0: okay)\n27:0 (no neighbors: okay)\n28:2 (neighbors 32:0, 6:1, 37:1, 10:0: okay)\n29:0 (neighbors 35:1, 20:1, 3:1, 5:2: okay)\n30:0 (neighbors 3:1, 11:2: okay)\n31:1 (neighbors 0:0, 11:2: okay)\n32:0 (neighbors 11:2, 28:2, 14:1: okay)\n33:1 (neighbors 12:0, 0:0: okay)\n34:0 (neighbor 5:2: okay)\n35:1 (neighbors 29:0, 12:0, 5:2: okay)\n36:1 (neighbors 4:0, 12:0: okay)\n37:1 (neighbors 12:0, 28:2: okay)\n\nAll adjacent nodes have different colors. And we used colors 0,1,2 (e.g., node 5 is 2, node 11 is 2, node 28 is 2, node 23 is 2; node 0 is 0, etc.).

We need to color 40 nodes with 3 colors (0, 1, 2) such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. First, I should start by understanding the graph structure. Let's list out the edges and see which nodes are connected.\n\nFirst, let's list all edges to get adjacency lists:\n\nEdges:\n2-27, 24-27, 2-33, 0-39, 25-38, 1-34, 4-12, 35-39, 3-10, 29-38, 5-25, 1-3, 17-30, 0-23, 8-27, 16-22, 7-19, 32-36, 7-28, 24-38, 26-38, 23-24, 5-12, 20-34, 1-11, 9-28, 3-36, 10-23, 5-27, 1-14, 15-16, 10-35, 21-23, 21-32, 22-33, 14-32, 23-32, 14-35, 5-32, 9-24, 13-21.\n\nLet me start by building adjacency lists for each node. That might help in determining the order to color nodes, perhaps starting with high-degree nodes.\n\nLet's list adjacency for each node:\n\n0: 39, 23\n1: 34, 3, 11, 14\n2: 27, 33\n3: 10, 1, 36\n4: 12\n5: 25, 12, 27, 32\n6: (no edges listed? Let me check. The edges given don't mention 6. So node 6 has no edges. That's an isolated node.)\n7: 19, 28\n8: 27\n9: 28, 24\n10: 3, 23, 35\n11: 1\n12: 4, 5\n13: 21\n14: 1, 32, 35\n15: 16\n16: 15, 22\n17: 30\n18: (no edges? Check again. Edges don't include 18. So node 18 is isolated.)\n19: 7\n20: 34\n21: 23, 32, 13\n22: 16, 33\n23: 0, 24, 10, 21, 32\n24: 27, 38, 23, 9\n25: 38, 5\n26: 38\n27: 2, 24, 8, 5\n28: 7, 9\n29: 38\n30: 17\n31: (no edges. Isolated.)\n32: 36, 21, 14, 23, 5\n33: 2, 22\n34: 1, 20\n35: 39, 10, 14\n36: 32, 3\n37: (no edges. Isolated.)\n38: 25, 29, 24, 26\n39: 0, 35\n\nSo nodes 6, 18, 31, 37 are isolated (degree 0). They can be colored with any color, since they have no neighbors.\n\nNow, let's look for nodes with high degrees. Let's check:\n\nNode 23: connected to 0,24,10,21,32 → degree 5\nNode 32: connected to 36,21,14,23,5 → degree 5\nNode 24: connected to 27,38,23,9 → degree 4\nNode 5: connected to 25,12,27,32 → degree 4\nNode 10: connected to 3,23,35 → degree 3\nNode 35: connected to 39,10,14 → degree 3\nNode 3: connected to 10,1,36 → degree 3\nNode 1: connected to 34,3,11,14 → degree 4\nNode 27: connected to 2,24,8,5 → degree 4\nNode 38: connected to 25,29,24,26 → degree 4\nNode 21: connected to 23,32,13 → degree 3\nNode 14: connected to 1,32,35 → degree 3\nNode 36: connected to 32,3 → degree 2\nNode 2: connected to 27,33 → degree 2\nNode 33: connected to 2,22 → degree 2\nNode 22: connected to 16,33 → degree 2\nNode 16: connected to 15,22 → degree 2\nNode 15: connected to 16 → degree 1\nNode 8: connected to 27 → degree 1\nNode 9: connected to 28,24 → degree 2\nNode 28: connected to 7,9 → degree 2\nNode 7: connected to 19,28 → degree 2\nNode 19: connected to 7 → degree 1\nNode 30: connected to 17 → degree 1\nNode 17: connected to 30 → degree 1\nNode 20: connected to 34 → degree 1\nNode 34: connected to 1,20 → degree 2\nNode 11: connected to 1 → degree 1\nNode 4: connected to 12 → degree 1\nNode 12: connected to 4,5 → degree 2\nNode 25: connected to 38,5 → degree 2\nNode 26: connected to 38 → degree 1\nNode 29: connected to 38 → degree 1\nNode 0: connected to 39,23 → degree 2\nNode 39: connected to 0,35 → degree 2\nNode 13: connected to 21 → degree 1\n\nSo the highest degree nodes are 23 and 32 with degree 5. Let's start with those.\n\nLet's try to color node 23 first. Let's assign color 0.\n\nNode 23: 0\n\nIts neighbors are 0,24,10,21,32. So these nodes can't be 0.\n\nNext, node 32: neighbors are 36,21,14,23,5. 23 is 0, so 32 can't be 0. Let's assign 1.\n\nNode 32: 1\n\nNeighbors of 32: 36,21,14,23 (0),5. So 36,21,14,5 can't be 1.\n\nNode 24: neighbor of 23 (0) and 27,38,9. Let's color 24. Since 23 is 0, 24 can be 1 or 2. Let's check 24's other neighbors. 27: connected to 2,24,8,5. 38: connected to 25,29,24,26. 9: connected to 28,24. Let's pick 24 as 1.\n\nNode 24: 1\n\nNow, 27 is a neighbor of 24 (1), 2,8,5. So 27 can't be 1. Let's color 27. 27's neighbors: 2 (unknown), 24 (1), 8 (unknown), 5 (unknown). Let's see 5: connected to 25,12,27,32 (1). So 5 can't be 1 (since 32 is 1). 5 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 5 is 0. Then 27 can't be 0 (since 5 is 0) or 1 (since 24 is 1). So 27 must be 2.\n\nNode 5: 0 → 27: 2 (since 5 is 0, 24 is 1, 27 can't be 0 or 1)\n\nNode 27: 2\n\nNow, 2 is connected to 27 (2) and 33. So 2 can't be 2. Let's color 2. 2's neighbors: 27 (2) and 33 (unknown). So 2 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 2: 0\n\nThen 33 is connected to 2 (0) and 22. 33 can't be 0. Let's color 33. 33's neighbor 22 is connected to 16 and 33. 22 can't be 0 (from 33's color if 33 is 1 or 2). Let's pick 33 as 1. Then 22 can't be 1.\n\nNode 33: 1\n\nNode 22 is connected to 16 and 33 (1). So 22 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 22 is 0.\n\nNode 22: 0\n\n16 is connected to 15 and 22 (0). So 16 can't be 0. 16 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 16: 1\n\n15 is connected to 16 (1). So 15 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 15: 0\n\nNow, 10 is connected to 3,23 (0),35. 10 can't be 0 (since 23 is 0). Let's color 10. 10's neighbors: 3 (unknown), 23 (0), 35 (unknown). Let's pick 10 as 1.\n\nNode 10: 1\n\n3 is connected to 10 (1),1,36. 3 can't be 1. Let's color 3. 3's neighbors: 10 (1), 1 (unknown), 36 (unknown). Let's pick 3 as 0.\n\nNode 3: 0\n\n36 is connected to 32 (1) and 3 (0). So 36 can't be 1 or 0. So 36 must be 2.\n\nNode 36: 2\n\nNow, 32 is 1, 3 is 0, 36 is 2. That works.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 34,3 (0),11,14. 1 can't be 0 (since 3 is 0). Let's color 1. 1's neighbors: 34 (unknown), 3 (0), 11 (unknown), 14 (unknown). Let's pick 1 as 1.\n\nNode 1: 1\n\n34 is connected to 1 (1) and 20. So 34 can't be 1. Let's color 34. 34's neighbor 20 is connected to 34. Let's pick 34 as 0. Then 20 can't be 0.\n\nNode 34: 0\n\n20 is connected to 34 (0). So 20 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 20: 1\n\n11 is connected to 1 (1). So 11 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 11: 0\n\n14 is connected to 1 (1), 32 (1), 35. 14 can't be 1 (since 1 and 32 are 1). So 14 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 14: 0\n\n35 is connected to 39,10 (1),14 (0). 35 can't be 1 or 0. So 35 must be 2.\n\nNode 35: 2\n\n39 is connected to 0 and 35 (2). 39 can't be 2. Let's color 39. 39's neighbor 0 is connected to 39 and 23 (0). 0 can't be 0 (since 23 is 0). So 0 can be 1 or 2. Let's see 39: 0's neighbor is 39. If 0 is 1, then 39 can't be 1 (since 0 is 1). 39 can be 0 or 2. But 35 is 2, so 39 is connected to 35 (2), so 39 can't be 2. So 39 can be 0.\n\nLet's set 0: 1. Then 39 can't be 1. 39 is connected to 35 (2), so 39 can't be 2. So 39 must be 0.\n\nNode 0: 1 → 39: 0\n\nCheck 0's neighbors: 39 (0) and 23 (0). 0 is 1, which is okay. 39 is 0, connected to 0 (1) and 35 (2) → okay.\n\nNow, 21 is connected to 23 (0), 32 (1), 13. 21 can't be 0 or 1. So 21 must be 2.\n\nNode 21: 2\n\n13 is connected to 21 (2). So 13 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 13: 0\n\nNow, 25 is connected to 38 and 5 (0). 25 can't be 0. Let's color 25. 25's neighbor 38 is connected to 25,29,24 (1),26. 24 is 1, so 38 can't be 1. Let's color 25 first. 25 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 25: 1 → 38 is connected to 25 (1),29,24 (1),26. So 38 can't be 1. 38's other neighbors: 29,26. Let's color 38. 38 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 38: 0\n\n29 is connected to 38 (0). So 29 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 29: 1\n\n26 is connected to 38 (0). So 26 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 26: 1\n\nNow, 9 is connected to 28 and 24 (1). 9 can't be 1. Let's color 9. 9's neighbor 28 is connected to 7 and 9. 7 is connected to 19 and 28. Let's color 9. 9 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 9: 0 → 28 is connected to 7 and 9 (0). 28 can't be 0. 28's neighbor 7 is connected to 19 and 28. Let's color 28. 28 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 28: 1 → 7 is connected to 19 and 28 (1). 7 can't be 1. Let's color 7. 7 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 7: 0 → 19 is connected to 7 (0). 19 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 19: 1\n\nNow, 12 is connected to 4 and 5 (0). 12 can't be 0. Let's color 12. 12 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 12: 1 → 4 is connected to 12 (1). 4 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 4: 0\n\nNow, 8 is connected to 27 (2). So 8 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 8: 0\n\n17 is connected to 30. Let's color 17 and 30. 17 can be 0, 30 can be 1 (since they are connected). 17: 0, 30:1.\n\nNode 17: 0 → 30:1 (since 17 is 0, 30 can't be 0. So 30:1)\n\nNow, the isolated nodes: 6, 18, 31, 37. They can be colored with any color. Let's assign 0 to 6, 1 to 18, 2 to 31, 0 to 37.\n\nNode 6:0, 18:1, 31:2, 37:0.\n\nLet's check all nodes to make sure:\n\n0:1 (neighbors 39:0, 23:0 → okay)\n1:1 (neighbors 34:0, 3:0, 11:0, 14:0 → okay)\n2:0 (neighbors 27:2, 33:1 → okay)\n3:0 (neighbors 10:1, 1:1, 36:2 → okay)\n4:0 (neighbor 12:1 → okay)\n5:0 (neighbors 25:1, 12:1, 27:2, 32:1 → okay)\n6:0 (no neighbors → okay)\n7:0 (neighbors 19:1, 28:1 → okay)\n8:0 (neighbor 27:2 → okay)\n9:0 (neighbors 28:1, 24:1 → okay)\n10:1 (neighbors 3:0, 23:0, 35:2 → okay)\n11:0 (neighbor 1:1 → okay)\n12:1 (neighbors 4:0, 5:0 → okay)\n13:0 (neighbor 21:2 → okay)\n14:0 (neighbors 1:1, 32:1, 35:2 → okay)\n15:0 (neighbor 16:1 → okay)\n16:1 (neighbors 15:0, 22:0 → okay)\n17:0 (neighbor 30:1 → okay)\n18:1 (no neighbors → okay)\n19:1 (neighbor 7:0 → okay)\n20:1 (neighbor 34:0 → okay)\n21:2 (neighbors 23:0, 32:1, 13:0 → okay)\n22:0 (neighbors 16:1, 33:1 → okay)\n23:0 (neighbors 0:1, 24:1, 10:1, 21:2, 32:1 → okay)\n24:1 (neighbors 27:2, 38:0, 23:0, 9:0 → okay)\n25:1 (neighbors 38:0, 5:0 → okay)\n26:1 (neighbor 38:0 → okay)\n27:2 (neighbors 2:0, 24:1, 8:0, 5:0 → okay)\n28:1 (neighbors 7:0, 9:0 → okay)\n29:1 (neighbor 38:0 → okay)\n30:1 (neighbor 17:0 → okay)\n31:2 (no neighbors → okay)\n32:1 (neighbors 36:2, 21:2, 14:0, 23:0, 5:0 → okay)\n33:1 (neighbors 2:0, 22:0 → okay)\n34:0 (neighbors 1:1, 20:1 → okay)\n35:2 (neighbors 39:0, 10:1, 14:0 → okay)\n36:2 (neighbors 32:1, 3:0 → okay)\n37:0 (no neighbors → okay)\n38:0 (neighbors 25:1, 29:1, 24:1, 26:1 → okay)\n39:0 (neighbors 0:1, 35:2 → okay)\n\nLooks like all adjacent nodes have different colors.

We need to color 26 nodes with 3 colors such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. First, I should start by understanding the graph structure. Let's list all the edges and note the adjacency for each node.\n\nFirst, let's list all nodes: 0-25. Now, let's map each node's neighbors based on the edges provided:\n\nEdges:\n7-20, 4-21, 14-22, 5-25, 17-24, 9-23, 13-23, 13-20, 6-17, 4-8, 8-11, 2-4, 8-14, 4-23, 0-13, 0-19, 8-20, 10-20, 2-25, 7-15, 3-11, 17-19, 5-23, 4-25, 19-25, 11-21, 13-18.\n\nLet's build adjacency lists:\n\nNode 0: neighbors 13, 19\nNode 1: Let's check edges—none listed, so no neighbors?

Let's note that.\n\nNext, let's look for high-degree nodes as they might be critical. Let's check degrees:\n\nNode 4: neighbors 21,8,2,23,25 → degree 5\nNode 25: neighbors 5,2,4,19 → degree 4\nNode 23: neighbors 9,13,4,5 → degree 4\nNode 20: neighbors 7,13,8,10 → degree 4\nNode 8: neighbors 4,11,14,20 → degree 4\nNode 13: neighbors 23,20,0,18 → degree 4\nNode 11: neighbors 8,3,21 → degree 3\nNode 17: neighbors 24,6,19 → degree 3\nNode 19: neighbors 0,17,25 → degree 3\nNode 7: neighbors 20,15 → degree 2\nNode 2: neighbors 4,25 → degree 2\nNode 5: neighbors 25,23 → degree 2\nNode 6: neighbors 17 → degree 1\nNode 3: neighbors 11 → degree 1\nNode 9: neighbors 23 → degree 1\nNode 10: neighbors 20 → degree 1\nNode 14: neighbors 22,8 → degree 2\nNode 15: neighbors 7 → degree 1\nNode 18: neighbors 13 → degree 1\nNode 21: neighbors 4,11 → degree 2\nNode 22: neighbors 14 → degree 1\nNode 24: neighbors 17 → degree 1\nNodes 1,12,16: degree 0.\n\nSo node 4 has the highest degree (5). Let's start with node 4. Let's assign color 0 to node 4. Then its neighbors (21,8,2,23,25) must be 1 or 2.\n\nNode 21 is neighbor of 4. Let's assign 1 to 21. Then 21's neighbors are 4 (0) and 11. So 11 can't be 1. 11's neighbors are 8,3,21 (1). So 11 can be 0 or 2. Let's see node 8 is neighbor of 4 (0), so 8 can't be 0. Let's say 8 is 1. Then 11, neighbor of 8 (1), can't be 1. 11 is also neighbor of 21 (1), so 11 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 0 to 11. Then node 3, neighbor of 11 (0), can be 1 or 2. Let's say 1.\n\nNode 2 is neighbor of 4 (0), so 2 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 1. Then node 2's neighbor 25 can't be 1. 25's neighbors are 5,2 (1),4 (0),19. So 25 can be 2. Let's assign 2 to 25.\n\nNode 23 is neighbor of 4 (0), so 23 can be 1 or 2. 23's neighbors: 9,13,4 (0),5. Let's check 5. 5 is neighbor of 25 (2), so 5 can't be 2. 5 is also neighbor of 23. If 23 is 1, then 5 can be 0 (since 25 is 2). Let's assign 23 as 1. Then 5, neighbor of 23 (1) and 25 (2), can be 0. So 5:0.\n\nNode 25 is 2. Its neighbors: 5 (0), 2 (1),4 (0),19. So 19 can't be 2. 19's neighbors: 0,17,25 (2). So 19 can be 0 or 1. Let's assign 19:0. Then node 0, neighbor of 19 (0), can't be 0. 0's neighbors: 13,19 (0). So 0 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 1.\n\nNode 17 is neighbor of 19 (0), so 17 can be 1 or 2. 17's neighbors: 24,6,19 (0). 24 is neighbor of 17, 6 is neighbor of 17. Let's assign 17:1. Then 24 can be 0 or 2. 6 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 24:0, 6:2.\n\nNode 20 is neighbor of 7,13,8,10. Let's see 8 is 1, so 20 can't be 1. 20's other neighbors: 7,13,10. Let's check 8:1, so 20 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 20:0. Then 7 is neighbor of 20 (0), so 7 can be 1 or 2. 7's other neighbor is 15. Let's assign 7:1, 15:0.\n\nNode 13 is neighbor of 23 (1), 20 (0), 0 (1), 18. 13's neighbors: 23 (1), 20 (0), 0 (1). So 13 can't be 1 or 0, so 13 must be 2. Then 18, neighbor of 13 (2), can be 0 or 1. Let's assign 18:0.\n\nNode 10 is neighbor of 20 (0), so 10 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 10:1.\n\nNode 14 is neighbor of 22,8 (1). 8 is 1, so 14 can be 0 or 2. 14's other neighbor is 22. Let's assign 14:0. Then 22, neighbor of 14 (0), can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 22:1.\n\nNode 9 is neighbor of 23 (1), so 9 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 9:0.\n\nIsolated nodes (1,12,16): Let's color them 0,1,2 respectively. So 1:0, 12:1, 16:2.\n\nLet's check all nodes:\n\n0:1 (neighbors 13 (2), 19 (0) → ok)\n1:0 (no neighbors → ok)\n2:1 (neighbors 4 (0), 25 (2) → ok)\n3:1 (neighbor 11 (0) → ok)\n4:0 (neighbors 21 (1), 8 (1), 2 (1), 23 (1), 25 (2) → all different)\n5:0 (neighbors 25 (2), 23 (1) → ok)\n6:2 (neighbor 17 (1) → ok)\n7:1 (neighbors 20 (0), 15 (0) → ok)\n8:1 (neighbors 4 (0), 11 (0), 14 (0), 20 (0) → wait, 8 is 1, neighbors 4 (0), 11 (0), 14 (0), 20 (0). All different, that's ok.\n9:0 (neighbor 23 (1) → ok)\n10:1 (neighbor 20 (0) → ok)\n11:0 (neighbors 8 (1), 3 (1), 21 (1) → all different)\n12:1 (no neighbors → ok)\n13:2 (neighbors 23 (1), 20 (0), 0 (1), 18 (0) → all different)\n14:0 (neighbors 22 (1), 8 (1) → ok)\n15:0 (neighbor 7 (1) → ok)\n16:2 (no neighbors → ok)\n17:1 (neighbors 24 (0), 6 (2), 19 (0) → ok)\n18:0 (neighbor 13 (2) → ok)\n19:0 (neighbors 0 (1), 17 (1), 25 (2) → ok)\n20:0 (neighbors 7 (1), 13 (2), 8 (1), 10 (1) → ok)\n21:1 (neighbors 4 (0), 11 (0) → ok)\n22:1 (neighbor 14 (0) → ok)\n23:1 (neighbors 9 (0), 13 (2), 4 (0), 5 (0) → ok)\n24:0 (neighbor 17 (1) → ok)\n25:2 (neighbors 5 (0), 2 (1), 4 (0), 19 (0) → ok)\n\nWait, let's check node 8: color 1. Its neighbors are 4 (0), 11 (0), 14 (0), 20 (0). All different from 1. That's good.\n\nNode 23: color 1. Neighbors 9 (0), 13 (2), 4 (0), 5 (0). All different. Good.\n\nNode 20: color 0. Neighbors 7 (1), 13 (2), 8 (1), 10 (1). All different. Good.\n\nNode 19: color 0. Neighbors 0 (1), 17 (1), 25 (2). All different. Good.\n\nNode 25: color 2. Neighbors 5 (0), 2 (1), 4 (0), 19 (0).

First, I need to list all the nodes and their edges to see which are connected. The nodes are 0-15. Let's list the adjacency for each node:\n\nNode 0: connected to 5, 10 (edges 0-5, 0-10)\nNode 1: Wait, do any edges involve node 1? Let me check the edges again. The edges given are: 6-12, 8-9, 9-14, 0-5, 2-8, 2-14, 7-10, 6-8, 6-14, 4-11, 3-15, 8-11, 0-10, 12-14, 3-8, 5-11, 5-8, 2-3, 7-8. Oh, node 1 isn't in any edge. So node 1 is an isolated node. That's easy, it can take any color.\n\nNode 2: connected to 8, 14, 3 (edges 2-8, 2-14, 2-3)\nNode 3: connected to 15, 8, 2 (edges 3-15, 3-8, 2-3)\nNode 4: connected to 11 (edge 4-11)\nNode 5: connected to 0, 11, 8 (edges 0-5, 5-11, 5-8)\nNode 6: connected to 12, 8, 14 (edges 6-12, 6-8, 6-14)\nNode 7: connected to 10, 8 (edges 7-10, 7-8)\nNode 8: connected to 9, 2, 6, 11, 3, 5, 7 (edges 8-9, 2-8, 6-8, 8-11, 3-8, 5-8, 7-8). So node 8 has a lot of neighbors: 2,3,5,6,7,9,11. That's 7 neighbors. So node 8 is a high-degree node; need to color it carefully.\nNode 9: connected to 8, 14 (edges 8-9, 9-14)\nNode 10: connected to 7, 0 (edges 7-10, 0-10)\nNode 11: connected to 4, 8, 5 (edges 4-11, 8-11, 5-11)\nNode 12: connected to 6, 14 (edges 6-12, 12-14)\nNode 13: Is node 13 in any edge? Checking edges again. No, 13 isn't mentioned.

Its neighbors are 2,3,5,6,7,9,11. Let's see their connections. Let's try to build a coloring step by step.\n\nStart with node 8. Let's assign it color 0. Then its neighbors (2,3,5,6,7,9,11) must be colored with 1 or 2.\n\nNode 2 is connected to 8 (0), 14, 3. Let's color node 2 with color 1. Then node 3 (connected to 2 (1), 8 (0), 15) can't be 0 or 1, so 2. Node 3 is color 2. Then node 15 (connected to 3 (2)) can be 0 or 1. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 5 is connected to 8 (0), 0, 11. Let's color node 5. Since 8 is 0, 5 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Then node 0 (connected to 5 (1), 10) can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0. Then node 10 (connected to 0 (0), 7) can be 1 or 2. Let's hold on node 10.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 8 (0), 12, 14. Let's color node 6. 8 is 0, so 6 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Then node 12 (connected to 6 (1), 14) can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0. Node 14 is connected to 2 (1), 6 (1), 9, 12 (0). So 14's neighbors are 1,1,0. So 14 can be 2 (since 0 and 1 are used by neighbors). So 14 is 2. Then node 9 is connected to 8 (0), 14 (2). So 9 can be 1. Good.\n\nNode 7 is connected to 8 (0), 10. Let's color node 7. 8 is 0, so 7 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Then node 10 (connected to 7 (1), 0 (0)) can be 2. That works.\n\nNode 11 is connected to 8 (0), 5 (1), 4. So 11's neighbors are 0 and 1, so 11 can be 2. Then node 4 (connected to 11 (2)) can be 0 or 1. Let's say 0.\n\nNow let's check all nodes:\n\nNode 0: connected to 5 (1) and 10 (2). 0 is 0. Good.\nNode 1: isolated, color 0.\nNode 2: connected to 8 (0), 14 (2), 3 (2). 2 is 1. Good.\nNode 3: connected to 2 (1), 8 (0), 15 (0). 3 is 2. Good.\nNode 4: connected to 11 (2). 4 is 0. Good.\nNode 5: connected to 0 (0), 11 (2), 8 (0). 5 is 1. Good.\nNode 6: connected to 8 (0), 12 (0), 14 (2). 6 is 1. Good.\nNode 7: connected to 8 (0), 10 (2). 7 is 1. Good.\nNode 8: color 0. Neighbors 2 (1),3 (2),5 (1),6 (1),7 (1),9 (1),11 (2). All different from 0. Good.\nNode 9: connected to 8 (0), 14 (2). 9 is 1. Good.\nNode 10: connected to 0 (0),7 (1). 10 is 2. Good.\nNode 11: connected to 8 (0),5 (1),4 (0). 11 is 2. Good.\nNode 12: connected to 6 (1),14 (2). 12 is 0. Good.\nNode 13: isolated, color 0 (or any, but 0 is fine).\nNode 14: connected to 9 (1),2 (1),6 (1),12 (0). 14 is 2. Good.\nNode 15: connected to 3 (2). 15 is 0. Good.\n\nWait, let's check all edges:\n\n6-12: 6 is 1, 12 is 0 → ok.\n8-9: 8 is 0, 9 is 1 → ok.\n9-14: 9 is 1, 14 is 2 → ok.\n0-5: 0 is 0, 5 is 1 → ok.\n2-8: 2 is 1, 8 is 0 → ok.\n2-14: 2 is 1, 14 is 2 → ok.\n7-10: 7 is 1, 10 is 2 → ok.\n6-8: 6 is 1, 8 is 0 → ok.\n6-14: 6 is 1, 14 is 2 → ok.\n4-11: 4 is 0, 11 is 2 → ok.\n3-15: 3 is 2, 15 is 0 → ok.\n8-11: 8 is 0, 11 is 2 → ok.\n0-10: 0 is 0, 10 is 2 → ok.\n12-14: 12 is 0, 14 is 2 → ok.\n3-8: 3 is 2, 8 is 0 → ok.\n5-11: 5 is 1, 11 is 2 → ok.\n5-8: 5 is 1, 8 is 0 → ok.\n2-3: 2 is 1, 3 is 2 → ok.\n7-8: 7 is 1, 8 is 0 → ok.\n\nAll edges have different colors. So this works. The isolated nodes 1 and 13 are colored 0. Let's list all:\n\n[0,0], [1,0], [2,1], [3,2], [4,0], [5,1], [6,1], [7,1], [8,0], [9,1], [10,2], [11,2], [12,0], [13,0], [14,2], [15,0]\n\nWait, but node 13 is isolated, so color 0 is fine. Let's check if any node has a conflict. All edges are covered. Looks good.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 2], [4, 0], [5, 1], [6, 1], [7, 1], [8, 0], [9, 1], [10, 2], [11, 2], [12, 0], [13, 0], [14, 2], [15, 0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

The goal is to color all 23 nodes (0-22) with exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2) such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. First, I need to understand the structure of the graph by looking at the edges provided. Let's list out all the edges again to get a clear picture:\n\nEdges:\n3-7, 5-7, 4-21, 8-12, 11-14, 10-18, 13-14, 20-22, 14-18, 8-11, 0-1, 10-11, 10-14, 13-16, 11-22, 7-9, 6-7, 7-18, 12-14, 0-6, 1-16, 2-15\n\nLet me start by identifying connected components. Wait, are all nodes connected? Let's check. Node 0 is connected to 1 and 6. Node 1 is connected to 0 and 16. Node 6 is connected to 0 and 7. Node 7 is connected to 3,5,6,9,18. Node 18 is connected to 7,10,14. Node 10 is connected to 11,14,18. Node 11 is connected to 8,10,14,22. Node 14 is connected to 11,13,18,12. Node 12 is connected to 8,14. Node 8 is connected to 11,12. Node 13 is connected to 14,16. Node 16 is connected to 1,13. Node 22 is connected to 11,20. Node 20 is connected to 22. Node 21 is connected to 4. Node 2 is connected to 15. Node 3 is connected to 7. Node 4 is connected to 21. Node 5 is connected to 7. Node 9 is connected to 7. Node 15 is connected to 2.\n\nSo the connected components are:\n\n- Component 1: 0,1,6,7,3,5,9,18,10,11,14,12,8,13,16,22,20 (all these are connected through various edges)\n- Component 2: 2,15 (connected via 2-15)\n- Component 3: 4,21 (connected via 4-21)\n\nEach component can be colored independently. Let's handle each component.\n\nFirst, Component 3: Nodes 4 and 21 connected by an edge. So they need different colors. Let's assign 4:0, 21:1.\n\nComponent 2: Nodes 2 and 15 connected by an edge. Assign 2:0, 15:1.\n\nNow Component 1: The main big component. Let's try to find a way to color this with 3 colors. Let's list the nodes in this component: 0,1,6,7,3,5,9,18,10,11,14,12,8,13,16,22,20.\n\nLet's start with node 0. Let's pick color 0 for node 0. Then node 1 (adjacent to 0) can't be 0. Let's pick 1 for node 1. Node 6 is adjacent to 0 (color 0), so 6 can't be 0. Let's pick 1 for node 6. Now node 7 is adjacent to 6 (color 1), so 7 can't be 1. Let's pick 0 for node 7. Now node 3 is adjacent to 7 (color 0), so 3 can't be 0. Let's pick 1. Node 5 is adjacent to 7 (0), so 5 can't be 0. Let's pick 1. Node 9 is adjacent to 7 (0), so 9 can't be 0. Let's pick 1. \n\nNode 18 is adjacent to 7 (0). So 18 can't be 0. Let's see what else is connected to 18. 18 is connected to 10 and 14. Let's check 10: 10 is connected to 11, 14, 18. 11 is connected to 8, 10, 14, 22. 14 is connected to 11, 13, 18, 12. 12 is connected to 8,14. 8 is connected to 11,12. 13 is connected to 14,16. 16 is connected to 1 (color 1) and 13. 22 is connected to 11, 20. 20 is connected to 22.\n\nLet's proceed step by step. Node 18 is adjacent to 7 (0), so 18 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 18 is 1. Then node 10 is adjacent to 18 (1), so 10 can't be 1. Let's check 10's other neighbors: 11 and 14. Let's assign 10 to 0. Then node 11 is adjacent to 10 (0), so 11 can't be 0. 11 is also connected to 8 and 14 and 22. Let's assign 11 to 1. Then node 14 is adjacent to 10 (0) and 11 (1), so 14 can't be 0 or 1, so 14 must be 2. Now 14 is connected to 12, 13, 18. 18 is 1, 14 is 2, so 12 is adjacent to 14 (2). 12 is also connected to 8. Let's assign 12 to 0. Then 8 is connected to 12 (0) and 11 (1). So 8 can't be 0 or 1, so 8 must be 2. Now 8 is 2. \n\nNode 13 is adjacent to 14 (2), so 13 can't be 2. 13 is also connected to 16. 16 is connected to 1 (color 1). Let's see 16's color. 1 is 1, so 16 can't be 1. 13 is connected to 16, so 13 and 16 must differ. Let's assign 13 to 0. Then 16 (adjacent to 13 (0)) can't be 0, and 16 can't be 1 (from node 1), so 16 must be 2. \n\nNode 22 is connected to 11 (1). So 22 can't be 1. 22 is also connected to 20. Let's assign 22 to 0. Then 20 (adjacent to 22 (0)) can't be 0, so 20 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. \n\nNow let's check all nodes in component 1:\n\n- 0:0 (adjacent to 1 (1) and 6 (1) → ok)\n- 1:1 (adjacent to 0 (0) and 16 (2) → ok)\n- 6:1 (adjacent to 0 (0) and 7 (0) → ok)\n- 7:0 (adjacent to 3 (1),5 (1),6 (1),9 (1),18 (1) → ok)\n- 3:1 (adjacent to 7 (0) → ok)\n- 5:1 (adjacent to 7 (0) → ok)\n- 9:1 (adjacent to 7 (0) → ok)\n- 18:1 (adjacent to 7 (0),10 (0),14 (2) → ok)\n- 10:0 (adjacent to 11 (1),14 (2),18 (1) → ok)\n- 11:1 (adjacent to 8 (2),10 (0),14 (2),22 (0) → ok)\n- 14:2 (adjacent to 11 (1),13 (0),18 (1),12 (0) → ok)\n- 12:0 (adjacent to 8 (2),14 (2) → ok)\n- 8:2 (adjacent to 11 (1),12 (0) → ok)\n- 13:0 (adjacent to 14 (2),16 (2) → ok)\n- 16:2 (adjacent to 1 (1),13 (0) → ok)\n- 22:0 (adjacent to 11 (1),20 (1) → ok)\n- 20:1 (adjacent to 22 (0) → ok)\n\nComponent 2: nodes 2 and 15. Let's check 2-15. If 2 is 0, 15 can be 1. But 0 is already used in component 1, but colors are global. So 2:0, 15:1 is okay.\n\nComponent 3: nodes 4 and 21. 4-21. Let's assign 4:0, 21:1. But 0 and 1 are used elsewhere, but that's fine.\n\nWait, but 3 colors are 0,1,2. Let's check if we're using all 3. In component 1, we have colors 0,1,2 (e.g., 14 is 2, 8 is 2, 16 is 2). Component 2 uses 0 and 1. Component 3 uses 0 and 1. So 2 is used in component 1, so all 3 colors are used. That's good because the problem says \"exactly 3 colors\", so we need to use all three.\n\nWait, but let's confirm if all colors 0,1,2 are present. Yes, 0 is used (0,10,13,22,2), 1 is used (1,6,3,5,9,18,11,20,15,21), 2 is used (8,14,16). So all three colors are used.\n\nLet's check for any conflicts:\n\nCheck 0: adjacent to 1 (1) and 6 (1) → ok.\n\n1: adjacent to 0 (0) and 16 (2) → ok.\n\n6: adjacent to 0 (0) and 7 (0) → ok.\n\n7: adjacent to 3 (1),5 (1),6 (1),9 (1),18 (1) → ok.\n\n3: adjacent to 7 (0) → ok.\n\n5: adjacent to 7 (0) → ok.\n\n9: adjacent to 7 (0) → ok.\n\n18: adjacent to 7 (0),10 (0),14 (2) → ok.\n\n10: adjacent to 11 (1),14 (2),18 (1) → ok.\n\n11: adjacent to 8 (2),10 (0),14 (2),22 (0) → ok.\n\n14: adjacent to 11 (1),13 (0),18 (1),12 (0) → ok.\n\n12: adjacent to 8 (2),14 (2) → ok.\n\n8: adjacent to 11 (1),12 (0) → ok.\n\n13: adjacent to 14 (2),16 (2) → ok.\n\n16: adjacent to 1 (1),13 (0) → ok.\n\n22: adjacent to 11 (1),20 (1) → ok.\n\n20: adjacent to 22 (0) → ok.\n\nComponent 2: 2 (0) adjacent to 15 (1) → ok.\n\nComponent 3: 4 (0) adjacent to 21 (1) → ok.\n\nWait, but node 2 is in component 2, connected to 15. 2 is 0, 15 is 1 → ok.\n\nNode 4 is 0, 21 is 1 → ok.\n\nIs there any node that's not colored? Let's list all nodes 0-22:\n\n0:0, 1:1, 2:0, 3:1, 4:0, 5:1, 6:1, 7:0, 8:2, 9:1, 10:0, 11:1, 12:0, 13:0, 14:2, 15:1, 16:2, 17: ??? Oh wait, node 17 is not mentioned in the edges. So node 17 is an isolated node (no edges). So we need to color it with one of the 3 colors. Let's assign 17 to 2 (since 2 is already used, and we need to use all 3 colors. But 17 is isolated, so any color is fine. Let's pick 2.\n\nAh! I missed node 17. The nodes are 0-22, so 23 nodes. The edges given don't include 17, so 17 is an isolated node. So we need to color it. Let's assign 17:2.\n\nNow check all nodes:\n\n0:0, 1:1, 2:0, 3:1, 4:0, 5:1, 6:1, 7:0, 8:2, 9:1, 10:0, 11:1, 12:0, 13:0, 14:2, 15:1, 16:2, 17:2, 18:1, 19: ??? Oh wait, node 19 is also not mentioned in the edges. Oh no, the nodes are 0-22, which is 23 nodes. Let's check the original problem statement: Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. So 0-22, 23 nodes. The edges provided don't include 17, 19. So 17 and 19 are isolated nodes.\n\nSo I missed 17 and 19. Let's correct that.\n\nIsolated nodes can be colored with any color, but since we need to use exactly 3 colors, we need to make sure all three are used. Let's check current colors: 0,1,2 are already used (0 in 0,10, etc.; 1 in 1,6, etc.; 2 in 8,14, etc.). So 17 and 19 can be colored with any of the colors. Let's assign 17:2 (already used) and 19:0 (already used). That's fine.\n\nSo adding:\n\n17:2, 19:0.\n\nNow let's list all nodes:\n\n0:0, 1:1, 2:0, 3:1, 4:0, 5:1, 6:1, 7:0, 8:2, 9:1, 10:0, 11:1, 12:0, 13:0, 14:2, 15:1, 16:2, 17:2, 18:1, 19:0, 20:1, 21:1, 22:0.\n\nWait, wait. Let's recheck node 21. Earlier, I assigned 4:0 and 21:1. That's correct (4-21 edge). So 21 is 1.\n\nNode 20 is connected to 22 (0), so 20 can be 1 (since 22 is 0). Correct.\n\nNode 19 is isolated, so 19 can be 0.\n\nNow let's check all nodes:\n\n0:0 (adj 1:1, 6:1) → ok.\n\n1:1 (adj 0:0, 16:2) → ok.\n\n2:0 (adj 15:1) → ok.\n\n3:1 (adj 7:0) → ok.\n\n4:0 (adj 21:1) → ok.\n\n5:1 (adj 7:0) → ok.\n\n6:1 (adj 0:0, 7:0) → ok.\n\n7:0 (adj 3:1,5:1,6:1,9:1,18:1) → ok.\n\n8:2 (adj 11:1, 12:0) → ok.\n\n9:1 (adj 7:0) → ok.\n\n10:0 (adj 11:1,14:2,18:1) → ok.\n\n11:1 (adj 8:2,10:0,14:2,22:0) → ok.\n\n12:0 (adj 8:2,14:2) → ok.\n\n13:0 (adj 14:2,16:2) → ok.\n\n14:2 (adj 11:1,13:0,18:1,12:0) → ok.\n\n15:1 (adj 2:0) → ok.\n\n16:2 (adj 1:1,13:0) → ok.\n\n17:2 (no adj) → ok.\n\n18:1 (adj 7:0,10:0,14:2) → ok.\n\n19:0 (no adj) → ok.\n\n20:1 (adj 22:0) → ok.\n\n21:1 (adj 4:0) → ok.\n\n22:0 (adj 11:1,20:1) → ok.\n\nYes, all adjacent nodes have different colors, and all 3 colors are used (0,1,2).

First, I need to list all the nodes and their connections. The nodes are 0-32, so 33 nodes. The edges are given, so I need to make sure that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.\n\nFirst, let's list all the edges to see which nodes are connected. Let's start by building an adjacency list. Let's go through each edge:\n\n16 - 26\n1 - 31\n5 - 7\n20 - 29\n23 - 25\n0 - 5\n9 - 14\n5 - 22\n19 - 21\n1 - 9\n27 - 31\n10 - 30\n15 - 23\n6 - 20\n0 - 18\n20 - 25\n4 - 14\n14 - 18\n14 - 15\n4 - 29\n9 - 19\n19 - 23\n1 - 14\n30 - 32\n9 - 31\n0 - 28\n0 - 31\n18 - 30\n7 - 30\n14 - 26\n0 - 15\n5 - 29\n2 - 18\n1 - 16\n11 - 18\n\nSo, for each node, let's note its neighbors. Let's start with node 0:\n\nNode 0's neighbors: 5, 18, 28, 31, 15 (from edges 0-5, 0-18, 0-28, 0-31, 0-15)\n\nNode 1's neighbors: 31, 9, 14, 16 (edges 1-31, 1-9, 1-14, 1-16)\n\nNode 2's neighbors: 18 (edge 2-18)\n\nNode 3: Let's check if node 3 is in any edges. Looking through the list, no edges mention node 3. So node 3 is isolated.\n\nNode 4's neighbors: 14, 29 (edges 4-14, 4-29)\n\nNode 5's neighbors: 7, 0, 22, 29 (edges 5-7, 0-5, 5-22, 5-29)\n\nNode 6's neighbors: 20 (edge 6-20)\n\nNode 7's neighbors: 5, 30 (edges 5-7, 7-30)\n\nNode 8: Not in any edges, isolated.\n\nNode 9's neighbors: 14, 1, 19, 31 (edges 9-14, 1-9, 9-19, 9-31)\n\nNode 10's neighbors: 30 (edge 10-30)\n\nNode 11's neighbors: 18 (edge 11-18)\n\nNode 12: Isolated.\n\nNode 13: Isolated.\n\nNode 14's neighbors: 9, 4, 18, 15, 26, 1 (edges 9-14, 4-14, 14-18, 14-15, 14-26, 1-14)\n\nNode 15's neighbors: 23, 14, 0 (edges 15-23, 14-15, 0-15)\n\nNode 16's neighbors: 26, 1 (edges 16-26, 1-16)\n\nNode 17: Isolated.\n\nNode 18's neighbors: 0, 14, 30, 2, 11 (edges 0-18, 14-18, 18-30, 2-18, 11-18)\n\nNode 19's neighbors: 21, 9, 23 (edges 19-21, 9-19, 19-23)\n\nNode 20's neighbors: 29, 6, 25 (edges 20-29, 6-20, 20-25)\n\nNode 21's neighbors: 19 (edge 19-21)\n\nNode 22's neighbors: 5 (edge 5-22)\n\nNode 23's neighbors: 25, 15, 19 (edges 23-25, 15-23, 19-23)\n\nNode 24: Isolated.\n\nNode 25's neighbors: 23, 20 (edges 23-25, 20-25)\n\nNode 26's neighbors: 16, 14 (edges 16-26, 14-26)\n\nNode 27's neighbors: 31 (edge 27-31)\n\nNode 28's neighbors: 0 (edge 0-28)\n\nNode 29's neighbors: 20, 4, 5 (edges 20-29, 4-29, 5-29)\n\nNode 30's neighbors: 10, 32, 18, 7 (edges 10-30, 30-32, 18-30, 7-30)\n\nNode 31's neighbors: 1, 27, 9, 0 (edges 1-31, 27-31, 9-31, 0-31)\n\nNode 32's neighbors: 30 (edge 30-32)\n\nSo, the isolated nodes are 3, 8, 12, 13, 17, 24. They can be colored with any color, since they have no neighbors. Let's note that.\n\nNow, let's look for nodes with high degrees. For example, node 14 is connected to 9,4,18,15,26,1. That's 6 neighbors. Node 0 is connected to 5,18,28,31,15 (5 neighbors). Node 18 is connected to 0,14,30,2,11 (5 neighbors). Node 30 is connected to 10,32,18,7 (4 neighbors). Node 9 is connected to 14,1,19,31 (4 neighbors). Node 15 is connected to 23,14,0 (3). Node 23 is connected to 25,15,19 (3). Node 5 is connected to 7,0,22,29 (4). Node 20 is connected to 29,6,25 (3). Node 25 is connected to 23,20 (2). Node 26 is connected to 16,14 (2). Node 1 is connected to 31,9,14,16 (4). Node 31 is connected to 1,27,9,0 (4). \n\nLet's start with node 0. Let's assign color 0. Then its neighbors (5,18,28,31,15) can't be 0. Let's see node 5: neighbors are 7,0,22,29. Since 0 is color 0, 5 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1 for node 5. Then node 7 (connected to 5) can't be 1. Node 7 is also connected to 30, so 7's color can't be same as 30's. Node 22 (connected to 5) can't be 1, so 22 can be 0 or 2. Node 29 (connected to 5) can't be 1, so 29 can be 0 or 2.\n\nNode 18 is a neighbor of 0 (color 0), so 18 can be 1 or 2. Let's see node 18's other neighbors: 14,30,2,11. Let's check node 14: node 14 is connected to 9,4,18,15,26,1. If 18 is 1, then 14 can't be 1. Let's tentatively assign 18 color 1. Then 14 can't be 1. Let's check node 14's other neighbors: 9,4,15,26,1. Let's say 14 is 0. Then 9 (connected to 14) can't be 0. 4 (connected to 14) can't be 0. 15 (connected to 14) can't be 0. 26 (connected to 14) can't be 0. 1 (connected to 14) can't be 0.\n\nNode 15 is a neighbor of 0 (color 0) and 14 (color 0). So 15 can't be 0, so 15 must be 1 or 2. Let's say 15 is 1. Then 23 (connected to 15) can't be 1. 23's neighbors: 25,15,19. 15 is 1, so 23 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 23 is 0. Then 25 (connected to 23) can't be 0. 25 is also connected to 20, so 25's color can't be same as 20's. 20 is connected to 29,6,25. 29 is connected to 20,4,5. 5 is 1, so 29 can't be 1. Let's see 29: 5 is 1, 4 is connected to 14 (0), so 4 can't be 0, so 4 is 1 or 2. Let's say 4 is 1. Then 29 (connected to 4) can't be 1, so 29 is 2. Then 20 (connected to 29) can't be 2. 20 is also connected to 6 and 25. Let's say 20 is 0. Then 25 (connected to 20) can't be 0, so 25 is 1 or 2. 23 is 0, so 25 can't be 0. Let's say 25 is 1. Then 23 is 0, 25 is 1: okay. 20 is 0, 25 is 1: okay.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 20 (0), so 6 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 6 is 1.\n\nNode 19 is connected to 21,9,23 (23 is 0). So 19 can't be 0. 9 is connected to 14 (0), 1, 19, 31. Let's see 9: 14 is 0, so 9 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 9 is 1. Then 19 (connected to 9) can't be 1, so 19 is 2. 19 is connected to 23 (0), so 2 is okay. 21 (connected to 19) can't be 2, so 21 can be 0 or 1. Let's say 21 is 0.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 31,9,14,16. 14 is 0, 9 is 1. So 1 can't be 0 or 1, so 1 must be 2. Let's check: 1's neighbors: 31 (can't be 2), 9 (1) is okay, 14 (0) is okay, 16 (can't be 2). So 1 is 2.\n\nNode 16 is connected to 26 and 1 (2). So 16 can't be 2. 26 is connected to 14 (0) and 16. So 26 can't be 0. 16 can be 0 or 1. Let's say 16 is 0. Then 26 (connected to 16) can't be 0, and 26 is connected to 14 (0), so 26 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 26 is 1.\n\nNode 31 is connected to 1 (2), 27, 9 (1), 0 (0). So 31 can't be 0,1,2? Wait, 0 is 0, 9 is 1, 1 is 2. So 31's neighbors are 0 (0), 9 (1), 1 (2). So 31 has neighbors with all three colors? That's a problem. Because 31 is connected to 0 (0), 9 (1), 1 (2). So 31 can't be 0,1,2. But we only have 3 colors. That means I made a mistake here.\n\nLet's backtrack. Node 1 was assigned 2. Node 31 is connected to 1 (2), 9 (1), 0 (0). So 31 can't be 0,1,2. That's impossible. So I need to adjust the color of node 1. Let's change node 1's color. Let's see: node 1 is connected to 31,9,14,16. 14 is 0, 9 is 1. So 1 can't be 0 or 1. So 1 must be 2, but that causes 31 to have all three colors. So perhaps 9's color is wrong. Let's try changing 9's color. Let's say 9 is 2 instead of 1. Then node 1's neighbors: 14 (0), 9 (2). So 1 can be 1. Let's try that.\n\nRevising: 9 is 2. Then 1 (connected to 9 (2) and 14 (0)) can be 1. So 1 is 1. Then 31 is connected to 1 (1), 9 (2), 0 (0). So 31 can be 0,1,2? Wait, 0 is 0, 9 is 2, 1 is 1. So 31's neighbors have 0,1,2. Oh, same problem. So 31 is connected to 0 (0), 1 (1), 9 (2). So 31 can't be 0,1,2. So that's a problem. So maybe 0's color is causing this. Let's try changing 0's color. Let's say 0 is 1 instead of 0.\n\nLet's restart with 0 as 1. Then 0's neighbors (5,18,28,31,15) can't be 1.\n\nNode 5: can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 18: can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 28: can be 0 or 2 (since 0 is 1). Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 31: can be 0 or 2 (since 0 is 1). Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 15: can be 0 or 2 (since 0 is 1). Let's pick 0.\n\nNow, node 14 is connected to 9,4,18,15,26,1. 18 is 0, 15 is 0, so 14 can't be 0. So 14 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 14 (1), 1, 19, 31 (0). So 9 can't be 1 or 0. So 9 must be 2.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 31 (0), 9 (2), 14 (1), 16. So 1's neighbors are 0,2,1. So 1 can be 0,1,2? No, 1 can't be 0 (31 is 0), 1 (14 is 1), 2 (9 is 2). So 1 has neighbors with all three colors. That's a problem again. So 1 is connected to 31 (0), 9 (2), 14 (1), so 1 can't be 0,1,2. So that's not working.\n\nHmm, maybe 0's color is 2. Let's try 0 as 2. Then neighbors (5,18,28,31,15) can't be 2.\n\nNode 5: 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 18: 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 28: 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 31: 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 15: 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 14 is connected to 9,4,18 (0), 15 (0), 26, 1. So 14 can't be 0. So 14 is 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 14 (1), 1, 19, 31 (0). So 9 can't be 1 or 0. So 9 is 2.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 31 (0), 9 (2), 14 (1), 16. So 1's neighbors are 0,2,1. Again, 1 can't be any color. So that's a problem. So the issue is node 1 is connected to 31, 9, 14, which are 0, 2, 1. So 1 is in a clique of 4 nodes? Wait, are 1, 9, 14, 31 all connected to each other?\n\nCheck edges: 1-9, 1-14, 1-31; 9-14, 9-31; 14-31? Is 14 connected to 31? Let's check the edges. The edges given: 1-31, 1-9, 1-14, 9-14, 9-31. 14-31: Is there an edge? Let's check the list. The edges are: 16-26, 1-31, 5-7, 20-29, 23-25, 0-5, 9-14, 5-22, 19-21, 1-9, 27-31, 10-30, 15-23, 6-20, 0-18, 20-25, 4-14, 14-18, 14-15, 4-29, 9-19, 19-23, 1-14, 30-32, 9-31, 0-28, 0-31, 18-30, 7-30, 14-26, 0-15, 5-29, 2-18, 1-16, 11-18.\n\nAh, 1-14 is an edge, 9-14 is an edge, 9-31 is an edge, 1-31 is an edge, but 14-31 is not an edge. So 14 is not connected to 31. So 1 is connected to 9, 14, 31. 9 is connected to 14, 31. 14 is connected to 9 and 1, but not 31. 31 is connected to 1, 9, but not 14. So 1,9,31 form a triangle (1-9, 9-31, 1-31), and 14 is connected to 1 and 9, but not 31. So 1,9,31 are a triangle (3-clique), which requires 3 different colors. So 1,9,31 must each have distinct colors. That's a key point.\n\nSo 1-9, 9-31, 1-31: triangle. So 1,9,31 need 3 different colors (0,1,2). Let's assign 1:0, 9:1, 31:2. That's a valid 3-coloring for the triangle.\n\nNow, 14 is connected to 1 (0) and 9 (1). So 14 can be 2 (since 0 and 1 are taken by neighbors).\n\n14 is also connected to 4, 18, 15, 26. So 14 is 2.\n\nNow, 4 is connected to 14 (2), so 4 can be 0 or 1.\n\n18 is connected to 14 (2) and 0. Let's see node 0's connections. 0 is connected to 5,18,28,31 (2), 15. 0's neighbors include 31 (2), so 0 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0:0. Then 18 is connected to 0 (0) and 14 (2), so 18 can be 1.\n\n18 is also connected to 2, 11, 30. So 18 is 1. 2 is connected to 18 (1), so 2 can be 0 or 2. 11 is connected to 18 (1), so 11 can be 0 or 2. 30 is connected to 18 (1), 7, 10, 32.\n\n15 is connected to 14 (2) and 0 (0), so 15 can be 1. 15 is also connected to 23.\n\n23 is connected to 15 (1) and 19. 19 is connected to 9 (1) and 23. 9 is 1, so 19 can't be 1. 19 is also connected to 21.\n\nLet's proceed step by step:\n\n1:0, 9:1, 31:2 (triangle).\n\n14 connected to 1 (0) and 9 (1): 14:2.\n\n0: let's pick 0 (since 0 is connected to 31 (2), so 0 can be 0 or 1. Let's choose 0:0).\n\n0's neighbors: 5,18,28,31 (2), 15.\n\n5 is connected to 0 (0), 7, 22, 29. 5 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 5:1.\n\n18 is connected to 0 (0) and 14 (2): 18 can be 1. So 18:1.\n\n28 is connected to 0 (0): 28 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 28:1.\n\n15 is connected to 0 (0) and 14 (2): 15 can be 1. So 15:1.\n\n15 is connected to 23: 23 can't be 1. 23 is also connected to 19 and 25.\n\n19 is connected to 9 (1): 19 can't be 1. 19 is also connected to 21 and 23. Let's pick 19:0 (since 9 is 1, 19 can be 0 or 2). 19:0.\n\n23 is connected to 15 (1) and 19 (0): 23 can be 2. 23:2.\n\n25 is connected to 23 (2): 25 can be 0 or 1. 25 is also connected to 20.\n\n20 is connected to 29 and 6, 25. 20's neighbors: 29, 6, 25. Let's see 29: 29 is connected to 20, 4, 5 (1). 5 is 1, so 29 can't be 1. 4 is connected to 14 (2), so 4 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 4:0. Then 29 is connected to 4 (0), so 29 can't be 0. 29 is also connected to 5 (1), so 29 can't be 1. So 29 must be 2. 29:2.\n\n20 is connected to 29 (2), so 20 can be 0 or 1. 20 is also connected to 6 and 25. Let's pick 20:0. Then 25 (connected to 20 (0)) can be 1 or 2. 25 is connected to 23 (2), so 25 can't be 2. So 25:1.\n\n6 is connected to 20 (0): 6 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 6:1.\n\n21 is connected to 19 (0): 21 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 21:1.\n\n22 is connected to 5 (1): 22 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 22:0.\n\n7 is connected to 5 (1) and 30. 7 can be 0 or 2. 30 is connected to 18 (1), 7, 10, 32. Let's pick 7:0. Then 30 is connected to 7 (0) and 18 (1): 30 can be 2. 30:2.\n\n10 is connected to 30 (2): 10 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 10:0.\n\n32 is connected to 30 (2): 32 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 32:0.\n\n2 is connected to 18 (1): 2 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 2:0.\n\n11 is connected to 18 (1): 11 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 11:0.\n\n16 is connected to 1 (0) and 26. 1 is 0, so 16 can be 1 or 2. 26 is connected to 14 (2) and 16. 14 is 2, so 26 can't be 2. So 26 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 16:1. Then 26 is connected to 16 (1) and 14 (2), so 26 can be 0. 26:0.\n\n27 is connected to 31 (2): 27 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 27:0.\n\nNow, check isolated nodes (3,8,12,13,17,24). They can be colored with any color. Let's color them 0.\n\nLet's verify all nodes:\n\n0:0 (neighbors 5:1, 18:1, 28:1, 31:2, 15:1) → okay.\n\n1:0 (neighbors 31:2, 9:1, 14:2, 16:1) → okay.\n\n2:0 (neighbor 18:1) → okay.\n\n3:0 (no neighbors) → okay.\n\n4:0 (neighbors 14:2, 29:2) → okay.\n\n5:1 (neighbors 7:0, 0:0, 22:0, 29:2) → okay.\n\n6:1 (neighbor 20:0) → okay.\n\n7:0 (neighbors 5:1, 30:2) → okay.\n\n8:0 (no neighbors) → okay.\n\n9:1 (neighbors 14:2, 1:0, 19:0, 31:2) → okay.\n\n10:0 (neighbor 30:2) → okay.\n\n11:0 (neighbor 18:1) → okay.\n\n12:0 (no neighbors) → okay.\n\n13:0 (no neighbors) → okay.\n\n14:2 (neighbors 9:1, 4:0, 18:1, 15:1, 26:0, 1:0) → okay.\n\n15:1 (neighbors 23:2, 14:2, 0:0) → okay.\n\n16:1 (neighbors 26:0, 1:0) → okay.\n\n17:0 (no neighbors) → okay.\n\n18:1 (neighbors 0:0, 14:2, 30:2, 2:0, 11:0) → okay.\n\n19:0 (neighbors 21:1, 9:1, 23:2) → okay.\n\n20:0 (neighbors 29:2, 6:1, 25:1) → okay.\n\n21:1 (neighbor 19:0) → okay.\n\n22:0 (neighbor 5:1) → okay.\n\n23:2 (neighbors 25:1, 15:1, 19:0) → okay.\n\n24:0 (no neighbors) → okay.\n\n25:1 (neighbors 23:2, 20:0) → okay.\n\n26:0 (neighbors 16:1, 14:2) → okay.\n\n27:0 (neighbor 31:2) → okay.\n\n28:1 (neighbor 0:0) → okay.\n\n29:2 (neighbors 20:0, 4:0, 5:1) → okay.\n\n30:2 (neighbors 10:0, 32:0, 18:1, 7:0) → okay.\n\n31:2 (neighbors 1:0, 27:0, 9:1, 0:0) → okay.\n\n32:0 (neighbor 30:2) → okay.\n\nAll adjacent nodes have different colors.

The goal is to color all 43 nodes (0-42) with exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2) such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. First, I need to understand the structure of the graph by looking at the edges provided. Let's list out the edges again to see which nodes are connected:\n\nEdges:\n7-17, 15-33, 16-32, 12-19, 6-36, 21-34, 3-22, 8-12, 23-37, 17-30, 9-26, 3-40, 10-21, 1-15, 24-26, 19-42, 1-27, 13-35, 35-38, 38-40, 20-22, 4-17, 7-40, 20-40, 3-30, 23-36, 34-42, 19-23, 30-32, 9-34, 0-25, 7-15, 1-29, 12-17, 4-19, 3-23, 21-32, 34-35, 8-16, 3-35, 5-26, 0-21, 17-37, 11-18, 8-25\n\nFirst, I need to find the adjacency list for each node. Let's start by building that.\n\nNode 0: connected to 25, 21 (from 0-25, 0-21)\nNode 1: connected to 15, 27, 29 (1-15, 1-27, 1-29)\nNode 2: No edges listed? Let's check all edges. The edges given don't mention node 2. So node 2 is isolated.\nNode 3: connected to 22, 40, 30, 23, 35 (3-22, 3-40, 3-30, 3-23, 3-35)\nNode 4: connected to 17, 19 (4-17, 4-19)\nNode 5: connected to 26 (5-26)\nNode 6: connected to 36 (6-36)\nNode 7: connected to 17, 40, 15 (7-17, 7-40, 7-15)\nNode 8: connected to 12, 16, 25 (8-12, 8-16, 8-25)\nNode 9: connected to 26, 34 (9-26, 9-34)\nNode 10: connected to 21 (10-21)\nNode 11: connected to 18 (11-18)\nNode 12: connected to 19, 8, 17 (12-19, 8-12, 12-17)\nNode 13: connected to 35 (13-35)\nNode 14: No edges mentioned.

Isolated.\nNode 29: connected to 1 (1-29)\nNode 30: connected to 17, 32, 3 (17-30, 30-32, 3-30)\nNode 31: No edges mentioned. Isolated.\nNode 32: connected to 16, 21, 30 (16-32, 21-32, 30-32)\nNode 33: connected to 15 (15-33)\nNode 34: connected to 21, 42, 9, 35 (21-34, 34-42, 9-34, 34-35)\nNode 35: connected to 13, 38, 34, 3 (13-35, 35-38, 34-35, 3-35)\nNode 36: connected to 6, 23 (6-36, 23-36)\nNode 37: connected to 23, 17 (23-37, 17-37)\nNode 38: connected to 35, 40 (35-38, 38-40)\nNode 39: No edges mentioned.

Isolated.\nNode 42: connected to 19, 34 (19-42, 34-42)\n\nNow, let's note the isolated nodes: 2, 14, 28, 31, 39, 41. These can be colored with any color, but since we need exactly 3 colors, we can assign them colors 0, 1, 2 in some order to ensure all 3 are used.\n\nNext, let's look for nodes with high degrees. Node 3 is connected to 22, 40, 30, 23, 35 (degree 5). Node 7 is connected to 17, 40, 15 (degree 3). Node 17 is connected to 7, 30, 4, 12, 37 (degree 5). Node 19 has degree 4, node 23 degree 4, node 34 degree 4, node 40 degree 4, node 35 degree 4, node 21 degree 4, node 32 degree 3, etc.\n\nLet's start with node 3. Let's assign color 0 to node 3. Then its neighbors (22, 40, 30, 23, 35) can't be 0.\n\nNode 22 is connected to 3 and 20. Let's assign color 1 to 22. Then node 20 (connected to 22 and 40) can't be 1. 40 is connected to 3 (0), 7, 20, 38. Let's see node 40: if 3 is 0, 40 can't be 0. 20 is connected to 22 (1) and 40, so 20 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 20 is 2, then 40 can't be 2 (since 20 is 2), so 40 must be 1.\n\nNode 40 is 1. Then 38 (connected to 40 and 35) can't be 1. 35 is connected to 3 (0), 38, 34, 13. 35 can't be 0. Let's say 35 is 1. Then 38 can't be 1 (from 35) or 1 (from 40), so 38 must be 0.\n\nNode 38 is 0. 35 is 1 (connected to 38 (0), which is okay). 34 is connected to 35 (1), 21, 42, 9. Let's assign 34: can't be 1 (from 35). Let's say 34 is 0. Then 21 (connected to 34 (0)) can be 1 or 2. 21 is also connected to 10, 32, 0. Let's assign 21 color 1.\n\nNode 21 is 1. 10 (connected to 21) can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 10 color 0. 32 is connected to 21 (1), 16, 30. 30 is connected to 3 (0), 17, 32. 30 can't be 0 (from 3). Let's say 30 is 1. Then 32 (connected to 30 (1)) can't be 1. 32 is connected to 16 and 21 (1), so 32 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 32 is 0. Then 16 (connected to 32 (0)) can be 1 or 2. 16 is also connected to 8. Let's keep 16 for later.\n\nNode 17 is connected to 7, 30 (1), 4, 12, 37. 30 is 1, so 17 can't be 1. Let's say 17 is 0. Then 7 (connected to 17 (0)) can be 1 or 2. 7 is also connected to 40 (1), so 7 can't be 1 (since 40 is 1), so 7 must be 2.\n\nNode 7 is 2. 15 (connected to 7 (2) and 1, 33) can be 0 or 1. Let's say 15 is 0. Then 1 (connected to 15 (0), 27, 29) can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 1 color 1.\n\nNode 1 is 1. 27 (connected to 1 (1)) can be 0 or 2. Assign 27 color 0. 29 (connected to 1 (1)) can be 0 or 2. Assign 29 color 2.\n\nNode 15 is 0. 33 (connected to 15 (0)) can be 1 or 2. Assign 33 color 1.\n\nNode 17 is 0. 4 (connected to 17 (0)) can be 1 or 2. Let's say 4 is 1. 19 is connected to 4 (1), 12, 42, 23. 12 is connected to 19, 8, 17 (0). 12 can't be 0 (from 17). Let's say 12 is 1. Then 19 (connected to 12 (1)) can't be 1. 19 is connected to 4 (1), so 19 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 19 color 2.\n\nNode 19 is 2. 42 (connected to 19 (2)) can be 0 or 1. 42 is also connected to 34 (0), so 42 can't be 0 (from 34), so 42 must be 1.\n\nNode 42 is 1. 34 is 0 (connected to 42 (1)), which is okay. 23 is connected to 19 (2), 3 (0), 36, 37. 23 can't be 0 (from 3) or 2 (from 19), so 23 must be 1.\n\nNode 23 is 1. 36 is connected to 23 (1) and 6. 36 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 36 color 0. 6 (connected to 36 (0)) can be 1 or 2. Assign 6 color 1.\n\nNode 23 is 1. 37 is connected to 23 (1) and 17 (0). 37 can be 2. Assign 37 color 2.\n\nNode 12 is 1. 8 is connected to 12 (1), 16, 25. 8 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 8 is 0. Then 16 (connected to 8 (0)) can be 1 or 2. 16 is also connected to 32 (0), so 16 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 16 color 1. Then 32 (0) is okay. 25 is connected to 8 (0) and 0. 25 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 25 color 1. Then 0 (connected to 25 (1)) can be 0 or 2. 0 is also connected to 21 (1), so 0 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 0 color 2.\n\nNode 0 is 2. 21 is 1 (connected to 0 (2)), which is okay. 25 is 1 (connected to 0 (2)), okay. 8 is 0 (connected to 25 (1)), okay.\n\nNode 21 is 1. 10 is 0 (connected to 21 (1)), okay. 32 is 0 (connected to 21 (1)), okay.\n\nNode 16 is 1. 32 is 0 (connected to 16 (1)), okay. 8 is 0 (connected to 16 (1)), okay.\n\nNode 22 is 1 (connected to 3 (0)), okay. 20 is 2 (connected to 22 (1)), okay. 40 is 1 (connected to 20 (2)), okay. 3 (0) connected to 40 (1), okay. 38 is 0 (connected to 40 (1)), okay. 35 is 1 (connected to 38 (0)), okay. 3 (0) connected to 35 (1), okay. 13 (connected to 35 (1)) can be 0 or 2. Assign 13 color 0.\n\nNode 26 is connected to 9, 24, 5. Let's check 9: connected to 26 and 34 (0). 9 can't be 0. Let's assign 9 color 1. Then 26 (connected to 9 (1)) can be 0 or 2. 24 (connected to 26) can be 0 or 2 if 26 is 1, but 26 is 0 or 2. Let's say 26 is 0. Then 24 (connected to 26 (0)) can be 1 or 2. Assign 24 color 1. 5 (connected to 26 (0)) can be 1 or 2. Assign 5 color 1.\n\nNode 11 and 18 are connected. Let's assign 11 color 0, 18 color 1.\n\nIsolated nodes (2,14,28,31,39,41) need to use all 3 colors. Let's assign 2:0, 14:1, 28:2, 31:0, 39:1, 41:2. Wait, but we need to make sure all 3 colors are used. Since the graph has connected components, but the isolated nodes can be colored with any, but we need exactly 3 colors in total. Since the connected components are colored with 0,1,2, the isolated nodes can be colored with any, but let's check if all colors are already used. Let's see:\n\nUsed colors so far: 0,1,2 (from node 3:0, 22:1, 20:2, etc.). So the isolated nodes can be colored with any, but let's just assign them 0,1,2 as needed.\n\nLet's list all nodes and their colors step by step:\n\n0: 2 (connected to 25 (1), 21 (1)) → okay\n1: 1 (connected to 15 (0), 27 (0), 29 (2)) → okay\n2: 0 (isolated)\n3: 0 (connected to 22 (1), 40 (1), 30 (1), 23 (1), 35 (1)) → okay\n4: 1 (connected to 17 (0)) → okay\n5: 1 (connected to 26 (0)) → okay\n6: 1 (connected to 36 (0)) → okay\n7: 2 (connected to 17 (0), 40 (1), 15 (0)) → okay\n8: 0 (connected to 12 (1), 16 (1), 25 (1)) → okay\n9: 1 (connected to 26 (0), 34 (0)) → okay\n10: 0 (connected to 21 (1)) → okay\n11: 0 (connected to 18 (1)) → okay\n12: 1 (connected to 19 (2), 8 (0), 17 (0)) → okay\n13: 0 (connected to 35 (1)) → okay\n14: 1 (isolated)\n15: 0 (connected to 33 (1), 1 (1), 7 (2)) → okay\n16: 1 (connected to 32 (0), 8 (0)) → okay\n17: 0 (connected to 7 (2), 30 (1), 4 (1), 12 (1), 37 (2)) → okay\n18: 1 (connected to 11 (0)) → okay\n19: 2 (connected to 12 (1), 42 (1), 4 (1), 23 (1)) → okay\n20: 2 (connected to 22 (1), 40 (1)) → okay\n21: 1 (connected to 34 (0), 10 (0), 32 (0), 0 (2)) → okay\n22: 1 (connected to 3 (0), 20 (2)) → okay\n23: 1 (connected to 37 (2), 36 (0), 19 (2), 3 (0)) → okay\n24: 1 (connected to 26 (0)) → okay\n25: 1 (connected to 0 (2), 8 (0)) → okay\n26: 0 (connected to 9 (1), 24 (1), 5 (1)) → okay\n27: 0 (connected to 1 (1)) → okay\n28: 2 (isolated)\n29: 2 (connected to 1 (1)) → okay\n30: 1 (connected to 17 (0), 32 (0), 3 (0)) → okay\n31: 0 (isolated)\n32: 0 (connected to 16 (1), 21 (1), 30 (1)) → okay\n33: 1 (connected to 15 (0)) → okay\n34: 0 (connected to 21 (1), 42 (1), 9 (1), 35 (1)) → okay\n35: 1 (connected to 13 (0), 38 (0), 34 (0), 3 (0)) → okay\n36: 0 (connected to 6 (1), 23 (1)) → okay\n37: 2 (connected to 23 (1), 17 (0)) → okay\n38: 0 (connected to 35 (1), 40 (1)) → okay\n39: 1 (isolated)\n40: 1 (connected to 3 (0), 7 (2), 20 (2), 38 (0)) → okay\n41: 2 (isolated)\n42: 1 (connected to 19 (2), 34 (0)) → okay\n\nLet's check a few critical nodes:\n\n- Node 3 (0) neighbors: 22 (1), 40 (1), 30 (1), 23 (1), 35 (1) → all different from 0.

Good.\n- Node 26 (0) neighbors: 9 (1), 24 (1), 5 (1) → different from 0. Good.\n- Isolated nodes (2,14,28,31,39,41) have colors 0,1,2,0,1,2. All 3 colors are used.\n\nLooks like all adjacent nodes have different colors, and all 3 colors are used.

First, I need to check if the graph is bipartite because a graph can be 2-colored if and only if it's bipartite (no odd-length cycles). Let's start by building the adjacency list to see the connections better.\n\nNodes are 0-20. Let's list all edges:\n\n6-15, 3-10, 5-7, 5-16, 8-9, 6-8, 15-20, 5-15, 8-14, 0-10, 9-19, 10-14, 6-7, 7-12, 6-16, 16-18, 12-17, 3-17, 9-15, 11-18.\n\nLet me list each node's neighbors:\n\n0: 10\n1: ? (No edges listed)\n2: ? (No edges)\n3: 10, 17\n4: ? (No edges)\n5: 7, 16, 15\n6: 15, 8, 7, 16\n7: 5, 6, 12\n8: 9, 6, 14\n9: 8, 19, 15\n10: 3, 0, 14\n11: 18\n12: 7, 17\n13: ?

They can be colored either 0 or 1; since we need exactly 2 colors, maybe assign some to 0 and others to 1, but let's focus on connected components first.\n\nFirst, let's handle connected components. The connected components are:\n\n- Component 1: 0,10,3,17,12,7,5,16,18,11,6,15,20,8,9,14,19. Let's check this. Starting from 0: 0-10, 10-3, 10-14, 3-17, 17-12, 12-7, 7-5, 7-6, 5-16, 6-15, 6-8, 8-9, 9-19, 15-20, 16-18, 18-11. So yes, that's a big component.\n\n- Component 2: 1 (isolated)\n- Component 3: 2 (isolated)\n- Component 4: 4 (isolated)\n- Component 5: 13 (isolated)\n\nSo the main component is the big one. Let's check if it's bipartite. Let's start BFS from node 0, assign color 0, then neighbors get color 1, etc.\n\nStart with 0: color 0.\n\n0's neighbor is 10: color 1.\n\n10's neighbors: 0 (0), 3, 14. 3 and 14 should be color 0.\n\n3's neighbors: 10 (1), 17. 17 should be color 1.\n\n17's neighbors: 3 (0), 12. 12 should be color 0.\n\n12's neighbors: 17 (1), 7. 7 should be color 1.\n\n7's neighbors: 12 (0), 5, 6. 5 and 6 should be color 0.\n\n5's neighbors: 7 (1), 16, 15. 16 and 15 should be color 1.\n\n16's neighbors: 5 (0), 6, 18. 6 is already 0 (from 7's neighbor), 18 should be color 1 (since 16 is 1).\n\nCheck 6: 6's neighbors are 15 (1), 8, 7 (1), 16 (1). So 6 is 0, so 8 should be color 1 (since 6 is 0).\n\n8's neighbors: 9, 6 (0), 14. 8 is 1, so 9 and 14 should be 0.\n\n14's neighbors: 8 (1), 10 (1). 14 is 0, which is okay (10 is 1, 8 is 1, 0 is 0).\n\n9's neighbors: 8 (1), 19, 15 (1). 9 is 0, so 19 and 15 (which is 1) is okay. 19 should be 1 (since 9 is 0).\n\n15's neighbors: 6 (0), 20, 5 (0), 9 (0). 15 is 1, so 20 should be 0.\n\n20's neighbor is 15 (1), so 20 is 0 (okay).\n\n18's neighbors: 16 (1), 11. 18 is 1, so 11 should be 0.\n\n11's neighbor is 18 (1), so 11 is 0 (okay).\n\nCheck 19: neighbor is 9 (0), so 19 is 1 (okay).\n\nNow let's check for conflicts:\n\n- 0:0, 10:1 (ok)\n- 10:1, 3:0 (ok), 14:0 (ok)\n- 3:0, 17:1 (ok)\n- 17:1, 12:0 (ok)\n- 12:0, 7:1 (ok)\n- 7:1, 5:0 (ok), 6:0 (ok)\n- 5:0, 16:1 (ok), 15:1 (ok)\n- 16:1, 6:0 (ok), 18:1 (ok) → 6 is 0, 16 is 1 (ok). 18 is 1, 16 is 1 → 18's neighbor 16 is 1, so 18 must be 0? Wait, wait, 16 is 1, 18 is connected to 16. So 18 should be 0. Oh, I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, 16 is color 1. 18 is a neighbor of 16, so 18 should be 0. Let's correct that.\n\n18's color: 0 (since 16 is 1). Then 11 is connected to 18, so 11 should be 1.\n\nLet's redo the 16-18-11 part:\n\n16 is 1 → 18 must be 0. 18's neighbor 11 must be 1 (since 18 is 0).\n\nThen 11:1.\n\nNow, 6's neighbors: 15 (1), 8, 7 (1), 16 (1). 6 is 0, so 8 should be 1 (ok). 8's neighbors: 9, 6 (0), 14. 8 is 1 → 9 and 14 should be 0. 14 is connected to 10 (1) and 8 (1) → 14 is 0 (ok). 9 is 0 → 9's neighbors: 8 (1), 19, 15 (1). 19 should be 1 (since 9 is 0). 15 is 1 (from 5's neighbor: 5 is 0, 15 is 1). 15's neighbors: 6 (0), 20, 5 (0), 9 (0). 15 is 1 → 20 should be 0 (ok). 20 is 0.\n\nCheck 6 and 16: 6 is 0, 16 is 1 (ok, they are connected). 6 and 7: 6 is 0, 7 is 1 (ok). 5 and 7: 5 is 0, 7 is 1 (ok). 5 and 15: 5 is 0, 15 is 1 (ok). 5 and 16: 5 is 0, 16 is 1 (ok). 7 and 12: 7 is 1, 12 is 0 (ok). 12 and 17: 12 is 0, 17 is 1 (ok). 17 and 3: 17 is 1, 3 is 0 (ok). 3 and 10: 3 is 0, 10 is 1 (ok). 10 and 0: 10 is 1, 0 is 0 (ok). 10 and 14: 10 is 1, 14 is 0 (ok). 14 and 8: 14 is 0, 8 is 1 (ok). 8 and 9: 8 is 1, 9 is 0 (ok). 9 and 19: 9 is 0, 19 is 1 (ok). 9 and 15: 9 is 0, 15 is 1 (ok). 15 and 20: 15 is 1, 20 is 0 (ok). 6 and 8: 6 is 0, 8 is 1 (ok). 16 and 18: 16 is 1, 18 is 0 (ok). 18 and 11: 18 is 0, 11 is 1 (ok). \n\nAny other edges? Let's check 6-15: 6 (0), 15 (1) → ok. 8-14: 8 (1), 14 (0) → ok. 6-7: 6 (0), 7 (1) → ok. 7-12: 7 (1), 12 (0) → ok. 6-16: 6 (0), 16 (1) → ok. 12-17: 12 (0), 17 (1) → ok. 3-17: 3 (0), 17 (1) → ok. 9-15: 9 (0), 15 (1) → ok. 11-18: 11 (1), 18 (0) → ok. \n\nWhat about node 19: connected to 9 (0), 19 is 1 → ok. Node 20: connected to 15 (1), 20 is 0 → ok. \n\nNow, the isolated nodes: 1,2,4,13. We can color them 0 or 1. Since we need exactly 2 colors, we need at least one node of color 0 and one of color 1. The main component has both colors, so the isolated nodes can be colored either. Let's assign 1:0, 2:1, 4:0, 13:1. That way, all isolated nodes are covered.\n\nLet's list all nodes:\n\n0:0\n\n1:0 (isolated)\n\n2:1 (isolated)\n\n3:0\n\n4:0 (isolated)\n\n5:0\n\n6:0\n\n7:1\n\n8:1\n\n9:0\n\n10:1\n\n11:1\n\n12:0\n\n13:1 (isolated)\n\n14:0\n\n15:1\n\n16:1\n\n17:1\n\n18:0\n\n19:1\n\n20:0\n\nWait, let's check each node's color and neighbors:\n\nCheck 18: color 0. Neighbors are 16 (1) and 11 (1) → ok.\n\nCheck 16: color 1. Neighbors 5 (0), 6 (0), 18 (0) → ok.\n\nCheck 5: color 0. Neighbors 7 (1), 16 (1), 15 (1) → ok.\n\nCheck 7: color 1. Neighbors 5 (0), 6 (0), 12 (0) → ok.\n\nCheck 12: color 0. Neighbors 7 (1), 17 (1) → ok.\n\nCheck 17: color 1. Neighbors 12 (0), 3 (0) → ok.\n\nCheck 3: color 0. Neighbors 10 (1), 17 (1) → ok.\n\nCheck 10: color 1. Neighbors 0 (0), 3 (0), 14 (0) → ok.\n\nCheck 0: color 0. Neighbor 10 (1) → ok.\n\nCheck 14: color 0. Neighbors 8 (1), 10 (1) → ok.\n\nCheck 8: color 1. Neighbors 9 (0), 6 (0), 14 (0) → ok.\n\nCheck 6: color 0. Neighbors 15 (1), 8 (1), 7 (1), 16 (1) → ok.\n\nCheck 15: color 1. Neighbors 6 (0), 20 (0), 5 (0), 9 (0) → ok.\n\nCheck 9: color 0. Neighbors 8 (1), 19 (1), 15 (1) → ok.\n\nCheck 19: color 1. Neighbor 9 (0) → ok.\n\nCheck 20: color 0. Neighbor 15 (1) → ok.\n\nCheck 11: color 1. Neighbor 18 (0) → ok.\n\nIsolated nodes (1,2,4,13) have no neighbors, so their colors are fine.\n\nYes, this should work. Now let's list all nodes with their colors:\n\n0:0\n\n1:0\n\n2:1\n\n3:0\n\n4:0\n\n5:0\n\n6:0\n\n7:1\n\n8:1\n\n9:0\n\n10:1\n\n11:1\n\n12:0\n\n13:1\n\n14:0\n\n15:1\n\n16:1\n\n17:1\n\n18:0\n\n19:1\n\n20:0\n\nLet me double-check a few more edges. For example, 6-15: 0 and 1 → ok. 5-16: 0 and 1 → ok. 8-9: 1 and 0 → ok. 10-14:1 and 0 → ok. 7-12:1 and 0 → ok. 16-18:1 and 0 → ok. 12-17:0 and 1 → ok. 3-17:0 and 1 → ok. 9-15:0 and 1 → ok. 11-18:1 and 0 → ok. All look good.\n\nThe isolated nodes are colored 0 or 1, which is allowed.

First, I need to understand the structure of the graph. Let's list all the nodes and their edges. The nodes are 0-18. Let's go through each edge and note the adjacency list for each node.\n\nStarting with node 0: edges are 0-8, 0-1, 0-13. So neighbors are 8,1,13.\n\nNode 1: 0-1, 1-7. Neighbors: 0,7.\n\nNode 2: 2-13, 2-6, 2-12. Neighbors:13,6,12.\n\nNode 3: 3-4, 3-10, 3-6, 3-5. Neighbors:4,10,6,5.\n\nNode 4: 3-4. Neighbor:3.\n\nNode 5: 3-5, 5-18.

Neighbor:8.\n\nNode 10: 3-10, 10-15, 6-10. Neighbors:3,15,6.\n\nNode 11: Wait, are there any edges for node 11? Let me check the edges again. The edges listed are: 6-18, 3-4, 3-10, 8-9, 0-8, 10-15, 3-6, 14-18, 5-18, 0-1, 0-13, 2-13, 15-16, 6-13, 6-10, 7-18, 3-5, 1-7, 2-6, 2-12. No edges mention node 11. So node 11 is isolated, has no neighbors.\n\nNode 12: 2-12. Neighbor:2.\n\nNode 13: 0-13, 2-13, 6-13. Neighbors:0,2,6.\n\nNode 14: 14-18. Neighbor:18.\n\nNode 15: 10-15, 15-16. Neighbors:10,16.\n\nNode 16: 15-16. Neighbor:15.\n\nNode 17: Wait, edges don't mention node 17 either. So node 17 is isolated.\n\nNode 18: 6-18, 14-18, 5-18, 7-18. Neighbors:6,14,5,7.\n\nSo nodes 11 and 17 are isolated; they can be colored with any color since they have no neighbors.\n\nNow, the goal is to color all nodes with 3 colors (0,1,2) such that adjacent nodes have different colors.\n\nLet's start with node 0. Let's assign color 0. Its neighbors are 8,1,13. So 8,1,13 can't be 0.\n\nNode 8: neighbor of 0. Let's color 8 with 1. Then node 9 (neighbor of 8) can't be 1. So 9 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0 for 9.\n\nNode 1: neighbor of 0 (color 0), so 1 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Then node 7 (neighbor of 1) can't be 1. Node 7 is also connected to 18. Let's keep 7 for later.\n\nNode 13: neighbor of 0 (color 0). Let's pick 1 for 13. Then node 13's neighbors are 0 (0), 2 (unknown), 6 (unknown). So 2 and 6 can't be 1.\n\nNode 2: neighbor of 13 (color 1), so 2 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. Node 2 is also connected to 6 and 12. So 6 and 12 can't be 0.\n\nNode 12: neighbor of 2 (color 0). So 12 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 6: connected to 18, 3, 13 (1), 10, 2 (0). So 6 can't be 1 (from 13) or 0 (from 2). So 6 must be 2. Then node 6's neighbors: 18 (can't be 2), 3 (can't be 2), 13 (1, okay), 10 (can't be 2), 2 (0, okay).\n\nNode 18: neighbors are 6 (2), 14, 5, 7. So 18 can't be 2. Let's pick 0. Then 14 (neighbor of 18) can't be 0; 5 (neighbor of 18) can't be 0; 7 (neighbor of 18) can't be 0.\n\nNode 14: neighbor of 18 (0), so 14 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 5: neighbor of 18 (0) and 3. So 5 can't be 0. Let's say 5 is 1. Then 3 (neighbor of 5) can't be 1.\n\nNode 3: neighbors are 4, 10, 6 (2), 5 (1). So 3 can't be 2 or 1. So 3 must be 0. Then 4 (neighbor of 3) can't be 0; 10 (neighbor of 3) can't be 0.\n\nNode 4: neighbor of 3 (0). So 4 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 10: neighbors are 3 (0), 15, 6 (2). So 10 can't be 0 or 2. So 10 must be 1. Then 15 (neighbor of 10) can't be 1.\n\nNode 15: neighbor of 10 (1) and 16. So 15 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. Then 16 (neighbor of 15) can't be 0.\n\nNode 16: neighbor of 15 (0). So 16 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 7: neighbors are 18 (0) and 1 (1). So 7 can't be 0 or 1. So 7 must be 2.\n\nNow let's check all nodes:\n\n0: color 0 (neighbors 8,1,13: 1,1,1 – all different, okay)\n\n1: color 1 (neighbors 0,7: 0,2 – okay)\n\n2: color 0 (neighbors 13,6,12: 1,2,1 – okay)\n\n3: color 0 (neighbors 4,10,6,5: 1,1,2,1 – okay)\n\n4: color 1 (neighbor 3: 0 – okay)\n\n5: color 1 (neighbors 3,18: 0,0 – okay)\n\n6: color 2 (neighbors 18,3,13,10,2: 0,0,1,1,0 – okay)\n\n7: color 2 (neighbors 18,1: 0,1 – okay)\n\n8: color 1 (neighbors 9,0: 0,0 – okay)\n\n9: color 0 (neighbor 8: 1 – okay)\n\n10: color 1 (neighbors 3,15,6: 0,0,2 – okay)\n\n11: isolated, can be any.

Let's pick color 0 for node 0. Then node 14 (connected to 0) can't be 0. Let's say node 14 is color 1. Then node 19 (connected to 14) can't be 1, so color 0 or 2. Let's pick 0 for 19.\n\nNode 4 is connected to 0 (color 0), so 4 can't be 0. Let's color 4 as 1. Node 15 is connected to 4 (1), 6, 17, 16, 7. Let's see node 15. Let's check 6: node 6 is connected to 15 and 2. Suppose 6's color. Node 2 is connected to 13, 3, 6. Let's move to node 1. Node 1 is connected to 5,7,10. Let's color node 1 as 0. Then 5,7,10 can't be 0. Node 5 is connected to 16,1 (0),17. So 5 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 5 is 1. Then 16 (connected to 5) can't be 1. 16 is also connected to 7 and 15. 7 is connected to 16,15,4,1 (0). Let's see 7: connected to 1 (0), so 7 can be 1 or 2. 4 is 1, so 7 can't be 1 (since 4 is 1). So 7 must be 2. Then 16 is connected to 7 (2) and 5 (1), so 16 can be 0. Then 15 is connected to 4 (1), 6, 17, 16 (0), 7 (2). So 15's neighbors are 1,0,2. So 15 can't be 0,1,2? Wait, that's a problem. Because 15 is connected to 4 (1), 16 (0), 7 (2). So 15's neighbors have colors 1,0,2. So 15 would need a 4th color, which we don't have. So my previous choices are wrong.\n\nLet's backtrack. Maybe 7's color. Node 7 is connected to 1 (0), 4 (1), 15, 16. If 4 is 1, then 7 can't be 1. 1 is 0, so 7 can't be 0. So 7 must be 2. Then 16 is connected to 7 (2), 5 (1). So 16 can be 0. Then 15 is connected to 4 (1), 6, 17, 16 (0), 7 (2). So 15's neighbors have 0,1,2. So 15 can't be any color. That's a conflict. So maybe 4's color is 2 instead. Let's try again.\n\nNode 0: color 0. Node 14: connected to 0, so color 1. Node 19: connected to 14 (1), so color 0. Node 4: connected to 0 (0), so color 1 or 2. Let's pick 2. Then 7 is connected to 4 (2), 1 (needs color). Let's set node 1: color 0. Then 7 is connected to 1 (0), so 7 can't be 0. 4 is 2, so 7 can't be 2. So 7 must be 1. Then 16 is connected to 7 (1), 5 (connected to 1 (0)). Node 5 is connected to 1 (0), so 5 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 5 as 2. Then 16 is connected to 5 (2) and 7 (1), so 16 can be 0. 15 is connected to 4 (2), 6, 17, 16 (0), 7 (1). So 15's neighbors are 0,1,2. Again, 15 needs a 4th color. Hmm, same problem. So 15 is connected to 4,6,17,16,7. Let's see 15's degree is 5. So 3-coloring might require that 15's neighbors don't use all 3 colors.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for cliques. A clique is a set of nodes where each is connected to the others. Let's check if there's a 3-clique. For example, node 15 is connected to 4,7,16. Are 4,7,16 all connected to each other? 4-7 is an edge (yes, 4-7 is in edges). 4-16? 4 is connected to 15,0,7. 16 is connected to 5,7,15. So 4 and 16 are not connected. 7-16 is an edge (yes, 7-16 is in edges). So 4,7,15: 4-7, 4-15, 7-15 are edges. So 4,7,15 form a triangle (3-clique). So those three nodes must all have different colors. So 4,7,15 need colors 0,1,2 in some order.\n\nLet's assign 4:0, 7:1, 15:2. Then 4's neighbors: 15 (2), 0, 7 (1). So node 0 can't be 0 (since 4 is 0). So node 0 can be 1 or 2. Let's say node 0:1. Then node 14 (connected to 0) can't be 1. Node 14 is connected to 19. Let's assign 14:0, 19:1 (since 14 is 0, 19 can't be 0).\n\nNode 7 is 1. Its neighbors: 16 (connected to 7), 15 (2), 4 (0), 1. So node 1 can't be 1. Let's assign node 1:0. Then node 1's neighbors: 5,7 (1),10. So 5 can't be 0 (since 1 is 0). 5 is connected to 16 and 17. Let's look at 16: connected to 5,7 (1),15 (2). So 16 can't be 1 or 2. So 16 must be 0. Then 5 is connected to 16 (0), so 5 can't be 0. 5 is connected to 1 (0), so 5 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 5:1. Then 17 is connected to 15 (2) and 5 (1). So 17 can be 0.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 15 (2) and 2. 15 is 2, so 6 can't be 2. Let's see node 2: connected to 13,3,6. Let's assign 6:0. Then node 2 can't be 0 (if 6 is 0). 2's neighbors: 13,3,6 (0). So 2 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 2:1. Then 13 is connected to 9 and 2 (1). So 13 can't be 1. 13 is connected to 2 (1), 9. Let's assign 13:0. Then 9 is connected to 13 (0), so 9 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 9:1.\n\nNode 3 is connected to 11 and 2 (1). So 3 can't be 1. Let's assign 3:0. Then 11 is connected to 3 (0) and 18. 11 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 11:1. Then 18 is connected to 11 (1), so 18 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 18:0.\n\nNode 10 is connected to 12 and 1 (0). So 10 can't be 0. Let's assign 10:1. Then 12 is connected to 10 (1), so 12 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 12:0.\n\nNode 8 is isolated, so any color. Let's pick 8:0.\n\nNow let's check all nodes:\n\n0:1 (neighbors 14 (0),4 (0) → okay, 1≠0)\n1:0 (neighbors 5 (1),7 (1),10 (1) → 0≠1)\n2:1 (neighbors 13 (0),3 (0),6 (0) → 1≠0)\n3:0 (neighbors 11 (1),2 (1) → 0≠1)\n4:0 (neighbors 15 (2),0 (1),7 (1) → 0≠2,1)\n5:1 (neighbors 16 (0),1 (0),17 (0) → 1≠0)\n6:0 (neighbors 15 (2),2 (1) → 0≠2,1)\n7:1 (neighbors 16 (0),15 (2),4 (0),1 (0) → 1≠0,2)\n8:0 (no neighbors)\n9:1 (neighbors 13 (0) → 1≠0)\n10:1 (neighbors 12 (0),1 (0) → 1≠0)\n11:1 (neighbors 3 (0),18 (0) → 1≠0)\n12:0 (neighbors 10 (1) → 0≠1)\n13:0 (neighbors 9 (1),2 (1) → 0≠1)\n14:0 (neighbors 19 (1),0 (1) → 0≠1)\n15:2 (neighbors 6 (0),4 (0),17 (0),16 (0),7 (1) → 2≠0,1)\n16:0 (neighbors 5 (1),7 (1),15 (2) → 0≠1,2)\n17:0 (neighbors 15 (2),5 (1) → 0≠2,1)\n18:0 (neighbors 11 (1) → 0≠1)\n19:1 (neighbors 14 (0) → 1≠0)\n\nWait, let's check node 15 again. Its neighbors are 6 (0),4 (0),17 (0),16 (0),7 (1). So 15 is 2, which is different from 0 and 1. Good.\n\nNode 17 is 0, neighbors 15 (2),5 (1) → 0≠2,1. Good.\n\nNode 16 is 0, neighbors 5 (1),7 (1),15 (2) → 0≠1,2. Good.\n\nNode 4 is 0, neighbors 15 (2),0 (1),7 (1) → 0≠2,1. Good.\n\nNode 7 is 1, neighbors 16 (0),15 (2),4 (0),1 (0) → 1≠0,2.

But since the problem says to use exactly 3, we can assume it's 3-colorable.\n\nLet's start with node 0. Let's assign color 0. Node 0 is connected to 2, 14, 13. So 2,14,13 can't be 0.\n\nNode 1: Let's check its neighbors. 1 is connected to 6. Let's assign 1 a color, say 1. Then 6 can't be 1.\n\nNode 2: Connected to 0 (color 0) and 3, 18. So 2 can be 1 (since 0 is 0). Then 3 and 18 can't be 1.\n\nNode 3: Connected to 2 (color 1). So 3 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 4: Let's see its neighbors. 4 is connected to 23. 23's neighbors are 11,13,4. Let's hold on 4 for now.\n\nNode 5: Connected to 25, 22, 21. 25 is connected to 14,5,1. 14 is connected to 0 (color 0) and 25. 14 can't be 0, so 14 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 14 color 1. Then 25 (connected to 14) can't be 1. 25 is also connected to 5 and 1 (color 1). So 25 can't be 1. So 25 could be 0 or 2. Let's say 25 is 0. Then 5 (connected to 25) can't be 0. 5 is also connected to 22 and 21. Let's assign 5 color 1. Then 22 and 21 can't be 1.\n\nNode 6: Connected to 1 (color 1), 8, 16, 19. 1 is 1, so 6 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 6 is 0. Then 8,16,19 can't be 0.\n\nNode 7: Connected to 19. 19 is connected to 6 (color 0) and 7. Let's assign 7 color 1. Then 19 can't be 1. 19 is already can't be 0 (from 6), so 19 must be 2.\n\nNode 8: Connected to 6 (color 0). So 8 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 9: Connected to 18. 18 is connected to 15, 2, 11, 9. Let's check 15. 15 is connected to 26, 18, 22. 22 is connected to 5 (color 1) and 15. Let's assign 15 color 0. Then 26 (connected to 15) can't be 0. 26 is also connected to 21. 21 is connected to 10, 5 (color 1), 20, 26. 20 is connected to 16. 16 is connected to 20, 11, 6 (color 0). 16 can't be 0 (from 6). Let's see 11: connected to 23, 16, 18, 24, 27. 11's neighbors: 23,16,18,24,27.\n\nLet's backtrack. Node 0: color 0. Node 1: color 1. Node 2: connected to 0 (0) and 3, 18. Let's set 2 to color 1. Then 3 can be 0 or 2. Let's set 3 to 0. Node 13: connected to 12, 23, 0 (0). So 13 can't be 0. Let's set 13 to 1. Then 12 (connected to 13) can't be 1, so 12 can be 0 or 2. Let's set 12 to 0.\n\nNode 23: connected to 11, 13 (1), 4. So 23 can't be 1. Let's set 23 to 0. Then 11 (connected to 23) can't be 0. 11 is connected to 16, 18, 24, 27. Let's set 11 to 1. Then 16 (connected to 11) can't be 1. 16 is also connected to 20 and 6 (0). So 16 can't be 0 (from 6) or 1 (from 11), so 16 must be 2. Then 20 (connected to 16) can't be 2. 20 is connected to 21. 21 is connected to 10, 5 (1), 20, 26. Let's set 20 to 0. Then 21 (connected to 20) can't be 0. 21 is connected to 5 (1), so 21 can't be 1. So 21 must be 2. Then 26 (connected to 21) can't be 2. 26 is connected to 15. 15 is connected to 26, 18, 22. Let's set 15 to 1. Then 26 (connected to 15) can't be 1, and 26 can't be 2 (from 21), so 26 must be 0.\n\nNode 18: connected to 15 (1), 2 (1), 11 (1), 9, 24. 18 is connected to three nodes with color 1, so 18 can't be 1. So 18 must be 0 or 2. Let's set 18 to 0. Then 9 (connected to 18) can't be 0. 9 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 9 to 1. 24 (connected to 18) can't be 0. 24 is connected to 11 (1), so 24 can't be 1. So 24 must be 2. 27 (connected to 11) can't be 1. 27 can be 0 or 2. Let's set 27 to 0.\n\nNode 4: connected to 23 (0). So 4 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 4 to 1.\n\nNode 5: connected to 25, 22, 21 (2). 21 is 2, so 5 can't be 2. 25 is connected to 14,5,1 (1). 1 is 1, so 25 can't be 1. 14 is connected to 0 (0) and 25. Let's set 14 to 2. Then 25 (connected to 14) can't be 2. 25 is connected to 1 (1), so 25 can't be 1. So 25 must be 0. Then 5 (connected to 25) can't be 0. 5 is connected to 22 and 21 (2). So 5 can be 1. Set 5 to 1.\n\nNode 22: connected to 5 (1) and 15 (1). So 22 can't be 1. 22 can be 0 or 2. Let's set 22 to 0.\n\nNode 10: connected to 21 (2) and 17. 21 is 2, so 10 can be 0 or 1. Let's set 10 to 0. Then 17 (connected to 10) can't be 0. 17 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 17 to 1.\n\nNode 7: connected to 19. 19 is connected to 6 (0). 6 is connected to 1 (1), 8, 16 (2), 19. 6 was set to 0. 19 can't be 0 (from 6) or 1 (if 7 is 1). Let's set 7 to 1. Then 19 can't be 1. So 19 must be 2. That works.\n\nNode 8: connected to 6 (0). So 8 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 8 to 1.\n\nLet's check all nodes now:\n\n0:0, 1:1, 2:1, 3:0, 4:1, 5:1, 6:0, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:0, 11:1, 12:0, 13:1, 14:2, 15:1, 16:2, 17:1, 18:0, 19:2, 20:0, 21:2, 22:0, 23:0, 24:2, 25:0, 26:0, 27:0.\n\nWait, need to check for conflicts. Let's check node 23 (color 0). Its neighbors are 11 (1), 13 (1), 4 (1) – okay. Node 16 (color 2) neighbors: 20 (0), 11 (1), 6 (0) – okay. Node 21 (color 2) neighbors: 10 (0), 5 (1), 20 (0), 26 (0) – okay. Node 26 (color 0) neighbors: 15 (1), 21 (2) – okay. Node 18 (color 0) neighbors: 15 (1), 2 (1), 11 (1), 9 (1), 24 (2) – okay. Node 24 (color 2) neighbors: 18 (0), 11 (1) – okay. Node 25 (color 0) neighbors: 14 (2), 5 (1), 1 (1) – okay. Node 14 (color 2) neighbors: 0 (0), 25 (0) – okay. Node 12 (color 0) neighbor 13 (1) – okay. Node 13 (color 1) neighbors 12 (0), 23 (0), 0 (0) – okay. Node 10 (color 0) neighbor 17 (1) – okay. Node 17 (color 1) neighbor 10 (0) – okay. Node 7 (color 1) neighbor 19 (2) – okay. Node 19 (color 2) neighbors 6 (0), 7 (1) – okay. Node 8 (color 1) neighbor 6 (0) – okay. Node 9 (color 1) neighbor 18 (0) – okay. Node 3 (color 0) neighbor 2 (1) – okay. Node 4 (color 1) neighbor 23 (0) – okay. Node 22 (color 0) neighbors 5 (1), 15 (1) – okay. Node 27 (color 0) neighbor 11 (1) – okay.\n\nWait, node 2: color 1, neighbors 0 (0), 3 (0), 18 (0) – okay. Node 0: color 0, neighbors 2 (1), 14 (2), 13 (1) – okay. Node 1: color 1, neighbors 6 (0) – okay. Node 6: color 0, neighbors 1 (1), 8 (1), 16 (2), 19 (2) – okay. Node 5: color 1, neighbors 25 (0), 22 (0), 21 (2) – okay. Node 20: color 0, neighbors 16 (2), 21 (2) – okay. Node 11: color 1, neighbors 23 (0), 16 (2), 18 (0), 24 (2), 27 (0) – okay.\n\nLooks like all adjacent nodes have different colors. Let's confirm all edges:\n\n16-20: 2 vs 0 – ok. 12-13: 0 vs 1 – ok. 0-2: 0 vs 1 – ok. 14-25: 2 vs 0 – ok. 5-25: 1 vs 0 – ok. 1-6: 1 vs 0 – ok. 0-14: 0 vs 2 – ok. 5-22:1 vs 0 – ok. 11-23:1 vs 0 – ok. 10-21:0 vs 2 – ok. 13-23:1 vs 0 – ok. 6-8:0 vs 1 – ok. 7-19:1 vs 2 – ok. 15-26:1 vs 0 – ok. 5-21:1 vs 2 – ok. 4-23:1 vs 0 – ok. 11-16:1 vs 2 – ok. 0-13:0 vs 1 – ok. 10-17:0 vs 1 – ok. 15-18:1 vs 0 – ok. 6-16:0 vs 2 – ok. 15-22:1 vs 0 – ok. 6-19:0 vs 2 – ok. 18-24:0 vs 2 – ok. 20-21:0 vs 2 – ok. 21-26:2 vs 0 – ok. 2-3:1 vs 0 – ok. 9-18:1 vs 0 – ok. 2-18:1 vs 0 – ok. 11-18:1 vs 0 – ok. 11-24:1 vs 2 – ok. 1-25:1 vs 0 – ok. 11-27:1 vs 0 – ok.\n\nAll edges are between different colors. So this coloring works with 3 colors.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 0], [4, 1], [5, 1], [6, 0], [7, 1], [8, 1], [9, 1], [10, 0], [11, 1], [12, 0], [13, 1], [14, 2], [15, 1], [16, 2], [17, 1], [18, 0], [19, 2], [20, 0], [21, 2], [22, 0], [23, 0], [24, 2], [25, 0], [26, 0], [27, 0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

First, I need to list all the nodes and their connections. Let's start by identifying the nodes and their neighbors. Maybe building an adjacency list would help.\n\nNodes are 0-33. Let's list edges:\n\n15-21, 16-20, 6-15, 16-32, 7-29, 20-26, 5-10, 14-25, 8-12, 3-28, 17-18, 2-5, 10-12, 5-28, 5-31, 2-23, 1-33, 20-28, 14-15, 23-30, 4-23, 11-13, 19-20, 30-32, 2-13, 0-28, 9-31, 13-19, 20-21, 12-17, 20-30, 4-19, 5-8, 4-25, 10-16, 9-18, 19-28, 11-27, 10-31.\n\nLet's build adjacency lists for each node:\n\n0: [28]\n1: [33]\n2: [5, 23, 13]\n3: [28]\n4: [23, 19, 25]\n5: [10, 2, 28, 31, 8]\n6: [15]\n7: [29]\n8: [12, 5]\n9: [31, 18]\n10: [5, 12, 16, 31]\n11: [13, 27]\n12: [8, 10, 17]\n13: [11, 2, 19]\n14: [25, 15]\n15: [21, 6, 14]\n16: [20, 32, 10]\n17: [18, 12]\n18: [17, 9]\n19: [20, 13, 4, 28]\n20: [16, 26, 28, 19, 21, 30]\n21: [15, 20]\n22: ? Wait, looking back at edges, is 22 connected to any node? Let me check all edges again. The edges listed don't include 22. So 22 is an isolated node.

That's easy, they can take any color. Let's note that.\n\nNow, let's start with nodes that have high degrees. Let's see which nodes have the most connections. Let's check node 20: connected to 16,26,28,19,21,30. Degree 6. Node 5: connected to 10,2,28,31,8. Degree 5. Node 19: 20,13,4,28. Degree 4. Node 28: 3,5,0,20,19. Degree 5. Node 10: 5,12,16,31. Degree 4. Node 12: 8,10,17. Degree 3. Node 2: 5,23,13. Degree 3. Node 13: 11,2,19. Degree 3. Node 4: 23,19,25. Degree 3. Node 23: 2,30,4. Degree 3. Node 16: 20,32,10. Degree 3. Node 30: 23,32,20. Degree 3. Node 31: 5,9,10. Degree 3. Node 15: 21,6,14. Degree 3. Node 21: 15,20. Degree 2. Node 14: 25,15. Degree 2. Node 25: 14,4. Degree 2. Node 8: 12,5. Degree 2. Node 6: 15. Degree 1. Node 7: 29. Degree 1. Node 26: 20. Degree 1. Node 27: 11. Degree 1. Node 29: 7. Degree 1. Node 3: 28. Degree 1. Node 0: 28. Degree 1. Node 1: 33. Degree 1. Node 33: 1. Degree 1. Node 17: 18,12. Degree 2. Node 18: 17,9. Degree 2. Node 9: 31,18. Degree 2. Node 32: 16,30. Degree 2.\n\nSo node 20 is connected to many nodes. Let's try to color node 20 first. Let's assign color 0 to node 20. Then its neighbors (16,26,28,19,21,30) can't be 0.\n\nNeighbor 16: connected to 20 (0), 32, 10. So 16 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNeighbor 26: connected to 20 (0). So 26 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNeighbor 28: connected to 20 (0), and 3,5,0,19. Let's note 28 can't be 0. Let's leave 28 for later.\n\nNeighbor 19: connected to 20 (0), 13,4,28. So 19 can't be 0. Let's assign 1.\n\nNeighbor 21: connected to 20 (0) and 15. 21 can't be 0. Let's assign 1.\n\nNeighbor 30: connected to 20 (0), 23, 32. 30 can't be 0. Let's assign 1.\n\nNow, 16 is color 1. 16's neighbors are 20 (0), 32, 10. So 32 and 10 can't be 1.\n\n32 is connected to 16 (1) and 30 (1). So 32 can't be 1. 30 is 1, so 32 can't be 1. 32's possible colors: 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\n10 is connected to 16 (1), 5, 12, 31. 10 can't be 1. Let's assign 0.\n\n10 is 0. 10's neighbors: 5, 12, 16 (1), 31. So 5,12,31 can't be 0.\n\n5 is connected to 10 (0), 2, 28, 31, 8. 5 can't be 0. Let's assign 1.\n\n5 is 1. 5's neighbors: 10 (0), 2, 28, 31, 8. So 2, 28, 31, 8 can't be 1.\n\n2 is connected to 5 (1), 23, 13. 2 can't be 1. Let's assign 0.\n\n2 is 0. 2's neighbors: 5 (1), 23, 13. So 23 and 13 can't be 0.\n\n13 is connected to 2 (0), 11, 19 (1). 13 can't be 0 or 1. So 13 must be 2.\n\n13 is 2. 13's neighbors: 2 (0), 11, 19 (1). So 11 can't be 2 (since 13 is 2) and 19 is 1. So 11 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\n11 is 0. 11's neighbors: 13 (2), 27. So 27 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\n27 is 1.\n\n19 is 1. 19's neighbors: 20 (0), 13 (2), 4, 28. So 4 and 28 can't be 1.\n\n4 is connected to 19 (1), 23, 25. 4 can't be 1. 23 is connected to 2 (0), 30 (1), 4. 23 can't be 0 (from 2) or 1 (from 30). So 23 must be 2.\n\n23 is 2. 23's neighbors: 2 (0), 30 (1), 4. So 4 can't be 2. 4 can't be 1 (from 19), so 4 must be 0.\n\n4 is 0. 4's neighbors: 23 (2), 19 (1), 25. So 25 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\n25 is 1. 25's neighbors: 4 (0), 14. So 14 can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\n14 is 0. 14's neighbors: 25 (1), 15. So 15 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\n15 is 1. 15's neighbors: 21 (1), 6. 21 is 1, so 15 and 21 are both 1. But 15-21 is an edge, so that's a problem. Oh, right! 15 is connected to 21. So 15 and 21 can't have the same color. 21 is currently 1, so 15 can't be 1. So 15's color was 1, but that's conflicting with 21 (1). Let's backtrack.\n\nEarlier, 21 was assigned 1. 21 is connected to 15 and 20 (0). So 21 can be 1 or 2. Let's change 21 to 2. Then 15 can be 1. Let's try that.\n\nSo 21 is 2. 15's neighbors: 21 (2), 6, 14 (0). So 15 can be 1 (since 0 and 2 are taken by 14 and 21). So 15 is 1. That's okay.\n\n15 is 1. 6 is connected to 15 (1), so 6 can be 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\n6 is 0.\n\n21 is 2. 21's neighbors: 15 (1), 20 (0). Okay.\n\nNow, 19 is 1. 19's neighbor 4 is 0. 4's neighbor 25 is 1. 25's neighbor 14 is 0. 14's neighbor 15 is 1. That's good.\n\nBack to 28. 28 is connected to 3,5 (1), 0, 20 (0), 19 (1). So 28's neighbors have colors 1,0,1. So 28 can't be 0 or 1. So 28 must be 2.\n\n28 is 2. 28's neighbors: 3,5 (1), 0, 20 (0), 19 (1). So 3,0 can't be 2.\n\n3 is connected to 28 (2). So 3 can be 0 or 1. Assign 0.\n\n0 is connected to 28 (2). So 0 can be 0 or 1. Assign 0.\n\n0 is 0. 3 is 0. That's okay, they are not connected.\n\n19 is 1. 19's neighbor 28 is 2. Good.\n\n20 is 0. 20's neighbor 28 is 2. Good.\n\n5 is 1. 5's neighbor 28 is 2. Good.\n\nNow, 8 is connected to 12 and 5 (1). 5 is 1, so 8 can't be 1. Let's see 12's color. 12 is connected to 8, 10 (0), 17. 10 is 0, so 12 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 1 to 12. Then 8 can't be 1 (since 5 is 1 and 8 is connected to 5). 8 is connected to 12 (1), so 8 can't be 1. So 8 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\n8 is 0. 12 is 1. 12's neighbors: 8 (0), 10 (0), 17. So 17 can't be 1 (since 12 is 1). 17 is connected to 18 and 12 (1). So 17 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\n17 is 0. 17's neighbor 18 is connected to 17 (0) and 9. 18 can be 1 or 2. 9 is connected to 31 and 18. Let's see 31's color. 31 is connected to 5 (1), 9, 10 (0). 10 is 0, 5 is 1, so 31 can be 2. 31 is 2. Then 9 is connected to 31 (2) and 18. 9 can be 0 or 1. Let's assign 0. 18 is connected to 17 (0) and 9 (0). So 18 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\n18 is 1. 9 is 0. 9's neighbors: 31 (2), 18 (1). Good.\n\n17 is 0. 18 is 1.

Let's pick 0. 12:0.\n\nNode 15 is connected to 1 (2) and 12 (0). So 15 can't be 2 or 0. So 15 must be 1. 15:1.\n\nNode 20 is connected to 13 (0) and 1 (2). So 20 can't be 0 or 2. So 20:1.\n\nNode 4 is connected to 1 (2) and 16. Let's see. Node 1's color is 2, so 4 can't be 2. Let's color 4 with 0. 4:0.\n\nNode 16 is connected to 3,5,4 (0). So 16 can't be 0.

So 17:0.\n\nNode 11 is connected to 7 (1). So 11 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. 11:0.\n\nNode 2: isolated, can be any color. Let's pick 0. 2:0.\n\nLet's check all nodes:\n\n0:0.

Oh, conflict! Node 3 and 4 are connected (from edge 1-3 and 1-4, but 3-4? Wait, the edges are 1-3, 1-4, 4-16, 3-16. So 3 and 4 are connected via node 1? No, 3 and 4 are not directly connected. Let's check edges again. The edges are: 3-16, 5-16, 1-6, 0-14, 19-21, 1-3, 10-21, 1-15, 13-20, 6-8, 7-13, 12-15, 10-17, 1-20, 13-19, 6-13, 7-21, 6-19, 4-16, 17-19, 0-9, 1-4, 0-6, 0-18, 7-11. So 1-4 is an edge. So node 1 is connected to 4. So 4's neighbors are 1 (2) and 16 (1). So 4 is 0, which is okay. 3's neighbors are 16 (1), 1 (2). 3 is 0. 3 and 4 are not connected. So 3 and 4 can both be 0. My mistake earlier. 3 and 4 are not directly connected. So that's okay.\n\n4:0. Neighbors 1 (2),16 (1) → okay.\n\n5:0. Neighbor 16 (1) → okay.\n\n6:1.

First, I need to list all the nodes and their edges to understand the connections. The nodes are 0-39, and there are a bunch of edges. Let's start by identifying some key nodes with high degrees to handle them first, as they might be more constrained.\n\nLooking at the edges, let's count the degree of each node:\n\n- Node 16 is connected to 35, 9, 11, 4, 8, 23. That's 6 edges. So degree 6.\n- Node 21 is connected to 25, 34, 3, 5, 39. That's 5 edges. Degree 5.\n- Node 33 is connected to 15, 3, 5, 9. Degree 4.\n- Node 39 is connected to 21, 27, 14. Degree 3.\n- Node 5 is connected to 19, 21, 33, 36. Degree 4.\n- Node 3 is connected to 34, 21, 33, 26. Degree 4.\n- Node 22 is connected to 28, 0, 30, 36. Degree 4.\n- Node 11 is connected to 0, 16, 25. Degree 3.\n- Node 25 is connected to 21, 11, 6. Degree 3.\n- Node 28 is connected to 22, 9, 29. Degree 3.\n- Node 9 is connected to 16, 28, 33. Degree 3.\n- Node 4 is connected to 12, 16, 19, 31. Degree 4.\n- Node 19 is connected to 5, 7, 2, 4. Degree 4.\n- Node 30 is connected to 0, 22. Degree 2.\n- Node 15 is connected to 33. Degree 1.\n- Node 18 is connected to 32, 17. Degree 2.\n- Node 32 is connected to 18. Degree 1.\n- Node 17 is connected to 18. Degree 1.\n- Node 7 is connected to 19, 37. Degree 2.\n- Node 37 is connected to 7. Degree 1.\n- Node 26 is connected to 36, 3. Degree 2.\n- Node 36 is connected to 26, 5, 22. Degree 3.\n- Node 10 is connected to 23, 29, 13. Degree 3.\n- Node 23 is connected to 10, 16. Degree 2.\n- Node 29 is connected to 28, 10. Degree 2.\n- Node 13 is connected to 10. Degree 1.\n- Node 2 is connected to 19.

Degree 1.\n- Node 27 is connected to 39. Degree 1.\n- Node 14 is connected to 39. Degree 1.\n\nNodes with higher degrees (like 16, 21, 4, 19) are critical. Let's start with node 0. Node 0 is connected to 30 and 11 and 22. Let's assign color 0 to node 0. Then its neighbors 30, 11, 22 can't be 0.\n\nNode 16 has neighbors 35,9,11,4,8,23. Let's see, node 11 is connected to 0 and 16. If 0 is color 0, 11 can't be 0. Let's assign 11 color 1. Then 16 can't be 1. Let's try 16 color 0. Then 35 (connected to 16 and 31) can't be 0. 31 is connected to 4. Let's check 4: connected to 12,16,19,31. 16 is 0, so 4 can't be 0. Let's assign 4 color 1. Then 12 (connected to 4) can't be 1, so 12 color 0 or 2. Let's say 0. 31 (connected to 4) can't be 1, so 31 color 0 or 2. 35 is connected to 16 (0) and 31. If 31 is 2, then 35 can be 1.\n\nNode 21 is connected to 25,34,3,5,39. Let's see node 25 is connected to 21,11,6. 11 is color 1, so 25 can't be 1. Let's assign 25 color 0. Then 21 can't be 0. 21's neighbors: 25 (0), 34,3,5,39. Let's assign 21 color 1. Then 34 (connected to 21 and 3) can't be 1. 3 is connected to 34,21,33,26. 21 is 1, so 3 can't be 1. Let's assign 3 color 0. Then 34 (connected to 3 and 21) can't be 0 or 1, so 34 color 2. 33 is connected to 15,3,5,9. 3 is 0, so 33 can't be 0. Let's assign 33 color 1. 5 is connected to 19,21,33,36. 21 is 1, 33 is 1, so 5 can't be 1. Let's assign 5 color 0. 36 is connected to 26,5,22. 5 is 0, so 36 can't be 0. 22 is connected to 28,0,30,36. 0 is 0, so 22 can't be 0. Let's say 22 color 1. Then 36 (connected to 22) can't be 1, so 36 color 2. 26 is connected to 36 and 3. 3 is 0, 36 is 2, so 26 can be 1.\n\nNode 19 is connected to 5,7,2,4. 5 is 0, 4 is 1, so 19 can't be 0 or 1. So 19 must be 2. Then 7 (connected to 19 and 37) can't be 2. 7 can be 0 or 1. Let's assign 7 color 0. 37 (connected to 7) can't be 0, so 37 color 1. 2 (connected to 19) can't be 2, so 2 color 0 or 1. Let's say 0.\n\nNode 28 is connected to 22,9,29. 22 is 1, so 28 can't be 1. Let's assign 28 color 0. 9 is connected to 16,28,33. 16 is 0, 28 is 0, 33 is 1. So 9 can't be 0. Assign 9 color 2. 29 is connected to 28 and 10. 28 is 0, so 29 can't be 0. Let's assign 29 color 1. 10 is connected to 23,29,13. 29 is 1, so 10 can't be 1. Let's assign 10 color 0. 23 is connected to 10 and 16. 10 is 0, 16 is 0, so 23 can't be 0. Assign 23 color 1. 13 (connected to 10) can't be 0, so 13 color 1 or 2. Let's say 1.\n\nNode 8 is connected to 16 (0), so 8 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 8 color 1. Node 6 is connected to 25 (0), so 6 can be 1 or 2. Assign 6 color 1. Node 30 is connected to 0 (0) and 22 (1), so 30 can be 2. Node 15 is connected to 33 (1), so 15 can be 0 or 2. Assign 0. Node 18 is connected to 32 and 17. 18's degree 2. Let's assign 18 color 0. 32 connected to 18 (0), so 32 color 1. 17 connected to 18 (0), so 17 color 1. Node 39 is connected to 21 (1),27,14. 21 is 1, so 39 can't be 1. Assign 39 color 0. 27 connected to 39 (0), so 27 color 1. 14 connected to 39 (0), so 14 color 1. \n\nLet's check if any conflicts:\n\n- Node 0 (0) connected to 30 (2), 11 (1), 22 (1) → ok.\n- Node 16 (0) connected to 35 (1),9 (2),11 (1),4 (1),8 (1),23 (1) → ok (all not 0).\n- Node 21 (1) connected to 25 (0),34 (2),3 (0),5 (0),39 (0) → ok.\n- Node 33 (1) connected to 15 (0),3 (0),5 (0),9 (2) → ok.\n- Node 5 (0) connected to 19 (2),21 (1),33 (1),36 (2) → ok.\n- Node 3 (0) connected to 34 (2),21 (1),33 (1),26 (1) → ok.\n- Node 22 (1) connected to 28 (0),0 (0),30 (2),36 (2) → ok.\n- Node 11 (1) connected to 0 (0),16 (0),25 (0) → ok.\n- Node 25 (0) connected to 21 (1),11 (1),6 (1) → ok.\n- Node 28 (0) connected to 22 (1),9 (2),29 (1) → ok.\n- Node 9 (2) connected to 16 (0),28 (0),33 (1) → ok.\n- Node 4 (1) connected to 12 (0),16 (0),19 (2),31 (2) → ok. 12 (0) is connected to 4 (1) → ok. 31 (2) connected to 4 (1) → ok.\n- Node 19 (2) connected to 5 (0),7 (0),2 (0),4 (1) → ok. 7 (0) connected to 19 (2) and 37 (1) → ok. 37 (1) → ok. 2 (0) connected to 19 (2) → ok.\n- Node 30 (2) connected to 0 (0),22 (1) → ok.\n- Node 15 (0) connected to 33 (1) → ok.\n- Node 18 (0) connected to 32 (1),17 (1) → ok. 32 (1) → ok. 17 (1) → ok.\n- Node 36 (2) connected to 26 (1),5 (0),22 (1) → ok. 26 (1) connected to 36 (2),3 (0) → ok.\n- Node 10 (0) connected to 23 (1),29 (1),13 (1) → ok. 23 (1) connected to 10 (0),16 (0) → ok. 29 (1) connected to 28 (0),10 (0) → ok. 13 (1) connected to 10 (0) → ok.\n- Node 8 (1) connected to 16 (0) → ok.\n- Node 6 (1) connected to 25 (0) → ok.\n- Node 39 (0) connected to 21 (1),27 (1),14 (1) → ok. 27 (1) → ok. 14 (1) → ok.\n\nLooks like all adjacent nodes have different colors. Let's list all nodes and their colors:\n\n0:0, 1:?, 2:0, 3:0, 4:1, 5:0, 6:1, 7:0, 8:1, 9:2, 10:0, 11:1, 12:0, 13:1, 14:1, 15:0, 16:0, 17:1, 18:0, 19:2, 20:?, 21:1, 22:1, 23:1, 24:?, 25:0, 26:1, 27:1, 28:0, 29:1, 30:2, 31:2, 32:1, 33:1, 34:2, 35:1, 36:2, 37:1, 38:?, 39:0.\n\nWait, nodes 1,20,24,38 are not mentioned in the edges. So they are isolated. For isolated nodes, we can assign any color. Since we need exactly 3 colors, but isolated nodes can be colored with any. Let's assign them color 0,1,2,0 to cover all. Let's check:\n\nNode 1: since it's isolated, color 0.\nNode 20: isolated, color 1.\nNode 24: isolated, color 2.\nNode 38: isolated, color 0.\n\nNow check all:\n\n[0,0], [1,0], [2,0], [3,0], [4,1], [5,0], [6,1], [7,0], [8,1], [9,2], [10,0], [11,1], [12,0], [13,1], [14,1], [15,0], [16,0], [17,1], [18,0], [19,2], [20,1], [21,1], [22,1], [23,1], [24,2], [25,0], [26,1], [27,1], [28,0], [29,1], [30,2], [31,2], [32,1], [33,1], [34,2], [35,1], [36,2], [37,1], [38,0], [39,0].\n\nWait, node 31: connected to 4 (1), so 31 can be 0,2.

Node 5 is connected to 7,16,4,6,12—degree 5. Node 4: 6,12,5,7,10—degree 5. Node 2: 11,8,7—degree 3. Node 13: 3,0,1,14—degree 4. Node 7: 5,2,4,14—degree 4. Node 8: 12,2,16—degree 3. Node 12: 4,8,5—degree 3. \n\nSince we need 3 colors, let's start with nodes that have fewer connections first. Let's start with node 9, which is only connected to 0. Assign color 0 to node 9. Then node 0 is connected to 9 and 13. Let's assign color 1 to node 0. Then node 13 is connected to 0,1,3,14. Node 0 has color 1, so node 13 can't be 1. Let's try color 0. Then node 1 (connected to 13) can't be 0. Assign color 1. Node 3 (connected to 13) can't be 0, assign color 1. Node 14 is connected to 13 (0) and 7. Let's assign 14 a color, say 2. \n\nNode 7 is connected to 5,2,4,14 (color 2). So 7 can't be 2. Let's see 7's neighbors. Let's hold on 7 for a moment. Let's look at node 10, connected to 4. Assign 10 color 0 (since 4 hasn't been colored yet, but 10 is only connected to 4). Node 6 is connected to 4 and 5. Let's assign 6 color 0. Then node 4 is connected to 6 (0), 12, 5, 7, 10 (0). So 4 can't be 0. Let's try color 1 for 4. Then node 12 is connected to 4 (1), 8, 5. 12 can't be 1. Assign 0. Node 5 is connected to 4 (1), 6 (0), 12 (0), 7, 16. So 5 can't be 0 or 1. Must be 2. Now node 5 is color 2. \n\nNode 7 is connected to 5 (2), 2, 4 (1), 14 (2). So 7 can't be 1 or 2. Must be 0. So 7 is 0. Then node 2 is connected to 11, 8, 7 (0). So 2 can't be 0. Assign 1. Node 8 is connected to 12 (0), 2 (1), 16. So 8 can't be 0 or 1. Must be 2. Node 16 is connected to 5 (2) and 8 (2). So 16 can't be 2. Assign 0 or 1. Let's do 0. \n\nNode 11 is connected to 2 (1) and 15. Assign 11 color 0. Then node 15 is connected to 11 (0), so 15 can be 1. \n\nLet's check all nodes:\n\n0: connected to 13 (0) and 9 (0). 0's color is 1. Okay (no conflict with 0's neighbors 13 (0) and 9 (0)).\n\n1: connected to 13 (0). 1's color is 1. Okay.\n\n2: connected to 11 (0), 8 (2), 7 (0). 2's color is 1. Okay.\n\n3: connected to 13 (0). 3's color is 1. Okay.\n\n4: connected to 6 (0), 12 (0), 5 (2), 7 (0), 10 (0). 4's color is 1. Okay.\n\n5: connected to 7 (0), 16 (0), 4 (1), 6 (0), 12 (0). 5's color is 2. Okay.\n\n6: connected to 4 (1), 5 (2). 6's color is 0. Okay.\n\n7: connected to 5 (2), 2 (1), 4 (1), 14 (2). 7's color is 0. Okay.\n\n8: connected to 12 (0), 2 (1), 16 (0). 8's color is 2. Okay.\n\n9: connected to 0 (1). 9's color is 0. Okay.\n\n10: connected to 4 (1). 10's color is 0. Okay.\n\n11: connected to 2 (1), 15 (1). 11's color is 0. Okay (15 is 1, 11 is 0: no conflict).\n\n12: connected to 4 (1), 8 (2), 5 (2). 12's color is 0. Okay.\n\n13: connected to 3 (1), 0 (1), 1 (1), 14 (2). 13's color is 0. Okay.\n\n14: connected to 13 (0), 7 (0). 14's color is 2. Okay.\n\n15: connected to 11 (0). 15's color is 1. Okay.\n\n16: connected to 5 (2), 8 (2). 16's color is 0. Okay.\n\nAll colors are 0,1,2. No adjacent nodes share the same color.

Let's color node 26 with color 0.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 0 and 26. If 26 is 0, then 1 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 1 as 1. Then node 0 is connected to 1 (color 1) and 18. So 0 can be 0 or 2.

Let's say 1.\n\nNode 38 is connected to 18, 22 (0), 21. 22 is 0, so 38 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Node 18 is connected to 29, 38 (1), 0 (2). 0 is 2, 38 is 1, so 18 can be 0. Let's set 18 to 0. Then node 29 is connected to 18 (0), so 29 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 1. Node 21 is connected to 38 (1) and 44. So 21 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. Node 44 is connected to 40 and 21 (0). So 44 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Node 40 is connected to 44 (1) and 26 (0). So 40 can be 2. Good.\n\nNode 35 is connected to 4 and 8. Let's color 35. Let's say 35 can be 0.

First, I need to list all the nodes and their edges. Let's start by listing all the nodes from 0 to 43. Then, for each node, note its neighbors. The key is to assign colors such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.\n\nFirst, let's list some of the nodes and their connections to understand the structure. Let's pick node 1, which is connected to 15, 39, 26, 41. So node 1's neighbors are 15,39,26,41. Node 41 is connected to 25,11,13,8,30,1, so that's a high-degree node. Node 33 is connected to 38,11,21,0, so node 33's neighbors are 38,11,21,0.\n\nSince we can use 3 colors, maybe we can start by picking a node with high degree and assign it a color, then assign different colors to its neighbors. Let's start with node 0. Node 0 is connected to 33. Let's color node 0 as color 0. Then node 33 can't be 0. Node 33 is connected to 38,11,21,0. Let's say node 33 is color 1. Then node 38 (connected to 33) can't be 1, so maybe 0 or 2. Node 11 is connected to 32,41,33,43. Node 11 is connected to 33 (color 1), so node 11 can be 0 or 2. Let's see node 41: connected to 25,11,13,8,30,1. Let's say node 41 is color 0. Then node 11 (connected to 41) can't be 0, so node 11 is color 2 (since 33 is 1, 11 can't be 1). So node 11 is 2. Then node 32 (connected to 11) can't be 2. Node 32 is also connected to 24,19,21,5. Let's check node 21: connected to 4,33,32. Node 33 is 1, so node 21 can't be 1. If node 21 is 0, then node 32 (connected to 21) can't be 0. Node 32 is connected to 11 (2), so node 32 can be 0 or 1. Let's say node 32 is 1. Then node 24 (connected to 32) can't be 1. Node 24 is connected to 25, so node 25 (connected to 24) can't be same as 24. Node 25 is connected to 41 (0), so 25 can't be 0. If node 24 is 0, then 25 can't be 0 or 24's color (0), so 25 can be 1 or 2. But 25 is connected to 41 (0), so 25 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 25 is 1. Then node 24 (connected to 25) can't be 1, so 24 is 0 (since 24 was connected to 32 (1), 24 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. \n\nNode 1 is connected to 15,39,26,41 (0). So node 1 can't be 0. Let's say node 1 is color 1. Then node 15 (connected to 1) can't be 1. Node 15 is connected to 8,1. Node 8 is connected to 15,41,19. Node 41 is 0, so 8 can't be 0. Node 8 is connected to 19. Let's check node 19: connected to 16,39,32,31,8. Node 32 is 1, so 19 can't be 1. Node 39 is connected to 19,1,7,18. Node 1 is 1, so 39 can't be 1. Let's say node 39 is 0. Then node 19 (connected to 39) can't be 0, so 19 can be 2 (since 32 is 1, 19 can't be 1). So node 19 is 2. Then node 8 (connected to 19) can't be 2. Node 8 is connected to 41 (0), so 8 can't be 0. So 8 must be 1. Then node 15 (connected to 8) can't be 1. Node 15 is connected to 1 (1), so 15 can't be 1. So 15 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. \n\nNode 30 is connected to 13,6,41,16. Node 41 is 0, so 30 can't be 0. Node 16 is connected to 3,19,31,37,30. Node 19 is 2, so 16 can't be 2. Let's see node 16: connected to 3 (unknown), 19 (2), 31 (unknown), 37 (unknown), 30 (unknown). Let's say node 16 is 0. Then node 30 (connected to 16) can't be 0, so 30 can be 1 or 2. Node 30 is connected to 41 (0), so 30 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 30 is 1. Then node 13 (connected to 30) can't be 1. Node 13 is connected to 41 (0), so 13 can't be 0. So 13 must be 2. \n\nNode 6 is connected to 30 (1), 36. So node 6 can't be 1. Let's say node 6 is 0. Then node 36 (connected to 6) can't be 0. Node 36 is connected to 43. Node 43 is connected to 10,36,11,17. Node 11 is 2, so 43 can't be 2. Node 36 is connected to 43, so let's say node 36 is 1. Then node 43 (connected to 36) can't be 1. Node 43 is connected to 11 (2), so 43 can't be 2. So 43 must be 0. Then node 10 (connected to 43) can't be 0. Node 10 is connected to 4. Node 4 is connected to 21,10,25. Node 21 is 0 (earlier assumption), so 4 can't be 0. Node 4 is connected to 25 (1), so 4 can't be 1. So 4 must be 2. Then node 10 (connected to 4) can't be 2. Node 10 is connected to 43 (0), so 10 can be 1. \n\nNode 26 is connected to 18,1. Node 1 is 1, so 26 can't be 1. Let's say node 26 is 0. Then node 18 (connected to 26) can't be 0. Node 18 is connected to 39 (0), so 18 can't be 0. Node 18 is connected to 39 (0), so 18 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 18 is 1. \n\nNode 7 is connected to 20,39. Node 39 is 0, so 7 can't be 0. Let's say node 7 is 1. Then node 20 (connected to 7) can't be 1. Node 20 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. \n\nNode 27 is connected to 17,23. Node 17 is connected to 27,43. Node 43 is 0, so 17 can't be 0. Let's say node 17 is 1. Then node 27 (connected to 17) can't be 1. Node 27 is connected to 23 (unknown), so 27 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. Then node 23 (connected to 27) can't be 0, so 23 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. \n\nNode 31 is connected to 16 (0), 19 (2). So 31 can't be 0 or 2, so 31 must be 1. \n\nNode 37 is connected to 16 (0), so 37 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. \n\nNode 5 is connected to 32 (1), 29. Node 32 is 1, so 5 can't be 1. Let's say 5 is 0. Then node 29 (connected to 5) can't be 0. 29 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. \n\nNode 22 is connected to 34. Let's color 22 as 0, 34 as 1. \n\nNode 35 is connected to 40. Let's color 35 as 0, 40 as 1. \n\nNode 28 is connected to 42. Let's color 28 as 0, 42 as 1. \n\nNode 14 is connected to 42 (1), so 14 can't be 1. 14 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. \n\nNow, let's check all nodes:\n\n0: connected to 33 (1) → 0 is 0 ✔️\n\n1: connected to 15 (0), 39 (0), 26 (0), 41 (0) → 1 is 1 ✔️ (all neighbors 0, so 1 is okay)\n\n2: not connected to anyone (assuming no edges listed for 2).

First, I need to list all the nodes and their edges to understand the adjacency. The nodes are 0-9. Let's list the adjacency for each node:\n\nNode 0: connected to 6, 2. So neighbors are 6 and 2.\nNode 1: connected to 2, 6. Neighbors: 2, 6.\nNode 2: connected to 1, 3, 0. Neighbors: 1, 3, 0.\nNode 3: connected to 8, 2, 9, 5. Neighbors: 8, 2, 9, 5.\nNode 4: Wait, does node 4 have any edges? Let me check the edges list again. The edges given are: 3-8, 1-2, 6-8, 0-6, 2-3, 0-2, 3-9, 5-6, 1-6, 6-9, 3-5, 7-8. Oh, node 4 isn't mentioned in any edge. So node 4 is isolated, has no neighbors.\nNode 5: connected to 6, 3. Neighbors: 6, 3.\nNode 6: connected to 8, 0, 1, 5, 9.

Neighbors: 3, 6.\n\nSo node 4 is isolated, so it can take any color, since it has no neighbors. Let's note that.\n\nNow, let's start with node 6, since it seems to have a lot of neighbors (8,0,1,5,9). Let's pick a color for node 6 first. Let's say color 0.\n\nNode 6: color 0.\n\nNow, neighbors of 6 are 8,0,1,5,9. They can't be 0.\n\nNode 0 is connected to 6 and 2. Since 6 is 0, node 0 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. So node 0: 1.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 6 (0) and 2. So node 1 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1? Wait, but node 0 is 1, but node 1 is connected to node 2, not node 0. So node 1 can be 1. Wait, but let's check node 2. Node 2 is connected to 0 (1), 1, and 3. So node 2's neighbors are 0 (1), 1 (unknown), and 3 (unknown). Let's see. Let's pick node 1's color. Suppose node 1 is 2. Then node 2's neighbors are 0 (1), 1 (2). So node 2 can be 0. Let's try that.\n\nNode 1: 2. Then node 2 is connected to 0 (1), 1 (2), so node 2 can be 0. Node 2: 0.\n\nNow node 3 is connected to 2 (0), 8 (neighbor of 6, which is 0, so 8 can't be 0), 9 (neighbor of 6, 0), and 5 (neighbor of 6, 0). Let's look at node 3's neighbors: 2 (0), 8 (unknown), 9 (unknown), 5 (unknown). Let's see node 8. Node 8 is connected to 3, 6 (0), 7. So node 8 can't be 0. Let's pick color for node 8. Suppose node 8 is 1. Then node 3 is connected to 8 (1), 2 (0), so node 3 can be 2. So node 3: 2.\n\nNode 5 is connected to 6 (0) and 3 (2). So node 5 can't be 0 or 2. So node 5 must be 1. Node 5: 1.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 3 (2) and 6 (0). So node 9 can't be 0 or 2, so must be 1. Node 9: 1.\n\nNode 7 is connected to 8 (1). So node 7 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. Node 7: 0.\n\nNow let's check all nodes:\n\nNode 0: 1 (neighbors 6 (0), 2 (0) → okay)\nNode 1: 2 (neighbors 2 (0), 6 (0) → okay)\nNode 2: 0 (neighbors 0 (1), 1 (2), 3 (2) → okay)\nNode 3: 2 (neighbors 8 (1), 2 (0), 9 (1), 5 (1) → okay)\nNode 4: no neighbors, can be 0. Node 4: 0.\nNode 5: 1 (neighbors 6 (0), 3 (2) → okay)\nNode 6: 0 (neighbors 8 (1), 0 (1), 1 (2), 5 (1), 9 (1) → okay)\nNode 7: 0 (neighbor 8 (1) → okay)\nNode 8: 1 (neighbors 3 (2), 6 (0), 7 (0) → okay)\nNode 9: 1 (neighbors 3 (2), 6 (0) → okay)\n\nLet me check all edges:\n\n3-8: 2 and 1 → different. Good.\n1-2: 2 and 0 → different. Good.\n6-8: 0 and 1 → different. Good.\n0-6: 1 and 0 → different. Good.\n2-3: 0 and 2 → different. Good.\n0-2: 1 and 0 → different. Good.\n3-9: 2 and 1 → different.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the graph based on the given edges. Let's list all the nodes and their neighbors. \n\nNodes are 0-13. Let's list each node's adjacent nodes:\n\n- Node 0: 7, 13, 9, 8, 11 (edges: 0-7, 0-13, 0-9, 0-8, 0-11)\n- Node 1: 5 (edge: 1-5)\n- Node 2: 4, 12 (edges: 2-4, 2-12)\n- Node 3: 11 (edge: 3-11)\n- Node 4: 2 (edge: 2-4)\n- Node 5: 1, 8, 7 (edges: 1-5, 5-8, 5-7)\n- Node 6: Let's check edges.

Node 0 has degree 5, node 8 has degree 4, node 11 has degree 4, node 7 has degree 3, node 5 has degree 3, etc. The isolated nodes (6,10) can be colored with any color, but since we need exactly 3 colors, maybe we can assign them different ones if needed.\n\nWe need to use 3 colors (0,1,2). Let's start with high-degree nodes first.\n\nStarting with node 0. Let's assign color 0. Then its neighbors (7,13,9,8,11) cannot be 0.\n\nNode 11 is connected to 0,8,7,3. Let's look at node 11's neighbors. 0 is color 0, 8 is connected to 0 (so 8 can't be 0). Let's pick node 8 next. Node 8 is connected to 0 (color 0), 5, 12, 11. So 8 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 8 is color 1. Then 11, which is connected to 8 (color 1) and 0 (color 0), so 11 can be 2. That's good.\n\nNode 7 is connected to 0 (0), 5, 11 (2). So 7 can't be 0 or 2. So 7 must be 1.\n\nNode 5 is connected to 1, 8 (1), 7 (1). So 5 can't be 1. Let's check 5's neighbors: 1 (unknown), 8 (1), 7 (1). So 5 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. Then node 1 is connected to 5 (0), so node 1 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 1.\n\nNode 13 is connected to 0 (0), so 13 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 0 (0), so 9 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 2.\n\nNode 11 is color 2. Node 3 is connected to 11 (2), so 3 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 12 is connected to 2 and 8 (1). So 12 can't be 1. Let's see 12's neighbors: 2 (unknown), 8 (1). So 12 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. Then node 2 is connected to 4 and 12 (0). So 2 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Then node 4 is connected to 2 (1), so 4 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNow check node 6 and 10, which are isolated. They can be colored with any color, but since we need to use exactly 3 colors, let's make sure all three colors are used. So far, colors used are 0,1,2 (e.g., 0:0, 1:1, 9:2, etc.). So maybe 6 can be 2 and 10 can be 0. Let's check.\n\nLet's list all assignments step by step to check for conflicts:\n\n- 0:0\n- 8:1 (connected to 0, which is 0)\n- 11:2 (connected to 0 (0), 8 (1), 7 (to be assigned), 3 (to be assigned))\n- 7: connected to 0 (0), 5, 11 (2). So 7 can't be 0 or 2, so 7:1. Check 7-8? 8 is 1, 7 is 1. Oh, 7 and 8: 0-7, 5-7, 7-11. Wait, 7 and 8: are they connected? Let's check edges. The edges given: 0-7, 2-4, 1-5, 5-8, 0-13, 0-9, 5-7, 2-12, 8-12, 8-11, 0-8, 7-11, 0-11, 3-11. So 7 and 8: 5-7 and 5-8, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected. So 7 and 8 can have the same color. That's okay.\n\nSo 7:1 is okay.\n\nNode 5: connected to 1, 8 (1), 7 (1). So 5 can't be 1. Let's assign 5:0. Then node 1 is connected to 5 (0), so 1 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1:1.\n\nNode 13: connected to 0 (0), so 13 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 13:1.\n\nNode 9: connected to 0 (0), so 9:2.\n\nNode 3: connected to 11 (2), so 3 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 3:0.\n\nNode 12: connected to 2 and 8 (1). 8 is 1, so 12 can't be 1. Let's assign 12:0. Then node 2 is connected to 4 and 12 (0). So 2 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 2:1. Then node 4 is connected to 2 (1), so 4 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 4:0.\n\nNode 6: isolated. Let's assign 6:2 (since 2 is a color we need to use, and 6 is isolated, no conflict).\n\nNode 10: isolated. Assign 10:0 (since 0 is used, no conflict).\n\nNow let's check all nodes:\n\n0:0 (neighbors 7,13,9,8,11: 7 is 1, 13 is 1, 9 is 2, 8 is 1, 11 is 2 → no conflicts)\n1:1 (neighbor 5: 0 → okay)\n2:1 (neighbors 4:0, 12:0 → okay)\n3:0 (neighbor 11:2 → okay)\n4:0 (neighbor 2:1 → okay)\n5:0 (neighbors 1:1, 8:1, 7:1 → okay)\n6:2 (no neighbors → okay)\n7:1 (neighbors 0:0, 5:0, 11:2 → okay)\n8:1 (neighbors 5:0, 12:0, 11:2, 0:0 → okay)\n9:2 (neighbor 0:0 → okay)\n10:0 (no neighbors → okay)\n11:2 (neighbors 8:1, 7:1, 0:0, 3:0 → okay)\n12:0 (neighbors 2:1, 8:1 → okay)\n13:1 (neighbor 0:0 → okay)\n\nAll colors are 0,1,2. Let's check if any adjacent nodes have the same color. For example:\n\n0 (0) and 7 (1): ok\n0 and 13 (1): ok\n0 and 9 (2): ok\n0 and 8 (1): ok\n0 and 11 (2): ok\n\n1 (1) and 5 (0): ok\n\n2 (1) and 4 (0): ok\n2 and 12 (0): ok\n\n3 (0) and 11 (2): ok\n\n5 (0) and 8 (1): ok\n5 and 7 (1): ok\n\n7 (1) and 11 (2): ok\n\n8 (1) and 12 (0): ok\n8 and 11 (2): ok\n\n11 (2) and 3 (0): ok\n\nAll look good. And all three colors are used (0,1,2).

The goal is to color 46 nodes (0-45) with 3 colors (0,1,2) such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. First, I need to understand the structure of the graph by looking at the edges provided. Let's list out all the edges to see which nodes are connected:\n\nEdges:\n0-30, 0-22, 0-3\n7-23, 7-20, 7-3, 7-2, 7-4\n33-42, 33-19, 33-43, 33-11\n18-20, 18-43\n20-32, 20-35, 20-41, 20-17, 20-7, 20-18\n12-22, 12-43\n29-38\n34-37, 34-41\n3-31, 3-7, 3-0\n28-30\n17-30, 17-27, 17-20, 17-26\n14-40, 23-40, 4-40, 4-13, 4-31, 4-7\n24-41, 24-25\n5-9\n39-41\n38-43, 38-29\n19-26, 19-29, 19-35, 19-33\n15-32, 15-43\n22-30, 22-12, 22-0\n11-43, 11-33\n35-43, 35-20, 35-19\nSo, nodes with many connections (high degree) are likely critical. Let's find the maximum degree to check if 3 colors are feasible. For example, node 20 is connected to 7,18,32,35,41,17 – that's 6 edges. Node 43 is connected to 12,18,38,11,33,35,15 – 7 edges. Node 7 is connected to 23,20,3,2,4 – 5 edges. Node 33 is connected to 42,19,43,11 – 4 edges. Node 19 is connected to 26,29,35,33 – 4 edges. Node 30 is connected to 0,28,17,22 – 4 edges. Node 4 is connected to 7,13,31,40 – 4 edges. Node 17 is connected to 30,27,20,26 – 4 edges. Node 35 is connected to 20,19,43 – 3 edges. Node 15 is connected to 32,43 – 2 edges. \n\nWait, but 3-coloring is possible if the graph is not a complete graph of 4 nodes, and if it's not an odd cycle, but even with high degrees, 3 colors might be possible. Let's start by picking a node with high degree, say node 43. Let's list its neighbors: 12,18,38,11,33,35,15. So node 43 needs a color different from all these. Let's assign color 0 to 43. Then its neighbors 12,18,38,11,33,35,15 must be 1 or 2.\n\nNext, node 20 has neighbors 7,18,32,35,41,17. Let's say node 20 is color 0. Then 7,18,32,35,41,17 must be 1 or 2. Node 18 is a neighbor of 20 and 43. If 43 is 0 and 20 is 0, then 18 can't be 0. So 18 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 18 is 1. Then 20 (0) and 43 (0) are okay. Node 38 is a neighbor of 29 and 43. 43 is 0, so 38 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 38 is 1. Then 29 (neighbor of 38) can't be 1. 29 is also connected to 19, so 29's color is 0 or 2. 19 is connected to 26,29,35,33. Let's assign 19 color 0. Then 29 (connected to 19) can't be 0, so 29 must be 2. 38 is 1, 29 is 2: okay. 35 is connected to 20 (0) and 19 (0), so 35 can be 1 or 2. 35 is also connected to 43 (0), so 35 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 35 is 1. Then 43 (0) and 20 (0), 19 (0) are okay. 35's color 1. 15 is connected to 32 and 43 (0). Let's say 15 is 1. Then 43 (0) is okay, 32 (connected to 15) can't be 1. 32 is connected to 20 (0) and 15 (1). So 32 can be 2. 20 (0) is okay, 15 (1) is okay. 32 color 2.\n\nNode 7 is connected to 23,20 (0),3,2,4. Let's assign 7 color 1. Then 20 (0) is okay. 23 (neighbor of 7) can't be 1. 23 is also connected to 40. 40 is connected to 14,23,4. Let's see 4: connected to 7 (1),13,31,40. 4 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 4 color 0. Then 7 (1) is okay. 40 is connected to 4 (0),14,23. 40 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 40 is 1. Then 4 (0) is okay. 23 (connected to 7 (1) and 40 (1)) must be 0 or 2. Let's assign 23 color 0. 7 (1) and 40 (1) are okay. 14 (connected to 40 (1)) can be 0 or 2. Let's say 14 color 0. 40 (1) is okay.\n\nNode 3 is connected to 7 (1),31,0. Let's assign 3 color 0. Then 7 (1) is okay. 31 is connected to 3 (0) and 4 (0). So 31 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 31 color 1. 3 (0) and 4 (0) are okay. 0 is connected to 30,22,3 (0). 0 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 0 color 1. 3 (0) is okay. 30 is connected to 0 (1),28,17,22. 30 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 30 color 0. 0 (1) is okay. 28 (connected to 30 (0)) can be 1 or 2. Let's say 28 color 1. 30 (0) is okay. 22 is connected to 0 (1),12,30 (0). 22 can be 2. 0 (1) and 30 (0) are okay. 12 is connected to 22 (2) and 43 (0). 12 can be 1. 22 (2) and 43 (0) are okay. 11 is connected to 43 (0) and 33. 11 can be 1. 43 (0) is okay. 33 is connected to 42,19 (0),43 (0),11 (1). 33 can be 2. 19 (0), 43 (0), 11 (1) are okay. 42 is connected to 33 (2). 42 can be 0 or 1. Let's say 42 color 0. 33 (2) is okay.\n\nNode 17 is connected to 30 (0),27,20 (0),26. 17 can be 1. 30 (0) and 20 (0) are okay. 27 (connected to 17 (1)) can be 0 or 2. Let's say 27 color 0. 17 (1) is okay. 26 is connected to 17 (1) and 19 (0). 26 can be 2. 17 (1) and 19 (0) are okay. 24 is connected to 41 and 25. 41 is connected to 20 (0),24,34,39. 20 (0) so 41 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 41 color 1. Then 20 (0) is okay. 24 (connected to 41 (1)) can be 0 or 2. Let's say 24 color 0. 41 (1) is okay. 25 (connected to 24 (0)) can be 1 or 2. Let's say 25 color 1. 24 (0) is okay. 34 is connected to 37 and 41 (1). 34 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 34 color 0. 41 (1) is okay. 37 (connected to 34 (0)) can be 1 or 2. Let's say 37 color 1. 34 (0) is okay. 39 is connected to 41 (1). 39 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 39 color 0. 41 (1) is okay.\n\nNode 2 is connected to 7 (1). 2 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 2 color 0. 7 (1) is okay. Node 5 is connected to 9. Let's assign 5 color 0, 9 color 1 (since they are connected, different colors). Node 13 is connected to 4 (0). 13 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 13 color 1. 4 (0) is okay. Nodes 1,6,8,10,16, etc. are not mentioned in any edges, so they can be colored with any color, as they have no neighbors. Let's assign them color 0,1,2 in a way to use all 3 colors. For example: 1→0, 6→1, 8→2, 10→0, 16→1, 21→2, 36→0, 44→1, 45→2.\n\nLet me check a few connections to ensure no conflicts:\n\n- 0 (1) connected to 30 (0), 22 (2), 3 (0): all different. Good.\n- 7 (1) connected to 23 (0), 20 (0), 3 (0), 2 (0), 4 (0): all different. Good.\n- 20 (0) connected to 7 (1), 18 (1), 32 (2), 35 (1), 41 (1), 17 (1): 0 vs 1,2,1,1,1. Wait, 20 (0) and 18 (1): okay. 20 (0) and 32 (2): okay. 20 (0) and 35 (1): okay. 20 (0) and 41 (1): okay. 20 (0) and 17 (1): okay. So 20 is 0, neighbors are 1 or 2. Good.\n- 43 (0) connected to 12 (1), 18 (1), 38 (1), 11 (1), 33 (2), 35 (1), 15 (1): 0 vs 1,2. All neighbors are 1 or 2. Good.\n- 19 (0) connected to 26 (2), 29 (2), 35 (1), 33 (2): 0 vs 2,2,1,2. All different. Good.\n- 33 (2) connected to 42 (0), 19 (0), 43 (0), 11 (1): 2 vs 0,0,0,1. All different. Good.\n- 30 (0) connected to 0 (1), 28 (1), 17 (1), 22 (2): 0 vs 1,1,1,2. All different. Good.\n- 4 (0) connected to 7 (1), 13 (1), 31 (1), 40 (1): 0 vs 1. All different. Good.\n- 17 (1) connected to 30 (0), 27 (0), 20 (0), 26 (2): 1 vs 0,0,0,2. All different. Good.\n- 35 (1) connected to 20 (0), 19 (0), 43 (0): 1 vs 0. All different. Good.\n- 15 (1) connected to 32 (2), 43 (0): 1 vs 2,0. All different. Good.\n- 22 (2) connected to 0 (1), 12 (1), 30 (0): 2 vs 1,1,0. All different. Good.\n- 12 (1) connected to 22 (2), 43 (0): 1 vs 2,0. All different. Good.\n- 11 (1) connected to 43 (0), 33 (2): 1 vs 0,2. All different. Good.\n- 38 (1) connected to 29 (2), 43 (0): 1 vs 2,0. All different. Good.\n- 29 (2) connected to 38 (1), 19 (0): 2 vs 1,0. All different. Good.\n- 26 (2) connected to 17 (1), 19 (0): 2 vs 1,0. All different. Good.\n- 41 (1) connected to 20 (0), 24 (0), 34 (0), 39 (0): 1 vs 0. All different. Good.\n- 24 (0) connected to 41 (1), 25 (1): 0 vs 1,1. All different. Good.\n- 25 (1) connected to 24 (0): 1 vs 0. Good.\n- 34 (0) connected to 37 (1), 41 (1): 0 vs 1,1. Good.\n- 37 (1) connected to 34 (0): 1 vs 0. Good.\n- 39 (0) connected to 41 (1): 0 vs 1. Good.\n- 2 (0) connected to 7 (1): 0 vs 1. Good.\n- 5 (0) connected to 9 (1): 0 vs 1. Good.\n- 13 (1) connected to 4 (0): 1 vs 0. Good.\n- 32 (2) connected to 20 (0), 15 (1): 2 vs 0,1. Good.\n- 42 (0) connected to 33 (2): 0 vs 2. Good.\n- 28 (1) connected to 30 (0): 1 vs 0. Good.\n- 27 (0) connected to 17 (1): 0 vs 1. Good.\n- 14 (0) connected to 40 (1): 0 vs 1. Good.\n- 40 (1) connected to 14 (0), 23 (0), 4 (0): 1 vs 0,0,0. Good.\n- 23 (0) connected to 7 (1), 40 (1): 0 vs 1,1. Good.\n- 3 (0) connected to 7 (1), 31 (1), 0 (1): 0 vs 1,1,1. Good.\n- 31 (1) connected to 3 (0), 4 (0): 1 vs 0,0. Good.\n- Nodes with no edges (1,6,8,10,16,21,36,44,45) can be colored any, as long as they don't conflict (but they have no neighbors). So 1:0, 6:1, 8:2, 10:0, 16:1, 21:2, 36:0, 44:1, 45:2.\n\nThis seems to work. Let's list all nodes:\n\n0:1, 1:0, 2:0, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:1, 7:1, 8:2, 9:1, 10:0, 11:1, 12:1, 13:1, 14:0, 15:1, 16:1, 17:1, 18:1, 19:0, 20:0, 21:2, 22:2, 23:0, 24:0, 25:1, 26:2, 27:0, 28:1, 29:2, 30:0, 31:1, 32:2, 33:2, 34:0, 35:1, 36:0, 37:1, 38:1, 39:0, 40:1, 41:1, 42:0, 43:0, 44:1, 45:2.\n\nWait, let's check 43:0. Its neighbors: 12 (1), 18 (1), 38 (1), 11 (1), 33 (2), 35 (1), 15 (1). All different from 0. Good. 20:0, neighbors 7 (1), 18 (1), 32 (2), 35 (1), 41 (1), 17 (1). All different. 7:1, neighbors 23 (0), 20 (0), 3 (0), 2 (0), 4 (0). All different. 19:0, neighbors 26 (2), 29 (2), 35 (1), 33 (2). All different. 33:2, neighbors 42 (0), 19 (0), 43 (0), 11 (1). All different. 30:0, neighbors 0 (1), 28 (1), 17 (1), 22 (2). All different. 4:0, neighbors 7 (1), 13 (1), 31 (1), 40 (1). All different. 17:1, neighbors 30 (0), 27 (0), 20 (0), 26 (2).

All different. 12:1, neighbors 22 (2), 43 (0). All different. 11:1, neighbors 43 (0), 33 (2). All different. 38:1, neighbors 29 (2), 43 (0). All different. 29:2, neighbors 38 (1), 19 (0). All different. 26:2, neighbors 17 (1), 19 (0). All different. 41:1, neighbors 20 (0), 24 (0), 34 (0), 39 (0). All different. 24:0, neighbors 41 (1), 25 (1). All different. 25:1, neighbors 24 (0). All different. 34:0, neighbors 37 (1), 41 (1). All different. 37:1, neighbors 34 (0). All different. 39:0, neighbors 41 (1). All different. 2:0, neighbors 7 (1). All different. 5:0, neighbors 9 (1). All different. 13:1, neighbors 4 (0). All different. 32:2, neighbors 20 (0), 15 (1). All different. 42:0, neighbors 33 (2). All different. 28:1, neighbors 30 (0). All different. 27:0, neighbors 17 (1). All different. 14:0, neighbors 40 (1). All different. 40:1, neighbors 14 (0), 23 (0), 4 (0). All different. 23:0, neighbors 7 (1), 40 (1). All different. 3:0, neighbors 7 (1), 31 (1), 0 (1). All different. 31:1, neighbors 3 (0), 4 (0). All different.

First, I need to understand the structure of the graph. Let's list out all the nodes and their connections. The nodes are 0 to 42, so 43 nodes in total. The edges are given, so I need to check the adjacency for each node.\n\nFirst, let's note the degrees of some nodes to see which ones are high-degree, as they might be critical. For example, node 37 is connected to 10, 1, 7, 18, 6. That's 5 edges. Node 26 is connected to 7, 20, 14, 19, 29. Also 5. Node 19 is connected to 21, 33, 26, 4, 40. 5 edges. Node 24 is connected to 23, 3, 18. 3 edges. Node 33 is connected to 30, 19, 5. 3 edges. \n\nSince we need 3 colors, the graph's chromatic number must be at most 3. Let's start by picking a node and assigning a color, then proceed to its neighbors, ensuring no two adjacent nodes have the same color.\n\nLet's start with node 0. It's connected to 9. Let's color 0 with color 0. Then node 9 can't be 0. Let's say 9 is color 1. Node 9 is also connected to 32, so 32 can't be 1. Maybe 32 is 0 or 2. Let's pick 0 for 32.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 37 and 14. Let's color node 1 with 0. Then 37 can't be 0, and 14 can't be 0. Node 14 is connected to 8 and 1. 8 is connected to 14, 23, 38. Let's color 14 with 1. Then 8 can't be 1. Let's color 8 with 0. Then 23 is connected to 8, 24, 3. 23 can't be 0. Let's color 23 with 1. Then 24 is connected to 23, 3, 18. 24 can't be 1. Let's color 24 with 0. 3 is connected to 21, 24, 23. 3 can't be 0 (from 24) or 1 (from 23). So 3 must be 2. Then 21 is connected to 3, 19, 25. 21 can't be 2. Let's color 21 with 0. 19 is connected to 21, 33, 26, 4, 40. 19 can't be 0. Let's color 19 with 1. Then 33 is connected to 19, 30, 5. 33 can't be 1. Let's color 33 with 0. 30 is connected to 33, so 30 can't be 0. Let's color 30 with 1. 5 is connected to 33, 28. 5 can't be 0. Let's color 5 with 1. 28 is connected to 5, 13, 17. 28 can't be 1. Let's color 28 with 0. 13 is connected to 28, 20. 13 can't be 0. Let's color 13 with 1. 20 is connected to 13, 26. 20 can't be 1. Let's color 20 with 0. 26 is connected to 20, 7, 14, 19, 29. 26 can't be 0 (20), 1 (14), 1 (19). Wait, 20 is 0, 14 is 1, 19 is 1. So 26 can't be 0 or 1. So 26 must be 2. Then 7 is connected to 26, 37. 7 can't be 2. Let's color 7 with 0. 37 is connected to 10, 1, 7, 18, 6. 1 is 0, 7 is 0. So 37 can't be 0. Let's color 37 with 1. 10 is connected to 37, 18. 37 is 1, so 10 can't be 1. Let's color 10 with 0. 18 is connected to 37, 24. 37 is 1, 24 is 0. So 18 can't be 1 or 0. 18 must be 2. 6 is connected to 37, 17. 37 is 1, so 6 can't be 1. Let's color 6 with 0. 17 is connected to 6, 28. 6 is 0, 28 is 0. So 17 can't be 0. Let's color 17 with 1. \n\nNode 4 is connected to 27, 42, 19. 19 is 1, so 4 can't be 1. Let's color 4 with 0. 27 is connected to 4, 34. 4 is 0, so 27 can't be 0. Let's color 27 with 1. 34 is connected to 27, 22, 11. 27 is 1, so 34 can't be 1. Let's color 34 with 0. 22 is connected to 34, 39. 34 is 0, so 22 can't be 0. Let's color 22 with 1. 39 is connected to 22, 29. 22 is 1, so 39 can't be 1. Let's color 39 with 0. 29 is connected to 26, 39. 26 is 2, 39 is 0. So 29 can't be 2 or 0. 29 must be 1. \n\nNode 25 is connected to 21, 36. 21 is 0, so 25 can't be 0. Let's color 25 with 1. 36 is connected to 25, so 36 can't be 1. Let's color 36 with 0. \n\nNode 11 is connected to 34, 12. 34 is 0, so 11 can't be 0. Let's color 11 with 1. 12 is connected to 11, so 12 can't be 1. Let's color 12 with 0. \n\nNode 40 is connected to 19. 19 is 1, so 40 can't be 1. Let's color 40 with 0. \n\nNode 38 is connected to 8. 8 is 0, so 38 can't be 0. Let's color 38 with 1. \n\nNode 42 is connected to 4. 4 is 0, so 42 can't be 0. Let's color 42 with 1. \n\nNow, let's check if any nodes are missing. Nodes 2, let's check if it's connected to anyone. The edges given don't mention node 2. So node 2 is isolated. We can color it with any color, say 0.\n\nLet me list all nodes and their colors so far:\n\n0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:2, 4:0, 5:1, 6:0, 7:0, 8:0, 9:1, 10:0, 11:1, 12:0, 13:1, 14:1, 15:? (Is 15 connected to anyone? Edges don't mention 15, so it's isolated. Color 0), 16:? (Edges: 16-35. So 16 is connected to 35. Let's handle 16 and 35. 16 and 35 are connected. Let's color 16 with 0, then 35 can't be 0. Let's color 35 with 1. 17:1, 18:2, 19:1, 20:0, 21:0, 22:1, 23:1, 24:0, 25:1, 26:2, 27:1, 28:0, 29:1, 30:1, 31:? (Isolated, color 0), 32:0, 33:0, 34:0, 35:1, 36:0, 37:1, 38:1, 39:0, 40:0, 41:? (Isolated, color 0), 42:1.\n\nWait, let's check all edges again to make sure no conflicts:\n\nCheck 10-37: 10 is 0, 37 is 1. Good.\n\n1-37: 1 is 0, 37 is 1. Good.\n\n16-35: 16 is 0, 35 is 1.

Let's list out all the edges to see the connections:\n\nEdges:\n8-43, 0-39, 6-30, 16-38, 29-32, 4-24, 12-25, 7-44, 21-43, 3-31, 8-21, 4-30, 10-18, 4-36, 17-33, 0-23, 10-21, 1-15, 0-32, 10-36, 2-35, 1-42, 5-6, 16-37, 14-15, 20-31, 1-11, 3-36, 1-23, 24-28, 8-44, 11-37, 16-27, 0-43, 25-39, 6-31, 6-37, 7-42, 21-35, 31-39, 5-23, 5-20, 9-18, 23-41, 28-34, 2-24\n\nFirst, let's check the degree of each node to see if there are any high-degree nodes. For example, node 0 is connected to 39, 23, 32, 43. So degree 4. Node 1 is connected to 15, 42, 11, 23. Degree 4. Node 4 is connected to 24, 30, 36. Degree 3. Node 6 is connected to 30, 5, 31, 37. Degree 4. Node 8 is connected to 43, 21, 44. Degree 3. Node 10 is connected to 18, 21, 36. Degree 3. Node 21 is connected to 43, 8, 10, 35. Degree 4. Node 23 is connected to 0, 1, 5, 41. Degree 4. Node 31 is connected to 3, 20, 6, 39. Degree 4. Node 36 is connected to 4, 10, 3. Degree 3. Node 39 is connected to 0, 25, 31. Degree 3. \n\nSince the problem states that 3 colors are sufficient, the graph must be 3-colorable. Let's start by choosing a node and assigning a color, then proceed to its neighbors. Let's start with node 0. Let's assign color 0 to node 0. Then its neighbors (39, 23, 32, 43) must be colored with 1 or 2. Let's pick node 39: neighbor of 0. 39 is also connected to 25 and 31. Let's color 39 with 1. Then node 25 (connected to 39) can't be 1. 25 is also connected to 12, so 25's color is 0 or 2. Let's say 25 is 0. Node 31 is connected to 39 (color 1), 3, 20, 6. 31 can't be 1, so 0 or 2. Let's color 31 with 2. Then node 3 (connected to 31) can't be 2. 3 is also connected to 36, so 3's color is 0 or 1. Let's say 3 is 0. Node 20 is connected to 31 (2), 5. 20 can be 0 or 1. Let's say 20 is 0. Then node 5 (connected to 20) can't be 0. 5 is connected to 6 and 23. Let's color 5 with 1. Node 6 is connected to 5 (1), 30, 31 (2), 37. So 6 can't be 1 or 2, so 6 must be 0. Node 30 is connected to 6 (0), 4. 30 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 30 is 1. Node 4 is connected to 30 (1), 24, 36. 4 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 4 is 0. Node 24 is connected to 4 (0), 28, 2. 24 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 24 is 1. Node 28 is connected to 24 (1), 34. 28 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 28 is 0. Node 34 is connected to 28 (0), so 34 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 34 is 1. Node 2 is connected to 24 (1), 35. 2 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 2 is 0. Node 35 is connected to 2 (0), 21. 35 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 35 is 1. Node 21 is connected to 35 (1), 8, 10, 43. 21 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 21 is 0. Node 8 is connected to 21 (0), 43, 44. 8 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 8 is 1. Node 43 is connected to 8 (1), 21 (0), 0 (0). 43 can't be 0 or 1, so 43 must be 2. Node 44 is connected to 8 (1), 7. 44 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 44 is 0. Node 7 is connected to 44 (0), 42. 7 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 7 is 1. Node 42 is connected to 7 (1), 1. 42 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 42 is 0. Node 1 is connected to 42 (0), 15, 11, 23. 1 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 1 is 1. Node 15 is connected to 1 (1), 14. 15 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 15 is 0. Node 14 is connected to 15 (0), so 14 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 14 is 1. Node 11 is connected to 1 (1), 37. 11 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 11 is 0. Node 37 is connected to 11 (0), 16, 6 (0). 37 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 37 is 1. Node 16 is connected to 37 (1), 38, 27. 16 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 16 is 0. Node 38 is connected to 16 (0), so 38 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 38 is 1. Node 27 is connected to 16 (0), so 27 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 27 is 1. Node 23 is connected to 0 (0), 1 (1), 5 (1), 41. 23 can't be 0 or 1, so 23 must be 2. Node 41 is connected to 23 (2), so 41 can be 0 or 1. Let's say 41 is 0. Node 10 is connected to 21 (0), 18, 36. 10 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 10 is 1. Node 18 is connected to 10 (1), 9. 18 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 18 is 0. Node 9 is connected to 18 (0), so 9 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 9 is 1. Node 36 is connected to 4 (0), 10 (1), 3 (0). 36 can't be 0 or 1, so 36 must be 2. \n\nLet's check for any conflicts. Let's verify some nodes:\n\n- Node 0 (0): neighbors 39 (1), 23 (2), 32 (needs color), 43 (2). Wait, I didn't color node 32 yet. Node 32 is connected to 0 (0) and 29. 32 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 32 is 1. Then node 29 is connected to 32 (1), so 29 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 29 is 0. \n\nCheck node 23 (2): neighbors 0 (0), 1 (1), 5 (1), 41 (0).

So 12 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 12 is 1.\n\nNode 25 (0): neighbors 12 (1), 39 (1). All different, good.\n\nNode 32 (1): neighbors 0 (0), 29 (0). All different, good.\n\nNode 29 (0): neighbors 32 (1). Good.\n\nWhat about node 17? It's connected to 33. I missed them. Node 17: connected to 33. Let's color 17 with 0, 33 with 1. No conflicts.\n\nNode 17 (0), 33 (1). Check: 17's neighbor 33 (1) is different. Good.\n\nNode 33 (1): neighbor 17 (0). Good.\n\nNow, let's list all nodes and their colors:\n\n0:0\n\n1:1\n\n2:0\n\n3:0\n\n4:0\n\n5:1\n\n6:0\n\n7:1\n\n8:1\n\n9:1\n\n10:1\n\n11:0\n\n12:1\n\n13:? Wait, node 13 isn't in any edges. Oh right, the edges list might not include all nodes. So node 13 is an isolated node. We can color it with any color, say 0.\n\n14:1\n\n15:0\n\n16:0\n\n17:0\n\n18:0\n\n19:? Also not in edges. Isolated. Color 0.\n\n20:0\n\n21:0\n\n22:? Isolated. Color 0.\n\n23:2\n\n24:1\n\n25:0\n\n26:? Isolated.

Let's list all 45 nodes (0-44) and assign colors, ensuring isolated nodes are colored (they can be any color as they have no edges).

Then 7 (connected to 5) can't be 1. 7 is also connected to 28. Let's color 7 as 0. Then 28 is connected to 7 (0), 9, 15, 6, 17. 28 can't be 0. Let's say 28 is 1. Then 9 (connected to 28) can't be 1. 9 is also connected to 16. Let's color 9 as 0. Then 16 is connected to 9 (0), 20, 3. 16 can't be 0. Let's color 16 as 1. 20 is connected to 16 (1) and 13. 20 can't be 1. Let's color 20 as 0. 13 is connected to 20 (0) and 26. 13 can't be 0. Let's color 13 as 1. 26 (connected to 13) can't be 1. So 26 is 0 or 2. Let's color 26 as 0.\n\nBack to 15: connected to 5 (1), 12, 22 (1), 28 (1). So 15 can't be 1. Let's color 15 as 0. Then 12 is connected to 15 (0), 5 (1), 19, 25. 12 can't be 0 or 1. So 12 must be 2. 19 is connected to 12 (2), so 19 can't be 2. Let's color 19 as 0. 25 is connected to 12 (2) and 29. 25 can't be 2. Let's color 25 as 0. 29 is connected to 25 (0), so 29 can't be 0. Let's color 29 as 1.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 24 and 28 (1). 28 is 1, so 6 can't be 1. Let's color 6 as 0. 24 is connected to 6 (0), 4, 11. 24 can't be 0. Let's color 24 as 1. 4 is connected to 24 (1), so 4 can't be 1. Let's color 4 as 0. 11 is connected to 24 (1) and 17. 11 can't be 1. Let's color 11 as 0. 17 is connected to 11 (0), 8, 28 (1). 17 can't be 0 or 1. So 17 must be 2. 8 is connected to 17 (2) and 23. 8 can't be 2. Let's color 8 as 0. 23 is connected to 8 (0), so 23 can't be 0. Let's color 23 as 1.\n\nNow, let's check if all nodes are colored:\n\n0:0, 2:1, 30:1, 5:1, 7:0, 28:1, 9:0, 16:1, 20:0, 13:1, 26:0, 15:0, 12:2, 19:0, 25:0, 29:1, 6:0, 24:1, 4:0, 11:0, 17:2, 8:0, 23:1, 18:0, 22:1, 10:0.\n\nWait, what about node 1? Oh right, node 1 isn't connected to any other node in the edges list. So node 1 is an isolated node. So we can color it with any color, say 0.\n\nLet me list all nodes and their colors:\n\n0:0\n\n1:0 (since it's isolated)\n\n2:1\n\n3:? Wait, node 3 is connected to 16 (1). 3 is only connected to 16 (1). So 3 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 3 as 0.\n\n4:0\n\n5:1\n\n6:0\n\n7:0\n\n8:0\n\n9:0\n\n10:0\n\n11:0\n\n12:2\n\n13:1\n\n14:?

Color 27 as 0.\n\n28:1\n\n29:1\n\n30:1\n\nWait, let's check for conflicts:\n\nCheck node 0: neighbors 30 (1), 2 (1), 5 (1). 0 is 0. No conflict.\n\nNode 2: neighbors 0 (0), 18 (0). 2 is 1.

Good.\n\nNode 1: isolated, 0. No conflicts.\n\nThis seems to work. All connected nodes have different colors. The isolated nodes (1,14,21,27) can be colored with 0, which is allowed.

Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 29 is connected to 38. Let's color 29 with 0, 38 with 1.\n\nNode 30 is connected to 13 (0), so 30 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 8 is connected to 21. Let's color 8 with 0, 21 with 1.\n\nIsolated nodes (7, 11, 12, 16, 25, 31) can be colored with 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2 respectively, but since they are isolated, any color is fine. Let's just assign 0 to all for simplicity, but maybe check if that's okay. Wait, no, they have no edges, so any color is allowed. Let's assign 0 to 7, 1 to 11, 2 to 12, 0 to 16, 1 to 25, 2 to 31.\n\nNow let's check for conflicts:\n\nCheck node 0 (0): neighbors 41(1), 4(1), 46(1) – no conflict.\n\nNode 1 (0): neighbors 20(1), 10(1), 22(2) – no conflict.\n\nNode 2 (0): neighbors 33(1), 32(2), 18(1) – no conflict.\n\nNode 3 (0): neighbors 40(1), 5(1) – no conflict.\n\nNode 4 (1): neighbors 45(2), 26(0), 0(0) – no conflict.\n\nNode 5 (1): neighbors 15(0), 3(0) – no conflict.\n\nNode 6 (0): neighbors 35(1), 43(1), 9(1) – no conflict.\n\nNode 7 (0): no neighbors – okay.\n\nNode 8 (0): neighbor 21(1) – okay.\n\nNode 9 (1): neighbors 13(0), 28(0), 6(0) – no conflict.\n\nNode 10 (1): neighbor 1(0) – okay.\n\nNode 11 (1): no neighbors – okay.\n\nNode 12 (2): no neighbors – okay.\n\nNode 13 (0): neighbors 30(1), 39(1), 47(2), 9(1) – no conflict.\n\nNode 14 (0): neighbors 37(1), 44(1) – okay.\n\nNode 15 (0): neighbor 5(1) – okay.\n\nNode 16 (0): no neighbors – okay.\n\nNode 17 (0): neighbors 39(1), 45(2), 41(1) – no conflict.\n\nNode 18 (1): neighbors 34(0), 24(0), 2(0) – no conflict.\n\nNode 19 (0): neighbors 46(1), 39(1) – no conflict.\n\nNode 20 (1): neighbor 1(0) – okay.\n\nNode 21 (1): neighbor 8(0) – okay.\n\nNode 22 (2): neighbors 33(1), 1(0) – no conflict.\n\nNode 23 (0): neighbors 40(1), 32(2), 41(1) – no conflict.\n\nNode 24 (0): neighbor 18(1) – okay.\n\nNode 25 (1): no neighbors – okay.\n\nNode 26 (0): neighbors 32(2), 4(1) – no conflict.\n\nNode 27 (0): neighbors 47(2), 45(2) – no conflict.\n\nNode 28 (0): neighbors 33(1), 41(1), 9(1) – no conflict.\n\nNode 29 (0): neighbor 38(1) – okay.\n\nNode 30 (1): neighbor 13(0) – okay.\n\nNode 31 (2): no neighbors – okay.\n\nNode 32 (2): neighbors 26(0), 2(0), 23(0), 41(1) – no conflict.\n\nNode 33 (1): neighbors 2(0), 28(0), 22(2) – no conflict.\n\nNode 34 (0): neighbor 18(1) – okay.\n\nNode 35 (1): neighbor 6(0) – okay.\n\nNode 36 (0): neighbors 37(1), 45(2) – no conflict.\n\nNode 37 (1): neighbors 14(0), 36(0) – no conflict.\n\nNode 38 (1): neighbor 29(0) – okay.\n\nNode 39 (1): neighbors 13(0), 42(0), 17(0), 19(0) – no conflict.\n\nNode 40 (1): neighbors 47(2), 23(0), 3(0) – no conflict.\n\nNode 41 (1): neighbors 0(0), 17(0), 28(0), 32(2), 23(0) – no conflict.\n\nNode 42 (0): neighbor 39(1) – okay.\n\nNode 43 (1): neighbor 6(0) – okay.\n\nNode 44 (1): neighbor 14(0) – okay.\n\nNode 45 (2): neighbors 4(1), 17(0), 36(0), 27(0) – no conflict.\n\nNode 46 (1): neighbors 19(0), 0(0) – no conflict.\n\nNode 47 (2): neighbors 27(0), 40(1), 13(0) – no conflict.\n\nLooks like all nodes are colored with 0, 1, 2 and no adjacent nodes share the same color. The isolated nodes are colored with 0,1,2,0,1,2 but since they have no edges, it's fine.

Their neighbors: none, so they can take any color.\n\nSince the graph is 3-colorable (assuming it's not containing a K4, which it doesn't since max degree is 4, but 3-colorable might be possible), let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet's start with node 0. It's connected to 15. Let's color 0 with 0. Then 15 can't be 0. Let's pick 1 for 15.\n\nNode 15 is connected to 27, 36, 5, 0. So 27, 36, 5 can't be 1. Let's handle 5: 5 is connected to 7, 15, 33. 15 is 1, so 5 can be 0 or 2. Let's choose 0 for 5. Then 7 (connected to 5) can't be 0. 7 is also connected to 47. Let's leave 7 for later.\n\nNode 36 is connected to 15 (1) and 22. So 36 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0 for 36. Then 22 (connected to 36) can't be 0. 22 is also connected to 20 and 11. 20 is connected only to 22, so 20 can be 0 (since 22 can't be 0). Let's color 20 with 0. Then 22 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1 for 22. Then 11 (connected to 22) can't be 1. 11 is connected to 27. Let's note 27's neighbors: 15 (1), 33, 48, 11. So 27 can't be 1. Let's handle 27 later.\n\nNode 22 is 1, so 20 is 0 (good). 11 is connected to 22 (1), so 11 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 0. Then 27 (connected to 11 (0)) can't be 0. 27 is connected to 15 (1), so 27 can be 2. Let's set 27 to 2. Then 33 (connected to 27 (2)) can't be 2. 33 is connected to 5 (0), 47, 46. 5 is 0, so 33 can be 1 or 2, but 27 is 2, so 33 can be 1. Let's set 33 to 1. Then 47 (connected to 33 (1)) can't be 1. 47 is connected to 7, 19, 1. 7 is connected to 5 (0), so 7 can be 1 or 2. 47 is connected to 7, 19, 1. Let's see 1: 1 is connected to 9, 32, 47. Let's handle 1. 1 can be 0, 2 (since 47 is connected to 1, but 47's color is not set yet). Maybe 1: let's color 1 with 0. Then 47 (connected to 1 (0)) can't be 0. 47 is connected to 33 (1), so 47 can be 2. Let's set 47 to 2. Then 7 (connected to 47 (2)) can't be 2. 7 is connected to 5 (0), so 7 can be 1. So 7 is 1.\n\nNow 47 is 2. 19 is connected to 46 and 47 (2). So 19 can't be 2. 19's color can be 0 or 1. Let's see 46: 46 is connected to 19, 34, 33 (1), 6. 33 is 1, so 46 can't be 1. 46 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 46 as 0. Then 19 (connected to 46 (0)) can't be 0. 19 is connected to 47 (2), so 19 can be 1. So 19 is 1. 34 is connected to 46 (0), so 34 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 34 to 1. 6 is connected to 46 (0) and 16. 6 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 6 to 1. 16 is connected to 44, 40, 6 (1). So 16 can't be 1. 16 can be 0 or 2. Let's set 16 to 0. Then 40 (connected to 16 (0)) can be 1 or 2. Let's set 40 to 1.\n\nNow 44 is connected to 29, 16 (0), 10, 23. 16 is 0, so 44 can't be 0. 44 can be 1 or 2. Let's see 29: 29 is connected to 44, 26, 8. 29's color depends on 44. 10 is connected to 37, 44, 4. 23 is connected to 2, 24, 4, 44. Let's handle 23. 23 is connected to 44 (let's say 44 is 1), 2, 24, 4. If 44 is 1, 23 can't be 1. 23 can be 0 or 2. Let's set 44 to 1. Then 23 can be 0. 23 is 0. Then 2 (connected to 23 (0)) can't be 0. 2 is connected to 37. 2 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 2 to 1. 24 is connected to 23 (0) and 14. 24 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 24 to 1. 14 is connected to 24 (1) and 39. 14 can be 0 or 2. Let's set 14 to 0. 39 is connected to 14 (0), 21, 43. 39 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 39 to 1. 21 is connected to 39 (1), so 21 can be 0 or 2. Let's set 21 to 0. 43 is connected to 18, 9, 39 (1). 43 can't be 1. 43 can be 0 or 2. Let's set 43 to 0. 18 is connected to 31 and 43 (0). 18 can't be 0. 18 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 18 to 1. 31 is connected to 18 (1) and 9. 31 can't be 1. 31 can be 0 or 2. Let's set 31 to 0. 9 is connected to 1 (0), 31 (0), 43 (0), 30. 9 is connected to 1 (0), 31 (0), 43 (0), so 9 can't be 0. 9 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 9 to 1. 30 is connected to 9 (1) and 48. 30 can't be 1. 30 can be 0 or 2. Let's set 30 to 0. 48 is connected to 30 (0) and 27 (2). 48 can't be 0 or 2. Wait, 27 is 2, 30 is 0. So 48 can be 1. That works. So 48 is 1.\n\nNow 10 is connected to 37, 44 (1), 4. 10 can't be 1. 10 can be 0 or 2. Let's set 10 to 0. 4 is connected to 23 (0) and 10 (0). 4 can't be 0. 4 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 4 to 1. 37 is connected to 10 (0), 25, 38, 2 (1). 37 can't be 0 or 1. So 37 must be 2. 25 is connected to 37 (2) and 49. 25 can't be 2. 25 can be 0 or 1. Let's set 25 to 0. 49 is connected to 25 (0), so 49 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 49 to 1. 38 is connected to 37 (2) and 42. 38 can't be 2. 38 can be 0 or 1. Let's set 38 to 0. 42 is connected to 38 (0) and 28. 42 can't be 0. 42 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 42 to 1. 28 is connected to 42 (1), so 28 can be 0 or 2. Let's set 28 to 0.\n\nBack to 29: 29 is connected to 44 (1), 26, 8. 29 can't be 1. 29 can be 0 or 2. Let's set 29 to 0. 26 is connected to 29 (0), so 26 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 26 to 1. 8 is connected to 29 (0), so 8 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 8 to 1.\n\n32 is connected to 1 (0), so 32 can be 1 or 2. Let's set 32 to 1.\n\nNow, check isolated nodes: 3,12,13,35,41. Let's assign them colors 0,1,2,0,1 (to use all 3 colors). So 3:0, 12:1, 13:2, 35:0, 41:1.\n\nLet's verify some connections:\n\n- 0 (0) connected to 15 (1) → ok.\n- 1 (0) connected to 9 (1), 32 (1), 47 (2) → ok.\n- 2 (1) connected to 23 (0), 37 (2) → ok.\n- 3 (0) → no edges, ok.\n- 4 (1) connected to 23 (0), 10 (0) → ok.\n- 5 (0) connected to 7 (1), 15 (1), 33 (1) → ok.\n- 6 (1) connected to 16 (0), 46 (0) → ok.\n- 7 (1) connected to 5 (0), 47 (2) → ok.\n- 8 (1) connected to 29 (0) → ok.\n- 9 (1) connected to 1 (0), 31 (0), 43 (0), 30 (0) → ok.\n- 10 (0) connected to 37 (2), 44 (1), 4 (1) → ok.\n- 11 (0) connected to 22 (1), 27 (2) → ok.\n- 12 (1) → ok.\n- 13 (2) → ok.\n- 14 (0) connected to 24 (1), 39 (1) → ok.\n- 15 (1) connected to 27 (2), 36 (0), 5 (0), 0 (0) → ok.\n- 16 (0) connected to 44 (1), 40 (1), 6 (1) → ok.\n- 17 (?) Let's check 17: connected to 45. 17 and 45 are connected. 17 hasn't been colored yet. Oh right, I missed 17 and 45. Let's handle them. 17 is connected to 45. Let's color 17 with 0, 45 with 1 (since they are connected). So 17:0, 45:1.\n- 18 (1) connected to 31 (0), 43 (0) → ok.\n- 19 (1) connected to 46 (0), 47 (2) → ok.\n- 20 (0) connected to 22 (1) → ok.\n- 21 (0) connected to 39 (1) → ok.\n- 22 (1) connected to 20 (0), 11 (0), 36 (0) → ok.\n- 23 (0) connected to 2 (1), 24 (1), 4 (1), 44 (1) → ok.\n- 24 (1) connected to 23 (0), 14 (0) → ok.\n- 25 (0) connected to 37 (2), 49 (1) → ok.\n- 26 (1) connected to 29 (0) → ok.\n- 27 (2) connected to 15 (1), 33 (1), 48 (1), 11 (0) → ok.\n- 28 (0) connected to 42 (1) → ok.\n- 29 (0) connected to 44 (1), 26 (1), 8 (1) → ok.\n- 30 (0) connected to 48 (1), 9 (1) → ok.\n- 31 (0) connected to 18 (1), 9 (1) → ok.\n- 32 (1) connected to 1 (0) → ok.\n- 33 (1) connected to 47 (2), 5 (0), 27 (2), 46 (0) → ok.\n- 34 (1) connected to 46 (0) → ok.\n- 35 (0) → ok.\n- 36 (0) connected to 15 (1), 22 (1) → ok.\n- 37 (2) connected to 10 (0), 25 (0), 38 (0), 2 (1) → ok.\n- 38 (0) connected to 37 (2), 42 (1) → ok.\n- 39 (1) connected to 21 (0), 14 (0), 43 (0) → ok.\n- 40 (1) connected to 16 (0) → ok.\n- 41 (1) → ok.\n- 42 (1) connected to 28 (0), 38 (0) → ok.\n- 43 (0) connected to 18 (1), 9 (1), 39 (1) → ok.\n- 44 (1) connected to 29 (0), 16 (0), 10 (0), 23 (0) → ok.\n- 45 (1) connected to 17 (0) → ok.\n- 46 (0) connected to 19 (1), 34 (1), 33 (1), 6 (1) → ok.\n- 47 (2) connected to 7 (1), 33 (1), 19 (1), 1 (0) → ok.\n- 48 (1) connected to 30 (0), 27 (2) → ok.\n- 49 (1) connected to 25 (0) → ok.\n\nAll connections seem to have different colors. Let's list all nodes:\n\n0:0, 1:0, 2:1, 3:0, 4:1, 5:0, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:0, 11:0, 12:1, 13:2, 14:0, 15:1, 16:0, 17:0, 18:1, 19:1, 20:0, 21:0, 22:1, 23:0, 24:1, 25:0, 26:1, 27:2, 28:0, 29:0, 30:0, 31:0, 32:1, 33:1, 34:1, 35:0, 36:0, 37:2, 38:0, 39:1, 40:1, 41:1, 42:1, 43:0, 44:1, 45:1, 46:0, 47:2, 48:1, 49:1.\n\nWait, node 13 is 2, which is good. Let's check if all 3 colors are used (0,1,2). Yes, 13 is 2, 27 is 2, 37 is 2, 47 is 2. So that's covered.\n\nI think this works. Let's compile the list.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 0], [4, 1], [5, 0], [6, 1], [7, 1], [8, 1], [9, 1], [10, 0], [11, 0], [12, 1], [13, 2], [14, 0], [15, 1], [16, 0], [17, 0], [18, 1], [19, 1], [20, 0], [21, 0], [22, 1], [23, 0], [24, 1], [25, 0], [26, 1], [27, 2], [28, 0], [29, 0], [30, 0], [31, 0], [32, 1], [33, 1], [34, 1], [35, 0], [36, 0], [37, 2], [38, 0], [39, 1], [40, 1], [41, 1], [42, 1], [43, 0], [44, 1], [45, 1], [46, 0], [47, 2], [48, 1], [49, 1]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

First, I need to list all the nodes and their edges to see the connections. The nodes are 0-22, so 23 nodes. Let's start by building an adjacency list to understand the graph structure better.\n\nLet me list out all the edges:\n\n12-16, 3-13, 0-5, 8-21, 2-11, 10-18, 2-14, 0-20, 6-20, 12-18, 9-10, 11-13, 11-22, 6-7, 15-19, 12-20, 0-3, 0-12, 9-21, 8-13, 9-18, 8-22, 0-18, 1-22.\n\nLet me create adjacency lists for each node:\n\n0: connected to 5, 20, 3, 12, 18 (since 0-5, 0-20, 0-3, 0-12, 0-18)\n1: connected to 22 (1-22)\n2: connected to 11, 14 (2-11, 2-14)\n3: connected to 13, 0 (3-13, 0-3)\n4: Hmm, I don't see any edges with 4. Wait, the edges list doesn't include 4. So node 4 is isolated?\n5: connected to 0 (0-5)\n6: connected to 20, 7 (6-20, 6-7)\n7: connected to 6 (6-7)\n8: connected to 21, 13, 22 (8-21, 8-13, 8-22)\n9: connected to 10, 21, 18 (9-10, 9-21, 9-18)\n10: connected to 18, 9 (10-18, 9-10)\n11: connected to 2, 13, 22 (2-11, 11-13, 11-22)\n12: connected to 16, 18, 20, 0 (12-16, 12-18, 12-20, 0-12)\n13: connected to 3, 11, 8 (3-13, 11-13, 8-13)\n14: connected to 2 (2-14)\n15: connected to 19 (15-19)\n16: connected to 12 (12-16)\n17: Wait, edges don't mention 17.

Let's note that.\n\nNow, let's look for high-degree nodes to color first, as they might have more constraints. Let's check node 0: connected to 5,20,3,12,18. That's 5 neighbors. Node 12: connected to 16,18,20,0 (4 neighbors). Node 18: connected to 10,12,9,0 (4 neighbors). Node 22: connected to 11,8,1 (3 neighbors). Node 11: connected to 2,13,22 (3). Node 8: connected to 21,13,22 (3). Node 9: connected to 10,21,18 (3). Node 20: connected to 0,6,12 (3). Node 3: connected to 13,0 (2). Node 5: connected to 0 (1). Node 6: connected to 20,7 (2). Node 7: connected to 6 (1). Node 10: connected to 18,9 (2). Node 13: connected to 3,11,8 (3). Node 2: connected to 11,14 (2). Node 14: connected to 2 (1). Node 15: connected to 19 (1). Node 16: connected to 12 (1). Node 19: connected to 15 (1). Nodes 1,4,17: node 1 connected to 22 (1), 4 and 17 isolated.\n\nLet's start with node 0. Let's assign color 0 to node 0. Then its neighbors (5,20,3,12,18) can't be 0.\n\nNeighbor 5: can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNeighbor 20: can't be 0. Let's check 20's neighbors: 0 (0), 6, 12. So 20's color can't be 0. Let's assign 20 color 1. Then 6 (connected to 20) can't be 1. 6's other neighbor is 7. So 6 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0 for 6. Then 7 (connected to 6) can't be 0, so 7 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNeighbor 3 (connected to 0): can't be 0. 3's other neighbor is 13. So 3 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 3 color 1. Then 13 (connected to 3) can't be 1. 13's other neighbors: 11,8. So 13 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0 for 13.\n\nNeighbor 12 (connected to 0): can't be 0. 12's neighbors: 16, 18, 20, 0. 20 is 1, 0 is 0. So 12 can be 2 (since 0 and 1 are taken by 0 and 20). Let's assign 12 color 2. Then 16 (connected to 12) can't be 2. 16 has no other neighbors, so 16 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNeighbor 18 (connected to 0): can't be 0. 18's neighbors: 10,12,9,0. 12 is 2, 0 is 0. So 18 can be 1. Let's assign 18 color 1. Then 10 (connected to 18) can't be 1. 10's other neighbor is 9. So 10 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. Then 9 (connected to 10) can't be 0. 9's other neighbors: 21,18. 18 is 1, so 9 can be 2. Assign 9 color 2. 21 (connected to 9) can't be 2. 21's other neighbor is 8. So 21 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0. 8 (connected to 21) can't be 0. 8's other neighbors: 13,22. 13 is 0, so 8 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. 22 (connected to 8) can't be 1. 22's other neighbors: 11,1. 11's color: 11 is connected to 2,13,22. 13 is 0. So 11 can't be 0 (since 13 is 0). Let's see 11's neighbors: 2 (unknown), 13 (0), 22 (unknown). Let's first assign 2. 2 is connected to 11,14. 14 is connected only to 2. So 2 can be 0 (since 11 is not yet assigned). Let's assign 2 color 0. Then 14 (connected to 2) can't be 0, so 14 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Now 11 is connected to 2 (0) and 13 (0). So 11 can't be 0. 11 is also connected to 22. So 11 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Then 22 (connected to 11) can't be 1. 22 is connected to 8 (1) and 1. So 22 can't be 1. 8 is 1, 11 is 1, so 22 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 2. Then 1 (connected to 22) can't be 2. 1 has no other neighbors, so 1 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNow let's recap the assignments so far:\n\n0: 0\n\n1: 0 (connected to 22:2)\n\n2: 0 (connected to 11:1, 14:1)\n\n3: 1 (connected to 0:0, 13:0)\n\n4: ? (isolated, can be 0,1,2. Let's pick 0)\n\n5: 1 (connected to 0:0)\n\n6: 0 (connected to 20:1, 7:1)\n\n7: 1 (connected to 6:0)\n\n8: 1 (connected to 21:0, 13:0, 22:2)\n\n9: 2 (connected to 10:0, 21:0, 18:1)\n\n10: 0 (connected to 18:1, 9:2)\n\n11: 1 (connected to 2:0, 13:0, 22:2)\n\n12: 2 (connected to 16:0, 18:1, 20:1, 0:0)\n\n13: 0 (connected to 3:1, 11:1, 8:1)\n\n14: 1 (connected to 2:0)\n\n15: ? (connected to 19)\n\n16: 0 (connected to 12:2)\n\n17: ? (isolated, can be 0,1,2. Let's pick 1)\n\n18: 1 (connected to 10:0, 12:2, 9:2, 0:0)\n\n19: ? (connected to 15)\n\n20: 1 (connected to 0:0, 6:0, 12:2)\n\n21: 0 (connected to 8:1, 9:2)\n\n22: 2 (connected to 11:1, 8:1, 1:0)\n\nNow, check 15 and 19. They are connected to each other (15-19). So they need different colors. Let's assign 15 color 0, then 19 can't be 0. 19 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. So 15:0, 19:1.\n\nCheck node 4: isolated, assign 0.\n\nNode 17: isolated, assign 1.\n\nNow let's check all nodes for conflicts:\n\n0 (0) neighbors:5(1),20(1),3(1),12(2),18(1) – all different from 0.

First, I need to understand the structure of the graph. Let's list all the nodes and their connections. The nodes are 0 to 38, and there are various edges. Since it's a 3-coloring problem, each node must be colored with 0, 1, or 2 such that no adjacent nodes share the same color.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look for cliques (groups of nodes where each is connected to every other) because they require distinct colors. The maximum clique size would determine the minimum number of colors needed. Let's check if there's a clique of size 3, which would mean 3 colors are necessary.\n\nLooking at the edges, let's see if any three nodes are all connected. For example, node 33 is connected to 2, 6, 8, 19, 27, 30. Let's check if 2, 6, 8 are all connected to each other. 2-33, 6-33, 8-33, but do 2-6, 2-8, 6-8 have edges? The edges list: 2-33, 6-33, 8-33, but 2-6? No. 2-8? No. 6-8? No. So 33's neighbors might not form a clique.\n\nAnother node: 29 is connected to 18, 6, 15, 19, 3. Let's check 6, 15, 19. 6-29, 15-29, 19-29. Do 6-15? 4-15, 14-15, 15-29, 15-18. No 6-15. 6-19? 6-26, 6-33, 6-29. 19-33, 19-29, 10-19. No 6-19. 15-19? 15-29, 19-29. No 15-19. So 29's neighbors also not a clique.\n\nNode 12: connected to 28, 37, 3, 7. 28-12, 37-12, 3-12, 7-12. 28-37? 10-37, 12-37, 13-37, 37-38. No 28-37. 28-3? 11-28, 1-28, 12-28. No 28-3. 37-3? 3-12, 3-26, 3-29. No 37-3. 3-7? 3-12, 7-12, 7-20. No 3-7. So 12's neighbors not a clique.\n\nMaybe a triangle (3-clique) exists. Let's check edges: 15 is connected to 4, 14, 29, 18. 14-15, 14-9. 9-14, 9-32, 9-2. 2-9, 2-33. 18-15, 18-29. 29-18, 29-6, 29-19, 29-3. 3-29, 3-26, 3-12. 6-29, 6-33, 6-26. 26-6, 26-1, 26-3. 1-26, 1-28. 28-1, 28-12, 28-11. 11-28, 11-38. 38-11, 38-24, 38-37. 37-38, 37-10, 37-12, 37-13. 13-37, 13-31, 13-8. 8-13, 8-33. 33-8, 33-2, 33-6, 33-19, 33-27, 33-30. 19-33, 19-29, 19-10. 10-19, 10-37, 10-4. 4-10, 4-15. 20-16, 20-7, 20-21. 21-20, 21-30. 30-21, 30-33. 27-33. 31-13. 34-36. 17-22. 0-5.\n\nLooking for any three nodes where each is connected to the other two. Let's check 3, 26, 6. 3-26 (yes), 3-6? No. 26-6 (yes). 3-26-6, but 3 and 6 not connected. 3, 29, 19: 3-29 (yes), 3-19? No. 29-19 (yes). 19, 10, 37: 19-10 (yes), 19-37? 10-37 (yes), 10-19 (yes), 10-37 (yes), 19-37? Let's check 19's edges: 19-33, 19-29, 10-19. 37's edges: 10-37, 12-37, 13-37, 37-38. So 19-37? No. So 10-19-37: 10-19 and 10-37, but 19-37 not connected. 12, 7, 3: 12-7 (yes), 12-3 (yes), 7-3? 7-20, 7-12. No. So 12-7-3: 12 connected to both, but 7 and 3 not connected. 28, 1, 12: 28-1 (yes), 28-12 (yes), 1-12? 1-28, 1-26. No. So 28-1-12: 28 connected to both, 1 and 12 not connected. 33, 2, 8: 33-2 (yes), 33-8 (yes), 2-8? 2-33, 8-33, 2-9. No 2-8. 33, 6, 8: 33-6, 33-8, 6-8? 6-33, 8-33, 6-26, 6-29. No. 33, 19, 30: 33-19, 33-30, 19-30? 19-33, 30-33, 19-29, 30-21. No. 29, 15, 18: 29-15 (yes), 29-18 (yes), 15-18 (yes! 15-18 is an edge). Oh! 15-29, 15-18, 18-29. Let's check the edges list: 15 - 29, 15 - 18, 18 - 29. Yes! So 15, 18, 29 form a triangle. That's a 3-clique. So these three nodes must each have a different color. That's a good starting point.\n\nSo 15, 18, 29: let's assign them colors 0, 1, 2. Let's say 15=0, 18=1, 29=2. Now, their neighbors need to be colored with colors not equal to theirs.\n\nLet's list neighbors of 15: 4, 14, 29, 18. 15's neighbors are 4,14,29,18. So 4 can't be 0 (since 15=0), 14 can't be 0, 29=2, 18=1. So 4 must be 1 or 2; 14 must be 1 or 2.\n\nNeighbors of 18: 29, 15. 18's neighbors are 29 (2) and 15 (0), so 18=1 is okay. 18's other edges? The edge list says 18-29, 15-18. Are there others? Let me check: 18-29 is there, 15-18 is there. Any others? 18 is only connected to 15 and 29? Let me confirm: 18 is in the edges list as 18-29 and 15-18. So 18's neighbors are 15 and 29. So 18's color 1 is okay.\n\nNeighbors of 29: 18 (1), 15 (0), 6, 19, 3. 29=2, so 6 can't be 2, 19 can't be 2, 3 can't be 2.\n\nNow, let's look at 6. 6 is connected to 33, 26, 29. 29=2, so 6 can't be 2. 6's other neighbors: 33 and 26. Let's hold 6 for now.\n\n19 is connected to 33, 29, 10. 29=2, so 19 can't be 2. 19's other neighbors: 33 and 10.\n\n3 is connected to 12, 26, 29. 29=2, so 3 can't be 2. 3's other neighbors: 12 and 26.\n\nLet's move to 10. 10 is connected to 37, 19. 19 is connected to 10, 33, 29. 10-19 is an edge, so 10 can't be the same as 19. 10 is also connected to 37. 37 is connected to 10, 12, 13, 38.\n\nLet's check 4. 4 is connected to 15 (0) and 10. So 4 can't be 0, and 4 can't be the same as 10. Let's assume 4 is 1 for now. Then 10, which is connected to 4 (1), can't be 1. 10 is also connected to 19 (which can't be 2, let's say 19 is 0, then 10 can't be 0). So 10 would have to be 2. Let's try: 19=0, 10=2. Then 4=1 (since 4 can't be 0, and 4-10=2, so 4 can be 1). That works.\n\n19=0, 10=2. 10 is connected to 37, so 37 can't be 2. 37 is also connected to 12 and 13. 37 is connected to 38, which is connected to 11, 24, 37.\n\n12 is connected to 28, 37, 3, 7. 37 can't be 2 (since 10=2 and 10-37), so 37 could be 0 or 1. Let's say 37=0. Then 12 can't be 0 (since 12-37). 12 is also connected to 28, 3, 7. Let's see 28: 28 is connected to 1, 12, 11. 12-28, so 28 can't be the same as 12. 1 is connected to 28 and 26. 11 is connected to 28 and 38.\n\n3 is connected to 12, 26, 29 (2). 3 can't be 2, and 3 can't be the same as 12. Let's say 12=1 (since 12 can't be 0 (37=0)). Then 3 can't be 1 (since 3-12=1), so 3 must be 0. 3=0. 3 is connected to 26, so 26 can't be 0. 26 is connected to 1, 6, 3. 3=0, so 26 can't be 0. 26's neighbors: 1, 6. 1 is connected to 28 and 26. 6 is connected to 26, 33, 29 (2). 6 can't be 2 (from 29), and 6 can't be the same as 26.\n\nLet's get back to 28. 28 is connected to 1, 12 (1), 11. 12=1, so 28 can't be 1. 28 could be 0 or 2. Let's say 28=0. Then 1 (connected to 28=0) can't be 0. 1 is connected to 26, so 1 can't be the same as 26. 11 is connected to 28 (0), so 11 can't be 0. 11 is connected to 38, so 11 can't be the same as 38.\n\n38 is connected to 11, 24, 37 (0). So 38 can't be 0. 38 could be 1 or 2. 37=0, 38-37, so 38 can't be 0. Let's say 38=1. Then 11 (connected to 38=1) can't be 1. 11 is connected to 28=0, so 11 can't be 0. So 11 must be 2. 11=2.\n\n24 is connected to 38 (1), so 24 can't be 1. 24 could be 0 or 2. Let's leave 24 for now.\n\n26 is connected to 1, 6, 3 (0). 3=0, so 26 can't be 0. Let's say 26=1. Then 1 (connected to 26=1) can't be 1. 1 is connected to 28=0, so 1 can't be 0. So 1 must be 2. 1=2. 1 is connected to 28=0 and 26=1, which is okay.\n\n6 is connected to 26=1, 33, 29=2. So 6 can't be 1 or 2. So 6 must be 0. 6=0. 6 is connected to 26=1 (okay), 29=2 (okay), 33 (so 33 can't be 0).\n\n33 is connected to 2, 6=0, 8, 19=0, 27, 30. So 33 can't be 0 (since 6=0 and 19=0). 33's neighbors: 2,8,19=0,27,30. 33 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 33=1. Then 2 (connected to 33=1) can't be 1. 2 is connected to 9. 8 (connected to 33=1) can't be 1. 8 is connected to 13. 19=0 is already handled. 27 (connected to 33=1) can't be 1. 30 (connected to 33=1) can't be 1.\n\n2 is connected to 33=1 and 9. Let's say 2=0. Then 9 (connected to 2=0) can't be 0. 9 is connected to 14 and 32. 9 is also connected to 14 and 32. 14 is connected to 9 and 15=0. 15=0, so 14 can't be 0. 14 is connected to 9, so 14 can't be the same as 9.\n\n8 is connected to 33=1 and 13. Let's say 8=2. Then 13 (connected to 8=2) can't be 2. 13 is connected to 31 and 37=0. 37=0, so 13 can't be 0. So 13 must be 1. 13=1. 13 is connected to 31, so 31 can't be 1. 31 could be 0 or 2.\n\n27 is connected to 33=1, so 27 can't be 1. Let's say 27=0. 27=0.\n\n30 is connected to 33=1 and 21. 30 can't be 1. Let's say 30=0. Then 21 (connected to 30=0) can't be 0. 21 is connected to 20. 20 is connected to 16, 7, 21. 20's neighbors: 16,7,21.\n\n20 is connected to 7 and 21. 7 is connected to 20 and 12=1. 12=1, so 7 can't be 1. 7 is connected to 20, so 7 can't be the same as 20. 21 is connected to 20 and 30=0, so 21 can't be 0. Let's assume 20=1. Then 7 (connected to 20=1) can't be 1. 7 is connected to 12=1, which is okay (7 can't be 1). 7 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 7=0. Then 20=1 (connected to 7=0, okay). 21 is connected to 20=1 and 30=0, so 21 can be 2 (since 21 can't be 0). 21=2. 21 is connected to 20=1 and 30=0, okay.\n\n16 is connected to 20=1, so 16 can't be 1. 16 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 16=0. 16=0.\n\n19=0, 10=2, 37=0, 12=1, 3=0, 26=1, 1=2, 6=0, 33=1, 2=0, 8=2, 13=1, 27=0, 30=0, 20=1, 7=0, 21=2, 16=0.\n\nNow, 9 is connected to 2=0 and 14, 32. 2=0, so 9 can't be 0. Let's say 9=2. Then 14 (connected to 9=2) can't be 2. 14 is connected to 15=0, so 14 can't be 0. So 14 must be 1. 14=1. 14 is connected to 15=0 and 9=2, okay.\n\n32 is connected to 9=2, so 32 can't be 2. 32 can be 0 or 1. Let's say 32=0. 32=0.\n\n31 is connected to 13=1, so 31 can't be 1. 31 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 31=0. 31=0.\n\nNow, 4 is connected to 15=0 and 10=2. 4 can be 1 (since 4 can't be 0 or 2). 4=1. 4=1, which is okay.\n\n17 and 22 are connected to each other (17-22). They are not connected to others (assuming from edge list: 17-22 is the only edge for them). So 17 and 22 can be colored 0 and 1, or 1 and 0, etc. Let's say 17=0, 22=1.\n\n0 and 5 are connected (0-5). They are not connected to others (edge list: 0-5). So 0 can be 0, 5 can be 1.\n\n34 and 36 are connected (34-36). They are not connected to others. So 34=0, 36=1.\n\n24 is connected to 38=1. 24 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 24=0.\n\n35 is a node? Wait, the nodes are 0-38. Let's check if 35 is in the edge list. The edges listed: 1-28, 10-37, 16-20, 2-33, 7-20, 18-29, 6-33, 4-15, 12-28, 9-14, 0-5, 12-37, 8-33, 19-33, 9-32, 30-33, 11-38, 15-29, 24-38, 6-26, 3-12, 6-29, 21-30, 14-15, 34-36, 37-38, 27-33, 19-29, 11-28, 7-12, 1-26, 13-31, 13-37, 20-21, 4-10, 3-26, 8-13, 17-22, 3-29, 2-9, 10-19, 15-18. So 35 is a node with no edges.

The goal is to color 34 nodes (0-33) with exactly 3 colors such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. First, I need to understand the structure of the graph by looking at the edges provided. Let's list out all the edges and see which nodes are connected.\n\nFirst, let's list all the edges:\n\n1 - 28, 25 - 29, 1 - 31, 6 - 15, 26 - 33, 3 - 16, 20 - 29, 14 - 25, 9 - 11, 17 - 24, 17 - 27, 6 - 8, 4 - 8, 23 - 30, 8 - 11, 0 - 1, 2 - 4, 3 - 27, 2 - 7, 10 - 14, 1 - 11, 1 - 5, 14 - 27, 1 - 8, 10 - 20, 6 - 7, 18 - 24, 18 - 27, 4 - 13, 3 - 17, 14 - 20, 5 - 26, 19 - 25, 0 - 15, 6 - 9.\n\nLet me start by identifying nodes with high degrees since they are more constrained. Let's check node 1: connected to 28, 31, 0, 11, 5, 8. That's 6 edges. Node 8 is connected to 6, 4, 11, 1. So 4 edges. Node 14: connected to 25, 10, 27, 20. 4 edges. Node 27: connected to 17, 3, 14, 18. 4 edges. Node 6: connected to 15, 8, 7, 9. 4 edges. Node 25: connected to 29, 14, 19. 3 edges. Node 29: connected to 25, 20. 2 edges. Node 20: connected to 29, 10, 14. 3 edges. Node 11: connected to 9, 8, 1. 3 edges. Node 0: connected to 1, 15. 2 edges. Node 5: connected to 1, 26. 2 edges. Node 26: connected to 5, 33. 2 edges. Node 33: connected to 26. 1 edge. Node 3: connected to 16, 27, 17. 3 edges. Node 16: connected to 3. 1 edge. Node 17: connected to 24, 27, 3. 3 edges. Node 24: connected to 17, 18. 2 edges. Node 18: connected to 24, 27. 2 edges. Node 4: connected to 8, 2, 13. 3 edges. Node 2: connected to 4, 7. 2 edges. Node 7: connected to 2, 6. 2 edges. Node 13: connected to 4. 1 edge. Node 9: connected to 11, 6. 2 edges. Node 10: connected to 14, 20. 2 edges. Node 23: connected to 30. 1 edge. Node 30: connected to 23. 1 edge. Node 19: connected to 25. 1 edge. Node 28: connected to 1. 1 edge. Node 31: connected to 1. 1 edge. Node 15: connected to 6, 0. 2 edges.\n\nSo nodes with higher degrees are 1 (degree 6), 8 (degree 4), 14 (degree 4), 27 (degree 4), 6 (degree 4), 4 (degree 3), 17 (degree 3), 3 (degree 3), 20 (degree 3), 25 (degree 3), 11 (degree 3).\n\nLet's start with node 1. Since it's connected to many nodes, let's assign it color 0. Then all its neighbors (0, 5, 8, 11, 28, 31) can't be 0.\n\nNode 0 is connected to 1 and 15. Node 0 can't be 0. Let's assign 1. Then node 15 (connected to 0 and 6) can't be 1. Let's check node 6. Node 6 is connected to 15, 8, 7, 9. Let's see node 8 is connected to 1 (color 0), 6, 4, 11. Node 8 can't be 0. Let's see node 11 is connected to 1 (0), 9, 8. So node 11 can't be 0.\n\nLet's proceed step by step:\n\n1: color 0.\n\nNeighbors of 1: 0, 5, 8, 11, 28, 31. All can't be 0.\n\nNode 0: connected to 1 (0) and 15. Let's color 0 as 1. So 0:1.\n\nNode 15: connected to 0 (1) and 6. So 15 can't be 1. Let's color 15:0.\n\nNode 6: connected to 15 (0), 8, 7, 9. 6 can't be 0. Let's check 8. Node 8 is connected to 1 (0), 6, 4, 11. Let's assign 8 a color. 8 can't be 0. Let's say 8:1. Then 6 can't be 1 (since 6-8). So 6 can be 2. 6:2.\n\nNode 7: connected to 2 and 6 (2). So 7 can't be 2. Let's check 2. Node 2 is connected to 4 and 7. 2 can be 0,1, or 2, but 7's color will depend. Let's proceed.\n\nNode 9: connected to 6 (2) and 11. 9 can't be 2. Let's say 9:0.\n\nNode 11: connected to 1 (0), 9 (0), 8 (1). 11 can't be 0 or 1 (since 8 is 1). So 11 must be 2. 11:2.\n\nNode 8: connected to 11 (2). 8 is 1, which is okay. 8:1 is okay.\n\nNode 4: connected to 8 (1), 2, 13. 4 can't be 1. Let's assign 4:0. Then 2 (connected to 4 (0)) can't be 0. 2:1 or 2. Node 2 is connected to 7. Let's see 7: connected to 2 and 6 (2). 7 can't be 2, so 7:0 or 1. If 2 is 1, then 7 can be 0. Let's try 2:1. Then 7:0. 7:0.\n\nNode 13: connected to 4 (0). 13 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 13:1.\n\nNode 5: connected to 1 (0) and 26. 5 can't be 0. Let's assign 5:1. Then 26: connected to 5 (1) and 33. 26 can't be 1. Let's assign 26:0. 33: connected to 26 (0), so 33:1 or 2. Let's say 33:1.\n\nNode 28: connected to 1 (0). 28 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 28:1.\n\nNode 31: connected to 1 (0). 31 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 31:2.\n\nNode 14: connected to 25, 10, 27, 20. Let's see. 14's neighbors: 25, 10, 27, 20. Let's check 25: connected to 29, 14, 19. 25 can be 0,1,2. Let's see 14: maybe 0. Let's try 14:0. Then 25 can't be 0. 25:1 or 2. 19: connected to 25. If 25 is 1, 19 can be 0 or 2. Let's proceed.\n\nNode 10: connected to 14 (0) and 20. 10 can't be 0. Let's assign 10:1. Then 20: connected to 10 (1), 14 (0), 29. 20 can't be 0 or 1. So 20:2. 29: connected to 20 (2) and 25. 29 can't be 2. Let's say 25 is 1, then 29 can't be 1 (if 25 is 1). Let's check 25: connected to 14 (0), 29, 19. 25 can be 1. 25:1. Then 29: connected to 25 (1) and 20 (2). 29 can't be 1 or 2. So 29:0. That works. 29:0. 19: connected to 25 (1). 19 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 19:0.\n\nNode 27: connected to 14 (0), 3, 17, 18. 27 can't be 0. Let's assign 27:1. Then 3: connected to 27 (1), 16, 17. 3 can't be 1. Let's assign 3:0. 16: connected to 3 (0). 16:1 or 2. Let's assign 16:1. 17: connected to 3 (0), 24, 27 (1). 17 can't be 0 or 1. So 17:2. 24: connected to 17 (2) and 18. 24 can't be 2. Let's assign 24:0. 18: connected to 24 (0) and 27 (1). 18 can't be 0 or 1. So 18:2.\n\nNode 23: connected to 30. Let's assign 23:0, 30:1.\n\nNow let's check all nodes:\n\n0:1 (neighbors 1:0, 15:0. 1 is 0, 15 is 0. 1 is okay, 0's color is 1, no conflict.)\n\n1:0 (neighbors 0:1,5:1,8:1,11:2,28:1,31:2. All different from 0. Good.)\n\n2:1 (neighbors 4:0,7:0. 1 vs 0: okay.)\n\n3:0 (neighbors 16:1,27:1,17:2. 0 vs 1,2: okay.)\n\n4:0 (neighbors 8:1,2:1,13:1. 0 vs 1: okay.)\n\n5:1 (neighbors 1:0,26:0. 1 vs 0: okay.)\n\n6:2 (neighbors 15:0,8:1,7:0,9:0. 2 vs 0,1: okay.)\n\n7:0 (neighbors 2:1,6:2. 0 vs 1,2: okay.)\n\n8:1 (neighbors 6:2,4:0,11:2,1:0. 1 vs 0,2: okay.)\n\n9:0 (neighbors 11:2,6:2. 0 vs 2: okay.)\n\n10:1 (neighbors 14:0,20:2. 1 vs 0,2: okay.)\n\n11:2 (neighbors 9:0,8:1,1:0. 2 vs 0,1: okay.)\n\n12: Wait, node 12 isn't mentioned in any edges. Oh right, the edges list doesn't include node 12. So node 12 is isolated. So it can be colored with any color, say 0.\n\n13:1 (neighbors 4:0. 1 vs 0: okay.)\n\n14:0 (neighbors 25:1,10:1,27:1,20:2. 0 vs 1,2: okay.)\n\n15:0 (neighbors 0:1,6:2. 0 vs 1,2: okay.)\n\n16:1 (neighbors 3:0. 1 vs 0: okay.)\n\n17:2 (neighbors 24:0,27:1,3:0. 2 vs 0,1: okay.)\n\n18:2 (neighbors 24:0,27:1. 2 vs 0,1: okay.)\n\n19:0 (neighbors 25:1. 0 vs 1: okay.)\n\n20:2 (neighbors 29:0,10:1,14:0. 2 vs 0,1: okay.)\n\n21: Not mentioned in edges. Isolated. Color 0.\n\n22: Not mentioned. Isolated. Color 0.\n\n23:0 (neighbors 30:1. 0 vs 1: okay.)\n\n24:0 (neighbors 17:2,18:2. 0 vs 2: okay.)\n\n25:1 (neighbors 29:0,14:0,19:0. 1 vs 0: okay.)\n\n26:0 (neighbors 5:1,33:1. 0 vs 1: okay.)\n\n27:1 (neighbors 17:2,3:0,14:0,18:2. 1 vs 0,2: okay.)\n\n28:1 (neighbors 1:0. 1 vs 0: okay.)\n\n29:0 (neighbors 25:1,20:2. 0 vs 1,2: okay.)\n\n30:1 (neighbors 23:0. 1 vs 0: okay.)\n\n31:2 (neighbors 1:0. 2 vs 0: okay.)\n\n32: Not mentioned. Isolated. Color 0.\n\n33:1 (neighbors 26:0. 1 vs 0: okay.)\n\nWait, node 12, 21, 22, 32 are isolated. They can take any color. Let's assign them color 0 for simplicity.\n\nNow check all edges:\n\n1-28: 1 is 0, 28 is 1. Good.\n\n25-29: 25 is 1, 29 is 0. Good.\n\n1-31: 1 is 0, 31 is 2. Good.\n\n6-15: 6 is 2, 15 is 0.

The goal is to color all 50 nodes with exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2) such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. First, I need to understand the structure of the graph by looking at the edges provided.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the edges to see which nodes are connected:\n\n41-43, 10-40, 2-42, 6-24, 13-42, 16-38, 5-13, 22-23, 17-21, 17-24, 0-17, 10-15, 27-37, 4-45, 5-34, 14-49, 34-46, 15-17, 6-14, 24-29, 41-45, 5-6, 10-48, 29-34, 18-40, 5-18, 29-40, 8-14, 6-47, 1-2, 9-13, 12-36, 21-48, 23-39, 4-38, 10-23, 17-44, 7-24, 1-38, 43-47, 1-47, 2-46, 12-35, 14-32, 14-26, 34-44, 28-37, 5-35, 27-44.\n\nNow, let's identify nodes with high degrees, as they might be critical. Let's count the neighbors for each node:\n\n- Node 5: connected to 13, 34, 6, 18, 35 → 5 edges.\n- Node 6: connected to 24, 14, 5, 47 → 4 edges.\n- Node 10: connected to 40, 15, 48, 23 → 4 edges.\n- Node 14: connected to 49, 32, 26, 8, 6 → 5 edges.\n- Node 17: connected to 21, 24, 0, 15, 44 → 5 edges.\n- Node 24: connected to 6, 17, 29, 7 → 4 edges.\n- Node 29: connected to 24, 34, 40 → 3 edges.\n- Node 34: connected to 5, 46, 29, 44 → 4 edges.\n- Node 40: connected to 10, 18, 29 → 3 edges.\n- Node 1: connected to 2, 38, 47 → 3 edges.\n- Node 2: connected to 1, 42, 46 → 3 edges.\n- Node 13: connected to 42, 5, 9 → 3 edges.\n- Node 42: connected to 2, 13 → 2 edges.\n- Node 16: connected to 38 → 1 edge.\n- Node 38: connected to 16, 4, 1 → 3 edges.\n- Node 4: connected to 45, 38 → 2 edges.\n- Node 45: connected to 4, 41 → 2 edges.\n- Node 41: connected to 43, 45 → 2 edges.\n- Node 43: connected to 41, 47 → 2 edges.\n- Node 47: connected to 6, 43, 1 → 3 edges.\n- Node 22: connected to 23 → 1 edge.\n- Node 23: connected to 22, 39, 10 → 3 edges.\n- Node 39: connected to 23 → 1 edge.\n- Node 21: connected to 17, 48 → 2 edges.\n- Node 48: connected to 10, 21 → 2 edges.\n- Node 15: connected to 10, 17 → 2 edges.\n- Node 7: connected to 24 → 1 edge.\n- Node 8: connected to 14 → 1 edge.\n- Node 9: connected to 13 → 1 edge.\n- Node 12: connected to 36, 35 → 2 edges.\n- Node 36: connected to 12 → 1 edge.\n- Node 35: connected to 12, 5 → 2 edges.\n- Node 46: connected to 34, 2 → 2 edges.\n- Node 49: connected to 14 → 1 edge.\n- Node 32: connected to 14 → 1 edge.\n- Node 26: connected to 14 → 1 edge.\n- Node 27: connected to 37, 44 → 2 edges.\n- Node 37: connected to 27, 28 → 2 edges.\n- Node 28: connected to 37 → 1 edge.\n- Node 44: connected to 17, 34, 27 → 3 edges.\n- Node 0: connected to 17 → 1 edge.\n\nSo nodes with higher degrees (5) are 5, 14, 17. Let's start with these.\n\nLet's pick node 17 first. Let's color it 0. Its neighbors are 21, 24, 0, 15, 44. So these can't be 0.\n\nNode 0 is connected only to 17, so it can be 1 or 2. Let's color 0 with 1.\n\nNode 15 is connected to 10 and 17. 17 is 0, so 15 can be 1 or 2. Let's hold that for now.\n\nNode 21 is connected to 17 (0) and 48. So 21 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 21 with 1.\n\nNode 24 is connected to 6, 17 (0), 29, 7. So 24 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 24 with 1.\n\nNode 44 is connected to 17 (0), 34, 27. So 44 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 44 with 1.\n\nNow node 5 has neighbors 13, 34, 6, 18, 35. Let's color node 5 with 0. Then its neighbors can't be 0.\n\nNode 13 is connected to 42, 5 (0), 9. So 13 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 13 with 1.\n\nNode 34 is connected to 5 (0), 46, 29, 44 (1). So 34 can be 2 (since 0 and 1 are taken by neighbors). Let's color 34 with 2.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 24 (1), 14, 5 (0), 47. So 6 can be 2 (since 0 and 1 are taken). Let's color 6 with 2.\n\nNode 18 is connected to 40 and 5 (0). So 18 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 18 with 1.\n\nNode 35 is connected to 12, 5 (0). So 35 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 35 with 1.\n\nNode 14 has neighbors 49, 32, 26, 8, 6 (2). So 14 can be 0 or 1. Let's color 14 with 0.\n\nNode 49 is connected to 14 (0), so 49 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 49 with 1.\n\nNode 32 is connected to 14 (0), so 32 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 32 with 1.\n\nNode 26 is connected to 14 (0), so 26 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 26 with 1.\n\nNode 8 is connected to 14 (0), so 8 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 8 with 1.\n\nNode 29 is connected to 24 (1), 34 (2), 40. So 29 can be 0 (since 1 and 2 are taken). Let's color 29 with 0.\n\nNode 40 is connected to 10, 18 (1), 29 (0). So 40 can be 2 (since 0 and 1 are taken). Let's color 40 with 2.\n\nNode 10 is connected to 40 (2), 15, 48, 23. So 10 can be 0 or 1. Let's color 10 with 0.\n\nNode 15 is connected to 10 (0) and 17 (0). So 15 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 15 with 1.\n\nNode 48 is connected to 10 (0) and 21 (1). So 48 can be 2. Let's color 48 with 2.\n\nNode 23 is connected to 22, 39, 10 (0). So 23 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 23 with 1.\n\nNode 22 is connected to 23 (1), so 22 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 22 with 0.\n\nNode 39 is connected to 23 (1), so 39 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 39 with 0.\n\nNode 21 is already colored 1 (from earlier). Node 48 is 2, which is okay.\n\nNode 7 is connected to 24 (1), so 7 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 7 with 0.\n\nNode 47 is connected to 6 (2), 43, 1. Let's check 6 is 2, so 47 can be 0 or 1.\n\nNode 43 is connected to 41 and 47. 41 is connected to 43 and 45. 45 is connected to 4 and 41. 4 is connected to 45 and 38. 38 is connected to 16, 4, 1. 1 is connected to 2, 38, 47. 2 is connected to 1, 42, 46. 46 is connected to 34 (2) and 2.\n\nLet's handle 1. 1 is connected to 2, 38, 47. Let's color 1 with 0. Then 2, 38, 47 can't be 0.\n\nNode 2 is connected to 1 (0), 42, 46. So 2 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 2 with 1.\n\nNode 42 is connected to 2 (1) and 13 (1). So 42 can't be 1, so 0 or 2. Let's color 42 with 0.\n\nNode 46 is connected to 34 (2) and 2 (1). So 46 can be 0. Let's color 46 with 0.\n\nNode 38 is connected to 16, 4, 1 (0). So 38 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 38 with 1.\n\nNode 16 is connected to 38 (1), so 16 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 16 with 0.\n\nNode 4 is connected to 45 and 38 (1). So 4 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 4 with 0.\n\nNode 45 is connected to 4 (0) and 41. So 45 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 45 with 1.\n\nNode 41 is connected to 43 and 45 (1). So 41 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 41 with 0.\n\nNode 43 is connected to 41 (0) and 47. So 43 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 43 with 1.\n\nNode 47 is connected to 6 (2), 43 (1), 1 (0). So 47 can be 0? Wait, 1 is 0, 43 is 1, 6 is 2. So 47 can be 0. Let's color 47 with 0.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 13 (1), so 9 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 9 with 0.\n\nNode 12 is connected to 36 and 35 (1). So 12 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 12 with 0.\n\nNode 36 is connected to 12 (0), so 36 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 36 with 1.\n\nNode 27 is connected to 37 and 44 (1). So 27 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 27 with 0.\n\nNode 37 is connected to 27 (0) and 28. So 37 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 37 with 1.\n\nNode 28 is connected to 37 (1), so 28 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 28 with 0.\n\nNow, let's check all nodes:\n\n0: connected to 17 (0) → 0's color is 1 (correct, 1≠0).\n1: color 0, connected to 2 (1), 38 (1), 47 (0) → 47 is 0, which is same as 1's color (0). Oh, that's a problem! Node 1 and 47 are connected, both colored 0. Need to fix that.\n\nSo, let's adjust node 47. Node 47 is connected to 6 (2), 43 (1), 1 (0). So 47 can't be 0 (since 1 is 0), so 47 must be 2. Let's color 47 with 2.\n\nNow, 1 (0) and 47 (2) are okay. 43 (1) and 47 (2) are okay. 6 (2) and 47 (2) → same color! Oh, 6 is 2 and 47 is 2, and they are connected (edge 6-47). That's a conflict. So 6 and 47 are adjacent, so they can't both be 2.\n\nSo, 6 is connected to 24 (1), 14 (0), 5 (0), 47. 6 was colored 2. If 47 can't be 2, then 47 must be 0 or 1. But 1 is 0, so 47 can't be 0 (since 1 is 0). So 47 can be 1. Let's try 47 as 1.\n\nSo 47: 1. Then 1 (0) and 47 (1) are okay. 43 (1) and 47 (1) → same color! 43 is connected to 47, so 43 (1) and 47 (1) can't be. So 43 can't be 1. 43 is connected to 41 (0) and 47 (1). So 43 can be 2. Let's color 43 with 2.\n\nThen 47 is connected to 43 (2), 1 (0), 6 (2). 6 is 2, 47 can't be 2. So 47 must be 1. Now 43 is 2, 47 is 1: okay. 6 is 2, 47 is 1: okay. 1 is 0, 47 is 1: okay. Good.\n\nNow, 43 is 2. 41 is connected to 43 (2) and 45 (1). 41 was 0, which is okay (0≠2, 0≠1). So 41 is 0. 45 is 1, connected to 4 (0) and 41 (0): okay.\n\nNode 38 is 1, connected to 16, 4 (0), 1 (0): okay.\n\nNode 2 is 1, connected to 1 (0), 42 (0), 46 (0): okay.\n\nNode 46 is 0, connected to 34 (2) and 2 (1): okay.\n\nNode 42 is 0, connected to 2 (1) and 13 (1): okay.\n\nNode 13 is 1, connected to 42 (0), 5 (0), 9: okay. 9 is connected to 13 (1), so 9 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 9 with 0.\n\nNode 5 is 0, connected to 13 (1), 34 (2), 6 (2), 18 (1), 35 (1): all different. Good.\n\nNode 6 is 2, connected to 24 (1), 14 (0), 5 (0), 47 (1): all different.

Let's color 7 with 0.\n\nNode 29 is 0, connected to 24 (1), 34 (2), 40 (2): 0≠1, 0≠2, 0≠2. Good.\n\nNode 40 is 2, connected to 10 (0), 18 (1), 29 (0): 2≠0, 2≠1, 2≠0. Good.\n\nNode 10 is 0, connected to 40 (2), 15 (1), 48 (2), 23 (1): 0≠2, 0≠1, 0≠2, 0≠1. Good.\n\nNode 15 is 1, connected to 10 (0) and 17 (0): 1≠0. Good.\n\nNode 17 is 0, connected to 21 (1), 24 (1), 0 (1), 15 (1), 44 (1): 0≠1. Good.\n\nNode 21 is 1, connected to 17 (0) and 48 (2): 1≠0, 1≠2. Good.\n\nNode 48 is 2, connected to 10 (0) and 21 (1): 2≠0, 2≠1. Good.\n\nNode 23 is 1, connected to 22, 39, 10 (0): 1≠0. Let's color 22 and 39. 22 is connected to 23 (1), so 22 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 22 with 0. 39 is connected to 23 (1), so 39 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 39 with 0.\n\nNode 44 is 1, connected to 17 (0), 34 (2), 27: 1≠0, 1≠2. 27 is connected to 37 and 44 (1). Let's color 27 with 0. Then 37 is connected to 27 (0) and 28. Let's color 37 with 1. 28 is connected to 37 (1), so 28 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 28 with 0.\n\nNode 34 is 2, connected to 5 (0), 46 (0), 29 (0), 44 (1): 2≠0, 2≠0, 2≠0, 2≠1. Good.\n\nNode 35 is 1, connected to 12 and 5 (0). 12 is connected to 36 and 35 (1). Let's color 12 with 0. Then 36 is connected to 12 (0), so 36 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 36 with 1.\n\nNode 18 is 1, connected to 40 (2) and 5 (0): 1≠2, 1≠0. Good.\n\nNode 0 is 1, connected to 17 (0): 1≠0. Good.\n\nNode 44 is 1, connected to 17 (0), 34 (2), 27 (0): 1≠0, 1≠2, 1≠0. Good.\n\nNode 27 is 0, connected to 37 (1) and 44 (1): 0≠1, 0≠1. Good.\n\nNode 37 is 1, connected to 27 (0) and 28 (0): 1≠0, 1≠0. Good.\n\nNode 28 is 0, connected to 37 (1): 0≠1. Good.\n\nNode 7 is 0, connected to 24 (1): 0≠1.

Good.\n\nNode 16 is 0, connected to 38 (1): 0≠1. Good.\n\nNode 32 is 1, connected to 14 (0): 1≠0. Good.\n\nNode 26 is 1, connected to 14 (0): 1≠0. Good.\n\nNode 39 is 0, connected to 23 (1): 0≠1. Good.\n\nNode 49 is 1, connected to 14 (0): 1≠0. Good.\n\nNode 22 is 0, connected to 23 (1): 0≠1. Good.\n\nNode 36 is 1, connected to 12 (0): 1≠0. Good.\n\nNow, let's list all nodes with their colors:\n\n0:1, 1:0, 2:1, 3:?, 4:0, 5:0, 6:2, 7:0, 8:1, 9:0, 10:0, 11:?, 12:0, 13:1, 14:0, 15:1, 16:0, 17:0, 18:1, 19:?, 20:?, 21:1, 22:0, 23:1, 24:1, 25:?, 26:1, 27:0, 28:0, 29:0, 30:?, 31:?, 32:1, 33:?, 34:2, 35:1, 36:1, 37:1, 38:1, 39:0, 40:2, 41:0, 42:0, 43:2, 44:1, 45:1, 46:0, 47:1, 48:2, 49:1.\n\nWait, there are nodes 3, 11, 19, 20, 25, 30, 31, 33 that are not mentioned in any edges. These are isolated nodes. For isolated nodes, they can be colored with any color. Since we need to use exactly 3 colors, we need to ensure that all three colors are used. Let's check if we have all three colors (0,1,2) in the current coloring.\n\nCurrent colors used: 0 (many), 1 (many), 2 (nodes 6, 34, 40, 43, 48). So 2 is present. So the isolated nodes can be colored with any, but let's assign them to 0,1,2 as needed. Let's color them with 0,1,2 to fill in.\n\nNode 3: let's color 0.\nNode 11: color 1.\nNode 19: color 2.\nNode 20: color 0.\nNode 25: color 1.\nNode 30: color 2.\nNode 31: color 0.\nNode 33: color 1.\n\nNow, let's verify all edges again to ensure no conflicts:\n\n41-43: 41=0, 43=2 → okay.\n10-40: 10=0, 40=2 → okay.\n2-42: 2=1, 42=0 → okay.\n6-24: 6=2, 24=1 → okay.\n13-42: 13=1, 42=0 → okay.\n16-38: 16=0, 38=1 → okay.\n5-13: 5=0, 13=1 → okay.\n22-23: 22=0, 23=1 → okay.\n17-21: 17=0, 21=1 → okay.\n17-24: 17=0, 24=1 → okay.\n0-17: 0=1, 17=0 → okay.\n10-15: 10=0, 15=1 → okay.\n27-37: 27=0, 37=1 → okay.\n4-45: 4=0, 45=1 → okay.\n5-34: 5=0, 34=2 → okay.\n14-49: 14=0, 49=1 → okay.\n34-46: 34=2, 46=0 → okay.\n15-17: 15=1, 17=0 → okay.\n6-14: 6=2, 14=0 → okay.\n24-29: 24=1, 29=0 → okay.\n41-45: 41=0, 45=1 → okay.\n5-6: 5=0, 6=2 → okay.\n10-48: 10=0, 48=2 → okay.\n29-34: 29=0, 34=2 → okay.\n18-40: 18=1, 40=2 → okay.\n5-18: 5=0, 18=1 → okay.\n29-40: 29=0, 40=2 → okay.\n8-14: 8=1, 14=0 → okay.\n6-47: 6=2, 47=1 → okay.\n1-2: 1=0, 2=1 → okay.\n9-13: 9=0, 13=1 → okay.\n12-36: 12=0, 36=1 → okay.\n21-48: 21=1, 48=2 → okay.\n23-39: 23=1, 39=0 → okay.\n4-38: 4=0, 38=1 → okay.\n10-23: 10=0, 23=1 → okay.\n17-44: 17=0, 44=1 → okay.\n7-24: 7=0, 24=1 → okay.\n1-38: 1=0, 38=1 → okay.\n43-47: 43=2, 47=1 → okay.\n1-47: 1=0, 47=1 → okay.\n2-46: 2=1, 46=0 → okay.\n12-35: 12=0, 35=1 → okay.\n14-32: 14=0, 32=1 → okay.\n14-26: 14=0, 26=1 → okay.\n34-44: 34=2, 44=1 → okay.\n28-37: 28=0, 37=1 → okay.\n5-35: 5=0, 35=1 → okay.\n27-44: 27=0, 44=1 → okay.\n\nAll edges are checked and no conflicts. Isolated nodes are colored with 0,1,2, and all three colors are used. So this should be a valid 3-coloring.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0, 1], [1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0], [6, 2], [7, 0], [8, 1], [9, 0], [10, 0], [11, 1], [12, 0], [13, 1], [14, 0], [15, 1], [16, 0], [17, 0], [18, 1], [19, 2], [20, 0], [21, 1], [22, 0], [23, 1], [24, 1], [25, 1], [26, 1], [27, 0], [28, 0], [29, 0], [30, 2], [31, 0], [32, 1], [33, 1], [34, 2], [35, 1], [36, 1], [37, 1], [38, 1], [39, 0], [40, 2], [41, 0], [42, 0], [43, 2], [44, 1], [45, 1], [46, 0], [47, 1], [48, 2], [49, 1]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

First, I need to list all the nodes and their edges to see the connections. The nodes are 0-11. Let's list the adjacency for each node:\n\n- Node 0: connected to 9, 2 (edges 0-9, 0-2)\n- Node 1: connected to 2, 7 (edges 1-2, 1-7)\n- Node 2: connected to 1, 0, 6, 11 (edges 1-2, 0-2, 2-6, 2-11)\n- Node 3: Wait, do I see any edges with node 3? Let me check the edges again. The edges are: 10-11, 1-2, 6-8, 0-9, 5-7, 7-9, 1-7, 8-9, 0-2, 2-6, 5-9, 2-11, 7-8. Oh, node 3 has no edges! So it's an isolated node.\n- Node 4: Also, no edges listed. So node 4 is isolated too.\n- Node 5: connected to 7, 9 (edges 5-7, 5-9)\n- Node 6: connected to 8, 2 (edges 6-8, 2-6)\n- Node 7: connected to 5, 9, 1, 8 (edges 5-7, 7-9, 1-7, 7-8)\n- Node 8: connected to 6, 9, 7 (edges 6-8, 8-9, 7-8)\n- Node 9: connected to 0, 7, 8, 5 (edges 0-9, 7-9, 8-9, 5-9)\n- Node 10: connected to 11 (edge 10-11)\n- Node 11: connected to 10, 2 (edges 10-11, 2-11)\n\nSo nodes 3 and 4 are isolated, which means they can be colored with any color since they have no neighbors. That's easy. Let's handle the other nodes first.\n\nLet's start with node 9, which seems to have a lot of connections. Node 9 is connected to 0,7,8,5. Let's assign a color to node 9. Let's say color 0. Then its neighbors (0,7,8,5) can't be 0.\n\nNode 0 is connected to 9 (color 0) and 2. So node 0 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 2 is connected to 0 (1), 1, 6, 11. So node 2 can't be 1. Let's see node 1: node 1 is connected to 2 and 7. Let's see node 7: connected to 5,9 (0),1,8. So node 7 can't be 0. Let's try node 7 as color 1. Then node 1 is connected to 7 (1) and 2. So node 1 can't be 1. Let's say node 1 is 0. Then node 2 is connected to 1 (0) and 0 (1). So node 2 can't be 0 or 1, so node 2 must be 2.\n\nNow node 2 is color 2. Node 2 is connected to 6 and 11. So node 6 can't be 2. Node 6 is connected to 8 and 2 (2). Let's look at node 8: connected to 6,9 (0),7 (1). So node 8 can't be 0 or 1. So node 8 must be 2. Then node 6 is connected to 8 (2) and 2 (2). So node 6 can't be 2. Node 6 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 5 is connected to 7 (1) and 9 (0). So node 5 can't be 0 or 1. So node 5 must be 2.\n\nNode 7 is color 1. Node 8 is color 2. Node 9 is color 0. Node 0 is 1, node 1 is 0, node 2 is 2.\n\nNode 11 is connected to 2 (2) and 10. Let's check node 10: connected to 11. So node 10 can be any color except 11's color. Let's assign node 11 first. Node 11 is connected to 2 (2), so node 11 can be 0 or 1. Let's say 0. Then node 10 is connected to 11 (0), so node 10 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNow, node 3 is isolated, so any color. Let's pick 0. Node 4 is isolated, pick 1.\n\nLet's check all nodes:\n\n- 0: 1 (connected to 9(0), 2(2) → ok)\n- 1: 0 (connected to 2(2), 7(1) → ok)\n- 2: 2 (connected to 1(0), 0(1), 6(0), 11(0) → ok)\n- 3: 0 (no edges → ok)\n- 4: 1 (no edges → ok)\n- 5: 2 (connected to 7(1), 9(0) → ok)\n- 6: 0 (connected to 8(2), 2(2) → ok)\n- 7: 1 (connected to 5(2), 9(0), 1(0), 8(2) → ok)\n- 8: 2 (connected to 6(0), 9(0), 7(1) → ok)\n- 9: 0 (connected to 0(1), 7(1), 8(2), 5(2) → ok)\n- 10: 1 (connected to 11(0) → ok)\n- 11: 0 (connected to 10(1), 2(2) → ok)\n\nAll look good.

First, I need to list all the nodes and their edges. Let me start by listing all the nodes: 0 to 35. Then, let's note the adjacency list for each node based on the edges provided.\n\nLet's list the edges again to make sure I have them all:\n\n6-18, 2-27, 6-24, 4-6, 7-32, 4-21, 12-22, 4-18, 9-14, 0-14, 10-18, 0-11, 0-35, 7-25, 20-22, 14-18, 7-34, 3-15, 23-30, 29-34, 18-34, 4-17, 0-7, 3-30, 17-20, 3-27, 10-17, 1-14, 7-9, 24-25, 19-32, 2-22, 6-10, 21-23, 29-30, 8-16, 11-24, 2-21, 7-14.\n\nLet's build adjacency lists for each node:\n\n0: connected to 14, 11, 35, 7 (edges 0-14, 0-11, 0-35, 0-7)\n1: connected to 14 (1-14)\n2: connected to 27, 22, 21 (2-27, 2-22, 2-21)\n3: connected to 15, 30, 27 (3-15, 3-30, 3-27)\n4: connected to 6, 21, 18, 17 (4-6, 4-21, 4-18, 4-17)\n5: Let's check if 5 has any edges. The edges listed don't mention 5, so 5 is isolated.\n6: connected to 18, 24, 4, 10 (6-18, 6-24, 4-6, 6-10)\n7: connected to 32, 25, 34, 0, 9, 14 (7-32, 7-25, 7-34, 0-7, 7-9, 7-14)\n8: connected to 16 (8-16)\n9: connected to 14, 7 (9-14, 7-9)\n10: connected to 18, 17, 6 (10-18, 10-17, 6-10)\n11: connected to 0, 24 (0-11, 11-24)\n12: connected to 22 (12-22)\n13: No edges mentioned, isolated.\n14: connected to 9, 0, 18, 1, 7 (9-14, 0-14, 14-18, 1-14, 7-14)\n15: connected to 3 (3-15)\n16: connected to 8 (8-16)\n17: connected to 4, 20, 10 (4-17, 17-20, 10-17)\n18: connected to 6, 4, 10, 14, 34 (6-18, 4-18, 10-18, 14-18, 18-34)\n19: connected to 32 (19-32)\n20: connected to 22, 17 (20-22, 17-20)\n21: connected to 4, 23, 2 (4-21, 21-23, 2-21)\n22: connected to 12, 20, 2 (12-22, 20-22, 2-22)\n23: connected to 30, 21 (23-30, 21-23)\n24: connected to 6, 25, 11 (6-24, 24-25, 11-24)\n25: connected to 7, 24 (7-25, 24-25)\n26: No edges, isolated.\n27: connected to 2, 3 (2-27, 3-27)\n28: No edges, isolated.\n29: connected to 34, 30 (29-34, 29-30)\n30: connected to 23, 3, 29 (23-30, 3-30, 29-30)\n31: No edges, isolated.\n32: connected to 7, 19 (7-32, 19-32)\n33: No edges, isolated.\n34: connected to 7, 29, 18 (7-34, 29-34, 18-34)\n35: connected to 0 (0-35)\n\nNow, isolated nodes (5,13,16,26,28,31,33) can be colored with any color, since they have no neighbors. Let's handle them first. Let's assign 0 to 5, 13, 26, 28, 31, 33. Maybe 0, but since we need 3 colors, maybe spread them a bit. But maybe start with the connected components.\n\nLet's find connected components. The main connected component is the one containing 0, since 0 is connected to 14, 11, 35, 7, etc. Let's see which nodes are connected:\n\n0 is connected to 14, 11, 35, 7. 14 is connected to 9, 1, 18, 7. 7 is connected to 32, 25, 34, 9, 14. 18 is connected to 6,4,10,14,34. 6 is connected to 24,4,10. 4 is connected to 21,17. 21 is connected to 23,2. 2 is connected to 22,27. 22 is connected to 12,20. 20 is connected to 17. 17 is connected to 10. 10 is connected to 6. 24 is connected to 11,25. 25 is connected to 7. 34 is connected to 29,18. 29 is connected to 30. 30 is connected to 3,23. 3 is connected to 15,27. 27 is connected to 2,3. 23 is connected to 21,30. 32 is connected to 19. 19 is connected to 32. 15 is connected to 3. 1 is connected to 14. 9 is connected to 14,7. 11 is connected to 0,24. 12 is connected to 22. 35 is connected to 0. 8 is connected to 16 (but 16 is isolated? Wait, 8-16 is an edge, so 8 and 16 are connected. So 8 and 16 form a component. 5,13,26,28,31,33 are isolated.\n\nSo connected components:\n\nComponent 1: 0,1,2,3,4,6,7,9,10,11,12,14,15,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,27,29,30,31? Wait, 31 is isolated. Let's correct:\n\nComponent 1: All nodes except 5,8,13,16,26,28,31,33.\n\nComponent 2: 8,16 (since 8-16 is an edge)\n\nComponent 3: 5 (isolated)\n\nComponent 4: 13 (isolated)\n\nComponent 5: 26 (isolated)\n\nComponent 6: 28 (isolated)\n\nComponent 7: 31 (isolated)\n\nComponent 8: 33 (isolated)\n\nSo component 2 (8,16) is a pair connected by an edge. So 8 and 16 are adjacent, so they need different colors.\n\nLet's start with component 2: 8 and 16. Let's color 8 with 0, 16 with 1.\n\nIsolated nodes (5,13,26,28,31,33) can be colored with any color. Let's assign 0 to 5, 1 to 13, 2 to 26, 0 to 28, 1 to 31, 2 to 33. Doesn't matter as long as they don't conflict (but they have no edges, so any color is fine).\n\nNow, let's tackle the main component (component 1). Let's pick a starting node, say 0. Let's assign color 0 to 0.\n\n0's neighbors: 14,11,35,7. So 14,11,35,7 can't be 0.\n\nLet's assign 14 to color 1 (since 0 is 0). 14's neighbors: 9,0,18,1,7. 0 is 0, so 9,18,1,7 can't be 1 (since 14 is 1).\n\n1 (neighbor of 14) can't be 1, so 1 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\n9 (neighbor of 14) can't be 1, so 9 can be 0 or 2. 9 is also connected to 7. Let's see 7's color. 7 is connected to 0 (0), 14 (1), 32, 25, 34, 9. So 7 can't be 0 or 1, so 7 must be 2.\n\nSo 7 is 2. Then 9 is connected to 7 (2), so 9 can't be 2. 9 is connected to 14 (1), so 9 can't be 1. So 9 must be 0.\n\n9 is 0.\n\n14's neighbor 18: 18 is connected to 14 (1), 6,4,10,34. So 18 can't be 1. Let's assign 18 to 0.\n\n18's color is 0. Now, 18's neighbors: 6,4,10,14 (1),34. So 6,4,10,34 can't be 0.\n\n6 is connected to 18 (0), 24,4,10. So 6 can't be 0. Let's see 6's neighbors. 4 is connected to 6, 21, 18 (0),17. 4 can't be 0 (from 18). 10 is connected to 18 (0), 17, 6. 10 can't be 0.\n\nLet's look at 4. 4 is connected to 6,21,18 (0),17. 18 is 0, so 4 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 4 to 1.\n\n4 is 1. Then 6 is connected to 4 (1), so 6 can't be 1. 6 is connected to 18 (0), so 6 can't be 0. So 6 must be 2.\n\n6 is 2. 6's neighbors: 18 (0),24,4 (1),10. So 24 and 10 can't be 2.\n\n10 is connected to 18 (0),17,6 (2). So 10 can't be 0 or 2, so 10 must be 1.\n\n10 is 1. 10's neighbors: 18 (0),17,6 (2). So 17 can't be 1.\n\n17 is connected to 4 (1),20,10 (1). So 17 can't be 1. Let's assign 17 to 0.\n\n17 is 0. 17's neighbors: 4 (1),20,10 (1). So 20 can't be 0. 20 is connected to 22,17 (0). So 20 can be 1 or 2.\n\n20's neighbor 22: 22 is connected to 12,20,2. Let's see 2's color. 2 is connected to 27,22,21. 21 is connected to 4 (1),23,2. 21's color: 4 is 1, so 21 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 21 to 0. 21 is 0. Then 2 is connected to 21 (0), so 2 can't be 0. 2 is connected to 22 and 27. Let's assign 2 to 1.\n\n2 is 1. Then 22 is connected to 2 (1), so 22 can't be 1. 22 is connected to 12 and 20. 20 is connected to 17 (0), so 20 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 20 is 2. Then 22 is connected to 20 (2), so 22 can't be 2. 22 can't be 1 (from 2), so 22 must be 0. 22 is 0. 12 is connected to 22 (0), so 12 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 12 to 1.\n\n20 is 2. 20's neighbor 17 is 0, 22 is 0. Okay.\n\n21 is 0 (connected to 4 (1), 23, 2 (1)). 23 is connected to 30,21 (0). So 23 can be 1 or 2. 23 is connected to 30. 30 is connected to 23,3,29. 3 is connected to 15,30,27. 27 is connected to 2 (1),3. Let's look at 27: 2 is 1, so 27 can't be 1. 27 is connected to 3. 3 is connected to 15,30,27. Let's assign 27 to 0. 27 is 0. Then 3 is connected to 27 (0), so 3 can't be 0. 3 is connected to 15 and 30. Let's assign 3 to 1. 3 is 1. 15 is connected to 3 (1), so 15 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 15 to 0.\n\n30 is connected to 3 (1),23,29. 30 can't be 1. Let's assign 30 to 0. 30 is 0. 23 is connected to 30 (0), so 23 can't be 0. 23 is connected to 21 (0), so 23 can be 1 or 2. 23 is 1. 23 is 1. 29 is connected to 30 (0),34. 29 can be 1 or 2. 34 is connected to 7 (2),29,18 (0). 18 is 0, 7 is 2, so 34 can't be 0 or 2. So 34 must be 1. 34 is 1. Then 29 is connected to 34 (1), so 29 can't be 1. 29 is connected to 30 (0), so 29 can be 2. 29 is 2.\n\n25 is connected to 7 (2),24. 7 is 2, so 25 can't be 2. 24 is connected to 6 (2),25,11. 6 is 2, so 24 can't be 2. 24 is connected to 11 (which is connected to 0 (0)). 11 is connected to 0 (0) and 24. Let's assign 11 to 1. 11 is 1. Then 24 is connected to 11 (1), so 24 can't be 1. 24 can't be 2 (from 6), so 24 must be 0. 24 is 0. 25 is connected to 24 (0), so 25 can't be 0. 25 can't be 2 (from 7), so 25 must be 1. 25 is 1.\n\n32 is connected to 7 (2),19. 7 is 2, so 32 can be 0 or 1. Let's assign 32 to 0. 32 is 0. 19 is connected to 32 (0), so 19 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 19 to 1. 19 is 1.\n\n35 is connected to 0 (0), so 35 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 35 to 1. 35 is 1.\n\nLet's check all nodes in component 1:\n\n0: 0 (neighbors 14:1, 11:1, 35:1, 7:2 → okay)\n1: 0 (neighbor 14:1 → okay)\n2: 1 (neighbors 27:0, 22:0, 21:0 → okay)\n3: 1 (neighbors 15:0, 30:0, 27:0 → okay)\n4: 1 (neighbors 6:2, 21:0, 18:0, 17:0 → okay)\n6: 2 (neighbors 18:0, 24:0, 4:1, 10:1 → okay)\n7: 2 (neighbors 32:0, 25:1, 34:1, 0:0, 9:0, 14:1 → okay)\n9: 0 (neighbors 14:1, 7:2 → okay)\n10: 1 (neighbors 18:0, 17:0, 6:2 → okay)\n11: 1 (neighbors 0:0, 24:0 → okay)\n12: 1 (neighbor 22:0 → okay)\n14: 1 (neighbors 9:0, 0:0, 18:0, 1:0, 7:2 → okay)\n15: 0 (neighbor 3:1 → okay)\n17: 0 (neighbors 4:1, 20:2, 10:1 → okay)\n18: 0 (neighbors 6:2, 4:1, 10:1, 14:1, 34:1 → okay)\n19: 1 (neighbor 32:0 → okay)\n20: 2 (neighbors 22:0, 17:0 → okay)\n21: 0 (neighbors 4:1, 23:1, 2:1 → okay)\n22: 0 (neighbors 12:1, 20:2, 2:1 → okay)\n23: 1 (neighbors 30:0, 21:0 → okay)\n24: 0 (neighbors 6:2, 25:1, 11:1 → okay)\n25: 1 (neighbors 7:2, 24:0 → okay)\n27: 0 (neighbors 2:1, 3:1 → okay)\n29: 2 (neighbors 34:1, 30:0 → okay)\n30: 0 (neighbors 23:1, 3:1, 29:2 → okay)\n32: 0 (neighbors 7:2, 19:1 → okay)\n34: 1 (neighbors 7:2, 29:2, 18:0 → okay)\n35: 1 (neighbor 0:0 → okay)\n\nNow component 2: 8 and 16. 8-16. Let's assign 8:0, 16:1 (they can't be the same).\n\nIsolated nodes: 5,13,26,28,31,33. Let's assign 5:0, 13:1, 26:2, 28:0, 31:1, 33:2.

The goal is to color all 32 nodes (0-31) with exactly 3 colors (0,1,2) such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. First, I need to understand the structure of the graph by looking at the edges provided. Let's list out all the edges to see connections:\n\nEdges:\n0-30, 0-16, 0-28\n1-6\n2-26, 2-15, 2-30\n4-17\n5-10\n6-1, 6-14, 6-23\n7-13, 7-30\n8-21\n9-16\n12-21\n13-7, 13-21\n14-16, 14-15, 14-6\n15-14, 15-18, 15-2\n16-14, 16-22, 16-9, 16-0, 16-21, 16-24\n17-4\n18-15\n19-25\n20-27\n21-8, 21-12, 21-13, 21-16\n22-23, 22-26, 22-16, 22-28\n23-22, 23-6\n24-25, 24-16, 24-31\n25-24, 25-19\n26-22, 26-2\n27-20, 27-29\n28-22, 28-0\n29-27\n30-0, 30-7, 30-2\n31-24\n\nNow, let's start by identifying nodes with high degrees, as they might be critical. Let's count degrees:\n\n- Node 16: connected to 0,9,14,21,22,24 → degree 6\n- Node 22: connected to 16,23,26,28 → degree 4 (wait, 22-23, 22-26, 22-16, 22-28 → 4)\n- Node 21: connected to 8,12,13,16 → degree 4\n- Node 0: connected to 30,16,28 → degree 3\n- Node 30: connected to 0,7,2 → degree 3\n- Node 6: connected to 1,14,23 → degree 3\n- Node 14: connected to 6,15,16 → degree 3\n- Node 24: connected to 16,25,31 → degree 3\n- Node 2: connected to 26,15,30 → degree 3\n- Node 7: connected to 13,30 → degree 2\n- Others: like 1,4,5,8,9,10,12,13,17,18,19,20,25,27,28,29,31 have lower degrees.\n\nLet's start with node 16, which has high degree. Let's assign color 0 to node 16. Then its neighbors (0,9,14,21,22,24) can't be 0.\n\nNode 0 is connected to 16,28,30. Let's assign node 0 color 1 (since 16 is 0). Then 28 and 30 can't be 1.\n\nNode 28 is connected to 0 and 22. 0 is 1, so 28 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 28 is 2. Then 22 (connected to 28) can't be 2. 22 is also connected to 16 (0), 23, 26. So 22's color can be 1 (since 16 is 0, 28 is 2, so 22 can be 1).\n\nNode 22 is 1. Then 23 (connected to 22 and 6) can't be 1. 23's other neighbor is 6. Let's check 6: 6 is connected to 1,14,23. 6's color can't be 1 (if 1 is 0, maybe). Let's hold 6 for a moment.\n\nNode 24 is connected to 16 (0), 25, 31. 24 can't be 0. Let's assign 24 color 1. Then 25 (connected to 24 and 19) can't be 1. 25 can be 0 or 2. Let's say 25 is 0. Then 19 (connected to 25) can't be 0. 19 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 19 color 1.\n\nNode 31 is connected to 24 (1). 31 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 31 color 0.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 16 (0). 9 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 9 color 1.\n\nNode 14 is connected to 16 (0), 6, 15. 14 can't be 0. Let's assign 14 color 1. Then 6 (connected to 14) can't be 1. 6 is connected to 1 and 23. Let's assign 6 color 0. Then 1 (connected to 6) can't be 0. 1 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 1 color 1.\n\nNode 23 is connected to 22 (1) and 6 (0). So 23 can't be 1 or 0. That's a problem! 23 has neighbors 22 (1) and 6 (0), so 23 needs color 2. That works. So 23 is 2.\n\nNode 15 is connected to 14 (1), 18, 2. 14 is 1, so 15 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 15 color 0. Then 18 (connected to 15) can't be 0. 18 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 18 color 1.\n\nNode 2 is connected to 15 (0), 26, 30. 2 can't be 0. Let's assign 2 color 1. Then 26 (connected to 2 and 22) can't be 1. 22 is 1, so 26 can't be 1. 26 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 26 color 0.\n\nNode 30 is connected to 0 (1), 7, 2 (1). 30 can't be 1. So 30 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 30 color 0. Then 7 (connected to 30) can't be 0. 7 is connected to 13. Let's assign 7 color 1. Then 13 (connected to 7) can't be 1. 13 is also connected to 21. Let's assign 13 color 0.\n\nNode 21 is connected to 16 (0), 8, 12, 13 (0). 21 can't be 0. So 21 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 21 color 1. Then 8 (connected to 21) can't be 1. 8 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 8 color 0. 12 (connected to 21) can't be 1. 12 can be 0 or 2. Assign 12 color 0.\n\nNode 5 is connected to 10. They are not connected to others (assuming from the edge list; 5-10 is the only edge for 5 and 10). So 5 and 10 can be colored 0 and 1, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 2, etc. Let's assign 5 color 0, 10 color 1.\n\nNode 4 is connected to 17. 4-17 is the only edge. Assign 4 color 0, 17 color 1.\n\nNode 20 is connected to 27. 20-27 is the only edge. Assign 20 color 0, 27 color 1. 27 is also connected to 29. So 29 (connected to 27) can't be 1. Assign 29 color 0.\n\nLet's check all nodes now:\n\n0: 1 (neighbors 30,16,28: 30 is 0, 16 is 0, 28 is 2 → okay)\n1: 1 (neighbor 6: 6 is 0 → okay)\n2: 1 (neighbors 26,15,30: 26 is 0, 15 is 0, 30 is 0 → okay)\n3: Wait, node 3 is not in any edges. The edges listed don't include node 3. So node 3 is isolated. Can color it 0.\n4: 0 (neighbor 17: 17 is 1 → okay)\n5: 0 (neighbor 10: 10 is 1 → okay)\n6: 0 (neighbors 1,14,23: 1 is 1, 14 is 1, 23 is 2 → okay)\n7: 1 (neighbors 13,30: 13 is 0, 30 is 0 → okay)\n8: 0 (neighbor 21: 21 is 1 → okay)\n9: 1 (neighbor 16: 16 is 0 → okay)\n10: 1 (neighbor 5: 5 is 0 → okay)\n11: Node 11 is not in any edges. Isolated. Can color 0.\n12: 0 (neighbor 21: 21 is 1 → okay)\n13: 0 (neighbors 7,21: 7 is 1, 21 is 1 → okay)\n14: 1 (neighbors 6,15,16: 6 is 0, 15 is 0, 16 is 0 → okay)\n15: 0 (neighbors 14,18,2: 14 is 1, 18 is 1, 2 is 1 → okay)\n16: 0 (neighbors 0,9,14,21,22,24: 0 is 1, 9 is 1, 14 is 1, 21 is 1, 22 is 1, 24 is 1 → okay)\n17: 1 (neighbor 4: 4 is 0 → okay)\n18: 1 (neighbor 15: 15 is 0 → okay)\n19: 1 (neighbor 25: 25 is 0 → okay)\n20: 0 (neighbor 27: 27 is 1 → okay)\n21: 1 (neighbors 8,12,13,16: 8 is 0, 12 is 0, 13 is 0, 16 is 0 → okay)\n22: 1 (neighbors 23,26,16,28: 23 is 2, 26 is 0, 16 is 0, 28 is 2 → okay)\n23: 2 (neighbors 22,6: 22 is 1, 6 is 0 → okay)\n24: 1 (neighbors 25,16,31: 25 is 0, 16 is 0, 31 is 0 → okay)\n25: 0 (neighbors 24,19: 24 is 1, 19 is 1 → okay)\n26: 0 (neighbors 22,2: 22 is 1, 2 is 1 → okay)\n27: 1 (neighbors 20,29: 20 is 0, 29 is 0 → okay)\n28: 2 (neighbors 22,0: 22 is 1, 0 is 1 → okay)\n29: 0 (neighbor 27: 27 is 1 → okay)\n30: 0 (neighbors 0,7,2: 0 is 1, 7 is 1, 2 is 1 → okay)\n31: 0 (neighbor 24: 24 is 1 → okay)\n3: 0 (no neighbors)\n11: 0 (no neighbors)\n\nWait, let's check if all adjacent nodes have different colors. For example:\n\n- 22 (1) is connected to 23 (2), 26 (0), 16 (0), 28 (2) → all different. Good.\n- 23 (2) is connected to 22 (1) and 6 (0) → good.\n- 16 (0) has neighbors 0 (1),9 (1),14 (1),21 (1),22 (1),24 (1) → all 1, which is different. Good.\n- 0 (1) is connected to 30 (0),16 (0),28 (2) → all different. Good.\n- 28 (2) is connected to 22 (1) and 0 (1) → good.\n- 30 (0) is connected to 0 (1),7 (1),2 (1) → good.\n- 2 (1) is connected to 26 (0),15 (0),30 (0) → good.\n- 26 (0) is connected to 22 (1) and 2 (1) → good.\n- 15 (0) is connected to 14 (1),18 (1),2 (1) → good.\n- 14 (1) is connected to 6 (0),15 (0),16 (0) → good.\n- 6 (0) is connected to 1 (1),14 (1),23 (2) → good.\n- 1 (1) is connected to 6 (0) → good.\n- 21 (1) is connected to 8 (0),12 (0),13 (0),16 (0) → good.\n- 8 (0) is connected to 21 (1) → good.\n- 12 (0) is connected to 21 (1) → good.\n- 13 (0) is connected to 7 (1) and 21 (1) → good.\n- 7 (1) is connected to 13 (0) and 30 (0) → good.\n- 24 (1) is connected to 25 (0),16 (0),31 (0) → good.\n- 25 (0) is connected to 24 (1) and 19 (1) → good.\n- 19 (1) is connected to 25 (0) → good.\n- 31 (0) is connected to 24 (1) → good.\n- 5 (0) and 10 (1) → good.\n- 4 (0) and 17 (1) → good.\n- 20 (0) and 27 (1) → good.\n- 27 (1) and 29 (0) → good.\n- 29 (0) is connected to 27 (1) → good.\n- Isolated nodes 3 and 11 can be any color, here 0.\n\nAll adjacent nodes have different colors. Let's list all nodes with their colors:\n\n0:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:1, 8:0, 9:1, 10:1, 11:0, 12:0, 13:0, 14:1, 15:0, 16:0, 17:1, 18:1, 19:1, 20:0, 21:1, 22:1, 23:2, 24:1, 25:0, 26:0, 27:1, 28:2, 29:0, 30:0, 31:0.\n\nWait, node 23 is 2, which is allowed (since 3 colors). Node 28 is 2. Let's check if any other nodes need to be 2. Only 23 and 28 are 2. The rest are 0 or 1. Since we need exactly 3 colors, that's okay. Let's confirm:\n\nColors used: 0,1,2. Yes, all three are present (23 and 28 are 2, others 0\/1).

First, I need to list all the nodes and their edges. The nodes are 0-44, and there are a bunch of edges. Let's start by identifying the structure of the graph. Maybe some nodes have high degrees, so I should handle those first.\n\nLooking at the edges, let's list some nodes and their neighbors:\n\n- Node 27 is connected to 4, 10, 23, 20, 38, 41. That's 6 edges. So node 27 has a high degree. Let's note its neighbors.\n\n- Node 9 is connected to 42, 14, 16, 30. So 4 edges.\n\n- Node 18 is connected to 35, 37, 40, 36. 4 edges.\n\n- Node 0 is connected to 36, 7, 37. 3 edges.\n\n- Node 35 is connected to 18, 8, 32. 3 edges.\n\n- Node 32 is connected to 13, 35, 12. 3 edges.\n\n- Node 12 is connected to 23, 32, 11. 3 edges.\n\n- Node 23 is connected to 6, 27, 12. 3 edges.\n\n- Node 6 is connected to 21, 23, 31. 3 edges.\n\n- Node 21 is connected to 6, 30, 44. 3 edges.\n\n- Node 30 is connected to 21, 25, 9. 3 edges.\n\n- Node 25 is connected to 38, 30. 2 edges.\n\n- Node 38 is connected to 25, 27. 2 edges.\n\n- Node 41 is connected to 16, 14, 27. 3 edges.\n\n- Node 16 is connected to 41, 9. 2 edges.\n\n- Node 14 is connected to 9, 41. 2 edges.\n\n- Node 42 is connected to 9, 34. 2 edges.\n\n- Node 34 is connected to 42, 19. 2 edges.\n\n- Node 19 is connected to 34. 1 edge.\n\n- Node 40 is connected to 18, 43. 2 edges.\n\n- Node 43 is connected to 40, 31. 2 edges.\n\n- Node 31 is connected to 44, 43, 6. 3 edges.\n\n- Node 44 is connected to 31, 21, 3. 3 edges.\n\n- Node 3 is connected to 44. 1 edge.\n\n- Node 8 is connected to 4, 35, 10, 22. 4 edges.\n\n- Node 4 is connected to 27, 8. 2 edges.\n\n- Node 10 is connected to 27, 8. 2 edges.\n\n- Node 22 is connected to 8. 1 edge.\n\n- Node 7 is connected to 0. 1 edge.\n\n- Node 1 is connected to 17, 13. 2 edges.\n\n- Node 17 is connected to 15, 1. 2 edges.\n\n- Node 15 is connected to 17. 1 edge.\n\n- Node 13 is connected to 32, 1. 2 edges.\n\n- Node 2 is not mentioned in any edges. Oh, right! The edges list doesn't include node 2. So node 2 is isolated. That's easy; it can be colored with any color.\n\n- Similarly, node 5? Let's check the edges again. The edges given are: 0-36, 9-42, 6-21, 25-38, 18-35, 20-26, 16-41, 9-14, 31-44, 4-27, 10-27, 15-17, 6-23, 13-32, 4-8, 18-37, 21-30, 18-40, 23-27, 0-7, 40-43, 9-16, 31-43, 34-42, 8-35, 1-17, 32-35, 0-37, 25-30, 6-31, 12-23, 18-36, 20-27, 29-36, 8-10, 12-32, 11-12, 1-13, 21-44, 8-22, 3-44, 14-41, 27-38, 9-30, 19-34, 27-41. Let's list all nodes in edges: 0,36,9,42,6,21,25,38,18,35,20,26,16,41,14,31,44,4,27,10,15,17,23,13,32,8,37,30,40,43,34,19,29,12,11,22,7,3,1. So missing nodes are 2,5. Oh, node 5 isn't in any edge. So node 5 is also isolated. And node 2 as well.\n\nSo nodes 2,5 are isolated. They can take any color, say 0.\n\nNow, let's start building the coloring step by step. Let's pick a starting node. Let's take node 0. Let's color it 0.\n\nNode 0 is connected to 36,7,37. So 36,7,37 can't be 0. Let's color 36 as 1, 7 as 1, 37 as 2.\n\nNode 18 is connected to 35,37,40,36. 37 is 2, 36 is 1. So 18 can't be 1 or 2. So 18 must be 0.\n\nNode 18 is connected to 35. So 35 can't be 0. 35 is connected to 8 and 32. Let's see 35's color. 35 is connected to 18 (0), 8, 32. Let's hold 35 for a moment.\n\nNode 29 is connected to 36 (1). So 29 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 29 as 0.\n\nNode 27 is connected to 4,10,23,20,38,41. Let's see if we can find a color for 27. Let's check neighbors:\n\n- 4: connected to 27 and 8. 8 is connected to 4,35,10,22.\n\n- 10: connected to 27 and 8.\n\n- 23: connected to 6,27,12.\n\n- 20: connected to 26 and 27.\n\n- 38: connected to 25 and 27.\n\n- 41: connected to 16,14,27.\n\nLet's approach 8 first. Node 8 is connected to 4,35,10,22. Let's color 8 as 0. Then 4,35,10,22 can't be 0. 4: connected to 8 (0) and 27. So 4 can be 1 or 2. 10: connected to 8 (0) and 27. So 10 can be 1 or 2. 22: connected to 8 (0), so 22 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 22 as 1.\n\nNode 35 is connected to 18 (0) and 8 (0). So 35 can't be 0. 35 is also connected to 32. Let's look at 32. 32 is connected to 13,35,12. 13 is connected to 32 and 1. 12 is connected to 23,32,11. 11 is connected to 12. Let's color 32. Suppose 35 is 1. Then 32 can't be 1. 32 is connected to 13 and 12. Let's color 32 as 2. Then 13 can't be 2. 13 is connected to 1 and 32 (2). 1 is connected to 17 and 13. 17 is connected to 15 and 1. 15 is isolated? 15 is connected to 17. So 15 is part of a small chain: 15-17-1-13-32. Let's color 15: 0. Then 17 can't be 0. 17 is connected to 15 (0) and 1. Let's color 17 as 1. Then 1 can't be 1. 1 is connected to 17 (1) and 13. Let's color 1 as 0. Then 13 can't be 0 (since 1 is 0) and 13 is connected to 32 (2). So 13 can be 1. So 13 is 1. Then 32 (2) is okay. 35 is connected to 32 (2) and 18 (0), 8 (0). So 35 can be 1. That works. So 35:1.\n\nNow 8 is 0, 35 is 1. Then 32 is 2. 13 is 1, 1 is 0, 17 is 1, 15 is 0.\n\nNode 12 is connected to 23,32 (2),11. Let's color 12. 32 is 2, so 12 can't be 2. Let's color 12 as 0. Then 11 is connected to 12 (0), so 11 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 11 as 1.\n\nNode 23 is connected to 6,27,12 (0). So 23 can't be 0. Let's color 23 as 1. Then 6 is connected to 21,23 (1),31. So 6 can't be 1. 6 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 6 as 0.\n\nNode 21 is connected to 6 (0),30,44. So 21 can't be 0. Let's color 21 as 1. Then 30 is connected to 21 (1),25,9. 30 can't be 1. Let's color 30 as 0.\n\nNode 25 is connected to 38 and 30 (0). So 25 can't be 0. Let's color 25 as 1. Then 38 is connected to 25 (1) and 27. So 38 can't be 1. 38 can be 0 or 2.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 42,14,16,30 (0). So 9 can't be 0. Let's color 9 as 1. Then 42 is connected to 9 (1) and 34. So 42 can't be 1. 42 can be 0 or 2. 14 is connected to 9 (1) and 41. So 14 can't be 1. 14 can be 0 or 2. 16 is connected to 9 (1) and 41. So 16 can't be 1. 16 can be 0 or 2.\n\nNode 31 is connected to 44,43,6 (0). So 31 can't be 0. Let's color 31 as 1. Then 44 is connected to 31 (1),21 (1),3. So 44 can't be 1. 44 can be 0 or 2. 43 is connected to 31 (1) and 40. So 43 can't be 1. 43 can be 0 or 2. 40 is connected to 18 (0) and 43. So 40 can't be 0. 40 can be 1 or 2.\n\nNode 18 is 0, 40 is connected to 18 (0). So 40 can be 1 or 2. Let's say 40 is 1. Then 43 is connected to 40 (1), so 43 can't be 1. 43 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 43 as 0. Then 31 (1) is okay. 44 is connected to 21 (1),31 (1),3. Let's color 44 as 2. Then 3 is connected to 44 (2), so 3 can be 0 or 1. Let's color 3 as 0.\n\nNode 21 is 1, 44 is 2. That's okay.\n\nNode 30 is 0, 25 is 1, 38 is connected to 25 (1) and 27. Let's look at 27. 27 is connected to 4,10,23 (1),20,38,41. 23 is 1, so 27 can't be 1. Let's try to color 27 as 0. Then 4 (connected to 27 (0) and 8 (0)) can't be 0. So 4 must be 1 or 2. 10 (connected to 27 (0) and 8 (0)) can't be 0, so 10 must be 1 or 2. 20 (connected to 26 and 27 (0)) can't be 0. 38 (connected to 25 (1) and 27 (0)) can't be 0 or 1, so 38 must be 2. 41 (connected to 16,14,27 (0)) can't be 0. So 41 can be 1 or 2.\n\nIf 27 is 0, 38 is 2 (since 25 is 1 and 27 is 0, 38 can't be 1 or 0). That works. So 38:2.\n\nNow 4: connected to 8 (0) and 27 (0). So 4 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 4 as 1. Then 10 is connected to 8 (0) and 27 (0). Let's color 10 as 2. 20 is connected to 26 and 27 (0). Let's color 20 as 1. Then 26 is connected to 20 (1), so 26 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 26 as 0.\n\n41 is connected to 16,14,27 (0). 41 can't be 0. Let's see 14 and 16. 14 is connected to 9 (1) and 41. 16 is connected to 9 (1) and 41. Let's color 41 as 2. Then 14 can't be 2 (since 41 is 2) and 14 can't be 1 (since 9 is 1), so 14 must be 0. 16 can't be 2 (since 41 is 2) and 16 can't be 1 (since 9 is 1), so 16 must be 0. That works: 14:0, 16:0, 41:2.\n\nCheck 27's neighbors: 4 (1), 10 (2), 23 (1), 20 (1), 38 (2), 41 (2). All different from 27's color (0). Good.\n\nNode 42 is connected to 9 (1) and 34. 9 is 1, so 42 can be 0 or 2. Let's color 42 as 2. Then 34 is connected to 42 (2) and 19. 34 can't be 2. 34 can be 0 or 1. Let's color 34 as 0. Then 19 is connected to 34 (0), so 19 can be 1 or 2. Let's color 19 as 1.\n\nNode 7 is connected to 0 (0), so 7 can't be 0. 7 was previously colored 1. That's okay.\n\nNode 36 is connected to 0 (0), 18 (0), 29 (0). 36 was colored 1. That's okay.\n\nNode 29 is 0, 36 is 1: okay.\n\nNode 40 is 1, 18 is 0: okay. 40 is connected to 43 (0): okay.\n\nNode 37 is 2, 0 is 0, 18 is 0: okay.\n\nNode 22 is 1, 8 is 0: okay.\n\nNode 5 and 2 are isolated, color them 0.\n\nLet's check all nodes:\n\n0:0 (neighbors 36(1),7(1),37(2)) → okay.\n\n1:0 (neighbors 17(1),13(1)) → okay.\n\n2:0 (no neighbors) → okay.\n\n3:0 (neighbor 44(2)) → okay.\n\n4:1 (neighbors 27(0),8(0)) → okay.\n\n5:0 (no neighbors) → okay.\n\n6:0 (neighbors 21(1),23(1),31(1)) → okay (all 1, 6 is 0).\n\n7:1 (neighbor 0(0)) → okay.\n\n8:0 (neighbors 4(1),35(1),10(2),22(1)) → okay.\n\n9:1 (neighbors 42(2),14(0),16(0),30(0)) → okay.\n\n10:2 (neighbors 27(0),8(0)) → okay.\n\n11:1 (neighbor 12(0)) → okay.\n\n12:0 (neighbors 23(1),32(2),11(1)) → okay.\n\n13:1 (neighbors 32(2),1(0)) → okay.\n\n14:0 (neighbors 9(1),41(2)) → okay.\n\n15:0 (neighbor 17(1)) → okay.\n\n16:0 (neighbors 9(1),41(2)) → okay.\n\n17:1 (neighbors 15(0),1(0)) → okay.\n\n18:0 (neighbors 35(1),37(2),40(1),36(1)) → okay.\n\n19:1 (neighbor 34(0)) → okay.\n\n20:1 (neighbors 26(0),27(0)) → okay.\n\n21:1 (neighbors 6(0),30(0),44(2)) → okay.\n\n22:1 (neighbor 8(0)) → okay.\n\n23:1 (neighbors 6(0),27(0),12(0)) → okay.\n\n24: Wait, node 24 isn't in any edges. Oh right, the nodes are 0-44. Did I miss node 24? Let's check the edges list again. No, 24 isn't mentioned. So node 24 is isolated. Let's color it 0.\n\n25:1 (neighbors 38(2),30(0)) → okay.\n\n26:0 (neighbor 20(1)) → okay.\n\n27:0 (neighbors 4(1),10(2),23(1),20(1),38(2),41(2)) → okay.\n\n28: Also, node 28 isn't in any edges. So 28 is isolated. Color 0.\n\n29:0 (neighbor 36(1)) → okay.\n\n30:0 (neighbors 21(1),25(1),9(1)) → okay.\n\n31:1 (neighbors 44(2),43(0),6(0)) → okay.\n\n32:2 (neighbors 13(1),35(1),12(0)) → okay.\n\n33: Node 33 isn't in any edges. Isolated. Color 0.\n\n34:0 (neighbors 42(2),19(1)) → okay.\n\n35:1 (neighbors 18(0),8(0),32(2)) → okay.\n\n36:1 (neighbors 0(0),18(0),29(0)) → okay.\n\n37:2 (neighbors 0(0),18(0)) → okay.\n\n38:2 (neighbors 25(1),27(0)) → okay.\n\n39: Node 39 isn't in edges. Isolated. Color 0.\n\n40:1 (neighbors 18(0),43(0)) → okay.\n\n41:2 (neighbors 16(0),14(0),27(0)) → okay.\n\n42:2 (neighbors 9(1),34(0)) → okay.\n\n43:0 (neighbors 40(1),31(1)) → okay.\n\n44:2 (neighbors 31(1),21(1),3(0)) → okay.\n\nSo all nodes are colored with 0,1,2, and no adjacent nodes have the same color.

First, I need to check if the graph is bipartite because 2-colorable graphs are exactly bipartite graphs. If it's bipartite, we can split the nodes into two sets with no edges within the same set.\n\nLet me list all the nodes and edges again to visualize:\n\nNodes: 0-13.\n\nEdges:\n2-4, 1-2, 0-10, 6-11, 4-9, 0-6, 0-12, 11-12, 3-13, 5-9, 5-6, 1-6, 7-11, 5-12, 3-11.\n\nLet's start building the bipartition. Let's pick a starting node, say 0. Assign it color 0.\n\nNode 0: color 0.\n\nNeighbors of 0: 10, 6, 12. So they must be color 1.\n\nNode 10: 1.\n\nNode 6: 1.\n\nNode 12: 1.\n\nNow, neighbors of 6 (color 1) are 11, 5, 1, 0 (0 is already 0, which is okay). So 11,5,1 must be color 0.\n\nNode 11: 0.\n\nNode 5: 0.\n\nNode 1: 0.\n\nNeighbors of 1 (color 0) are 2, 6 (6 is 1, okay). So 2 must be color 1.\n\nNode 2: 1.\n\nNeighbors of 2 (color 1) are 4, 1 (1 is 0, okay). So 4 must be color 0.\n\nNode 4: 0.\n\nNeighbors of 4 (color 0) are 2 (1, okay), 9. So 9 must be color 1.\n\nNode 9: 1.\n\nNeighbors of 9 (color 1) are 4 (0, okay), 5 (0, okay). That's good.\n\nNeighbors of 5 (color 0) are 9 (1, okay), 6 (1, okay), 12 (1, okay). 12 is 1, which is different, good.\n\nNeighbors of 12 (color 1) are 0 (0, okay), 11 (0, okay), 5 (0, okay). 11 is 0, good.\n\nNeighbors of 11 (color 0) are 6 (1, okay), 12 (1, okay), 7, 3. So 7 and 3 must be color 1.\n\nNode 7: 1.\n\nNode 3: 1.\n\nNeighbors of 3 (color 1) are 13, 11 (11 is 0, okay). So 13 must be color 0.\n\nNode 13: 0.\n\nNeighbors of 7 (color 1) are 11 (0, okay). No issues.\n\nNeighbors of 10 (color 1) are 0 (0, okay). No issues.\n\nLet's check all edges to make sure no two adjacent nodes have the same color.\n\nCheck 2-4: 2 is 1, 4 is 0. Good.\n\n1-2: 1 is 0, 2 is 1. Good.\n\n0-10: 0 is 0, 10 is 1. Good.\n\n6-11: 6 is 1, 11 is 0. Good.\n\n4-9: 4 is 0, 9 is 1. Good.\n\n0-6: 0 is 0, 6 is 1. Good.\n\n0-12: 0 is 0, 12 is 1.

Good.\n\n5-12: 5 is 0, 12 is 1. Good.\n\n3-11: 3 is 1, 11 is 0. Good.\n\nAll edges are between different colors.
