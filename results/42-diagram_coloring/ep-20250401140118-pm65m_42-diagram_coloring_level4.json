Let me start by understanding the structure of the graph based on the edges provided. First, I'll list out all the edges to see how the nodes are connected. Maybe I should create an adjacency list or something to visualize the connections better.\n\nLooking at the edges, some nodes seem to have multiple connections. For example, node 4 is connected to 6 and 12, also to 5. Node 2 is connected to 5, 11, 26. Hmm. Since it's a graph coloring problem with three colors, I need to assign each node a color such that no adjacent nodes share the same color.\n\nI remember that graph coloring can be approached by checking each node's neighbors and assigning the smallest possible color not used by them. Maybe I can use a greedy algorithm here. But since the user wants exactly three colors, I need to make sure that the graph is 3-colorable. Let's see if there are any obvious cliques of size 4, which would make it impossible, but I don't think so. Let's proceed.\n\nLet me start by ordering the nodes based on their degrees. Nodes with higher degrees might be more constrained, so coloring them first could be better. Let me calculate the degree of each node:\n\n- Node 0: edges with 5 and 25 → degree 2\n- Node 1: Not listed in any edges → degree 0? Wait, the nodes listed are from 0 to 33. Wait, looking at the edges, let's check each node.\n\nWait, actually, the nodes given are 0 through 33. Let me check if all nodes are present. The problem says nodes: 0,1,2,...,33, which are 34 nodes. Now, edges are given for some of them. So some nodes might not be connected at all. For example, node 1 doesn't appear in any edge. So node 1 is isolated. Similarly, maybe nodes like 10, 23, 24, etc. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the edges:\n\nEdges are:\n13-30, 16-32, 4-6, 4-12, 3-16, 20-32, 21-31, 8-9, 0-5, 8-18, 2-5, 5-28, 2-11, 28-33, 19-30, 17-33, 2-26, 25-31, 15-20, 18-19, 4-5, 21-30, 14-15, 9-19, 9-28, 0-25, 8-32, 13-22, 6-16, 16-30, 7-21, 6-22, 6-31, 20-24, 20-27, 11-12, 13-18, 15-18.\n\nWait, let me list all edges properly:\n\n1. 13-30\n2. 16-32\n3. 4-6\n4. 4-12\n5. 3-16\n6. 20-32\n7. 21-31\n8. 8-9\n9. 0-5\n10. 8-18\n11. 2-5\n12. 5-28\n13. 2-11\n14. 28-33\n15. 19-30\n16. 17-33\n17. 2-26\n18. 25-31\n19. 15-20\n20. 18-19\n21. 4-5\n22. 21-30\n23. 14-15\n24. 9-19\n25. 9-28\n26. 0-25\n27. 8-32\n28. 13-22\n29. 6-16\n30. 16-30\n31. 7-21\n32. 6-22\n33. 6-31\n34. 20-24\n35. 20-27\n36. 11-12\n37. 13-18\n38. 15-18\n\nThat's 38 edges. Now, let's note the degree of each node by counting how many times each appears in the edges.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Node 2: appears in edges 11,13,17 → edges 11 (2-5), 13 (2-11), 17 (2-26). So degree 3.\n- Node 5: edges 9 (0-5), 11 (2-5), 12 (5-28), 21 (4-5) → degree 4.\n- Node 6: edges 3 (4-6), 21 (4-5?), no, edge 3 is 4-6, then edge 29 (6-16), 32 (6-22), 33 (6-31). So edges 3,29,32,33 → degree 4.\n- Node 4: edges 3,4,21 → 3 (4-6),4 (4-12),21 (4-5) → degree 3.\n- Node 16: edges 2 (16-32),5 (3-16),29 (6-16),30 (16-30). So edges 2,5,29,30 → degree 4.\n- Node 20: edges 6 (20-32),19 (15-20),34 (20-24),35 (20-27). So edges 6,19,34,35 → degree 4.\n- Node 8: edges 8 (8-9),10 (8-18),27 (8-32). So edges 8,10,27 → degree 3.\n- Node 9: edges8 (8-9),24 (9-19),25 (9-28). So degree 3.\n- Node 13: edges1 (13-30),28 (13-22),37 (13-18). Degree 3.\n- Node 15: edges19 (15-20),23 (14-15),38 (15-18). Degree 3.\n- Node 18: edges10 (8-18),20 (18-19),37 (13-18),38 (15-18). So edges 10,20,37,38 → degree 4.\n- Node 19: edges15 (19-30),20 (18-19),24 (9-19). Degree 3.\n- Node 21: edges7 (21-31),22 (21-30),31 (7-21). Degree 3.\n- Node 25: edges26 (0-25),18 (25-31),25-33. Wait, edge 18 is 25-31, edge 26 is 0-25, edge 25 (9-28?) No, edge 25 is 9-28. Wait, looking back:\n\nEdge 18 is 25-31, edge 26 is 0-25. Then edge 25 (25-33) is from the list: \"25 - 33\"? Let me check again.\n\nWait, original edges list includes \"25 - 31, 15 - 20, 18 - 19, 4 - 5, 21 - 30, 14 - 15, 9 - 19, 9 - 28, 0 - 25, 8 - 32, 13 - 22, 6 - 16, 16 - 30, 7 - 21, 6 - 22, 6 - 31, 20 - 24, 20 - 27, 11 - 12, 13 - 18, 15 - 18\"\n\nAh, in the original list, after \"25 - 31\" comes \"15 - 20\", etc. So the edges for node 25 are 25-31 (edge18), and 0-25 (edge26), and also edge \"25-33\" is part of the edges list. Wait, looking back at the original edges list:\n\n\"Edges (format: NodeA - NodeB):\n13 - 30, 16 - 32, 4 - 6, 4 - 12, 3 - 16, 20 - 32, 21 - 31, 8 - 9, 0 - 5, 8 - 18, 2 - 5, 5 - 28, 2 - 11, 28 - 33, 19 - 30, 17 - 33, 2 - 26, 25 - 31, 15 - 20, 18 - 19, 4 - 5, 21 - 30, 14 - 15, 9 - 19, 9 - 28, 0 - 25, 8 - 32, 13 - 22, 6 - 16, 16 - 30, 7 - 21, 6 - 22, 6 - 31, 20 - 24, 20 - 27, 11 - 12, 13 - 18, 15 - 18\"\n\nAh, the edge \"25 - 33\" is not present. Wait, in the list provided, after \"2 - 26\" comes \"25 - 31\", then \"15 - 20\", etc. So the edge \"28 - 33\" is present (edge14), and \"17 - 33\" (edge16). Also, \"25 - 33\" is listed as part of the edges? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the edges as listed:\n\n- The edges provided are:\n\n13-30, 16-32, 4-6, 4-12, 3-16, 20-32, 21-31, 8-9, 0-5, 8-18, 2-5, 5-28, 2-11, 28-33, 19-30, 17-33, 2-26, 25-31, 15-20, 18-19, 4-5, 21-30, 14-15, 9-19, 9-28, 0-25, 8-32, 13-22, 6-16, 16-30, 7-21, 6-22, 6-31, 20-24, 20-27, 11-12, 13-18, 15-18.\n\nSo, the edges for node 25 are 25-31 (edge18), 0-25 (edge26), and is there another? No, unless I missed any. So node25 has edges to 31, 0. Wait, also, in the list \"25 - 31, 15 - 20, 18 - 19...\" so 25-31 is edge18, and 0-25 is edge26. So node25 is connected to 31, 0. What about edge \"25-33\"? Oh, wait, edge16 is 17-33, edge14 is 28-33. So node25 is connected to 31 and 0. So degree 2 for node25.\n\nSo, back to calculating degrees.\n\nLet me list all nodes and count their degrees:\n\nNode 0: edges 9 (0-5), 26 (0-25) → degree 2.\nNode 1: not in any edge → degree 0.\nNode 2: edges 11 (2-5), 13 (2-11), 17 (2-26) → degree 3.\nNode 3: edge5 (3-16) → degree 1.\nNode 4: edges3 (4-6),4 (4-12),21 (4-5) → degree 3.\nNode5: edges9 (0-5),11 (2-5),12 (5-28),21 (4-5) → degree4.\nNode6: edges3 (4-6),29 (6-16),32 (6-22),33 (6-31) → degree4.\nNode7: edge31 (7-21) → degree1.\nNode8: edges8 (8-9),10 (8-18),27 (8-32) → degree3.\nNode9: edges8 (8-9),24 (9-19),25 (9-28) → degree3.\nNode10: not in any edge → degree0.\nNode11: edges13 (2-11),36 (11-12) → degree2.\nNode12: edges4 (4-12),36 (11-12) → degree2.\nNode13: edges1 (13-30),28 (13-22),37 (13-18) → degree3.\nNode14: edge23 (14-15) → degree1.\nNode15: edges19 (15-20),23 (14-15),38 (15-18) → degree3.\nNode16: edges2 (16-32),5 (3-16),29 (6-16),30 (16-30) → degree4.\nNode17: edge16 (17-33) → degree1.\nNode18: edges10 (8-18),20 (18-19),37 (13-18),38 (15-18) → degree4.\nNode19: edges15 (19-30),20 (18-19),24 (9-19) → degree3.\nNode20: edges6 (20-32),19 (15-20),34 (20-24),35 (20-27) → degree4.\nNode21: edges7 (21-31),22 (21-30),31 (7-21) → degree3.\nNode22: edges28 (13-22),32 (6-22) → degree2.\nNode23: not in any edge? Let's check: in the edges list, I don't see 23 connected. Wait, the nodes go up to 33. So node23 is not connected to anything → degree0.\nNode24: edges34 (20-24) → degree1.\nNode25: edges18 (25-31),26 (0-25) → degree2.\nNode26: edge17 (2-26) → degree1.\nNode27: edge35 (20-27) → degree1.\nNode28: edges12 (5-28),14 (28-33),25 (9-28) → degree3.\nNode29: not in any edge? Wait, node29 is present in the nodes list but in the edges, is there a node29? Let me check. The edges listed include nodes up to 33. For node29, looking through the edges:\n\nEdge14 is 28-33, 16-33, etc. I don't see node29 in any edge. So node29 is degree0.\nNode30: edges1 (13-30),15 (19-30),22 (21-30),30 (16-30) → edges1,15,22,30 → degree4.\nNode31: edges7 (21-31),18 (25-31),33 (6-31) → edges7,18,33 → degree3.\nNode32: edges2 (16-32),6 (20-32),27 (8-32) → degree3.\nNode33: edges14 (28-33),16 (17-33),25-33? Wait, edge14 is 28-33, edge16 is17-33. Wait, original edges list: \"28 - 33, 17 - 33, 2 - 26, 25 - 31, ...\". So node33 is connected to 28,17. So degree2. Wait, but in the problem statement, the edges list includes \"25 - 31, ...\", so node33 is connected to 28 (edge14),17 (edge16). So node33 has degree2.\n\nWait, no, edge14 is 28-33, edge16 is17-33. So node33 is connected to 28,17. Is there any other edge? Like \"25-33\" is not present. So node33's edges are 28-33 and 17-33. So degree2.\n\nSo the highest degree nodes are nodes5,6,16,18,20,30 with degree4. Others have lower degrees.\n\nSo perhaps the graph is 3-colorable. Let's proceed.\n\nI think the approach here would be to assign colors in a way that adjacent nodes have different colors. Let's try to assign colors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list all nodes and their neighbors.\n\nBut this is a bit tedious. Maybe start with nodes that have higher degrees since they are more constrained.\n\nLet's start with node5 (degree4). Assign color0.\n\nThen, node5's neighbors are 0,2,4,28.\n\nSo 0,2,4,28 cannot be color0.\n\nNext, node6 (degree4). Assign color1. Neighbors:4,16,22,31. So these nodes can't be color1.\n\nNode16 (degree4). Assign color2. Neighbors:3,6,32,30. So 3,6,32,30 can't be color2.\n\nNode18 (degree4). Assign color0. Neighbors:8,19,13,15. So 8,19,13,15 can't be color0.\n\nNode20 (degree4). Assign color1. Neighbors:32,15,24,27. So 32,15,24,27 can't be color1.\n\nNode30 (degree4). Assign color0. Neighbors:13,19,21,16. So 13,19,21,16 can't be color0. Wait, but node16 is already assigned color2, which is okay.\n\nBut node30's neighbors are 13,19,21,16. So when we assign color0 to node30, these four nodes can't be 0.\n\nHmm. Let's see. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to order nodes in order of descending degree and assign colors one by one, choosing the first available color not used by their already colored neighbors.\n\nSo let's list the nodes in order of degree (highest first):\n\nDegree4:5,6,16,18,20,30.\n\nThen degree3:2,4,8,9,13,15,19,21,28,31,32.\n\nThen degree2:0,11,12,22,25,33.\n\nDegree1:3,7,14,17,24,26,27.\n\nDegree0:1,10,23,29.\n\nSo starting with the highest degree nodes:\n\n1. Node5 (degree4): assign color0. Neighbors:0,2,4,28.\n\n2. Node6 (degree4): neighbors are4,16,22,31. 4 is a neighbor of5 (color0) but node4 hasn't been colored yet. Assign color1 to node6. Then 4,16,22,31 cannot be color1.\n\n3. Node16 (degree4): neighbors3,6,32,30. Node6 has color1. Assign color0 to node16? Wait, but node6 is color1, so node16 can't be color1. So available colors are 0,2. Let's choose color0. Wait, but node16's neighbor 30 hasn't been colored yet, but we need to check. Wait, no, we're processing node16 now. The only colored neighbor is node6 (color1). So available colors are 0,2. Let's pick color0. So node16 is color0. Then its neighbors 3,32,30 can't be color0.\n\n4. Node18 (degree4): neighbors8,19,13,15. Assign color0. So 8,19,13,15 can't be 0.\n\n5. Node20 (degree4): neighbors32,15,24,27. Assign color1. Then 32,15,24,27 can't be1.\n\n6. Node30 (degree4): neighbors13,19,21,16. Node16 is color0. Assign color1. So 13,19,21 can't be1.\n\nNext, process nodes with degree3:\n\n7. Node2 (degree3): neighbors5 (0),11,26. Assign color1. Since 5 is color0, color1 is allowed. Then neighbors 11 and26 can't be1.\n\n8. Node4 (degree3): neighbors5 (0),6 (1),12. So 5 is color0,6 is color1. So node4 can't be 0 or1, so assign color2.\n\n9. Node8 (degree3): neighbors9,18 (color0),32. Assign color1 (since 18 is color0). Then 9 and32 can't be1.\n\n10. Node9 (degree3): neighbors8 (color1),19,28. Assign color0 (since 8 is color1). Then 19,28 can't be0.\n\n11. Node13 (degree3): neighbors30 (color1),22,18 (color0). So node13 can't be1 or0. Assign color2.\n\n12. Node15 (degree3): neighbors20 (color1),14,18 (color0). Assign color2 (since 20 is1 and 18 is0). So neighbors14, etc.\n\n13. Node19 (degree3): neighbors30 (color1),18 (color0),9 (color0). So can't be0 or1. Assign color2.\n\n14. Node21 (degree3): neighbors30 (color1),31,7. Assign color0 (since 30 is1). So neighbors31 and7 can't be0.\n\n15. Node28 (degree3): neighbors5 (color0),9 (color0),33. Can't be0. Assign color1. Then 33 can't be1.\n\n16. Node31 (degree3): neighbors6 (color1),21 (color0),25. Assign color2. Then neighbors6 is1,21 is0. So color2 is allowed.\n\n17. Node32 (degree3): neighbors16 (color0),20 (color1),8 (color1). Can't be0 or1. Assign color2.\n\nNow, nodes with degree2:\n\n18. Node0: neighbors5 (color0),25. Assign color1. Then 25 can't be1.\n\n19. Node11: neighbors2 (color1),12. Assign color0. Then 12 can't be0.\n\n20. Node12: neighbors4 (color2),11 (color0). Assign color1.\n\n21. Node22: neighbors6 (color1),13 (color2). Assign color0.\n\n22. Node25: neighbors0 (color1),31 (color2). Assign color0. Since 0 is1 and31 is2. So color0 is allowed.\n\n23. Node33: neighbors28 (color1),17. Assign color0 (since 28 is1). Then 17 can't be0.\n\nDegree1 nodes:\n\n24. Node3: neighbor16 (color0). Assign color1.\n\n25. Node7: neighbor21 (color0). Assign color1.\n\n26. Node14: neighbor15 (color2). Assign color0.\n\n27. Node17: neighbor33 (color0). Assign color1.\n\n28. Node24: neighbor20 (color1). Assign color0.\n\n29. Node26: neighbor2 (color1). Assign color0.\n\n30. Node27: neighbor20 (color1). Assign color0.\n\nDegree0 nodes (1,10,23,29): Assign color0 to all, since they have no neighbors. But since the problem says to use exactly 3 colors, but these nodes can be colored with any. However, to use exactly 3 colors, some of them must have different colors. Wait, the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2)\". So the coloring must use all three colors? Wait, no. The problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\" which probably means that the coloring should not use more than 3 colors. But sometimes, exactly 3 might require all three colors to be used. However, the problem's wording says \"using exactly 3 colors\" which is a bit ambiguous. But in graph coloring problems, usually, using exactly k colors means that you use at most k colors, but sometimes it's required to use exactly k (i.e., all colors must be used). However, in the problem statement, the example given in the output includes colors 0 and 1, but the user specified exactly 3. Wait, no, the user's example has '...' implying more entries. Wait, the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2)\". So colors are 0,1,2. So the answer must assign colors 0,1,2 to nodes, such that adjacent nodes have different colors. It's allowed to use all three colors, but maybe the problem allows using fewer as long as not exceeding three. However, the problem says \"exactly 3 colors\", which might mean that all three must be used. But I think the key is that the coloring is valid (no adjacent have same color) and uses no more than 3 colors, which are 0,1,2. But to be safe, I need to ensure that all three colors are used. Because otherwise, if it's possible to color with 2 colors, but the problem says to use exactly 3, then we have to use 3. Wait, no. The question says \"using exactly 3 colors\", which probably means that the coloring uses 3 colors, i.e., at least one node for each color. So the coloring must use all three colors. So in my current assignment, I need to check if all three colors are used.\n\nLooking at the current assignments:\n\nColors used so far:\n\n- Color0: node5,16,18,30,9,15,19,21,22,25,33,14,24,26,27,3,7,0,11, etc. Wait, node0 is color1? Wait, in step18, node0 was assigned color1. Let's track all nodes:\n\nWait, let's re-examine the steps:\n\n1. Node5: color0.\n\n2. Node6: color1.\n\n3. Node16: color0.\n\n4. Node18: color0.\n\n5. Node20: color1.\n\n6. Node30: color1.\n\n7. Node2: color1.\n\n8. Node4: color2.\n\n9. Node8: color1.\n\n10. Node9: color0.\n\n11. Node13: color2.\n\n12. Node15: color2.\n\n13. Node19: color2.\n\n14. Node21: color0.\n\n15. Node28: color1.\n\n16. Node31: color2.\n\n17. Node32: color2.\n\n18. Node0: color1.\n\n19. Node11: color0.\n\n20. Node12: color1.\n\n21. Node22: color0.\n\n22. Node25: color0.\n\n23. Node33: color0.\n\n24. Node3: color1.\n\n25. Node7: color1.\n\n26. Node14: color0.\n\n27. Node17: color1.\n\n28. Node24: color0.\n\n29. Node26: color0.\n\n30. Node27: color0.\n\nSo the colors used:\n\ncolor0: node5,16,18,9,21,22,25,33,14,24,26,27,28, etc. Wait, no:\n\nWait, node5: color0.\n\nnode16: color0.\n\nnode18: color0.\n\nnode9: color0.\n\nnode21: color0.\n\nnode22: color0.\n\nnode25: color0.\n\nnode33: color0.\n\nnode14: color0.\n\nnode24: color0.\n\nnode26: color0.\n\nnode27: color0.\n\nnode28: color1 (step15).\n\nnode15: color2.\n\nnode13: color2.\n\nnode4: color2.\n\nnode31: color2.\n\nnode32: color2.\n\nnode19: color2.\n\nnode15: color2.\n\nOthers:\n\ncolor1: node6,2,8,20,30,0,11,12,3,7,17.\n\ncolor2: node4,13,15,19,31,32, etc.\n\nSo colors 0,1,2 are all used.\n\nSo that's good. Now, the degree0 nodes (1,10,23,29) can be assigned any color. Let's assign color0 to them. But since the problem requires exactly 3 colors, and these nodes are isolated, their colors don't affect the validity. So assign them color0 for simplicity.\n\nSo node1: color0.\n\nnode10: color0.\n\nnode23: color0.\n\nnode29: color0.\n\nNow, check for any conflicts.\n\nLet's check each edge:\n\nFor example, edge0-5: 0 is color1, 5 is color0 → okay.\n\nedge0-25: 0 is1,25 is0 → okay.\n\nedge2-5:2 is1,5 is0 → okay.\n\nedge2-11:2 is1,11 is0 → okay.\n\nedge2-26:2 is1,26 is0 → okay.\n\nedge4-5:4 is2,5 is0 → okay.\n\nedge4-6:4 is2,6 is1 → okay.\n\nedge4-12:4 is2,12 is1 → okay.\n\nedge5-28:5 is0,28 is1 → okay.\n\nedge6-16:6 is1,16 is0 → okay.\n\nedge6-22:6 is1,22 is0 → okay.\n\nedge6-31:6 is1,31 is2 → okay.\n\nedge7-21:7 is1,21 is0 → okay.\n\nedge8-9:8 is1,9 is0 → okay.\n\nedge8-18:8 is1,18 is0 → okay.\n\nedge8-32:8 is1,32 is2 → okay.\n\nedge9-19:9 is0,19 is2 → okay.\n\nedge9-28:9 is0,28 is1 → okay.\n\nedge11-12:11 is0,12 is1 → okay.\n\nedge13-18:13 is2,18 is0 → okay.\n\nedge13-22:13 is2,22 is0 → okay.\n\nedge13-30:13 is2,30 is1 → okay.\n\nedge14-15:14 is0,15 is2 → okay.\n\nedge15-18:15 is2,18 is0 → okay.\n\nedge15-20:15 is2,20 is1 → okay.\n\nedge16-30:16 is0,30 is1 → okay.\n\nedge16-32:16 is0,32 is2 → okay.\n\nedge17-33:17 is1,33 is0 → okay.\n\nedge18-19:18 is0,19 is2 → okay.\n\nedge19-30:19 is2,30 is1 → okay.\n\nedge20-24:20 is1,24 is0 → okay.\n\nedge20-27:20 is1,27 is0 → okay.\n\nedge20-32:20 is1,32 is2 → okay.\n\nedge21-30:21 is0,30 is1 → okay.\n\nedge21-31:21 is0,31 is2 → okay.\n\nedge25-31:25 is0,31 is2 → okay.\n\nedge28-33:28 is1,33 is0 → okay.\n\nedge3-16:3 is1,16 is0 → okay.\n\nedge0-25:0 is1,25 is0 → okay.\n\nnode3 is color1, which is connected to node16 color0 → okay.\n\nnode7 is color1, connected to node21 color0 → okay.\n\nnode14 is color0, connected to node15 color2 → okay.\n\nnode17 is color1, connected to node33 color0 → okay.\n\nnode24 is color0, connected to node20 color1 → okay.\n\nnode26 is color0, connected to node2 color1 → okay.\n\nnode27 is color0, connected to node20 color1 → okay.\n\nAll edges seem to be properly colored. The isolated nodes (1,10,23,29) are color0, which is fine. All three colors are used (nodes like 4,13,15, etc. are color2). So this should be a valid 3-coloring.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0, 1], [1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 2], [5, 0], [6, 1], [7, 1], [8, 1], [9, 0], [10, 0], [11, 0], [12, 1], [13, 2], [14, 0], [15, 2], [16, 0], [17, 1], [18, 0], [19, 2], [20, 1], [21, 0], [22, 0], [23, 0], [24, 0], [25, 0], [26, 0], [27, 0], [28, 1], [29, 0], [30, 1], [31, 2], [32, 2], [33, 0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

Let's start by understanding the structure of the graph. The nodes are from 0 to 17, and there are a bunch of edges listed. My goal is to assign each node a color (0, 1, or 2) such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. \n\nFirst, I should list out all the edges to see the connections. Let me parse each edge pair:\n\n6-12, 7-17, 3-7, 0-17, 2-8, 13-17, 7-16, 3-9, 14-15, 3-15, 8-14, 0-10, 0-13, 13-16, 3-5, 0-9, 0-12, 10-16, 7-11, 6-9, 7-14.\n\nHmm, let me see which nodes are connected. Maybe starting by looking for nodes with high degrees. Let's count how many edges each node has.\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\nNode 0 is connected to 17, 10, 13, 9, 12. So degree 5.\nNode 3 is connected to 7, 9, 15, 5. Degree 4.\nNode 7 is connected to 17, 3, 16, 11, 14. Degree 5.\nNode 13 is connected to 17, 0, 16. Degree 3.\nNode 14 is connected to 15, 8, 7. Degree 3.\nNode 6 is connected to 12, 9. Degree 2.\nNode 8 is connected to 2, 14. Degree 2.\nNode 9 is connected to 3, 6, 0. Degree 3.\nNode 16 is connected to 7, 10, 13. Degree 3.\nNode 17 is connected to 7, 0, 13. Degree 3.\nNode 10 is connected to 0, 16. Degree 2.\nNode 12 is connected to 6, 0. Degree 2.\nNode 15 is connected to 14, 3. Degree 2.\nNode 5 is connected to 3. Degree 1.\nNode 11 is connected to 7. Degree 1.\nNode 2 is connected to 8. Degree 1.\nNode 4 isn't listed in any edges, so degree 0. So node 4 is isolated.\n\nSince node 4 is isolated, it can take any color. Let's assign it color 0 maybe, but since there's no constraint, we can handle it last.\n\nNow, the high-degree nodes are 0, 7, 3. Let's start with node 0. Assign color 0. Then, all its neighbors (17,10,13,9,12) can't be color 0. Let's assign them color 1 or 2. But need to make sure their neighbors also don't conflict.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this step by step, maybe using backtracking or a greedy algorithm. Since it's a 3-coloring problem and the graph isn't too big, maybe a greedy approach with ordering by degree would work.\n\nStart by ordering the nodes in descending order of their degrees. So nodes 0,7,3, then others. Let's try assigning colors in that order.\n\nLet me list the order: 0 (degree 5), 7 (5), 3 (4), 9 (3), 17 (3), 13 (3), 16 (3), 14 (3), 8 (2), 6 (2), 10 (2), 12 (2), 15 (2), 5 (1), 11 (1), 2 (1), 4 (0).\n\nStart with node 0: assign color 0. Then, its neighbors (17,10,13,9,12) cannot be 0.\n\nNext, node 7. Its neighbors are 17,3,16,11,14. Let's check possible colors. Since 7 is connected to 17 (which is a neighbor of 0, which is color 0). So 17 can't be 0. But 7 is not connected to 0. So node 7 can take color 0, unless any of its neighbors already have color 0. But since we're processing in order, 17 hasn't been colored yet. Wait, maybe this approach has a problem. Because in the order, node 7 comes after 0. So when coloring node 7, none of its neighbors except possibly 0 have been colored yet. Wait, node 3 is connected to 7. But node 3 is processed after 7? Wait, our order was 0,7,3. Wait, no, node 7 is processed before node 3. So when assigning color to node 7, the only colored neighbor is possibly none except maybe 0 (if connected). Wait, node 0 and 7 are connected via 0-17? No. 0 is connected to 17, and 7 is connected to 17. So 0 and 17 are connected, and 7 and 17 are connected. But 0 and 7 are not directly connected. So when coloring node 7, the only colored nodes are 0 (color 0), and maybe others. But node 7's neighbors are 17,3,16,11,14. None of those have been colored yet. So assign the smallest possible color not conflicting. Since node 7 is the second node, assign color 0. Wait, but maybe that's allowed. But wait, node 0 is color 0, but node 7 is not connected to 0, so it's okay. So node 7 can be color 0. Then, proceed.\n\nWait, but node 7 is connected to 3, which is next. So when we get to node 3, we need to check node 7's color. So node 3 can't be color 0 if node 7 is 0. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assigning node 0 to color 0, node 7 to color 1. Because if node 7 is color 0, then when we process node 3 (connected to 7), node 3 can't be 0. But maybe that's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to assign node 7 a different color than 0, to prevent conflicts in the future. Let's try that.\n\nSo node 0: color 0.\n\nNode 7: can't be same as its neighbors. But its neighbors are 17,3,16,11,14. None have been colored yet. So assign color 0. Wait, but if node 7 is color 0, then all its neighbors (like 17,3, etc.) can't be 0. Let's proceed.\n\nThen node 3. Connected to 7 (color 0), so node 3 can't be 0. Assign the next available color, say 1.\n\nNow, node 3's neighbors (7,9,15,5). Node 7 is 0, so 3 is 1. Then 9,15,5 can't be 1.\n\nNext node in order is 9. Connected to 3 (color 1) and 6, and 0 (color 0). So node 9 can't be 0 or 1. So color 2.\n\nSo node 9: color 2.\n\nNext, node 17. It's connected to 7 (0), 0 (0), and 13. So node 17 can't be 0. The possible colors are 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Assign node 17 to 1.\n\nThen node 13: connected to 17 (1), 0 (0), and 16. So node 13 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2.\n\nNext node 16: connected to 7 (0), 10, 13 (2). So node 16 can't be 0 or 2. So color 1.\n\nNode 14: connected to 15, 8, 7 (0). So node 14 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nWait, but node 14 is connected to 7 (color 0), so 14 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 1.\n\nBut then node 14's other connections: 15 and 8. If we assign 1 to 14, then 15 and 8 can't be 1.\n\nMoving on to node 8: connected to 2 and 14 (1). So node 8 can't be 1. Assign 0? Let's see. Node 8's neighbor 14 is 1. So node 8 can be 0 or 2. Let's choose 0.\n\nThen node 2: connected to 8 (0). So node 2 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNow node 6: connected to 12 and 9 (2). So node 6 can't be 2. Assign 0 or 1. Let's pick 0. Then node 12, connected to 6 (0) and 0 (0). So node 12 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 10: connected to 0 (0) and 16 (1). So node 10 can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\nNode 12: connected to 6 (0) and 0 (0). So node 12 can't be 0. Assign 1 (as before).\n\nNode 15: connected to 14 (1) and 3 (1). Wait, no. Node 15 is connected to 14 (if node 14 is color 1) and 3 (color 1). So node 15 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. Then node 15 is 0.\n\nNode 5: connected to 3 (1). So node 5 can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\nNode 11: connected to 7 (0). So can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 4: no connections. Assign 0.\n\nNode 14: Wait, I think I assigned node 14 to color 1 earlier. Let's check. Node 14 is connected to 15 (0), 8 (0), and 7 (0). Wait, no. Node 14's neighbors are 15, 8, and 7. When we assigned node 14 to 1, that's okay. Then node 15 can't be 1, so assigned 0. Node 8 is assigned 0, which is okay. So that's correct.\n\nNow let's check for conflicts:\n\n- Node 0 (0) is connected to 17 (1), 10 (2), 13 (2), 9 (2), 12 (1). All different. Good.\n\nNode 7 (0) is connected to 17 (1), 3 (1), 16 (1), 11 (1), 14 (1). Wait, node 7 is color 0, connected to 17 (1), which is okay. But node 3 is color 1, so edge 7-3: 0 and 1, okay. Node 16 is 1, okay. Node 11 is 1, okay. Node 14 is 1, okay. All good.\n\nNode 3 (1) is connected to 7 (0), 9 (2), 15 (0), 5 (0). So all different. Wait, node 15 is 0, but node 3 is 1. That's okay. Yes.\n\nNode 9 (2) connected to 3 (1), 6 (0), 0 (0). All different. Good.\n\nNode 17 (1) connected to 7 (0), 0 (0), 13 (2). All different. Good.\n\nNode 13 (2) connected to 17 (1), 0 (0), 16 (1). All different. Good.\n\nNode 16 (1) connected to 7 (0), 10 (2), 13 (2). All different. Good.\n\nNode 14 (1) connected to 15 (0), 8 (0), 7 (0). All good.\n\nNode 8 (0) connected to 2 (1) and 14 (1). So 8 is 0, 2 is 1, 14 is 1. All different. Good.\n\nNode 6 (0) connected to 12 (1) and 9 (2). All good.\n\nNode 10 (2) connected to 0 (0) and 16 (1). All good.\n\nNode 12 (1) connected to 6 (0) and 0 (0). Good.\n\nNode 15 (0) connected to 14 (1) and 3 (1). All good.\n\nNode 5 (0) connected to 3 (1). Good.\n\nNode 11 (1) connected to 7 (0). Good.\n\nNode 2 (1) connected to 8 (0). Good.\n\nNode 4 (0) no connections. Safe.\n\nWait, but node 14 is color 1, and node 7 is 0. Their connection is okay. Node 14 is connected to 8 (0), which is color 0. Wait, node 14 is 1, 8 is 0. So that's okay. Node 14 and 15: 14 is 1, 15 is 0. Good. Node 14 and 7: 1 and 0. Okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: node 7 is connected to 14 (1), but node 7 is 0. Correct.\n\nCheck node 7-14 edge: 0 vs 1. Correct.\n\nWhat about node 3-15? Node 3 is 1, 15 is 0. Correct.\n\nNode 3-5: 1 vs 0. Correct.\n\nNode 8-14: 0 vs 1. Correct.\n\nNode 0-9: 0 vs 2. Correct.\n\nNode 6-9: 0 vs 2. Correct.\n\nNode 7-11: 0 vs 1. Correct.\n\nNode 0-12: 0 vs 1. Correct.\n\nNode 10-16: 2 vs 1. Correct.\n\nNode 13-16: 2 vs 1. Correct.\n\nNode 0-10: 0 vs 2. Correct.\n\nNode 3-7: 1 vs 0. Correct.\n\nNode 0-17: 0 vs 1. Correct.\n\nNode 7-17: 0 vs 1. Correct.\n\nEdges involving node 14-15: 1 vs 0. Correct.\n\nEdge 3-9: 1 vs 2. Correct.\n\nEdge 7-16: 0 vs 1. Correct.\n\nEdge 8-14: 0 vs 1. Correct.\n\nEdge 13-17: 2 vs 1. Correct.\n\nEdge 7-11: 0 vs 1. Correct.\n\nEdge 14-7: 1 vs 0. Correct.\n\nEdge 6-12: 0 vs 1. Correct.\n\nEdge 0-13: 0 vs 2. Correct.\n\nEdge 3-15: 1 vs 0. Correct.\n\nEdge 2-8: 1 vs 0. Correct.\n\nEdge 7-14: 0 vs 1. Correct.\n\nEdge 10-16: 2 vs 1. Correct.\n\nEdge 0-9: 0 vs 2. Correct.\n\nEdge 3-5: 1 vs 0. Correct.\n\nEdge 6-9: 0 vs 2. Correct.\n\nEdge 13-16: 2 vs 1. Correct.\n\nAll edges seem to have different colors. Great.\n\nNow let's check all nodes are assigned colors. Nodes 0-17. Let's list them:\n\n0: 0\n1: Wait, node 1? Wait, the nodes are 0-17. Wait, in the problem statement, the nodes are 0 through 17. Wait, but in the edges listed, there's no mention of node 1. Node 1 is not connected to anything. So node 1 can be colored any color. Let me check the steps above. Oh! I completely forgot about node 1. Oops. Because when listing the edges, node 1 isn't present. So node 1 is isolated. So in the previous steps, I assigned nodes up to 4, but node 1 was skipped. So I need to assign a color to node 1 as well.\n\nSo in the current assignments, node 1 hasn't been assigned. Since it's isolated, we can assign any color. Let's pick 0. Similarly, node 4 is 0. But node 1 is isolated. So in the final list, node 1 should be included. Let's adjust that.\n\nSo the final coloring would include all 18 nodes (0-17), each assigned a color.

Node 8 is connected to node 2 (1) and node 14 (1). So 0 is correct.\n\nNode 1 and 4 are isolated, so their colors can be 0. So that's okay.\n\nNow, checking all nodes are covered. From 0 to 17:\n\nYes, each is accounted for.\n\nSo the final list in JSON format would be pairs like [[node, color], ...].\n\nSo the answer would be:\n\n[[0,0], [1,0], [2,1], [3,1], [4,0], [5,0], [6,0], [7,0], [8,0], [9,2], [10,2], [11,1], [12,1], [13,2], [14,1], [15,0], [16,1], [17,1]]\n\nBut wait, let's verify all colors are between 0-2. Yes. And no adjacent nodes have the same color.\n\nBut let me check again for node 14 (color 1) connected to node 15 (0) and 7 (0). Correct. Also connected to 8 (0). No conflict.\n\nYes, this seems valid.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0,0],[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[4,0],[5,0],[6,0],[7,0],[8,0],[9,2],[10,2],[11,1],[12,1],[13,2],[14,1],[15,0],[16,1],[17,1]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

Let's start by understanding the structure of the graph. The nodes are from 0 to 12. Let me list out all the edges first to see how the nodes are connected.\n\nEdges:\n9-10, 1-5, 5-8, 0-9, 11-12, 3-9, 10-12, 2-6, 6-10, 4-8, 2-11, 7-8.\n\nHmm, let's try to visualize or group these connections. Maybe start by identifying connected components or look for nodes with higher degrees. \n\nLooking at the edges, node 9 is connected to 10, 0, 3. Node 10 is connected to 9, 12, 6. Node 12 is connected to 11 and 10. Node 8 is connected to 5,4,7. Node 5 is connected to 1 and 8. Node 6 is connected to 2 and 10. Node 11 is connected to 2 and 12. Node 2 is connected to 6 and 11. \n\nOkay, so there's a cluster around nodes 9,10,12,6,2,11,3,0. Then another cluster with 1,5,8,4,7. Let's check if they are connected. Wait, node 8 is connected to 5,4,7. And 5 is connected to 1. So the 1-5-8-4-7 cluster is separate from the other cluster. Then node 3 is connected to 9, which is part of the larger cluster. Wait, node 3 is connected to 9, which is in the first cluster. So maybe the entire graph is connected through node 9. Let me see: 3-9 connects to 0,10. 10 connects to 6, 12. 6 connects to 2, which connects to 11, which connects to 12. So yes, the entire graph is connected. So it's a single connected component.\n\nNow, the task is to assign colors 0,1,2 such that adjacent nodes have different colors. Let's start assigning colors step by step.\n\nMaybe start with node 0. Let's color node 0 with color 0. Then node 9 is connected to 0, so it can't be 0. Let's color node 9 with color 1. Then node 10 is connected to 9 (color 1) so can't be 1. Let's color 10 with 0. But wait, 10 is connected to 12. So 12 can't be 0. 12 is connected to 11 and 10. So if 10 is 0, then 12 could be 1. Then 11 is connected to 12 (1), so 11 can't be 1. Let's say 11 is 0. But 11 is connected to 2. So 2 can't be 0. Let's backtrack a bit. Maybe assign colors in another way.\n\nAlternatively, start with a node and assign colors in a way that conflicts are avoided. Let's pick node 0: color 0. Then node 9 (connected to 0) must be 1 or 2. Let's choose 1. Then node 10 (connected to 9) can't be 1. Let's choose color 0 for 10. Then node 12 (connected to 10) can't be 0. Assign 12 to color 1. Node 11 is connected to 12 (1), so 11 can be 0 or 2. But 11 is also connected to node 2. Let's see. Assign 11 to 0. Then node 2 must not be 0. But node 2 is also connected to 6. Let's see. Node 6 is connected to 10 (0) and 2. So if 6 is colored 1, then 2 can be 2. Hmm.\n\nLet me try this:\n\n0:0\n\nThen 9 connected to 0: color 1.\n\n3 connected to 9: can't be 1. So 3 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNow, node 10 connected to 9 (1). So 10 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 0. Then 12 connected to 10 (0) and 11. 12 can be 1. Then 11 connected to 12 (1) and 2. So 11 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nNow node 2 is connected to 11 (0) and 6. So 2 can't be 0. Let's assign color 1. Then 6 is connected to 2 (1) and 10 (0). So 6 can be 2. \n\nSo 6:2. Then node 10 is 0, node 6 is 2. That's okay. Now, node 6 is 2. Then node 2 is 1. \n\nWait, but node 2 is connected to 11 (0), so 2 can be 1. Then 6 is connected to 2 (1), so 6 can be 0 or 2. Wait, node 10 is 0 and connected to 6. So 6 can't be 0. So 6 is 2. \n\nThat works. So 2:1, 6:2. \n\nNow, node 11 is 0. Then node 12 is 1. \n\nNext, node 5-8 cluster. Let's look at nodes 1-5-8-4-7. \n\nNode 1 is connected to 5. Let's color 1. Assign 1 to color 0. Then node 5 can't be 0. Assign 5 to 1. Then node 8 is connected to 5 (1), so can't be 1. Assign 8 to 0. Then node 4 connected to 8 (0), so assign 4 to 1. Node 7 connected to 8 (0), assign 7 to 1. \n\nWait, but node 8 is 0, connected to 5 (1), 4 (1), and 7 (1). That works. \n\nNow, check all nodes:\n\n0:0\n\n1:0 (connected to 5:1) – okay.\n\n2:1 (connected to 6:2 and 11:0) – okay.\n\n3:0 (connected to 9:1) – okay.\n\n4:1 (connected to 8:0) – okay.\n\n5:1 (connected to 1:0 and 8:0) – okay.\n\n6:2 (connected to 2:1 and 10:0) – okay.\n\n7:1 (connected to 8:0) – okay.\n\n8:0 (connected to 5:1, 4:1, 7:1) – okay.\n\n9:1 (connected to 0:0, 3:0, 10:0) – okay.\n\n10:0 (connected to 9:1, 6:2, 12:1) – okay.\n\n11:0 (connected to 12:1 and 2:1) – okay.\n\n12:1 (connected to 10:0 and 11:0) – okay.\n\nWait, node 12 is connected to 11 (0) and 10 (0). So 12 is 1, which is okay. \n\nNow, check all edges:\n\n9-10: 1 vs 0 – okay.\n\n1-5:0 vs1 – okay.\n\n5-8:1 vs0 – okay.\n\n0-9:0 vs1 – okay.\n\n11-12:0 vs1 – okay.\n\n3-9:0 vs1 – okay.\n\n10-12:0 vs1 – okay.\n\n2-6:1 vs2 – okay.\n\n6-10:2 vs0 – okay.\n\n4-8:1 vs0 – okay.\n\n2-11:1 vs0 – okay.\n\n7-8:1 vs0 – okay.\n\nAll edges are properly colored. Now, check if all nodes are assigned. Let's list all 13 nodes (0-12):\n\n0:0\n\n1:0\n\n2:1\n\n3:0\n\n4:1\n\n5:1\n\n6:2\n\n7:1\n\n8:0\n\n9:1\n\n10:0\n\n11:0\n\n12:1\n\nWait, nodes from 0 to 12 are 13 nodes? Wait the user said nodes 0,1,...,12, which is 13 nodes. But in the problem statement, it lists nodes 0 to 12 inclusive, which is 13 nodes. Let me count the assignments above. Let's list all nodes:\n\n0: yes\n\n1: yes\n\n2: yes\n\n3: yes\n\n4: yes\n\n5: yes\n\n6: yes\n\n7: yes\n\n8: yes\n\n9: yes\n\n10: yes\n\n11: yes\n\n12: yes. So all 13 nodes are accounted for. \n\nBut wait, in the output format example, it's a list like [[0,1],[1,0],...]. So the answer should have all 13 nodes. Let me check again:\n\nNode 0:0\n\n1:0\n\n2:1\n\n3:0\n\n4:1\n\n5:1\n\n6:2\n\n7:1\n\n8:0\n\n9:1\n\n10:0\n\n11:0\n\n12:1\n\nYes, all 13 are present. Colors used are 0,1,2. So exactly 3 colors. But wait, in the example, the user said to use exactly 3 colors, which we did (0,1,2). So this should be a valid coloring. \n\nI think this works. Let me check again for any possible conflicts. For example, node 3 is colored 0, connected to node 9 which is 1 – okay. Node 10 is 0, connected to 6 (2) and 12 (1) – okay. Node 11 is 0 connected to 2 (1) and 12 (1) – okay. Node 7 is 1 connected to 8 (0) – okay. \n\nYes, all edges are satisfied. So the coloring is valid with exactly 3 colors.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 0], [4, 1], [5, 1], [6, 2], [7, 1], [8, 0], [9, 1], [10, 0], [11, 0], [12, 1]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

I need to assign colors to 25 nodes (0 to 24) using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2). The key is to ensure that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. Let's start by understanding the structure of the graph based on the given edges.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges to get a clearer picture. The edges are:\n\n7-17, 18-23, 6-15, 12-16, 12-13, 12-22, 8-15, 2-5, 1-9, 8-21, 0-23, 15-17, 15-20, 21-24, 4-14, 4-17, 4-20, 19-23, 0-19, 11-19, 18-24, 4-7, 6-22, 3-11, 12-20, 1-4, 2-18, 0-24.\n\nHmm, that's a lot. Let's try to visualize or find connections. Maybe grouping nodes by their connections would help. Let's note some key nodes that have multiple connections.\n\nLooking at the edges, node 4 is connected to 1, 7, 14, 17, 20. Node 12 is connected to 13,16,20,22. Node 15 is connected to 6,8,17,20. Node 23 is connected to 0,18,19. Node 18 is connected to 2,23,24. Node 0 is connected to 19,23,24. Node 19 is connected to 0,11,23. Node 8 is connected to 15,21. Node 21 is connected to 8,24. Node 24 is connected to 0,21,18. Node 4 is connected to several nodes, which might make it a central point.\n\nTo assign colors, I should start with nodes that have the highest degree (most connections) first, as they are more constrained. Let's check the degrees:\n\nLooking at the nodes:\n\n- Node 4 has edges to 1,7,14,17,20, and possibly others. Wait, edges listed: 4-14,4-17,4-20,1-4,4-7. So degree 5.\n\n- Node 12: edges to 13,16,20,22. Degree 4.\n\n- Node 15: edges to 6,8,17,20. Degree 4.\n\n- Node 0: edges to 19,23,24. Degree 3.\n\n- Node 18: edges to 2,23,24. Degree 3.\n\n- Node 23: edges to 0,18,19. Degree 3.\n\n- Node 19: edges to 0,11,23. Degree 3.\n\n- Node 8: edges to 15,21. Degree 2.\n\n- Node 21: edges to 8,24. Degree 2.\n\n- Node 24: edges to 0,21,18. Degree 3.\n\n- Node 7: edges to 4,17. Degree 2.\n\n- Node 17: edges to 7,4,15. Degree 3.\n\n- Node 20: edges to 4,12,15. Degree 3.\n\n- Node 22: edges to 6,12. Degree 2.\n\n- Node 6: edges to 15,22. Degree 2.\n\n- Node 15: edges to 6,8,17,20. Degree 4.\n\nSo nodes 4,12,15 have higher degrees. Let's start with node 4. Assign color 0. Then its neighbors (1,7,14,17,20) cannot be 0.\n\nNext, let's look at node 12. Assign color 0? Wait, but if node 4 is color 0, then node 12 can be color 0 unless they are connected. Wait, are node 4 and 12 connected? Let me check the edges: I don't see 4-12. So they can have the same color. But node 12 is connected to 20, which is a neighbor of node 4 (since 4-20). So if 4 is 0, then 20 must be a different color. Then node 12, connected to 20, can't be the same as 20. But node 12's color isn't directly connected to node 4. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nStart with node 4: color 0.\n\nNeighbors of 4: 1,7,14,17,20. These can't be 0.\n\nNow, assign colors to these neighbors. Let's pick node 1. It's connected to 4 (color 0) and 9. Since node 1's color can't be 0, assign it color 1. Then node 9, connected to node 1, can't be color 1.\n\nNext, node 7 (neighbor of 4, color 0). Assign color 1. Then node 17 (connected to 4 and 7). 7 is color 1, 4 is 0. So 17 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2. Then node 15, connected to 17 (color 2). So 15 can't be 2. Also, node 15 is connected to 6,8,17,20.\n\nBut let's handle node 15 later. Let's continue with node 4's neighbors.\n\nNode 14 (connected to 4, color 0). Assign color 1. Then node 20 (connected to 4 (0), 12, and 15. So 20 can't be 0. Let's assign color 1 to 20. Then node 12, connected to 20 (color 1), so 12 can't be 1. Let's assign color 0 to node 12. Then node 12's neighbors: 13,16,20,22. 20 is color 1, so they can't be 0 (if 12 is 0). So 13,16,22 must not be 0.\n\nNow, node 12 is 0. So nodes 13,16,20,22 can't be 0. Node 20 is already 1.\n\nNext, node 15. It's connected to 6,8,17,20. 17 is color 2, 20 is color 1. So node 15 can't be 2 or 1. Assign color 0. Wait, 0 is allowed if none of its neighbors are 0. Let's check: 17 is 2, 20 is 1, 6 and 8 are not yet assigned. Wait, but if 15 is 0, then nodes 6 and 8 connected to 15 can't be 0.\n\nBut node 6's color: node 6 is connected to 15 and 22. If 15 is 0, then 6 can't be 0. Let's proceed.\n\nAssign node 15 color 0. Then node 6 (connected to 15 and 22). 15 is 0, so 6 can't be 0. Let's assign 1. Then node 22 is connected to 6 (1) and 12 (0). So 22 can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\nWait, node 22's neighbors are 6 (1) and 12 (0). So 22 can be 2. That works.\n\nNow, node 8 (connected to 15 (0) and 21). So 8 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Then node 21 (connected to 8 (1) and 24. So 21 can't be 1. Assign 0. Then node 24 is connected to 21 (0), 18, and 0. So 24 can't be 0. Assign 1. Then node 18 is connected to 24 (1), 23, and 2. So 18 can't be 1. Assign 0. But node 18 is connected to 23. Then 23 can't be 0. Assign 1. But node 0 is connected to 23. Node 0's color: let's check. Node 0 is connected to 19, 23, and 24. Let's see:\n\nNode 0's neighbors: 24 is 1, 23 is 1 (if 23 is assigned 1), and 19. So 0 can't be 1. Let's assign 0 to node 0. Then 23 (connected to 0 (0)) can't be 0, so 23 is 1 as before. Node 19 is connected to 0 (0), 11, 23 (1). So 19 can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2. Then node 11 (connected to 19 (2)) can't be 2. Assign 0 or 1. Node 3 is connected to 11. Let's check node 3. Node 3 is connected to 11. If 11 is 0, then 3 can't be 0. Assign 1. Then 11 can be 0. So node 11: 0. Then node 3: 1.\n\nNow, node 2 is connected to 5 and 18 (color 0). So node 2 can't be 0. Assign 1. Then node 5 (connected to 2 (1)) can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 1 (color 1). Assign 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nNode 14 is connected to 4 (0) and assigned color 1 earlier.\n\nNode 16 (connected to 12 (0)). Assign 1 or 2. Let's assign 1.\n\nNode 13 (connected to 12 (0)). Assign 1 or 2.

So, I need to assign colors to each node using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2) such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. Let me start by understanding the structure of the graph based on the edges provided.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges to see which nodes are connected. Let's go through each edge:\n\n- 12-16\n- 5-7\n- 0-2\n- 9-17\n- 9-20\n- 2-8\n- 11-23\n- 10-21\n- 6-8\n- 18-22\n- 12-15\n- 5-9\n- 8-11\n- 2-4\n- 5-24\n- 8-20\n- 2-19\n- 7-15\n- 12-17\n- 3-8\n- 3-23\n- 0-9\n- 0-6\n- 1-7\n- 9-24\n- 16-17\n\nHmm, that's 26 edges. Now, let's try to visualize or note down the connections for each node. Maybe building an adjacency list would help.\n\nStarting with node 0: connected to 2, 9, 6. So nodes 2,9,6 are adjacent to 0.\nNode 1: connected to 7.\nNode 2: connected to 0,8,4,19. Also, edges 2-8, 2-4, 2-19.\nNode3: connected to 8,23.\nNode4: connected to 2.\nNode5: connected to 7,9,24.\nNode6: connected to 8,0.\nNode7: connected to 5,15,1.\nNode8: connected to 2,6,11,20,3. From edges: 2-8,6-8,8-11,8-20,3-8.\nNode9: connected to 17,20,5,24,0. Edges:9-17,9-20,5-9,9-24,0-9.\nNode10: connected to 21.\nNode11: connected to 23,8. From edges 11-23,8-11.\nNode12: connected to 16,15,17. Edges:12-16,12-15,12-17.\nNode13: Hmm, wait, the nodes listed are from 0 to 24. Wait, in the list of edges, I don't see any edges involving node 13, 14, 18, 22? Let me check again. The edges include 18-22. So node18 is connected to 22. Node22 is only connected to 18. Node13 and 14 are not in any edges, so they are isolated? Wait, the nodes are 0-24, so 25 nodes. Let me check all edges again.\n\nWait, the edges include 7-15 (node7 connected to 15), 12-15 (node12 connected to 15). So node15 is connected to 12 and 7. Node16 is connected to 12 and 17 (edges 12-16, 16-17). Node17 is connected to 12,9,16. Node20 is connected to 9,8. Node23 is connected to 11,3. Node24 is connected to 5,9. Nodes 10 and 21 are connected. Nodes 18 and 22 are connected. Nodes 13 and 14 are not mentioned in any edges, so they are isolated. So nodes 13,14 have no edges. So in coloring, they can take any color, but need to make sure that the total number of colors used is exactly 3. Wait, the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\", but that doesn't mean all three colors must be used. Wait, no, the exact wording is \"using exactly 3 colors\", which probably means that the solution must use exactly 3 colors, not fewer. So the coloring must use all three colors. But actually, the problem states \"colors are numbered from 0 to 2\", and the instruction is to use exactly 3 colors. So the answer must assign each node a color from 0,1,2, and no two adjacent nodes have the same color, but the colors used can be all three. However, the problem might not require that all three colors are actually used; perhaps it's allowed to use fewer as long as the maximum allowed is 3. Wait, the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors specified\". Hmm, maybe that's a mistranslation. But in any case, the standard graph coloring allows using up to k colors. So in this case, the answer must use 3 colors, but maybe some nodes can use the same color as long as they aren't adjacent. Wait, no. The standard graph coloring requires that adjacent nodes have different colors, and the colors used can be as few as possible, but here the user is asking to use exactly 3 colors. Wait, the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2)\". So the solution must assign each node a color in 0,1,2. So the colors are 0,1,2, and the answer must use those three. But it's allowed to use all three, but if possible, maybe using two. However, the problem requires \"exactly 3\", perhaps because the graph's chromatic number is 3. Let me check if the graph is 3-colorable. Well, since the problem is asking for a solution with 3 colors, the graph must be 3-colorable. So I need to find a valid 3-coloring.\n\nNow, for the coloring. Let's approach this step by step. Since some nodes are isolated (like 13,14, perhaps), they can be colored with any color. But let's proceed systematically.\n\nLet me start by listing all nodes and their adjacent nodes.\n\nNode 0: connected to 2,9,6\nNode 1: connected to 7\nNode 2: connected to 0,8,4,19\nNode3: connected to 8,23\nNode4: connected to 2\nNode5: connected to7,9,24\nNode6: connected to8,0\nNode7: connected to5,15,1\nNode8: connected to2,6,11,20,3\nNode9: connected to17,20,5,24,0\nNode10: connected to21\nNode11: connected to23,8\nNode12: connected to16,15,17\nNode13: no edges\nNode14: no edges\nNode15: connected to12,7\nNode16: connected to12,17\nNode17: connected to12,9,16\nNode18: connected to22\nNode19: connected to2\nNode20: connected to9,8\nNode21: connected to10\nNode22: connected to18\nNode23: connected to11,3\nNode24: connected to5,9\n\nSo nodes 13 and 14 are isolated. They can be colored with any color. Let's see the rest.\n\nLet's try to assign colors in a way that avoids conflicts. Maybe start with nodes that have higher degrees, as they might be more constrained.\n\nLooking at node8: connected to nodes 2,6,11,20,3. So it has 5 edges. Let's pick a color for node8 first.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to process the nodes in some order, assigning colors as we go. Let's list all nodes and proceed.\n\nLet's start with node0. Let's assign color 0. Then, its neighbors (2,9,6) can't be 0.\n\nNode0: 0\n\nNode1: connected to 7. Let's handle node7 first. Node7 is connected to5,15,1. Suppose node7 is color 0. Then node1 must be different. Wait, perhaps it's better to process in a certain order. Alternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, use a greedy coloring approach: process nodes in order and assign the smallest possible color not used by their neighbors.\n\nLet's try that. Order of nodes: 0 to 24.\n\nStarting with node0: assign color 0. Its neighbors (2,9,6) cannot be 0.\n\nNode0:0\n\nNode1: no processed neighbors yet. Its only neighbor is node7 (unprocessed). Assign the smallest possible, which is 0. Wait, but node1's neighbor is node7. If node1 is assigned 0, then node7 can't be 0. But since node7 hasn't been processed yet, when we get to node7, we need to check its neighbors. Hmm, maybe this approach will work. Let's try.\n\nNode1: assign 0.\n\nNode2: neighbors are 0 (color0), 8,4,19 (none processed yet). So node2 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode2:1\n\nNode3: connected to8 and 23 (unprocessed). Assign smallest possible color, 0.\n\nNode3:0\n\nNode4: connected to2 (color1). Assign 0.\n\nNode4:0\n\nNode5: connected to7,9,24. Let's see: node7 is not processed yet. Assign 0.\n\nNode5:0\n\nNode6: connected to0 (0) and8. Assign 1.\n\nNode6:1\n\nNode7: connected to5 (0),15,1 (0). So can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode7:1\n\nNow, node7's color is 1. Then, node1 (color0) is connected to node7 (color1) – okay.\n\nNode8: connected to2 (1),6 (1), 11,20,3 (0). So neighbors have colors 1,1,0. So available colors: 0 and 1 are taken. So color2.\n\nNode8:2\n\nNode9: connected to0 (0),5 (0), 17,20,24. So can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode9:1\n\nNode10: connected to21. Assign 0.\n\nNode10:0\n\nNode11: connected to8 (2),23. Assign 0.\n\nNode11:0\n\nNode12: connected to16,15,17. Assign 0.\n\nNode12:0\n\nNode13: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNode13:0\n\nNode14: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNode14:0\n\nNode15: connected to12 (0),7 (1). Assign 2.\n\nNode15:2\n\nNode16: connected to12 (0),17. Assign 1.\n\nNode16:1\n\nNode17: connected to12 (0),9 (1),16 (1). Assign 2.\n\nNode17:2\n\nNode18: connected to22. Assign 0.\n\nNode18:0\n\nNode19: connected to2 (1). Assign 0.\n\nNode19:0\n\nNode20: connected to9 (1),8 (2). Assign 0.\n\nNode20:0\n\nNode21: connected to10 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode21:1\n\nNode22: connected to18 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode22:1\n\nNode23: connected to11 (0),3 (0). So cannot be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode23:1\n\nNode24: connected to5 (0),9 (1). Assign 2.\n\nNode24:2\n\nNow, check for conflicts. Let's verify each node's color with their neighbors.\n\nNode0:0. Neighbors 2 (1),9 (1),6 (1). Okay.\n\nNode1:0. Neighbor 7 (1). Okay.\n\nNode2:1. Neighbors 0 (0),8 (2),4 (0),19 (0). Okay.\n\nNode3:0. Neighbors 8 (2),23 (1). Okay.\n\nNode4:0. Neighbor 2 (1). Okay.\n\nNode5:0. Neighbors 7 (1),9 (1),24 (2). Wait, node5 is color0. Node7 is color1: okay. Node9 is color1: okay. Node24 is color2: okay.\n\nNode6:1. Neighbors 0 (0),8 (2). Okay.\n\nNode7:1. Neighbors5 (0),15 (2),1 (0). Okay.\n\nNode8:2. Neighbors2 (1),6 (1),11 (0),20 (0),3 (0). All different. Okay.\n\nNode9:1. Neighbors17 (2),20 (0),5 (0),24 (2),0 (0). Wait, node9 is connected to 17 (color2), 20 (0),5 (0),24 (2),0 (0). So color1 is okay.\n\nNode10:0. Neighbor21 (1). Okay.\n\nNode11:0. Neighbors23 (1),8 (2). Okay.\n\nNode12:0. Neighbors16 (1),15 (2),17 (2). All different. Okay.\n\nNode13:0. No neighbors.\n\nNode14:0. No neighbors.\n\nNode15:2. Neighbors12 (0),7 (1). Okay.\n\nNode16:1. Neighbors12 (0),17 (2). Okay.\n\nNode17:2. Neighbors12 (0),9 (1),16 (1). Okay.\n\nNode18:0. Neighbor22 (1). Okay.\n\nNode19:0. Neighbor2 (1). Okay.\n\nNode20:0. Neighbors9 (1),8 (2). Okay.\n\nNode21:1. Neighbor10 (0). Okay.\n\nNode22:1. Neighbor18 (0). Okay.\n\nNode23:1. Neighbors11 (0),3 (0). Okay.\n\nNode24:2. Neighbors5 (0),9 (1). Okay.\n\nLooks like all nodes are colored without conflicts. Now, check if exactly 3 colors are used. The colors assigned are 0,1,2. Yes, all three are used. For example, node8 uses 2, node15 uses 2, node17 uses 2, node24 uses 2. So colors 0,1,2 are all present.\n\nBut wait, the isolated nodes 13 and 14 are colored 0, which is allowed. So the coloring meets the requirements.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be the list of [node, color] pairs as assigned above.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0,0],[1,0],[2,1],[3,0],[4,0],[5,0],[6,1],[7,1],[8,2],[9,1],[10,0],[11,0],[12,0],[13,0],[14,0],[15,2],[16,1],[17,2],[18,0],[19,0],[20,0],[21,1],[22,1],[23,1],[24,2]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

The edges are listed, so I should parse them carefully.\n\nLet me start by listing all the edges to see the connections. Maybe I can group nodes by their connections. Let's go through each edge pair:\n\n7-23, 15-30, 11-45, 3-10, 4-21, 6-36, 20-44, 0-8, 19-21, 10-18, 34-43, 22-47, 19-30, 0-38, 30-45, 33-41, 44-47, 43-45, 11-44, 4-8, 10-48, 26-35, 15-41, 12-24, 23-24, 9-10, 17-26, 0-13, 37-38, 12-39, 2-28, 1-29, 0-37, 24-34, 13-40, 3-11, 4-16, 13-46, 12-20, 23-26, 10-13, 7-48, 0-15, 19-22, 8-28, 1-16, 11-24, 11-30, 1-19, 1-25.\n\nHmm, that's a lot. Let's see if there's any pattern or nodes that are highly connected. For example, node 11 is connected to 45, 44, 24, 30, 3. That's several edges. Similarly, node 0 is connected to 8, 38, 13, 37, 15. So these nodes might need careful coloring.\n\nSince we need exactly 3 colors, I can try to assign colors in a way that no two connected nodes have the same color. Let's start by picking a node and assigning a color, then check its neighbors.\n\nLet's start with node 0. Assign color 0. Then, node 0's neighbors are 8, 38, 13, 37, 15. So all these nodes can't be color 0.\n\nNext, look at node 8. It's connected to 0 (color 0) and 4, 28. Assign color 1 to node 8. Then node 4's neighbors are 21, 8, 16. So node 4 can't be color 1 (since 8 is color 1). Let's assign color 0 to node 4. But wait, node 4 is connected to 8 (color1) and 21. Wait, node 4's edges are 4-21 and 4-8, 4-16. So node 4 is connected to 8 (color1), 21 (unknown), 16 (unknown). So if I assign color 0 to node4, that's okay as long as 21 and 16 aren't color0. But I need to check other connections.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to process nodes in order and assign the first available color that's not used by their neighbors. Let's list all nodes and track their colors as we go.\n\nBut since the graph might have cycles or complex connections, I need a systematic way. Maybe using a graph coloring algorithm approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for nodes that are connected to many others. Node 11 has several edges. Let's assign color 0 to node11. Then its neighbors (45,44,24,30,3) cannot be color0.\n\nNode45 is connected to 11 (0), 30 (connected to 11), 43. So node45's color can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 1. Then node43, connected to 45 (1) and 34. Assign 0 to node43 if possible. Wait, node34 is connected to 24 and 43. If node43 is color0, then node34 can be 1 if not conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a graph and perform a backtracking search, but since this is for an answer, I need to find a valid 3-coloring manually.\n\nAlternatively, check if the graph is 3-colorable. Since the problem states to provide a valid scheme, it's possible. Let's proceed.\n\nLet me try to assign colors in a way that alternates colors for connected nodes. Let's pick a starting node, say node0: color0.\n\nThen, node0's neighbors: 8,38,13,37,15. Let's assign these color1.\n\nNow, for each of these neighbors, their neighbors must not be color1.\n\nTake node8: color1. Its neighbors are 0 (0), 4, 28. So 4 and 28 can't be 1. Assign them color0 or 2.\n\nBut node4 is connected to 21, 8 (1), and 16. Assign color0 to node4. Then node21, connected to 4 (0), 19. So node21 can't be 0. Assign color1. Then node19 is connected to 21 (1), 30, 22. So node19 can't be 1. Assign color0.\n\nBut node19 is also connected to 22 and 30. Let's see. Node19 is color0. Then, node22 (connected to 19) can't be 0. Assign 1. Node22 is also connected to 47. So node47 can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\nNow, node47 is connected to 44 (from edge 44-47). So node44 can't be 0. Assign 1. Node44 is connected to 20,47 (0), 11 (0). Wait, node44 is connected to 20 (from edge 20-44). So node20's color can't be 1 if node44 is 1. Let's see. Node20 is connected to 44 (1) and 12. Assign color0 to node20. Then node12 is connected to 24, 39, 20 (0). So node12 can't be 0. Assign 1. Node24 is connected to 12 (1), 23, 34, 11 (0). So node24's neighbors: 12 (1), 23, 34, 11 (0). Assign color2 to node24. Then node23 is connected to 7, 24 (2), 26. Assign color0 to node23. Node23's neighbors: 7, 24 (2), 26. So 7 can be 1, node26 connected to 23 (0), 17, 35. Assign node26 color1. Then node17 is connected to 26 (1), assign color0. Node35 connected to 26 (1), assign color0.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should create a table of nodes and their colors step by step, checking each edge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a greedy algorithm approach. Assign colors to nodes in some order, and for each node, choose the smallest color that's not used by its already-colored neighbors.\n\nLet's try that. Let's order the nodes in numerical order: 0,1,2,...48.\n\nStart with node0: color0.\n\nNode1: connected to 29,16,19,25. Not colored yet. Assign color0. Wait, but node1 is connected to 16,19, etc. Wait, maybe not. Let's process nodes in order.\n\nWait, node1's edges are 1-29, 1-16, 1-19, 1-25. When we get to node1, check its neighbors. If none are colored yet, assign color0. But if some are colored, pick the first available color.\n\nBut since we're processing in order, perhaps better to process from 0 to 48, and for each node, check already processed neighbors (lower-numbered nodes) and assign a color different from them.\n\nWait, but some higher-numbered nodes may be connected to lower ones. For example, node1 has edges to node16 (which is 16), which is higher than 1. So if I process in order 0,1,2,..., when I get to node1, node16 hasn't been processed yet. So for a greedy approach, processing in order may not work because neighbors may not have been colored yet. Alternatively, maybe the graph is such that processing in order allows for a valid coloring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to process nodes in the order of their degree (most connected first). Let's see the degree of each node.\n\nBut calculating the degree for each node would take time. Let's see some nodes:\n\nNode0: edges to 8,38,13,37,15, and 0-15. Wait, in the edge list, node0 is connected to 8,38,13,37,15 (edges: 0-8, 0-38, 0-13, 0-37, 0-15). So node0 has 5 edges.\n\nNode1: connected to 29,16,19,25, and also 1-16, 1-19, 1-25. Wait, the edges for node1 are 1-29, 1-16, 1-19, 1-25. So 4 edges.\n\nNode4: connected to 21,8,16 (edges:4-21, 4-8, 4-16). So 3 edges.\n\nNode10: connected to 3, 18, 48, 9, 13. From edges 3-10, 10-18, 10-48, 9-10, 10-13. So 5 edges.\n\nNode11: connected to 45,44,24,30,3,11-44, etc. Edges:11-45, 11-44, 3-11, 11-24, 11-30. So 5 edges.\n\nNode12: connected to 24,39,20. Edges:12-24, 12-39, 12-20. 3 edges.\n\nNode13: connected to 0,40,46,10,7. Edges:0-13, 13-40, 13-46, 10-13, 7-48 (no, wait: 7-48 is separate. For node13's edges: 0-13, 10-13, 13-40, 13-46. So 4 edges.\n\nNode15: connected to 30,41,0. Edges:15-30, 15-41, 0-15. 3 edges.\n\nNode19: connected to 21,30,22,1. Edges:19-21, 19-30, 19-22, 1-19. So 4 edges.\n\nNode23: connected to 7,24,26. Edges:7-23, 23-24, 23-26. 3 edges.\n\nNode24: connected to 12,23,34,11. Edges:12-24,23-24,24-34,11-24. 4 edges.\n\nNode30: connected to 15,45,19,11. Edges:15-30,30-45,19-30,11-30. So 4 edges.\n\nNode44: connected to 20,47,11,43. Edges:20-44,44-47,11-44,43-45? Wait, no, 44's edges are 20-44, 44-47, 11-44, 43-45? Wait, looking back: the edges include 44-47 and 43-45. So node44 is connected to 20,47,11,43. Wait, 43-45 is an edge between 43 and 45, not involving 44. So node44's edges: 20-44,44-47,11-44, and any others? Wait, the edges listed are:\n\n7-23, 15-30, 11-45, 3-10, 4-21, 6-36, 20-44, 0-8, 19-21, 10-18, 34-43, 22-47, 19-30, 0-38, 30-45, 33-41, 44-47, 43-45, 11-44, 4-8, 10-48, 26-35, 15-41, 12-24, 23-24, 9-10, 17-26, 0-13, 37-38, 12-39, 2-28, 1-29, 0-37, 24-34, 13-40, 3-11, 4-16, 13-46, 12-20, 23-26, 10-13, 7-48, 0-15, 19-22, 8-28, 1-16, 11-24, 11-30, 1-19, 1-25.\n\nSo node44 is connected to 20 (edge 20-44), 47 (44-47), 11 (11-44). So three edges. And maybe others? Let me check all edges again. Another edge involving 44 is 43-45. No, that's between 43 and 45. So node44 has edges with 20,47,11. Also, 44-47 is listed, so that's correct.\n\nSo, perhaps processing nodes in order of their degrees. But since this is time-consuming, maybe a better approach is to proceed step by step and assign colors while keeping track.\n\nLet me try the greedy approach:\n\nStart with node0: color0.\n\nThen node1: its neighbors (29,16,19,25) haven't been colored yet. Assign color0. But wait, when processing node1, the only neighbors that may have been processed are those with lower numbers. But 1's neighbors are 29,16,19,25—all higher than 1. So when processing node1 first, assign color0.\n\nWait, but node1's edge with node19. When processing node1, node19 hasn't been processed yet. So node1's color is assigned 0, and node19, when processed later, will have to check node1's color.\n\nBut this might cause conflicts. For example, if node1 is color0, and then node19 is connected to node1, then node19 can't be 0. But in the greedy approach, when processing node19, we check already colored neighbors. So if node1 is colored 0, then node19 can't be 0. But when processing node1 first, assigning color0, then node19 later will have to choose a different color.\n\nBut perhaps this will work.\n\nProceeding:\n\nnode0: color0.\n\nnode1: neighbors 29,16,19,25 (all higher). Assign color0.\n\nnode2: connected to 28. Assign color0. But when node2 is processed, node28 hasn't been processed yet. So color0 is assigned. But node28 is connected to 8 and 2. When node8 is processed, if it's color0, then node28 can't be color0. But node8 is processed after node2. So maybe this will create a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order of processing affects the coloring. So the greedy approach might not work if nodes are processed in numerical order. Maybe we need a different order.\n\nAlternatively, let's process nodes in the order of their edges, starting from those with high degree. Let's list the nodes and their degrees:\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Alternatively, let's proceed with the initial approach, but adjust where conflicts are found.\n\nProceeding:\n\nnode0: color0.\n\nnode1: color0.\n\nnode2: color0. But node2 is connected to 28. So when node28 is processed, it can't be color0. So node28's color will be 1 or 2.\n\nnode3: connected to 10 and 11. Assign the smallest available color not used by neighbors. Node3's neighbors are 10 and 11. If those nodes are unprocessed, assign color0. So node3: color0.\n\nWait, but node3 is connected to 10 and 11. If node10 and 11 haven't been processed yet, then node3 can be color0. But when node10 and 11 are processed, they'll need to check node3's color.\n\nnode4: connected to 21,8,16. If node8 is processed after node4, but node4 is processed before 8. So assign color0 to node4. Then node8, when processed, can't be color0 if connected to node4.\n\nBut node8 is connected to node0 (color0) and node4 (color0). So node8 must be a different color. When processing node8, its neighbors 0 and 4 are already color0. So node8's color must be 1.\n\nProceeding:\n\nnode0: 0\n\nnode1:0\n\nnode2:0\n\nnode3:0\n\nnode4:0 (but connected to node8, which will be processed later)\n\nnode5: no edges listed. Wait, check the edge list. The nodes are up to 48. But in the edges given, I don't see node5 connected to anyone. So node5 can be colored 0.\n\nWait, looking back at the edges, the edges provided are:\n\n7 - 23, 15 - 30, 11 - 45, 3 - 10, 4 - 21, 6 - 36, 20 - 44, 0 - 8, 19 - 21, 10 - 18, 34 - 43, 22 - 47, 19 - 30, 0 - 38, 30 - 45, 33 - 41, 44 - 47, 43 - 45, 11 - 44, 4 - 8, 10 - 48, 26 - 35, 15 - 41, 12 - 24, 23 - 24, 9 - 10, 17 - 26, 0 - 13, 37 - 38, 12 - 39, 2 - 28, 1 - 29, 0 - 37, 24 - 34, 13 - 40, 3 - 11, 4 - 16, 13 - 46, 12 - 20, 23 - 26, 10 - 13, 7 - 48, 0 - 15, 19 - 22, 8 - 28, 1 - 16, 11 - 24, 11 - 30, 1 - 19, 1 - 25.\n\nLooking for node5 in any edge: no. So node5 has no edges. So it can be colored 0,1, or 2. So assign color0.\n\nSimilarly, node5: color0.\n\nnode6: connected to 36. So when processed, assign color0. Then node36 must be different color.\n\nProceeding:\n\nnode5:0\n\nnode6:0\n\nnode7: connected to 23 and 48. Assign color0. Then node23 and 48 will need different colors.\n\nnode7:0\n\nnode8: connected to 0 (0), 4 (0), and 28. So node8 must be a different color. Assign color1.\n\nnode8:1\n\nnode9: connected to 10. Assign color0.\n\nnode9:0\n\nnode10: connected to 3 (0), 18, 48 (node7's connection?), 9 (0), 13 (processed later?), 7 (node7 is color0). So node10's neighbors include 3 (0), 9 (0), and 7 (0). So node10 can't be 0. Assign color1.\n\nnode10:1\n\nnode11: connected to 45,44,3 (0),24,30. Assign color1 (since 3 is 0). But check if any neighbors have color1. But 45,44, etc., are unprocessed. So node11:1.\n\nnode12: connected to 24,39,20. Assign color0.\n\nnode12:0\n\nnode13: connected to 0 (0), 40,46,10 (1). So neighbors 0 (0) and 10 (1). So node13 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color2.\n\nnode13:2\n\nnode14: no edges? Check edges again. The edges provided don't mention node14. So node14 is isolated. Assign color0.\n\nnode14:0\n\nnode15: connected to 30,41,0 (0). So node15 can't be 0. Assign color1.\n\nnode15:1\n\nnode16: connected to 4 (0),1 (0). So node16 can't be 0. Assign color1.\n\nnode16:1\n\nnode17: connected to 26. Assign color0.\n\nnode17:0\n\nnode18: connected to 10 (1). Assign color0.\n\nnode18:0\n\nnode19: connected to 21,30,22,1 (0). So node19 can't be 0. Assign color1.\n\nnode19:1\n\nnode20: connected to 44,12 (0). So node20 can't be 0. Assign color1.\n\nnode20:1\n\nnode21: connected to 4 (0),19 (1). So node21 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color2.\n\nnode21:2\n\nnode22: connected to 47,19 (1). Assign color0.\n\nnode22:0\n\nnode23: connected to 7 (0),24,26. Node23 can't be 0. Assign color1.\n\nnode23:1\n\nnode24: connected to 12 (0),23 (1),34,11 (1). So node24 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color2.\n\nnode24:2\n\nnode25: connected to 1 (0). Assign color1.\n\nnode25:1\n\nnode26: connected to 23 (1),17 (0),35. So node26 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color2.\n\nnode26:2\n\nnode27: no edges? Assign color0.\n\nnode27:0\n\nnode28: connected to 8 (1),2 (0). So node28 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color2.\n\nnode28:2\n\nnode29: connected to 1 (0). Assign color1.\n\nnode29:1\n\nnode30: connected to 15 (1),45,19 (1),11 (1). So node30 can't be 1. Assign color0 or 2. Let's assign 0. Check conflicts: node30's neighbors include 15 (1),45 (unprocessed),19 (1),11 (1). So node30:0.\n\nnode30:0\n\nnode31: no edges. Assign color0.\n\nnode31:0\n\nnode32: no edges. Assign color0.\n\nnode32:0\n\nnode33: connected to41. Assign color0.\n\nnode33:0\n\nnode34: connected to24 (2),43. Assign color0 (since 24 is 2, and 43 is unprocessed). So node34:0.\n\nnode34:0\n\nnode35: connected to26 (2). Assign color0.\n\nnode35:0\n\nnode36: connected to6 (0). Assign color1.\n\nnode36:1\n\nnode37: connected to0 (0),38. So node37 can't be 0. Assign color1.\n\nnode37:1\n\nnode38: connected to0 (0),37 (1). So node38 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color2.\n\nnode38:2\n\nnode39: connected to12 (0). Assign color1.\n\nnode39:1\n\nnode40: connected to13 (2). Assign color0.\n\nnode40:0\n\nnode41: connected to15 (1),33 (0). Assign color2.\n\nnode41:2\n\nnode42: no edges.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the graph. There are 46 nodes, numbered from 0 to 45, and a bunch of edges. The challenge is to assign each node a color (0, 1, or 2) such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. \n\nFirst, maybe I should list out all the edges and see which nodes are connected. That might help me figure out which nodes are in the same neighborhood. Let's go through the edges and note the connections. \n\nLooking at the edges, some nodes have multiple connections. For example, node 12 is connected to 19, 31, 37, 33, 36, 26, 44, etc. So node 12 has a lot of edges. That means the color chosen for node 12 has to be different from all its neighbors. Similarly, node 5 is connected to 7, 31, 21, 27. So node 5's color must differ from those nodes.\n\nHmm. Maybe starting with the nodes that have the highest degree (most connections) would be a good approach. Because those are the ones that are more constrained. Let me try to figure out the degrees. Let me make a list of each node and count how many edges they have.\n\nBut that might take a while. Alternatively, maybe I can look for nodes mentioned multiple times in the edge list. Let me try to count:\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\n24 is connected to 30, 33, 18, 44. So degree 4.\n12 connects to 19, 31, 37, 33, 36, 26, 44, 0, 12 (wait, no, 0-12 is an edge, so 12 is connected to 0, 19,31,37,33,36,26,44. So degree 8? Let me check:\n\nOriginal edges involving 12:\n12 - 19, 12 -31, 12-37, 12-33, 12-36, 12-26, 12-44, 0-12. Wait, the edge list includes \"0 - 12\" as part of \"0 -9, 0-12\". So yes, 12 is connected to 0 as well. So 12's edges are: 0,19,31,37,33,36,26,44. That's 8 edges. So node 12 has degree 8. That's high. So node 12 is a high-degree node. \n\nSimilarly, node 5 has edges with 7,31,21,27. So degree 4.\n\nNode 23 is connected to 40, 30, 26, 41. Also, 23-40, 19-23, 23-26, 23-41. So four edges. So degree 4.\n\nSo maybe starting with node 12. Assign it color 0. Then all its neighbors (0,19,31,37,33,36,26,44) can't be 0. Then assign colors to those nodes.\n\nBut maybe using a greedy coloring approach. Assign colors in order, picking the first available color that isn't used by adjacent nodes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a graph structure and then applying a backtracking algorithm, but that's time-consuming. Since this is a problem-solving scenario, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to group the nodes.\n\nAlternatively, check if the graph is 3-colorable. Since the problem states to provide a valid coloring with exactly 3 colors, it's assumed possible.\n\nAlternatively, look for cliques (complete subgraphs). If there's a clique of size 3, then each node in the clique needs different colors.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to proceed step by step, assigning colors while keeping track of adjacent nodes.\n\nLet me try to approach this step by step. Start by assigning color 0 to node 12. Then, its neighbors (0,19,31,37,33,36,26,44) can't be 0.\n\nFor example:\n\nNode 12: 0\n\nNow, assign color to node 0 (connected to 12 and 9). Since 12 is 0, node 0 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Then node 9, connected to 0, can't be 1. So node 9 gets 0 or 2. Wait, but node 9's other connections? Let me check. The edges involving 9 are only 0-9. So node 9's only neighbor is 0 (color 1). So node 9 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nProceeding to other nodes connected to 12. Let's pick node 19, connected to 12 (0) and 27. Assign color 1 to node 19. Then node 27 (connected to 19 and 5, 11). Node 27 can't be 1. Then when we get to node 27, we need to assign a color different from its neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this approach is too tedious. Let me think of a better way.\n\nAlternatively, use a graph coloring algorithm. Since the graph might be structured in a certain way, perhaps bipartitioning isn't possible (since it's 3 colors). But since it's 3-colorable, maybe there's a way to split the graph into three color groups.\n\nAlternatively, try to identify cycles. Odd-length cycles require 3 colors. For example, a triangle (3-node cycle) requires 3 colors. Let's see if there are any triangles in the edges.\n\nLooking for triangles:\n\nCheck if any three nodes are connected in a cycle. For example, 12-33-44. 12 is connected to 33 and 44. Are 33 and 44 connected? Let's see. 33-44 is an edge (from edges: 24-33, 33-44). So yes, 33 and 44 are connected. So nodes 12,33,44 form a triangle. Because 12 is connected to 33 and 44, and 33 is connected to 44. So that's a triangle. Therefore, each of these three nodes must have different colors.\n\nSo 12,33,44 form a triangle. Therefore, each must be a different color. Let's assign:\n\n12: 0\n\n33:1\n\n44:2\n\nBut wait, 44 is connected to 12 (0), so 44 can't be 0. 33 is connected to 12 (0) and 44 (2). So 33 can't be 0 or 2. So 33 must be 1. Then 44 is connected to 12 (0) and 33 (1), so 44 can be 2. That works.\n\nSo 12:0, 33:1, 44:2.\n\nNow, proceeding to other nodes connected to these. For example, node 24 is connected to 30,33,18, etc. So node 24 is connected to 33 (1), so it can't be 1. Assign color 0 or 2.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to process each node in order and assign the first available color that doesn't conflict with already colored neighbors. Let's list all the nodes and their adjacent nodes, then assign colors.\n\nLet's list all nodes from 0 to 45. Then, for each node, list all their neighbors based on the edges given.\n\nBuilding adjacency list:\n\n0: connected to 9, 12\n1: connected to 20, 32, 10\n2: connected to 16,6\n3: connected to 31\n4: No edges? Wait, the nodes go up to 45. Wait, the edge list doesn't include any edges for node 4? Let me check the edges again. The edges listed are from the problem statement. Let me scan through the edges to see if any mention node 4.\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\nEdges listed are:\n\n24-30, 8-43, 24-33, 32-43, 35-42, 12-19, 5-7, 7-38, 12-31, 12-37, 23-40, 3-31, 5-31, 37-42, 19-27, 17-42, 16-28, 32-36, 33-44, 13-38, 35-44, 15-38, 18-40, 23-30, 6-44, 12-33, 5-21, 22-37, 8-14, 12-36, 19-23, 5-27, 2-16, 1-20, 41-44, 1-32, 18-24, 16-42, 12-26, 23-26, 0-9, 6-43, 39-43, 21-41, 0-12, 2-6, 17-31, 23-41, 1-10, 12-44, 11-27.\n\nNode 4 is not mentioned in any edge. So node 4 has no edges. Therefore, it can be colored with any color. Similarly, other nodes not in the edge list (like node 4, maybe others?) can be colored arbitrarily. Wait, let's check all nodes from 0 to 45 to see if any are missing.\n\nThe edges given are for a graph with nodes 0-45. Let me check if all nodes are covered in the edges. For example:\n\nLooking at the edges, node 4 isn't present in any of them. So node 4 has no edges. Similarly, other nodes like 25, 29, etc. Wait, let's check:\n\nNodes in edges (from the list):\n\n0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,26,27,28,30,31,32,33,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44.\n\nSo nodes missing from edges are: 4, 25, 29, 34, 45? Wait, node 45 is in the edge list. Let's see: the edge list includes 41-44, but 44 is there. Wait, the nodes listed in the problem's Nodes are 0 through 45. So nodes 0-45. Let me check if any are missing in the edges.\n\nWait, looking at the edges:\n\nEdges like 24-30, 8-43, etc. Let's check the presence of each node from 0 to 45.\n\nNodes 0: yes (edges 0-9, 0-12)\n1: yes (edges 1-20,1-32,1-10)\n2: yes (2-16, 2-6)\n3: yes (3-31)\n4: no\n5: yes (5-7,5-31,5-21,5-27)\n6: yes (6-44,6-43,2-6)\n7: yes (5-7,7-38)\n8: yes (8-43,8-14)\n9: yes (0-9)\n10: yes (1-10)\n11: yes (11-27)\n12: yes (many)\n13: yes (13-38)\n14: yes (8-14)\n15: yes (15-38)\n16: yes (16-28, 2-16,16-42)\n17: yes (17-42,17-31)\n18: yes (18-40,18-24)\n19: yes (12-19,19-27,19-23)\n20: yes (1-20)\n21: yes (5-21,21-41)\n22: yes (22-37)\n23: yes (23-40,19-23,23-26,23-41)\n24: yes (24-30,24-33,18-24)\n25: no (not in any edge)\n26: yes (12-26,23-26)\n27: yes (19-27,5-27,11-27)\n28: yes (16-28)\n29: no (not in any edge)\n30: yes (24-30,23-30)\n31: yes (12-31,3-31,5-31,17-31)\n32: yes (32-43,1-32,32-36)\n33: yes (24-33,12-33,33-44)\n34: no (not in any edge)\n35: yes (35-42,35-44)\n36: yes (32-36,12-36)\n37: yes (12-37,37-42,22-37)\n38: yes (7-38,13-38,15-38)\n39: yes (39-43)\n40: yes (23-40,18-40)\n41: yes (23-41,21-41,41-44)\n42: yes (35-42,37-42,17-42,16-42)\n43: yes (8-43,32-43,6-43,39-43)\n44: yes (33-44,35-44,12-44,41-44,6-44)\n45: Wait, the problem lists nodes up to 45. But in the edges, the highest node is 44. Wait, the problem statement says \"Nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 45\". So nodes 0-45, which is 46 nodes. But the edges only go up to node 44. So node 45 is not connected to any other node. Therefore, node 45 has no edges and can be colored with any color. Similarly, nodes 4,25,29,34 are isolated.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For nodes with no edges, assign any color (since they don't affect others). For example, assign 0.\n\nBut the problem requires exactly 3 colors. But the presence of isolated nodes allows us to assign any color. So the coloring will use all three colors if possible. But since isolated nodes can be any color, perhaps the rest of the graph can be colored with 3 colors, and the isolated nodes can be assigned 0,1,2 arbitrarily.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that all three colors must be used. The instruction is to use exactly 3 colors, which means that the coloring can't use more than 3. But since we can use all three, but isolated nodes can be colored with any.\n\nBut the problem says 'using exactly 3 colors', so the solution must not use more than three. So the answer is valid as long as each node is assigned 0,1, or 2, and adjacent nodes have different colors. Isolated nodes can be assigned any of the three.\n\nSo the main challenge is the connected nodes. Let's focus on those.\n\nFirst, process all connected nodes, then handle the isolated ones.\n\nNow, going back to the adjacency list. For each connected node, assign a color different from its already colored neighbors.\n\nBut without knowing the order in which to process the nodes, maybe a better approach is to use a graph coloring algorithm. Let's consider the graph's structure.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps proceed step by step:\n\nStart with node 12 (high degree). Assign color 0. Then its neighbors (0,19,31,37,33,36,26,44) cannot be 0.\n\nProcess these neighbors:\n\n0: connected to 12 (0) and 9. Assign color 1. Then 9, connected to 0 (1), can be 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\n19: connected to 12 (0) and 27, 23. Assign color 1. Then 27's neighbors are 19 (1), 5, 11. Assign color 0 or 2. When we process 27, need to avoid 1.\n\n31: connected to 12 (0),3,5,17. Assign color 1. Then 3,5,17 cannot be 1.\n\n37: connected to 12 (0), 42, 22. Assign color 1. Then 42's neighbors include 35,37,17,16. So when processing 42, it can't be 1.\n\n33: connected to 12 (0),24,44. Assign color 1. Then 24's neighbors are 30,33 (1), 18. Assign color 0 or 2.\n\n36: connected to 12 (0),32. Assign color 1. Then 32's neighbors are 43,1,36 (1). Assign color 0 or 2.\n\n26: connected to 12 (0),23. Assign color 1. Then 23's neighbors are 40,19 (1),26 (1),41. Assign color 0 or 2.\n\n44: connected to 12 (0),33 (1),35,6,41. Assign color 2. So 44's color is 2. Then 35's neighbors are 42,44 (2). Assign 0 or 1. 6's neighbors are 44 (2),43,2. Assign 0 or 1. 41's neighbors are 23,21,44 (2). Assign 0 or 1.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to proceed systematically.\n\nLet me create a list of nodes and track their colors. Start with node 12 as 0.\n\nThen process each neighbor of 12:\n\n0: neighbors are 12 (0) and 9. Assign 1. So 0=1.\n\n9: only connected to 0 (1). Assign 0.\n\n19: connected to 12 (0), 27, 23. Assign 1.\n\n27: connected to 19 (1), 5, 11. Let's assign 0. Then 5 and 11 can't be 0.\n\n5: connected to 7,31,21,27 (0). So 5 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\n31: connected to 12 (0),3,5 (1),17. So 31 can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\n3: connected to 31 (2). Assign 0.\n\n17: connected to 31 (2),42. Assign 0.\n\n42: connected to 35,37 (1),17 (0),16. Assign 2.\n\n35: connected to 42 (2),44 (2). So 35 can't be 2. Assign 0.\n\n44: connected to 12 (0),33 (1),35 (0),6,41. Assign 2. So 44=2.\n\n6: connected to 44 (2),43,2. Assign 0.\n\n43: connected to 8,32,6 (0),39. Assign 1.\n\n39: connected to 43 (1). Assign 0.\n\n32: connected to 43 (1),1,36. Assign 0.\n\n36: connected to 12 (0),32 (0). Assign 1.\n\nSo 36=1.\n\n26: connected to 12 (0),23. Assign 1.\n\n23: connected to 40,19 (1),26 (1),41. Assign 0.\n\n40: connected to 23 (0),18. Assign 1.\n\n18: connected to 24,40 (1). Assign 0.\n\n24: connected to 30,33 (1),18 (0). Assign 2.\n\n30: connected to 24 (2),23 (0). Assign 1.\n\n33: connected to 12 (0),24 (2),44 (2). Assign 1.\n\nWait, but earlier we assigned 33 to 1 because of 12 and 44. Yes.\n\nThen 33=1.\n\nNow, 37: connected to 12 (0),42 (2),22. Assign 1.\n\n22: connected to 37 (1). Assign 0.\n\n37=1, so 22=0.\n\nNext, 7: connected to 5 (1),38. Assign 0.\n\n38: connected to 7 (0),13,15. Assign 1.\n\n13: connected to 38 (1). Assign 0.\n\n15: connected to 38 (1). Assign 0.\n\nNow, 16: connected to 2,28,42 (2). Assign 0 or 1.\n\nBut 42 is 2. 16's neighbors are 2,28,42.\n\n16: assign 0.\n\n28: connected to 16 (0). Assign 1.\n\n2: connected to 16 (0),6 (0). So 2 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nBut 6 is 0, so 2=1 is okay.\n\nThen 6 is 0. So 2=1.\n\nProceeding to node 1: connected to 20,32 (0),10. Assign 1.\n\n20: connected to 1 (1). Assign 0.\n\n10: connected to 1 (1). Assign 0.\n\nNode 21: connected to 5 (1),41. Assign 0.\n\n41: connected to 21 (0),23 (0),44 (2). Assign 1.\n\nNow, node 8: connected to 43 (1),14. Assign 0.\n\n14: connected to 8 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode 4: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNode 25: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNode 29: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNode 34: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNode 45: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNow, check for any conflicts.\n\nFor example, node 5 is 1. It's connected to 7 (0),31 (2),21 (0),27 (0). No conflicts.\n\nNode 31 is 2. Connected to 12 (0),3 (0),5 (1),17 (0). So no conflicts.\n\nNode 17 is 0. Connected to 31 (2),42 (2). No conflict.\n\nNode 42 is 2. Connected to 35 (0),37 (1),17 (0),16 (0). All okay.\n\nNode 23 is 0. Connected to 40 (1),19 (1),26 (1),41 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 41 is 1. Connected to 23 (0),21 (0),44 (2). All different.\n\nNode 24 is 2. Connected to 30 (1),33 (1),18 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 18 is 0. Connected to 24 (2),40 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 40 is 1. Connected to 23 (0),18 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 22 is 0. Connected to 37 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 37 is 1. Connected to 12 (0),42 (2),22 (0).

Connected to 44 (2),43 (1),2 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 43 is 1. Connected to 8 (0),32 (0),6 (0),39 (0). All different.\n\nNode 32 is 0. Connected to 43 (1),1 (1),36 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 36 is 1. Connected to 12 (0),32 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 0 is 1. Connected to 9 (0),12 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 9 is 0. Connected to 0 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 1 is 1. Connected to 20 (0),32 (0),10 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 20 is 0. Connected to 1 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 10 is 0. Connected to 1 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 21 is 0. Connected to 5 (1),41 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 26 is 1. Connected to 12 (0),23 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 8 is 0. Connected to 43 (1),14 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 14 is 1. Connected to 8 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 39 is 0. Connected to 43 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 11 is connected to 27 (0). Assign 1 (since 27 is 0).\n\nNode 27 is 0. Connected to 19 (1),5 (1),11 (1). Assign 0. Wait, 19 is 1, so 27 can be 0. Then 11 is connected to 27 (0). Assign 1.\n\nYes. That should be okay.\n\nNow, node 11: connected to 27 (0). Assign 1. No conflicts.\n\nIsolated nodes 4,25,29,34,45: assigned 0.\n\nNow, check for any remaining nodes. Let's list all nodes again to ensure none are missed.\n\nNodes 0-45:\n\n0: 1\n1:1\n2:1\n3:0\n4:0\n5:1\n6:0\n7:0\n8:0\n9:0\n10:0\n11:1\n12:0\n13:0\n14:1\n15:0\n16:0\n17:0\n18:0\n19:1\n20:0\n21:0\n22:0\n23:0\n24:2\n25:0\n26:1\n27:0\n28:1\n29:0\n30:1\n31:2\n32:0\n33:1\n34:0\n35:0\n36:1\n37:1\n38:1\n39:0\n40:1\n41:1\n42:2\n43:1\n44:2\n45:0\n\nWait, node 34 is assigned 0, correct. Node 45 is 0. Node 25 is 0. Node 29 is 0. All isolated nodes are assigned 0.\n\nLet me check for any adjacent nodes with the same color.\n\nFor example, node 24 (2) is connected to 30 (1) and 33 (1), and 18 (0). All different.\n\nNode 30 (1) is connected to 24 (2) and 23 (0). Good.\n\nNode 33 (1) is connected to 12 (0),24 (2),44 (2). All good.\n\nNode 44 (2) connected to 12 (0),33 (1),35 (0),6 (0),41 (1).

Let me start by understanding the structure. Let's list out all the nodes and edges first. The nodes are from 0 to 29. The edges are given in pairs. Hmm, I should probably make a list of all edges to visualize the connections better.\n\nLet me go through each edge and note which nodes are connected. For example, 6-15 means node 6 is connected to 15, so they can't have the same color. Similarly, 16-29, 7-20, etc. I need to make sure that adjacent nodes have different colors.\n\nSince the problem requires exactly 3 colors, I need to assign colors 0, 1, or 2 to each node such that no two connected nodes share the same color. \n\nMaybe a good approach is to start by looking at nodes with the highest degrees first because they might be more constrained. Let me count how many edges each node has. \n\nLet's list out all edges:\n\nEdges:\n6-15,\n16-29,\n7-20,\n18-20,\n17-21,\n4-27,\n1-6,\n9-17,\n1-18,\n13-17,\n6-20,\n3-18,\n12-18,\n4-17,\n1-2,\n9-13,\n17-26,\n2-7,\n2-13,\n1-17,\n1-26,\n3-5,\n3-11,\n21-26,\n12-20,\n17-22,\n1-7,\n2-18,\n1-19,\n13-24.\n\nNow let's count how many times each node appears in the edges to find the degree:\n\nNode 1: connected to 6, 18, 2, 17, 26, 7, 19. That's 7 edges. So degree 7.\nNode 2: connected to 1, 7, 13, 18. Degree 4.\nNode 3: connected to 18, 5, 11. Degree 3.\nNode 4: connected to 27, 17. Degree 2.\nNode 5: connected to 3.

Degree 1.\nNodes 0,8,10,14,23,25,28: Not listed in edges. So degree 0.\n\nWait, the nodes in the problem are from 0 to 29, but some like 0, 8, etc., aren't in any edges. So these are isolated nodes. Since they're not connected to anything, they can be colored with any color. But the problem says to use exactly 3 colors, but maybe \"exactly\" here means that we can't use more than 3. So those isolated nodes can be colored with 0, 1, or 2. But since they don't affect any other nodes, perhaps we can assign them color 0 for simplicity.\n\nSo the high-degree nodes are 1 and 17, each with 7 edges. Let's start with node 1. Assign color 0. Then, all its neighbors (nodes 6, 18, 2, 17, 26, 7, 19) must not be color 0.\n\nThen, node 17 is another high-degree node. Since node 17 is connected to node 1 (color 0), it can't be 0. Let's assign color 1 to node 17. Now, its neighbors (21, 9, 4, 26, 22, 1 (already 0), 13) can't be 1.\n\nNow proceed to color their neighbors. Let's tackle node 1's neighbors first. Let's look at node 2 (connected to 1 (0)). Assign color 1. Then node 2 is connected to 7, 13, 18. So 7,13,18 can't be 1.\n\nNode 7 is connected to 1 (0), 2 (1), and 20. So node 7 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2. Then node 20 (connected to 7 (2)) can't be 2.\n\nNode 18 is connected to 1 (0), 20, 3, 12, 2 (1). So node 18's color can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2. Now, node 20 is connected to 7 (2) and 18 (2), so 20 can't be 2. Also connected to 6 and 12. Let's see, 6 is connected to 1 (0) and 15. So node 6 can't be 0. Let's assign node 6 color 1. Then node 15 connected to 6 must not be 1.\n\nNode 20 can't be 2, so assign color 0. Because 20 is also connected to 12 (which is connected to 18 (2)), so 12 can't be 2. Let's assign 12 color 0. But 12 is connected to 18 (2), so 12 can be 0 or 1. Wait, 18 is 2, so 12 can be 0,1. Since 12 is connected to 20 (0), 12 can't be 0. So assign 12 color 1. Wait, but node 12 is connected to 18 (2) and 20 (0). So 12's color can't be 2. So possible colors are 0 and 1. But if 12 is connected to 20 (0), then 12 can't be 0. So assign 12 color 1. Then 20 is 0. Let me confirm:\n\nnode 12 is connected to 18 (color 2) and 20 (color 0). So 12 can be 1. Yes.\n\nSo node 12 is 1. Then node 20 is 0. Node 6 is 1. Node 15 connected to 6 (1) can be 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nMoving on. Node 2 is color 1. Then node 13 is connected to 2 (1), so can't be 1. Also, node 13 is connected to 17 (1) which is color 1. Wait, node 17 is color 1? Wait earlier I assigned node 17 to color 1. But node 13 is connected to 17 (1), so 13 can't be 1. So node 13 can be 0 or 2. Also, node 13 is connected to 9 and 24. Let's assign node 13 color 0. Then node 9 (connected to 17 (1) and 13 (0)) can't be 1 or 0. So node 9 is color 2. Then node 24, connected to 13 (0), can be 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode 4 is connected to 17 (1) and 27. So node 4 can't be 1. Assign color 0. Then node 27 connected to 4 (0) can be 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode 26 is connected to 17 (1), 1 (0), and 21. So node 26 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2. Then node 21 connected to 17 (1) and 26 (2) can't be 1 or 2. Assign color 0. Node 22 connected to 17 (1) can be 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nNode 19 connected to 1 (0) can be 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode 3 is connected to 18 (2) and 5, 11. So node 3 can't be 2. Assign color 0. Then nodes 5 and 11 connected to 3 (0) can be 1 or 2. Assign 1 to both.\n\nNodes 16 and 29 are connected. Node 16 can be 0, then 29 can be 1.\n\nNodes 0,8,10,14,23,25,28, etc. Are these all the nodes not mentioned in edges? Let's check. The nodes given in the problem are 0-29. The edges don't include any of 0,8,10,14,23,25,28. So those are isolated. Assign them color 0.\n\nWait, let me list all nodes and see which are in edges:\n\nIn edges: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,12,13,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,24,26,27,29.\n\nSo nodes not in edges are 0,8,10,11,14,23,25,28, but wait node 11 is in edges (3-11). So nodes not in edges:\n\n0,8,10,14,23,25,28.\n\nWait node 3 is connected to 5,11,18. So 5 and 11 are in edges. So the nodes not in edges are 0,8,10,14,23,25,28. So these can be colored any color. Let's assign them 0.\n\nNow, let's check for any conflicts.\n\nLet me go through each edge and ensure connected nodes have different colors.\n\nFor example:\n\n6-15: node6 is color 1, node15 is 0. OK.\n\n16-29: node16 is 0, node29 is 1. Wait, no. Wait I thought node16 is connected to 29. Earlier I said node16 is color 0, 29 is 1. Yes, that's fine.\n\n7-20: 7 is 2, 20 is 0. OK.\n\n18-20: 18 is 2, 20 is 0. OK.\n\n17-21:17 is1, 21 is0. OK.\n\n4-27:4 is0, 27 is1. OK.\n\n1-6:1 is0,6 is1. OK.\n\n9-17:9 is2,17 is1. OK.\n\n1-18:1 is0,18 is2. OK.\n\n13-17:13 is0,17 is1. OK.\n\n6-20:6 is1,20 is0. OK.\n\n3-18:3 is0,18 is2. OK.\n\n12-18:12 is1,18 is2. OK.\n\n4-17:4 is0,17 is1. OK.\n\n1-2:1 is0,2 is1. OK.\n\n9-13:9 is2,13 is0. OK.\n\n17-26:17 is1,26 is2. OK.\n\n2-7:2 is1,7 is2. OK.\n\n2-13:2 is1,13 is0. OK.\n\n1-17:1 is0,17 is1. OK.\n\n1-26:1 is0,26 is2. OK.\n\n3-5:3 is0,5 is1. OK.\n\n3-11:3 is0,11 is1. OK.\n\n21-26:21 is0,26 is2. OK.\n\n12-20:12 is1,20 is0. OK.\n\n17-22:17 is1,22 is0. OK.\n\n1-7:1 is0,7 is2. OK.\n\n2-18:2 is1,18 is2. OK.\n\n1-19:1 is0,19 is1. OK.\n\n13-24:13 is0,24 is1. OK.\n\nAll edges checked. Seems okay. The isolated nodes can be colored 0. Let's confirm the colors for all nodes:\n\nNode 0: 0\n\nNode1:0\n\nNode2:1\n\nNode3:0\n\nNode4:0\n\nNode5:1\n\nNode6:1\n\nNode7:2\n\nNode8:0\n\nNode9:2\n\nNode10:0\n\nNode11:1\n\nNode12:1\n\nNode13:0\n\nNode14:0\n\nNode15:0\n\nNode16:0\n\nNode17:1\n\nNode18:2\n\nNode19:1\n\nNode20:0\n\nNode21:0\n\nNode22:0\n\nNode23:0\n\nNode24:1\n\nNode25:0\n\nNode26:2\n\nNode27:1\n\nNode28:0\n\nNode29:1\n\nWait, node29: connected to 16 (color0). So node29 is 1. Correct.\n\nYes, all edges are satisfied. All adjacent nodes have different colors. The isolated nodes (0,8,10,14,23,25,28) are assigned 0, which is fine. Now, let's check if any nodes are missing. The nodes are from 0 to 29. Let's list all:\n\n0:0\n\n1:0\n\n2:1\n\n3:0\n\n4:0\n\n5:1\n\n6:1\n\n7:2\n\n8:0\n\n9:2\n\n10:0\n\n11:1\n\n12:1\n\n13:0\n\n14:0\n\n15:0\n\n16:0\n\n17:1\n\n18:2\n\n19:1\n\n20:0\n\n21:0\n\n22:0\n\n23:0\n\n24:1\n\n25:0\n\n26:2\n\n27:1\n\n28:0\n\n29:1\n\nYes, all 30 nodes are accounted for. Now, check if exactly 3 colors are used. The colors used are 0,1,2. Yes. So this should be a valid coloring.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 1], [6, 1], [7, 2], [8, 0], [9, 2], [10, 0], [11, 1], [12, 1], [13, 0], [14, 0], [15, 0], [16, 0], [17, 1], [18, 2], [19, 1], [20, 0], [21, 0], [22, 0], [23, 0], [24, 1], [25, 0], [26, 2], [27, 1], [28, 0], [29, 1]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

So, the goal is to assign colors to each node such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color, and we have to use exactly 3 colors. The colors are numbered 0, 1, and 2. \n\nFirst, I need to process the graph information given. Let me list out all the edges to understand the connections between the nodes. The nodes are from 0 to 23. The edges are:\n\n6-18, 16-20, 4-12, 12-19, 0-14, 2-17, 7-22, 12-15, 14-15, 3-21, 1-2, 0-22, 6-16, 7-15, 4-7, 6-22, 3-8, 12-23, 12-20, 4-19, 8-16, 2-12, 1-10, 2-15, 13-15.\n\nHmm. Let's start by building the adjacency list for each node. That might help visualize which nodes are connected. Let me note down each connection:\n\nNode 0 is connected to 14 and 22.\nNode 1 is connected to 2 and 10.\nNode 2 is connected to 1, 12, 17, 15. (From edges 1-2, 2-12, 2-17, 2-15)\nWait, let me check all edges again:\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\n- 0-14\n- 0-22\n- 1-2\n- 1-10\n- 2-17\n- 2-12\n- 2-15\n- 3-21\n- 3-8\n- 4-12\n- 4-7\n- 4-19\n- 6-18\n- 6-16\n- 6-22\n- 7-22\n- 7-15\n- 4-7 (already noted)\n- 8-16\n- 12-19\n- 12-15\n- 12-20\n- 12-23\n- 13-15\n- 14-15\n- 16-20\n- 8-16 (again from 3-8 and 8-16)\n- 12-20 (from both 4-12 and 12-20)\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list each node's neighbors. Let's do that step by step.\n\nNode 0: 14, 22\nNode 1: 2, 10\nNode 2: 1, 17, 12, 15\nNode 3: 21, 8\nNode 4: 12, 7, 19\nNode 5: (no edges listed)\nWait, the list of edges includes nodes up to 23, but the problem statement says the nodes are 0-23. So all 24 nodes are present. But some nodes may not have edges, like node 5, 9, 11, etc. So they can be colored with any color since they have no neighbors.\n\nBut let's confirm. Wait, the problem says \"Edges (format: NodeA - NodeB):\" followed by the list. So for example, node 5 is not mentioned in any edge. So node 5 is isolated. Similarly, node 9, 11, etc. So those can be colored with any color, but since we need exactly 3 colors, maybe using color 0 for them is okay.\n\nBut the main challenge is to color the connected nodes properly. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, to create a valid coloring with 3 colors. Let's start by handling the connected components.\n\nLet's first look at the nodes with edges and see if there's any structure that can be colored systematically.\n\nFirst, let's note that some nodes are connected in a way that might form a cycle or a structure that requires 3 colors. For example, if there's a triangle (3-node cycle), that would require 3 colors. But I need to check if such structures exist here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's possible to color the graph with 2 colors, but since the problem requires exactly 3, I need to use all three even if some parts could be done with fewer. Wait, no. The problem says \"exactly 3 colors\", which I think means that the solution must use all three colors. But no, in graph coloring, the term \"exactly 3 colors\" might mean that the graph is 3-colorable and we have to use at most 3 colors. However, the problem here specifies \"using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2)\". Wait, the way the question is phrased: \"using exactly 3 colors\" might mean that we need to assign colors from 0,1,2, but not necessarily use all three. However, the problem says \"exactly 3 colors specified\" and the colors are 0-2. So perhaps the solution just needs to use colors in 0,1,2, and use as few as possible. But since the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\", perhaps the solution must use all three. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Wait the exact question says: \"Provide a valid coloring scheme for the graph using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2).\" So here, exactly 3 colors in the sense that colors available are 3, and you can't use more than that. But the answer can use any number of colors as long as it's at most 3. However, the problem might require that you must use all three colors, but that's not standard. For example, a graph that's bipartite (2-colorable) can be colored with 2 colors, but if the problem says \"use exactly 3\", perhaps the answer must use all three. But the standard graph coloring would just require that the coloring is valid and uses at most the given number of colors. So maybe the problem here is just asking for a 3-coloring, which is a coloring that uses at most 3 colors. So perhaps it's acceptable if some colors aren't used, as long as it's valid. But the wording says \"exactly 3 colors specified\", which might mean that the available colors are exactly 3 (0,1,2). So the solution must use colors from those three, but can use any of them. So maybe some nodes can be colored with 0, others with 1 and 2, but the total used can be any subset of {0,1,2}. But the problem states \"using exactly 3 colors\", so maybe it's required to use all three. Wait, perhaps the problem wants the solution to use all three colors. Because otherwise, why specify \"exactly\". Hmm. Let me recheck the problem statement. The user says: \"Provide a valid coloring scheme for the graph using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2). The coloring scheme should be a list of pairs [node, color] for each node.\" So \"exactly 3 colors\" probably refers to the color set being 0,1,2. So the answer can use any combination of those, as long as no two adjacent nodes share the same color. So the solution may use 1, 2, or all 3 colors, but not more than 3. But the problem says \"exactly 3\", which might mean that the available colors are exactly three, and you have to use those. But in standard terminology, using exactly 3 colors would mean that the chromatic number is 3, and you have to use all three. However, the question might just be that the solution must not use more than 3 colors, but can use fewer. So perhaps in this case, it's possible that the graph is 2-colorable, but the problem requires using 3 colors. Wait, but the question says \"using exactly 3 colors\" which I think is intended to mean that the solution must use at most 3 colors. Because otherwise, if the graph is 2-colorable, but the problem requires using exactly 3, then that's impossible. So probably, the problem is using \"exactly 3\" to mean \"at most 3\", i.e., the colors are 0,1,2 and you can't use any others. So the answer should use colors from 0,1,2, and assign them such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. That's the main point.\n\nSo, the task is to assign each node a color from 0,1, or 2, such that adjacent nodes have different colors. Now, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nOne approach is to pick an order of the nodes and assign the smallest possible color that's not used by their neighbors. Alternatively, since some nodes are isolated, they can be colored with 0. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, list all nodes and their adjacent nodes:\n\nNode 0: 14,22\nNode 1: 2,10\nNode 2: 1,17,12,15\nNode 3: 21,8\nNode 4: 12,7,19\nNode 5: (no edges)\nNode 6: 18,16,22\nNode 7: 22,15,4\nNode 8: 3,16\nNode 9: (no edges)\nNode 10: 1\nNode 11: (no edges)\nNode 12: 4,19,15,20,23,2\nNode 13: 15\nNode 14: 0,15\nNode 15: 12,14,7,2,13, (from edges 12-15, 14-15, 7-15, 2-15, 13-15)\nNode 16: 6,20,8\nNode 17: 2\nNode 18:6\nNode 19:12,4\nNode 20:12,16\nNode 21:3\nNode 22:0,6,7\nNode 23:12\n\nNow, let's start by coloring the nodes. Let's process nodes in order from 0 to 23, but perhaps starting with the more connected ones might help avoid conflicts.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to find an order where we can color each node based on the already colored neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for any cliques or structures that require 3 colors.\n\nFor example, if there's a triangle (three nodes all connected to each other), that would require 3 colors. Let's check if any such exists.\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\nCheck node 2's neighbors: 1,17,12,15. None of these nodes are connected to each other (except 12 and 15? Let's check if 12 and 15 are connected. Yes: edge 12-15. So 2 is connected to both 12 and 15, and 12 is connected to 15. So nodes 2,12,15 form a triangle. Because 2 is connected to 12, 12 is connected to 15, and 15 is connected to 2. Wait, 2 is connected to 15 via edge 2-15. So 2-12-15-2: that's a triangle. So the nodes 2,12,15 form a triangle, which is a 3-node clique. Therefore, each of these three nodes must have different colors. So their colors must be 0,1,2 in some order. This means that we need to assign three different colors to these three nodes. So that's a key point.\n\nTherefore, in any valid 3-coloring, nodes 2,12,15 must each have distinct colors.\n\nSo let's start by assigning colors to these three nodes. Let's pick:\n\n- Node 2: color 0\n- Node 12: color 1\n- Node 15: color 2\n\nBut we can choose any permutation. Let's proceed with this.\n\nNow, node 2 is color 0. Its neighbors are 1,17,12,15. So 1 and 17 can't be 0. But 12 is 1 and 15 is 2. So node 1's color can't be 0 (since it's adjacent to node 2 which is 0). Similarly, node 17's color can't be 0. But node 17 is only connected to node 2, so it can be colored 1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly, node 12 is color 1. Its neighbors are 4,19,15 (color 2),20,23,2 (color 0). So neighbors of 12 must not be 1. So nodes 4,19,20,23 must not be color 1. Also, node 12's color is 1, so those adjacent to it can't be 1.\n\nNode 15 is color 2. Its neighbors are 12 (1), 14,7,2 (0),13. So nodes 14,7,13 must not be color 2.\n\nNow, let's proceed to color other nodes.\n\nStarting with node 0. Node 0 is connected to 14 and 22. Let's see what colors are available for node 0. At this point, neither 14 nor 22 have been colored yet. So node 0 can be colored 0, but wait, maybe we should see if assigning a color here would cause conflicts later.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at node 22. Node 22 is connected to 0,6,7. Let's process node 7 first. Node 7 is connected to 22,15 (color 2),4. So node 7 can't be color 2 (because of node 15) and can't be the same as 4 or 22. Let's see: node 7's neighbors are 22,15,4. Let's color node 7 first. But node 4 is connected to 12 (color 1), 7, and 19. So node 4 can't be color 1. Let's think about node 4. Since node 4 is connected to 12 (color 1), it must be either 0,2. Let's assign node 4 color 0. Then, node 7, connected to 4 (0) and 15 (2), so node 7 can be color 1. Then, node 22, connected to 0 and 7 (1) and 6. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nBut this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to approach methodically.\n\nFirst, color the triangle nodes 2,12,15.\n\nAssume:\n\n2: 0\n\n12:1\n\n15:2\n\nNow, let's process other nodes connected to these.\n\nLet's look at node 14, connected to 0 and 15 (color 2). So node 14 can't be 2. So possible colors: 0 or 1.\n\nNode 0 is connected to 14 and 22. Let's color node 0 first. Let's pick a color for node 0. Let's say color 0. Then, node 14 can't be 0 (since node 0 is 0 and node 14 is connected to 0) and node 14 is connected to 15 (color 2), so node 14 can be 1. Then, node 14 is 1.\n\nSo:\n\n0:0\n\n14:1\n\nNow, node 0 is 0, connected to 14 (1) and 22. So node 22 can't be 0. Let's process node 22's neighbors: 0 (0),6,7.\n\nSo node 22 can be 1 or 2.\n\nNode 7 is connected to 22, 15 (2),4. Let's color node 7. Since 15 is 2, node 7 can't be 2. Let's say we color node 7 as 1. Then, node 22 can't be 0 (from node 0) or 1 (from node 7). So node 22 must be 2. So:\n\n7:1\n\n22:2\n\nThen, node 6 is connected to 18,16,22 (2). So node 6 can't be 2. So possible colors:0 or1.\n\nLet's pick 0 for node 6. Then, node 16 (connected to 6 (0),20,8) can't be 0.\n\nNode 16's neighbors:6 (0),20,8. So node 16 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nThen node 20 (connected to 12 (1), 16 (1)) can't be 1. So node 20 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nSo:\n\n6:0\n\n16:1\n\n20:0\n\nNow, node 8 is connected to 3 and 16 (1). So node 8 can't be 1. Let's color node 8 as 0. Then, node 3, connected to 8 (0) and 21. So node 3 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nSo:\n\n8:0\n\n3:1\n\nNode 21 is connected to 3 (1), so node 21 can be 0 or 2. Let's choose 0.\n\n21:0\n\nBack to node 4, connected to 12 (1),7 (1),19. So node 4 can't be 1. It can be 0 or 2. Let's choose 0.\n\n4:0\n\nThen node 19 is connected to 12 (1) and 4 (0). So node 19 can't be 0 or 1. Must be 2.\n\n19:2\n\nNode 23 is connected to 12 (1), so node 23 can be 0 or 2. Let's choose 0.\n\n23:0\n\nNode 17 is connected to 2 (0), so can't be 0. Colors 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\n17:1\n\nNode 1 is connected to 2 (0) and 10. So node 1 can't be 0. Let's choose 1. Then node 10, connected to 1 (1), can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\n1:1\n\n10:0\n\nNode 13 is connected to 15 (2). So node 13 can't be 2. Colors 0 or1. Let's choose 0.\n\n13:0\n\nNode 5 is isolated. Let's assign color 0.\n\n5:0\n\nNode 9 is isolated. Assign 0.\n\n9:0\n\nNode 11 is isolated. Assign 0.\n\n11:0\n\nNow, check if any nodes are left:\n\nNode 18 is connected to 6 (0). So can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\n18:1\n\nNode 5,9,11, etc. are done.\n\nNow, let's check all assignments to ensure no adjacent nodes have the same color.\n\nLet's go through each edge:\n\n6-18: 6 is 0, 18 is 1. Okay.\n\n16-20:16 is1, 20 is0. Okay.\n\n4-12:4 is0, 12 is1. Okay.\n\n12-19:12 is1, 19 is2. Okay.\n\n0-14:0 is0, 14 is1. Okay.\n\n2-17:2 is0,17 is1. Okay.\n\n7-22:7 is1,22 is2. Okay.\n\n12-15:12 is1,15 is2. Okay.\n\n14-15:14 is1,15 is2. Okay.\n\n3-21:3 is1,21 is0. Okay.\n\n1-2:1 is1,2 is0. Okay.\n\n0-22:0 is0,22 is2. Okay.\n\n6-16:6 is0,16 is1. Okay.\n\n7-15:7 is1,15 is2. Okay.\n\n4-7:4 is0,7 is1. Okay.\n\n6-22:6 is0,22 is2. Okay.\n\n3-8:3 is1,8 is0. Okay.\n\n12-23:12 is1,23 is0. Okay.\n\n12-20:12 is1,20 is0. Okay.\n\n4-19:4 is0,19 is2. Okay.\n\n8-16:8 is0,16 is1. Okay.\n\n2-12:2 is0,12 is1. Okay.\n\n1-10:1 is1,10 is0. Okay.\n\n2-15:2 is0,15 is2. Okay.\n\n13-15:13 is0,15 is2. Okay.\n\nAll edges seem to be properly colored. Now, check nodes that are isolated:\n\nNodes 5,9,11, etc. They are all colored 0, which is fine since they have no edges.\n\nNow, let's make sure all nodes are assigned a color. The nodes are 0-23.\n\n0:0\n\n1:1\n\n2:0\n\n3:1\n\n4:0\n\n5:0\n\n6:0\n\n7:1\n\n8:0\n\n9:0\n\n10:0\n\n11:0\n\n12:1\n\n13:0\n\n14:1\n\n15:2\n\n16:1\n\n17:1\n\n18:1\n\n19:2\n\n20:0\n\n21:0\n\n22:2\n\n23:0\n\nWait, but wait node 3 is 1, connected to 8 (0) and 21 (0). So that's okay. Node 21 is 0, connected to node3 (1), correct. Node 23 is 0, connected to 12 (1), correct. Node 4 is 0, connected to 12 (1) and 19 (2), correct. Node 19 is 2, connected to 4 (0) and 12 (1), correct. Node 20 is 0, connected to 12 (1) and 16 (1), correct. Node 16 is 1, connected to 6 (0), 20 (0), and 8 (0), correct. Node 8 is 0, connected to 3 (1) and 16 (1), correct. Node 18 is 1, connected to 6 (0), correct. Node 17 is 1, connected to 2 (0), correct. Node 10 is 0, connected to 1 (1), correct. Node 5,9,11 are 0, no edges. Correct.\n\nNow, we have used all three colors: 0,1,2. For example, node15 is 2, node12 is1, node2 is0, etc. So this satisfies the requirement of using exactly 3 colors.\n\nTherefore, this should be a valid coloring.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[3,1],[4,0],[5,0],[6,0],[7,1],[8,0],[9,0],[10,0],[11,0],[12,1],[13,0],[14,1],[15,2],[16,1],[17,1],[18,1],[19,2],[20,0],[21,0],[22,2],[23,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

Let's start by looking at the nodes and edges to figure out a possible coloring. The nodes are from 0 to 38, so 39 nodes in total. The edges are listed, so I need to make sure that connected nodes don't share the same color.\n\nFirst, maybe I should list out all the edges and see which nodes are connected. That might help me identify any cliques or particularly connected nodes. But with so many edges, that might take a while. Alternatively, I can approach this by assigning colors step by step, making sure each node's color is different from its neighbors.\n\nLet me start by looking for nodes that have high degrees. High-degree nodes might be more constrained. Let's check the edges for nodes that appear frequently. For example, node 38 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 35. Hmm, node 5 is connected to 37, 8, 17, 32, 38. Node 8 is connected to 11, 31, 32, 5. Node 17 is connected to 21, 23, 5, 3, 9, etc. So maybe nodes like 5, 8, 17, 38 are high degree.\n\nLet's pick a node and assign a color, then proceed to its neighbors. Let's start with node 0. Assign color 0. Then, its neighbors are 26, 21, 38. So 26, 21, 38 can't be color 0.\n\nNext, node 1 is connected to 34 and 15. Assign color 0. Then 34 and 15 can't be 0.\n\nNode 2 is connected to 36, 38, 12, 24. Assign color 0. So 36, 38, 12, 24 can't be 0.\n\nWait, but maybe this approach might lead to conflicts later. Maybe a better way is to go through each node in order and assign the lowest possible color that's not used by its already assigned neighbors.\n\nSo let's process the nodes from 0 to 38 in order. For each node, check all connected nodes that have already been assigned a color, and choose the smallest color not used by them.\n\nLet's start:\n\nNode 0: connected to 26, 38, 21. None colored yet. Assign color 0.\n\nNode 1: connected to 34, 15. Assign color 0.\n\nNode 2: connected to 36, 38, 12, 24. Assign color 0.\n\nBut wait, node 2's neighbor 38 (node 38) hasn't been colored yet. So the current assignments for node 2's neighbors are none. So assign color 0.\n\nWait, but when node 38 is processed later, we have to ensure that since node 2 is color 0, node 38 can't be 0.\n\nBut since we're processing in order, maybe this will work. Let's proceed.\n\nNode 3: connected to 7, 24, 17. Assign color 0.\n\nWait, node 3's neighbors are 7, 24, 17. None colored yet. Assign 0.\n\nNode 4: connected to 37, 26. Assign 0.\n\nNode 5: connected to 37, 8, 17, 32, 38. Assign 0. But when we process node 5's neighbors later, they can't be 0.\n\nWait, but nodes 37, 8, 17, 32, 38 may have not been colored yet. So this could lead to conflicts. For example, if node 5 is color 0, then nodes 37, 8, etc. must have different colors. But since they come later in the processing order, their colors will be chosen based on previously assigned colors.\n\nHmm, this approach might lead to higher color usage. But since we have to use exactly 3 colors, maybe this can work. Let's proceed and see.\n\nNode 6: connected to 24. Assign 0.\n\nNode 7: connected to 3, 25, 37, 27. Assign 0. But node 3 is color 0. Oh, conflict! Because node 3 is already color 0, and node 7 is connected to node 3. So I can't assign color 0 to node 7. So need to assign the next available color, which is 1.\n\nSo node 7 gets color 1.\n\nNode 8: connected to 11, 32, 31, 5. Node 5 is color 0. So possible colors are 1, 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode 9: connected to 11, 17. Assign 0. (Neighbors not yet colored.)\n\nWait, but node 9's neighbors are 11 and 17. Node 11 and 17 are not yet processed. So assign 0.\n\nNode 10: connected to 15, 27, 28. Assign 0.\n\nNode 11: connected to 9, 8. Node 8 is color 1, node 9 is color 0. So possible colors for 11: 2.\n\nNode 12: connected to 25, 34, 2. Node 2 is color 0. So possible colors: 1, 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode 13: connected to 25, 18. Assign 0.\n\nNode 14: connected to 26. Assign 0.\n\nNode 15: connected to 1, 10. Node 1 is 0, node 10 is 0. So 15 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 16: No edges? Wait, the problem lists nodes from 0 to 38. But in the edges, I don't see node 16 connected to anything. So node 16 is isolated. So it can be colored 0.\n\nBut I need to check the problem statement again. Let me check the edges again. The edges provided are:\n\n4-37, 2-36, 1-34, 3-7, 6-24, 29-32, 12-25, 17-21, 9-11, 12-34, 9-17, 10-15, 5-37, 0-26, 1-15, 10-27, 0-38, 2-38, 35-38, 7-25, 7-37, 8-11, 4-26, 3-24, 17-23, 8-32, 13-25, 7-27, 21-35, 5-8, 3-17, 8-31, 14-26, 5-17, 31-36, 5-32, 0-21, 2-12, 13-18, 5-38, 10-28, 2-24.\n\nLooking for node 16: it's not present in any edge. So node 16 is isolated. So it can be colored 0, 1, or 2. Since we need exactly 3 colors, but the problem allows using all three. But maybe node 16 can be assigned color 0.\n\nContinuing:\n\nNode 16: no edges. Assign 0.\n\nNode 17: connected to 21, 23, 5, 3, 9. Processed nodes so far: 3 (color 0), 5 (color 0), 9 (color 0), 21 (not yet processed), 23 (not processed). So neighbors 3,5,9 are color 0. So node 17 can't be 0. Assign next available color, 1.\n\nNode 18: connected to 13. Node 13 is color 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 19: No edges. So assign 0.\n\nNode 20: No edges? Let me check the edges again. Looking at the edges list, node 20 is not mentioned. So node 20 is isolated. Assign 0.\n\nWait, the nodes are 0-38, so nodes 0 to 38 inclusive. So all nodes are present, but some (like 16,19,20, etc.) have no edges. So they can be colored any color. But since the problem requires exactly 3 colors, but the isolated nodes can be colored with 0.\n\nBut maybe the coloring must use all three colors. Wait, the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\". So the coloring must use all three, but individual nodes can have any of the three. So as long as at least one node uses each color. But perhaps the problem just requires that the coloring uses at most 3 colors, but since the question says \"exactly 3\", maybe we have to use all three. Hmm, but perhaps the problem just requires that the coloring is valid with 3 colors. The exact wording is \"using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2)\". So colors 0,1,2. So the answer must use colors 0,1,2, but each node uses one of them. So as long as no more than three colors are used, but the problem allows using all three. So the answer just needs to be a valid 3-coloring.\n\nSo for the isolated nodes (like 16,19,20), we can assign any color, but perhaps it's better to spread them to ensure all three colors are used. However, maybe the problem doesn't require that all three are used, just that the maximum color used is 2. Wait, the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\". Wait, maybe that's a translation error. Because the colors are numbered 0 to 2, which are three colors. So the question is to use those three colors. So each node must be assigned one of 0,1,2. So it's a 3-coloring. The answer just needs to be a valid 3-coloring. So even if all nodes are color 0, but that's impossible because of the edges. But since there are edges, some nodes must have different colors.\n\nSo back to processing nodes in order.\n\nContinuing from node 17:\n\nNode 17 assigned color 1.\n\nNode 18: connected to 13 (color 0), so assign 1.\n\nNode 19: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNode 20: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNode 21: connected to 17 (color 1), 35, 0 (color 0). So neighbors 0 (color 0), 17 (color 1). So available color is 2. Assign 2.\n\nNode 22: No edges. Assign 0.\n\nWait, looking at the edges, node 22 isn't present. So it's isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNode 23: connected to 17 (color 1). Assign 0.\n\nNode 24: connected to 6, 2, 3. Processed nodes: 2 (color 0), 3 (color 0), 6 (color 0). So node 24 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 25: connected to 12 (color 1), 7 (color 1), 13 (color 0). Neighbors 12 (1),7 (1),13 (0). So node 25 can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\nNode 26: connected to 0 (0),4 (0),14 (0). So node 26 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 27: connected to 10 (color 0),7 (color 1). Assign 2.\n\nNode 28: connected to 10 (color 0). Assign 1.\n\nNode 29: connected to 32. Assign 0.\n\nNode 30: No edges. Assign 0.\n\nNode 31: connected to 8 (color 1), 36. Assign 0. Wait, node 8 is color 1, so node 31 can't be 1. Assign the next available. If processed in order, node 31 hasn't been colored yet. But node 31's connected nodes are 8 and 36. Node 8 is color 1. Assign 0 if possible. Let's see.\n\nWait, node 31 is processed after node 8. When we get to node 31, its neighbor 8 is color 1 and neighbor 36. Node 36 is processed earlier? Wait, node 2 is connected to 36 (node 2 is processed early, color 0). Node 36's connected to 2 (color 0), 31. So node 36's color hasn't been assigned yet when node 31 is being processed. So for node 31's color, we need to check already colored neighbors. Node 8 is color 1. So node 31 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Let's assign 0. Then node 36, when processed, must not be the same as node 2 (0) and node 31 (0). So node 36 would need to be 1 or 2.\n\nContinuing:\n\nNode 31: assign 0.\n\nNode 32: connected to 29 (0),8 (1),5 (0). So neighbors 29 (0),8 (1),5 (0). So node 32 can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\nNode 33: No edges. Assign 0.\n\nNode 34: connected to 1 (0), 12 (1). Assign 2.\n\nNode 35: connected to 38 (not yet processed), 21 (2). Assign color 0. Wait, node 35 is connected to 21 (color 2) and 38. So node 35 can't be 2. Assign the lowest possible, which is 0. But when node 38 is processed later, it's connected to 35 (0) and others.\n\nNode 35: assigned 0.\n\nNode 36: connected to 2 (0),31 (0). So can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 37: connected to 4 (0),7 (1),5 (0). Assign 2. Because neighbors 4 (0),7 (1),5 (0). So available is 2.\n\nNode 38: connected to 0 (0),2 (0),5 (0),35 (0). So all connected nodes are color 0. So node 38 can't be 0. Assign 1. Wait, but node 38's edges are 0-38, 2-38, 5-38, 35-38. So neighbors 0,2,5,35. All of which are color 0. So node 38 must be 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nNow, checking the remaining nodes:\n\nNode 28: connected to 10 (color 0). Assign 1.\n\nNode 29: connected to 32 (color 2). Assign 0.\n\nNode 30: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNode 31: assigned 0 earlier.\n\nNode 32: assigned 2.\n\nNode 33: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNode 34: assigned 2.\n\nNode 35: assigned 0.\n\nNode 36: assigned 1.\n\nNode 37: assigned 2.\n\nNode 38: assigned 1.\n\nNow, let's check for any conflicts.\n\nCheck node 0: color 0. Neighbors 26 (color 1), 21 (color 2), 38 (color 1). No conflict.\n\nNode 1: color 0. Neighbors 34 (2), 15 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 2: color 0. Neighbors 36 (1),38 (1),12 (1),24 (1). All different. Wait, 36 is 1, so node 2's color 0 is okay.\n\nWait, node 2's neighbors are 36, 38, 12, 24. All of those are color 1 (node 36: 1, node 38:1, node12:1, node24:1). So node 2's color 0 is okay.\n\nNode 3: color 0. Neighbors 7 (1),24 (1),17 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 4: color 0. Neighbors 37 (2),26 (1). Okay.\n\nNode5: color 0. Neighbors 37 (2),8 (1),17 (1),32 (2),38 (1). All different.\n\nNode6: color 0. Neighbor 24 (1). Okay.\n\nNode7: color 1. Neighbors 3 (0),25 (2),37 (2),27 (2). All okay.\n\nNode8: color 1. Neighbors 11 (2),32 (2),31 (0),5 (0). All okay.\n\nNode9: color 0. Neighbors 11 (2),17 (1). Okay.\n\nNode10: color 0. Neighbors 15 (1),27 (2),28 (1). Okay.\n\nNode11: color 2. Neighbors 9 (0),8 (1).

Let's start by understanding the structure of the graph. There are 46 nodes (from 0 to 45) and a bunch of edges. My goal is to assign each node a color (0, 1, or 2) such that no two connected nodes share the same color. \n\nFirst, I should probably list out all the edges to see the connections. Let me parse through the edges provided. For example, node 0 is connected to 36 and 37. Node 2 is connected to 33, 23, and 24. Hmm, this might get complicated. Maybe I can approach this by building an adjacency list. That way, I can track which nodes are connected to each other.\n\nBuilding the adjacency list step by step. For each edge, I'll add both directions since it's an undirected graph. So for the first edge 0-36, I add 36 to 0's list and 0 to 36's list. Doing this for all edges. Let's see:\n\n- 0: 36,37\n- 2: 33,23,24\n- 16:29\n- 24:36,26,2\n- 35:42\n- 12:19,10\n- 20:32,31,15\n- 4:15,30,34\n- 23:34,2,8,38\n- 8:15,26,23\n- 22:38,27\n- 27:28,30,22\n- 4:15,30,34 (wait, already covered)\nWait, maybe I should list all edges properly. Let's take each edge one by one:\n\nEdges list:\n0 - 36\n2 - 33\n16 - 29\n24 - 36\n35 - 42\n12 - 19\n20 - 32\n4 - 15\n23 - 34\n8 - 15\n22 - 38\n27 - 28\n4 - 30\n10 - 12\n9 - 17\n2 - 23\n28 - 39\n24 - 26\n19 - 42\n13 - 29\n15 - 20\n15 - 26\n15 - 29\n5 - 9\n20 - 31\n18 - 43\n8 - 23\n27 - 30\n10 - 14\n8 - 26\n37 - 41\n7 - 9\n26 - 28\n0 - 37\n11 - 43\n10 - 41\n6 - 28\n38 - 42\n22 - 27\n15 - 43\n23 - 38\n4 - 34\n17 - 31\n19 - 31\n2 - 24\n\nWait, some nodes might have multiple edges. For example, node 15 is connected to 4, 8, 20, 26, 29, 43. That's a lot. So node 15's neighbors are 4,8,20,26,29,43. So when coloring 15, all these nodes must have different colors from 15.\n\nThis seems challenging. Maybe a backtracking approach would work, but since the graph is large, maybe a greedy algorithm with ordering by degree could help. Let's try to order the nodes in descending order of their degrees and assign colors in that order. That way, higher-degree nodes get colored first, reducing conflicts.\n\nFirst, let's compute the degree of each node. The degree is the number of edges connected to the node. Let's go through each edge and count how many times each node appears.\n\nLet me list all edges again and count:\n\nEdges (both directions):\n\n0: connected to 36,37 (2 edges)\n2: connected to 33,23,24,24 (wait, 2-24 is in the list twice? Let's check. The edges listed are 2-33, 2-23, 2-24. So three edges for node 2. So node 2's edges: 33,23,24.\n\nSimilarly, 24 is connected to 36,26,2, and in the last edge 2-24 again. Wait, the edges are:\n\nOriginal edges list (each line is an edge):\n\n0 - 36\n2 - 33\n16 - 29\n24 - 36\n35 - 42\n12 - 19\n20 - 32\n4 - 15\n23 - 34\n8 - 15\n22 - 38\n27 - 28\n4 - 30\n10 - 12\n9 - 17\n2 - 23\n28 - 39\n24 - 26\n19 - 42\n13 - 29\n15 - 20\n15 - 26\n15 - 29\n5 - 9\n20 - 31\n18 - 43\n8 - 23\n27 - 30\n10 - 14\n8 - 26\n37 - 41\n7 - 9\n26 - 28\n0 - 37\n11 - 43\n10 - 41\n6 - 28\n38 - 42\n22 - 27\n15 - 43\n23 - 38\n4 - 34\n17 - 31\n19 - 31\n2 - 24\n\nWait, the last edge is 2-24, which was already mentioned earlier as 24-2, so that's the same edge. So node 2 has edges to 33,23,24 (three edges). Node 24 has edges to 36,26,2 (three edges? Wait, original edges: 24-36, 24-26, and 2-24. So three edges for node 24.\n\nLet's start counting each node's degree:\n\nStart with all nodes from 0 to 45. Initialize degrees to 0.\n\nFor each edge, increment both nodes' degrees by 1.\n\nProcessing each edge:\n\n0-36 → degrees 0,36 → +1 each.\n2-33 → 2,33 → +1.\n16-29 → 16,29 → +1.\n24-36 → 24,36 → +1.\n35-42 → 35,42 → +1.\n12-19 → 12,19 → +1.\n20-32 → 20,32 → +1.\n4-15 → 4,15 → +1.\n23-34 →23,34 → +1.\n8-15 →8,15 → +1.\n22-38 →22,38 →+1.\n27-28 →27,28 →+1.\n4-30 →4,30 →+1.\n10-12 →10,12 →+1.\n9-17 →9,17 →+1.\n2-23 →2,23 →+1.\n28-39 →28,39 →+1.\n24-26 →24,26 →+1.\n19-42 →19,42 →+1.\n13-29 →13,29 →+1.\n15-20 →15,20 →+1.\n15-26 →15,26 →+1.\n15-29 →15,29 →+1.\n5-9 →5,9 →+1.\n20-31 →20,31 →+1.\n18-43 →18,43 →+1.\n8-23 →8,23 →+1.\n27-30 →27,30 →+1.\n10-14 →10,14 →+1.\n8-26 →8,26 →+1.\n37-41 →37,41 →+1.\n7-9 →7,9 →+1.\n26-28 →26,28 →+1.\n0-37 →0,37 →+1.\n11-43 →11,43 →+1.\n10-41 →10,41 →+1.\n6-28 →6,28 →+1.\n38-42 →38,42 →+1.\n22-27 →22,27 →+1.\n15-43 →15,43 →+1.\n23-38 →23,38 →+1.\n4-34 →4,34 →+1.\n17-31 →17,31 →+1.\n19-31 →19,31 →+1.\n2-24 →2,24 →+1.\n\nNow let's tally the degrees for each node. Let me list each node and their degree:\n\n0: edges with 36,37,37 → wait, 0 has edges 0-36, 0-37 (from edges 0-36 and 0-37). So degree 2.\n\n1: not mentioned, so 0.\n\n2: edges with 33,23,24,24? Wait, edges for 2 are 2-33, 2-23, 2-24, and the last edge 2-24 again? No, the last edge is 2-24 once. So total edges for 2: 2-33, 2-23, 2-24 → three edges. So degree 3.\n\n3: no edges, degree 0.\n\n4: edges with 15,30,34,34 (from edges 4-15, 4-30, 4-34). So three edges. So degree 3.\n\n5: edge with 9 → degree 1.\n\n6: edge with 28 → degree 1.\n\n7: edge with 9 → degree 1.\n\n8: edges with 15,23,26. Edges: 8-15,8-23,8-26. Three edges. Degree 3.\n\n9: edges with 17,5,7. Edges 9-17,5-9,7-9. So three edges. Degree 3.\n\n10: edges with 12,14,41. Edges 10-12,10-14,10-41. Three edges. Degree 3.\n\n11: edge with 43 → degree 1.\n\n12: edges with 19,10,10. Wait, edges 12-19,10-12 → so two edges. Degree 2.\n\nWait, let me check each node:\n\n0: edges 0-36, 0-37 → degree 2.\n\n1: 0.\n\n2: edges 2-33, 2-23, 2-24 → three edges. Degree 3.\n\n3: 0.\n\n4: edges 4-15, 4-30, 4-34 → three edges. Degree 3.\n\n5: 5-9 → 1.\n\n6: 6-28 →1.\n\n7:7-9 →1.\n\n8:8-15,8-23,8-26 → three edges. Degree 3.\n\n9:9-17,5-9,7-9 → three edges. Degree 3.\n\n10:10-12,10-14,10-41 → three edges. Degree 3.\n\n11:11-43 →1.\n\n12:12-19,10-12 → two edges. Degree 2.\n\n13:13-29 →1.\n\n14:10-14 →1.\n\n15: edges 4-15, 8-15,15-20,15-26,15-29,15-43 → so six edges. Degree 6.\n\n16:16-29 →1.\n\n17:9-17,17-31 → two edges. Degree 2.\n\n18:18-43 →1.\n\n19:12-19,19-42,19-31 → three edges. Degree 3.\n\n20:20-32,15-20,20-31 → three edges. Degree 3.\n\n21: no edges →0.\n\n22:22-38,22-27 → two edges. Degree 2.\n\n23:23-34,2-23,8-23,23-38 → four edges. Degree 4.\n\n24:24-36,24-26,2-24 → three edges. Degree 3.\n\n25: no edges →0.\n\n26:24-26,15-26,8-26,26-28 → four edges. Degree 4.\n\n27:27-28,27-30,22-27 → three edges. Degree 3.\n\n28:27-28,28-39,26-28,6-28 → four edges. Degree 4.\n\n29:16-29,13-29,15-29 → three edges. Degree 3.\n\n30:4-30,27-30 → two edges. Degree 2.\n\n31:20-31,17-31,19-31 → three edges. Degree 3.\n\n32:20-32 →1.\n\n33:2-33 →1.\n\n34:23-34,4-34 → two edges. Degree 2.\n\n35:35-42 →1.\n\n36:0-36,24-36 → two edges. Degree 2.\n\n37:0-37,37-41 → two edges. Degree 2.\n\n38:22-38,38-42,23-38 → three edges. Degree 3.\n\n39:28-39 →1.\n\n40: no edges →0.\n\n41:37-41,10-41 → two edges. Degree 2.\n\n42:35-42,19-42,38-42 → three edges. Degree 3.\n\n43:18-43,11-43,15-43 → three edges. Degree 3.\n\n44: no edges →0.\n\n45: no edges →0.\n\nSo the highest degree nodes are 15 (degree 6), then 23 (4), 26 (4), 28 (4), then others with 3, etc. So to proceed with the greedy approach, we should order nodes starting from the highest degree. So the order would be 15, then 23,26,28, then others with degree 3, etc.\n\nThe plan is:\n\n1. Order nodes by descending degree: 15,23,26,28, then 2,4,8,9,10,19,20,27,29,38,42,43, then others.\n\n2. For each node in this order, assign the smallest possible color (0,1,2) that is not used by any of its already-colored neighbors.\n\nBut since I need to do this manually, perhaps I can start with node 15 first, assign color 0. Then check its neighbors (4,8,20,26,29,43). Those nodes cannot be color 0. Then proceed to next highest node.\n\nBut since this is a manual process, maybe I can proceed step by step.\n\nLet's start:\n\nOrdering the nodes as follows (descending degree):\n\n15 (6), 23 (4), 26 (4), 28 (4), 38 (3), 42 (3), 43 (3), 2 (3), 4 (3), 8 (3), 9 (3), 10 (3), 19 (3), 20 (3), 27 (3), 29 (3), 22 (2), 34 (2), 36 (2), 37 (2), 41 (2), 0 (2), 12 (2), 17 (2), 30 (2), 5 (1), 6 (1),7 (1), 11 (1),13 (1),14 (1),16 (1),18 (1),24 (3), 31 (3), 32 (1),33 (1),35 (1),39 (1),40 (0), 1 (0),3 (0),21 (0),25 (0),40 (0),44 (0),45 (0).\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in ordering. Let's list degrees again for key nodes:\n\nNodes with degree 4: 23,26,28.\n\nThen degree 3: 2,4,8,9,10,19,20,27,29,38,42,43,24,31.\n\nWait, 24 has degree 3 (edges 24-36,24-26,2-24). Yes. So 24 has degree 3.\n\nSo the order would be:\n\n15 (6) → 23 (4) →26 (4) →28 (4) → then all degree 3 nodes: 2,4,8,9,10,19,20,27,29,38,42,43,24,31. Then others.\n\nProceeding step by step.\n\nLet me create a table where I assign colors to each node in order.\n\nStart with node 15. Assign color 0.\n\nSo color_map[15] = 0.\n\nNext, node 23 (degree 4). Its neighbors: 34,2,8,38. Wait, but none of these have been colored yet. So assign the smallest color possible. Assign 0. Wait, but color 0 is allowed if none of the neighbors have it. Wait, but node 8 is a neighbor. Node 8 hasn't been colored yet. So since we are processing in order, maybe 23's neighbors (like 8) haven't been colored yet. So when assigning color to 23, we need to check already colored neighbors. Since we process 23 after 15, but 8 is a neighbor of 23, but 8 hasn't been processed yet. So in the greedy approach, only the already-colored neighbors are checked. So if none of 23's neighbors have been colored yet, assign color 0. But that could lead to conflicts when we later color its neighbors. However, in the greedy algorithm, since we process higher-degree nodes first, the lower-degree neighbors (which might have higher degrees, but in this case, node 8 is processed later but has a degree 3. Wait, maybe node 8 is processed after 23. Let's see.\n\nWait, node 8 has degree 3 and is in the list after 23. So when processing node 23, node 8 hasn't been colored yet. So when assigning color to node 23, the only already-colored neighbors are none. So can assign color 0. Let's do that: color_map[23] = 0.\n\nWait, but node 23 is connected to 8, which hasn't been processed yet. So when we get to node 8, we have to make sure it's a different color than 23. But since we're assigning colors in order, this is possible. Let's proceed.\n\nNext node: 26 (degree 4). Neighbors are 24,15,8,28. Among these, 15 is already colored (0). So neighbors with color 0: 15. So cannot assign 0. Assign the next color, 1. So color_map[26] = 1.\n\nNext node: 28 (degree 4). Neighbors are 27,39,26,6. So node 26 is already colored with 1. So cannot assign 1. Assign 0. color_map[28] = 0.\n\nNext, node 38 (degree 3). Neighbors:22,42,23. 23 is colored 0. So can't use 0. Assign 1. color_map[38] = 1.\n\nNext node 42 (degree 3). Neighbors:35,19,38. 38 is colored 1. So cannot use 1. Assign 0. color_map[42] =0.\n\nNext node 43 (degree 3). Neighbors:18,11,15. 15 is colored 0. So assign 1. color_map[43] =1.\n\nNext node 2 (degree 3). Neighbors:33,23,24. 23 is colored 0. So can't use 0. Assign 1. color_map[2]=1.\n\nNext node 4 (degree 3). Neighbors:15,30,34. 15 is colored 0. So can't use 0. Assign 1. color_map[4]=1.\n\nNext node 8 (degree 3). Neighbors:15,23,26. 15 is 0, 23 is 0, 26 is 1. So neighbors colors: 0,0,1. So can't use 0 or 1. Assign 2. color_map[8]=2.\n\nWait, this is the first time we need to use color 2. Let's check.\n\nSo node 8's neighbors are 15 (0), 23 (0), 26 (1). So available colors are 2. Assign 2.\n\nNext node 9 (degree 3). Neighbors:17,5,7. None of these have been colored yet. Assign 0. color_map[9]=0.\n\nNext node 10 (degree 3). Neighbors:12,14,41. None colored yet. Assign 0. color_map[10]=0.\n\nNext node 19 (degree 3). Neighbors:12,42,31. 42 is colored 0. So can't use 0. Assign 1. color_map[19]=1.\n\nNext node 20 (degree 3). Neighbors:32,15,31. 15 is 0. So assign 1. color_map[20]=1.\n\nNext node 27 (degree 3). Neighbors:28,30,22. 28 is 0. So can't use 0. Assign 1. color_map[27]=1.\n\nNext node 29 (degree 3). Neighbors:16,13,15. 15 is 0. Assign 1. color_map[29]=1.\n\nNext node 24 (degree 3). Neighbors:36,26,2. 26 is 1, 2 is 1. So can't use 1. Assign 0. color_map[24]=0.\n\nNext node 31 (degree 3). Neighbors:20,17,19. 20 is 1, 19 is 1. Assign 0. color_map[31]=0.\n\nNow, moving on to nodes with degree 2:\n\nNext, node 22 (degree 2). Neighbors:38,27. 38 is 1, 27 is 1. Assign 0. color_map[22]=0.\n\nNode 34 (degree 2). Neighbors:23,4. 23 is 0,4 is 1. Assign 2. color_map[34]=2.\n\nNode 36 (degree 2). Neighbors:0,24. 0 is not colored yet. 24 is 0. Assign 1. color_map[36]=1.\n\nNode 37 (degree 2). Neighbors:0,41. 0 is not colored. Assign 0. color_map[37]=0.\n\nNode 41 (degree 2). Neighbors:37,10. 37 is 0, 10 is 0. Assign 1. color_map[41]=1.\n\nNode 0 (degree 2). Neighbors:36,37. 36 is 1,37 is 0. Available colors: 2. Assign 2. color_map[0]=2.\n\nNode 12 (degree 2). Neighbors:19,10. 19 is 1,10 is 0. Assign 2. color_map[12]=2.\n\nNode 17 (degree 2). Neighbors:9,31. 9 is 0,31 is 0. Assign 1. color_map[17]=1.\n\nNode 30 (degree 2). Neighbors:4,27. 4 is 1,27 is 1. Assign 0. color_map[30]=0.\n\nNow, nodes with degree 1:\n\nNode5: neighbor 9 (0). Assign 1. color_map[5]=1.\n\nNode6: neighbor 28 (0). Assign 1. color_map[6]=1.\n\nNode7: neighbor 9 (0). Assign 1. color_map[7]=1.\n\nNode11: neighbor 43 (1). Assign 0. color_map[11]=0.\n\nNode13: neighbor 29 (1). Assign 0. color_map[13]=0.\n\nNode14: neighbor 10 (0). Assign 1. color_map[14]=1.\n\nNode16: neighbor 29 (1). Assign 0. color_map[16]=0.\n\nNode18: neighbor 43 (1). Assign 0. color_map[18]=0.\n\nNode32: neighbor 20 (1). Assign 0. color_map[32]=0.\n\nNode33: neighbor 2 (1). Assign 0. color_map[33]=0.\n\nNode35: neighbor 42 (0). Assign 1. color_map[35]=1.\n\nNode39: neighbor 28 (0). Assign 1. color_map[39]=1.\n\nNodes with degree 0 (21,25, etc.) can be colored arbitrarily. Let's assign them all 0.\n\nNow, let's check for conflicts.\n\nCheck node 15 (0): neighbors 4 (1),8 (2),20 (1),26 (1),29 (1),43 (1). All different. Good.\n\nNode23 (0): neighbors 34 (2),2 (1),8 (2),38 (1). Wait, node23's neighbors: 34 (color 2), 2 (color1), 8 (color2), 38 (color1). So node23 is 0. No conflicts.\n\nNode26 (1): neighbors 24 (0),15 (0),8 (2),28 (0). Wait, node26 is 1. Neighbors 24 is 0, 15 is 0, 8 is 2, 28 is 0. All different.\n\nNode28 (0): neighbors 27 (1),39 (1),26 (1),6 (1). Wait, node28 is 0. Neighbors 27 is 1, 39 is1, 26 is1, 6 is1. So no conflicts.\n\nNode38 (1): neighbors 22 (0),42 (0),23 (0). 22 is 0,42 is0,23 is0. 38 is 1. No conflicts.\n\nNode42 (0): neighbors35 (1),19 (1),38 (1). All are 1, so 42 is 0. Good.\n\nNode43 (1): neighbors18 (0),11 (0),15 (0). All 0. 43 is 1.

I need to color this graph with exactly 3 colors. The nodes are from 0 to 37, which is 38 nodes in total. The edges are provided, so I need to make sure that no two connected nodes share the same color. Let's start by understanding the structure of the graph.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges to see if there are any patterns or clusters. For example, let's check which nodes are connected. Node 0 is connected to 1, 6, 21, 31, 33. So those can't have the same color as 0. Node 1 is connected to 0, 15, 18. Node 2 is connected to 12 and 25. Hmm. Maybe I should look for nodes that have a lot of connections first, as they might be more constrained.\n\nLooking at the edges, let's see some high-degree nodes. For example, node 4 is connected to 3, 24, 26, 36. Node 5 is connected to 19, 34, 29, 35. Node 6 is connected to 18, 25, 28, 0. Node 12 is connected to 37, 33, 36, 35, 2. Node 28 is connected to 6, 32, 37, 10. Node 29 is connected to 20, 35, 3, 5. Node 35 is connected to 29, 12, 5. So maybe these nodes have higher degrees and need to be colored carefully.\n\nAnother approach is to try to use a greedy coloring algorithm. Assign colors in order, choosing the smallest available color that hasn't been used by adjacent nodes. But since the problem requires exactly 3 colors, maybe the graph is 3-colorable. Let's confirm that it's not a bipartite graph (which would be 2-colorable), but with some edges that form odd-length cycles, making it require 3 colors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the graph contains cycles of odd length, which would necessitate 3 colors. But I don't need to check that now; the user says to use exactly 3, so it's possible.\n\nLet me start by assigning colors step by step. Let's pick a node and assign a color, then proceed to its neighbors, ensuring no conflicts.\n\nLet's start with node 0. Assign color 0. Then its neighbors (1,6,21,31,33) can't be 0.\n\nNext, node 1 is connected to 0. Assign color 1. Then its neighbors (0,15,18) must not be 1. So node 15 and 18 can't be 1.\n\nNode 2 is connected to 12 and 25. Let's assign color 0 to node 2. Then 12 and 25 can't be 0.\n\nNode 3 is connected to 4, 29, 30. Assign color 0. Then 4, 29,30 can't be 0.\n\nNode 4 is connected to 3,24,26,36. So since 3 is color 0, node 4 can be 1. Then 24,26,36 can't be 1.\n\nNode 5 is connected to 19,34,29,35. Assign color 0. So 19,34,29,35 can't be 0.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 18,25,28,0. Node 0 is color 0, so node 6 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Then neighbors (18,25,28) can't be 1.\n\nWait, but node 25 is connected to node 2 (color 0) and node 6 (color 1). So node 25's color must be different from both. So possible color is 2.\n\nWait, I should proceed methodically. Maybe using a list to track each node's color and their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, let's use a graph structure where each node's adjacency list is known. Then, iterate through the nodes in some order and assign the smallest possible color not used by their neighbors.\n\nBut the problem is that the order in which we process nodes can affect the color assignment. Let's choose an order, perhaps starting with higher-degree nodes first to minimize backtracking.\n\nLet me list the degrees of each node to determine processing order. But since the edges are given, maybe it's easier to count how many times each node appears in the edge list.\n\nNode 0: connected to 1,6,21,31,33 (degree 5)\nNode 1: connected to 0,15,18 (3)\nNode 2: connected to 12,25 (2)\nNode 3: connected to 4,29,30 (3)\nNode 4: connected to 3,24,26,36 (4)\nNode 5: connected to 19,34,29,35 (4)\nNode 6: connected to 18,25,28,0 (4)\nNode 7: connected to 26 (1)\nNode 8: connected to 15 (1)\nNode 9: connected to 19 (1)\nNode 10: connected to 28 (1)\nNode 11: connected to 32,31,30 (3)\nNode 12: connected to 37,33,36,35,2 (5)\nNode 13: not mentioned in edges (degree 0)\nNode 14: connected to 18,32 (2)\nNode 15: connected to 8,1 (2)\nNode 16: connected to 20 (1)\nNode 17: connected to 21,26 (2)\nNode 18: connected to 6,1,14 (3)\nNode 19: connected to 5,9 (2)\nNode 20: connected to 16,29 (2)\nNode 21: connected to 0,17 (2)\nNode 22: not mentioned (degree 0)\nNode 23: not mentioned (degree 0)\nNode 24: connected to 4,25 (2)\nNode 25: connected to 2,6,24 (3)\nNode 26: connected to 7,4,17 (3)\nNode 27: not mentioned (degree 0)\nNode 28: connected to 6,32,37,10 (4)\nNode 29: connected to 20,3,5,35 (4)\nNode 30: connected to 3,11 (2)\nNode 31: connected to 0,11 (2)\nNode 32: connected to 11,28,14 (3)\nNode 33: connected to 0,12 (2)\nNode 34: connected to 5 (1)\nNode 35: connected to 29,12,5 (3)\nNode 36: connected to 4,12 (2)\nNode 37: connected to 12,28 (2)\n\nSo nodes with higher degrees are 0,12 (5), 4,5,6,28 (4), and some others. Let's process nodes in order of descending degree. But maybe even better, let's process in the order 0,12,4,5,6,28, etc.\n\nStarting with node 0: assign color 0. Neighbors (1,6,21,31,33) can't be 0.\n\nNext node 12: connected to 37,33,36,35,2. Let's check possible colors. The neighbors are 37,33,36,35,2. Among these, node 33 is connected to 0 (color 0). So node 33's color is not 0. Node 2 is not yet colored. So for node 12, possible colors. The colors used by its neighbors. Wait, the neighbors of 12 are 37,33,36,35,2. But these nodes may not have been colored yet. So in a greedy approach, we assign the smallest available color not used by already colored neighbors. Since we are processing in order of high degree, let's see:\n\nWait, perhaps processing in the order of nodes 0,12,4,5,6, etc.\n\nNode 0: color 0.\n\nNode 12: neighbors are 37,33,36,35,2. Let's check which of these have been colored. None yet except 33, which hasn't been processed. Wait, node 33 is connected to 0 (color 0). So node 33 cannot be color 0. But node 12's color is being decided. So possible colors for 12: the colors not used by its already processed neighbors. But in this order, node 12's neighbors (37,33,36,35,2) haven't been processed yet. So the only constraint for node 12's color is any color except those taken by its neighbors that have been processed. But since none have been processed yet, the first color is 0. But we can't use 0 if any neighbor is already 0. Wait, but in the current processing order, the neighbors haven't been colored yet. So the greedy approach here would assign the smallest possible color, which is 0. But we need to check if any neighbor is already 0. If node 33 is connected to node 0 (color 0), but node 33 hasn't been colored yet. So node 12 can take color 0. Then, when node 33 is processed, it can't be 0. But maybe this is possible. Wait, node 12 is connected to node 33, which is connected to node 0 (color 0). So node 33 will have to choose a color different from 0 and 12's color (0). So node 33 would have to choose color 1 or 2. Let's proceed.\n\nSo node 12 is color 0. Then, its neighbors (37,33,36,35,2) cannot be 0.\n\nNext node 4: connected to 3,24,26,36. Let's check if any of these are colored. Node 3 hasn't been colored yet. So assign the smallest available color. Let's choose color 0. But need to check if neighbors are already 0. No, since they haven't been processed. Wait, but node 3 is connected to 4. So if node 4 is colored 0, then node 3 can't be 0. But node 3 hasn't been colored yet. So maybe assign color 0 to node 4. Then, node 3's possible colors would be 1 or 2.\n\nProceeding, node 5: connected to 19,34,29,35. Assign color 0. Then neighbors can't be 0.\n\nNode 6: connected to 18,25,28,0 (which is color 0). So node 6 can't be 0. Assign color 1.\n\nNode 28: connected to 6 (color 1), 32,37,10. So color 0 is possible if none of its neighbors are 0. But node 6 is color 1. Assign color 0 to node 28. Then 32,37,10 can't be 0.\n\nThis approach might work, but perhaps there's a conflict later. Let's proceed.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better way is to use backtracking or a systematic approach. However, since it's a large graph (38 nodes), doing this manually is error-prone. Let's see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the graph is 3-colorable, and we can assign colors in a way that cycles are handled. For example, use a three-coloring strategy where each node's color is determined by its position mod 3. But that's not guaranteed to work unless the graph has a specific structure.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to split the graph into layers. For example, assign color 0 to nodes in even layers, color 1 to odd layers, etc. But again, without knowing the graph structure, this is risky.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the fact that some nodes are isolated. For example, nodes 13,22,23,27 are not connected to any other nodes. So their color can be any of the three. Assign them color 0 to minimize color usage, but since the problem requires exactly 3 colors, perhaps we need to use all three. Wait, but the problem says 'exactly 3 colors', but the graph could be colored with fewer. However, the user says to use exactly 3. So even if the graph could be colored with 2, but the user wants 3, perhaps some nodes must be assigned different colors. But I think the problem is that the graph requires 3 colors, and the answer must use exactly 3. So perhaps the graph is 3-chromatic. So I need to ensure that all adjacent nodes have different colors and exactly 3 colors are used.\n\nBut for the purpose of this task, perhaps assigning colors in a way that alternates between 0,1,2 where possible.\n\nLet's try to proceed step by step, assigning colors to nodes in order from 0 to 37, checking their neighbors.\n\nStart with node 0. Assign color 0. Then node 1 is a neighbor. Assign color 1. Node 2: check its neighbors (12,25). Neither is colored yet. Assign color 0. Node 3: neighbors (4,29,30). Assign color 0. Node 4: connected to 3 (color 0). Assign color 1. Node 5: neighbors (19,34,29,35). Assign color 0. Node 6: connected to 0 (color 0). Assign color 1. Node 7: connected to 26. Assign color 0. Node 8: connected to 15. Assign color 0. Node 9: connected to 19. Assign color 0. Node 10: connected to 28. Assign color 0. Node 11: connected to 32,31,30. Assign color 0. Node 12: connected to 37,33,36,35,2. Node 2 is color 0. Assign color 1. Node 13: no neighbors. Assign color 0. Node 14: connected to 18,32. Assign color 0. Node 15: connected to 1 (color 1) and 8 (color 0). Assign color 2. Node 16: connected to 20. Assign color 0. Node 17: connected to 21,26. Assign color 0. Node 18: connected to 1 (color 1), 6 (color 1), and 14 (color 0). Assign color 2. Node 19: connected to 5 (color 0), 9 (color 0). Assign color 1. Node 20: connected to 16 (color 0) and 29. Assign color 1. Node 21: connected to 0 (color 0) and 17 (color 0). Assign color 1. Node 22: no neighbors. Assign color 0. Node 23: no neighbors. Assign color 0. Node 24: connected to 4 (color 1) and 25. Assign color 0. Node 25: connected to 2 (color 0), 6 (color 1), 24 (color 0). So neighbors are 2 (0), 6 (1), 24 (0). So available color is 2. Assign 2. Node 26: connected to 7 (color 0),4 (color 1),17 (color 0). Assign color 2. Node 27: no neighbors. Assign 0. Node 28: connected to 6 (color 1), 32,37,10 (color 0). Assign color 2. Node 29: connected to 3 (color 0),20 (color 1),5 (color 0),35. Assign color 2. Node 30: connected to 3 (color 0),11 (color 0). Assign color 1. Node 31: connected to 0 (color 0),11 (color 0). Assign color 1. Node 32: connected to 11 (color 0),28 (color 2),14 (color 0). Assign color 1. Node 33: connected to 0 (color 0),12 (color 1). Assign color 2. Node 34: connected to 5 (color 0). Assign color 1. Node 35: connected to 29 (color 2),12 (color 1),5 (color 0). Assign color 0. Node 36: connected to 4 (color 1),12 (color 1). Assign color 0. Node 37: connected to 12 (color 1),28 (color 2). Assign color 0.\n\nNow, let's check for conflicts. For example:\n\n- Node 0 (0) connected to 1 (1), 6 (1), 21 (1), 31 (1), 33 (2). No conflicts.\n- Node 1 (1) connected to 0 (0), 15 (2), 18 (2). Okay.\n- Node 2 (0) connected to 12 (1), 25 (2). Okay.\n- Node 3 (0) connected to 4 (1), 29 (2), 30 (1). Okay.\n- Node 4 (1) connected to 3 (0), 24 (0), 26 (2), 36 (0). All different.\n- Node 5 (0) connected to 19 (1), 34 (1), 29 (2), 35 (0). Wait, 35 is color 0. But node 5 is connected to 35. Oh, conflict here! Node 5 is color 0, and node 35 is color 0. That's a problem. So need to adjust.\n\nSo node 35 is connected to 5 (0), so it can't be 0. Let's see: node 35 is connected to 29 (2),12 (1),5 (0). So possible colors are 0,1,2. But 12 is 1, 5 is 0. So available color is 2. Assign color 2 to node 35. Then check node 35's other connections. Node 12 is color 1. So 35 can be 2. Now, node 35's color is 2. Let's update that.\n\nNow, node 35 is 2. Then node 35's neighbors: 29 (2), which would create a conflict. Oh wait, node 29 is color 2. So node 29 and 35 are connected and both color 2. That's a problem. So need to resolve this.\n\nNode 29 is connected to 3 (0),20 (1),5 (0),35 (2). So node 29's color is 2. Its neighbors: 3 (0), 20 (1), 5 (0), 35 (2). So node 20 is color 1, so 29 can be 2. Then node 35 is connected to 29 (2), which is a conflict. So both 29 and 35 are color 2. That's invalid.\n\nSo we need to adjust. Let's backtrack. When we assigned color 2 to node 35, but node 29 is already 2, which is connected to 35. So that's a problem. So node 35 must be a color different from 29's color. Let's see:\n\nNode 29 is connected to 3 (0),20 (1),5 (0),35. So node 29's possible colors are 1 or 2 (since 3 is 0, 20 is 1, 5 is 0). Assign color 2 to node 29. Then node 35, connected to 29 (2), 12 (1), 5 (0). So node 35 can't be 2. So possible colors are 0 and 1. But node 5 is 0. So node 35 can't be 0. So assign color 1. But node 12 is color 1. So node 35 can't be 1. So this is a problem. Thus, node 35's possible colors are 2 (if possible). Wait, no. If node 29 is 2, then node 35 can't be 2. Node 12 is 1, so node 35 can't be 1. Node 5 is 0, so node 35 can't be 0. That's a conflict. So this suggests that the initial assignments are leading to a contradiction. Hence, we need to adjust earlier steps.\n\nPerhaps the problem arises from the color assignment of node 29. Let's reevaluate.\n\nNode 29 is connected to 20,3,5,35. Let's assign color 1 to node 29. Then its neighbors can't be 1. So node 20's color is 1 (from earlier step), which would conflict. So node 20 must have a different color. Let's check node 20: connected to 16 (color 0) and 29. Assign color 2 to node 20. Then node 29 can be 1. Then node 29's color is 1. Now, node 35, connected to 29 (1), 12 (1), 5 (0). So node 35 can't be 1. So available colors are 0 and 2. But node 5 is 0, so node 35 can't be 0. Assign color 2. Then node 35's color is 2. So node 29 is 1, node 35 is 2. That works.\n\nBut this requires changing node 20's color from 1 to 2. Let's adjust that.\n\nSo in this case, node 20 was initially color 1. Let's change it to 2. Then node 29 can be 1. Then node 35 can be 2.\n\nBut this affects other nodes connected to node 20. Node 20 is connected to 16 (color 0) and 29 (color 1). So no conflict.\n\nNow, node 35 is color 2. Check its neighbors:\n\n- 12 (color 1), 5 (0), 29 (1). All different.\n\nSo node 35 is color 2, no conflict.\n\nNow, node 29 is color 1. Its neighbors:\n\n- 3 (0), 20 (2),5 (0),35 (2). No conflicts.\n\nNow, node 35 is 2. Node 5 is 0. That's okay.\n\nSo this adjustment fixes the earlier conflict. So the error came from assigning node 29 as 2 and node 35 as 2, which are connected. So by changing node 20's color to 2, node 29 can be 1, allowing node 35 to be 2.\n\nThis shows the complexity of manual assignment. Let's try to track all changes.\n\nAnother possible conflict is node 25, which is color 2. Node 25 is connected to node 24 (color 0), node 6 (color 1), and node 2 (color 0). So node 25's color 2 is okay.\n\nNode 26 is color 2. Connected to 7 (0),4 (1),17 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 28 is color 2. Connected to 6 (1), 32 (1), 37 (0),10 (0). So no conflict.\n\nNode 32 is color 1. Connected to 11 (0),28 (2),14 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 35 is color 2, connected to 29 (1),12 (1),5 (0). Okay.\n\nAnother possible issue is node 17, color 0. It's connected to 21 (color 1) and 26 (color 2). So okay.\n\nNode 21 is color 1, connected to 0 (0) and 17 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 18 is color 2, connected to 1 (1),6 (1),14 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 33 is color 2, connected to 0 (0),12 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 36 is color 0, connected to 4 (1),12 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 37 is color 0, connected to 12 (1),28 (2). Okay.\n\nLet me check node 7: color 0, connected to 26 (color 2). Okay.\n\nNode 8: color 0, connected to 15 (color 2). Okay.\n\nNode 9: color 0, connected to 19 (color 1). Okay.\n\nNode 10: color 0, connected to 28 (color 2). Okay.\n\nNode 11: color 0, connected to 32 (color 1),31 (color 1),30 (color 1). Wait, node 11's color is 0. Its neighbors are 32 (1), 31 (1), and 30 (1). So okay.\n\nNode 30: color 1, connected to 3 (0) and 11 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 31: color 1, connected to 0 (0) and 11 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 34: color 1, connected to 5 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 37: color 0, connected to 12 (1),28 (2). Okay.\n\nNode 22 and 23: color 0, no neighbors. Okay.\n\nNode 27: color 0. Okay.\n\nNode 13: color 0. Okay.\n\nNode 14: color 0, connected to 18 (2) and 32 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 19: color 1, connected to 5 (0),9 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 34: color 1, connected to 5 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 16: color 0, connected to 20 (2). Okay.\n\nNode 20: color 2, connected to 16 (0),29 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 24: color 0, connected to 4 (1),25 (2). Okay.\n\nNode 25: color 2, connected to 2 (0),6 (1),24 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 26: color 2, connected to 7 (0),4 (1),17 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 28: color 2, connected to 6 (1),32 (1),37 (0),10 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 29: color 1, connected to 3 (0),20 (2),5 (0),35 (2). Okay.\n\nNode 30: color 1, connected to 3 (0),11 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 31: color 1, connected to 0 (0),11 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 32: color 1, connected to 11 (0),28 (2),14 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 33: color 2, connected to 0 (0),12 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 35: color 2, connected to 29 (1),12 (1),5 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 36: color 0, connected to 4 (1),12 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 37: color 0, connected to 12 (1),28 (2). Okay.\n\nOkay, after adjusting node 20 to color 2 and node 29 to color 1, and node 35 to color 2, the conflicts are resolved. Now, all nodes are assigned colors without adjacent duplicates. Also, all three colors (0,1,2) are used.

The goal is to assign colors to each node using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2) such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. First, I need to understand the structure of the graph based on the given edges.\n\nLet me start by listing all the edges to see the connections. Let's parse each edge pair and note the adjacent nodes. Maybe I can build an adjacency list for each node. \n\nLooking at the edges:\n2 - 27, 24 - 27, 2 - 33, 0 - 39, 25 - 38, 1 - 34, 4 - 12, 35 - 39, 3 - 10, 29 - 38, 5 - 25, 1 - 3, 17 - 30, 0 - 23, 8 - 27, 16 - 22, 7 - 19, 32 - 36, 7 - 28, 24 - 38, 26 - 38, 23 - 24, 5 - 12, 20 - 34, 1 - 11, 9 - 28, 3 - 36, 10 - 23, 5 - 27, 1 - 14, 15 - 16, 10 - 35, 21 - 23, 21 - 32, 22 - 33, 14 - 32, 23 - 32, 14 - 35, 5 - 32, 9 - 24, 13 - 21.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of edges. Let me build the adjacency list step by step.\n\nStarting with node 0: connected to 39 and 23.\nNode 1: connected to 34, 3, 11, 14. So 1's neighbors are 34,3,11,14.\nNode 2: connected to 27,33.\nNode3: connected to 10,36,1,36 (wait, 3 - 10, 3-36, 1-3, 3-36 again? So maybe just 10, 36, 1). So 3's neighbors are 10, 1, 36.\nNode4: connected to 12.\nNode5: connected to 25,12,27,32. Neighbors are 25,12,27,32.\nNode6: Not mentioned, so maybe no edges. Wait, the nodes go from 0 to 39, but the edges list skips some. Wait, the problem states nodes 0 through 39. So all 40 nodes. But edges listed might leave some nodes isolated. For example, node 6 isn't in any edge, so it's isolated. So color can be assigned any, but since we need to use exactly 3 colors, but in the coloring, we can choose any color for isolated nodes as long as the total colors used are exactly 3. But the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\", which probably means that all three colors must be used somewhere. Wait, no, the exact wording is \"using exactly 3 colors specified\". So the colors are numbered 0-2, and each node must be assigned one of those three. So even isolated nodes can be assigned any of the three, but adjacent nodes must differ.\n\nSo for node 6, since it's not connected to anyone, we can choose any color. But perhaps assign 0, 1, or 2 as needed. But in any case, the main challenge is the connected nodes.\n\nNow, perhaps the best approach is to process each node, assign the lowest possible color that's not used by its neighbors. But since the graph might have cycles or complex structures, maybe a backtracking approach is needed, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, using a greedy algorithm with some order, like ordering nodes by degree.\n\nAlternatively, look for cliques or higher-degree nodes first. Let me check which nodes have the highest degrees.\n\nLooking through the edges, let's count the degree of each node.\n\nFor example, node 5 is connected to 25,12,27,32 (so degree 4?), but let's check the edges again:\n\nEdges involving node 5: 5-25,5-12,5-27,5-32. So four edges. So degree 4.\n\nSimilarly, node23: connected to 0,24,10,21,32. Let's check the edges:\n\n0-23,23-24,10-23,21-23,23-32. So that's five edges. So node23 has degree 5.\n\nNode32: connected to 36,21,14,23,5. Let's see: 32-36,21-32,14-32,23-32,5-32. So five edges. So degree 5.\n\nSo nodes 23 and 32 have high degrees. Also, node38 is connected to 25,29,24,26. Let's see edges:25-38,29-38,24-38,26-38. So four edges. Degree 4.\n\nNode24: connected to 27,38,23,9. 24-27,24-38,23-24,9-24. So four edges.\n\nNode10: connected to3,23,35. Edges:3-10,10-23,10-35. So three edges.\n\nHmm. So node23 and 32 are high-degree nodes. So maybe start with them.\n\nBut in a greedy coloring, it's best to color the highest-degree nodes first. So perhaps order the nodes in descending order of degree and then assign colors.\n\nAlternatively, check if the graph is 3-colorable. Since the problem states that a valid coloring exists with exactly 3 colors, but we need to find it.\n\nLet me try to approach step by step.\n\nFirst, list all nodes and their adjacency lists.\n\nLet's start by building the adjacency list for each node. This might take some time, but it's necessary.\n\nStarting from node 0:\n\nEdges: 0-39, 0-23. So neighbors are 39,23.\n\nNode1: edges 1-34,1-3,1-11,1-14. So neighbors 34,3,11,14.\n\nNode2: edges 2-27,2-33. Neighbors 27,33.\n\nNode3: edges 3-10,3-36,1-3. So neighbors 10,36,1.\n\nNode4: edges 4-12. Neighbor 12.\n\nNode5: edges 5-25,5-12,5-27,5-32. Neighbors 25,12,27,32.\n\nNode6: no edges. Isolated.\n\nNode7: edges7-19,7-28. Neighbors 19,28.\n\nNode8: edges8-27. Neighbor 27.\n\nNode9: edges9-28,9-24. Neighbors 28,24.\n\nNode10: edges3-10,10-23,10-35. Neighbors3,23,35.\n\nNode11: edges1-11. Neighbor1.\n\nNode12: edges4-12,5-12. Neighbors4,5.\n\nNode13: edges13-21.

Isolated.\n\nNode19: edges7-19. Neighbor7.\n\nNode20: edges20-34. Neighbor34.\n\nNode21: edges21-23,21-32,13-21. Neighbors23,32,13.\n\nNode22: edges16-22,22-33.

Neighbors5,38.\n\nNode26: edges26-38. Neighbor38.\n\nNode27: edges2-27,8-27,5-27,24-27. Neighbors2,8,5,24.\n\nNode28: edges7-28,9-28. Neighbors7,9.\n\nNode29: edges29-38. Neighbor38.\n\nNode30: edges17-30. Neighbor17.\n\nNode31: no edges. Isolated.\n\nNode32: edges32-36,21-32,14-32,23-32,5-32. Neighbors36,21,14,23,5.\n\nNode33: edges2-33,22-33. Neighbors2,22.\n\nNode34: edges1-34,20-34. Neighbors1,20.\n\nNode35: edges35-39,10-35,14-35. Neighbors39,10,14.\n\nNode36: edges3-36,32-36. Neighbors3,32.\n\nNode37: no edges. Isolated.\n\nNode38: edges25-38,29-38,24-38,26-38. Neighbors25,29,24,26.\n\nNode39: edges0-39,35-39. Neighbors0,35.\n\nNode40: Wait, the nodes are listed up to 39. So 40 nodes total (0-39). But the initial list includes up to 39.\n\nNow, with the adjacency list, I can proceed to assign colors.\n\nA common strategy is to use a greedy algorithm, processing nodes in a certain order and assigning the smallest possible color not used by their already colored neighbors.\n\nHowever, since some nodes are connected in a way that might require backtracking, but given that the problem states that a 3-coloring is possible, perhaps a greedy approach with the right order will suffice.\n\nTo minimize color conflicts, maybe process nodes in order of decreasing degree. Let's list nodes by degree:\n\nNodes with highest degree:\n\n- Node23: degree 5.\n\n- Node32: degree5.\n\nThen node27: connected to 2,8,5,24. Degree4.\n\nNode38: degree4 (connected to25,29,24,26).\n\nNode5: degree4.\n\nNode10: degree3.\n\nNode3: degree3.\n\nNode24: degree4.\n\nLet me create a list of nodes sorted by degree in descending order:\n\n23 (5), 32 (5), 27 (4), 38 (4), 5 (4), 24 (4), 10 (3),3 (3),35 (3), 14 (3), etc.\n\nProcessing in this order might help.\n\nLet's start with node23. Assign color 0.\n\nThen node32. Its neighbors include 23 (color0), so cannot use 0. Assign the next available, color1.\n\nNext, node27. Its neighbors are 2,8,5,24. None of these have been colored yet. Wait, but in the order, we're processing higher degree nodes first. Wait, maybe the order is node23,32, then 27, etc. So when processing node27, its neighbors (2,8,5,24) may not have been colored yet.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is not optimal. Because if a node's neighbors are processed later, then we can't check their colors. So maybe a better approach is to order nodes in reverse order of degree (highest first), but during coloring, for each node, check the colors of already colored neighbors. So the neighbors that have higher priority (i.e., were colored earlier) would have their colors set, and the current node can pick a color not used by those neighbors. But neighbors processed later don't affect the current node's color choice.\n\nSo, perhaps processing in order of highest degree first. Let's proceed.\n\nInitialize all colors as unassigned (-1).\n\nOrder of processing: 23,32,38,27,5,24, etc.\n\nLet's start:\n\n1. Node23: assign color 0.\n\n2. Node32: neighbors are 36,21,14,23,5. So neighbors processed so far: only node23 (color0). So available colors: 1,2. Assign color1.\n\n3. Next, node38. Its neighbors are 25,29,24,26. None have been colored yet. So assign color0.\n\n4. Next node27. Neighbors are 2,8,5,24. Not colored yet. Assign color0.\n\nWait, but node27 is connected to 24 (in the next steps). But 24 hasn't been colored yet. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps process in the order of nodes with the most constraints. Alternatively, check if any nodes form a clique.\n\nAlternatively, let's try the following approach:\n\nStart by coloring the most connected nodes first.\n\nNode23: color0.\n\nNow, node32 is connected to node23 (0), so cannot be 0. Assign color1.\n\nNext, node38: not connected to 23 or 32. So assign color0.\n\nNode27: connected to 23 (0), but 23's color is 0. Wait, node27 is connected to node24 (which is connected to 23). But node24 is not colored yet. Wait, node27's neighbors are 2,8,5,24. None of them are colored yet. So node27 can take color0. But wait, node23 is not connected to node27. Wait, no, node23's edges: 0-23, 10-23, 21-23, 23-24, 23-32. So node23 is connected to node24, which is connected to node27. So node23 is not directly connected to node27. So node27 is not a neighbor of node23. Therefore, node27 can take color0.\n\nBut then, when node24 is processed (connected to node27), it cannot take color0 if node27 is color0.\n\nHmm. Let's proceed step by step.\n\n1. Node23: color0.\n\n2. Node32: neighbors include 23 (color0), so assign color1.\n\n3. Node38: no colored neighbors yet. Assign color0.\n\n4. Node27: assign color0.\n\n5. Node5: connected to 25,12,27,32. So neighbors processed so far:27 (color0),32 (color1). So available colors: 2. Assign color2.\n\n6. Node24: connected to27 (color0),38 (color0),23 (color0),9. So processed neighbors are 27,38,23. All color0. So must choose color1 or 2. Assign color1.\n\n7. Node10: neighbors are3 (not colored yet),23 (color0),35 (not colored). So current neighbors with color are 23 (0). Assign color1.\n\n8. Node3: neighbors are10 (color1),36 (not colored),1 (not colored). Assign color0.\n\n9. Node35: neighbors are39 (not colored),10 (color1),14 (not colored). Assign color0.\n\n10. Node14: neighbors are1 (not colored),32 (color1),35 (color0). So available colors: 2. Assign color2.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe this approach is not the best. Let's try another way.\n\nAlternatively, pick a node and assign colors step by step, checking all constraints.\n\nAlternatively, use backtracking with some order. But since this is a thought process, perhaps a better way is to find a possible assignment.\n\nAlternatively, look for the nodes with the most connections and assign colors first.\n\nLet's start by coloring node23 (high degree). Assign color0.\n\nNow, node23's neighbors:0,10,21,24,32.\n\nThese nodes can't be color0.\n\nNext, look at node32 (degree5). Assign color1.\n\nNow, node32's neighbors:36,21,14,23 (0),5. So node32 is color1. So 36,21,14,5 can't be 1.\n\nNext, node5: connected to25,12,27,32 (color1). So node5 can't be 1. Assign color0. But check if any of its neighbors have color0.\n\nWait, node25 is connected to5. So if node5 is 0, then node25 can't be 0. Similarly for 12,27,32 (32 is 1).\n\nBut maybe node5 can be color0. Let's try:\n\nnode5: color0.\n\nNext, node25: connected to5 (0),38. So can't be 0.\n\nnode38: connected to25,29,24,26. Let's assign color0 to node38.\n\nBut then node25 (connected to38 (0)) can be color1.\n\nThen node25: color1.\n\nNow, node38's other neighbors (29,24,26) can't be 0.\n\nnode24: connected to27,38 (0),23 (0),9. So node24 can't be 0. Assign color1.\n\nnode24: color1.\n\nnode27: connected to2,8,5 (0),24 (1). So node27's neighbors 5 (0) and 24 (1). So possible colors:2. Assign color2.\n\nNow, node27 is 2.\n\nnode2: connected to27 (2) and 33. So node2 can't be 2. Assign 0 or 1.\n\nLet's assign node2:0.\n\nnode33: connected to2 (0),22. So node33 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nnode22: connected to16 and 33 (1). So node22 can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\nnode16: connected to22 (0) and15. So node16 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nnode15: connected to16 (1). Assign 0.\n\nThis is going step by step.\n\nContinuing:\n\nnode0: connected to39 and23 (0). So can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nnode39: connected to0 (1) and35. So node39 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nnode35: connected to39 (0),10,14. So node35 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nnode10: connected to3,23 (0),35 (1). So can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\nnode3: connected to10 (2),36,1. Assign 0 (since not conflicting with 2).\n\nnode36: connected to3 (0) and32 (1). Assign 2.\n\nnode32's color was 1. So node36 is 2.\n\nnode14: connected to1,32 (1),35 (1). So node14 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2.\n\nCheck if any other constraints. Suppose node14 is 0.\n\nBut node35 is 1, so node14 can be 0.\n\nnode1: connected to34,3 (0),11,14 (0). So node1 can't be 0. Assign 1 or 2.\n\nAssign node1:1.\n\nnode34: connected to1 (1) and20. Assign 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nnode20: connected to34 (0). Assign 1.\n\nnode11: connected to1 (1). Assign 0.\n\nnode9: connected to28 and24 (1). Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nnode28: connected to7 and9 (0). Assign 1.\n\nnode7: connected to19 and28 (1). Assign 0.\n\nnode19: connected to7 (0). Assign 1.\n\nnode8: connected to27 (2). Assign 0 or 1. Assign 0.\n\nnode12: connected to4 and5 (0). Assign 1.\n\nnode4: connected to12 (1). Assign 0.\n\nnode17: connected to30. Assign 0.\n\nnode30: connected to17 (0). Assign 1.\n\nnode13: connected to21. Assign 0.\n\nnode21: connected to23 (0),32 (1),13 (0). So can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\nnode26: connected to38 (0). Assign 1.\n\nnode29: connected to38 (0). Assign 1.\n\nnode6: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nnode18: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nnode31: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nnode37: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nnode37 is in the list (nodes 0-39). So assign 0.\n\nnode37:0.\n\nNow, let's check for conflicts.\n\nCheck node23 (color0) and its neighbors:\n\n0:1 (okay),10:2 (okay),21:2 (okay),24:1 (okay),32:1 (okay). All different from 0. Good.\n\nnode32 (color1) neighbors:36:2 (okay),21:2 (okay),14:0 (okay),23:0 (okay),5:0 (okay). All different.\n\nnode5 (color0): connected to25:1 (okay),12:1 (okay),27:2 (okay),32:1 (okay).

Different.\n\nnode36 (color2): connected to3:0 (okay),32:1 (okay). Different.\n\nAll other nodes (6,18,31,37) are isolated and assigned 0. Since they have no edges, their color is okay.\n\nLet me check if there are any other possible conflicts I missed.\n\nFor example, node21 is color2. Check its neighbors:23 (0),32 (1),13 (0). All different.\n\nnode32 (1) connected to5 (0) is okay.\n\nnode22 (0) connected to33 (1). Okay.\n\nnode33 (1) connected to2 (0) and 22 (0). Okay.\n\nnode2 (0) connected to27 (2) and33 (1). Okay.\n\nnode33's color is 1.\n\nnode22's color is0.\n\nnode16 (1) connected to15 (0) and 22 (0). Okay.\n\nnode15 (0) connected to16 (1). Okay.\n\nnode17 (0) connected to30 (1).

Okay.\n\nnode4 (0) connected to12 (1). Okay.\n\nnode12 (1) connected to4 (0) and5 (0). Okay.\n\nnode5 (0) connected to12 (1). Okay.\n\nnode25 (1) connected to5 (0) and38 (0). Both different. Okay.\n\nnode38 (0) connected to25 (1),29 (1),24 (1),26 (1). All different from 0.\n\nnode25 (1) is okay.\n\nnode35 (1) connected to39 (0),10 (2),14 (0). All different.\n\nnode10 (2) connected to3 (0),23 (0),35 (1). Wait, node10 is color2, connected to3 (0),23 (0), and 35 (1). So 0,0,1. So 23 is 0. 10 is 2, so that's okay. No conflict.\n\nYes, this seems to work. All nodes are assigned a color different from their adjacent nodes. Also, all three colors (0,1,2) are used. For example, nodes are 0 (1), 1 (1), 2 (0), etc. So the coloring uses all three colors.\n\nNow, I need to compile this into a list of [node, color] pairs for all 40 nodes, ordered from 0 to 39.\n\nLet me list them all:\n\n0:1 (from earlier assignment)\n\n1:1\n\nWait, wait. Wait, node0 was assigned color1, node1:1, node2:0, node3:0, node4:0, node5:0, node6:0, node7:0, node8:0, node9:0, node10:2, node11:0, node12:1, node13:0, node14:0, node15:0, node16:1, node17:0, node18:0, node19:1, node20:1, node21:2, node22:0, node23:0, node24:1, node25:1, node26:1, node27:2, node28:1, node29:1, node30:1, node31:0, node32:1, node33:1, node34:0, node35:1, node36:2, node37:0, node38:0, node39:0.\n\nWait, let me recheck each node's color as per earlier steps:\n\nnode0: color1 (from step 10: node0 connected to39 and23 (0).

So, we have 26 nodes (0 to 25) and a list of edges. The goal is to color them using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2) such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. Alright, first step is to understand the structure of the graph by looking at the edges provided.\n\nLet me start by listing out all the edges to see if there are any patterns or highly connected nodes. The edges are:\n\n7-20,\n4-21,\n14-22,\n5-25,\n17-24,\n9-23,\n13-23,\n13-20,\n6-17,\n4-8,\n8-11,\n2-4,\n8-14,\n4-23,\n0-13,\n0-19,\n8-20,\n10-20,\n2-25,\n7-15,\n3-11,\n17-19,\n5-23,\n4-25,\n19-25,\n11-21,\n13-18\n\nHmm. Let me note which nodes have the most connections. Node 4 is connected to 21, 8, 2, 23, 25. Wait, let's count:\n\nLooking at the edges, node 4 is connected to 21, 2, 8, 23, 25. So that's five edges. Node 8 is connected to 4, 11, 14, 20. Four edges. Node 20 is connected to 7, 13, 8, 10. Also four edges. Node 13 is connected to 23, 20, 0, 18. Four edges. Node 23 is connected to 9, 13, 4, 5. Four edges. Node 25 is connected to 5, 2, 4, 19. Four edges. So nodes 4, 8, 20, 13, 23, 25 are the more connected ones. These might be the ones that require careful coloring since they have higher degrees.\n\nSince the graph isn't too large, maybe I can approach this step by step. Let's start assigning colors to the nodes with the highest degrees first, ensuring their neighbors have different colors.\n\nStarting with node 4. It's connected to 21, 2, 8, 23, 25. Let's assign color 0 to node 4. Then its neighbors (21, 2, 8, 23, 25) can't be 0. So each of them needs to be either 1 or 2, but ensuring that their own adjacent nodes don't conflict.\n\nNext, node 8. Since 8 is connected to 4 (0), it can't be 0. Let's assign color 1 to node 8. Then its neighbors: 4 (0), 11, 14, 20. So 11,14,20 can't be 1. \n\nNode 20 is connected to 7, 13, 8 (1), 10. So 20 can't be 1. Let's assign color 0 to node 20. But wait, node 8 is color 1, so 20 can be 0, 2. Let's pick 0. Then its neighbors (7,13,8,10) can't be 0. So 7,13,10 can't be 0.\n\nNode 13 is connected to 23, 20 (0), 0, 18. So 13 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Then its neighbors (23, 20 (already 0), 0, 18) can't be 1. So 0 must be a color different from 1. Let's assign 0 to node 0. Wait, node 0 is connected to 13 (1) and 19. So node 0 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 0 to node 0. Then 19, connected to 0 (0), so 19 can't be 0.\n\nNode 23 is connected to 9, 13 (1), 4 (0), 5. So 23 can't be 0 or 1. So color 2. Then 23's neighbors 9,13 (1),4 (0),5 can't be 2. So 9 and 5 must be different from 2.\n\nNode 25 is connected to 5, 2, 4 (0), 19. Since 4 is 0, 25 can't be 0. Let's assign color 1 to 25. Then its neighbors 5, 2, 4 (0), 19 can't be 1. So 5 and 2 must not be 1. But 2 is connected to 4 (0) and 25 (1), so node 2 can be 2. Assign color 2 to node 2. Then 4 (0) and 25 (1) are okay. Wait, node 2 is connected to 4 (0) and 25 (1), so colors 0 and 1 are taken, so 2 can be color 2. Yes.\n\nNode 5 is connected to 25 (1) and 23 (2). So 5 can't be 1 or 2. So color 0. Assign 0 to node 5. Then its neighbors 25 (1) and 23 (2) are okay.\n\nNode 21 is connected to 4 (0) and 11. So node 21 can't be 0. Let's assign color 1. Then 11 is connected to 8 (1) and 21 (1). Wait, 8 is color 1, so 11 can't be 1. So 11's color has to be different. Wait, node 8 is connected to 11, which is color 1. So 11 can't be 1. So 11 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign color 0 to node 11. Then 8 (1) is okay, and 21 (1) is also okay (since 11 is 0, 21 is 1, so edge between 21 and 11: 11 is 0, 21 is 1, so that's okay). Wait, but the edge 11-21 is present. So 11 and 21 must be different. If 21 is 1 and 11 is 0, that's okay. So that's acceptable.\n\nNode 21 is color 1, connected to 4 (0) and 11 (0). Wait, 21 and 11 are connected, so their colors must be different. Oh wait, if 21 is 1 and 11 is 0, that's okay. Correct. Because they're different. So 21 (1) and 11 (0) are fine.\n\nSo far:\n\n4:0\n\n8:1\n\n20:0\n\n13:1\n\n23:2\n\n25:1\n\n2:2\n\n5:0\n\n21:1\n\n11:0\n\n0:0\n\nNow node 19 is connected to 0 (0), 17, and 25 (1). So 19 can't be 0 or 1. So color 2. Assign 2 to 19. Then 17 is connected to 19 (2), 24, 6, 19. Wait, the edges: 17 is connected to 24, 6, 19 (19 is 2). So 17 can't be 2. Let's handle node 17 later.\n\nNode 7 is connected to 20 (0) and 15. So 7 can't be 0. Assign color 1 to node 7. Then 15 connected to 7 (1) can't be 1.\n\nNode 15: connected to 7 (1). Can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nNode 10 connected to 20 (0). Can be 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode 14 connected to 22, 8 (1). So 14 can't be 1. Assign 0. Then node 22 connected to 14 (0) can be 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode 9 connected to 23 (2). So 9 can be 0 or 1. Assign 0.\n\nNode 3 connected to 11 (0). So 3 can be 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode 6 connected to 17. Let's see. Node 6 is connected to 17. Let's come back to 17. Maybe assign 0 to 6 first. Then 17's color must differ.\n\nNode 17 is connected to 24, 6, and 19 (2). So 17 can't be 2. Also, if 6 is 0, then 17 can't be 0. So color 1. Assign 1 to 17. Then 24 connected to 17 (1) can be 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nNode 18 connected to 13 (1). So 18 can be 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nNode 1 hasn't been mentioned yet. Wait, the nodes are 0-25. Let's check which nodes are left. So far, nodes assigned:\n\n0:0\n\n2:2\n\n3:1\n\n4:0\n\n5:0\n\n6:0?\n\nWait, no. Let me list all nodes and check which are missing.\n\nNodes 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25.\n\nWait, node 12 and node 16 haven't been mentioned in the edges. So they are isolated? Because in the edge list, I don't see any edges involving 12 or 16. So they can be colored any color, as they have no connections. So their colors can be 0,1, or 2. Let's assign 0 to both.\n\nSo node 12:0, node16:0.\n\nNow, let's check node 17. Earlier, I assigned node17:1. Let's confirm. 17 is connected to 6 (0?), 19 (2), and 24 (0). Wait, node 6's color hasn't been set yet. Let me check. Earlier, node6 is connected to 17. So node6's color can't be the same as 17.\n\nIf node17 is assigned 1, then node6 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign node6:0. Then 17 can be 1.\n\nWait, node6 is connected to 17. So if 6 is 0, 17 can be 1. Then node17's neighbors: 6 (0), 19 (2), and 24 (0). So 17 can't be 0 or 2. So 1 is correct.\n\nNode17:1.\n\nNode24:0 (connected to 17 (1)).\n\nNow, node6:0.\n\nCheck remaining nodes:\n\nNode 1: no edges. Assign 0.\n\nNode12:0.\n\nNode16:0.\n\nNode22:1 (connected to 14 (0)).\n\nNode14:0 (connected to 8 (1) and 22 (1)).\n\nNode3:1 (connected to 11 (0)).\n\nNode10:1 (connected to 20 (0)).\n\nNode7:1 (connected to 20 (0) and 15 (0)).\n\nNode15:0 (connected to7 (1)).\n\nNode9:0 (connected to23 (2)).\n\nNode18:0 (connected to13 (1)).\n\nLet me check for conflicts:\n\nCheck node4's connections:\n\n4 (0) connected to 21 (1), 8 (1), 2 (2), 23 (2), 25 (1). All different. Good.\n\nNode8 (1) connected to 4 (0), 11 (0), 14 (0), 20 (0). So 8 is 1, others are 0. All good.\n\nWait, node8's edges: 4-8 (4 is 0, 8 is1), 8-11 (11 is0), 8-14 (14 is0), 8-20 (20 is0). All okay.\n\nNode20 (0) connected to7 (1),13 (1),8 (1),10 (1). All different. Good.\n\nNode13 (1) connected to23 (2),20 (0),0 (0),18 (0). All okay.\n\nNode23 (2) connected to9 (0),13 (1),4 (0),5 (0). All different. Good.\n\nNode25 (1) connected to5 (0),2 (2),4 (0),19 (2). All different.\n\nNode2 (2) connected to4 (0) and25 (1). Good.\n\nNode5 (0) connected to25 (1) and23 (2). Correct.\n\nNode21 (1) connected to4 (0) and11 (0). Wait, 21 (1) and11 (0) are connected. That's okay.\n\nNode11 (0) connected to8 (1) and21 (1), and3 (1). All different.\n\nNode3 (1) connected to11 (0). Correct.\n\nNode0 (0) connected to13 (1) and19 (2). Correct.\n\nNode19 (2) connected to0 (0),17 (1),25 (1). Correct.\n\nNode7 (1) connected to20 (0) and15 (0). Correct.\n\nNode15 (0) connected to7 (1). Correct.\n\nNode10 (1) connected to20 (0). Correct.\n\nNode14 (0) connected to8 (1) and22 (1). Correct.\n\nNode22 (1) connected to14 (0). Correct.\n\nNode9 (0) connected to23 (2). Correct.\n\nNode6 (0) connected to17 (1). Correct.\n\nNode17 (1) connected to6 (0),19 (2),24 (0). Correct.\n\nNode24 (0) connected to17 (1). Correct.\n\nNode18 (0) connected to13 (1). Correct.\n\nNodes 1,12,16: all isolated, color 0. No conflicts.\n\nNow, check any missing nodes.\n\nNode12 is 0.\n\nNode16 is 0.\n\nNode1 is 0.\n\nThat's all.\n\nNow, let's list all nodes with their colors:\n\n0:0\n\n1:0\n\n2:2\n\n3:1\n\n4:0\n\n5:0\n\n6:0\n\n7:1\n\n8:1\n\n9:0\n\n10:1\n\n11:0\n\n12:0\n\n13:1\n\n14:0\n\n15:0\n\n16:0\n\n17:1\n\n18:0\n\n19:2\n\n20:0\n\n21:1\n\n22:1\n\n23:2\n\n24:0\n\n25:1\n\nWait, but node23 is 2, and node19 is 2. Are there any edges between them? Let me check the edges list. The edges include 19-25. Node23's edges: 9-23,13-23,4-23,5-23. No edge between 19 and23. So their colors being same is okay.\n\nNow, check node19: connected to0 (0),17 (1),25 (1). So 19 is 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother check: node22 is color1, connected to14 (0). Correct.\n\nNode14 is color0, connected to8 (1) and22 (1). Correct.\n\nNode17 color1, connected to6 (0),19 (2),24 (0). Correct.\n\nNode6 color0, connected to17 (1). Correct.\n\nNode24 color0 connected to17 (1). Correct.\n\nNode9 color0 connected to23 (2). Correct.\n\nNode5 color0 connected to23 (2) and25 (1). Correct.\n\nNode25 color1 connected to5 (0),2 (2),4 (0),19 (2). Correct.\n\nAll edges seem to be properly handled. Now, the only thing is that the problem states to use exactly 3 colors. In the current assignment, colors used are 0,1,2. So that's correct. However, let's confirm that all three colors are actually used. In the list above:\n\nColors present:\n\n0 (many nodes: 0,1,4,5,6,9,11,12,14,15,16,18,20,24)\n\n1 (nodes 3,7,8,10,13,17,21,22,25)\n\n2 (nodes 2,19,23)\n\nSo yes, all three colors are used. Good.\n\nBut wait, node19 is color2, which is used only in a few nodes. But that's okay.\n\nNow, to make sure that nodes with no edges (like 1,12,16) can be colored with 0. Since they have no edges, they can be any color. Assigning them 0 is fine.\n\nThus, the final coloring should be valid.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0,0],[1,0],[2,2],[3,1],[4,0],[5,0],[6,0],[7,1],[8,1],[9,0],[10,1],[11,0],[12,0],[13,1],[14,0],[15,0],[16,0],[17,1],[18,0],[19,2],[20,0],[21,1],[22,1],[23,2],[24,0],[25,1]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

So, the task is to assign colors to each node using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2) such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. Let me start by understanding the structure of the graph based on the edges provided.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges to get a clearer picture:\n\nEdges:\n6-12, 8-9, 9-14, 0-5, 2-8, 2-14, 7-10, 6-8, 6-14, 4-11, 3-15, 8-11, 0-10, 12-14, 3-8, 5-11, 5-8, 2-3, 7-8\n\nLooking at these edges, some nodes seem to have multiple connections. Let's note down the neighbors for each node to see which ones might be more constrained.\n\nStarting with node 8. It has edges to 9, 2, 6, 11, 5, 3, 7. That's a lot of connections. Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 6, 11, 5, 3, 7, and 8 itself? Wait, no, the edges are to other nodes. Wait, 8 is connected to 9, 2, 6, 11, 5, 3, 7. So node 8 has seven edges. That's a high degree node. Similarly, node 2 is connected to 8, 14, 3. Node 6 is connected to 12, 8, 14. Node 5 has edges to 0, 11, 8. Node 3 is connected to 15, 8, 2. Node 14 is connected to 9, 2, 6, 12. Node 8 is definitely a hub here.\n\nSince node 8 has so many edges, its color choice will affect many others. Let's plan to assign color 0 to node 8. Then all its neighbors (9,2,6,11,5,3,7) must use colors 1 or 2.\n\nLet's list the neighbors of each node:\n\nNode 0: connected to 5, 10\nNode 1: no edges? Wait, looking back at the edges list. The edges provided don't include node 1. So node 1 is isolated. So its color can be any, but since we have to use exactly 3 colors, but the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\" but perhaps that refers to the maximum number allowed. Wait, the problem states \"using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2)\", so that's three colors total. So nodes can be colored with 0, 1, or 2, and we need to use exactly three colors. Wait, no. The problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\", which I think means that we must use all three colors in the coloring. But maybe the wording is ambiguous, but the usual interpretation is that the number of colors used is at most 3, but here it's saying exactly. Wait, the original problem says: \"using exactly 3 colors\", so the solution must use all three colors. But in some cases, maybe it's possible to color with fewer, but the problem requires using three. Hmm. But maybe the problem is phrased as using exactly 3 colors, meaning that the coloring uses three colors (but not necessarily all three, but the total available is three). Wait, the problem's wording is: \"Provide a valid coloring scheme for the graph using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2).\" So the colors available are 0,1,2. The solution must use these three, but individual nodes can use any of them as long as adjacent nodes are different. So the answer can use all three, but perhaps it's possible to use fewer. But since the question requires using exactly three, perhaps the solution must use all three. Or maybe the question is just specifying that the colors are 0-2, and the answer can use any subset. The original problem statement in the question says: \"using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2).\" So perhaps the 'exactly 3 colors' refers to the number of colors available (i.e., the chromatic number is 3 or lower). But the user wants a valid 3-coloring. So proceed under the assumption that the graph is 3-colorable, and we need to assign colors 0,1,2 such that adjacent nodes have different colors.\n\nBack to the problem. Let's start by assigning colors to the high-degree nodes first. Node 8 is connected to many nodes. Let's assign color 0 to node 8. Then its neighbors (9,2,6,11,5,3,7) must each have colors 1 or 2. Let's process these neighbors.\n\nLet's pick node 9 (connected to 8 and 14). Since 8 is 0, node 9 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 1 to node 9. Then node 14 (connected to 9, 2, 6, 12) must not be 1 (due to 9) and also not the color of its other neighbors.\n\nWait, node 14 is connected to 9 (1), 2 (unknown), 6 (unknown), 12 (unknown). Let's hold that thought.\n\nNext, node 2 is connected to 8 (0), 14, and 3. So node 2 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign color 1 to node 2. Then node 3 (connected to 8 (0) and 2 (1)) can be 2. Then node 3's other neighbor is 15. So node 15 is connected to 3 (2), so it can be 0 or 1.\n\nNow, node 2 is color 1, so node 14 (connected to 2) can't be 1. Also connected to node 9 (1), so 14 can't be 1. So node 14 must be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0 for node 14. Then node 14 is 0. Now, node 12 is connected to 6 and 14 (0). So node 12 can't be 0. If node 6 is connected to 8 (0), 12, and 14 (0). So node 6 must be different from 0 (due to 8) and also from 12's color. Wait, node 6 is connected to 12. So whatever color node 6 gets, node 12 must be different. Let's see. Let's assign color 1 to node 6. Then node 12 can be 2. But node 12 is connected to 14 (0), so node 12 can be 2. So node 6 is 1, node 12 is 2. Then node 8 (0) is okay with 6 (1), and 14 (0) is okay with 6 (1). That works.\n\nNow, node 6's color is 1, connected to 8 (0) and 12 (2), 14 (0).\n\nNext, node 11 is connected to 4, 8 (0), and 5. Let's look at node 11. Since 8 is 0, node 11 can be 1 or 2. Let's see. Node 5 is connected to 0, 11, 8 (0). So node 5's color depends on 0 and 11. Let's assign 1 to node 11. Then node 5 can be 2 (since 8 is 0 and 11 is 1). Node 5's edges are to 0, 11 (1), 8 (0). So node 5 can be 2. Then node 0 is connected to 5 (2) and 10. So node 0 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0 for node 0. Then node 10 (connected to 0 (0) and 7) must be a different color. Let's say node 10 is 1. Then node 7, connected to 8 (0) and 10 (1), can be 2. That works.\n\nSo far:\n\nNodes colored:\n\n8: 0\n\n9: 1 (connected to 8:0, and 14:0)\n\n2:1 (connected to 8:0, 14:0, 3:2)\n\n3:2 (connected to 8:0 and 2:1)\n\n14:0 (connected to 9:1, 2:1, 6:1, 12:2)\n\n6:1 (connected to 8:0, 12:2, 14:0)\n\n12:2 (connected to 6:1, 14:0)\n\n11:1 (connected to 8:0, 4, 5:2)\n\n4: connected to 11:1. So 4 can be 0 or 2. Let's choose 0 for 4.\n\n5:2 (connected to 0:0, 11:1, 8:0)\n\n0:0 (connected to 5:2, 10:1)\n\n10:1 (connected to 0:0, 7:2)\n\n7:2 (connected to 8:0, 10:1)\n\nNow, node 15 is connected to 3:2. So 15 can be 0 or 1. Let's assign 0.\n\nNow, node 1 has no edges. So it can be any color. Let's assign color 0, but maybe to use all three colors, perhaps assign a different color. Let's check if all three colors are used so far. Looking at the colors assigned:\n\n0:0\n\n1: ?\n\n2:1\n\n3:2\n\n4:0\n\n5:2\n\n6:1\n\n7:2\n\n8:0\n\n9:1\n\n10:1\n\n11:1\n\n12:2\n\n13: ?\n\n14:0\n\n15:0\n\nWait, node 13 is present in the list of nodes (nodes 0-15), but there are no edges involving node 13. So node 13 can be colored any of 0,1,2. Let's check if all three colors are used in the current assignments. Let's see:\n\nColors used so far: 0 (nodes 0,8,4,14,15), 1 (nodes 2,6,9,10,11), 2 (nodes 3,5,7,12, etc.). So colors 0,1,2 are all used. So node 1 and 13 can be assigned any color. Let's assign node 1 to color 0, and node 13 to color 1 to spread the colors, but since the problem allows exactly 3 colors, as long as each node is colored with 0,1,2 and adjacent are different.\n\nWait, but node 1 and 13 are isolated. Their colors can be any. Let's assign node 1 as 0 and node 13 as 1. That way, all three colors are used in the entire coloring.\n\nSo compiling the list:\n\n0:0\n\n1:0\n\n2:1\n\n3:2\n\n4:0\n\n5:2\n\n6:1\n\n7:2\n\n8:0\n\n9:1\n\n10:1\n\n11:1\n\n12:2\n\n13:1\n\n14:0\n\n15:0\n\nWait, but node 15 is connected to node 3 (color 2), so 15's color is 0 which is okay.\n\nLet me verify all edges:\n\nCheck edges to ensure no adjacent nodes have same color.\n\nEdge 6-12: 6 is 1, 12 is 2 → okay.\n\n8-9: 8 is 0, 9 is 1 → okay.\n\n9-14: 9 is 1, 14 is 0 → okay.\n\n0-5: 0 is 0, 5 is 2 → okay.\n\n2-8: 2 is 1, 8 is 0 → okay.\n\n2-14: 2 is 1, 14 is 0 → okay.\n\n7-10: 7 is 2, 10 is 1 → okay.\n\n6-8: 6 is 1, 8 is 0 → okay.\n\n6-14: 6 is 1, 14 is 0 → okay.\n\n4-11:4 is 0, 11 is1 → okay.\n\n3-15:3 is2, 15 is0 → okay.\n\n8-11:8 is0, 11 is1 → okay.\n\n0-10:0 is0, 10 is1 → okay.\n\n12-14:12 is2,14 is0 → okay.\n\n3-8:3 is2,8 is0 → okay.\n\n5-11:5 is2,11 is1 → okay.\n\n5-8:5 is2,8 is0 → okay.\n\n2-3:2 is1,3 is2 → okay.\n\n7-8:7 is2,8 is0 → okay.\n\nEdges all checked. Now, nodes 1 and 13 are isolated. Node 1 is 0, node13 is1. That's okay. All colors are valid.\n\nWait, but node 4 is 0 and connected to 11 (1). That's okay.\n\nYes, this seems to work.

Let's start by understanding the structure of the graph. The nodes are from 0 to 22, and the edges are given. My goal is to assign each node a color (0, 1, or 2) such that no two connected nodes share the same color. \n\nFirst, I should list out all the edges to see the connections. Let me parse the edges:\n\nEdges:\n3-7\n5-7\n4-21\n8-12\n11-14\n10-18\n13-14\n20-22\n14-18\n8-11\n0-1\n10-11\n10-14\n13-16\n11-22\n7-9\n6-7\n7-18\n12-14\n0-6\n1-16\n2-15\n\nHmm, okay. Let's see if there's a way to approach this step by step. Maybe I can start by coloring nodes with the highest degrees first since they might be more constrained. Alternatively, I can group nodes that are connected and ensure they have different colors.\n\nLet me try to figure out the connections for each node.\n\nLooking at node 7: connected to 3,5,9,6,18. So node 7 is connected to several nodes. Similarly, node 14 is connected to 11,13,12,10,18. So those are high-degree nodes. Let's note down the degrees:\n\nNode 7: connected to 3,5,6,9,18 (degree 5)\nNode 11: connected to 8,10,14,22 (degree 4)\nNode 14: connected to 11,13,12,10,18 (degree 5)\nNode 10: connected to 11,14,18 (degree 3)\nNode 18: connected to 10,14,7 (degree 3)\nNode 0: connected to 1,6 (degree 2)\nNode 1: connected to 0,16 (degree 2)\nNode 6: connected to 0,7 (degree 2)\nNode 8: connected to 12,11 (degree 2)\nNode 12: connected to 8,14 (degree 2)\nNode 13: connected to 14,16 (degree 2)\nNode 16: connected to 13,1 (degree 2)\nNode 22: connected to 11,20 (degree 2)\nNode 20: connected to 22 (degree 1)\nNode 3: connected to 7 (degree 1)\nNode 5: connected to 7 (degree 1)\nNode 4: connected to 21 (degree 1)\nNode 21: connected to 4 (degree 1)\nNode 9: connected to 7 (degree 1)\nNode 2: connected to 15 (degree 1)\nNode 15: connected to 2 (degree 1)\n\nSo the high-degree nodes are 7,14,11, etc. Let's start with node 7. Assign color 0 to node 7. Then all its neighbors (3,5,6,9,18) can't be color 0.\n\nSo 3,5,6,9,18 need to be colors 1 or 2. Let's handle them one by one.\n\nNext, node 14. Let's assign a different color, say 1. So node 14 is color 1. Its neighbors are 11,13,12,10,18. These can't be 1. So 11,13,12,10,18 need to be 0 or 2. But wait, node 18 is connected to both 7 (color 0) and 14 (color 1), so 18 can't be 0 or 1. So 18 must be color 2. Then node 18 is 2. Now, node 10 is connected to 18 (color 2) and 14 (color 1). So node 10 can't be 1 or 2. So color 0. So node 10 is 0. Then node 10 is connected to 11 and 14. 11 is connected to 14 (color 1), so 11 can't be 1. Since node 10 is color 0, 11 can be 2. So assign 11 to color 2. Then node 11 is connected to 8,10 (0), 14 (1), 22. So 22 can't be 2. Wait, node 11 is color 2. So 22 connected to 11 must be 0 or 1. But node 20-22 is an edge. Let's check that later.\n\nLet's backtrack. So far:\n\n7:0\n14:1\n18:2\n10:0\n11:2\n\nNow, node 8 is connected to 11 (2) and 12. So node 8 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick 0. Then node 12 is connected to 8 (0) and 14 (1). So node 12 can be 2. So 12:2.\n\nNow node 13 is connected to 14 (1), so 13 can be 0 or 2. 13 is also connected to 16. Let's assign 13:0. Then 16 is connected to 13 (0) and 1. Node 1 is connected to 0 and 16. Let's see. Node 1: connected to 0 and 16. So if node 1's color depends on 0 and 16.\n\nNode 0: connected to 1 and 6. Node 6 is connected to 0 and 7 (0). So node 6 can't be 0. Let's assign node 6:1. Then node 0 can't be 1 (because connected to 6) and also can't be same as node 1. Let's see. If node 6 is 1, then node 0 can't be 1. So node 0's possible colors: 0 or 2. Then node 0 is connected to 1. So if node 0 is color 0, then node 1 can't be 0. Similarly, if node 0 is 2, node 1 can't be 2. Let's assign node 0 to color 0. Then node 1 must be a different color. So node 1 can be 1 or 2. But node 1 is connected to 16. Let's handle node 1 after 16.\n\nWait, node 1 is connected to 16. If node 13 is 0, then node 16 is connected to 13 (0). So node 16 can be 1 or 2. If node 1 is assigned color 1, then node 16 can be 2. Let's proceed. Assign node 1:1. Then node 16 can't be 1. So node 16 could be 2. Then node 13 is 0, node 16 is 2. That's okay.\n\nSo far:\n\n7:0\n14:1\n18:2\n10:0\n11:2\n8:0\n12:2\n13:0\n1:1\n0:0\n6:1 (since 0 is connected to 6, which is 1, but wait, 0 is color 0. Node 6 is connected to 7 (0), so 6 can't be 0. So yes, 6:1. Then node 0 is connected to 6 (1), so 0 can't be 1. So 0 can be 0 or 2. Assign 0:0. Then node 1 is connected to 0 (0), so 1 can't be 0. So 1:1 or 2. Assign 1:1, then node 16 can be 2. Node 16 is connected to 13 (0) and 1 (1). So 16:2.\n\nMoving on to node 2, connected to 15. Assign 2:0. Then 15 can be 1. So 15:1.\n\nNode 3 is connected to 7 (0), so 3 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 3:1.\n\nNode 5 is connected to 7 (0), so 5:1 or 2. Let's assign 5:1.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 7 (0), so 9:1 or 2. Assign 9:1.\n\nNode 4 connected to 21. Let's assign 4:0, then 21:1.\n\nNode 20 connected to 22. Node 22 is connected to 11 (2). So 22 can't be 2. Assign 22:0. Then 20:1.\n\nNow, node 22 is color 0. So node 20 connected to 22 must be 1 or 2. Assign 20:1.\n\nNode 17 is not mentioned in any edges. Wait, the nodes are from 0 to 22. Wait, the list of nodes given is 0,1,...,22. Are there any nodes with no edges? Let's check the nodes. The nodes given are 0-22. But edges for node 17? Let me check the edges again. Wait, the edges are listed as:\n\n3-7,5-7,4-21,8-12,11-14,10-18,13-14,20-22,14-18,8-11,0-1,10-11,10-14,13-16,11-22,7-9,6-7,7-18,12-14,0-6,1-16,2-15.\n\nSo node 17 is not connected to any edges. So node 17 is an isolated node. So its color can be 0,1, or 2. Let's assign it 0.\n\nSo node 17:0.\n\nNow, let's check all nodes:\n\n0:0\n1:1\n2:0\n3:1\n4:0\n5:1\n6:1\n7:0\n8:0\n9:1\n10:0\n11:2\n12:2\n13:0\n14:1\n15:1\n16:2\n17:0\n18:2\n19: (Wait, wait! The nodes are 0-22, but in the problem statement, the nodes are listed as 0 through 22 inclusive. So nodes 0 to 22, which is 23 nodes. But in the edges list, I don't see node 19 in any edge. So node 19 is also isolated. Wait, the problem says Nodes: 0,1,...,22. So node 19 is part of the graph. But in the edges list, node 19 is not connected to any edge. So node 19 is isolated.\n\nSo nodes 17,19 are isolated. So their colors can be any of 0,1,2. Let's assign them 0 and 0. Wait, but need to check if that's allowed. Since they are isolated, they don't conflict with anyone. So node 17:0, node 19:0.\n\nWait, but the problem states exactly 3 colors, but since they are isolated, using color 0 for both is okay.\n\nNow, let's list all nodes and their colors:\n\n0:0\n1:1\n2:0\n3:1\n4:0\n5:1\n6:1\n7:0\n8:0\n9:1\n10:0\n11:2\n12:2\n13:0\n14:1\n15:1\n16:2\n17:0\n18:2\n19:0\n20:1\n21:1 (node 4 is 0, connected to 21 which is assigned 1)\n22:0 (since 11 is 2, connected to 22 which is 0; then node 20 is 1, connected to 22 (0) which is okay.)\n\nWait, let's check the edges again to ensure no conflicts:\n\nCheck 3-7: 3 is 1, 7 is 0. Okay.\n\n5-7: 5 is 1, 7 is 0. Okay.\n\n4-21:4 is 0, 21 is 1. Okay.\n\n8-12:8 is 0, 12 is 2. Okay.\n\n11-14:11 is 2,14 is1. Okay.\n\n10-18:10 is0,18 is2. Okay.\n\n13-14:13 is0,14 is1. Okay.\n\n20-22:20 is1,22 is0. Okay.\n\n14-18:14 is1,18 is2. Okay.\n\n8-11:8 is0,11 is2. Okay.\n\n0-1:0 is0,1 is1. Okay.\n\n10-11:10 is0,11 is2. Okay.\n\n10-14:10 is0,14 is1. Okay.\n\n13-16:13 is0,16 is2. Okay.\n\n11-22:11 is2,22 is0. Okay.\n\n7-9:7 is0,9 is1. Okay.\n\n6-7:6 is1,7 is0. Okay.\n\n7-18:7 is0,18 is2. Okay.\n\n12-14:12 is2,14 is1. Okay.\n\n0-6:0 is0,6 is1. Okay.\n\n1-16:1 is1,16 is2. Okay.\n\n2-15:2 is0,15 is1. Okay.\n\nNow, check the isolated nodes:17,19, and 20? Wait, node 20 is connected to 22, which is handled. So nodes 17 and 19 are isolated. Assigned 0. That's okay.\n\nNow, all nodes are colored. Let's check if any color is missing. The colors used are 0,1,2. So that's correct. The problem requires exactly 3 colors.\n\nSo the final answer should be a list of pairs for each node from 0 to 22. Let's compile the list in order.\n\nNodes 0 to 22:\n\n0:0\n1:1\n2:0\n3:1\n4:0\n5:1\n6:1\n7:0\n8:0\n9:1\n10:0\n11:2\n12:2\n13:0\n14:1\n15:1\n16:2\n17:0\n18:2\n19:0\n20:1\n21:1\n22:0\n\nSo the JSON list would be:\n\n[[0,0], [1,1], [2,0], [3,1], [4,0], [5,1], [6,1], [7,0], [8,0], [9,1], [10,0], [11,2], [12,2], [13,0], [14,1], [15,1], [16,2], [17,0], [18,2], [19,0], [20,1], [21,1], [22,0]]\n\n\nAnswer: [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[3,1],[4,0],[5,1],[6,1],[7,0],[8,0],[9,1],[10,0],[11,2],[12,2],[13,0],[14,1],[15,1],[16,2],[17,0],[18,2],[19,0],[20,1],[21,1],[22,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

The graph has 33 nodes (0 to 32) and a bunch of edges. We need to color them using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2). So first, I need to make sure that no two connected nodes share the same color. \n\nHmm, maybe I should start by looking at the edges and see if there are any nodes that are highly connected, which might be tricky. Let's list out the edges to understand the structure.\n\nLooking at the edges, some nodes appear multiple times. For example, node 14 is connected to several nodes: 1, 4, 9, 14-15, 14-18, 14-26, etc. Similarly, node 0 is connected to 5, 15, 18, 28, 31. Node 5 is connected to 0,7,22,29. Node 1 is connected to 9,14,16,31, and so on. \n\nSo, perhaps starting with the most connected nodes would help. Let's see:\n\nNode 14 is connected to nodes 1,4,9,15,18,26. That's six edges. Node 0 has five edges. Node 18 has edges with 0,2,14,30,11. Maybe node 14 is a hub here. \n\nLet me try to assign colors step by step. Let's start by assigning color 0 to node 14. Then all its neighbors (1,4,9,15,18,26) can't be color 0. Let's pick their colors carefully.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to use a greedy algorithm: process nodes in order, assigning the lowest possible color not used by their neighbors. But since the graph isn't provided in a specific order, perhaps I need to process them in a way that ensures we don't get stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe construct a graph structure first and then assign colors. Let's list all the edges again:\n\nEdges:\n16-26\n1-31\n5-7\n20-29\n23-25\n0-5\n9-14\n5-22\n19-21\n1-9\n27-31\n10-30\n15-23\n6-20\n0-18\n20-25\n4-14\n14-18\n14-15\n4-29\n9-19\n19-23\n1-14\n30-32\n9-31\n0-28\n0-31\n18-30\n7-30\n14-26\n0-15\n5-29\n2-18\n1-16\n11-18\n\nWait, perhaps building adjacency lists would help. Let's create an adjacency list for each node.\n\nAdjacency list (node: neighbors):\n\n0: 5, 18, 28, 31, 15\n1: 31,9,14,16\n2: 18\n3: ? (Not in any edges, so node 3 is isolated)\n4: 14,29\n5: 0,7,22,29\n6:20\n7:5,30\n8: (isolated)\n9:14,19,31,1\n10:30\n11:18\n12: (isolated)\n13: (isolated)\n14:9,4,15,18,26,1\n15:23,0,14\n16:26,1\n17: (isolated)\n18:0,14,30,2,11,30 (Wait, the edges list has 0-18, 2-18, 11-18, 14-18, 18-30. So node 18's neighbors: 0,2,11,14,30)\n19:21,9,23\n20:6,29,25\n21:19\n22:5\n23:25,15,19\n24: (isolated)\n25:20,23\n26:14,16\n27:31\n28:0\n29:4,5,20\n30:10,32,18,7,30 (Wait, edges are 10-30, 30-32, 18-30,7-30. So node 30's neighbors:10,32,18,7)\n31:1,27,9,0,31 (Edges:1-31,27-31,9-31,0-31. So 31's neighbors:1,27,9,0)\n32:30\n\nAlso, nodes 3,8,12,13,17,24 are isolated. So for isolated nodes, they can all be color 0, as they have no edges. But since the problem says exactly 3 colors, but maybe the colors can be assigned any as long as adjacent nodes differ. The requirement is to use exactly 3 colors, but the problem probably just requires a proper coloring with at most 3 colors. Wait, no, the question says \"using exactly 3 colors\", which I think means that all three colors must be used. Hmm, but the way the problem is phrased: \"Provide a valid coloring scheme for the graph using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2)\". So the solution must use exactly 3 colors, i.e., all three colors must be used in the coloring. Otherwise, the answer would be invalid. So we need to ensure that at least one node is assigned each of the three colors.\n\nBut perhaps the question is just that the number of colors allowed is 3, and the solution can use any number up to 3. But the wording says \"using exactly 3 colors\". So maybe all three colors must appear in the coloring. So the solution must have at least one node of each color 0,1,2.\n\nThis adds a bit more complexity. So the coloring must be proper (adjacent nodes different) and use all three colors.\n\nBut first, let's focus on creating a proper coloring with at most 3 colors, then check if all three are used, and adjust if necessary.\n\nSo let's proceed step by step. Let's assign colors to nodes, starting with the ones with higher degrees first, as they have more constraints.\n\nLooking at the adjacency list, nodes with the highest degree:\n\nNode 14: degree 6 (connected to 1,4,9,15,18,26)\nNode 18: degree 5 (0,2,11,14,30)\nNode 0: degree 5 (5,18,28,31,15)\nNode 31: degree 4 (1,27,9,0)\nNode 30: degree 4 (10,32,18,7)\nNode 15: degree 3 (23,0,14)\nNode 5: degree 4 (0,7,22,29)\nNode 9: degree 4 (14,19,31,1)\nNode 19: degree 3 (21,9,23)\nNode 20: degree 3 (6,29,25)\nNode 29: degree 3 (4,5,20)\nNode 23: degree 3 (25,15,19)\nNode 7: degree 2 (5,30)\nNode 30: degree 4 (as above)\nOthers have lower degrees.\n\nSo starting with node 14. Let's assign color 0. Then its neighbors (1,4,9,15,18,26) can't be 0.\n\nNext, node 18 (degree 5). Its neighbors are 0,2,11,14,30. Since 14 is color 0, node 18 can be color 1. Then neighbors of 18 (0,2,11,14,30) can't be 1. But 14 is 0, so 0 can be any color except 0 (from 14) and 1 (from 18). Wait, node 0 is connected to 18 (color 1), so node 0 can't be 1. Also, node 0 is connected to 5, 18 (1), 28, 31, 15.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Let's try to proceed step by step.\n\nAssign color 0 to node 14. Then its neighbors (1,4,9,15,18,26) must be colors 1,2.\n\nNext, process node 18 (degree 5). Assign color 1. Then neighbors of 18 (0,2,11,14 (already 0),30) can't be 1.\n\nSo node 0, connected to 18 (color 1), can't be 1. Also, node 0 is connected to 5, 15, 28, 31.\n\nLet's assign color 0 to node 14, color 1 to node 18. Next, process node 0 (degree 5). Its neighbors are 5, 18 (1), 28, 31, 15.\n\nSo node 0 can't be 1 (from 18) or the color of 5, 28, 31, 15. Let's see. The colors of these nodes are yet to be assigned. So for node 0, available colors are 0 and 2. But node 14 (color 0) is not connected to node 0. Wait, node 0 is connected to 5,18,28,31,15. So node 14 is not connected to 0. So node 0 can take color 0. Wait, but node 0's neighbors: 5,18,28,31,15. Node 18 is color 1. So node 0 can't be 1. If we assign color 0 to node 0, then its neighbors (5, 28,31,15) can't be 0. Let's try that. So node 0: color 0.\n\nWait, but node 0 is connected to 14? No, according to the adjacency list, node 0's neighbors are 5,18,28,31,15. Node 14 is connected to 0 via 14-15? Wait, looking back: the edges include 0-15. So node 0 is connected to 15. Node 15's neighbors are 23,0,14. So node 15 is connected to 14 (color 0). So node 15 can't be 0. Let's proceed.\n\nSo node 0: color 0. Then, its neighbors (5,18 (already 1), 28,31,15) can't be 0.\n\nSo next, node 5 is connected to 0 (0), so color of 5 must be 1 or 2. Let's assign color 1 to node 5. Then its neighbors (0 (0),7,22,29) can't be 1. So node 7,22,29 can't be 1.\n\nNode 7's neighbors are 5 (1) and 30. So node 7 can be 0 or 2.\n\nNext, node 15 is connected to 0 (0) and 14 (0). Wait, node 15's neighbors are 23,0,14. So 0 and 14 are both color 0. So node 15 can't be 0. So possible colors 1, 2. Let's pick color 1 for node 15. Then its neighbors (23,0 (0),14 (0)) can't be 1. So node 23 can't be 1.\n\nMoving on to node 31, which is connected to 1,27,9,0 (0). So node 31 can't be 0 (from 0's color). Let's assign color 1. Then node 1 (connected to 31) can't be 1. Also, node 31's neighbors: 1,27,9,0.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 14 (0),1,19,31 (1). So node 9 can't be 0 or 1. So must be color 2. Assign 2 to node 9.\n\nNow node 1 is connected to 31 (1),9 (2),14 (0),16. So node 1 can't be 0,1,2. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, node 1's current constraints: connected to 31 (color 1), so can't be 1. Connected to 9 (color 2), so can't be 2. Connected to 14 (color 0), so can't be 0. But all three colors are blocked. That's a conflict. So this indicates that my initial color assignments are leading to a conflict. So I need to backtrack.\n\nHmm, where did I go wrong? Let's see. Assigning color 0 to node 0, 1 to node 18, 0 to node 14. Then node 31 is connected to 0 (0), so can't be 0. Assigning color 1 to 31. Then node 1 (connected to 31 (1), 9 (2?), 14 (0)). Wait, but node 9 hasn't been assigned yet. Wait, when I assigned node 9, what's the order? Let me retrace steps.\n\nAfter assigning 14 (0), 18 (1), 0 (0), 5 (1), then 15 (1?), node 15's color: connected to 0 (0) and 14 (0), so can't be 0. Assigning 1. Then node 15's neighbor 23 can't be 1. Then node 31 is next. Assigning color 1 to 31. Then node 9, connected to 14 (0) and 31 (1). So node 9 can be 2. Assign 2. Then node 1 is connected to 14 (0), 9 (2), and 31 (1). So node 1 can't be 0,1,2. That's impossible. So this path is invalid. Therefore, the initial color choices must be adjusted.\n\nSo perhaps assigning node 0 to color 0 was a mistake. Let's try a different approach. Let's start over.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nNode 14 is high degree. Let's assign color 0 to 14.\n\nThen its neighbors: 1,4,9,15,18,26 must be 1 or 2.\n\nNext, node 18 (connected to 14 (0), 0,2,11,30). Assign color 1. Then neighbors can't be 1.\n\nNode 0 is connected to 18 (1). So node 0 can be 0 or 2.\n\nLet's assign node 0 to color 2. Then its neighbors:5,18 (1),28,31,15 can't be 2.\n\nSo node 5's color can be 0 or 1. Let's choose 0. But node 5 is connected to node 0 (color 2) and others. Assigning 0 to node 5. Then 5's neighbors (0 (2),7,22,29) can't be 0. So node 7 can be 1 or 2, etc.\n\nBut node 14 is color 0, and node 5's other neighbors are 7,22,29. Let's proceed.\n\nNode 5: color 0.\n\nThen node 7 is connected to 5 (0), so can't be 0. Assign color 1. Node 7's other neighbor is 30.\n\nNode 30: connected to 7 (1),10,32,18 (1). So node 30 can't be 1. Assign color 0 or 2.\n\nLet's pick color 0. Then node 30: color 0. Its neighbors (10,32,18 (1),7 (1)) can't be 0. So nodes 10 and 32 can be 1 or 2.\n\nNode 10: color 1. Node 32: color 1.\n\nProceeding to node 31. It's connected to 0 (2),1,9,27. So node 31 can't be 2. Possible colors 0 or 1. Assign color 1. Then node 31's neighbors (0,1,9,27) can't be 1.\n\nNode 1: connected to 14 (0),31 (1),9,16. So node 1 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2.\n\nNode 9: connected to 14 (0),1 (2),19,31 (1). So node 9 can't be 0,1,2. Oh wait, conflict. Again, problem here. So assigning 31 to 1 leads to node 9 being connected to 14 (0), 1 (2), 31 (1). So node 9's possible colors: 0 is forbidden (14), 1 is forbidden (31), 2 is forbidden (node 1 has 2). So no colors left. So this path is invalid.\n\nHmm. This is getting tricky. Maybe the issue is node 31's color. Let's try assigning node 31 to color 0. Then node 31 can't be 0 for its neighbors: 0 (2),1,9,27.\n\nSo node 31: color 0. Then node 0 is connected to 31 (0), but node 0's color is 2. No conflict. Then node 1 is connected to 31 (0), so can't be 0. Assign color 1 or 2.\n\nNode 1: let's assign color 1. Then node 9 is connected to 1 (1),14 (0), and 31 (0). So node 9 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2.\n\nNow node 9's color is 2. Its neighbors:14 (0),19,31 (0),1 (1). So node 19 is connected to 9 (2), and 21,23. Assign color 0 to node 19. Then node 19's neighbors 21 and 23 can't be 0.\n\nNode 21: connected to 19 (0), so color 1 or 2. Assign 1. Node 23 connected to 19 (0),15,25. So node 23 can be 1 or 2.\n\nBack to node 15: connected to 14 (0),0 (2),23. Since 14 is 0 and 0 is 2, node 15 can't be 0 or 2. So color 1.\n\nNode 15: color 1. Then node 23 is connected to 15 (1), so node 23 can't be 1. So if node 23 is assigned color 2, then its neighbor 25 is connected to 23 (2) and 20. Node 25: color 0 or 1.\n\nNode 20: connected to 6,29,25. Let's see node 6: connected to 20. Assign color 0. Node 20 can be color 1. Then 29 is connected to 20 (1),4,5 (0). So node 29 can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2. Node 4 is connected to 14 (0) and 29 (2). So node 4 can't be 0 or 2. Assign 1. Node 4's neighbors:14 (0),29 (2). So color 1 is okay.\n\nNode 5 is color 0. Its neighbors:0 (2),7 (1),22,29 (2). Node 22: connected to 5 (0). Assign color 1. Node 22's neighbor only 5, so color 1 is okay.\n\nNode 26: connected to 14 (0) and 16. Assign color 1 to node 26. Node 16 is connected to 26 (1) and 1 (1). So node 16 can't be 1. Assign color 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nNode 16: color 0. Connected to 1 (1) and 26 (1). So color 0 is okay.\n\nNode 2: connected to 18 (1). Assign color 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nNode 11: connected to 18 (1). Assign 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nNode 28: connected to 0 (2). Assign 0 or 1. Assign 0.\n\nNode 27: connected to 31 (0). Assign 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode 3: isolated. Assign any color. Let's assign 2.\n\nNode 8: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNode 12: isolated. Assign 1.\n\nNode 13: isolated. Assign 2.\n\nNode 17: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNode 24: isolated. Assign 1.\n\nNow, let's check all nodes:\n\n0: 2\n1:1\n2:0\n3:2\n4:1\n5:0\n6:0 (connected to 20 (1), okay)\n7:1 (connected to 5 (0),30 (0), okay)\n8:0\n9:2\n10:1\n11:0\n12:1\n13:2\n14:0\n15:1\n16:0\n17:0\n18:1\n19:0\n20:1\n21:1 (connected to 19 (0), okay)\n22:1 (connected to 5 (0), okay)\n23:2 (connected to 15 (1), 19 (0), 25 (which is connected to 20 (1)), needs to check. Node 23 is 2. Node 25 is connected to 20 (1) and 23 (2). So node 25 can be 0. Assign 0 to node 25.\n\nNode 25:0. Then node 20 (1) and 23 (2) are okay.\n\nNode 29:2 (connected to 4 (1),5 (0),20 (1)), okay.\n\nNode 30:0 (connected to 7 (1),18 (1),10 (1),32 (1)), okay.\n\nNode 31:0 (connected to 0 (2),1 (1),9 (2),27 (1)), okay.\n\nNode 32:1 (connected to 30 (0)), okay.\n\nCheck if any adjacent nodes have the same color:\n\n- 14 (0) and its neighbors:1 (1),4 (1),9 (2),15 (1),18 (1),26 (1) → all different. Good.\n- 0 (2) connected to 5 (0),18 (1),28 (0),31 (0),15 (1). Wait, node 0's color is 2. 5 is 0, 18 is 1, 28 is 0, 31 is 0, 15 is 1. All different. Okay.\n- 5 (0) connected to 0 (2),7 (1),22 (1),29 (2). All different.\n- 7 (1) connected to 5 (0),30 (0). Good.\n- 15 (1) connected to 14 (0),0 (2),23 (2). Wait, 23 is 2. 15 is 1.

All okay.\n- 25 (0) connected to 20 (1),23 (2). Good.\n- 20 (1) connected to 6 (0),29 (2),25 (0). Good.\n- 29 (2) connected to 4 (1),5 (0),20 (1). Good.\n- 4 (1) connected to 14 (0),29 (2).

Good.\n- 11 (0) connected to 18 (1). Good.\n- 28 (0) connected to 0 (2). Good.\n- 27 (1) connected to 31 (0). Good.\n- 3 (2) isolated. Okay.\n- 6 (0) connected to 20 (1). Good.\n- 8 (0), 10 (1), 12 (1), 13 (2), 17 (0), 24 (1), 32 (1) are all isolated or connected properly.\n\nNow check if all three colors are used. \n\nColors used:\n\n0: 14,5,6,8,16,19,28,30,17,2,11,25,3, etc. \n\n1:1,4,7,10,12,15,20,21,22,24,27, etc.\n\n2:0,9,23,29,31,13, etc.\n\nYes, all three colors are used. \n\nSo this coloring should work.

So 19's color can't be the same as these nodes.\n- 3 has multiple edges: 22, 40, 23, 30, 35. So 3's color must be different from all these connected nodes.\n\nHmm, this is a bit complex. Maybe a good approach is to start with nodes that have the highest degrees (most connected), as they are more constrained and their color choices will affect others.\n\nLooking at the nodes, let's try to find which ones have the most edges. For example, node 3 is connected to 22, 40, 23, 30, 35. That's five edges. Node 40 is connected to 3, 38, 7, 20, 35. Also five edges. Similarly, node 17 is connected to 7, 15, 4, 12, 30, 37. Wait, that's six edges. So node 17 has the highest degree here. Maybe start with node 17.\n\nAssign color 0 to node 17. Then all its neighbors (7, 15, 4, 12, 30, 37) can't be 0. Let's pick colors for them next. For example, node 7: since it's connected to 17 (0), maybe assign color 1. Then node 15 is connected to 17 (0) and 1. So node 15 can't be 0 or the same as node 1. Let's see, maybe node 1's color... but node 1 is connected to 15, 27, 29. Hmm, need to track that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a step-by-step approach, assigning colors as I go, checking for conflicts. Let's try building the color assignments step by step.\n\nStarting with node 17 (high degree). Assign color 0. Then its neighbors: 7,15,4,12,30,37 must be different. Let's pick color 1 for node 7. Then node 7's other neighbors: 17 (0), 40, 15. So 40 is connected to 7 (1), so 40 can't be 1. Let's assign 40 to color 2.\n\nNow, node 3 is connected to 40 (2) and 22,23,30,35. So 3's color can't be 2. Let's assign 0 to node 3. Then node 22 is connected to 3 (0) and 20 (connected to 22 and 40). So node 22 can't be 0. Let's assign 1 to node 22. Then node 20 is connected to 22 (1) and 40 (2). So node 20 can't be 1 or 2. So color 0.\n\nWait, node 20 is connected to 22 (1) and 40 (2). So possible color is 0. Assign 0 to node 20. But then node 40 is color 2, which is okay.\n\nMoving to node 15. Connected to 17 (0) and 1. Let's assign color 1 to node 15. Then node 1 is connected to 15 (1), so node 1 can't be 1. Let's assign 0 to node 1. Then node 1's other neighbors: 27 and 29 can't be 0. Assign colors 1 or 2 to them. For example, node 27: connected to 1 (0), so can be 1. Assign 1. Node 29 connected to 1 (0), so can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 1 for now.\n\nNode 4 is connected to 17 (0) and 19. Assign color 1 to node 4. Then node 19 is connected to 4 (1), 12, 23, 42. So node 19 can't be 1. Assign color 0. Then node 12 is connected to 19 (0) and 17 (0), so node 12 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Then node 8 is connected to 12 (1) and 16, 25. Assign color 0 to node 8. Then node 16 is connected to 8 (0) and 32. So node 16 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Node 32 is connected to 16 (1) and 21, 30. So node 32 can't be 1. Assign color 0. Node 30 is connected to 17 (0), 32 (0), and 3 (0). Oh wait, that's a problem. Because 30 is connected to 17 (0), 32 (0), and 3 (0). So node 30 can't be 0. Let's check the previous steps.\n\nWait, node 3 was assigned color 0. Node 30 is connected to 3 (0) and 17 (0). So node 30 must be a different color, like 1 or 2. Let's backtrack. Maybe when assigning node 30, I made a mistake.\n\nLet me redo that part. Node 17 is color 0. Node 3 is color 0. So node 30 is connected to 17 (0) and 3 (0), so node 30 can't be 0. Let's assign color 1 to node 30. Then node 32 is connected to 16 (1), 30 (1) → so node 32 can't be 1. Assign color 0. But node 32 was connected to 16 (1), so color 0 is okay. Then node 21 is connected to 32 (0) and 10, 34. Assign color 1 to node 21. Then node 10 is connected to 21 (1), so color 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nNode 34 is connected to 21 (1), 42, 35, and 9. So node 34's color can't be 1. Assign 0. Then node 42 is connected to 19 (0) and 34 (0), so 42 can't be 0. Assign 1. Node 35 is connected to 34 (0), 13, 38, 3 (0). So node 35 can't be 0. Assign 1. Then node 38 is connected to 35 (1) and 40 (2). So node 38 can't be 1 or 2. Assign 0. Wait, 40 is color 2. So 38 connected to 40 (2) and 35 (1), so 38 can be 0. Assign 0.\n\nNode 23 is connected to 19 (0), 37, 36. Node 19 is 0, so 23 can't be 0. Assign 1. Then node 37 is connected to 23 (1) and 17 (0). So 37 can't be 1 or 0. Assign 2. Node 36 is connected to 23 (1) and 6. Assign color 0 to node 36. Then node 6 is connected to 36 (0), so assign 1.\n\nNode 5 is connected to 26. Assign color 0. Node 26 is connected to 5 (0), 9, 24. Assign 1. Then node 9 is connected to 26 (1) and 34 (0). Assign 2. Node 24 is connected to 26 (1), assign 0.\n\nNode 0 is connected to 25 and 21 (1). Assign 0. Node 25 is connected to 0 (0) and 8 (0). So 25 can't be 0. Assign 1. But 8 is color 0, so okay.\n\nNode 13 is connected to 35 (1). Assign 0. Node 35 is 1, so okay.\n\nNode 11 connected to 18. Assign 0. Node 18 is connected to 11 (0), so assign 1.\n\nNode 14? Wait, the nodes go from 0 to 42. Let me check if I missed any. Wait, the list includes nodes 0-42, which is 43 nodes. Let's see which ones I haven't assigned yet.\n\nNodes assigned so far (maybe some missing):\n\n0: connected to 25 (1), 21 (1). So color 0.\n\n1: 0.\n\n2: Not mentioned in edges. So it's an isolated node. Assign color 0.\n\n3: 0.\n\n4: 1.\n\n5: 0.\n\n6: 1.\n\n7: 1.\n\n8: 0.\n\n9: 2.\n\n10: 0.\n\n11: 0.\n\n12: 1.\n\n13: 0.\n\n14: No edges. Assign 0.\n\n15: 1.\n\n16: 1.\n\n17: 0.\n\n18: 1.\n\n19: 0.\n\n20: 0.\n\n21: 1.\n\n22: 1.\n\n23: 1.\n\n24: 0.\n\n25: 1.\n\n26: 1.\n\n27: 1.\n\n28: Not in edges. Assign 0.\n\n29: 1.\n\n30: 1.\n\n31: Not in edges. Assign 0.\n\n32: 0.\n\n33: connected to 15 (1). Assign 0.\n\n34: 0.\n\n35: 1.\n\n36: 0.\n\n37: 2.\n\n38: 0.\n\n39: Not in edges. Assign 0.\n\n40: 2.\n\n41: Not in edges. Assign 0.\n\n42: 1.\n\nWait, let me check for any conflicts. For example, node 30 is color 1. Connected to 17 (0), 3 (0), 32 (0). So okay. Node 32 is 0, connected to 16 (1) and 21 (1). Okay. Node 37 is 2, connected to 17 (0) and 23 (1). Good.\n\nNode 40 is 2, connected to 3 (0), 7 (1), 20 (0), 38 (0), 35 (1). No conflict.\n\nNode 20 is 0, connected to 22 (1) and 40 (2). Correct.\n\nNode 35 is 1, connected to 34 (0), 38 (0), 3 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 42 is 1, connected to 19 (0) and 34 (0). Correct.\n\nIsolated nodes (like 2, 14, 28, 31, 39, 41) can be assigned color 0 since they have no edges. But wait, the problem states that the colors must be exactly 3, but if some nodes can be colored with 0, that's allowed as long as all three colors are used somewhere. However, the problem requires using exactly three colors, so the colors 0,1,2 must all be present. From the assignments made, colors 0,1,2 are used (e.g., 9 is 2, 37 is 2, 40 is 2). So that's okay.\n\nNow, check all edges:\n\nLet's pick some edges to verify:\n\n7-17: 1 and 0. Okay.\n\n15-33: 1 and 0. Okay.\n\n16-32:1 and 0. Okay.\n\n12-19:1 and 0. Okay.\n\n6-36:1 and 0. Okay.\n\n21-34:1 and 0. Okay.\n\n3-22:0 and 1. Okay.\n\n8-12:0 and 1. Okay.\n\n23-37:1 and 2. Okay.\n\n17-30:0 and 1. Okay.\n\n9-26:2 and 1. Okay.\n\n3-40:0 and 2. Okay.\n\n10-21:0 and 1. Okay.\n\n1-15:0 and 1. Okay.\n\n24-26:0 and 1. Okay.\n\n19-42:0 and 1. Okay.\n\n1-27:0 and 1. Okay.\n\n13-35:0 and 1. Okay.\n\n35-38:1 and 0. Okay.\n\n38-40:0 and 2. Okay.\n\n20-22:0 and 1. Okay.\n\n4-17:1 and 0. Okay.\n\n7-40:1 and 2. Okay.\n\n20-40:0 and 2. Okay.\n\n3-30:0 and 1. Okay.\n\n23-36:1 and 0. Okay.\n\n34-42:0 and 1. Okay.\n\n19-23:0 and 1. Okay.\n\n30-32:1 and 0. Okay.\n\n9-34:2 and 0. Okay.\n\n0-25:0 and 1. Okay.\n\n7-15:1 and 1. Wait, problem here! 7 is connected to 15. Wait, 7 was assigned color 1, 15 was assigned color 1. That's a conflict. Oh no! That's a mistake. So I need to fix that.\n\nThis is a critical error. Let's go back. Node 7 is connected to 17 (color 0), so node 7 can't be 0. But node 15 is connected to 17 (0), so node 15 also can't be 0. If node 7 and 15 are both connected to 17, which is 0, then they can't be 0. But earlier I assigned node 15 to color 1 and node 7 to color 1. But since 7 and 15 are connected (edge 7-15?), Wait, looking back at the edges list. Are 7 and 15 connected?\n\nLooking at the edges: the list includes \"7 - 15\" via \"7 - 15\" in the edges. Yes, because in the edges provided, there is \"7 - 15\". So node 7 and 15 are adjacent. Therefore, they must have different colors.\n\nEarlier, I assigned node 7 to 1 and node 15 to 1. That's invalid. Need to correct this.\n\nSo where did I go wrong? Let's retrace. Assign node 17 to 0. Then node 7 (connected to 17) can't be 0. Let's say node 7 is 1. Then node 15 (connected to 17) can't be 0. Also, node 7 and 15 are connected. So if node 7 is 1, then node 15 must be 2. Because 15 is connected to 17 (0) and 7 (1), so can't be 0 or 1. Assign node 15 to 2. Then node 15 is color 2. Then node 1 is connected to 15 (2), so node 1 can't be 2. So node 1 can be 0 or 1. Let's assign 0 to node 1 again. Then node 27 and 29 (connected to 1) can't be 0. Assign 1 to 27 and 2 to 29, perhaps.\n\nBut this change affects other parts. Let's adjust accordingly.\n\nStarting over with node 17 as 0. Then node 7 (connected to 17 and 15) can't be 0. Assign 1. Node 15 (connected to 17 and 7) can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2. So node 15 is color 2. Now, node 1 is connected to 15 (2) and 27, 29. So node 1 can't be 2. Assign 0. Then node 27 can be 1, and node 29 can be 1. But wait, node 1's edges are 1-15 and 1-27, 1-29. So nodes 27 and 29 can't be 0 (since node 1 is 0). Assign 1 or 2 to them. Let's assign node 27 as 1 and node 29 as 2.\n\nNow, node 15 is 2. Then node 33 (connected to 15) can't be 2. Assign 0.\n\nProceeding. Node 7 is 1. Node 40 is connected to 7 (1), so can't be 1. Assign 2. Then node 3 is connected to 40 (2), so node 3 can't be 2. Assign 0. Node 3 is also connected to 22, 23, 30, 35. So those nodes can't be 0.\n\nNode 22 is connected to 3 (0) and 20. Assign 1. Node 20 is connected to 22 (1) and 40 (2). Assign 0. Node 40 is 2, node 20 is 0: okay.\n\nNode 4 is connected to 17 (0), so can't be 0. Assign 1. Node 19 connected to 4 (1), so can't be 1. Assign 0. Node 12 connected to 19 (0) and 17 (0), so can't be 0. Assign 1. Node 8 connected to 12 (1) and 16, 25. Assign 0. Node 16 connected to 8 (0), can't be 0. Assign 1. Node 32 connected to 16 (1) and 21, 30. Assign 0. Node 30 connected to 17 (0) and 3 (0), so can't be 0. Assign 1. Node 30 is also connected to 32 (0), so 1 is okay.\n\nNode 21 connected to 32 (0) and 10, 34. Assign 1. Node 10 connected to 21 (1), assign 0. Node 34 connected to 21 (1) and 42, 35, 9. Assign 0. Node 42 connected to 19 (0) and 34 (0), can't be 0. Assign 1. Node 35 connected to 34 (0), 38, 3 (0), so can't be 0. Assign 1. Node 38 connected to 35 (1) and 40 (2), so can't be 1 or 2. Assign 0. But node 38's edges: 35 (1) and 40 (2). So 0 is allowed. Assign 0.\n\nNode 23 connected to 19 (0), 37, 36. Assign 1. Node 37 connected to 23 (1) and 17 (0), so can't be 1 or 0. Assign 2. Node 36 connected to 23 (1) and 6. Assign 0. Node 6 connected to 36 (0), assign 1.\n\nNode 5 connected to 26. Assign 0. Node 26 connected to 5 (0) and 9, 24. Assign 1. Node 9 connected to 26 (1) and 34 (0). Assign 2. Node 24 connected to 26 (1), assign 0.\n\nNode 0 connected to 25 and 21 (1). Assign 0. Node 25 connected to 0 (0) and 8 (0). Can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 13 connected to 35 (1). Assign 0. Node 35 is 1: okay.\n\nNode 11 connected to 18. Assign 0. Node 18 connected to 11 (0), assign 1.\n\nNow check node 7 (1) and 15 (2): okay.\n\nCheck node 15 (2) and 33 (0): okay.\n\nNode 7 (1) and 40 (2): okay.\n\nNode 3 (0) and 40 (2): okay.\n\nNode 30 (1) is connected to 17 (0), 3 (0), 32 (0): all okay.\n\nNow, let's check node 7 (1) and 15 (2): no conflict.\n\nOther edges: node 7 is also connected to 17 (0) and 40 (2). All okay.\n\nAnother edge to check: 15 (2) is connected to 1 (0) via 1-15. Node 1 is 0, node 15 is 2: okay.\n\nThen node 1's edges: 1-15 (2), 1-27 (1), 1-29 (2). Wait, node 1 is 0. So node 27 can be 1 (okay), node 29 can be 2 (okay). So node 29 is 2.\n\nNow, node 29 connected to 1 (0). Assign 2: okay.\n\nIsolated nodes: 2,14,28,31,39,41. Assign 0. Node 28: 0. Node 31: 0. Node 39:0. Node 41:0.\n\nNow, let's check other edges. For example, 23-37: 1 and 2. Okay. 34-35: 0 and 1. Okay. 8-25: 0 and 1. Okay. 35-38: 1 and 0. Okay.\n\nAnother edge: 3-23. Node 3 is 0, node 23 is 1: okay. 3-30: 0 and 1: okay. 3-35: 0 and 1: okay.\n\nNode 35 (1) connected to 3 (0), 34 (0), and 38 (0). All okay.\n\nNode 37 (2) connected to 17 (0) and 23 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 9 (2) connected to 26 (1) and 34 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 40 (2) connected to 3 (0),7 (1),20 (0),38 (0),35 (1). All okay.\n\nI think this should cover all edges without conflicts. Let's verify a few more edges:\n\nEdge 8-16: node 8 is 0, node 16 is 1: okay.\n\nEdge 21-32: node21 is 1, node32 is 0: okay.\n\nEdge 5-26: 0 and 1: okay.\n\nEdge 24-26: 0 and 1: okay.\n\nEdge 19-23: 0 and 1: okay.\n\nEdge 20-40: 0 and 2: okay.\n\nEdge 38-40: 0 and 2: okay.\n\nEdge 0-21: 0 and 1: okay.\n\nEdge 17-37: 0 and 2: okay.\n\nEdge 11-18: 0 and 1: okay.\n\nEdge 8-25: 0 and 1: okay.\n\nAll these seem okay.\n\nNow, the isolated nodes can be colored 0, which is allowed. Since the problem requires exactly 3 colors, but allows some nodes to share the same color as long as all three are used. We have colors 0,1,2 in use. So this should satisfy the conditions.\n\nNow, compiling the list of all 43 nodes with their colors as per this assignment:\n\n0: 0\n\n1: 0\n\n2: 0\n\n3: 0\n\n4: 1\n\n5: 0\n\n6: 1\n\n7: 1\n\n8: 0\n\n9: 2\n\n10: 0\n\n11: 0\n\n12: 1\n\n13: 0\n\n14: 0\n\n15: 2\n\n16: 1\n\n17: 0\n\n18: 1\n\n19: 0\n\n20: 0\n\n21: 1\n\n22: 1\n\n23: 1\n\n24: 0\n\n25: 1\n\n26: 1\n\n27: 1\n\n28: 0\n\n29: 2\n\n30: 1\n\n31: 0\n\n32: 0\n\n33: 0\n\n34: 0\n\n35: 1\n\n36: 0\n\n37: 2\n\n38: 0\n\n39: 0\n\n40: 2\n\n41: 0\n\n42: 1\n\nWait, let's confirm each node:\n\n0: color 0 (edges to 25 and 21: 25 is 1, 21 is 1. Okay).\n\n1: color 0 (edges to 15 (2), 27 (1), 29 (2). Okay).\n\n2: no edges, color 0.\n\n3: color 0 (edges to 22 (1),40 (2),23 (1),30 (1),35 (1). All different.

Okay).\n\n19: color 0 (edges to 12 (1),23 (1),42 (1),4 (1). Okay).\n\n20: color 0 (edges to 22 (1),40 (2). Okay).\n\n21: color 1 (edges to 32 (0),34 (0),10 (0). Okay).\n\n22: color 1 (edges to 3 (0),20 (0). Okay).\n\n23: color 1 (edges to 19 (0),37 (2),36 (0). Okay).\n\n24: color 0 (edge to 26 (1). Okay).\n\n25: color 1 (edges to 0 (0),8 (0). Okay).\n\n26: color 1 (edges to 5 (0),9 (2),24 (0). Okay).\n\n27: color 1 (edge to 1 (0). Okay).\n\n28: color 0 (no edges).\n\n29: color 2 (edge to 1 (0). Okay).\n\n30: color 1 (edges to 17 (0),3 (0),32 (0). Okay).\n\n31: color 0 (no edges).\n\n32: color 0 (edges to 16 (1),21 (1),30 (1). Okay).\n\n33: color 0 (edge to 15 (2). Okay).\n\n34: color 0 (edges to 21 (1),42 (1),35 (1),9 (2). Okay).\n\n35: color 1 (edges to 34 (0),38 (0),3 (0). Okay).\n\n36: color 0 (edges to 23 (1),6 (1). Okay).\n\n37: color 2 (edges to 23 (1),17 (0). Okay).\n\n38: color 0 (edges to 35 (1),40 (2). Okay).\n\n39: color 0 (no edges).\n\n40: color 2 (edges to 3 (0),7 (1),20 (0),38 (0),35 (1). Okay).\n\n41: color 0 (no edges).\n\n42: color 1 (edges to 19 (0),34 (0). Okay).\n\nAll nodes are accounted for, and all edges checked. No adjacent nodes share the same color.

Let's start by understanding the structure. The graph has 21 nodes (0 through 20) and a list of edges. Since it's a 2-coloring problem, I need to assign each node a color (0 or 1) such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. This is essentially checking if the graph is bipartite and then providing the coloring.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the edges to visualize the connections better. Let me write them down:\n\nEdges:\n6 - 15\n3 - 10\n5 - 7\n5 - 16\n8 - 9\n15 - 20\n5 - 15\n8 - 14\n0 - 10\n9 - 19\n10 - 14\n6 - 7\n7 - 12\n6 - 16\n16 - 18\n12 - 17\n3 - 17\n9 - 15\n11 - 18\nWait, wait, the user listed the edges as:\n\nEdges:\n6 - 15,\n3 - 10,\n5 - 7,\n5 - 16,\n8 - 9,\n6 - 8,\n15 - 20,\n5 - 15,\n8 - 14,\n0 - 10,\n9 - 19,\n10 - 14,\n6 - 7,\n7 - 12,\n6 - 16,\n16 - 18,\n12 - 17,\n3 - 17,\n9 - 15,\n11 - 18\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again. The user's list after splitting by commas would be:\n\n1. 6 - 15\n2. 3 - 10\n3. 5 - 7\n4. 5 - 16\n5. 8 - 9\n6. 6 - 8\n7. 15 - 20\n8. 5 - 15\n9. 8 - 14\n10. 0 - 10\n11. 9 - 19\n12. 10 - 14\n13. 6 - 7\n14. 7 - 12\n15. 6 - 16\n16. 16 - 18\n17. 12 - 17\n18. 3 - 17\n19. 9 - 15\n20. 11 - 18\n\nYes, 20 edges. Now, the plan is to model this as a bipartition problem. Let's start by building the adjacency list for each node. Then perform a BFS or DFS to assign colors, checking for conflicts.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph might not be connected, each connected component can be colored separately as long as each is bipartite. So first, I need to check if all connected components are bipartite. If any component isn't, then a 2-coloring isn't possible. But the problem states to provide a valid scheme, so I assume the graph is bipartite.\n\nLet me build the adjacency list. Let's create a list for each node.\n\nAdjacency list:\n\nNode 0: connected to 10 (from edge 0-10)\nNode 3: connected to 10, 17 (edges 3-10, 3-17)\nNode 5: connected to 7, 16, 15 (edges 5-7,5-16,5-15)\nNode 6: connected to 15,8,7,16 (edges 6-15,6-8,6-7,6-16)\nNode 7: connected to 5,6,12 (edges 5-7,6-7,7-12)\nNode 8: connected to 9,6,14 (edges 8-9,6-8,8-14)\nNode 9: connected to 8,19,15 (edges 8-9,9-19,9-15)\nNode 10: connected to 3,0,14 (edges 3-10,0-10,10-14)\nNode 11: connected to 18 (edge 11-18)\nNode 12: connected to 7,17 (edges7-12,12-17)\nNode 14: connected to 8,10 (edges8-14,10-14)\nNode 15: connected to 6,5,20,9 (edges6-15,5-15,15-20,9-15)\nNode 16: connected to5,6,18 (edges5-16,6-16,16-18)\nNode 17: connected to12,3 (edges12-17,3-17)\nNode 18: connected to16,11 (edges16-18,11-18)\nNode 19: connected to9 (edge9-19)\nNode 20: connected to15 (edge15-20)\nNodes not listed (1,2,4,13, etc.) don't have edges, so they can be colored arbitrarily as they don't conflict.\n\nWait, the nodes are 0-20. Let's check all nodes. The nodes with edges are 0,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. The nodes 1,2,4,13, etc. (Wait, 13? Let's see: nodes from 0 to 20. So nodes 1,2,4,13 are in the list. Let me check the edges again. The edges provided don't include these nodes. So nodes 1,2,4,13, for example, have no edges. So they can be colored either 0 or 1, as they don't connect to any other node. So in the coloring, those can be assigned any color, but since we need exactly two colors, they can be 0 or 1. But for the answer, we have to list all 21 nodes with their colors.\n\nSo first, handle all connected components. The main connected components would be:\n\n- The component involving 0,3,10,14, etc. Let's see:\n\nStarting from node 0: connected to 10. 10 is connected to 3 and 14. 3 is connected to 17, which is connected to 12. 12 is connected to7. 7 connected to 5,6. 5 connected to 15,16. 6 connected to 8,15,16, etc. Wait, perhaps this is a single large connected component? Let me see:\n\n0 is connected to 10. 10 connected to 3 and 14. 3 connected to 17. 17 connected to 12. 12 connected to7.7 connected to5 and6.5 connected to15,16. 15 connected to6,9,20.9 connected to8,19.8 connected to6,14.14 connected to8 and10. 16 connected to18.18 connected to11. So all these nodes are part of a big connected component. Then nodes 1,2,4,13 are isolated. So the graph has several connected components: the main big one, and then the isolated nodes.\n\nSo the main component is the one with nodes 0,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. Then the others are 1,2,4,13.\n\nSo for the main component, we need to assign colors such that adjacent nodes are different. Let's attempt to model this.\n\nLet's start by choosing a starting node. Let's pick node 0. Assign color 0. Then its neighbor 10 must be 1. 10's neighbors (3,14) must be 0. Then node3's neighbors (10,17). 10 is 1, so 3 is 0. Then 17 must be 1 (since connected to3, which is 0). 17's neighbor 12 must be 0. 12's neighbor7 must be 1. 7's neighbors:5,6,12. 12 is 0, so7 is 1. Then 5 is connected to7 (so 5 must be 0). 5's neighbors are7 (1),16,15. So 16 and15 must be 1. Then 16's neighbors are5 (0),6,18. So 6 must be 1 (since connected to5, which is 0). 6's neighbors are15 (1),8,7 (1),16 (1). Wait, 6 is connected to15, which is 1. So 6's color is 0 or 1? Wait, wait.\n\nHold on, let's track this step by step.\n\nStart:\n\n0 → color 0.\n\n0's neighbors:10 → color 1.\n\n10's neighbors:0 (0),3,14. So 3 and14 must be 0.\n\n3's neighbors:10 (1),17. So 3 is color 0. 17 must be 1.\n\n17's neighbors:12 (from edge 12-17) and3 (0). So 12 must be 0.\n\n12's neighbors:7 (from edge7-12) and17 (1). So 7 must be 1.\n\n7's neighbors:5 (edge5-7),6 (edge6-7),12 (0). So 5 and6 must be 0 (since 7 is 1).\n\n5's neighbors:7 (1),16,15. So 5 is 0. So 16 and15 must be 1.\n\n16's neighbors:5 (0),6,18. Since 16 is 1, 6 (if connected) must be 0. Wait, but 6 is connected to5 (0). So 6's color must be 1? Wait, wait.\n\nWait, 5 is connected to7 (1), so5 is 0. 5 is connected to16, so16 must be 1. Then 16 is connected to6. So 6 must be 0 (since 16 is 1). But 6 is connected to5 (0). So 6's color must be 1. Wait, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, let's re-examine. Let's backtrack.\n\nAt step where 7 is assigned color 1 (because connected to12 which is 0). Then 7's neighbors are 5,6, and12. So 5 and6 must be 0 (since 7 is 1).\n\n5 is 0, so its neighbors (7,16,15) must be 1. So 16 and15 are 1.\n\n16 is connected to5 (0) and6. Since 16 is 1, 6 must be 0. But 6 is connected to5 (0) and must be 0. But 6 is also connected to other nodes. For example, 6 is connected to15 (which is 1) via edge 6-15. So 6's color would be 0 (since 15 is 1). But also, 6 is connected to5 (0) so 6 must be 1. Wait, that's a problem. Contradiction here.\n\nWait, this suggests that the graph may not be bipartite. But the problem states that a valid coloring exists. So perhaps I made a mistake in the assignment. Let me check again.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's model the color assignments using BFS. Assign colors level by level, ensuring no conflicts.\n\nStart with node 0, color 0. Queue: [0].\n\nProcess node 0. Its neighbor 10 is uncolored. Assign color 1 to 10. Queue becomes [10].\n\nProcess node10. Neighbors: 0 (0), 3, and14. Assign color 0 to 3 and14. Now, check if these nodes are processed. Add 3 and14 to queue. Queue: [3,14].\n\nProcess node3. Neighbors:10 (1),17. Assign color 0 to 17. Wait, no. 3's color is 0. So 17 must be 1. Add 17 to queue. Queue becomes [14,17].\n\nProcess node14. Neighbors:8 (edge8-14) and10 (1). 14 is color 0. So 8 must be 1. Assign color 1 to8. Add8 to queue. Queue: [17,8].\n\nProcess node17. Neighbors:12 and3 (0). 17's color is 1. Assign 12 to 0. Add12 to queue. Queue becomes [8,12].\n\nProcess node8. Neighbors:9 (edge8-9),6 (edge6-8), and14 (0). 8's color is 1. So 9 and6 must be 0. Assign 0 to9 and6. Add9 and6 to queue. Queue: [12,9,6].\n\nProcess node12. Neighbors:7 (edge7-12) and17 (1). 12's color is 0. So assign7 to 1. Add7 to queue. Queue: [9,6,7].\n\nProcess node9. Neighbors:8 (1),19 (edge9-19),15 (edge9-15). 9's color is 0. Assign 1 to19 and15. Add19 and15 to queue. Queue: [6,7,19,15].\n\nProcess node6. Neighbors:15 (edge6-15),8 (1),7 (edge6-7),16 (edge6-16). 6's color is 0. So 15,7,16 must be 1. Assign 1 to15,7,16. But wait, 15 was just added to queue as color1, so that's okay. 7 is being processed next. Add7 (already in queue), 15,16. Wait, but 7 is already in queue. Assign 1 to7. Check if there's a conflict. Let's proceed.\n\nProcess node7. Neighbors:5 (edge5-7),6 (0),12 (0). 7's color is 1. So 5 must be 0. Assign 0 to5. Add5 to queue. Queue: [19,15,5,16].\n\nProcess node19. Neighbors:9 (0). 19's color is1. No other neighbors. So okay. Queue: [15,5,16].\n\nProcess node15. Neighbors:6 (0),5 (edge5-15),20 (edge15-20),9 (0). 15's color is1. So5 and20 must be 0. 5 is already being processed. Assign 0 to5. Add5 to queue again (but already there). 20 is assigned 0. Add20 to queue. Queue: [5,16,20].\n\nProcess node5. Neighbors:7 (1),16 (edge5-16),15 (1). 5's color is0. So 16 must be1. 16 is already assigned 1. So no conflict. Proceed.\n\nProcess node16. Neighbors:5 (0),6 (0),18 (edge16-18). 16's color is1. So 18 must be0. Assign0 to18. Add18 to queue. Queue: [20,18].\n\nProcess node20. Neighbors:15 (1). 20's color is0. No conflict. Add nothing. Queue: [18].\n\nProcess node18. Neighbors:16 (1),11 (edge11-18). 18's color is0. Assign1 to11. Add11 to queue. Queue: [11].\n\nProcess node11. Neighbors:18 (0). Assign1 to11. No conflict. Queue is empty.\n\nNow check all nodes in this component:\n\n0:0, 10:1, 3:0, 14:0, 17:1,8:1,12:0,9:0,6:0,7:1,19:1,15:1,5:0,16:1,20:0,18:0,11:1.\n\nNow check for conflicts in edges:\n\nCheck edge6-15:6 is0,15 is1. Okay.\n\n3-10:3 is0,10 is1. Good.\n\n5-7:5 is0,7 is1. Good.\n\n5-16:5 is0,16 is1. Good.\n\n8-9:8 is1,9 is0. Okay.\n\n6-8:6 is0,8 is1. Good.\n\n15-20:15 is1,20 is0. Good.\n\n5-15:5 is0,15 is1. Good.\n\n8-14:8 is1,14 is0. Good.\n\n0-10:0 is0,10 is1. Good.\n\n9-19:9 is0,19 is1. Good.\n\n10-14:10 is1,14 is0. Good.\n\n6-7:6 is0,7 is1. Good.\n\n7-12:7 is1,12 is0. Good.\n\n6-16:6 is0,16 is1. Good.\n\n16-18:16 is1,18 is0. Good.\n\n12-17:12 is0,17 is1. Good.\n\n3-17:3 is0,17 is1. Good.\n\n9-15:9 is0,15 is1. Good.\n\n11-18:11 is1,18 is0. Good.\n\nSo all edges in the connected component are satisfied. Now, the remaining nodes (1,2,4,13) have no edges. So they can be colored either 0 or1. Since the problem requires using exactly two colors, we can assign them any color. Let's assign them 0 to minimize the number of 1's, but it doesn't matter as long as they are 0 or1.\n\nSo nodes 1,2,4,13 can be assigned color 0.\n\nThus, the full coloring list would be:\n\n0:0,\n\n1:0,\n\n2:0,\n\n3:0,\n\n4:0,\n\n5:0,\n\n6:0,\n\n7:1,\n\n8:1,\n\n9:0,\n\n10:1,\n\n11:1,\n\n12:0,\n\n13:0,\n\n14:0,\n\n15:1,\n\n16:1,\n\n17:1,\n\n18:0,\n\n19:1,\n\n20:0.\n\nWait, but node7 is 1, node12 is0, node5 is0, etc. Let me verify all again. Also, node13 is isolated and assigned 0. Nodes 1,2,4 are 0. Yes.\n\nBut wait, I need to list all nodes from 0 to20. Let's make sure each node is covered.\n\nYes, 0 through 20:\n\n0 →0\n\n1 →0\n\n2 →0\n\n3 →0\n\n4 →0\n\n5 →0\n\n6 →0\n\n7 →1\n\n8 →1\n\n9 →0\n\n10 →1\n\n11 →1\n\n12 →0\n\n13 →0\n\n14 →0\n\n15 →1\n\n16 →1\n\n17 →1\n\n18 →0\n\n19 →1\n\n20 →0\n\nYes. All nodes are accounted for. Now, check if any adjacent nodes have the same color.\n\nIn the main component, we checked all edges. For the isolated nodes, no edges, so no conflicts.

Node 2 is connected to 9.\n\nThis seems like a fairly interconnected graph. Let's start by assigning colors step by step, making sure that each node's color doesn't conflict with its neighbors.\n\nMaybe I'll start with node 0. Let's assign color 0 to node 0. Then its neighbors (1 and 9) can't be color 0.\n\nNext, node 1. Since it's connected to 0 (color 0), it needs to be color 1 or 2. Let's pick color 1 for node 1. Now, node 1's neighbors (11,8,4,6,3) can't be color 1.\n\nNode 2 is connected to 9. Let's see, node 9's color isn't decided yet. But node 2 only connects to 9, so maybe we can assign it a color after 9. Let's hold on to node 2 for now.\n\nNode 3 is connected to 1 (color 1) and 8, 9. So node 3 can't be color 1. Let's pick color 0. Wait, but node 3 is connected to 8. If node 8's color is not determined yet, maybe assign color 0 to node 3. Then node 8 can't be 0. But let's check node 3's other connections. Node 3 is also connected to 9. So whatever color 9 gets, node 3's color needs to differ from 9's color as well.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to list each node and its adjacent nodes, then assign colors in order, making sure to check all adjacent colors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a greedy algorithm approach: go through the nodes in order, and for each node, choose the smallest available color that's not used by its already colored neighbors.\n\nBut since the graph might have a specific structure, let's try to find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the edges again, node 1 is highly connected. It's connected to nodes 0,3,4,6,8,11. So node 1 is a central hub. Assigning it color 0, but maybe that's not the best. Wait, earlier I thought assigning node 0 color 0, then node 1 can't be 0. Then node 1 could be color 1. But then all of node 1's neighbors (so 11,8,4,6,3) can't be color 1. Let's proceed.\n\nNode 0: color 0.\n\nNode 1: color 1.\n\nNow, node 3 is connected to 1 (color 1), so possible colors 0 or 2. Let's assign node 3 color 0.\n\nNode 8 is connected to 3 (color 0) and 1 (color 1) and 4. So node 8's color can't be 0 or 1. So it must be 2.\n\nWait, node 8's edges: 3-8, 1-8, 4-8. So node 8 is connected to 3 (color 0), 1 (color 1), and 4 (color to be determined). Wait, but 4 hasn't been colored yet. So when coloring node 8, we need to look at already colored neighbors. So if node 3 is color 0, node 1 is color 1, then node 8 can be color 2 (assuming node 4's color isn't 2 yet). Let's try that.\n\nSo node 8: color 2.\n\nNow node 4 is connected to 1 (color 1), 8 (color 2), and 9,5, etc. So node 4 can't be 1 or 2. So node 4 must be color 0.\n\nWait, let's check. Node 4's edges: 1-4, 4-9, 4-5, 4-8. So node 4 is connected to 1 (color 1), 8 (color 2), and 9 (unknown), 5 (unknown). So when coloring node 4, the already colored neighbors are 1 (1) and 8 (2). So node 4 can't be 1 or 2, so must be color 0.\n\nSo node 4: color 0.\n\nNow, node 9 is connected to 4 (color 0), 0 (color 0), 2,3,11. So node 9 can't be 0. Let's assign color 1. But wait, node 9 is connected to 0 (0), 4 (0), so 1 or 2. Let's pick color 1 for node 9.\n\nSo node 9: color 1.\n\nThen node 2 is connected only to 9 (color 1). So node 2 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. So node 2: 0.\n\nNow node 3 is color 0, connected to 8 (2), 9 (1). So that's okay.\n\nNext, node 5. Node 5 is connected to 4 (0) and 6. So node 5 can't be 0. Let's choose color 1. But wait, node 5 is also connected to 6. Let's see. If node 5 is 1, then node 6 can't be 1. Let's proceed.\n\nNode 5: color 1.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 5 (1), 7, and 1 (color 1). So node 6 can't be 1. So possible colors 0 or 2. Let's pick color 0. Wait, node 1 is color 1, so node 6 can't be 1. Assign color 0 to node 6. Then node 6's color is 0.\n\nNow node 7 is connected to 6 (0) and 10. So node 7 can't be 0. Let's assign color 1. Then node 7: 1.\n\nNode 10 is connected to 7 (1), so it can't be 1. Assign color 0. Node 10: 0.\n\nNode 11 is connected to 1 (color 1) and 9 (color 1). So node 11 can't be 1. So possible colors 0 or 2. Let's pick color 2. Node 11: 2.\n\nNow checking the remaining nodes:\n\nWait, did I miss any nodes? Let's list all nodes: 0-11.\n\nWe have:\n\n0:0\n\n1:1\n\n2:0\n\n3:0\n\n4:0\n\n5:1\n\n6:0\n\n7:1\n\n8:2\n\n9:1\n\n10:0\n\n11:2\n\nWait, let's check the edges for conflicts.\n\nCheck node 3 (color 0). It's connected to 8 (2), 9 (1), and 1 (1). No conflict.\n\nNode 8 (2) is connected to 3 (0), 1 (1), 4 (0). No problem.\n\nNode 4 (0) is connected to 1 (1), 8 (2), 9 (1), 5 (1). All okay.\n\nNode 9 (1) is connected to 4 (0), 0 (0), 2 (0), 3 (0), 11 (2). All adjacent nodes have different colors. Wait, node 9 is color 1, connected to node 0 (0) – okay, node 2 (0) – okay, node 3 (0) – okay, node 4 (0) – okay, node 11 (2) – okay. That's fine.\n\nNode 2 (0) is connected to 9 (1) – okay.\n\nNode 5 (1) connected to 4 (0) and 6 (0) – okay.\n\nNode 6 (0) connected to 5 (1), 7 (1), and 1 (1). Wait, node 6 is color 0, connected to 7 (1) – okay. Node 1 is color 1, so node 6 (0) is okay.\n\nNode 7 (1) connected to 6 (0) and 10 (0) – okay.\n\nNode 10 (0) connected to 7 (1) – okay.\n\nNode 11 (2) connected to 1 (1) and 9 (1) – okay.\n\nWhat about node 0 (0) connected to 1 (1) and 9 (1) – okay.\n\nNode 1 (1) connected to 0 (0), 3 (0), 4 (0), 6 (0), 8 (2), 11 (2) – all different from 1. That works.\n\nHmm, but wait, node 3 is color 0, which is connected to node 1 (1) and node 9 (1), so that's okay. Node 8 (2) is connected to node 3 (0), node 1 (1), and node 4 (0) – all okay.\n\nWait, node 8 is color 2. It's connected to node 4 (color 0), so that's okay.\n\nAnother thing to check: node 4-5: 4 (0) and 5 (1) – okay. 4-8: 0 and 2 – okay. 4-9: 0 and 1 – okay. 4-5 is okay.\n\nWhat about node 5-6: 1 and 0 – okay.\n\nNode 6-7: 0 and 1 – okay. Node 6-1: 0 and 1 – okay.\n\nNode 7-10: 1 and 0 – okay.\n\nNode 0-9: 0 and 1 – okay.\n\nNode 9-11: 1 and 2 – okay.\n\nNode 1-11: 1 and 2 – okay.\n\nNode 3-9: 0 and 1 – okay.\n\nNode 1-8: 1 and 2 – okay.\n\nNode 4-8: 0 and 2 – okay.\n\nNode 2-9: 0 and 1 – okay.\n\nNode 1-3: 1 and 0 – okay.\n\nNode 1-4: 1 and 0 – okay.\n\nNode 1-6: 1 and 0 – okay.\n\nNode 3-8: 0 and 2 – okay.\n\nEverything seems okay. So this coloring uses colors 0,1,2. Let me double-check if all edges are covered and no adjacent nodes have the same color. I think this works. All assigned colors are within 0-2, and exactly 3 colors are used. So the answer should be the list of nodes with their colors as assigned.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 0], [3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 1], [6, 0], [7, 1], [8, 2], [9, 1], [10, 0], [11, 2]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

The graph has 19 nodes (0 to 18) and a bunch of edges. We need to color them using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2). The challenge is to assign colors such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. Let's start by understanding the structure of the graph through the given edges.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges to see which nodes are connected. Let me parse the edges:\n\nEdges:\n6 - 18\n3 - 4\n3 - 10\n8 - 9\n0 - 8\n10 - 15\n3 - 6\n14 - 18\n5 - 18\n0 - 1\n0 - 13\n2 - 13\n15 - 16\n6 - 13\n6 - 10\n7 - 18\n3 - 5\n1 - 7\n2 - 6\n2 - 12\n\nHmm. Let's see if there are any cliques or nodes with high degrees that might be tricky. Looking at the edges, node 6 is connected to several nodes: 18, 3, 10, 13, 2. Similarly, node 18 is connected to 6, 14, 5, 7. Node 3 is connected to 4,10,6,5. So these nodes might require careful coloring since they have multiple connections.\n\nSince the graph requires 3 colors, I need to ensure that each node is assigned a color different from all its adjacent nodes. Let's start by handling the nodes with the highest degrees first, as they might limit the color choices.\n\nLet's list the degree of each node (approximate):\n\nNode 6: edges with 18,3,10,13,2,10? Wait, edges listed as 6-18, 3-6, 2-6, 6-13, 6-10. So node 6 has 5 edges. High degree.\n\nNode 18: edges with 6,14,5,7. So 4 edges.\n\nNode 3: edges with 4,10,6,5. 4 edges.\n\nNode 2: edges with 13,6,12. So 3 edges.\n\nNode 10: edges with 3,15,6. So 3 edges.\n\nNode 0: edges with 8,1,13. 3 edges.\n\nOthers have lower degrees. So starting with node 6. Let's assign color 0 to node 6. Then all its neighbors (18,3,2,13,10) can't be 0.\n\nNext, node 3. Its neighbors are 4,10,6,5. Since 6 is color 0, node 3 can't be 0. Let's assign color 1 to node 3. Then neighbors 4,10,5 must not be 1.\n\nNode 18 connected to 6 (color 0). So 18 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign color 1 to node 18. Then its neighbors 14,5,7 can't be 1.\n\nNow node 10: connected to 3 (color 1) and 6 (color 0). So 10 can't be 0 or 1, so must be color 2.\n\nNode 15 is connected to 10 (color 2) and 16. Assign color 0 to 15. Then 16 can't be 0.\n\nNode 5: connected to 3 (color 1) and 18 (color 1). So 5 can't be 1. Assign color 0. Then node 5's neighbors (3 and 18) are okay.\n\nNode 7: connected to 18 (color 1) and 1. Assign 0 to node 7. Then node 1 can't be 0.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 0 and 7 (color 0). So node 1 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Then node 0's neighbors (1,8,13) need to be considered.\n\nNode 0: connected to 1 (color 1), 8, and 13. So node 0 can't be 1. Let's assign color 0. Wait, but node 0's neighbor 8 would then need to not be 0. Wait, node 0 is connected to 8. If I assign color 0 to node 0, then node 8 must be a different color. Let's see. Assign node 0 to color 0. Then node 8 can't be 0. Let's choose color 1 for node 8. Then node 9, connected to 8 (color 1), so 9 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Let's pick 2.\n\nNode 13: connected to 0 (color 0), 2, 6 (color 0). So node 13 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Then node 2, connected to 13 (color 1) and 6 (color 0). So node 2 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2.\n\nNode 2 is connected to 13 (1), 6 (0), and 12. So node 2 is color 2. Then node 12 can't be 2. Assign 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode 4 is connected to 3 (color 1). So assign 0 or 2. Let's choose 0.\n\nNode 14: connected to 18 (color 1). Assign 0 or 2. Let's pick 2.\n\nNode 16: connected to 15 (color 0). Assign 1 or 2. Let's assign 1.\n\nNode 9: connected to 8 (color 1). Assign 0 or 2. Earlier thought was 2. Assign 2.\n\nNode 17: Wait, the nodes are 0-18. The list includes 0 to 18, which is 19 nodes. Let me check if any nodes are not mentioned. The nodes in the problem are 0,1,2,...,18. So all 19 nodes. Wait, looking back at the edges, some nodes might not have any edges. For example, node 17: looking at the edges list, I don't see any edges involving node 17. So node 17 is an isolated node. So its color can be 0, 1, or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nLet me check all nodes now:\n\n0: color 0\n1: color 1 (connected to 0 and 7 (0))\n2: color 2 (connected to 13 (1), 6 (0), 12 (0))\n3: color 1 (connected to 4 (0), 10 (2), 6 (0), 5 (0))\n4: color 0 (connected to 3 (1))\n5: color 0 (connected to 3 (1), 18 (1))\n6: color 0 (connected to 18 (1), 3 (1), 2 (2), 13 (1), 10 (2))\n7: color 0 (connected to 18 (1), 1 (1))\n8: color 1 (connected to 0 (0), 9 (2))\n9: color 2 (connected to 8 (1))\n10: color 2 (connected to 3 (1), 6 (0), 15 (0))\n11: No edges. So color 0.\n12: color 0 (connected to 2 (2))\n13: color 1 (connected to 0 (0), 2 (2), 6 (0))\n14: color 2 (connected to 18 (1))\n15: color 0 (connected to 10 (2), 16 (1))\n16: color 1 (connected to 15 (0))\n17: color 0 (isolated)\n18: color 1 (connected to 6 (0), 14 (2), 5 (0),7 (0))\n\nWait, node 11: I need to check if any edges involve 11. Looking at the edges list again, the edges provided don't include node 11. So node 11 is isolated. So its color can be 0,1,2. Assign 0.\n\nLet me verify all connections to ensure no conflicts:\n\nCheck node 0 (color 0): neighbors 1 (1), 8 (1), 13 (1). All different. Okay.\n\nNode 1 (1): neighbors 0 (0), 7 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 2 (2): neighbors 13 (1), 6 (0), 12 (0). All different. Good.\n\nNode 3 (1): neighbors 4 (0),10 (2),6 (0),5 (0). All different. Yes.\n\nNode 4 (0): neighbor 3 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 5 (0): neighbors 3 (1), 18 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 6 (0): neighbors 18 (1),3 (1),2 (2),13 (1),10 (2). All different. Correct.\n\nNode 7 (0): neighbors 18 (1),1 (1).

So 10 is 2, which is different from 0. Correct.\n\nNode 11 (0): no neighbors. Okay.\n\nNode 12 (0): neighbor 2 (2). Different. Okay.\n\nNode 13 (1): neighbors 0 (0),2 (2),6 (0). All different.

Let's see if there's a structure here. Maybe grouping nodes by their connections. Let's try to map out which nodes are connected to whom.\n\nStarting with node 15. It's connected to 6,4,7,15-16,17, and 16. Wait, edges involving 15 are: 6-15,4-15,7-15,15-16,15-17. So node 15 has a lot of edges. That's going to be a central point. Nodes connected to 15 are 6,4,7,16,17. So those nodes need different colors than 15.\n\nSimilarly, node 7 is connected to 1, 4, 15, 16. So node 7 is connected to 1,4,15,16. So all those nodes can't share 7's color.\n\nThis might get complicated. Maybe I should start assigning colors step by step, using a greedy approach. Let's pick a node and assign color 0, then check its neighbors and assign different colors, and so on. Let's try to order the nodes by their degrees to handle the most connected ones first.\n\nCalculating degrees for each node:\n\n0: edges to 14,4 → degree 2\n\n1: edges to 5,7,10 → degree 3\n\n2: edges to 13,3,6 → degree 3\n\n3: edges to 2,11 → degree 2\n\n4: edges to 15,0,7 → degree 3\n\n5: edges to 16,1,17 → degree 3\n\n6: edges to 15,2 → degree 2\n\n7: edges to 16,15,4,1 → degree 4\n\n8: No edges? Wait, the list of edges given doesn't include node 8. Let me check again. The nodes are from 0-19. The edges listed don't have node 8 connected to any other. So node 8 is isolated. So its color can be 0,1, or 2. Similarly, check for others. Let's verify all nodes are in the edge list.\n\nLooking at the edges: 6-15,4-15,14-19,5-16,0-14,10-12,7-16,15-17,9-13,0-4,1-5,2-13,15-16,7-15,4-7,3-11,5-17,2-3,1-7,2-6,1-10,11-18.\n\nNodes present in edges: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Wait, nodes 8 is missing. So node 8 is not connected to anyone. So it can be colored with any of the three colors. Same for node 8, but also, maybe node 12? Let's check node 12: connected to 10 (from edge 10-12). So 12 has degree 1. Similarly, node 19 is connected to 14. Node 18 is connected to 11. Node 17 is connected to 15 and 5. So yes, node 8 is the only isolated node. So its color is easy.\n\nSo let's handle node 8 first. Assign color 0. Then proceed.\n\nBut perhaps starting with the highest degree nodes. Node 7 has degree 4 (connected to 16,15,4,1). Let's start with node 7. Assign color 0. Then its neighbors (1,4,15,16) can't be 0.\n\nSo node 1's color must be 1,2. Let's say we assign color 1 to node 1. Then node 1's neighbors (5,7,10) must not be color 0 (for 7) and for node 1's color is 1. So node 5,7 (already 0), 10 must not be 1. So for node 5, since it's connected to 1 (color 1), node 5 can be 0 or 2. But node 5 is also connected to 16 and 17.\n\nWait, maybe this approach is getting too tangled. Maybe using a backtracking approach would help, but since this is a problem to be solved manually, perhaps a step-by-step assignment with careful checking.\n\nAlternative approach: Create a list of nodes sorted by the number of edges (degree) descending. Then assign colors in that order, picking the first available color not used by neighbors.\n\nThe nodes with highest degrees:\n\nNode 7: degree 4\n\nNode 15: connected to 6,4,7,16,17 → degree 5?\n\nWait, edges involving 15: 6-15,4-15,7-15,15-16,15-17. So yes, node 15 has 5 edges.\n\nThen node 15 has the highest degree (5), then node 7 (4), then nodes like 1,4,5, etc.\n\nSo perhaps process node 15 first.\n\nAssign color 0 to node 15. Then its neighbors 6,4,7,16,17 cannot be 0.\n\nNext, node 7 (degree 4). Its neighbors are 1,4,15,16. Since 15 is 0, node 7 can't be 0. The available colors are 1 and 2. Let's assign 1 to node 7. Then its neighbors (1,4,15,16) can't be 1.\n\nNode 15 is already 0. So node 1,4,16 can't be 1. So for node 4: neighbors are 15 (0), 0,7 (1). So node 4 can't be 0 or 1. So color 2.\n\nWait, node 4 is connected to 15 (0), 0 (unknown yet), and 7 (1). So if we assign color 2 to node 4, then node 0's color must not be 2 (since 0 is connected to 4). But node 0 is also connected to 14.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\n1. Assign color 0 to node 15.\n\n2. Assign color 1 to node 7.\n\n3. Assign color 2 to node 4 (since connected to 15 (0) and 7 (1)).\n\n4. Next, node 16 (connected to 5,7 (1), 15 (0)). So node 16's neighbors are 5,7,15. 7 is 1, 15 is 0. So node 16 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2.\n\n5. Node 5: connected to 1,16 (2), 17. So 16 is 2. Node 5 can't be 2. Also connected to node 1 (unknown) and 17 (unknown). Let's assign color 0 to node 5. Wait, but node 5 is connected to node 1. So if node 1's color is 0, then node 5 can't be 0. But we don't know node 1's color yet. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe better to list the nodes in order of degree and process them.\n\nLet me make a list of nodes sorted by their degrees in descending order:\n\nNode 15: degree 5\n\nNode 7: 4\n\nNodes 1,4,5,16: degree 3 each?\n\nWait, node 15: 5 edges (6,4,7,16,17)\n\nNode 7: 4 edges (1,4,15,16)\n\nNode 1: connected to 5,7,10 → degree 3\n\nNode 4: connected to 15,0,7 → degree 3\n\nNode 5: connected to 1,16,17 → degree 3\n\nNode 16: connected to 5,7,15, etc. Wait, edges for node 16: 5-16,7-16,15-16. So three edges. So degree 3.\n\nSo the order would be 15,7, then 1,4,5,16, and others.\n\nSo processing order: 15,7,1,4,5,16, then others.\n\nLet's proceed.\n\nStep 1: Assign color 0 to node 15.\n\nNow, neighbors of 15: 6,4,7,16,17 cannot be 0.\n\nStep 2: Assign color 1 to node 7 (since connected to 15 (0)).\n\nNeighbors of 7: 1,4,15 (0),16. So 1,4,16 can't be 1.\n\nStep 3: Process node 1. Its neighbors are 5,7 (1),10. So cannot be 1. Available colors: 0 and 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nBut wait, node 1's neighbor 7 is color 1, so 1 can be 0 or 2. Let's choose 0 for node 1.\n\nNow, node 1's neighbors (5,7,10) must not be 0. So 5 can't be 0,7 is 1, 10 can't be 0.\n\nStep 4: Process node 4. Neighbors are 15 (0), 0,7 (1). So 4 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2.\n\nNow, node 4 is 2. Its neighbors: 15 (0), 0 (unknown),7 (1). So node 0 connected to 4 (2) and 14. So when we process node 0, it can't be 2.\n\nStep 5: Process node 5. Neighbors are 1 (0),16 (unknown),17. So node 5 can't be 0. Available colors:1 and 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nBut wait, node 5 is connected to 1 (0), so it can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 1. Then node 16 (connected to 5) can't be 1.\n\nBut node 16's neighbors are 5,7 (1),15 (0). So node 16 can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\nSo node 16 is 2.\n\nStep 6: Process node 16. Already assigned to 2 as above.\n\nNow, proceed to other nodes.\n\nNext is node 6, connected to 15 (0) and 2. So node 6 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nThen node 6 is 1.\n\nNext, node 17, connected to 15 (0) and 5 (1). So node 17 can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\nNode 17 is 2.\n\nNow, node 0 is connected to 14 and 4 (2). So node 0 can't be 2. Assign the lowest available color. Possible colors: 0 or 1. Let's check if 0 is possible. Neighbor 4 is 2, which is okay. Also, node 0 is connected to 14. If we assign 0 to node 0, then node 14 can't be 0. Let's assign 1 to node 0.\n\nSo node 0 is 1. Then node 14 (connected to 0 (1) and 19) must not be 1.\n\nThen node 14 can be 0 or 2.\n\nProceeding to node 14. Assign 0. Then node 19 is connected to 14 (0) so can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 19: 1.\n\nNow, node 10 is connected to 1 (0) and 12. So node 10 can't be 0. Assign 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Then node 12 is connected to 10 (1), so can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\nNode 12: 0.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 13. Assign 0. Then node 13 is connected to 9 (0) and 2. So node 13 can't be 0. Assign 1. But node 2 is connected to 13 (1) and 3,6 (1). Wait, node 2's connections: 13 (1), 3 (unknown), 6 (1). So node 2 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2.\n\nBut node 2 is connected to 6 (1), so it can't be 1. Let's assign 0 to node 2. Then node 13, connected to 2 (0), 9 (0), which is a conflict. Because node 13 is connected to 9 (0) and 2 (0), so node 13 can't be 0. So when we assigned node 13 to 1, that's correct. Wait, node 13 is connected to 9 (0) and 2 (0). So node 13's color must not be 0. So when node 9 is 0, node 13 can be 1 or 2. Assign 1. Then node 2, connected to 13 (1), can't be 1. So node 2 can be 0 or 2. But node 2 is also connected to 3 and 6 (1). Wait, node 2's edges: 2-13, 2-3, 2-6. So node 2 is connected to 13 (1), 3, 6 (1). So node 2 can't be 1. Assign 0. Then node 3, connected to 2 (0) and 11. So node 3 can't be 0. Assign 1 or 2.\n\nAssign 1 to node 3. Then node 11, connected to 3 (1) and 18. Assign 0 to node 11. Node 18, connected to 11 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNow, node 8 is isolated. Assign 0.\n\nLet's check all nodes:\n\n0:1\n\n1:0\n\n2:0\n\n3:1\n\n4:2\n\n5:1\n\n6:1\n\n7:1\n\n8:0\n\n9:0\n\n10:1\n\n11:0\n\n12:0\n\n13:1\n\n14:0\n\n15:0\n\n16:2\n\n17:2\n\n18:1\n\n19:1\n\nWait, but let's check conflicts.\n\nCheck node 7 (color 1). Its neighbors are 1 (0),4 (2),15 (0),16 (2). All okay.\n\nCheck node 15 (0). Neighbors 6 (1),4 (2),7 (1),16 (2),17 (2). All different. Good.\n\nCheck node 1 (0). Neighbors 5 (1),7 (1),10 (1). Wait, node 1 is 0. 5 is 1, which is okay. 7 is 1. Wait, node 1 is connected to 7. But node 7's color is 1. Oh! That's a problem. Because node 1 (0) is connected to node 7 (1). Wait, that's okay. Wait, node 1's color is 0, node 7's color is 1. So that's okay. No conflict there. My mistake earlier. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, node 7's color is 1. So node 1's color is 0, which is allowed. So that's fine.\n\nCheck node 5 (color 1). Neighbors are 1 (0),16 (2),17 (2). Correct.\n\nCheck node 4 (2). Neighbors 15 (0),0 (1),7 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 0 (1) connected to 14 (0) and 4 (2). Okay.\n\nNode 2 (0) connected to 13 (1), 3 (1), 6 (1). All okay.\n\nNode 3 (1) connected to 2 (0) and 11 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 6 (1) connected to 15 (0) and 2 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 10 (1) connected to 1 (0) and 12 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 12 (0) connected to 10 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 9 (0) connected to 13 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 13 (1) connected to 9 (0) and 2 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 14 (0) connected to 0 (1) and 19 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 19 (1) connected to 14 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 11 (0) connected to 3 (1) and 18 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 18 (1) connected to 11 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 8 (0) is isolated. Correct.\n\nNode 16 (2) connected to 5 (1),7 (1),15 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 17 (2) connected to 15 (0) and 5 (1). Correct.\n\nSo this seems to work. Let's verify again each node's edges.\n\nAnother check for node 5: color 1. Neighbors: 1 (0),16 (2),17 (2). All okay.\n\nNode 7: color 1. Neighbors:1 (0),4 (2),15 (0),16 (2). All okay.\n\nNode 10: color 1. Neighbors:1 (0),12 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 3: color 1. Neighbors:2 (0),11 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 2: color 0. Neighbors:13 (1),3 (1),6 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 6: color 1. Neighbors:15 (0),2 (0). Correct.\n\nLooks like all edges are satisfied. Now, let's count the colors used. Are exactly 3 colors used?\n\nColors used: 0,1,2. Yes. All three colors are used.\n\nSo the final assignment is:\n\n[[0,1],[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[4,2],[5,1],[6,1],[7,1],[8,0],[9,0],[10,1],[11,0],[12,0],[13,1],[14,0],[15,0],[16,2],[17,2],[18,1],[19,1]]\n\n\nAnswer: [[0,1],[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[4,2],[5,1],[6,1],[7,1],[8,0],[9,0],[10,1],[11,0],[12,0],[13,1],[14,0],[15,0],[16,2],[17,2],[18,1],[19,1]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

So, the task is to color 18 nodes using exactly 2 colors (0 and 1) such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. Let's start by understanding the edges provided.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges to see the connections:\n\n- 9 - 16\n- 5 - 12\n- 9 - 13\n- 5 - 8\n- 10 - 17\n- 5 - 17\n- 8 - 10\n- 3 - 16\n- 8 - 16\n- 1 - 13\n- 5 - 6\n- 1 - 10\n- 4 - 8\n- 0 - 8\n- 0 - 14\n- 2 - 11\n- 3 - 5\n- 7 - 8\n\nHmm. Let's try to visualize or group these nodes. Maybe start by looking for nodes with high degrees. Let's see:\n\nNode 8 is connected to 5, 10, 16, 4, 0, 7. That's six edges. So node 8 has a high degree. Let's note that. Node 5 is connected to 12, 8, 17, 6, 3. Five edges. Node 10 is connected to 17, 8, 1. Node 16 is connected to 9, 3, 8. Node 17 is connected to 10, 5. Node 13 is connected to 9,1. Node 1 is connected to 13,10. Node 0 is connected to 8,14. Node 3 is connected to 16,5. \n\nSince this is a bipartite graph check (if it can be colored with 2 colors), the graph must be bipartite. Let's assume it is, as the question asks for a 2-coloring.\n\nIn bipartite graphs, the nodes can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two nodes within the same set are adjacent. So the idea is to assign color 0 to one set and 1 to the other.\n\nLet's start assigning colors. Let's pick node 8 first. Let's assign color 0. Then all its neighbors (5,10,16,4,0,7) must be color 1.\n\nWait, but node 5 is connected to node 3. If node 5 is color 1, then node 3 must be 0. But node 3 is connected to 16. If 16 is color 1 (since 8 is 0), then node 3 must be 0. That's okay. Let's proceed.\n\nAssigning:\n\n8 → 0\n\nNeighbors of 8 (5,10,16,4,0,7) → 1.\n\nSo:\n\n5 →1\n\n10 →1\n\n16 →1\n\n4 →1\n\n0 →1\n\n7 →1\n\nNow, let's look at node 5's neighbors (12,17,6,3). They must be color 0 since 5 is 1.\n\nSo:\n\n12 →0\n\n17 →0\n\n6 →0\n\n3 →0\n\nWait, but node 3 is connected to 16 (which is 1). So 3 being 0 is okay. Then 16 is 1, which is adjacent to 3 (0), that's fine.\n\nNext, node 10's neighbors are 17 and 1. Wait, node 10 is color 1. So 17 is color 0 (already done), and node 1 must be color 0.\n\nSo node 1 →0.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 13 and 10. 10 is 1, so 1's color is 0, so 13 must be 1. So 13 →1. Then 9 is connected to 13 and 16. 13 is 1, so 9 must be 0. 16 is 1, so 9 is 0. That's okay. So 9 →0.\n\nThen 9's neighbors: 16 (1) and 13 (1). Wait, 9 is 0. That's okay.\n\nNode 0 is color 1, connected to 8 (0) and 14. So 14 must be 0. 14 →0.\n\nNode 3 is 0, connected to 5 (1) and 16 (1) — okay.\n\nNode 17 is 0, connected to 10 (1) and 5 (1) — correct.\n\nNow, node 7 is 1, connected to 8 (0) — okay.\n\nNode 4 is 1, connected to 8 (0) — okay.\n\nNode 6 is 0, connected to 5 (1) — correct.\n\nNode 12 is 0, connected to 5 (1) — correct.\n\nWhat about nodes 2 and 11? The edge is 2-11. They are not connected to any others. So they can be colored as long as they are different from each other. Let's assign 2→0, 11→1. Or 2→1, 11→0. Since nodes 2 and 11 are only connected to each other. Let's check if either is connected elsewhere. The edges list doesn't show any other connections for 2 or 11. So let's pick 2 as 0, 11 as 1.\n\nWait, but the color options are 0 and 1. So for 2 and 11: since they are connected, they need different colors. Let's assign 2→0, 11→1.\n\nNow, check remaining nodes. Let's see:\n\nNode 14 is 0 (connected to 0 which is 1 — correct).\n\nWhat about node 15? Wait, the nodes listed are 0-17, so 18 nodes (0 to 17 inclusive). Wait, the nodes are 0,1,...17. The problem states:\n\nNodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. So 18 nodes. Oh, right. So nodes 0 through 17. So the nodes include 15. Wait, but in the edges given, is node 15 connected to anyone? Looking at the edges, I don't see node 15 mentioned. So node 15 is an isolated node. Since the problem allows using exactly 2 colors, but an isolated node can be colored either 0 or 1. So for node 15, since it's not connected to anyone, we can assign either color. Let's assign it 0.\n\nSimilarly, node 2 and 11 are handled. Are there any other nodes not yet assigned?\n\nLet me list all nodes:\n\n0 →1\n\n1 →0\n\n2 →0\n\n3 →0\n\n4 →1\n\n5 →1\n\n6 →0\n\n7 →1\n\n8 →0\n\n9 →0\n\n10 →1\n\n11 →1\n\n12 →0\n\n13 →1\n\n14 →0\n\n15 →0\n\n16 →1\n\n17 →0\n\nWait, node 17 was assigned 0. But earlier, node 10 is 1, connected to 17 (0) — correct. Node 5 is 1 connected to 17 (0) — correct.\n\nWait, but node 17's edges are 10-17 and 5-17. So 17 is connected to 10 (1) and 5 (1). So 17 must be color 0. Correct.\n\nNow, check for node 3. Node 3 is connected to 5 (1) and 16 (1). So node 3 is 0, which is correct.\n\nNode 9 is 0, connected to 16 (1) and 13 (1) — okay.\n\nNode 13 is 1, connected to 9 (0) and 1 (0) — correct.\n\nNode 1 is 0, connected to 13 (1) and 10 (1) — correct.\n\nNode 2 is 0, connected to 11 (1) — correct.\n\nNode 11 is 1, connected to 2 (0) — correct.\n\nNode 15 is 0 and has no edges — okay.\n\nNow, check all nodes. Let's list all 18 nodes and ensure each has a color.\n\nYes:\n\n0:1\n\n1:0\n\n2:0\n\n3:0\n\n4:1\n\n5:1\n\n6:0\n\n7:1\n\n8:0\n\n9:0\n\n10:1\n\n11:1\n\n12:0\n\n13:1\n\n14:0\n\n15:0\n\n16:1\n\n17:0\n\nNow, check that all edges have different colors:\n\nEdge 9-16: 9 is 0, 16 is 1 — okay.\n\n5-12: 5=1, 12=0 — okay.\n\n9-13:9=0,13=1 — okay.\n\n5-8:5=1,8=0 — okay.\n\n10-17:10=1,17=0 — correct.\n\n5-17:5=1,17=0 — correct.\n\n8-10:8=0,10=1 — correct.\n\n3-16:3=0,16=1 — correct.\n\n8-16:8=0,16=1 — correct.\n\n1-13:1=0,13=1 — correct.\n\n5-6:5=1,6=0 — correct.\n\n1-10:1=0,10=1 — correct.\n\n4-8:4=1,8=0 — correct.\n\n0-8:0=1,8=0 — correct.\n\n0-14:0=1,14=0 — correct.\n\n2-11:2=0,11=1 — correct.\n\n3-5:3=0,5=1 — correct.\n\n7-8:7=1,8=0 — correct.\n\nAll edges are properly colored. Also, isolated nodes (15) are assigned a color (0).

So I need to assign colors to 28 nodes (0 through 27) using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2) such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. Let's start by understanding the edges given.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges to see which nodes are connected. Let me parse each edge pair:\n\n- 16-20\n- 12-13\n- 0-2\n- 14-25\n- 5-25\n- 1-6\n- 0-14\n- 5-22\n- 11-23\n- 10-21\n- 13-23\n- 6-8\n- 7-19\n- 15-26\n- 5-21\n- 4-23\n- 11-16\n- 0-13\n- 10-17\n- 15-18\n- 6-16\n- 15-22\n- 6-19\n- 18-24\n- 20-21\n- 21-26\n- 2-3\n- 9-18\n- 2-18\n- 11-18\n- 11-24\n- 1-25\n- 11-27\n\nHmm, that's a lot of edges. Maybe it's better to create an adjacency list for each node to see their neighbors. Let's build that:\n\nNode 0 is connected to 2, 14, 13.\nNode 1 connected to 6, 25.\nNode 2 connected to 0, 3, 18.\nNode 3 connected to 2.\nNode 4 connected to 23.\nNode 5 connected to 25, 22, 21.\nNode 6 connected to 1, 8, 16, 19.\nNode 7 connected to 19.\nNode 8 connected to 6.\nNode 9 connected to 18.\nNode 10 connected to 21, 17.\nNode 11 connected to 23, 16, 18, 24, 27.\nNode 12 connected to 13.\nNode 13 connected to 12, 23, 0.\nNode 14 connected to 25, 0.\nNode 15 connected to 26, 18, 22.\nNode 16 connected to 20, 11, 6, 11 (duplicate?), wait, no. Wait the edges list has 11-16 and 6-16, so 16's neighbors are 20, 11, 6.\nNode 17 connected to 10.\nNode 18 connected to 15, 9, 2, 11, 24, 15 (maybe duplicate?), checking edges: edges are 15-18, 2-18, 11-18, 9-18, 18-24. So neighbors for 18 are 15, 9, 2, 11, 24.\nWait, wait 15-18, 9-18, 2-18, 11-18, 18-24. So node 18 is connected to 15, 9, 2, 11, 24. Also, the edge 18-24 connects to 24. So node 24 is connected to 18 and 11 (from 11-24 edge). So node 24's neighbors are 18 and 11.\n\nContinuing:\n\nNode 19 connected to 6,7.\nNode 20 connected to 16,21.\nNode 21 connected to 10,5,20,26.\nNode 22 connected to 5,15.\nNode 23 connected to 11,13,4.\nNode 24 connected to 18,11.\nNode 25 connected to 14,5,1.\nNode 26 connected to 15,21.\nNode 27 connected to 11.\n\nOkay, now that I have the adjacency list, I need to assign colors. Let's start by choosing a node and assigning a color, then ensuring its neighbors have different colors.\n\nSince the graph might have a structure that allows for 3-coloring, but I need to check if it's possible. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nStarting with node 0. Let's assign color 0. Then its neighbors (2,14,13) can't be 0.\n\nNode 2: neighbor of 0 (color 0), so possible colors 1 or 2. Let's assign 1. Then node 2's neighbors (0,3,18) can't be 1. Node 0 is already 0, so 3 and 18 can't be 1. Let's handle node 3 next. Node 3 is only connected to node 2 (color 1). So node 3 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 0. Then node 3's color is 0.\n\nNow node 18, connected to node 2 (color 1). So node 18 can't be 1. Let's come back to node 18.\n\nNext, node 14, connected to 0 (color 0). Assign color 1. Then node 14's neighbors (25 and 0). 25 is connected to 14 (color 1), 5, and 1.\n\nSo node 25 can't be 1. Let's assign node 25 a color. It's connected to 14 (1), 5, and 1 (from node 1). Wait, node 25's neighbors are 14,5,1. Wait node 1 is connected to 6 and 25. So node 1's color: let's see. Node 1's neighbors are 6 and 25. Let's handle node 1 later.\n\nBack to node 25: neighbors are 14 (1), 5, and 1 (assuming node 1 is another neighbor). So node 25 needs a color different from 1 (from 14) and whatever node 1 and 5 have. Let's assign node 25 to color 2. Then node 5 (connected to 25, 22, 21). So node 5 can't be 2 (since 25 is 2). Assign node 5 to color 0. Then node 22 (connected to 5) can't be 0. Node 22 is also connected to 15. Let's handle node 15. Node 15 is connected to 26, 18, and 22. Assigning color to node 15: let's see. Suppose node 15 is color 0. Then node 26 (connected to 15) can't be 0. Node 26's neighbors are 15 and 21. If 15 is 0, 26 can be 1. Then node 21 (connected to 26) can't be 1. Node 21's neighbors are 10,5,20,26. 5 is 0, so 21 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 21 to 2. Then 20 (connected to 21) can't be 2. Node 20 is connected to 16 and 21. Assign node 20 to color 1. Then node 16 (connected to 20 and 11,6) can't be 1. Assign node 16 to color 0. Then node 11 (connected to 16, which is 0) can't be 0. Node 11's neighbors are 16 (0), 23, 18,24,27. So node 11's color can be 1 or 2. Let's pick color 1. Then node 23 (connected to 11) can't be 1. Node 23's neighbors are 11 (1),13,4. Assign node 23 to 0. Then node 13 (connected to 23 (0),12,0). Node 0 is color 0, so node 13 can't be 0. Assign node 13 to 1. Then node 12 (connected to 13 (1)) can be 0 or 2. Assign 0. Now, node 4 (connected to 23 (0)) can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's track step by step:\n\n1. Node 0: color 0.\nNeighbors: 2,14,13.\n\n2. Node 2: color 1.\nNeighbors: 0,3,18.\n\n3. Node 3: color 0 (only connected to 2 (1)).\n\n4. Node 14: color 1 (connected to 0 (0)).\n   Node 14's neighbors: 25 and 0. So node 25 can't be 1.\n\n5. Node 25: color 2 (since connected to 14 (1) and possibly others).\n   Node 25's neighbors: 14 (1), 5, 1 (node 1).\n\n6. Node 5: connected to 25 (2), so must be 0 or 1. Let's assign 0.\n\n   Node 5's neighbors: 25 (2), 22, 21. So 22 and 21 can't be 0.\n\n7. Node 22: connected to 5 (0), so color can be 1 or 2. Node 22 is also connected to 15. Let's assign 1.\n\n8. Node 15: connected to 22 (1), 26, 18. So 15 can't be 1. Let's assign 0.\n\n   Now, node 26 (connected to 15 (0)) can be 1 or 2. Node 26's other neighbor is 21.\n\n9. Assign node 26: color 1. So node 21 (connected to 26 (1)) can't be 1. Also, node 21 is connected to 5 (0), 10, and 20.\n\n   Assign node 21: color 2.\n\n10. Node 10 connected to 21 (2) and 17. Assign color 0 (since 21 is 2). Node 10's color 0.\n\n    Node 17 connected to 10 (0) → color 1.\n\n11. Node 20 connected to 16 and 21 (2). So node 20 can't be 2. Assign color 0 or 1. Let's pick 1. Then node 16 connected to 20 (1) can't be 1. Assign node 16 color 0.\n\n    Node 16's neighbors: 20 (1), 11,6.\n\n    Node 6 connected to 16 (0), 1,8,19. Assign color: can't be 0. Let's pick 1. But node 1 is connected to 6. So node 1 can't be 1 if 6 is 1. Let's see.\n\n    Node 6's color is 1. So node 1 (connected to 6) can't be 1. Assign node 1 color 0. Then node 25 is connected to 1 (0). Wait, node 25's color is 2, which is okay (since 1 is 0, 25 is 2, so no conflict). But node 1's other neighbor is 6 (1), which is okay.\n\n12. Node 8 connected to 6 (1). Assign color 0.\n\n13. Node 19 connected to 6 (1) and 7. Assign color 0. Then node 7 connected to 19 (0) → color 1.\n\n14. Back to node 11: connected to 16 (0), so color can't be 0. Assign color 1. Then node 23 (connected to 11 (1)) can't be 1. Assign node 23 to 0.\n\n    Node 13 connected to 23 (0) and 12,0 (0). So node 13 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Then node 12 connected to 13 (1) → color 0.\n\n    Node 4 connected to 23 (0) → color 1.\n\n15. Now, node 18: connected to 15 (0), 9, 2 (1), 11 (1), 24. So node 18's color can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\n    Node 18's neighbors:\n\n    - 15 (0) → okay.\n    - 9: must not be 2.\n    - 2 (1) → okay.\n    - 11 (1) → okay.\n    - 24: connected to 18 (2) → 24 can't be 2.\n\n    Assign node 9 (connected to 18 (2)) → color 0 or 1. Let's assign 0.\n\n    Node 24 connected to 18 (2) and 11 (1). So node 24 can't be 2 or 1. Assign 0.\n\n    Check node 11's color is 1, node 24 is 0 → okay.\n\n16. Node 27 connected to 11 (1) → color can be 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nLet's check remaining nodes:\n\n- Node 3 is 0 (connected to 2 (1) → okay).\n- Node 4 is 1 (connected to 23 (0) → okay).\n- Node 7 is 1 (connected to 19 (0) → okay).\n- Node 9 is 0 (connected to 18 (2) → okay).\n- Node 10 is 0 (connected to 21 (2) and 17 (1) → okay).\n- Node 12 is 0 (connected to 13 (1) → okay).\n- Node 17 is 1 (connected to 10 (0) → okay).\n- Node 19 is 0 (connected to 6 (1) and 7 (1) → okay).\n- Node 20 is 1 (connected to 16 (0) and 21 (2) → okay).\n- Node 22 is 1 (connected to 5 (0) and 15 (0) → wait, node 15 is 0. So node 22's color is 1, connected to 15 (0) → okay. Also 5 is 0, which is okay.\n- Node 24 is 0 (connected to 18 (2) and 11 (1) → okay).\n- Node 27 is 0 (connected to 11 (1) → okay).\n\nWait, node 22 is color 1. Node 15 is 0, connected to 22 (1) → okay. Node 5 is 0, connected to 22 (1) → okay.\n\nNow let's check all edges for conflicts:\n\nCheck node 2 (color 1) connected to 0 (0), 3 (0), 18 (2). All okay.\n\nCheck node 18 (color 2) connected to 15 (0), 9 (0), 2 (1), 11 (1), 24 (0). All okay.\n\nCheck node 21 (2) connected to 10 (0), 5 (0), 20 (1), 26 (1). All okay.\n\nCheck node 11 (1) connected to 16 (0), 23 (0), 18 (2), 24 (0), 27 (0). All okay.\n\nCheck node 5 (0) connected to 25 (2), 22 (1), 21 (2). All okay.\n\nCheck node 25 (2) connected to 14 (1), 5 (0), 1 (0). All okay.\n\nCheck node 6 (1) connected to 1 (0), 8 (0), 16 (0), 19 (0). All okay.\n\nCheck node 15 (0) connected to 26 (1), 18 (2), 22 (1). All okay.\n\nCheck node 24 (0) connected to 18 (2) and 11 (1) → okay.\n\nCheck node 23 (0) connected to 11 (1), 13 (1), 4 (1) → okay.\n\nCheck node 13 (1) connected to 12 (0), 23 (0), 0 (0) → okay.\n\nCheck node 16 (0) connected to 20 (1), 11 (1), 6 (1) → okay.\n\nCheck node 20 (1) connected to 16 (0) and 21 (2) → okay.\n\nCheck node 26 (1) connected to 15 (0) and 21 (2) → okay.\n\nCheck node 17 (1) connected to 10 (0) → okay.\n\nCheck node 7 (1) connected to 19 (0) → okay.\n\nCheck node 19 (0) connected to 6 (1) and 7 (1) → okay.\n\nCheck node 9 (0) connected to 18 (2) → okay.\n\nCheck node 27 (0) connected to 11 (1) → okay.\n\nCheck node 4 (1) connected to 23 (0) → okay.\n\nCheck node 12 (0) connected to 13 (1) → okay.\n\nCheck node 3 (0) connected to 2 (1) → okay.\n\nCheck node 8 (0) connected to 6 (1) → okay.\n\nCheck node 1 (0) connected to 6 (1) and 25 (2) → okay.\n\nCheck node 10 (0) connected to 21 (2) and 17 (1) → okay.\n\nCheck node 22 (1) connected to 5 (0) and 15 (0) → okay.\n\nCheck node 14 (1) connected to 0 (0) and 25 (2) → okay.\n\nThat seems to cover all edges. All adjacent nodes have different colors.

So, the task is to assign colors to each node using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2) such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. The graph has 34 nodes (0 to 33) and a list of edges provided. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the graph by looking at the edges. Let's list out the edges again to see the connections:\n\n15-21, 16-20, 6-15, 16-32, 7-29, 20-26, 5-10, 14-25, 8-12, 3-28, 17-18, 2-5, 10-12, 5-28, 5-31, 2-23, 1-33, 20-28, 14-15, 23-30, 4-23, 11-13, 13-19, 19-20, 20-21, 20-30, 4-19, 5-8, 4-25, 10-16, 9-18, 19-28, 11-27, 10-31. Wait, the user provided the edges in a certain order. Let me make sure I have all the edges correctly.\n\nLooking at the given edges:\n\n- 15 - 21\n- 16 - 20\n- 6 - 15\n- 16 - 32\n- 7 - 29\n- 20 - 26\n- 5 - 10\n- 14 - 25\n- 8 - 12\n- 3 - 28\n- 17 - 18\n- 2 - 5\n- 10 - 12\n- 5 - 28\n- 5 - 31\n- 2 - 23\n- 1 - 33\n- 20 - 28\n- 14 - 15\n- 23 - 30\n- 4 - 23\n- 11 - 13\n- 19 - 20\n- 30 - 32\n- 2 - 13\n- 0 - 28\n- 9 - 31\n- 13 - 19\n- 20 - 21\n- 12 - 17\n- 20 - 30\n- 4 - 19\n- 5 - 8\n- 4 - 25\n- 10 - 16\n- 9 - 18\n- 19 - 28\n- 11 - 27\n- 10 - 31\n\nHmm, that's a lot. Let me try to visualize some parts. For example, node 20 is connected to many nodes: 16, 26, 28, 19, 21, 30, etc. Similarly, node 5 is connected to 10, 2, 28, 31, 8, etc. So these nodes might form a more complex structure, possibly part of a larger component.\n\nSince the graph is to be colored with 3 colors, I need to approach this systematically. One method is to use backtracking or a greedy algorithm with some heuristics. But since this is a problem-solving scenario, perhaps I can look for nodes with high degrees and start from there to assign colors in a way that minimizes conflicts.\n\nLet me list out the degree of each node. That might help. For example:\n\nNode 20: connected to 16, 26, 28, 19, 21, 30, 20-26, 20-28, 19-20, 20-21, 20-30 (Wait, in the edge list, 16-20, 20-26, 20-28, 19-20, 20-21, 20-30, 20-28 again? Let me count correctly.\n\nLooking at edges involving node 20:\n\n- 16-20\n- 20-26\n- 20-28\n- 19-20\n- 20-21\n- 20-30\n- 20-28 (but that's the same as 20-28 earlier, so maybe a duplicate? No, perhaps the user listed some edges multiple times by mistake. Wait, the original problem's edge list as provided is:\n\nEdges (format: NodeA - NodeB):\n15 - 21, 16 - 20, 6 - 15, 16 - 32, 7 - 29, 20 - 26, 5 - 10, 14 - 25, 8 - 12, 3 - 28, 17 - 18, 2 - 5, 10 - 12, 5 - 28, 5 - 31, 2 - 23, 1 - 33, 20 - 28, 14 - 15, 23 - 30, 4 - 23, 11 - 13, 19 - 20, 30 - 32, 2 - 13, 0 - 28, 9 - 31, 13 - 19, 20 - 21, 12 - 17, 20 - 30, 4 - 19, 5 - 8, 4 - 25, 10 - 16, 9 - 18, 19 - 28, 11 - 27, 10 - 31.\n\nSo node 20 is connected to: 16, 26, 28, 19, 21, 30. That's 6 edges. So degree 6.\n\nSimilarly, node 5 is connected to 10, 2, 28, 31, 8, and also via edges 5-10 (twice?), no, in the edge list, 5-10, 2-5, 5-28, 5-31, 5-8. So node 5's connections: 10, 2, 28, 31, 8. Degree 5.\n\nOther nodes: for example, node 19 is connected to 20, 13, 4, 28. Let's check edges: 19-20, 13-19, 4-19, 19-28. So degree 4.\n\nSo high-degree nodes are 20 (degree 6), 5 (5), maybe others like 10 (connected to 5, 12, 16, 31), which would be degree 4. So perhaps start with node 20.\n\nThe idea is to assign colors in an order where higher-degree nodes come first, so that we can avoid conflicts later. Alternatively, use a greedy algorithm where we pick the node with the highest degree, assign the smallest possible color, then proceed.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a 3-coloring problem, perhaps the graph is 3-colorable, and we can proceed by building the color assignments step by step.\n\nLet me try to model the adjacency list first. Let's build an adjacency list for each node.\n\nAdjacency list:\n\n0: connected to 28 (from edge 0-28)\n\n1: connected to 33 (edge 1-33)\n\n2: connected to 5, 23, 13 (edges 2-5, 2-23, 2-13)\n\n3: connected to 28 (edge 3-28)\n\n4: connected to 23, 19, 25 (edges 4-23, 4-19, 4-25)\n\n5: connected to 10, 2, 28, 31, 8 (edges 5-10, 2-5, 5-28, 5-31, 5-8)\n\n6: connected to 15 (edge 6-15)\n\n7: connected to 29 (edge 7-29)\n\n8: connected to 12, 5 (edges 8-12, 5-8)\n\n9: connected to 31, 18 (edges 9-31, 9-18)\n\n10: connected to 5, 12, 16, 31 (edges 5-10, 10-12, 10-16, 10-31)\n\n11: connected to 13, 27 (edges 11-13, 11-27)\n\n12: connected to 8, 10, 17 (edges 8-12, 10-12, 12-17)\n\n13: connected to 2, 11, 19 (edges 2-13, 11-13, 13-19)\n\n14: connected to 25, 15 (edges 14-25, 14-15)\n\n15: connected to 21, 6, 14 (edges 15-21, 6-15, 14-15)\n\n16: connected to 20, 32, 10 (edges 16-20, 16-32, 10-16)\n\n17: connected to 18, 12 (edges 17-18, 12-17)\n\n18: connected to 17, 9 (edges 17-18, 9-18)\n\n19: connected to 20, 13, 4, 28 (edges 19-20, 13-19, 4-19, 19-28)\n\n20: connected to 16, 26, 28, 21, 30 (edges 16-20, 20-26, 20-28, 20-21, 20-30, 19-20) Wait, looking back, edges for 20:\n\n- 16-20\n- 20-26\n- 20-28\n- 19-20 (from 19-20 edge)\n- 20-21\n- 20-30 (from 20-30 edge)\nSo that's 6 edges. Wait, the edges listed for 20 are: 16-20, 20-26, 20-28, 19-20, 20-21, 20-30. So indeed, node 20 has 6 neighbors: 16,26,28,19,21,30.\n\n21: connected to 15, 20 (edges 15-21, 20-21)\n\n22: Wait, the nodes listed are from 0 to 33, but looking at the edges, is node 22 present? Let me check the edges again. The edges provided are:\n\n15 - 21, 16 - 20, 6 - 15, 16 - 32, 7 - 29, 20 - 26, 5 - 10, 14 - 25, 8 - 12, 3 - 28, 17 - 18, 2 - 5, 10 - 12, 5 - 28, 5 - 31, 2 - 23, 1 - 33, 20 - 28, 14 - 15, 23 - 30, 4 - 23, 11 - 13, 19 - 20, 30 - 32, 2 - 13, 0 - 28, 9 - 31, 13 - 19, 20 - 21, 12 - 17, 20 - 30, 4 - 19, 5 - 8, 4 - 25, 10 - 16, 9 - 18, 19 - 28, 11 - 27, 10 - 31.\n\nLooking through all the edges, none of them involve node 22. So node 22 is isolated. That's important. So node 22 has no edges. Therefore, it can be colored with any color, but since we need to use exactly 3 colors, but the problem says \"exactly 3 colors\", but I think it's allowed to use all three colors, even if some are not used. Wait, the problem states: \"using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2)\". So the coloring must use all three colors? Or just that the colors available are 0,1,2, and exactly three are to be used, perhaps. The wording is a bit ambiguous. But since the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\", perhaps the solution must use all three colors. However, in some cases, a graph might be colorable with fewer, but the problem requires using exactly 3. However, in this case, maybe the graph is 3-chromatic, so it requires 3 colors. But since there are 34 nodes, some of which are isolated (like node 22), perhaps those can be colored with any color. But the answer can have some colors not used, as long as the total used is exactly 3. Wait, the instruction says: \"using exactly the number of colors specified\", which is 3. So the colors must be 0,1,2, and the coloring uses those three (but perhaps not all of them). For example, if the graph is bipartite (2-colorable), but the problem asks for 3 colors, then you have to use the third color even if not needed. But perhaps the graph here requires 3 colors. For example, if there's a cycle of odd length, that requires 3 colors.\n\nBut regardless, our task is to assign colors from 0,1,2, ensuring no adjacent nodes share the same color. Now, node 22 is isolated, so its color can be 0, 1, or 2. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, starting the coloring process. Let's list all the nodes and assign colors step by step.\n\nOne approach is to order the nodes by descending degree and assign colors in that order, choosing the smallest available color not used by adjacent nodes. This is the greedy algorithm with the degree heuristic, which can help reduce conflicts.\n\nSo let's list the nodes in order of their degree (descending). Let's compute the degrees:\n\nNode 20: degree 6 (edges with 16,26,28,19,21,30)\n\nNode 5: degree 5 (edges with 10,2,28,31,8)\n\nNode 10: degree 4 (edges with 5,12,16,31)\n\nNode 19: degree 4 (edges with 20,13,4,28)\n\nNode 28: degree 5 (edges with 3,5,0,20,19,5-28, 20-28, 19-28, 0-28, 3-28). Wait, let's check edges involving 28:\n\nEdges:\n\n3-28, 5-28, 0-28, 20-28, 19-28.\n\nSo node 28 is connected to 3,5,0,20,19. That's 5 edges. So degree 5.\n\nSo node 28 has degree 5.\n\nSo nodes with highest degrees: 20 (6), 28 (5), 5 (5), 10 (4), 19 (4), 16 (edges: 20, 32, 10 → degree 3), 30 (edges: 23,20,32 → 3?), wait, let's compute all:\n\n0: connected to 28 → degree 1\n\n1: connected to 33 → degree 1\n\n2: connected to 5,23,13 → degree 3\n\n3: connected to 28 → degree 1\n\n4: connected to 23,19,25 → degree 3\n\n5: connected to 10,2,28,31,8 → degree 5\n\n6: connected to 15 → degree 1\n\n7: connected to 29 → degree 1\n\n8: connected to 12,5 → degree 2\n\n9: connected to 31,18 → degree 2\n\n10: connected to 5,12,16,31 → degree 4\n\n11: connected to 13,27 → degree 2\n\n12: connected to 8,10,17 → degree 3\n\n13: connected to 2,11,19 → degree 3\n\n14: connected to 25,15 → degree 2\n\n15: connected to 21,6,14 → degree 3\n\n16: connected to 20,32,10 → degree 3\n\n17: connected to 18,12 → degree 2\n\n18: connected to 17,9 → degree 2\n\n19: connected to 20,13,4,28 → degree 4\n\n20: connected to 16,26,28,19,21,30 → degree 6\n\n21: connected to 15,20 → degree 2\n\n22: no edges → degree 0\n\n23: connected to 2,4,30 → degree 3 (edges 2-23,4-23,23-30)\n\n24: Wait, the nodes are from 0 to 33. The edges provided don't include node 24. So node 24 is isolated. Wait, no. The original problem lists nodes 0-33, but in the edges, there's no mention of node 24. So node 24 is also isolated.\n\nSimilarly, node 22 and 24 are isolated. Also, node 22 is in the nodes list. Let me check the nodes again:\n\nThe problem says: Nodes: 0,1,2,... up to 33. So all nodes 0-33 are present. So nodes 22 and 24, etc., are part of the graph but not connected to any edges.\n\nSo their degrees are zero. So for the ordering, let's proceed.\n\nHighest degree nodes:\n\n20 (6), 28 (5), 5 (5), 19 (4), 10 (4), 2 (3), 4 (3), 12 (3), 13 (3), 16 (3), 23 (3), 30 (edges: 23-30, 20-30, 30-32 → degree 3), 25 (edges: 14-25,4-25 → degree 2), etc.\n\nSo ordering the nodes from highest to lowest degree, the first few are 20, 28,5,19,10, etc.\n\nNow, let's start coloring.\n\nFirst, node 20: highest degree. Assign color 0.\n\nThen, node 28: connected to 20 (color 0), so cannot use 0. Assign color 1.\n\nThen node 5: connected to 28 (color 1) and others. But since we're processing in order, node 5's adjacent nodes may not have been colored yet. So, what's the adjacent nodes of 5? 10,2,28,31,8.\n\nOf those, 28 is colored with 1, others (10,2,31,8) may not yet be colored. So available colors for 5 are 0 and 2. Assign the smallest available, which is 0. But wait, check adjacent nodes: 28 has color 1, others are not colored yet. So color 0 is okay. Assign 0 to node 5.\n\nNext, node 19: connected to 20 (color 0), 13, 4, 28 (color 1). So adjacent colors are 0 and 1. Available color: 2. Assign 2 to node 19.\n\nNode 10: connected to 5 (color 0), 12, 16, 31. Adjacent nodes: 5 (0). Assign color 1.\n\nProceeding to node 28 is already done.\n\nThen node 2: connected to 5 (0),23,13. So adjacent node 5 has color 0. Assign the smallest available, which is 1. Assign 1 to node 2.\n\nNext, node 4: connected to 23,19 (color 2), 25. Adjacent to 19 (2). Available colors: 0,1. Assign 0.\n\nNode 12: connected to 8,10 (color 1),17. Adjacent 10 (1), so assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nNode 13: connected to 2 (color 1), 11,19 (color 2). Adjacent colors 1 and 2. Assign 0.\n\nNode 16: connected to 20 (0),32,10 (color 1). Adjacent colors 0 and 1. Assign 2.\n\nNode 23: connected to 2 (color 1),4 (color 0),30. Adjacent colors 1 and 0. Assign 2.\n\nNode 30: connected to 23 (2),20 (0),32. Adjacent colors 0 and 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode 3: connected to 28 (color 1). Assign 0.\n\nNode 0: connected to 28 (color 1). Assign 0.\n\nNode 1: connected to 33. Assign 0, but check 33's color later.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should track the colors as I go step by step, using the greedy approach.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to proceed by processing nodes in order of decreasing degree, assigning the smallest possible color not used by already colored neighbors.\n\nSo let's list the nodes in order of highest degree first:\n\nOrder: 20, 28,5,19,10,30,23,2,4,16,12,13,15,25,26, etc. Wait, perhaps I need to compute the exact order.\n\nBut perhaps a more manageable approach is to process nodes in the following order:\n\n20 (6), 28 (5),5 (5),19 (4),10 (4),30 (3),23 (3),2 (3),4 (3),16 (3),12 (3),13 (3), etc.\n\nNow, let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. Node 20: color 0.\n\nAdjacent: 16,26,28,19,21,30.\n\n2. Node 28: adjacent to 20 (0). Assign color 1.\n\n3. Node 5: adjacent to 28 (1). Assign color 0.\n\n4. Node 19: adjacent to 20 (0) and 28 (1). Assign color 2.\n\n5. Node 10: adjacent to 5 (0). Assign color 1.\n\n6. Node 30: adjacent to 20 (0) and 23 (not colored yet), 32. Assign color 1 (since 20 is 0. But adjacent to 23 is not yet colored. So available colors: 0 is taken by 20. So possible colors are 1 and 2. Assign 1. But need to check later if this causes conflict.\n\n7. Node 23: adjacent to 2 (not colored),4 (not colored),30 (color 1). So if 23 is colored now, adjacent to 30 (1). Assign color 0. But 2 and 4 are not colored yet, so their colors are not considered here. However, this may cause issues when 2 and 4 are colored later. Wait, perhaps this approach is not correct because some neighbors may be processed later. So, the greedy algorithm with ordering by degree may help here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to process nodes in order of degree, and for each node, check the colors of already processed neighbors (since unprocessed neighbors haven't been assigned colors yet). This way, the assignment is correct.\n\nSo let's reorient: process nodes in order of decreasing degree. For each node, assign the smallest possible color not used by any of its already colored neighbors. Since we process high-degree nodes first, their neighbors are more likely to be unprocessed, but the ones that are processed are handled correctly.\n\nSo let's create the order again, sorted by degree descending:\n\nNodes and their degrees:\n\n20:6\n\n28:5\n\n5:5\n\n19:4\n\n10:4\n\n30:3 (connected to 23,20,32)\n\n23:3 (connected to 2,4,30)\n\n2:3 (connected to 5,23,13)\n\n4:3 (connected to 23,19,25)\n\n16:3 (connected to 20,32,10)\n\n12:3 (connected to 8,10,17)\n\n13:3 (connected to 2,11,19)\n\n25:2 (14 and 4)\n\n15:3 (21,6,14)\n\n26:1 (connected to 20)\n\n32:3 (connected to 16,30)\n\n31:3 (5,10,9)\n\n8:2 (5,12)\n\n9:2 (31,18)\n\n17:2 (12,18)\n\n14:2 (25,15)\n\n6:1 (15)\n\n7:1 (29)\n\n3:1 (28)\n\n0:1 (28)\n\n1:1 (33)\n\n18:2 (17,9)\n\n29:1 (7)\n\n21:2 (15,20)\n\n22:0 (isolated)\n\n24:0 (isolated)\n\n25:2 (14,4)\n\n27:1 (11)\n\n33:1 (1)\n\nSo the order by descending degree:\n\n20 (6), 28 (5),5 (5),19 (4),10 (4),30 (3),23 (3),2 (3),4 (3),16 (3),12 (3),13 (3),32 (3),31 (3),25 (2),15 (3), etc. Wait, 30,23,2,4,16,12,13,32,31 all have degree 3. Then 25,15 have degree 3 or 2.\n\nWait, 25's degree is 2 (connected to 14 and 4). So maybe after the degree 3 nodes.\n\nSo the ordered list:\n\n20,28,5,19,10,30,23,2,4,16,12,13,32,31,15,25,26,21, etc.\n\nNow, proceed step by step:\n\n1. Node 20: color 0.\n\n2. Node 28: neighbors processed so far is 20 (color 0). Assign color 1.\n\n3. Node 5: neighbors processed are 28 (color 1). So assign color 0.\n\n4. Node 19: neighbors are 20 (0) and 28 (1). Assign color 2.\n\n5. Node 10: neighbors processed are 5 (0). Assign color 1.\n\n6. Node 30: neighbors processed are 20 (0) and 28 (1) (no, wait, 30 is connected to 20, 23, 32. None of these may be processed except 20 and 28. Wait, 30's edges are 23-30, 20-30, 30-32. So neighbors are 23,20,32. Processed neighbors are 20 (0) and 28 (28 is not a neighbor of 30). So processed neighbors for 30 are 20 (0). Assign the smallest color not used by 20 → color 1.\n\n7. Node 23: neighbors are 2,4,30. Processed neighbors: 30 (color 1). So assign the smallest available (0).\n\n8. Node 2: neighbors are 5 (0),23 (0),13. So processed neighbors are 5 and 23, which are 0 and 0. So cannot use 0. Assign 1.\n\n9. Node 4: neighbors are 23 (0),19 (2),25. Processed neighbors are 23 (0) and 19 (2). So available color is 1.\n\n10. Node 16: neighbors are 20 (0),32,10 (1). Processed neighbors: 20 and 10, colors 0 and 1. Assign 2.\n\n11. Node 12: neighbors are 8,10 (1),17. Processed neighbors: 10 (1). Assign 0.\n\n12. Node 13: neighbors are 2 (1),11,19 (2). Processed neighbors: 2 (1), 19 (2). Available color: 0.\n\n13. Node 32: neighbors are 16 (2),30 (1). Assign 0.\n\n14. Node 31: neighbors are 5 (0),10 (1),9. Processed neighbors: 5 (0), 10 (1). Assign 2.\n\n15. Node 15: neighbors are 21,6,14. Processed neighbors: none yet. Assign 0.\n\n16. Node 25: neighbors are 14,4 (1). Assign 0 (since 4 is 1, and 14 not processed).\n\nWait, but node 25 is connected to 14 and 4. At this step, node 4 is colored 1, and node 14 hasn't been processed yet. So assign the smallest color not used by 4 (1). So color 0.\n\n17. Node 26: connected to 20 (0). Assign 1.\n\n18. Node 21: connected to 15 (0),20 (0). Both are color 0. So assign 1.\n\n19. Node 32: already processed in step 13.\n\nNow, nodes 8,9,17,18, etc.:\n\nProceeding:\n\n20. Node 8: connected to 5 (0),12 (0). Assign 1.\n\n21. Node 9: connected to 31 (2),18. Assign 0.\n\n22. Node 17: connected to 12 (0),18. Assign 1.\n\n23. Node 18: connected to 17 (1),9 (0). Assign 2.\n\n24. Node 14: connected to 25 (0),15 (0). Assign 1.\n\n25. Node 6: connected to 15 (0). Assign 1.\n\n26. Node 7: connected to 29. Assign 0.\n\n27. Node 3: connected to 28 (1). Assign 0.\n\n28. Node 0: connected to 28 (1). Assign 0.\n\n29. Node 1: connected to 33. Assign 0. Then node 33: assign 1.\n\n30. Node 11: connected to 13 (0),27. Assign 1.\n\n31. Node 27: connected to 11 (1). Assign 0.\n\n32. Node 29: connected to 7 (0). Assign 1.\n\n33. Node 22: isolated. Assign 0.\n\n34. Node 24: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nBut wait, node numbers go up to 33. Let's check for any nodes missed.\n\nWait, in the list of nodes, it's 0 to 33 (34 nodes). Let's verify all nodes are covered.\n\nAfter the steps above, all nodes are processed except perhaps node 24. Let's check:\n\nNodes processed in order:\n\n20,28,5,19,10,30,23,2,4,16,12,13,32,31,15,25,26,21,8,9,17,18,14,6,7,3,0,1,33,11,27,29,22,24.\n\nYes, 34 nodes.\n\nNow, let's compile the color assignments:\n\nNode 20: 0\n\nNode 28:1\n\nNode5:0\n\nNode19:2\n\nNode10:1\n\nNode30:1\n\nNode23:0\n\nNode2:1\n\nNode4:1\n\nNode16:2\n\nNode12:0\n\nNode13:0\n\nNode32:0\n\nNode31:2\n\nNode15:0\n\nNode25:0\n\nNode26:1\n\nNode21:1\n\nNode8:1\n\nNode9:0\n\nNode17:1\n\nNode18:2\n\nNode14:1\n\nNode6:1\n\nNode7:0\n\nNode3:0\n\nNode0:0\n\nNode1:0\n\nNode33:1\n\nNode11:1\n\nNode27:0\n\nNode29:1\n\nNode22:0\n\nNode24:0.\n\nWait, but let's check for any conflicts.\n\nFor example, node 20 (0) is connected to 28 (1), 19 (2), 30 (1), 21 (1), 16 (2), 26 (1). No conflicts.\n\nNode 5 (0) is connected to 28 (1), 10 (1), 2 (1), 31 (2), 8 (1). So all adjacent nodes have colors different from 0. Okay.\n\nNode 23 (0) is connected to 2 (1),4 (1),30 (1). So color 0 is okay.\n\nNode 30 (1) is connected to 23 (0), 20 (0),32 (0). So color 1 is okay.\n\nNode 31 (2) is connected to 5 (0),10 (1),9 (0). Color 2 is okay.\n\nNode 12 (0) is connected to 8 (1),10 (1),17 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 13 (0) connected to 2 (1),19 (2),11 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 16 (2) connected to 20 (0),10 (1),32 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 4 (1) connected to 23 (0),19 (2),25 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 2 (1) connected to 5 (0),23 (0),13 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 10 (1) connected to 5 (0),12 (0),16 (2),31 (2). Okay.\n\nNode 19 (2) connected to 20 (0),13 (0),4 (1),28 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 28 (1) connected to 20 (0),5 (0),3 (0),19 (2),0 (0). So all adjacent colors are 0 or 2, so 1 is okay.\n\nNode 32 (0) connected to 16 (2),30 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 25 (0) connected to 14 (1),4 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 15 (0) connected to 21 (1),6 (1),14 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 26 (1) connected to 20 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 21 (1) connected to 15 (0),20 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 8 (1) connected to 5 (0),12 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 9 (0) connected to 31 (2),18 (2). Okay.\n\nNode 17 (1) connected to 12 (0),18 (2). Okay.\n\nNode 18 (2) connected to 17 (1),9 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 14 (1) connected to 25 (0),15 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 6 (1) connected to 15 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 7 (0) connected to 29 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 3 (0) connected to 28 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 0 (0) connected to 28 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 1 (0) connected to 33 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 33 (1) connected to 1 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 11 (1) connected to 13 (0),27 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 27 (0) connected to 11 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 29 (1) connected to 7 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 22 (0) is isolated. Okay.\n\nNode 24 (0) is isolated. Okay.\n\nThis seems to work. All adjacent nodes have different colors. So the coloring is valid with 3 colors. The colors used are 0,1,2. Each node is colored appropriately.\n\nNow, compiling this into the required list of pairs:\n\n[[0,0], [1,0], [2,1], [3,0], [4,1], [5,0], [6,1], [7,0], [8,1], [9,0], [10,1], [11,1], [12,0], [13,0], [14,1], [15,0], [16,2], [17,1], [18,2], [19,2], [20,0], [21,1], [22,0], [23,0], [24,0], [25,0], [26,1], [27,0], [28,1], [29,1], [30,1], [31,2], [32,0], [33,1]]\n\nWait, let me go through each node and check their color:\n\nNode 0:0 → correct.\n\nNode 1:0 → connected to 33 (color 1). Okay.\n\nNode 2:1 → correct.\n\nNode 3:0 → connected to 28 (1). Okay.\n\nNode4:1 → connected to 23 (0),19 (2),25 (0). Okay.\n\nNode5:0 → correct.\n\nNode6:1 → connected to 15 (0).

Let's start by looking at the nodes and edges to figure out possible conflicts. The graph has 34 nodes (from 0 to 33) and a bunch of edges. The goal is to assign each node a color from 0, 1, or 2 such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges to understand the connections better. Let me go through each edge and note which nodes are connected. This will help me identify which nodes can't have the same color.\n\nLooking at the edges, some nodes have multiple connections. For example, node 6 is connected to 27 and 33, and node 22 connects to 26, 24, 4, 6, 11, etc. Nodes with many edges will be more challenging, so maybe I should start with them to avoid color conflicts.\n\nLet me pick a strategy. Maybe a greedy algorithm where I process nodes in order, assigning the lowest possible color that isn't used by adjacent nodes. But since the nodes are numbered up to 33, perhaps I should process them in order from 0 to 33, checking their neighbors each time.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to find a node with high degree and color it first, then proceed to its neighbors. Let's see which nodes have the highest degrees.\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\n- Node 4 is connected to 11, 29, 32, 22, 25. Wait, let's count:\n\nEdges involving node 4: 4-11, 4-29, 4-32, 4-22, 4-25. That's 5 edges. So degree 5.\n\nNode 22: connected to 26, 24, 4, 6, 11, 26 (from 22-26 and 3-26?), wait let's check:\n\nEdges with 22:\n\n22-26, 11-22, 6-22, 4-22, 22-24. So that's five edges as well. So node 22 has degree 5.\n\nNode 32: connected to 20, 31, 7, 30, 4. Wait edges for 32: 20-32, 31-32,7-32,30-32,4-32. That's five edges. So node 32 also has degree 5.\n\nSimilarly, node 6 is connected to 27, 33, 22. Degree 3. Node 10 connects to 12,18,33. Degree 3. Node 28 connects to 23, 27,30. Degree 3. Hmm.\n\nSo nodes 4, 22, 32 have the highest degrees. Let's start with those.\n\nStarting with node 4. Assign color 0. Then, its neighbors (11,29,32,22,25) can't be color 0.\n\nNext, node 22. Its neighbors are 26,24,4 (color 0),6,11. So color for 22 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Now, neighbors of 22 (like 26, 24, 4,6,11) can't be 1. But 4 is already 0. So for 22's neighbors, 26,24,6,11 must avoid 1.\n\nThen node 32. Neighbors are 20,31,7,30,4 (color 0). So 32 can't be 0. Assign color 1. But wait, node 32 is adjacent to node 4 (color 0), so 32 can be 1. Then, neighbors of 32 (20,31,7,30) can't be 1. But maybe I should check if node 32's neighbors have other constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe node 32 should be a different color. Let's see. Since node 4 is color 0, node 32 can be color 1. Then, node 30 is connected to 32 (so 30 can't be 1). Let's proceed.\n\nBut perhaps I should create a list of nodes and track their colors as I go. Let me try to proceed step by step.\n\nLet me list all nodes and their adjacent nodes. That might take some time, but it's necessary to avoid conflicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe process nodes in order and assign the lowest possible color not used by already colored neighbors.\n\nStarting from node 0, then 1, 2, etc. Let's try that.\n\nNode 0: connected to 13. So when coloring node 0, check if 13 is colored. If not, assign color 0. But since we're processing nodes in order, 0 comes before 13. So 0 can be color 0. Then, node 13 must not be color 0.\n\nNode 1: connected to 30. Node 1 can take color 0 (since its neighbor 30 is not yet colored). But when 30 is processed later, it can't be 0. But maybe that's okay.\n\nWait, but this approach might lead to conflicts later. For example, if node 1 is color 0, then node 30 must not be 0. But node 30 is connected to multiple nodes: 28, 32, 19, 1. So maybe better to color node 30 later.\n\nAlternatively, using a backtracking approach might be better, but with 34 nodes, that's too time-consuming. So perhaps the greedy approach with ordering based on degree.\n\nAnother approach: order the nodes in decreasing order of degree. So process high-degree nodes first. That could help avoid conflicts.\n\nSo the nodes with the highest degrees are 4,22,32 (degree 5), then nodes like 30 (connected to 28,32,19,1,30's edges: 28-30,30-32,19-30,1-30. So four edges. So degree 4.\n\nLet me list nodes by degree:\n\nNode 4: 5 edges\n\nNode 22:5 edges\n\nNode32:5 edges\n\nThen nodes like 6 (3), 10 (3), 28 (3), 30 (4), 11 (connected to 4,8,22. So 3 edges), 7 (connected to 32,8,12. 3 edges), etc.\n\nSo maybe process nodes in the order of 4,22,32,30, etc.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStart with node 4. Assign color 0. Now, its neighbors (11,29,32,22,25) can't be 0.\n\nNext, node 22. Neighbors: 26,24,4 (0),6,11. So available colors are 1 and 2. Assign color 1. Now neighbors (26,24,6,11) can't be 1.\n\nNext, node32. Neighbors:20,31,7,30,4 (0). So can't be 0. Assign next available color, 1. But check if any neighbors have color 1. 32's neighbors are 20,31,7,30. None are colored yet. So 32 can be 1. Now, neighbors (20,31,7,30) can't be 1.\n\nNext, node30. Connected to 28,32 (color 1),19,1. So can't be 1. Assign color 0. But check if neighbors allow it. Node 28 is not colored yet. Node19: not colored. Node1: not colored. So color 0 is possible. Assign 0. Now, node30's neighbors (28,32 (1),19,1) can't be 0. So when coloring 28,19,1, they can't be 0.\n\nNext, node11. Connected to 4 (0),8,22 (1). So can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2.\n\nNode26: connected to 16,22 (1),3. Assign color 0 (if possible). Check neighbors: 16 not colored, 22 is 1, 3 not colored. So color 0 is okay. Assign 0.\n\nNode6: connected to 27,33,22 (1). So can't be 1. Assign 0. But check if possible. Neighbors 27 and 33 not colored. So yes. Assign 0.\n\nNode28: connected to23,27,30 (0). Can't be 0. Assign 1. Then neighbors (23,27) can't be 1.\n\nNode23: connected to13,28 (1),19. So can't be 1. Assign 0. Check if 13 is colored. Node13 is connected to 0 (0). So 13 can't be 0. Assign color 1? Wait, 23's neighbors: 13 (not colored), 28 (1),19 (not colored). So 23 can be 0 if possible. Wait, 23's color can be 0, but node13 is connected to 0 (colored 0). So when node13 is processed, it can't be 0. So 23 can be 0. Assign 0. Then node13, when processed, can't be 0.\n\nNode19: connected to30 (0),23 (0). So can't be 0. Assign 1. Check neighbors: 30 is 0, 23 is 0. So yes, 1 is okay. Assign 1.\n\nNode1: connected to30 (0). So can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode3: connected to26 (0),31. So can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode25: connected to4 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode24: connected to22 (1),29. Assign 0 (since 22 is 1). Check neighbor 29. If 29 is not colored yet, then 0 is okay. Assign 0. Then neighbor29 can't be 0.\n\nNode29: connected to4 (0),24 (0). So can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode20: connected to32 (1). Assign 0.\n\nNode31: connected to32 (1),3 (1). So can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\nNode7: connected to32 (1),8,12. Assign 0 (check neighbors: 32 is 1, 8 and 12 not colored). Assign 0.\n\nNode8: connected to2,11 (2),7 (0). So can't be 0 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode12: connected to10,7 (0). Assign 1 (can't be 0). Check neighbor10. Not colored yet.\n\nNode10: connected to12 (1),18,33. Assign 0. Then 12 is 1, so okay. Neighbors 18 and 33 can't be 0.\n\nNode18: connected to10 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode33: connected to6 (0),10 (0). Can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode27: connected to6 (0),28 (1),14. Assign 2 (can't be 0 or 1). Then neighbors14 can't be 2.\n\nNode14: connected to9,5,27 (2). Assign 0. Check if 9 is processed. Node9 is connected to14. Assign color 1 (since 14 is 0).\n\nNode5: connected to14 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode9: connected to14 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode2: connected to8 (1),16,19 (1). So can't be 1. Assign 0. Check neighbors: 8 is 1, 16 and 19 (1). So 0 is okay.\n\nNode16: connected to26 (0),2 (0). So can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode17: No edges listed. So can be any color. Assign 0.\n\nNode13: connected to0 (0),23 (0). So can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode15: Not mentioned in edges. So no edges. Assign 0.\n\nWait, wait. The nodes are from 0 to 33. But the edges listed don't include some nodes. For example, nodes 15,17,21, etc. So those nodes have no edges. So they can be colored with any color. Let's assign them color 0 for simplicity.\n\nSo let's go through all nodes step by step, even those with no edges.\n\nBut I need to make sure that all 34 nodes are colored. Let me list all nodes from 0 to 33 and check if I have colors assigned.\n\nSo far, nodes processed:\n\n0:0\n\n1:1\n\n2:0\n\n3:1\n\n4:0\n\n5:1\n\n6:0\n\n7:0\n\n8:1\n\n9:1\n\n10:0\n\n11:2\n\n12:1\n\n13:1\n\n14:0\n\n15: Not mentioned. Assign 0.\n\n16:1\n\n17:0\n\n18:1\n\n19:1\n\n20:0\n\n21:0 (no edges)\n\n22:1\n\n23:0\n\n24:0\n\n25:1\n\n26:0\n\n27:2\n\n28:1\n\n29:1\n\n30:0\n\n31:0\n\n32:1\n\n33:1\n\nWait, node17: no edges. So assign 0. Node21: no edges. Assign 0. Node15: no edges. Assign 0.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the nodes are listed as 0 to 33. Let's check if all nodes are covered.\n\nYes: nodes 0-33. So I need to make sure all are accounted for.\n\nLet me list them all:\n\n0:0 (edge with 13)\n\n1:1 (edge with30)\n\n2:0 (edges with8,16,19)\n\n3:1 (edges with26,31)\n\n4:0\n\n5:1 (edge with14)\n\n6:0 (edges with27,33,22)\n\n7:0 (edges with32,8,12)\n\n8:1 (edges with2,11,7)\n\n9:1 (edge with14)\n\n10:0 (edges with12,18,33)\n\n11:2 (edges with4,8,22)\n\n12:1 (edges with10,7)\n\n13:1 (edges with0,23)\n\n14:0 (edges with9,5,27)\n\n15:0 (no edges)\n\n16:1 (edges with26,2)\n\n17:0 (no edges)\n\n18:1 (edge with10)\n\n19:1 (edges with30,23,2)\n\n20:0 (edge with32)\n\n21:0 (no edges)\n\n22:1 (edges with26,24,4,6,11)\n\n23:0 (edges with13,28,19)\n\n24:0 (edges with22,29)\n\n25:1 (edge with4)\n\n26:0 (edges with16,22,3)\n\n27:2 (edges with6,28,14)\n\n28:1 (edges with23,27,30)\n\n29:1 (edges with4,24)\n\n30:0 (edges with28,32,19,1)\n\n31:0 (edges with32,3)\n\n32:1 (edges with20,31,7,30,4)\n\n33:1 (edges with6,10)\n\nWait, but node25 is connected to 4 (edge 4-25). So node25 is connected to node4 (color0). So node25's color can't be 0. But I assigned it 1, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, node3 is connected to26 (color0) and 31 (color0). So node3 can't be 0. It was assigned 1. Correct.\n\nNow check for any adjacent nodes with the same color.\n\nLet me check some edges:\n\n16-26: node16 is 1, node26 is 0. Okay.\n\n6-27:6 is 0,27 is 2. Okay.\n\n6-33:6 is0,33 is1. Okay.\n\n20-32:20 is0,32 is1. Okay.\n\n31-32:31 is0,32 is1. Okay.\n\n7-32:7 is0,32 is1. Okay.\n\n23-28:23 is0,28 is1. Okay.\n\n22-26:22 is1,26 is0. Okay.\n\n9-14:9 is1,14 is0. Okay.\n\n3-31:3 is1,31 is0. Okay.\n\n10-12:10 is0,12 is1. Okay.\n\n27-28:27 is2,28 is1. Okay.\n\n28-30:28 is1,30 is0. Okay.\n\n2-8:2 is0,8 is1. Okay.\n\n10-18:10 is0,18 is1. Okay.\n\n19-30:19 is1,30 is0. Okay.\n\n24-29:24 is0,29 is1. Okay.\n\n4-11:4 is0,11 is2. Okay.\n\n8-11:8 is1,11 is2. Okay.\n\n4-29:4 is0,29 is1. Okay.\n\n14-27:14 is0,27 is2. Okay.\n\n19-23:19 is1,23 is0. Okay.\n\n4-32:4 is0,32 is1. Okay.\n\n3-26:3 is1,26 is0. Okay.\n\n4-25:4 is0,25 is1. Okay.\n\n7-8:7 is0,8 is1. Okay.\n\nCheck if any edges connect nodes with the same color.\n\nWhat about node 22's edges:\n\n22 is1. Its neighbors:\n\n26 is0, 24 is0,4 is0,6 is0,11 is2. All different. Good.\n\nNode 30 is0. Its neighbors:\n\n28 is1,32 is1,19 is1,1 is1. All different.\n\nNode 11 is2. Its neighbors:\n\n4 is0,8 is1,22 is1. All different.\n\nNode 27 is2. Its neighbors:\n\n6 is0,28 is1,14 is0. All okay.\n\nNode 12 is1. Neighbors 10 is0,7 is0. Good.\n\nNode 0 is0. Neighbor13 is1. Good.\n\nNode 5 is1. Neighbor14 is0. Good.\n\nNode 9 is1. Neighbor14 is0. Good.\n\nNode 25 is1. Neighbor4 is0. Good.\n\nNode17 and 21 and 15: all 0 and not connected to anyone. So okay.\n\nLooks like this coloring works. All edges connect nodes with different colors. And it uses exactly 3 colors (0,1,2). The colors used are 0,1,2, as required.\n\nSo the answer should be a list of [node, color] pairs for all nodes from 0 to 33 in order. Let me compile that list:\n\n[\n[0,0], [1,1], [2,0], [3,1], [4,0], [5,1], [6,0], [7,0], [8,1], [9,1], [10,0], [11,2], [12,1], [13,1], [14,0], [15,0], [16,1], [17,0], [18,1], [19,1], [20,0], [21,0], [22,1], [23,0], [24,0], [25,1], [26,0], [27,2], [28,1], [29,1], [30,0], [31,0], [32,1], [33,1]\n]\n\nWait, let me double-check each node:\n\nNode 0:0\n\nNode1:1\n\nNode2:0\n\nNode3:1\n\nNode4:0\n\nNode5:1\n\nNode6:0\n\nNode7:0\n\nNode8:1\n\nNode9:1\n\nNode10:0\n\nNode11:2\n\nNode12:1\n\nNode13:1\n\nNode14:0\n\nNode15:0\n\nNode16:1\n\nNode17:0\n\nNode18:1\n\nNode19:1\n\nNode20:0\n\nNode21:0\n\nNode22:1\n\nNode23:0\n\nNode24:0\n\nNode25:1\n\nNode26:0\n\nNode27:2\n\nNode28:1\n\nNode29:1\n\nNode30:0\n\nNode31:0\n\nNode32:1\n\nNode33:1\n\nYes. All nodes are included. And each adjacent pair has different colors as checked earlier.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the graph. The nodes are from 0 to 21, so 22 nodes in total. The edges are given, so I should list them out and see the connections. Let me first parse all the edges to see which nodes are connected to each other.\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\n12-19, 3-16, 5-16, 1-6, 0-14, 19-21, 1-3, 10-21, 1-15, 13-20, 6-8, 7-13, 12-15, 10-17, 1-20, 13-19, 6-13, 7-21, 6-19, 4-16, 17-19, 0-9, 1-4, 0-6, 0-18, 7-11.\n\nSo, let's note down the adjacency list for each node. Maybe that will help visualize which nodes are connected and need different colors.\n\nStarting with node 0: connected to 14, 9, 6, 18. So 0's neighbors are 14,9,6,18.\n\nNode 1: connected to 6,3,15,20,4. So neighbors are 6,3,15,20,4.\n\nNode 3: connected to 16,1. So neighbors 16 and 1.\n\nWait, let's do this properly. Maybe build an adjacency list step by step.\n\nLet me go through each edge and add to each node's list.\n\nEdge 12-19: add 19 to 12's list and 12 to 19's list.\n\n3-16: add 16 to 3's list and 3 to 16's list.\n\n5-16: 5's list gets 16, 16's list gets 5.\n\n1-6: 1 and 6 each get each other.\n\n0-14: 0 and 14 connected.\n\n19-21: 19 and 21.\n\n1-3: already added earlier.\n\n10-21: 10 and 21.\n\n1-15: 1 and 15.\n\n13-20: 13 and 20.\n\n6-8: 6 and 8.\n\n7-13:7 and 13.\n\n12-15:12 and15.\n\n10-17:10 and17.\n\n1-20:1 and20.\n\n13-19:13 and19.\n\n6-13:6 and13.\n\n7-21:7 and21.\n\n6-19:6 and19.\n\n4-16:4 and16.\n\n17-19:17 and19.\n\n0-9:0 and9.\n\n1-4:1 and4.\n\n0-6:0 and6.\n\n0-18:0 and18.\n\n7-11:7 and11.\n\nOkay, so let's list each node's neighbors:\n\nNode 0: 14,9,6,18.\n\nWait, from edges 0-14, 0-9, 0-6, 0-18. So yes.\n\nNode1: edges 1-6, 1-3, 1-15, 1-20, 1-4. So neighbors 6,3,15,20,4.\n\nNode2: Hmm, I don't see any edges listed for node 2. Wait, the nodes listed are 0-21. So node 2 exists but has no edges? So node 2 is isolated. That's good to know. So node 2 can be colored with any color, maybe 0.\n\nNode3: edges 3-16, 1-3. So neighbors 16 and1.\n\nNode4: edges 1-4, 4-16. So neighbors 1,16.\n\nNode5: edges 5-16. So neighbor 16.\n\nNode6: edges 1-6, 0-6, 6-8, 6-13, 6-19. So neighbors 1,0,8,13,19.\n\nNode7: edges 7-13,7-21,7-11. So neighbors 13,21,11.\n\nNode8: connected to 6.\n\nNode9: connected to 0.\n\nNode10: edges 10-21, 10-17. So neighbors 21,17.\n\nNode11: connected to7.\n\nNode12: edges12-19,12-15. So neighbors 19,15.\n\nNode13: edges13-20,7-13,6-13,13-19. So neighbors20,7,6,19.\n\nNode14: connected to0.\n\nNode15: edges12-15, 1-15. So neighbors12,1.\n\nNode16: edges3-16,5-16,4-16. So neighbors3,5,4.\n\nNode17: edges10-17,17-19. So neighbors10,19.\n\nNode18: connected to0.\n\nNode19: edges12-19,19-21,13-19,6-19,17-19. So neighbors12,21,13,6,17.\n\nWait, also 19 is connected to 6 (from 6-19), and 17 (17-19). So neighbors are 12,21,13,6,17.\n\nNode20: edges13-20,1-20. So neighbors13,1.\n\nNode21: edges19-21,10-21,7-21. So neighbors19,10,7.\n\nSo now, the adjacency list is built.\n\nNow, the goal is to assign colors 0,1,2 to each node such that adjacent nodes have different colors, and exactly 3 colors are used. Since the problem says \"exactly 3 colors\", we need to make sure that all three colors are used at least once.\n\nBut the main constraint is that adjacent nodes can't share the same color.\n\nSince node 2 is isolated, it can take any color. Let's assign color 0 to it. But need to check if other nodes can be colored with 3 colors.\n\nBut first, let's see if the graph is 3-colorable. Without knowing the structure, perhaps we can proceed with a greedy approach or backtracking.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start coloring nodes in order and assign the smallest possible color not used by their neighbors.\n\nLet me try to proceed step by step.\n\nList of nodes: 0-21. Let's process them in order from 0 to 21, assigning colors as we go, choosing the first available color that doesn't conflict with already colored neighbors.\n\nBut since the order can affect the result, perhaps we should order based on the degree. Higher degree nodes first.\n\nBut maybe let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for nodes with high degrees.\n\nLooking at the adjacency lists:\n\nNode6: degree 5 (neighbors 1,0,8,13,19)\n\nNode19: degree 5 (12,21,13,6,17)\n\nNode1: degree5 (6,3,15,20,4)\n\nNode13: degree4 (20,7,6,19)\n\nNode21: degree3 (19,10,7)\n\nNode0: degree4 (14,9,6,18)\n\nNode3: degree2 (16,1)\n\nNode4: degree2 (1,16)\n\nNode7: degree3 (13,21,11)\n\nNode12: degree2 (19,15)\n\nNode15: degree2 (12,1)\n\nNode10: degree2 (21,17)\n\nNode17: degree2 (10,19)\n\nNode16: degree3 (3,5,4)\n\nNode20: degree2 (13,1)\n\nNode5: degree1 (16)\n\nNode8: degree1 (6)\n\nNode9: degree1 (0)\n\nNode14: degree1 (0)\n\nNode18: degree1 (0)\n\nNode2: degree0.\n\nNode11: degree1 (7)\n\nSo node6,19,1 have the highest degrees (5 each). Let's start with them.\n\nBut perhaps assign color to node6 first. Let's say color 0.\n\nBut then all its neighbors (1,0,8,13,19) can't be color0.\n\nBut maybe better to pick a node, assign color, then proceed.\n\nAlternatively, since this is time-consuming, perhaps use a backtracking approach, but manually.\n\nAlternatively, try to color the nodes in order, using the three colors, and see.\n\nLet's start with node0. Assign color 0.\n\nThen, its neighbors (14,9,6,18) can't be color0.\n\nNext, node1. Assign color0. Wait, but node1 is connected to node6 (which is neighbor of node0). Wait, node0 is connected to node6. So if node0 is color0, then node6 can't be color0. Let me adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to process the nodes in an order where higher degree nodes are first.\n\nLet me list nodes by degree:\n\nNodes with degree 5:6,19,1.\n\nThen nodes with degree4:0,13.\n\nThen degree3:21,7,16.\n\nOthers lower.\n\nSo let's process nodes in the order of 6,19,1,13,0,21,7,16, etc.\n\nLet's try:\n\nStart with node6. Assign color0.\n\nNode6's neighbors:1,0,8,13,19 cannot be color0.\n\nNext, node19. Its neighbors:12,21,13,6,17. Since node6 is color0, node19 can't be 0. Assign color1.\n\nThen node1. Neighbors:6 (color0), so can't be 0. Assign color1.\n\nBut node1's other neighbors (3,15,20,4) will need to not be color1.\n\nNext, node13. Neighbors:20,7,6 (color0),19 (color1). So 13 can't be 0 or1. Assign color2.\n\nNode0. Neighbors:14,9,6 (color0),18. So 0 can't be same as 6. Assign color1.\n\nWait, node0 is connected to6 (color0). So node0 can't be 0. So assign color1.\n\nWait, but node0's color is being assigned now. Let's see:\n\nIf I process nodes in order 6,19,1,13,0:\n\n- Node6: color0.\n\n- Node19: color1.\n\n- Node1: color1 (since node6 is color0, but node1 is not connected to 19 or 6's color. Wait, node1 is connected to6 (color0). So node1 can't be color0. Assign color1.\n\nBut then, node1's neighbors (3,15,20,4) can't be color1.\n\nThen node13: neighbors are 20,7,6 (0),19 (1). So possible colors: 0 and 1 are taken by 6 and 19, so 13 must be color2.\n\nThen node0: neighbors include 6 (color0). So 0 can't be color0. Assign the next available, color1.\n\nThen proceed to node21, which is connected to19 (color1),10,7.\n\nSo node21 can't be color1. Assign color0.\n\nBut node21's neighbors also include 10 and7. If 10 and7 are not yet colored, maybe color21 as0.\n\nThen node7. Its neighbors are 13 (color2), 21 (color0), 11. So 7 can't be 0 or2. Assign color1.\n\nNode16's neighbors:3,5,4. Let's process node16. Assign color0.\n\nBut wait, node16's neighbors:3,5,4. Let's see:\n\nIf node3 has not been colored yet. Suppose node16's color is0, then its neighbors (3,5,4) can't be0.\n\nBut maybe node3 is connected to1 (color1). So node3's color can't be1. Let's see:\n\nProcessing node16. If node16 is assigned color0, then node3 (connected to16) can't be0.\n\nBut node3 is connected to1 (color1), so node3 can't be1. So node3 can be color0 or2.\n\nWait, but node16 is color0, so node3 can't be0, so node3 must be color2.\n\nProceeding step by step.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated, but let's try to proceed methodically.\n\nLet me create a table to track each node's color.\n\nInitialize all to null.\n\nProcess order: 6,19,1,13,0,21,7,16,3,12,15,10,17,4,5,20,8,9,14,18,11,2.\n\nThis order is based on high-degree nodes first and their neighbors.\n\n1. Node6: assign color0.\n\nAdjacent to 1,0,8,13,19. They can't be 0.\n\n2. Node19: neighbors are 6 (0), 12,21,13,17. Assign color1.\n\n3. Node1: neighbors 6 (0), 3,15,20,4. Assign color1. Now, adjacent nodes can't be1.\n\n4. Node13: neighbors 6 (0), 19 (1), 7,20. Assign color2.\n\n5. Node0: neighbors 6 (0). Assign color1.\n\n6. Node21: neighbors 19 (1),10,7. Assign color0.\n\n7. Node7: neighbors13 (2),21 (0),11. Assign color1.\n\n8. Node16: neighbors3,5,4. Assign color0.\n\n9. Node3: connected to1 (1) and16 (0). Can't be0 or1. Assign color2.\n\n10. Node12: connected to19 (1),15. Assign color0.\n\n11. Node15: connected to12 (0) and1 (1). Assign color2.\n\n12. Node10: connected to21 (0),17. Assign color1.\n\n13. Node17: connected to10 (1),19 (1). Assign color0.\n\n14. Node4: connected to1 (1),16 (0). Assign color2.\n\n15. Node5: connected to16 (0). Assign color1.\n\n16. Node20: connected to13 (2),1 (1). Assign color0.\n\n17. Node8: connected to6 (0). Assign color1.\n\n18. Node9: connected to0 (1). Assign color0.\n\n19. Node14: connected to0 (1). Assign color0.\n\n20. Node18: connected to0 (1). Assign color0.\n\n21. Node11: connected to7 (1). Assign color0.\n\n22. Node2: no edges. Assign color0.\n\nLet me check for conflicts now:\n\nCheck each node's color against its neighbors.\n\nNode0 (1):\n\nNeighbors:14 (0),9 (0),6 (0),18 (0). All different. Good.\n\nNode1 (1):\n\nNeighbors:6 (0),3 (2),15 (2),20 (0),4 (2). All different. Good.\n\nNode2 (0): No neighbors. Good.\n\nNode3 (2):\n\nNeighbors:16 (0),1 (1). Both different. Good.\n\nNode4 (2):\n\nNeighbors:1 (1),16 (0). Both different. Good.\n\nNode5 (1):\n\nNeighbor:16 (0). Good.\n\nNode6 (0):\n\nNeighbors:1 (1),0 (1),8 (1),13 (2),19 (1). All different except 0 and1. Wait, node0 is color1, which is neighbor of node6 (0), so that's okay. Wait, node6 is color0, and node0 is color1. That's okay. But node6's neighbors 1 (1),0 (1), etc. Wait, node1 is color1 and adjacent to node6 (0). That's allowed. So all neighbors have different colors. Yes.\n\nNode7 (1):\n\nNeighbors:13 (2),21 (0),11 (0). All different. Good.\n\nNode8 (1):\n\nNeighbor:6 (0). Good.\n\nNode9 (0):\n\nNeighbor:0 (1). Good.\n\nNode10 (1):\n\nNeighbors:21 (0),17 (0). Both 0, so color1 is okay.\n\nNode11 (0):\n\nNeighbor:7 (1). Good.\n\nNode12 (0):\n\nNeighbors:19 (1),15 (2). Both different. Good.\n\nNode13 (2):\n\nNeighbors:20 (0),7 (1),6 (0),19 (1). All different. Good.\n\nNode14 (0):\n\nNeighbor:0 (1). Good.\n\nNode15 (2):\n\nNeighbors:12 (0),1 (1). Good.\n\nNode16 (0):\n\nNeighbors:3 (2),5 (1),4 (2). All different. Good.\n\nNode17 (0):\n\nNeighbors:10 (1),19 (1). Both 1, so color0 is okay.\n\nNode18 (0):\n\nNeighbor:0 (1). Good.\n\nNode19 (1):\n\nNeighbors:12 (0),21 (0),13 (2),6 (0),17 (0). All different except 12,21,17 which are 0. So color1 is okay.\n\nNode20 (0):\n\nNeighbors:13 (2),1 (1). Good.\n\nNode21 (0):\n\nNeighbors:19 (1),10 (1),7 (1). All 1, so color0 is okay.\n\nNode2 (0): No neighbors. Good.\n\nNow, check if all three colors are used. Let's see:\n\nColor0: nodes6,12,16,21,9,14,18,2,11,20,5,8?\n\nWait:\n\nNode0:1\n\nNode1:1\n\nNode2:0\n\nNode3:2\n\nNode4:2\n\nNode5:1\n\nNode6:0\n\nNode7:1\n\nNode8:1\n\nNode9:0\n\nNode10:1\n\nNode11:0\n\nNode12:0\n\nNode13:2\n\nNode14:0\n\nNode15:2\n\nNode16:0\n\nNode17:0\n\nNode18:0\n\nNode19:1\n\nNode20:0\n\nNode21:0\n\nHmm, the colors used are 0,1,2. Let's check which nodes have color2.\n\nNodes3,4,13,15. So color2 is used. Yes.\n\nSo all three colors are present. So the coloring is valid.\n\nThe output should be a list of pairs for each node in order 0 to 21.\n\nLet's list them all:\n\n[[0,1], [1,1], [2,0], [3,2], [4,2], [5,1], [6,0], [7,1], [8,1], [9,0], [10,1], [11,0], [12,0], [13,2], [14,0], [15,2], [16,0], [17,0], [18,0], [19,1], [20,0], [21,0]]\n\nWait, let me make sure:\n\nNode0:1\n\nNode1:1\n\nNode2:0\n\nNode3:2\n\nNode4:2\n\nNode5:1\n\nNode6:0\n\nNode7:1\n\nNode8:1\n\nNode9:0\n\nNode10:1\n\nNode11:0\n\nNode12:0\n\nNode13:2\n\nNode14:0\n\nNode15:2\n\nNode16:0\n\nNode17:0\n\nNode18:0\n\nNode19:1\n\nNode20:0\n\nNode21:0\n\nWait, but node5 is assigned color1, node5's neighbor is16 (color0). That's okay. Node17 is color0, neighbors 10 (1) and19 (1). Good. Node20 is color0, neighbors13 (2) and1 (1). Good.\n\nYes, this seems to work. All adjacent nodes have different colors, and exactly three colors are used. So the answer should be this list.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0,1],[1,1],[2,0],[3,2],[4,2],[5,1],[6,0],[7,1],[8,1],[9,0],[10,1],[11,0],[12,0],[13,2],[14,0],[15,2],[16,0],[17,0],[18,0],[19,1],[20,0],[21,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

So, the goal is to assign colors to each node using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2) such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. Let's start by understanding the graph structure based on the edges provided.\n\nFirst, I need to list out all the edges to see which nodes are connected. Let me parse the edges one by one:\n\n0 is connected to 30 and 11 and 22.\n16 is connected to 35, 9, 11, 23, 4, 8, and others maybe? Wait, let's see:\n\nEdges list:\n0-30, 16-35, 15-33, 4-12, 26-36, 21-25, 18-32, 31-35, 21-34, 5-19, 17-18, 0-11, 3-34, 7-19, 7-37, 3-21, 22-28, 9-16, 5-21, 21-39, 11-16, 3-33, 9-28, 5-33, 28-29, 27-39, 14-39, 5-36, 2-19, 0-22, 11-25, 10-23, 10-29, 6-25, 4-16, 4-19, 22-30, 3-26, 8-16, 10-13, 4-31, 22-36, 9-33, 16-23.\n\nHmm, this is a lot. Maybe building an adjacency list would help. Let's try to note down each node and its neighbors.\n\nStarting with node 0: connected to 30, 11, 22. So neighbors are 30, 11, 22.\n\nNode 1: Wait, the nodes go from 0 to 39. Let's check if all nodes are present. The nodes listed are 0-39, so 40 nodes total. Each node must be colored.\n\nLet me create an adjacency list for each node. Let's go step by step.\n\n0: 30, 11, 22\n1: Hmm, looking at the edges, I don't see node 1 connected. Wait, the edges given are in the problem statement. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the edges provided:\n\nThe edges are:\n\n0 -30\n\n16-35\n\n15-33\n\n4-12\n\n26-36\n\n21-25\n\n18-32\n\n31-35\n\n21-34\n\n5-19\n\n17-18\n\n0-11\n\n3-34\n\n7-19\n\n7-37\n\n3-21\n\n22-28\n\n9-16\n\n5-21\n\n21-39\n\n11-16\n\n3-33\n\n9-28\n\n5-33\n\n28-29\n\n27-39\n\n14-39\n\n5-36\n\n2-19\n\n0-22\n\n11-25\n\n10-23\n\n10-29\n\n6-25\n\n4-16\n\n4-19\n\n22-30\n\n3-26\n\n8-16\n\n10-13\n\n4-31\n\n22-36\n\n9-33\n\n16-23\n\nSo, for example, node 1 isn't mentioned in any edge. So node 1 is isolated. That's possible. Similarly, some other nodes might be isolated. Let me check which nodes are isolated.\n\nLooking through the edges, let's see:\n\nWhich nodes are present? For example, node 0, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,21,22,23,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,39.\n\nWait, missing nodes are 1, 20, 24, 38? Let's check:\n\nWait the nodes are 0-39. In the edges, nodes present:\n\nCheck if node 20 is present? Scanning through the edges: no. So nodes 1, 20, 24, 38, etc. are not connected to any edges, so they are isolated. Wait, 38: in the edges, is there a 38? Let's check again: the edges end with 16-23. So nodes 20, 24, 38 are not connected. So those nodes can be colored with any color, but since we need exactly 3 colors, but the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\" which probably means that all three colors must be used, but the nodes can be colored in any way as long as adjacent nodes don't share. Wait, no—the exact number of colors specified is 3, so the colors are 0,1,2, but the coloring must use exactly 3 colors. So the solution can use any subset of the three, but the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\". Wait, no, the colors are numbered 0-2, and the answer must use those three. So each node must be assigned one of the three colors, and adjacent nodes can't share the same.\n\nBut for isolated nodes, they can be colored any of the three. So the presence of isolated nodes allows flexibility.\n\nNow, the challenge is to assign colors to all nodes, considering the connections. Let's proceed.\n\nFirst, handle the connected components. The graph is split into connected components. Some nodes are isolated (like 1, 20, etc.), others are part of larger components.\n\nBut the main challenge is the connected components. For example, the nodes 0 is connected to 30, 11, 22. Let's see the structure.\n\nBut building the entire adjacency list would take time. Alternatively, maybe proceed with a greedy coloring approach, assigning colors in a way that each node takes the smallest possible color not used by its neighbors.\n\nBut with 3 colors, and if the graph is 3-colorable, which it is (since the problem says to provide a valid scheme), we need to find such a coloring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the graph is a bipartite graph (2-colorable) but the problem requires using 3 colors. So perhaps some components are not bipartite, hence needing 3 colors.\n\nWait, but bipartite graphs can be colored with 2 colors, but if the graph isn't bipartite (contains odd-length cycles), then it's not 2-colorable. So in that case, 3 colors are needed.\n\nBut the problem says to use exactly 3 colors. So perhaps some components require 3 colors, and others can use 1 or 2. But since the problem says to use exactly 3, perhaps all three colors must be present in the final coloring. Wait, but the user instruction says \"using exactly the number of colors specified\" which in this case is 3. So the coloring must not use more than 3, but can use fewer. However, the question says \"using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2)\". Wait, perhaps the answer must use all three colors. Because, otherwise, if the graph is bipartite, you could use 2 colors. But the problem says to use exactly 3. So maybe the problem requires that the coloring uses all three colors. Wait, but the way the problem is phrased: \"Provide a valid coloring scheme for the graph using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2)\". So \"exactly 3 colors\" here might mean that you can't use more than 3 (i.e., colors 0,1,2), but you can use all three. So the answer must be a valid 3-coloring, which is a coloring that uses at most 3 colors. The problem may not require that all three are used, but the user could have a typo. Hmm. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"using exactly 3 colors specified.\" Hmm, maybe it's a translation issue. The original instruction says \"exact number of colors specified\", which is 3. So the coloring must use exactly 3 colors, not more, not less. Wait, but colors are numbered from 0 to 2. So if it's possible to color the graph with 2 colors, but the problem requires 3, that's impossible. So perhaps the graph requires 3 colors. So I need to make sure that all three colors are used in the coloring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows using up to 3 colors, but requires that exactly 3 are available. But the problem's phrasing is a bit ambiguous. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"Provide a valid coloring scheme for the graph using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2).\"\n\nSo the colors are 0,1,2, and the solution must be a 3-coloring. So each node gets one of the three colors, and adjacent nodes have different colors. The solution can use any of the three colors, but not more. So the answer is a valid 3-coloring, which uses 3 colors (but may use all three or just some). However, the problem doesn't state that all three must be used, so perhaps just using 3 colors as the maximum allowed.\n\nBut since the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\", perhaps it's required that all three colors are present in the coloring. Otherwise, if a graph can be colored with two colors, but the problem says to use three, then that's conflicting. However, in such a case, you can still use three colors by assigning some nodes color 2. For example, if the graph is bipartite, you could color it with two colors, but to use three, just assign color 2 to some node where possible. Wait, but in bipartite graphs, each node is in one partition. So you could color one partition with 0 and 1, and the other with 2, but that might not work because adjacent nodes would be from different partitions. So perhaps if the graph can be colored with two colors, but we have to use three, then we can recolor some nodes to use the third color as long as they don't conflict.\n\nBut perhaps the graph here is not bipartite. For example, if there's a cycle of odd length, then it's not bipartite and requires at least three colors. So maybe this graph has such cycles.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the approach is to proceed with a greedy coloring, assigning the lowest possible color not used by adjacent nodes. Let's start by ordering the nodes and assigning colors.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to output a JSON list of pairs, perhaps a way is to pick an order of nodes and assign colors step by step.\n\nLet me start with node 0. Assign color 0. Then its neighbors (30, 11, 22) can't be color 0.\n\nSo:\n\n0: 0\n\n30: 1\n\n11: 1\n\n22: 1\n\nBut wait, node 0 is connected to 30, 11, and 22. So all three must not be color 0.\n\nBut maybe assigning color 0 to node 0, then assign color 1 to 30, 11, 22. But then, for example, node 30 is connected to 0 and 22 (since 0 is connected to 22, 30 is connected to 0, and 22 is connected to 30 via 0's edges? Wait no, node 0 is connected to 30 and 22. The edge 22-30 is also present. So nodes 22 and 30 are connected. So if 30 is color 1 and 22 is color 1, that's a problem because they are connected. So in that case, 30 and 22 can't have the same color.\n\nOh, right! Because 22 and 30 are connected via the edge 22-30. So if I assign color 1 to both 30 and 22, that's invalid. So this initial approach is flawed.\n\nSo when assigning colors to neighbors, we need to ensure that the neighbors that are connected to each other also have different colors.\n\nTherefore, perhaps a better approach is to process the nodes in an order that allows such conflicts to be handled.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick a node and assign colors step by step, making sure that each time we assign a color that doesn't conflict with already assigned neighbors.\n\nLet's proceed with node 0: color 0.\n\nThen, node 30 is connected to 0. So possible colors: 1, 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode 22 is connected to 0 and 30 (due to edge 22-30). So node 22's color can't be 0 (from node 0) or 1 (from node 30). So color 2.\n\nThen, node 30's other neighbors: node 0 (already handled), and 22 (color 2). So node 30 is color 1, which is okay.\n\nNext, node 11: connected to 0 (color 0) and 16 (which we haven't colored yet). So node 11 can't be 0. Let's assign color 1. Then node 11's neighbors (0 and 16) must have different colors. But 16 hasn't been colored yet. So when we get to node 16, we need to ensure it's not color 1.\n\nProceeding, perhaps it's better to process nodes in a specific order, maybe starting with nodes that have higher degrees.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps a better approach is to look for possible conflicts and adjust accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to create a color assignment step by step.\n\nLet's create a list of all nodes from 0 to 39. For each node, track their color and their neighbors.\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Let's try to proceed in an order.\n\nStart with node 0: color 0.\n\nNeighbors: 30, 11, 22.\n\nFor node 30: can't be 0. Assign color 1.\n\nNode 22: connected to 0 and 30 (since 0-22 and 22-30). So 22 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2.\n\nNode 11: connected to 0 (0) and 16. Assign color 1.\n\nNow, node 11's neighbor 16: when we color 16, it can't be color 1 (since 11 is color 1).\n\nNext, node 30's other neighbors: check if there are any. The edges list has 0-30, 22-30. So node 30's neighbors are 0 and 22. So 30's color is 1, which is okay.\n\nNode 22's neighbors: 0 (0), 30 (1), 28, 36 (from edges 22-28, 22-36).\n\nSo when we get to nodes 28 and 36, we need to ensure they aren't color 2 (since 22 is color 2).\n\nProceeding to node 11's neighbor 16. Let's color node 16 next.\n\nNode 16's neighbors: 35, 9, 11 (color 1), 23, 4, 8, 16-35, 9-16, 11-16, 4-16, 8-16, 16-23.\n\nSo node 16 has neighbors 35, 9, 11 (1), 23, 4, 8, etc. So when coloring node 16, the colors used by its neighbors (so far, 11 is color 1). So node 16 can't be 1. Let's assign color 0. So node 16: color 0.\n\nThen, neighbors of 16 must not be 0. So node 35, 9, 23, 4, 8, etc. should have different colors.\n\nProceeding to node 35: connected to 16 (0) and 31. Assign color 1 to node 35. (Since 16 is 0.)\n\nNode 31 is connected to 35 (color 1) and 4 (from edge 4-31). So node 31's color can't be 1. Assign 0. But wait, node 31 is connected to 35 (color 1) and 4. Let's come back to node 31 later.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 16 (0), and also 28, 33 (edges 9-28, 9-33). Assign color 1 to node 9.\n\nNode 23: connected to 16 (0) and 10 (from edge 10-23), and 16-23. Assign color 1 to node 23.\n\nNode 4: connected to 16 (0), 12, 19, 31 (edge 4-31). Assign color 1 to node 4.\n\nNode 8: connected to 16 (0). Assign color 1.\n\nNow, node 16 is color 0, and its neighbors are assigned 1, except for other nodes not yet colored.\n\nMoving on. Let's process node 22's neighbors: 28 and 36.\n\nNode 28: connected to 22 (color 2), 9 (color 1), and 29 (edge 28-29). So node 28 can't be 2 or 1. So color 0.\n\nBut wait, node 28 is connected to 9 (color 1) and 22 (color 2). So available colors: 0. Assign 0.\n\nThen node 28's color is 0.\n\nNode 36: connected to 22 (color 2), 26, 5 (edge 26-36, 5-36). Assign color to node 36. It can't be 2. Let's assign color 0.\n\nSo node 36: color 0.\n\nNow, node 26 is connected to 36 (0) and 3 (edge 3-26). So node 26 can't be 0. Assign color 1.\n\nNode 3 is connected to 34, 21, 33, 26 (color 1) (edges 3-34, 3-21, 3-33, 3-26). So node 3's color can't be the same as 26 (1). Let's assign color 0. But check other neighbors.\n\nWait, node 3 is connected to 34, 21, 33, and 26.\n\nIf node 26 is color 1, then node 3 can be 0, 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nNode 34: connected to 3 (0), 21 (from edge 21-34). So node 34 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 21: connected to 25, 34 (1), 5, 39 (edges 21-25, 21-34, 5-21, 21-39). Also connected to 3 (0). So node 21's color can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\nNode 25: connected to 21 (2), 11 (1), 6 (edge 11-25, 6-25). So node 25 can't be 2 or 1. Assign 0.\n\nNode 6: connected to 25 (0). Assign color 1.\n\nNode 5: connected to 19, 21 (2), 33, 36 (0) (edges 5-19, 5-21, 5-33, 5-36). So node 5's color can't be 2 or 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 19: connected to 5 (1), 7, 4 (1), 2 (edges 5-19, 7-19, 4-19, 2-19). So node 19 can't be 1. Assign 0. But also check other neighbors: 7 and 4.\n\nNode 7: connected to 19 (0) and 37 (edge 7-37). Assign color 1.\n\nNode 37: connected to 7 (1). Assign 0.\n\nNode 2: connected to 19 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode 4: already assigned color 1. Its edges: 12, 16 (0), 19 (0), 31 (from edge 4-31). So node 4's color is 1. Neighbors 12: color to be determined.\n\nNode 12: connected to 4 (1). Assign 0.\n\nNode 31: connected to 35 (1) and 4 (1). So node 31's color can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\nNode 35: connected to 16 (0), 31 (0). Wait, node 35's color was assigned 1. But node 31 is color 0. So node 35 (color 1) is okay.\n\nMoving to node 17: connected to 18 (edge 17-18). Assign color 0 to node 17.\n\nNode 18: connected to 17 (0) and 32 (edge 18-32). Assign color 1.\n\nNode 32: connected to 18 (1). Assign 0.\n\nNode 14: connected to 39 (edge 14-39). Assign color 0.\n\nNode 39: connected to 21 (2), 27 (edge 27-39), 14 (0), and 5 (assuming 5's color is 1). So node 39's color can't be 2 or 0. Assign 1. But wait, 5's connection to 39 is via 5-21-39? No, edge 21-39 connects 21 and 39. So node 39 is connected to 21 (2), 27, 14 (0). So 39 can't be 2 or 0. So assign 1.\n\nNode 27: connected to 39 (1). Assign 0.\n\nNode 14: color 0. So okay.\n\nNode 10: connected to 23 (1), 29, 13 (edges 10-23, 10-29, 10-13). Assign color 0 (since 23 is 1). But need to check other neighbors.\n\nNode 23: color 1. So node 10 can be 0, 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nNode 29: connected to 28 (0) and 10 (0). So node 29 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 13: connected to 10 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode 8: color 1 (from earlier assignment). Its neighbors: 16 (0). So okay.\n\nNode 33: connected to 15, 3 (0), 9 (1), and 5 (1) (edges 15-33, 3-33, 9-33, 5-33). So node 33's color can't be 0, 1. Assign 2.\n\nNode 15: connected to 33 (2). Assign 0.\n\nNode 34: color 1 (from earlier). Its neighbors: 3 (0), 21 (2). Okay.\n\nNode 24: not connected to any edges. Assign color 0.\n\nNode 1: isolated. Assign color 0.\n\nNode 20: isolated. Assign color 0.\n\nNode 24: Assign color 0 (but wait, node 24 was mentioned as part of nodes 0-39. But in the edges, there's no mention of node 24. So it's isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNode 38: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNow, check for all nodes. Let's list all nodes and their colors as assigned so far:\n\n0:0\n\n1:0\n\n2:1\n\n3:0\n\n4:1\n\n5:1\n\n6:1\n\n7:1\n\n8:1\n\n9:1\n\n10:0\n\n11:1\n\n12:0\n\n13:1\n\n14:0\n\n15:0\n\n16:0\n\n17:0\n\n18:1\n\n19:0\n\n20:0\n\n21:2\n\n22:2\n\n23:1\n\n24:0\n\n25:0\n\n26:1\n\n27:0\n\n28:0\n\n29:1\n\n30:1\n\n31:0\n\n32:0\n\n33:2\n\n34:1\n\n35:1\n\n36:0\n\n37:0\n\n38:0\n\n39:1\n\nNow, need to check for any conflicts. Let's verify each edge.\n\n0-30: 0 and 30 (1) → okay.\n\n16-35: 16 (0) and 35 (1) → okay.\n\n15-33:15 (0) and 33 (2) → okay.\n\n4-12:4 (1) and 12 (0) → okay.\n\n26-36:26 (1) and 36 (0) → okay.\n\n21-25:21 (2) and 25 (0) → okay.\n\n18-32:18 (1) and 32 (0) → okay.\n\n31-35:31 (0) and 35 (1) → okay.\n\n21-34:21 (2) and 34 (1) → okay.\n\n5-19:5 (1) and 19 (0) → okay.\n\n17-18:17 (0) and 18 (1) → okay.\n\n0-11:0 (0) and 11 (1) → okay.\n\n3-34:3 (0) and 34 (1) → okay.\n\n7-19:7 (1) and 19 (0) → okay.\n\n7-37:7 (1) and 37 (0) → okay.\n\n3-21:3 (0) and 21 (2) → okay.\n\n22-28:22 (2) and 28 (0) → okay.\n\n9-16:9 (1) and 16 (0) → okay.\n\n5-21:5 (1) and 21 (2) → okay.\n\n21-39:21 (2) and 39 (1) → okay.\n\n11-16:11 (1) and 16 (0) → okay.\n\n3-33:3 (0) and 33 (2) → okay.\n\n9-28:9 (1) and 28 (0) → okay.\n\n5-33:5 (1) and 33 (2) → okay.\n\n28-29:28 (0) and 29 (1) → okay.\n\n27-39:27 (0) and 39 (1) → okay.\n\n14-39:14 (0) and 39 (1) → okay.\n\n5-36:5 (1) and 36 (0) → okay.\n\n2-19:2 (1) and 19 (0) → okay.\n\n0-22:0 (0) and 22 (2) → okay.\n\n11-25:11 (1) and 25 (0) → okay.\n\n10-23:10 (0) and 23 (1) → okay.\n\n10-29:10 (0) and 29 (1) → okay.\n\n6-25:6 (1) and 25 (0) → okay.\n\n4-16:4 (1) and 16 (0) → okay.\n\n4-19:4 (1) and 19 (0) → okay.\n\n22-30:22 (2) and 30 (1) → okay.\n\n3-26:3 (0) and 26 (1) → okay.\n\n8-16:8 (1) and 16 (0) → okay.\n\n10-13:10 (0) and 13 (1) → okay.\n\n4-31:4 (1) and 31 (0) → okay.\n\n22-36:22 (2) and 36 (0) → okay.\n\n9-33:9 (1) and 33 (2) → okay.\n\n16-23:16 (0) and 23 (1) → okay.\n\nNow, checking the isolated nodes:\n\nNode 1: color 0. No edges. Ok.\n\nNodes 20, 24, 38: all color 0. Ok.\n\nBut wait, nodes 20 and 24: no edges, so their color is fine.\n\nAlso, node 38: color 0. Ok.\n\nNow, check if any color is missing. The colors used are 0, 1, 2.\n\nIn the assignments, nodes 21, 22, 33 are colored 2. Other nodes use 0 and 1. So all three colors are used. Therefore, this should be a valid 3-coloring.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0,0],[1,0],[2,1],[3,0],[4,1],[5,1],[6,1],[7,1],[8,1],[9,1],[10,0],[11,1],[12,0],[13,1],[14,0],[15,0],[16,0],[17,0],[18,1],[19,0],[20,0],[21,2],[22,2],[23,1],[24,0],[25,0],[26,1],[27,0],[28,0],[29,1],[30,1],[31,0],[32,0],[33,2],[34,1],[35,1],[36,0],[37,0],[38,0],[39,1]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

The goal is to assign each of the 17 nodes a color from 0, 1, or 2 such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. Let me start by understanding the structure of the graph based on the given edges.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges provided. Let me parse them one by one:\n\nEdges:\n4-6, 4-12, 5-7, 3-13, 5-16, 8-12, 2-11, 2-8, 13-14, 4-5, 5-6, 5-12, 2-7, 0-13, 4-7, 4-10, 0-9, 8-16, 1-13, 11-15, 7-14.\n\nLooking at these edges, I can see that certain nodes are more connected, which might be key points. For example, node 4 is connected to 6, 12, 5, 7, 10. Node 5 is connected to 7, 16, 6, 12, 4. Node 2 is connected to 11, 8, 7. Nodes 13 is connected to 3, 14, 0, 1. Node 8 is connected to 12, 16, 2. Node 7 is connected to 5, 14, 4, 2. \n\nI should probably start by assigning colors to the most connected nodes first, as they have more constraints. Let's list the degrees of each node to find the highest degree nodes.\n\nCalculating degrees:\n- Node 4: connected to 6,12,5,7,10 → degree 5\n- Node 5: connected to 7,16,6,12,4 → degree 5\n- Node 2: connected to 11,8,7 → degree 3\n- Node 7: connected to 5,14,4,2 → degree 4\n- Node 13: connected to 3,14,0,1 → degree 4\n- Node 8: connected to 12,16,2 → degree 3\n- Node 12: connected to 4,8,5 → degree 3\n- Node 14: connected to 13,7 → degree 2\n- Node 6: connected to 4,5 → degree 2\n- Node 16: connected to 5,8 → degree 2\n- Node 0: connected to 13,9 → degree 2\n- Node 1: connected to 13 → degree 1\n- Node 3: connected to 13 → degree 1\n- Node 9: connected to 0 → degree 1\n- Node 10: connected to 4 → degree 1\n- Node 11: connected to 2,15 → degree 2\n- Node 15: connected to 11 → degree 1\n\nSo the highest degree nodes are 4 and 5, each with degree 5. Let's start with node 4. Assign color 0 to node 4. Then, all adjacent nodes (6,12,5,7,10) cannot be color 0.\n\nNext, node 5. Since node 5 is adjacent to node 4 (color 0), it can't be 0. Assign color 1 to node 5. Now, node 5's adjacent nodes (7,16,6,12,4) can't be 1. But wait, node 4 is already 0, so that's okay. Now, node 7 is connected to both 4 and 5. So node 7 can't be 0 (from 4) or 1 (from 5). So node 7 must be color 2.\n\nMoving on to node 7's adjacent nodes. Node 7 is connected to 5 (1), 14, 4 (0), and 2. So 14 and 2 can't be 2. Also, node 2 is connected to 7 (color 2), so node 2 can't be 2. Let's assign color to node 2. Since node 2 is connected to 7 (2), 11, 8. Let's choose color 0 for node 2. But wait, node 2's other adjacent nodes (11,8) need to not conflict. Let's check later.\n\nNow, node 2 is color 0. Then, nodes 11,8 can't be 0. Let's handle node 8. Node 8 is connected to 12,16,2 (color 0). So node 8 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Then, nodes 12 and 16 adjacent to 8 can't be 1. Node 12 is connected to 4 (0), 5 (1), and 8 (1). So node 12 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2. Now, node 12 is color 2. Check if that's allowed. Yes, since adjacent to 4 (0), 5 (1), 8 (1). So 2 is okay.\n\nNode 16 is connected to 5 (1) and 8 (1). So node 16 can't be 1. Assign color 0. Because adjacent to 5 (1) and 8 (1). So color 0 is allowed.\n\nBack to node 5's connections. Node 6 is connected to 4 (0) and 5 (1). So node 6 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2. Node 6's color is 2.\n\nNode 10 is connected only to 4 (0). So node 10 can be color 1 or 2. Let's assign 1 for simplicity.\n\nNow, node 7 is color 2. Its adjacent nodes: 14. So node 14 can't be 2. Node 14 is connected to 13 as well. Let's check node 13. Node 13 is connected to 3,14,0,1. Let's see. Assigning color to 13 first. Let's look at node 13's edges. Connected to 3,14,0,1. Let's choose color for node 13. What's available? Let's see. Let's process node 0. Node 0 is connected to 13 and 9. Let's assign node 0 first. Since node 0 is connected to 13, which we haven't colored yet. Let's pick a color for 0. Suppose we assign color 1 to node 0. Then, node 9 (adjacent to 0) can't be 1. Node 13, connected to 0 (1), so node 13 can't be 1. Then, what colors are left for node 13? Let's see. If node 0 is 1, then 13 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0 for node 13. Then, node 13's adjacent nodes (3,14,1) can't be 0. Node 14 is connected to 13 (0) and 7 (2). So node 14 can't be 0 or 2. Assign color 1. That works. Now, node 14 is 1. \n\nNode 1 is connected to 13 (0). So node 1 can be 1 or 2. Assign 1 to node 1. Then, node 1's adjacent nodes (none except 13) are okay. \n\nNode 3 is connected to 13 (0). Assign color 1. \n\nNow, node 9 is connected to 0 (1). Assign color 0. \n\nNow, node 15 is connected to 11. Let's handle node 11. Node 11 is connected to 2 (0) and 15. Since node 2 is 0, node 11 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Then node 15 can't be 1. Assign 0. \n\nLet's check all nodes:\n\n0: 1\n1:1 (but wait, node 1 is connected to 13 (0), so color 1 is okay)\n2:0\n3:1\n4:0\n5:1\n6:2\n7:2\n8:1\n9:0\n10:1\n11:1 (adjacent to 2 (0), okay)\n12:2\n13:0\n14:1\n15:0 (adjacent to 11 (1), okay)\n16:0\n\nNow, let's check all edges for conflicts:\n\nCheck edges:\n\n4-6: 0 vs 2 ✔️\n4-12:0 vs2 ✔️\n4-5:0 vs1 ✔️\n4-7:0 vs2 ✔️\n4-10:0 vs1 ✔️\n5-7:1 vs2 ✔️\n5-6:1 vs2 ✔️\n5-12:1 vs2 ✔️\n5-16:1 vs0 ✔️\n7-14:2 vs1 ✔️\n7-2:2 vs0 ✔️\n2-8:0 vs1 ✔️\n2-11:0 vs1 ✔️\n8-12:1 vs2 ✔️\n8-16:1 vs0 ✔️\n13-14:0 vs1 ✔️\n13-0:0 vs1 ✔️\n13-3:0 vs1 ✔️\n13-1:0 vs1 ✔️\n0-9:1 vs0 ✔️\n11-15:1 vs0 ✔️\n3-13:1 vs0 ✔️\n\nOthers:\n\nNode 1: connected to 13 (0) → color 1 is okay.\nNode 10: connected to 4 (0) → color1 is okay.\nNode 16: connected to5 (1) and8 (1) → color0 is okay.\nNode 6: connected to4 (0) and5 (1) → color2 ✔️\nNode 9: connected to0 (1) → color0 ✔️\nNode 15: connected to11 (1) → color0 ✔️\nNode 3: connected to13 (0) → color1 ✔️\n\nLooks like all edges are satisfied. Now, let's check if all nodes are assigned. The nodes are 0-16.\n\nWait, node 10's color is 1. Yes. Node 10 is only connected to 4 (0), so 1 is okay.\n\nAll nodes have colors. The colors used are 0,1,2. The count is correct. So the coloring should be valid.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0,1],[1,1],[2,0],[3,1],[4,0],[5,1],[6,2],[7,2],[8,1],[9,0],[10,1],[11,1],[12,2],[13,0],[14,1],[15,0],[16,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the graph. There are 45 nodes (from 0 to 44) and a bunch of edges listed. My goal is to assign each node a color (0, 1, or 2) such that no two connected nodes have the same color.\n\nFirst, maybe I should list out all the edges and see if there are any patterns or clusters. But that's a lot of edges. Alternatively, I can approach this by building the adjacency list for each node so I can track which nodes are connected.\n\nLet me start by creating an adjacency list. Each node will have a list of nodes it's connected to. That way, when I assign a color to a node, I can check the colors of its adjacent nodes and choose a different one.\n\nStarting with the edges provided:\n\n33-36, 26-30, 26-27, 18-29, 6-39, 18-38, 12-28, 40-44, 39-42, 14-22, 12-34, 22-38, 9-20, 5-31, 17-42, 27-43, 0-18, 22-25, 0-1, 9-16, 4-35, 10-14, 8-23, 37-41, 8-35, 28-41, 1-26, 19-41, 25-30, 26-34, 26-40, 13-43, 21-38, 17-19, 14-32, 2-3, 5-32, 21-44, 2-6, 10-25, 9-27, 9-33, 25-26, 27-41.\n\nLet me build the adjacency list step by step. For each edge, add both directions since it's an undirected graph.\n\nFor example, 33-36 means 33's neighbors include 36, and 36's neighbors include 33.\n\nHmm, this could take some time. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for nodes with high degrees, as they might be more constrained. Let's see.\n\nLooking through the edges, node 26 is connected to 30, 27, 1, 34, 40, 25, etc. Let's check how many connections each node has.\n\nNode 26 appears in edges: 26-30, 26-27, 1-26, 25-26, 26-34, 26-40. That's 6 edges, so degree 6. Similarly, node 9 has edges 9-20, 9-16, 9-27, 9-33. So degree 4. Node 25 has edges 22-25, 10-25, 25-26, 25-30. Degree 4. Node 27 is connected to 26, 9, 43, 41. Degree 4. Node 14 is connected to 22, 10, 32. Degree 3. Node 18 is connected to 29, 38, 0. Degree 3. Node 38 is connected to 18, 22, 21. Degree 3. Node 41 is connected to 37, 28, 19, 27. Degree 4. Hmm. So nodes 26, 41, 25, 27, 9, etc., have higher degrees.\n\nHigh-degree nodes can be colored first because they have more constraints. So maybe start with node 26. Assign it color 0. Then its adjacent nodes (30, 27, 1, 34, 40, 25) can't be 0. Then proceed to each of those nodes and assign colors different from their neighbors.\n\nBut this approach could lead to backtracking. Since we need to use exactly 3 colors, perhaps a greedy algorithm approach where we process nodes in order of descending degree and assign the smallest available color not used by neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a graph coloring algorithm like backtracking with some heuristics, but since the problem is to find any valid 3-coloring, maybe a systematic approach is better.\n\nLet me try to process the nodes in order from highest degree to lowest. Let's list out all nodes and their degrees.\n\nFirst, I need to count the degree for each node. Let's go through the edges again and tally.\n\nFor each node, count how many times they appear in the edges.\n\nList of edges:\n\n33-36 → 33, 36\n26-30 → 26,30\n26-27 →26,27\n18-29 →18,29\n6-39 →6,39\n18-38 →18,38\n12-28 →12,28\n40-44 →40,44\n39-42 →39,42\n14-22 →14,22\n12-34 →12,34\n22-38 →22,38\n9-20 →9,20\n5-31 →5,31\n17-42 →17,42\n27-43 →27,43\n0-18 →0,18\n22-25 →22,25\n0-1 →0,1\n9-16 →9,16\n4-35 →4,35\n10-14 →10,14\n8-23 →8,23\n37-41 →37,41\n8-35 →8,35\n28-41 →28,41\n1-26 →1,26\n19-41 →19,41\n25-30 →25,30\n26-34 →26,34\n26-40 →26,40\n13-43 →13,43\n21-38 →21,38\n17-19 →17,19\n14-32 →14,32\n2-3 →2,3\n5-32 →5,32\n21-44 →21,44\n2-6 →2,6\n10-25 →10,25\n9-27 →9,27\n9-33 →9,33\n25-26 →25,26\n27-41 →27,41\n\nNow, let's count each node's occurrences:\n\n0: edges 0-18, 0-1 → degree 2\n1: 0-1, 1-26 → degree 2\n2: 2-3, 2-6 → degree 2\n3: 2-3 → degree 1\n4: 4-35 → degree 1\n5:5-31,5-32 → degree 2\n6:6-39,2-6 → degree 2\n7: (not listed) → degree 0\n8:8-23,8-35 → degree 2\n9:9-20,9-16,9-27,9-33 → degree 4\n10:10-14,10-25 → degree 2\n11: (not listed) → degree 0\n12:12-28,12-34 → degree 2\n13:13-43 → degree 1\n14:14-22,10-14,14-32 → degree 3\n15: (not listed) → degree 0\n16:9-16 → degree 1\n17:17-42,17-19 → degree 2\n18:18-29,18-38,0-18 → degree 3\n19:19-41,17-19 → degree 2\n20:9-20 → degree 1\n21:21-38,21-44 → degree 2\n22:14-22,22-38,22-25 → degree 3\n23:8-23 → degree 1\n24: (not listed) → degree 0\n25:22-25,10-25,25-30,25-26 → degree 4\n26:26-30,26-27,1-26,25-26,26-34,26-40 → degree 6\n27:26-27,9-27,27-43,27-41 → degree 4\n28:12-28,28-41 → degree 2\n29:18-29 → degree 1\n30:26-30,25-30 → degree 2\n31:5-31 → degree 1\n32:14-32,5-32 → degree 2\n33:9-33,33-36 → degree 2\n34:12-34,26-34 → degree 2\n35:4-35,8-35 → degree 2\n36:33-36 → degree 1\n37:37-41 → degree 1\n38:18-38,22-38,21-38 → degree 3\n39:6-39,39-42 → degree 2\n40:26-40,40-44 → degree 2\n41:37-41,28-41,19-41,27-41 → degree 4\n42:39-42,17-42 → degree 2\n43:27-43,13-43 → degree 2\n44:40-44,21-44 → degree 2\n\nSo the nodes with the highest degrees are:\n\n26 (degree 6)\n25 (4), 27 (4), 9 (4), 41 (4)\n14 (3), 18 (3), 22 (3), 38 (3)\nOthers have lower degrees.\n\nSo starting with node 26. Let's assign color 0.\n\nThen its adjacent nodes (30, 27, 1, 34, 40, 25) cannot be 0.\n\nNext, process node 25 (degree 4). Its neighbors are 22,10,26,30. Node 26 is color 0, so 25 can't be 0. Assign the next available color, say 1.\n\nThen node 27 (degree 4). Connected to 26 (0), 9,43,41. So can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nBut wait, node 27's neighbor 26 is 0, so 27 can be 1. Then check other neighbors.\n\nBut node 27 is also connected to 9 and 41. Let's check those. 9 and 41 haven't been colored yet. So for now, assign 1 to 27. Then when we color 9 and 41, need to ensure they are not 1 if connected to 27.\n\nNext, node 9 (degree 4). Its neighbors are 20,16,27,33. 27 is 1, so 9 can't be 1. Assign 0. Then 20,16,33 must not be 0.\n\nNode 41 (degree 4). Neighbors are 37,28,19,27. 27 is 1, so 41 can't be 1. Assign 0. Then 37,28,19 can't be 0.\n\nThen node 14 (degree 3). Neighbors: 22,10,32. Let's see. Assign color 0? Wait, but 14's neighbors may not have been colored yet. Let's check. 22 is connected to 14. If 14 is color 0, then 22 can't be 0. Assign 0 to 14.\n\nNode 22: neighbors 14 (0),38,25 (1). So 22 can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\nNode 38: neighbors 18,22 (2),21. So 38 can't be 2. Assign 0. Then check its neighbors. 18,22,21.\n\nNode 18: neighbors 29,38 (0),0. So 18 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nWait, node 0 is connected to 18 (1), so 0 can't be 1. Let's process node 0. It's connected to 18 (1) and 1. Assign color 0 if possible. If 0's neighbors are 18 (1) and 1 (unknown yet). Let's assign 0 to node 0. Then node 1 can't be 0. But node 1 is connected to 0 (0) and 26 (0). Wait, node 1 is connected to 26 (color 0) and 0 (color 0). So node 1 can't be 0. Assign color 1.\n\nProceeding step by step may take a while, but let's try to track each node's color.\n\nLet me try to list the nodes in order of descending degree and assign colors:\n\n1. Node 26 → color 0\nAdjacent nodes: 30,27,1,34,40,25 (all can't be 0)\n\n2. Node 25 → neighbors are 22,10,26 (0),30 → can't be 0. Assign color 1\nAdjacent to 22,10,26 (0),30. So 25 is 1.\n\n3. Node 27 → neighbors 26 (0),9,43,41 → can't be 0. Assign 1\nBut 9 and 41 are yet to be colored. So 27 is 1.\n\n4. Node 9 → neighbors 20,16,27 (1),33 → can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\n5. Node 41 → neighbors 37,28,19,27 (1) → can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\n6. Node 14 → neighbors 22,10,32. Assign 0 (since none of these neighbors are colored yet. So 14 is 0, neighbors can't be 0.\n\n7. Node 22 → neighbors 14 (0),38,25 (1). Can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\n8. Node 38 → neighbors 18,22 (2),21. Can't be 2. Assign 0. Then 18,21 can't be 0.\n\n9. Node 18 → neighbors 29,38 (0),0 → can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\n10. Node 0 → connected to 18 (1) and 1. Assign 0 (since 18 is 1). Now node 1 is connected to 0 (0) and 26 (0), so can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nSo node 1 → color 1.\n\nNow proceed to other nodes.\n\n11. Node 30 → connected to 26 (0) and 25 (1). Can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\n12. Node 34 → connected to 12 and 26 (0). Assign 1.\n\n13. Node 40 → connected to 26 (0) and 44. Assign 1.\n\n14. Node 40's neighbor 44 → can't be 1 (if 40 is 1). Assign 0 or 2.\n\n15. Node 27's neighbors: 43 and 41 (0). 27 is 1. So 43 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 43 later.\n\n16. Node 9's neighbors: 20 (not colored), 16 (not colored), 33 (not colored). So 20 and 16 can't be 0. Assign colors accordingly when processed.\n\n17. Node 41's neighbors: 37,28,19. 41 is 0. So 37,28,19 can't be 0.\n\n18. Node 37 → connected to 41 (0). Assign 1.\n\n19. Node 28 → connected to 12 and 41 (0). Assign 1.\n\n20. Node 19 → connected to 17 and 41 (0). Assign 1.\n\n21. Node 17 → connected to 42 and 19 (1). Assign 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\n22. Node 42 → connected to 39 and 17 (0). Assign 1.\n\n23. Node 39 → connected to 6 and 42 (1). Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\n24. Node 6 → connected to 39 (0) and 2. Assign 1.\n\n25. Node 2 → connected to 3 and 6 (1). Assign 0.\n\n26. Node 3 → connected to 2 (0). Assign 1.\n\n27. Node 5 → connected to 31 and 32. Assign 0.\n\n28. Node 31 → connected to 5 (0). Assign 1.\n\n29. Node 32 → connected to 14 (0) and 5 (0). Assign 1 or 2. Let's assign 1.\n\n30. Node 10 → connected to 14 (0) and 25 (1). Can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\n31. Node 8 → connected to 23 and 35. Assign 0.\n\n32. Node 23 → connected to 8 (0). Assign 1.\n\n33. Node 35 → connected to 4 and 8 (0). Assign 1.\n\n34. Node 4 → connected to 35 (1). Assign 0.\n\n35. Node 12 → connected to 28 (1) and 34 (1). Assign 0.\n\n36. Node 34 → already assigned 1. So node 12's color is 0.\n\n37. Node 43 → connected to 27 (1) and 13. Assign 0.\n\n38. Node 13 → connected to 43 (0). Assign 1.\n\n39. Node 21 → connected to 38 (0) and 44. Assign 1.\n\n40. Node 44 → connected to 40 (1) and 21 (1). Assign 0 or 2. Since 40 is 1, 44 can be 0 or 2. But 21 is 1, so 44 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\n41. Node 40 → already assigned 1. So 44 is 0.\n\n42. Node 7, 11, 15, 24, etc. (nodes with no edges). Assign any color, say 0.\n\nSo compiling all nodes:\n\n0: 0\n1:1\n2:0\n3:1\n4:0\n5:0\n6:1\n7:0\n8:0\n9:0\n10:2\n11:0\n12:0\n13:1\n14:0\n15:0\n16: (connected to 9 which is 0. Assign 1)\n17:0\n18:1\n19:1\n20: (connected to 9 which is 0. Assign 1)\n21:1\n22:2\n23:1\n24:0\n25:1\n26:0\n27:1\n28:1\n29: (connected to 18 which is 1. Assign 0)\n30:2\n31:1\n32:1\n33: (connected to 9 which is 0. Assign 1)\n34:1\n35:1\n36: (connected to 33 which is 1.

That's okay. 25's color is 1, neighbors 22 (2), 10 (2), 26 (0), 30 (2). All different. Good.\n\nNode 27 (color 1). Neighbors 26 (0),9 (0),43 (0),41 (0). All different. Wait no. 9 is color 0, so 27 can't be 0. But 27 is color 1. Correct. 41 is 0. So 27's color is 1, which is different from all neighbors. Good.\n\nNode 9 (color 0).

The graph has 44 nodes, and we need to color them using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2). The goal is to assign colors such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. Let's start by understanding the structure of the graph based on the given edges.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges to see which nodes are connected. This will help me identify any cliques or nodes with high degrees that might be tricky. Let's parse the edges:\n\n13-30, 7-20, 10-43, 18-26, 6-30, 25-41, 3-16, 4-21, 6-36, 8-15, 17-27, 1-15, 36-43, 28-42, 16-19, 11-32, 19-39, 33-38, 1-39, 11-41, 11-33, 16-31, 23-27, 22-34, 14-42, 24-32, 19-32, 1-26, 8-41, 30-41, 16-30, 11-43, 35-40, 4-10, 1-41, 18-39, 7-39, 21-32, 4-25, 8-19, 0-33, 5-32, 5-29, 19-31, 17-43. Wait, did I miss some? Let me check again. Oh, the original list is longer. Let me list all correctly.\n\nBut maybe instead of listing all edges, I can note which nodes have multiple connections. For example, node 11 is connected to 32, 41, 33, 43. So node 11 has four edges. Similarly, node 19 is connected to 16, 39, 32, 31, 8, etc. So high-degree nodes like 11, 19, 16, 1, 41, 32, etc., need careful handling.\n\nLet's start by assigning colors to the highest degree nodes first. But how do I determine the degrees? Let's count how many edges each node has.\n\nLooking through the edges:\n\nNode 1 is connected to 15, 39, 26, 41, etc. Let's see:\n\n1 connects to 15, 39, 26, 41. So four edges.\n\nNode 11 connects to 32, 41, 33, 43. Four edges.\n\nNode 19 connects to 16, 39, 32, 31, 8. Five edges? Wait, edges include 16-19, 19-39, 19-32 (from edges like 19-32, 8-19, etc. Wait, the edges listed include 16-19, 19-39, 19-32, 8-19 (8-19: so node 8 connected to 19), 19-31. So node 19 has edges to 16, 39, 32, 8, 31. So that's five edges. So high degree.\n\nSimilarly, node 16 has edges to 3, 19, 30, 31, 37. Let's check edges: 3-16, 16-19, 16-30, 16-31, 16-37. So five edges.\n\nNode 41 is connected to 25, 11, 13, 8, 30, 1, 24. Wait, edges: 25-41, 11-41, 13-41, 8-41, 30-41, 1-41, and perhaps others. Let's count: 25,11,13,8,30,1. So six edges. So node 41 has high degree.\n\nNode 32 connects to 11,24,19,21,5. Let's check edges: 11-32,24-32,19-32,21-32,5-32. Five edges.\n\nSo nodes 41, 19, 16, 32, 11, etc., have high degrees. These are critical because they require more colors to be assigned carefully.\n\nLet's start by assigning colors to node 41 first. Since it's connected to many nodes (25,11,13,8,30,1), each of these adjacent nodes must have different colors from 41. Let's assign color 0 to node 41. Then all its neighbors (25,11,13,8,30,1) can't be 0.\n\nNext, look at node 19. It's connected to 16,39,32,31,8. Let's choose a color for 19. Let's pick color 0. Wait, but if 8 is a neighbor of 19, and if 8 is also a neighbor of 41 (which is color 0), then 8 can't be 0. But 19 is color 0, so 8 can't be 0. But 41 is 0, so 8 can't be 0. So 8 could be 1 or 2. Let's proceed.\n\nWait, maybe starting with the highest-degree nodes first would be better. Let's try to assign colors in a way that conflicting nodes get different colors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a backtracking approach, but since this is manual, let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet's pick node 41. Assign color 0. Then all its neighbors (nodes 25, 11, 13, 8, 30, 1) must not be 0.\n\nNext, node 19. Let's assign it color 1. Then its neighbors (16, 39, 32, 31, 8) can't be 1.\n\nNode 32 has neighbors 11,24,19,21,5. Since node 19 is color 1, node 32 can't be 1. Let's assign 32 color 0. Then its neighbors (11,24,19,21,5) can't be 0. Wait, but node 19 is already color 1, so 32 being 0 is okay. Then 11,24,21,5 can't be 0. But node 11 is connected to 32 (color 0), so 11 can't be 0. But 11 is also connected to 41 (color 0), which already prevents it from being 0. So 11 must be either 1 or 2.\n\nWait, node 11 is connected to 32 (0) and 41 (0), and also 33, 43. Let's see. Node 11's edges: 11-32, 11-41, 11-33, 11-43. So 11 is connected to 32 (0), 41 (0), 33 (unknown), 43 (unknown). So 11 must be a color different from 0. Let's assign 11 to color 1. Then 32 (0), 41 (0) are okay. Then 33 and 43 can't be 1 if they are adjacent to 11.\n\nBut node 33 is connected to 11 (1) and 38, 0. So node 33 can't be 1. Let's assign 33 a color 2. Then node 0 is connected to 33 (2), so node 0 can't be 2. So possible colors for 0 are 0 or 1.\n\nWait, node 0 is connected to 33 (2), so node 0 can be 0 or 1.\n\nBut let's come back. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nSo far:\n\n41: 0\n\n19:1\n\n32:0\n\n11:1\n\n33:2\n\nNow, node 1 is connected to 15, 39, 26, 41 (0). So node 1 can't be 0. Let's assign color 1 to node 1. Then its neighbors (15,39,26) can't be 1.\n\nBut node 1 is connected to 41 (0), so correct.\n\nNode 8 is connected to 15, 41 (0), 19 (1). So node 8 can't be 0 or 1. So it must be 2.\n\nSo 8:2.\n\nThen node 8's neighbors: 15 (can't be 2), 41 (0), 19 (1).\n\nNode 15 is connected to 8 (2) and 1 (1). So 15 can't be 1 or 2. So 15 must be 0.\n\n15:0.\n\nNow, node 1's neighbors: 15 (0), 39, 26, 41 (0). So node 1 is 1. So 39 and 26 can't be 1.\n\nNode 39 is connected to 19 (1), 1 (1), 7, 18. So node 39 can't be 1. Let's assign 39 to 0. But wait, node 19 is 1, so 39 can't be 1. Assigning 39:0.\n\nBut node 39's neighbors: 19 (1), 1 (1), 7, 18. So 39 can be 0, 2. Let's choose 0. Then 7 and 18 can't be 0.\n\nBut node 39 is also connected to nodes like 7 and 18 (from edges 7-39, 18-39). So 7 and 18 can't be 0.\n\nLet's assign node 39:0.\n\nThen node 7, connected to 20, 39 (0), so node 7 can't be 0. Assign 7:1.\n\nSimilarly, node 18 is connected to 26, 39 (0). Assign 18:1.\n\nNow, node 26 is connected to 1 (1) and 18 (1). So node 26 can't be 1. Assign 26:0.\n\nNow, node 26's color is 0. Then node 1's neighbors: 15 (0), 39 (0), 26 (0) — but node 1 is color 1, which is okay.\n\nWait, but node 26 is color 0, and node 1 is color 1. So that's fine.\n\nMoving on. Node 16 is connected to 3, 19 (1), 30, 31, 37. Assign color to 16. 19 is color 1, so 16 can't be 1. Let's assign 16:0. Then its neighbors (3,30,31,37) can't be 0.\n\nBut wait, node 19 is 1, so 16 being 0 is okay. Let's check if 16 is connected to others. Node 3 is connected to 16 (0), so 3 can't be 0. Let's assign 3:1.\n\nNode 3:1.\n\nNow, node 30 is connected to 13,6,36,41 (0),16 (0). So node 30 can't be 0. Assign 30:1. Then its neighbors (13,6,36,41 (0),16 (0)) must not be 1. But 41 is 0, so 30 is 1, which is okay. So 13,6,36 can't be 1.\n\nNode 30:1.\n\nNow, node 13 is connected to 30 (1) and 41 (0). So node 13 can't be 0 or 1. Assign 13:2.\n\nNode 13:2.\n\nThen node 13's neighbors: 30 (1) and 41 (0), okay.\n\nNow, node 6 is connected to 30 (1) and 36. Since 30 is 1, 6 can't be 1. Assign 6:0. Then 36 can't be 0 (since 6-36 is an edge). So node 36, connected to 6 (0) and 43. Assign 36:1.\n\nNode 36:1.\n\nThen node 43 is connected to 10,36 (1),17,11 (1). So node 43 can't be 1. Assign 43:0.\n\nWait, 43's edges: 10-43, 36-43, 17-43, 11-43 (11 is 1). So 43's neighbors are 10, 36 (1), 17, 11 (1). So 43 can't be 1. Assign 43:0. Then 10 can't be 0, 17 can't be 0.\n\nBut node 11 is connected to 43 (0). So 11 is 1, which is okay.\n\nNow, node 10 is connected to 43 (0) and 4. Assign node 10:1. Then 4 can't be 1.\n\nNode 10:1.\n\nNode 4 is connected to 21,10 (1),25. Assign node 4:0. Then 21 and 25 can't be 0.\n\nNode 4:0.\n\nNow, node 25 is connected to 41 (0),4 (0),24. So 25 can't be 0. Assign 25:1. Then 24 can't be 1.\n\nNode 25:1.\n\nNode 24 is connected to 32 (0),25 (1). So 24 can't be 0 or 1. Assign 24:2.\n\nNode 24:2.\n\nNow, node 21 is connected to 4 (0),32 (0). So 21 can't be 0. Assign 21:1. Then node 32 is 0, which is okay.\n\nNode 21:1.\n\nNow, node 32's neighbors: 11 (1),24 (2),19 (1),21 (1),5. Wait, node 32 is 0. So 5 can't be 0. Assign node 5's color. Node 5 is connected to 32 (0) and 29. Assign 5:1. Then 29 can't be 1.\n\nNode 5:1.\n\nNode 29: connected to 5 (1). Assign 29:0 or 2. Let's choose 0.\n\nNode 29:0.\n\nNow, node 17 is connected to 27,43 (0). So 17 can't be 0. Assign 17:1.\n\nNode 17:1.\n\nNode 27 is connected to 17 (1),23. Assign 27:0.\n\nNode 27:0.\n\nNode 23 is connected to 27 (0). Assign 23:1.\n\nNode 23:1.\n\nNode 22 is connected to 34. Assign 22:0 (since it's only edge, any color is okay). Then node 34 can't be 0. Assign 34:1.\n\nNode 22:0, 34:1.\n\nNode 14 is connected to 42. Assign 14:0. Then 42 can't be 0.\n\nNode 14:0.\n\nNode 28 is connected to 42. Assign 28:0. Then 42 can't be 0. Assign 42:1.\n\nNodes 28:0, 42:1.\n\nNode 35 is connected to 40. Assign 35:0. Node 40: can be 1.\n\nNode 35:0, 40:1.\n\nNode 7 is connected to 20,39 (0). Assign 7:1 (as before). Node 20 can't be 1. Assign 20:0.\n\nNode 7:1, 20:0.\n\nNode 8 is 2, as assigned earlier. Node 8's neighbors: 15 (0), 41 (0), 19 (1). So okay.\n\nNode 31 is connected to 16 (0),19 (1). Assign 31:2. Because 16 is 0 and 19 is 1, so 31 can't be 0 or 1. So 31:2.\n\nNode 31:2.\n\nNode 37 is connected to 16 (0). Assign 37:1.\n\nNode 37:1.\n\nNode 38 is connected to 33 (2). Assign 38:0.\n\nNode 38:0.\n\nNode 0 is connected to 33 (2). Assign 0:0 (since it's allowed, as 33 is 2). But node 0 can be 0 or 1. Let's check if any conflicts. For example, node 0's color is 0. Are there any other edges involving node 0? The edges listed: 0-33. So no other edges. So 0:0 is okay.\n\nNode 0:0.\n\nNow, let's check remaining nodes:\n\nNode 2: Not mentioned in any edges. So it's an isolated node. Assign color 0.\n\nNode 2:0.\n\nNode 9: Not listed in edges. Assign 0.\n\nNode 9:0.\n\nNode 12: No edges. Assign 0.\n\nNode 12:0.\n\nNode 34 is already handled (assigned 1).\n\nNode 40: connected to 35 (0). Assign 40:1.\n\nNode 40:1.\n\nWait, node 40 is assigned 1.\n\nNow, let's check all nodes from 0 to 43 to ensure none are missed.\n\nNodes 0-43: Let's list each and see.\n\n0:0\n\n1:1\n\n2:0\n\n3:1\n\n4:0\n\n5:1\n\n6:0\n\n7:1\n\n8:2\n\n9:0\n\n10:1\n\n11:1\n\n12:0\n\n13:2\n\n14:0\n\n15:0\n\n16:0\n\n17:1\n\n18:1\n\n19:1\n\n20:0\n\n21:1\n\n22:0\n\n23:1\n\n24:2\n\n25:1\n\n26:0\n\n27:0\n\n28:0\n\n29:0\n\n30:1\n\n31:2\n\n32:0\n\n33:2\n\n34:1\n\n35:0\n\n36:1\n\n37:1\n\n38:0\n\n39:0\n\n40:1\n\n41:0\n\n42:1\n\n43:0\n\nWait, node 19 was assigned color 1, but earlier I thought of assigning 1 to node 19. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, node 19's edges: 16-19 (16 is 0), 19-39 (39 is 0), 19-32 (32 is 0), 19-31 (31 is 2), 8-19 (8 is 2). So node 19's color is 1. All adjacent nodes: 16 (0), 39 (0), 32 (0), 31 (2), 8 (2). So 1 is different from all. That's okay.\n\nBut node 8 is 2, which is allowed.\n\nWait, node 19's color is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother check: node 16 (0) is connected to 3 (1),19 (1),30 (1),31 (2),37 (1). So node 16's color is 0, which is different from all neighbors. Good.\n\nNode 32 (0) has neighbors 11 (1),24 (2),19 (1),21 (1),5 (1). So 0 is okay.\n\nNode 41 (0) has neighbors 25 (1),11 (1),13 (2),8 (2),30 (1),1 (1). All different from 0. Good.\n\nNow, let's check for any possible conflicts.\n\nCheck node 1: color 1. Neighbors 15 (0),39 (0),26 (0),41 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 11: color 1. Neighbors 32 (0),41 (0),33 (2),43 (0). So 1 is okay.\n\nNode 33: color 2. Neighbors 11 (1),38 (0),0 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 8: color 2. Neighbors 15 (0),41 (0),19 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 6: color 0. Neighbors 30 (1),36 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 36: color 1. Neighbors 6 (0),43 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 43: color 0. Neighbors 10 (1),36 (1),17 (1),11 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 5: color 1. Neighbors 32 (0),29 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 21: color 1. Neighbors 4 (0),32 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 4: color 0. Neighbors 21 (1),10 (1),25 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 25: color 1. Neighbors 41 (0),4 (0),24 (2). Correct.\n\nNode 24: color 2. Neighbors 32 (0),25 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 13: color 2. Neighbors 30 (1),41 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 30: color 1. Neighbors 13 (2),6 (0),36 (1),41 (0),16 (0). Wait, node 30 is color 1. Its neighbor 36 is color 1. Oh, that's a problem! Because 30 and 36 are connected via edge 30-36? Wait, let me check the edges. The edges list includes 6-36, 36-43, but I don't see a 30-36 edge. Wait, original edges list:\n\nLooking back at the edges:\n\nOriginal edges include \"6 - 36\", \"36 - 43\", \"16 - 30\", \"30 -41\", etc. Wait, there's no edge between 30 and 36. So node 30's neighbors are 13, 6, 41, 16, etc. Wait, the edges for node 30 are:\n\n13-30, 6-30, 30-41, 16-30. So node 30 is connected to 13,6,41,16. So node 30's color is 1. Its neighbors: 13 (2),6 (0),41 (0),16 (0). So 1 is okay.\n\nBut earlier when assigning node 30, we thought about 36-30, but there's no such edge. So 30 and 36 are not connected. So node 36 is connected to 6 and 43. So node 30's color is 1, node 36 is 1. No edge between them, so that's okay.\n\nAnother check: node 17 is color 1. Connected to 27 (0) and 43 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 23 is 1. Connected to 27 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 34 is 1. Connected to 22 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 35 is 0. Connected to 40 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 38 is 0. Connected to 33 (2). Correct.\n\nNode 31 is 2. Connected to 16 (0) and 19 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 37 is 1. Connected to 16 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 2 is 0. No edges. Correct.\n\nNode 9:0. Correct.\n\nNode 12:0. Correct.\n\nNode 20:0. Connected to 7 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 22:0. Correct.\n\nNode 28:0. Correct.\n\nNode 29:0. Correct.\n\nNode 40:1. Correct.\n\nNow, the only node not mentioned yet is node 34 (handled), 3, 7, etc. All seem okay.\n\nWait, node 3 is connected to 16 (0). So node 3 is 1. Correct.\n\nNode 7:1, connected to 20 (0) and 39 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 18:1, connected to 26 (0) and 39 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 26:0, connected to 1 (1) and 18 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 39:0, connected to 1 (1), 19 (1),7 (1),18 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 40:1, connected to 35 (0). Correct.\n\nAll other nodes (like 2,9,12, etc.) are isolated and assigned 0.\n\nSo this coloring uses 3 colors (0,1,2). Now, let's check if all edges are satisfied.\n\nFor example:\n\nEdge 17-43: 17 is 1, 43 is 0. Correct.\n\nEdge 35-40: 35 is 0, 40 is 1. Correct.\n\nEdge 4-10:4 is 0,10 is 1. Correct.\n\nEdge 0-33:0 is 0,33 is 2. Correct.\n\nEdge 5-29:5 is 1,29 is 0. Correct.\n\nEdge 19-31:19 is 1,31 is 2. Correct.\n\nEdge 16-30:16 is 0,30 is 1. Correct.\n\nEdge 11-41:11 is1,41 is0. Correct.\n\nEdge 1-41:1 is1,41 is0. Correct.\n\nEdge 8-19:8 is2,19 is1. Correct.\n\nEdge 25-41:25 is1,41 is0. Correct.\n\nEdge 32-21:32 is0,21 is1. Correct.\n\nEdge 19-32:19 is1,32 is0. Correct.\n\nAll seem to be correct. So this should be a valid 3-coloring.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[3,1],[4,0],[5,1],[6,0],[7,1],[8,2],[9,0],[10,1],[11,1],[12,0],[13,2],[14,0],[15,0],[16,0],[17,1],[18,1],[19,1],[20,0],[21,1],[22,0],[23,1],[24,2],[25,1],[26,0],[27,0],[28,0],[29,0],[30,1],[31,2],[32,0],[33,2],[34,1],[35,0],[36,1],[37,1],[38,0],[39,0],[40,1],[41,0],[42,1],[43,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

I need to assign colors to each node using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2) such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. Let me start by understanding the structure of the graph.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the nodes and edges. The nodes are 0 through 9. The edges are:\n\n3-8, 1-2, 6-8, 0-6, 2-3, 0-2, 3-9, 5-6, 1-6, 6-9, 3-5, 7-8.\n\nHmm, I should probably visualize this or create an adjacency list to see the connections better.\n\nLet me make an adjacency list for each node:\n\n0: connected to 6, 2\n1: connected to 2, 6\n2: connected to 1, 3, 0\n3: connected to 8, 2, 9, 5, 6 (Wait, edges are 3-8, 2-3, 3-9, 3-5, and 3-6? Wait, looking back: the edges listed include 2-3, 3-9, 3-5, and also 3-8. Wait, the edges given are:\n\n3 - 8, 1 - 2, 6 - 8, 0 - 6, 2 - 3, 0 - 2, 3 - 9, 5 - 6, 1 - 6, 6 - 9, 3 - 5, 7 - 8.\n\nSo for node 3's connections: 8, 2, 9, 5, and also looking at the edges, 6-9 is another edge. Wait, maybe I should recheck each edge.\n\nLet me list all edges properly:\n\nEdges:\n\n3-8\n\n1-2\n\n6-8\n\n0-6\n\n2-3\n\n0-2\n\n3-9\n\n5-6\n\n1-6\n\n6-9\n\n3-5\n\n7-8\n\nSo node 3 is connected to 8, 2, 9, 5, and from 3-5. Wait, the edges for 3 are 3-8, 2-3, 3-9, 3-5. Also, in the edges list, 3-5 is present. So node 3's neighbors are 8, 2, 9, 5.\n\nWait, but also, looking at 6-9: node 6 is connected to 9. So node 6's connections are 8 (from 6-8), 0 (0-6), 5 (5-6), 1 (1-6), 9 (6-9). Also, 0 is connected to 6 and 2. \n\nHmm. Let me make the adjacency list properly:\n\nNode 0: 6, 2\nNode 1: 2, 6\nNode 2: 1, 3, 0\nNode 3: 8, 2, 9, 5, 6 (Wait, 3 is connected to 8 (3-8), 2 (2-3), 9 (3-9), 5 (3-5), and also 6? Wait, no. The edge 3-6 isn't listed. Wait, the edges are as given. Let me recheck. The edges are:\n\n3-8, 1-2, 6-8, 0-6, 2-3, 0-2, 3-9, 5-6, 1-6, 6-9, 3-5, 7-8.\n\nSo for node 3, edges are 3-8, 2-3, 3-9, 3-5. Wait, 3-5 is present. So node 3's neighbors are 8, 2, 9, 5, and 6? Wait, is there a 3-6 edge? No. So node 3 is connected to 8, 2, 9, 5. Wait, then in 6-9 and 3-5? So node 6 is connected to 9 and 5. Hmm. So node 3 is connected to 5. So 3 and 5 are connected. But node 5 is connected to 6 (5-6), so 5 is connected to 3 and 6. \n\nSo node 3's edges are 8, 2,9,5, and no 6. Wait, no. Let me list each node's connections properly.\n\nLet's build adjacency list step by step:\n\nFor each edge, add both directions.\n\nEdge 3-8: add 8 to 3's list, and 3 to 8's list.\n\nEdge 1-2: add 2 to 1's list and vice versa.\n\nEdge 6-8: 6 connected to 8, 8 to 6.\n\nEdge 0-6: 0 and 6 connected.\n\nEdge 2-3: 2 and 3.\n\nEdge 0-2: 0 and 2.\n\nEdge 3-9: 3 and 9.\n\nEdge 5-6: 5 and 6.\n\nEdge 1-6: 1 and 6.\n\nEdge 6-9: 6 and 9.\n\nEdge 3-5: 3 and 5.\n\nEdge 7-8: 7 and 8.\n\nSo let's build each node's adjacency list:\n\n0: connected to 6, 2\n\n1: connected to 2, 6\n\n2: connected to 1, 3, 0\n\n3: connected to 8, 2, 9, 5 (from edges 3-8, 2-3, 3-9, 3-5)\n\nWait, no. Wait, edge 3-8: 3 is connected to 8. Edge 2-3: 3 connected to 2. Edge 3-9: 3 connected to 9. Edge 3-5: 3 connected to 5. So 3's neighbors are 8,2,9,5. But wait, also, edge 6-9 connects 6 and 9, which is separate. So node 3 has four neighbors: 8, 2, 9, 5. Wait, but also, in the edge list, there's 3-5. So yes, 3's neighbors are 8,2,9,5.\n\nWait, but wait, node 6 is connected to 9 (edge 6-9), so 6 and 9 are connected.\n\nSo node 3's neighbors are 8,2,9,5.\n\nThen, node 5: connected to 3 (from 3-5), 6 (5-6).\n\nNode 6's neighbors: 8,0,5,1,9 (from edges 6-8,0-6,5-6,1-6,6-9).\n\nNode 8's neighbors: 3,6,7 (from edges 3-8,6-8,7-8).\n\nNode 7: connected to 8.\n\nNode 9: connected to 3,6.\n\nOkay, so now the adjacency list is clear.\n\nThe challenge is to assign colors 0,1,2 to each node such that adjacent nodes have different colors, using exactly 3 colors. Since the problem says 'exactly 3 colors', it's required that all three colors are used. So some nodes must be colored with each of 0,1,2. But perhaps the graph is 3-colorable, and the question wants a valid 3-coloring. Let's proceed.\n\nI need to assign colors in a way that no two connected nodes have the same color.\n\nLet me start by looking for nodes with high degrees, since they may be more constrained.\n\nLooking at the adjacency lists:\n\n- Node 3 is connected to 4 nodes: 8,2,9,5.\n\n- Node 6 is connected to 5 nodes: 8,0,5,1,9.\n\n- Node 8 is connected to 3,6,7.\n\n- Node 2 is connected to 1,3,0.\n\nSo node 6 has the highest degree (5 edges). Let's start there. Assigning color 0 to node 6. Then its neighbors (8,0,5,1,9) cannot be color 0.\n\nSo neighbors of 6 are 8,0,5,1,9. So these nodes must be 1 or 2.\n\nLet's assign color 0 to node 6.\n\nNow, for node 6's neighbors:\n\nNode 8: can't be 0. Let's assign color 1.\n\nNode 0: can't be 0. Assign color 1 or 2. Maybe alternate.\n\nBut wait, node 0 is connected to 6 (color 0) and to 2. So node 0's color must differ from 6 and from node 2.\n\nSo let's assign color 1 to node 0.\n\nThen, node 2 (connected to 0) can't be 1. It's connected to 0 (color 1), 1, and 3.\n\nWait, node 2's neighbors are 1,3,0. So 0 is color 1. So node 2 can be 0 or 2, but need to check other neighbors.\n\nHmm. Let's see. Let's proceed step by step.\n\n1. Assign color 0 to node 6.\n\nNow, neighbors (8,0,5,1,9) can't be 0.\n\nLet's assign colors to these neighbors.\n\nLet's process node 8 next. Since node 8 is connected to 6 (0) and also to 3 and 7.\n\nAssign color 1 to node 8. Then, node 8's neighbors (3,6,7) must not be 1. 6 is 0, so 3 and 7 can't be 1.\n\nNow node 7 is connected only to 8 (color 1). So node 7 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 2 for node 7.\n\nNext, node 3 is connected to 8 (1), 2,9,5. So node 3 can't be 1. Let's assign color 0 to node 3? Wait, but node 3's neighbors: 8 (1), 2 (unknown), 9 (unknown),5 (unknown). Assigning color 0 to node 3. Then, its neighbors 2,9,5 can't be 0. Let's check.\n\nBut node 3 is connected to 5. So 5 can't be the same as 3's color. Let's say node 3 is color 0.\n\nSo node 3 is color 0.\n\nThen, node 5 (connected to 3 (0) and 6 (0)). Wait, node 5 is connected to 3 (color 0) and 6 (color 0). So node 5 can't be 0, but can be 1 or 2.\n\nWait, but node 5 is connected to 6 (color 0) via edge 5-6. So node 5's color must not be 0. So possible 1 or 2. Let's choose 1 for node 5.\n\nNow, node 5 is color 1. Then, its neighbors: 3 (0), 6 (0) (which is okay), and 5's other neighbor is 6, which is 0. So okay.\n\nMoving on to node 9, which is connected to 3 (0) and 6 (0). So node 9 can't be 0. So possible 1 or 2. Let's pick 2 for node 9.\n\nSo node 9 is 2.\n\nNow, node 3's neighbors: 8 (1), 2 (unknown), 9 (2), 5 (1). So node 3 is color 0. Its neighbor 2 can't be 0. Let's see node 2's connections. Node 2 is connected to 1,3 (0), and 0 (which we assigned 1). So node 2 can't be 0 or 1. Because node 0 is color 1, node 3 is 0, so node 2's color must be 2.\n\nSo node 2 is color 2.\n\nBut then, node 2 is connected to node 1. So node 1 can't be 2. Let's assign color 0 to node 1.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 2 (color 2) and 6 (color 0). So node 1 can be 1, but wait, 6 is 0. So node 1 can't be 0. Wait, node 1's neighbors are 2 (2) and 6 (0). So node 1 can be 1 or 0? Wait, no: node 1 is connected to 6 (color 0) via edge 1-6. So node 1 can't be 0. So possible colors 1 or 2. But also connected to node 2 (color 2). So node 1 can't be 2. Therefore, node 1 must be color 1.\n\nSo node 1 is color 1.\n\nNow, node 0 is connected to 6 (0) and 2 (2). So node 0's color is 1 (as assigned earlier). So that's okay.\n\nNow, node 4 hasn't been mentioned yet. Wait, the nodes are 0-9. Oh right! Node 4 isn't connected to anyone. So node 4 is isolated. Since we need to use exactly 3 colors, we can assign any color to node 4, but we need to ensure that all three colors are used. Since in the current assignments, colors 0,1,2 are already used. So node 4 can be assigned any of them, but to use exactly 3, as long as all three are present. Let me check: current colors used so far.\n\nNodes colored:\n\n0: 1\n\n1: 1\n\n2: 2\n\n3:0\n\n5:1\n\n6:0\n\n7:2\n\n8:1\n\n9:2\n\nSo colors used are 0,1,2. So node 4 can be assigned any of them, but since it's isolated, no constraints. Let's assign color 0 to node 4. That's acceptable.\n\nSo node 4 is color 0.\n\nNow, let's check all edges to ensure no conflicts.\n\nCheck edges:\n\n3-8: 3 is 0, 8 is 1 → okay.\n\n1-2: 1 is 1, 2 is 2 → okay.\n\n6-8: 6 is 0, 8 is 1 → okay.\n\n0-6: 0 is 1, 6 is 0 → okay.\n\n2-3: 2 is 2, 3 is 0 → okay.\n\n0-2: 0 is 1, 2 is 2 → okay.\n\n3-9: 3 is 0, 9 is 2 → okay.\n\n5-6:5 is 1,6 is 0 → okay.\n\n1-6:1 is 1,6 is 0 → okay.\n\n6-9:6 is 0,9 is 2 → okay.\n\n3-5:3 is 0,5 is 1 → okay.\n\n7-8:7 is 2,8 is 1 → okay.\n\nNode 4 has no edges, so no issues.\n\nThat seems to cover all edges. So all assignments are valid.\n\nNow, let's list all nodes with their colors:\n\n0:1\n\n1:1\n\n2:2\n\n3:0\n\n4:0\n\n5:1\n\n6:0\n\n7:2\n\n8:1\n\n9:2\n\nWait, but wait node 1 and 0 are both color 1. Are they connected? The edges for node 1 are 1-2 and 1-6. 1 is connected to 2 (color 2) and 6 (color 0). So node 1's color (1) is different from both, so that's okay.\n\nSimilarly, node 0 is connected to 6 (0) and 2 (2). Its color is 1, which is okay.\n\nNode 4 is isolated and color 0, which is allowed.\n\nAll edges are checked and no two adjacent nodes have the same color. Also, all three colors (0,1,2) are used. So this should be a valid solution.\n\nBut let me just verify again each node:\n\nNode 0: color 1. Connected to 6 (0) and 2 (2) → okay.\n\nNode 1: color 1. Connected to 2 (2) and 6 (0) → okay.\n\nNode 2: color 2. Connected to 1 (1), 3 (0), 0 (1) → okay.\n\nNode 3: color 0. Connected to 8 (1), 2 (2), 9 (2), 5 (1) → okay.\n\nNode 4: color 0. No connections → okay.\n\nNode 5: color 1. Connected to 6 (0), 3 (0) → okay.\n\nNode 6: color 0. Connected to 8 (1), 0 (1), 5 (1), 1 (1), 9 (2) → okay.\n\nNode 7: color 2. Connected to 8 (1) → okay.\n\nNode 8: color 1. Connected to 3 (0), 6 (0), 7 (2) → okay.\n\nNode 9: color 2. Connected to 3 (0), 6 (0) → okay.\n\nYes, all edges are properly colored. And all three colors are used (0 for nodes 3,4,6; 1 for 0,1,5,8; 2 for 2,7,9). So this meets the requirement of using exactly 3 colors. So this should be the correct answer.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 1], [6, 0], [7, 2], [8, 1], [9, 2]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

I need to color a graph with nodes 0 through 13 using exactly 3 colors. The colors are numbered 0, 1, 2. The edges are given, so I have to make sure that no two connected nodes share the same color. Let me start by listing out all the edges to understand the connections.\n\nThe edges are:\n0 -7\n2-4\n1-5\n5-8\n0-13\n0-9\n5-7\n2-12\n8-12\n8-11\n0-8\n7-11\n0-11\n3-11\n\nHmm. Let me visualize or maybe build an adjacency list. Let's list each node and who they are connected to.\n\nNode 0 is connected to 7,13,9,8,11. Oh, that's a lot. So node 0 has edges to 7,13,9,8,11. Also, 0 is connected to 8, which connects to 12, 11, etc. \n\nNode 1 is connected to 5.\nNode 2 is connected to 4 and 12.\nNode 3 connected to 11.\nNode 5 connected to 1,8,7.\nNode 7 connected to 0,5,11.\nNode 8 connected to 5,12,11,0,12 (wait, the edges list says 5-8,8-12,8-11,0-8. So node8 is connected to 5,12,11,0.\nNode 12 connected to 2,8,12? Wait, edges are 2-12,8-12. So node12 connected to 2 and 8.\nNode 11 connected to 8,7,0,3.\nNode 4 connected to 2.\nNode 9 connected to 0.\nNode 13 connected to 0.\nNode 10: Wait, the nodes are 0-13, but in the edges listed, node10 isn't mentioned. So node10 has no edges. So node10 can be colored any color, but since we're allowed exactly 3 colors, maybe use color 0 for it.\n\nWait, but the problem says the graph has nodes 0-13, but some nodes might not have edges. So node6 and node10 aren't connected to anyone. So they can be colored with any color, but since the required number is 3, they can take any of the colors. So their color choice is flexible.\n\nBut the main challenge is the connected nodes. Let me start with the nodes that have the highest degree, as they might be more constrained.\n\nLooking at node0: connected to 7,13,9,8,11. That's five edges. So node0's color must be different from all those nodes. Similarly, node8 is connected to 0,5,12,11, which are 4 edges. So nodes with high degrees need to be colored first.\n\nSo perhaps start assigning colors to node0, then its neighbors, making sure not to conflict.\n\nLet me pick a color for node0. Let's say color 0. Then all its neighbors (7,13,9,8,11) can't be color0.\n\nBut wait, if node0 is color0, then nodes7,13,9,8,11 must be colors1 or 2. Let's see. Then, for node7, which is connected to node0 (color0), node5 (connected via 5-7), and node11 (connected via7-11). So node7's color must be different from 0, and also different from node5 and node11.\n\nHmm, this could get complicated. Alternatively, maybe using a graph coloring approach where I process each node in order and assign the first available color that doesn't conflict with already colored neighbors.\n\nLet me list all nodes in order and try to assign colors step by step.\n\nStarting with node0. Assign color0. Then its neighbors (7,13,9,8,11) can't be color0.\n\nNext, node1: connected to 5. Since node1 isn't connected to any other nodes except 5. Let's assign color0 to node1. Then node5 can't be color0.\n\nNode2: connected to 4 and 12. Let's assign color0 to node2. Then node4 and 12 can't be color0.\n\nNode3: connected to 11. Let's assign color0. So node11 can't be color0.\n\nNode4: connected to node2 (color0), so node4 can be color1.\n\nNode5: connected to 1 (color0), so it can't be color0. Let's assign color1 to node5. But node5 is also connected to 8 and 7. So when coloring node5, we need to check its neighbors. Wait, node5 is connected to 1 (color0), 8, and 7. So node5 can't be color0. Assign color1. Then, nodes8 and 7 can't be color1 if they're connected to node5.\n\nNode6: no connections. Assign color0.\n\nNode7: connected to 0 (color0), 5 (color1), and 11. So node7 can't be 0 or 1. So color2.\n\nNode8: connected to 0 (color0), 5 (color1), 12 (node2's neighbor?), and 11. So node8 can't be color0 (due to node0) or color1 (due to node5). So assign color2.\n\nBut then node8 is color2. Now, node12 is connected to node8 (color2) and node2 (color0). So node12 can't be 0 or 2. Assign color1.\n\nNode9: connected to node0 (color0). Assign color1.\n\nNode10: no connections. Assign color0.\n\nNode11: connected to 0 (color0), 7 (color2), 8 (color2), and 3 (color0). So node11 can't be 0 or 2. So color1.\n\nBut wait, node3 is connected to node11. Node3 is color0, so node11 can't be 0. So node11 is color1.\n\nNode12: connected to node2 (color0) and node8 (color2). So possible colors are 1. Assign color1.\n\nNode13: connected to node0 (color0). Assign color1.\n\nNow let's check for conflicts:\n\nCheck node8: color2. Its neighbors: 0 (0), 5 (1), 12 (1), 11 (1). No conflict.\n\nCheck node7: color2. Neighbors 0 (0), 5 (1), 11 (1). No conflict.\n\nCheck node11: color1. Neighbors 8 (2),7 (2),0 (0),3 (0). No conflict.\n\nCheck node5: color1. Neighbors 1 (0), 8 (2),7 (2). All okay.\n\nNode8's color is 2, which is okay with its neighbors.\n\nNode12's color is 1: connected to node2 (0) and node8 (2) – okay.\n\nNode3 is color0, connected to node11 (1). Good.\n\nBut wait, node8 is color2. Let's check node8's neighbors again. Node0 (0) – okay. Node5 (1) – okay. Node12 (1) – okay. Node11 (1) – okay. So all correct.\n\nWhat about node7's color is 2. It's connected to node0 (0) and node5 (1), node11 (1). Correct.\n\nNode11's color is 1. Connected to 0 (0), 7 (2),8 (2),3 (0) – okay.\n\nNow, let's check node5's color. It's 1. Connected to node1 (0), node8 (2), node7 (2). All good.\n\nWhat about node0's neighbors:\n\n7 (2), 13 (1),9 (1),8 (2),11 (1). All different from 0. Good.\n\nNode2's color is 0. Neighbors 4 (1) and 12 (1). All good.\n\nNode4's color is 1. Connected to node2 (0). Correct.\n\nNode12's color is 1. Connected to node2 (0) and node8 (2). Correct.\n\nNode1's color is 0. Connected to node5 (1). Good.\n\nNode3's color is 0. Connected to node11 (1). Correct.\n\nNode9 is color1. Connected to node0 (0). Correct.\n\nNode13 is color1. Connected to node0 (0). Correct.\n\nNode6 and 10 are color0. No issues.\n\nWait, but node6 is not connected to any node, so any color is okay.\n\nNow, what about node8 and node7: node8 is color2, node7 is color2. Are they connected? Let me check the edges. Wait, node7 is connected to 0,5,11. Node8 is connected to 0,5,12,11. So 7 and 8 are connected? Wait, looking back at the edges list: do 7 and 8 have an edge?\n\nWait, edges list: 0-8 is present. Is there a 7-8 edge? Let me check. The edges given are:\n\n0-7, 2-4, 1-5,5-8,0-13,0-9,5-7,2-12,8-12,8-11,0-8,7-11,0-11,3-11.\n\nNo, there's no direct edge between 7 and 8. So nodes7 and8 are not connected. So their colors can be same. So node7 is color2, node8 is color2. That's allowed because they're not adjacent.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nSo the coloring seems valid. Let me list all the nodes with their assigned colors:\n\n0:0\n\n1:0\n\n2:0\n\n3:0\n\n4:1\n\n5:1\n\n6:0\n\n7:2\n\n8:2\n\n9:1\n\n10:0\n\n11:1\n\n12:1\n\n13:1\n\nWait, but wait node1 is color0, node5 is color1. That's correct. Node5's neighbor is node1 (0). So node5 can be color1.\n\nBut wait, node5 is connected to node8 (color2). So node5 is 1, node8 is 2. Good.\n\nNow, node10 is color0. Since no edges, correct.\n\nNode3 is color0. Connected to node11 (1). Correct.\n\nWait, but let's check if all nodes are accounted for: nodes 0-13. Let me list all:\n\n0:0\n\n1:0\n\n2:0\n\n3:0\n\n4:1\n\n5:1\n\n6:0\n\n7:2\n\n8:2\n\n9:1\n\n10:0\n\n11:1\n\n12:1\n\n13:1\n\nYes, all 14 nodes are covered. Now check if all edges are satisfied.\n\nEdge 0-7: 0 and7 are 0 and2. Good.\n\nEdge2-4:2 (0) and4 (1). Good.\n\nEdge1-5:1 (0) and5 (1). Good.\n\n5-8:5 (1),8 (2). Good.\n\n0-13:0,13 (1). Good.\n\n0-9:0,9 (1). Good.\n\n5-7:5 (1),7 (2). Good.\n\n2-12:2 (0),12 (1). Good.\n\n8-12:8 (2),12 (1). Good.\n\n8-11:8 (2),11 (1). Good.\n\n0-8:0,8 (2). Good.\n\n7-11:7 (2),11 (1). Good.\n\n0-11:0,11 (1). Good.\n\n3-11:3 (0),11 (1). Good.\n\nAll edges are okay. The nodes with no edges (6,10) are colored 0. That's acceptable since we can use exactly 3 colors. But in this case, the colors used are 0,1,2. For example, color2 is used in nodes7 and8. So three colors are used. So the answer meets the requirement.\n\nSo the final answer is a list of [node, color] pairs. Let me format that as JSON:\n\n[[0,0], [1,0], [2,0], [3,0], [4,1], [5,1], [6,0], [7,2], [8,2], [9,1], [10,0], [11,1], [12,1], [13,1]]\n\nWait, but the problem says colors are numbered 0-2. Yes. But the user mentioned \"exactly 3 colors\", so using all three. In this solution, color0 is used for nodes 0,1,2,3,6,10. Color1 for 4,5,9,11,12,13. Color2 for7,8. So three colors are used.

Let me check the original input again.\n\nOriginal edges as given (split by commas):\n\n0 - 30, 7 - 23, 33 - 42, 18 - 20, 7 - 20, 3 - 7, 20 - 32, 12 - 22, 29 - 38, 20 - 35, 34 - 37, 3 - 31, 28 - 30, 17 - 30, 20 - 41, 17 - 27, 14 - 40, 23 - 40, 12 - 43, 19 - 33, 15 - 32, 24 - 41, 5 - 9, 39 - 41, 38 - 43, 18 - 43, 17 - 20, 2 - 7, 17 - 26, 19 - 26, 0 - 22, 19 - 29, 19 - 35, 24 - 25, 11 - 43, 33 - 43, 4 - 7, 35 - 43, 4 - 13, 4 - 31, 4 - 40, 34 - 41, 11 - 33, 15 - 43, 22 - 30, 0 - 3, 4 - 31, 4 - 40, 34 - 37, 35 - 43, 11 - 33, 15 - 43.\n\nWait, perhaps there are some duplicates here. But maybe not. Let me check each edge once. For example, 4-31 appears twice. But perhaps the user intended to list all edges correctly. So I'll proceed with the list as given, assuming duplicates are possible but in the actual problem, edges are undirected and unique. So maybe some of these are duplicates, but I need to process them all. However, when building the adjacency list, duplicates can be ignored since each edge is undirected. For example, if 4-7 is listed again, it's the same as the previous occurrence.\n\nNow, building the adjacency list for each node.\n\nLet me start by listing each node and their adjacent nodes.\n\nFor example, node 0 is connected to 30, 22, 3 (from edges 0-30, 0-22, 0-3).\n\nSimilarly, node 7 is connected to 23, 20, 3, 2, 4 (from edges 7-23, 7-20, 3-7, 2-7, 4-7).\n\nNode 20 has a lot of connections: 18, 7, 32, 35, 41, 17, 20's edges are 18-20, 7-20, 20-32, 20-35, 20-41, 17-20, 17-20 (maybe duplicate), so adjacent nodes are 18,7,32,35,41,17.\n\nThis seems a bit complex. To handle this properly, I'll create an adjacency list structure where each node's adjacent nodes are stored, avoiding duplicates.\n\nLet me proceed step by step. For each edge NodeA - NodeB, add NodeB to NodeA's list and NodeA to NodeB's list.\n\nBut perhaps using a data structure here would be too time-consuming for me to do manually, but since I'm trying to figure out the coloring, maybe I can approach it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start by looking for nodes with high degrees (many connections) and assign colors to them first, ensuring their neighbors get different colors.\n\nLooking at the edges, node 20 seems highly connected. Let's check:\n\nEdges involving node 20:\n\n18-20,7-20,20-32,20-35,20-41,17-20, also perhaps others. From the list, the edges are:\n\n18-20,7-20,20-32,20-35,20-41,17-20,17-20 again? So adjacent nodes to 20: 18,7,32,35,41,17, and possibly others? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal edges:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n18 - 20\n\n7 - 20\n\n20 - 32\n\n20 - 35\n\n20 - 41\n\n17 - 20\n\nAlso, from the edges, 17-20 is mentioned twice (once in \"17 - 20\" and again in \"17 - 20, 2-7\" — but perhaps that's a typo. But regardless, the adjacency list for 20 includes 18,7,32,35,41,17, and possibly any others? Let me confirm.\n\nWait, in the original list of edges, after the initial entries, there's \"17 - 20, 2 - 7, 17 - 26, 19 - 26, 0 - 22, 19 - 29, 19 - 35, 24 - 25, 11 - 43, 33 - 43, 4 - 7, 35 - 43, 4 - 13, 4 - 31, 4 - 40, 34 - 41, 11 - 33, 15 - 43, 22 - 30, 0 - 3, 4 - 31, 4 - 40, 34 - 37, 35 - 43, 11 - 33, 15 - 43\".\n\nWait, perhaps some of the edges are duplicated. For example, 17-20 is mentioned again in \"17 - 20, 2 -7...\" So perhaps node 20 is connected to 17, which was already listed. So node 20's adjacency list includes 18,7,32,35,41,17, and others? Let me check all edges again:\n\nLooking through each edge pair:\n\n- 0-30\n\n- 7-23\n\n- 33-42\n\n- 18-20\n\n- 7-20\n\n- 3-7\n\n- 20-32\n\n- 12-22\n\n- 29-38\n\n- 20-35\n\n- 34-37\n\n- 3-31\n\n- 28-30\n\n- 17-30\n\n- 20-41\n\n- 17-27\n\n- 14-40\n\n- 23-40\n\n- 12-43\n\n- 19-33\n\n- 15-32\n\n- 24-41\n\n- 5-9\n\n- 39-41\n\n- 38-43\n\n- 18-43\n\n- 17-20\n\n- 2-7\n\n- 17-26\n\n- 19-26\n\n- 0-22\n\n- 19-29\n\n- 19-35\n\n- 24-25\n\n- 11-43\n\n- 33-43\n\n- 4-7\n\n- 35-43\n\n- 4-13\n\n- 4-31\n\n- 4-40\n\n- 34-41\n\n- 11-33\n\n- 15-43\n\n- 22-30\n\n- 0-3\n\n- 4-31 (duplicate?)\n\n- 4-40 (duplicate?)\n\n- 34-37 (duplicate?)\n\n- 35-43 (duplicate?)\n\n- 11-33 (duplicate?)\n\n- 15-43 (duplicate?)\n\nHmm, perhaps the original input had some duplicated edges due to formatting, but regardless, the adjacency list for each node is as per the unique edges.\n\nSo, node 20's connections are: 18, 7, 32, 35, 41, 17 (from the edges 18-20,7-20,20-32,20-35,20-41,17-20). So that's six connections. So node 20 has degree 6.\n\nSimilarly, let's check node 4's connections. Edges involving 4:\n\n4-7 (appears multiple times?), 4-13, 4-31, 4-40, 4-31 again. So node 4 is connected to 7,13,31,40. Wait, 4-7, 4-13, 4-31, 4-40. So four connections.\n\nAnother node with high degree is 43. Let's see:\n\nEdges involving 43: 12-43, 38-43, 18-43, 35-43, 11-43, 33-43, 15-43, etc. Let's list them:\n\n- 12-43\n\n- 38-43\n\n- 18-43\n\n- 35-43 (appears multiple times?)\n\n- 11-43\n\n- 33-43\n\n- 15-43\n\nSo node 43 is connected to 12,38,18,35,11,33,15. That's seven connections. So node 43 has a degree of 7, which is quite high. So node 43 is connected to many other nodes.\n\nSimilarly, node 7 is connected to 0 (wait, no, node 0 is connected to 30,22,3. Node 7's edges are: 7-23, 7-20, 3-7, 2-7,4-7. So node 7 is connected to 23,20,3,2,4. Degree 5.\n\nNode 17: edges 17-30, 17-27,17-20,17-26. So connected to 30,27,20,26. Degree 4.\n\nNode 19: connected to 33,29,35,26 (from edges 19-33,19-29,19-35,19-26). So four connections.\n\nNode 35: connected to 20,43 (from 20-35 and 35-43, and others? Let's check. Edges: 20-35,19-35,35-43. So node 35 is connected to 20,19,43. Also, any others?\n\nYes, from the edge list, 19-35 is one, 20-35, 35-43. So three connections.\n\nHmm, perhaps node 43 is the highest degree node. So starting with node 43. Assign color 0. Then all its neighbors (12,38,18,35,11,33,15) must be colored 1 or 2.\n\nBut since the graph needs exactly 3 colors, maybe we can use a greedy approach, but ensuring that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.\n\nAlternatively, since 3 colors are required, perhaps the graph is 3-colorable. Let's proceed.\n\nAnother approach: assign colors in a way that alternates based on layers. Start with node 43 (color 0), then assign different colors to its neighbors, then their neighbors, etc.\n\nBut maybe it's better to process each node and assign the smallest possible color not used by its neighbors.\n\nBut since the problem requires exactly 3 colors, perhaps it's a 3-colorable graph. So the greedy algorithm should work here.\n\nLet's try to create a list of nodes and assign colors step by step.\n\nFirst, create the adjacency list for each node. Since doing this manually is time-consuming, but let's try to note the key connections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps group nodes into clusters where certain nodes are connected. For example, nodes connected to 43 form a cluster. Let's consider that.\n\nNode 43's neighbors: 12,38,18,35,11,33,15.\n\nSo these seven nodes. Each must have a color different from 43's color (0). So their colors can be 1 or 2.\n\nBut since they are connected to each other? For example, 12 is connected to 43 and 22 (from edge 12-22). Also, 38 is connected to 29,43. 18 is connected to 20 and 43. 35 is connected to 20,19,43. 11 connected to 43 and 33. 33 connected to 42,19,43,11. 15 connected to 32 and 43.\n\nSo the neighbors of 43 are not all connected to each other. So perhaps they can be colored with 1 and 2.\n\nLet's start by assigning colors:\n\nAssign node 43: color 0.\n\nThen, for each neighbor of 43:\n\n- 12: connected to 43 (color 0), so can be 1 or 2.\n\n- 38: connected to 43 (0), so 1 or 2.\n\n- 18: connected to 43 (0), and also to 20. Need to check 20's color when we get there.\n\nBut maybe process these nodes first.\n\nAlternatively, pick a node and proceed step by step.\n\nLet's choose an order. Let's list all nodes and process them in order from 0 to 45, assigning the lowest possible color not used by already colored neighbors.\n\nBut given that the adjacency list is large, doing this manually would be error-prone. Let's look for a possible pattern.\n\nAlternatively, think of the graph as a collection of connected components. But given the edges, perhaps it's connected as a single component.\n\nAlternatively, find a node with a loop or some structure. But since the problem states it's possible to color with 3 colors, I need to proceed.\n\nLet me try to create a possible coloring step by step.\n\nFirst, assign color 0 to node 43. Then, its neighbors (12,38,18,35,11,33,15) need to be colored 1 or 2.\n\nLet's assign colors to these nodes. Let's process them in order:\n\n12: connected to 43 (0) and 22. Assign 1.\n\n38: connected to 43 (0) and 29. Assign 1.\n\n18: connected to 43 (0) and 20. Assign 1.\n\n35: connected to 43 (0), 20,19. Assign 1.\n\n11: connected to 43 (0) and 33. Assign 1.\n\n33: connected to 43 (0), 19, 42, 11. Assign 1. Wait, but 11 is color 1, so 33 can't be 1. So assign 2.\n\n15: connected to 43 (0) and 32. Assign 1.\n\nSo after processing neighbors of 43:\n\n43:0\n\n12:1\n\n38:1\n\n18:1\n\n35:1\n\n11:1\n\n33:2\n\n15:1\n\nNow, proceed to their neighbors.\n\nNext, node 12 is connected to 22. Assign 22 a color different from 12 (1). So 22 can be 0 or 2. But 22 is also connected to 0 (from edge 0-22). Let's look at node 0.\n\nNode 0 is connected to 30,22,3. Let's assign color to 0. If 22 is assigned 0, then 0 must not be 0. Suppose 22 is assigned 2. Then 0 can take 1, but also check neighbors.\n\nBut maybe let's proceed in order. Process node 0 next.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to process each node in order, starting from 0 to 45, assigning the smallest available color not used by already assigned neighbors.\n\nBut since this is a manual process, let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet me start by coloring node 0. Let's pick color 0. But check its neighbors.\n\nNode 0 is connected to 30, 22, 3. So when coloring node 0, we need to check the colors of 30,22,3. But if those nodes haven't been colored yet, then we can assign 0 to node 0, but then 30,22,3 must have different colors.\n\nAlternatively, assign colors in order. Let's start with node 0.\n\nAssume nodes are processed in order 0,1,2,...45.\n\nNode 0: assign color 0. Then its neighbors (30,22,3) cannot be 0.\n\nNode 1: not connected to any node? Let's check edges. The edges provided don't mention node 1 except in the list of nodes. Wait, looking back at the edges, I don't see node 1 connected to anyone. Because in the edges list, the edges start with 0-30,7-23, etc. So node 1 is not connected to any other node. So node 1 can be colored 0.\n\nWait, but let's verify. The edges given in the problem:\n\nThe list starts with 0-30, 7-23, 33-42, etc. So node 1 doesn't appear in any edge. Therefore, node 1 is isolated. So it can be colored any color. But the problem says to use exactly 3 colors, but since it's possible, we can assign 0 to it.\n\nProceeding:\n\nNode 0: color 0.\n\nNode 1: color 0 (since no edges, can choose any color, but let's pick 0 to use as few colors as possible, though the problem requires exactly 3. Wait, the problem says 'using exactly 3 colors', which means all three colors must be used. So even if some nodes could be colored with fewer, we need to ensure that all three are used. But perhaps in this graph, the minimal required is 3, so it's okay. But the answer must use exactly 3, not fewer. So even if some nodes can be colored with 2, but others need 3, then it's okay. So node 1 can be colored 0, as it's isolated.\n\nBut for the problem's purpose, as long as three colors are used somewhere. So in the final assignment, make sure that colors 0,1,2 are all present.\n\nProceeding with the manual coloring:\n\nNode 0: 0.\n\nNode 1: 0.\n\nNode 2: connected to 7 (edge 2-7). So when coloring node 2, check node 7's color. If node 7 hasn't been colored yet, assign the smallest possible color. But let's process nodes in order.\n\nNode 2: connected to 7. So when coloring node 2, check node 7's color. Let's see:\n\nNode 7 is connected to 23, 20, 3, 2,4 (edges 7-23,7-20,3-7,2-7,4-7). So when we get to node 7, we'll need to assign a color different from its already colored neighbors. But processing in order, node 7 is after node 0,1,2.\n\nWait, the nodes are numbered 0-45. So processing order is 0,1,2,3,...45.\n\nSo node 2 comes before node 7. So when coloring node 2, its neighbor node 7 hasn't been colored yet. Therefore, node 2 can be colored 0 (since no constraints from other neighbors, as node 2's other edges are 2-7, but node 7 is not yet colored). But then, when we process node 7 later, we have to make sure it's not color 0. But this might lead to conflicts. Alternatively, maybe assign node 2 a color different from its already processed neighbors. Since node 2 has no processed neighbors (only node 7, which is unprocessed), so assign color 0. Then node 7 must be different.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step:\n\nNode 0: color 0.\n\nNode 1: color 0.\n\nNode 2: no processed neighbors except perhaps none. Assign color 0. Then node 7, when processed, must not be 0.\n\nNode 3: connected to 0 (edge 0-3) and 7, 31 (edges 3-7, 3-31). So when coloring node 3, neighbors 0 (color 0) and 7 (not colored yet). So node 3 must not be 0. Assign the next available color, 1.\n\nNode 4: connected to 7,13,31,40 (edges 4-7,4-13,4-31,4-40). Neighbors 7 (not colored), 13 (not colored), etc. Assign color 0 (since no constraints from already colored neighbors. Nodes 0-4 are processed so far. So node 4's neighbors are all unprocessed. So assign 0.\n\nBut wait, node 4 is connected to node 7 (which is node 7), but node 7 hasn't been processed yet. So when coloring node 4, its color is 0. Then node 7, when processed, must avoid color 0.\n\nProceeding:\n\nNode 0:0\n\nNode1:0\n\nNode2:0\n\nNode3:1\n\nNode4:0\n\nNode5: connected to 9. So when processing node5, node9 is not colored yet. Assign 0.\n\nNode5:0.\n\nNode6: no edges listed. Assign 0.\n\nWait, the nodes go up to 45. Are there any nodes not mentioned in edges? For example, node6: I don't see any edges involving node6. So it's isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNode6:0.\n\nNode7: connected to 23,20,3 (color1),2 (color0),4 (color0). So neighbors 3 (1),2 (0),4 (0). So the colors used are 0 and1. Assign the smallest available color not used: 2.\n\nSo node7:2.\n\nNode8: no edges. Assign 0.\n\nNode8:0.\n\nNode9: connected to5 (color0). Assign 1.\n\nNode9:1.\n\nNode10: no edges. Assign0.\n\nNode10:0.\n\nNode11: connected to43 (color0 from earlier step?) and 33 (color2). Wait, earlier when processing node43's neighbors, node11 was assigned color1. But perhaps my earlier approach is conflicting.\n\nWait, this is where manual processing becomes error-prone. Let me retrace.\n\nEarlier, I started by assigning node43:0. Then its neighbors:12,38,18,35,11,33,15. For those, I assigned:\n\n12:1\n\n38:1\n\n18:1\n\n35:1\n\n11:1\n\n33:2 (since 11 is 1)\n\n15:1.\n\nBut in processing nodes in order, node11 is processed later. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by trying to color node43's neighbors first, but in reality, when processing nodes in order 0-45, node43 is node43, which is processed later. So this approach is conflicting.\n\nAh, right. The problem is that when coloring nodes in order, node43 is processed after many other nodes. So my earlier approach of coloring node43 first is not following the order. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is to process each node in order, assigning the smallest possible color not used by its already processed neighbors.\n\nBut since the nodes are numbered 0-45, and processing in that order, node43 is processed after node0 to node42.\n\nSo let's start over and proceed in order, node by node.\n\nStart with node0:\n\nNode0's edges: connected to30,22,3. These nodes are higher in number (30,22,3). When processing node0, these nodes haven't been processed yet. So node0 can choose color0.\n\nnode0:0.\n\nnode1: no edges. color0.\n\nnode2: edges are 2-7. Node7 is unprocessed. So color0.\n\nnode3: edges to0 (0),7,31. Node0 is colored0. So node3 can't be0. Assign color1.\n\nnode4: edges to7,13,31,40. All unprocessed. Assign color0.\n\nnode5: edges to9. Assign color0.\n\nnode6: no edges. color0.\n\nnode7: edges to23,20,3 (1),2 (0),4 (0). Processed neighbors are3 (1),2 (0),4 (0). So used colors0 and1. Assign color2.\n\nnode7:2.\n\nnode8: no edges. color0.\n\nnode9: connected to5 (0). Assign color1.\n\nnode9:1.\n\nnode10: no edges. color0.\n\nnode11: edges to43,33. Both unprocessed. Assign color0.\n\nnode11:0.\n\nnode12: edges to22,43. Assign color0 (since 22 and43 are unprocessed).\n\nWait, when processing node12, its neighbors are22 and43 (both not processed yet). So color0.\n\nBut when we later process node43, which is connected to node12 (color0), we'll have to assign a different color to node43.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nnode12:0.\n\nnode13: connected to4 (color0). Assign color1.\n\nnode13:1.\n\nnode14: edges to40. Assign color0.\n\nnode14:0.\n\nnode15: edges to32,43. Assign color0.\n\nnode15:0.\n\nnode16: no edges. Assign0.\n\nnode16:0.\n\nnode17: edges to30,27,20,26. All unprocessed. Assign0.\n\nnode17:0.\n\nnode18: edges to20,43. Assign0.\n\nnode18:0.\n\nnode19: edges to33,29,35,26. Assign0.\n\nnode19:0.\n\nnode20: edges to18 (0),7 (2),32,35,41,17 (0). Processed neighbors:18 (0),7 (2),17 (0). So colors used are0 and2. Assign color1.\n\nnode20:1.\n\nnode21: no edges. Assign0.\n\nnode21:0.\n\nnode22: edges to0 (0),12 (0). Processed neighbors:0 (0),12 (0). So can't be0. Assign1.\n\nnode22:1.\n\nnode23: edges to7 (2),40. Assign0 (since7 is2, no constraint from40 yet).\n\nnode23:0.\n\nnode24: edges to41,25. Assign0.\n\nnode24:0.\n\nnode25: edges to24 (0). Assign1.\n\nnode25:1.\n\nnode26: edges to17 (0),19 (0). Assign1.\n\nnode26:1.\n\nnode27: edges to17 (0). Assign1.\n\nnode27:1.\n\nnode28: edges to30. Assign0.\n\nnode28:0.\n\nnode29: edges to38,19 (0). Assign1 (since19 is0).\n\nnode29:1.\n\nnode30: edges to0 (0),28 (0),17 (0),22 (1). Processed neighbors:0 (0),28 (0),17 (0),22 (1). So used colors0 and1. Assign2.\n\nnode30:2.\n\nnode31: edges to3 (1),4 (0). Processed neighbors:3 (1),4 (0). Assign2.\n\nnode31:2.\n\nnode32: edges to20 (1),15 (0). Assign0 (since20 is1, 15 is0. So can't be0 or1? Wait, no. node32's processed neighbors are20 (color1) and15 (color0). So colors used are0 and1. Assign color2.\n\nBut wait, node32 is being processed now. So when processing node32, its processed neighbors are20 (1) and15 (0). So node32 can't be 0 or1. Assign color2.\n\nnode32:2.\n\nnode33: edges to42,19 (0),43,11 (0). Processed neighbors:19 (0),11 (0). So assign1.\n\nnode33:1.\n\nnode34: edges to37,41. Assign0.\n\nnode34:0.\n\nnode35: edges to20 (1),19 (0),43. Assign0 (since20 is1, 19 is0. 43 hasn't been processed. So assign the smallest possible color not used by processed neighbors (0 and1). So color2.\n\nWait, processed neighbors are20 (1),19 (0). So colors 0 and1. So available colors:2. Assign2.\n\nnode35:2.\n\nnode36: no edges. Assign0.\n\nnode36:0.\n\nnode37: edges to34 (0). Assign1.\n\nnode37:1.\n\nnode38: edges to29 (1),43. Assign0 (since29 is1, no other processed neighbors).\n\nnode38:0.\n\nnode39: edges to41. Assign0.\n\nnode39:0.\n\nnode40: edges to14 (0),23 (0),4 (0). Processed neighbors:14 (0),23 (0),4 (0). Assign1.\n\nnode40:1.\n\nnode41: edges to20 (1),24 (0),39 (0),34 (0). Processed neighbors:20 (1),24 (0),39 (0),34 (0). Colors used:0 and1. Assign2.\n\nnode41:2.\n\nnode42: edges to33 (1). Assign0.\n\nnode42:0.\n\nnode43: edges to12 (0),38 (0),18 (0),35 (2),11 (0),33 (1),15 (0). Processed neighbors:12 (0),38 (0),18 (0),35 (2),11 (0),33 (1),15 (0). Colors used:0,1,2. So the available colors are none? Wait, but node43 must be assigned a color different from all its neighbors. Since its neighbors have colors0,0,0,2,0,1,0. So colors used are0,1,2. So no color available. This is a problem.\n\nWait, this indicates a conflict. Because node43's neighbors are colored 0,0,0,2,0,1,0. So when processing node43, we need to assign a color not in {0,1,2} (but we only have 0,1,2). But this is impossible. Hence, my previous approach has led to a contradiction. This means that the order in which I colored the nodes caused a problem, and the greedy approach failed here.\n\nThis suggests that the initial coloring order needs to be adjusted. Perhaps node43 should be colored earlier, or the colors of its neighbors adjusted.\n\nHmm. Let's see where things went wrong. Node43's neighbors:\n\n-12:0\n\n-38:0\n\n-18:0\n\n-35:2\n\n-11:0\n\n-33:1\n\n-15:0\n\nSo when coloring node43, it needs to choose a color different from all these. But since the colors are 0,1,2, and all three are present, it's impossible. Hence, the initial approach of coloring in order leads to a conflict.\n\nThus, this indicates that the order of coloring is critical. To avoid this, perhaps we need to adjust the colors of some nodes before reaching node43.\n\nFor example, maybe changing the color of some of node43's neighbors to allow node43 to have a valid color.\n\nLet's revisit the coloring steps and adjust where possible.\n\nLet me try again, but this time processing node43 earlier. However, since the processing order is 0 to 45, node43 is processed after nodes 0-42. So perhaps I need to adjust the colors of some of its neighbors before node43 is processed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem arises because node35 is colored 2. If node35 were colored a different color, then node43 could be colored 2.\n\nWait, node35 is connected to 20 (color1),19 (color0), and43. When node35 is processed, its processed neighbors are20 (1) and19 (0). So the available color is 2. So it's colored 2. Then node43, when processed, sees neighbor35 as 2, which is a problem.\n\nSo perhaps if node35 could be colored 1 instead of 2, then node43 would have neighbors colored 0,0,0,1,0,1,0, allowing node43 to be colored 2.\n\nBut how to achieve that?\n\nWhen processing node35:\n\nNode35's processed neighbors are20 (color1) and19 (color0). So colors used are 0 and1. Thus, the smallest available color is2. So node35 must be colored2. So we can't change that.\n\nHmm. So the problem is that node43's neighbors include a node colored2 (node35), which makes it impossible to color node43.\n\nBut this suggests that the graph cannot be colored with 3 colors, which contradicts the problem's requirement. However, the problem states that a valid 3-coloring exists. Therefore, there must be a different way to color the nodes.\n\nThis indicates that the initial greedy approach, processing nodes in order, leads to a conflict. Therefore, another approach is needed.\n\nAlternative approach: use backtracking or look for a coloring that avoids this conflict. Let's see.\n\nLet's consider the subgraph involving node43 and its neighbors.\n\nNode43's neighbors:12,38,18,35,11,33,15.\n\nWe need to color these seven nodes with colors 1 and 2 such that no two adjacent nodes in this group have the same color.\n\nBut some of these neighbors are connected to each other. For example:\n\n- 12 is connected to22 and43. 12's other neighbor is22, which is connected to0 (color0) and30 (color2).\n\nWait, but in the initial processing, node22 was colored1.\n\nAnother example: node33 is connected to42 (color0),19 (color0),43, and11. Node33 was colored1. Node11 is colored0. So node33's color is1.\n\nNode35 is colored2, connected to43 and20 (color1),19 (color0).\n\nIf node43 can't be colored, perhaps we need to adjust the color of one of its neighbors.\n\nFor example, if we can change node35's color to1, then node43 could be colored2.\n\nBut node35 is connected to20 (color1) and19 (color0). So node35 can't be color0 or1. So it must be color2. That's why it's colored2.\n\nAnother option is to change the color of node33. Node33 is connected to11 (color0),42 (color0),19 (color0), and43. So when node33 was processed, its processed neighbors were11 (0),19 (0), and42 (0) (if node42 is colored0). Thus, node33 could be colored1, which is okay.\n\nBut then node43's neighbors include 33 (1), so node43 can't be1.\n\nAlternatively, node43's neighbors have colors 0,0,0,2,0,1,0. So the colors are 0,1,2.\n\nThus, it's impossible to color node43.\n\nBut this can't be right because the problem states that a valid 3-coloring exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the previous step.\n\nLet me check the coloring of node35 again. Node35 is connected to20 (color1),19 (color0), and43. When processing node35 (node35 is processed in order after node0 to node34), its processed neighbors are20 and19. node20 was colored1, node19 was colored0. So node35 must take color2. That's correct.\n\nSo perhaps the conflict is because node43's neighbors include both colors1 and2, making it impossible to color.\n\nBut according to the problem, a valid coloring exists. So I must have made a mistake in the coloring order.\n\nAlternative plan: Assign color0 to node43, but process it earlier. But since nodes are processed in order, node43 is processed after nodes0-42. So unless we change the processing order, which we can't, this approach won't work.\n\nAnother possibility: some of the colors assigned to neighbors of node43 can be changed to avoid having all three colors.\n\nFor example, if node33 is colored2 instead of1, then node43's neighbors would have colors0,0,0,2,0,2,0. So colors0 and2. Then node43 can be colored1.\n\nBut why wasn't node33 colored2?\n\nLooking back at node33's processing.\n\nNode33 is connected to42 (node42 is processed after node33?), 19 (color0),43 (unprocessed),11 (color0).\n\nWhen processing node33 (node33 is processed after nodes0-32, then node33 is node33):\n\nProcessed neighbors:19 (0),11 (0),42 (if processed). Wait, node42 is processed after node33 (since nodes are processed in order), so when node33 is being colored, node42 hasn't been processed yet. So node33's processed neighbors are19 (0),11 (0). So available colors are1 and2. We assigned1. But what if we assign2?\n\nLet's try that.\n\nReassign node33's color to2.\n\nThen, when processing node43, its neighbors are12 (0),38 (0),18 (0),35 (2),11 (0),33 (2),15 (0). So colors used are0 and2. Thus, node43 can be colored1.\n\nThis would resolve the conflict.\n\nBut why was node33 assigned1 in the initial processing?\n\nBecause when node33 was processed, its processed neighbors were19 (0) and11 (0). So the available colors were1 and2. The greedy algorithm picks the smallest available color, which is1. But if we instead choose2, then node43 can be colored1.\n\nThus, the mistake was in choosing color1 for node33. By choosing color2, we can enable node43 to be colored1.\n\nSo let's adjust node33's color to2.\n\nSo let's redo the steps, changing node33's color.\n\nProcessing node33:\n\nNode33 is connected to42 (unprocessed),19 (0),43 (unprocessed),11 (0). Processed neighbors:19 (0),11 (0). So colors used are0. Assign the smallest possible color, which is1. But wait, if we choose2 instead, that's allowed. But the greedy approach chooses1.\n\nAh, right. But if we violate the greedy approach and choose2 for node33, then node43 can be colored1. But how can we justify that within the processing order? The problem doesn't specify the order of coloring; it just requires a valid coloring. So perhaps a different order of processing would allow this.\n\nAlternatively, the issue is that the initial processing order leads to a conflict, but there exists a different valid coloring.\n\nLet me adjust the color of node33 to2 and see how it affects the rest.\n\nSo:\n\n...\n\nnode33: connected to19 (0),11 (0). Assign color2.\n\n...\n\nNow, proceed to node35:\n\nnode35: connected to20 (1),19 (0). Assign color2.\n\n...\n\nnode43's neighbors:12 (0),38 (0),18 (0),35 (2),11 (0),33 (2),15 (0). So colors are0 and2. Assign color1 to node43.\n\nNow, check if this creates any conflicts.\n\nAfter node43 is colored1:\n\nCheck its neighbors:\n\n-12 (0) is connected to43 (1) and22 (1). So that's okay.\n\n-38 (0) is connected to43 (1) and29 (1). So okay.\n\n-18 (0) is connected to43 (1) and20 (1). 20 is color1. 18 is0. So edge18-20:0 and1, which is okay.\n\n-35 (2) connected to43 (1): okay.\n\n-11 (0) connected to43 (1) and33 (2). So 11 is0, 33 is2: okay.\n\n-33 (2) connected to43 (1): okay.\n\n-15 (0) connected to43 (1) and32 (2): okay.\n\nThis seems valid. So changing node33's color to2 allows node43 to be colored1.\n\nBut why was node33's color changed to2? Because during processing, when node33 is being colored, the greedy algorithm picks the smallest available color not used by processed neighbors.\n\nProcessed neighbors of node33 are19 (0),11 (0). So available colors are1 and2. Assigning2 instead of1 would require a different approach, possibly a backtracking algorithm, but manually we can adjust this.\n\nTherefore, the mistake was in the initial assumption that node33 must be colored1. By changing it to2, the conflict is resolved.\n\nThus, the correct coloring would involve node33 being colored2.\n\nBut how to ensure this when coloring in order. If we can manually adjust this one color, the rest falls into place.\n\nNow, proceeding with the adjusted colors:\n\nFollowing this logic, let's reconstruct the coloring step by step, making sure node33 is colored2.\n\nRe-doing the coloring steps:\n\nNode0:0.\n\nNode1:0.\n\nNode2:0.\n\nNode3:1.\n\nNode4:0.\n\nNode5:0.\n\nNode6:0.\n\nNode7:2.\n\nNode8:0.\n\nNode9:1.\n\nNode10:0.\n\nNode11:0 (connected to43,33; but node43 and33 are unprocessed when processing node11. So node11 can be0.\n\nNode12:0.\n\nNode13:1.\n\nNode14:0.\n\nNode15:0.\n\nNode16:0.\n\nNode17:0.\n\nNode18:0.\n\nNode19:0.\n\nNode20:1.\n\nNode21:0.\n\nNode22:1.\n\nNode23:0.\n\nNode24:0.\n\nNode25:1.\n\nNode26:1.\n\nNode27:1.\n\nNode28:0.\n\nNode29:1.\n\nNode30:2.\n\nNode31:2.\n\nNode32:2.\n\nNode33:2 (since processed neighbors are19 (0) and11 (0), so assign2).\n\nNode34:0.\n\nNode35:2.\n\nNode36:0.\n\nNode37:1.\n\nNode38:0.\n\nNode39:0.\n\nNode40:1.\n\nNode41:2.\n\nNode42:0.\n\nNode43:1 (assigned now, with neighbors12 (0),38 (0),18 (0),35 (2),11 (0),33 (2),15 (0). Colors used are0 and2. So assign1).\n\nNode44:0 (assuming node44 exists and has no edges).\n\nWait, the nodes listed are up to45. The problem mentions nodes 0 to45, but the edges provided may not include all. Nodes44 and45: assuming they have no edges. So:\n\nNode44:0.\n\nNode45:0.\n\nNow, check for any conflicts.\n\nCheck node33 (color2). It's connected to42 (color0),19 (color0),43 (color1),11 (color0). So no conflicts.\n\nNode43 (color1) is connected to12 (0),38 (0),18 (0),35 (2),11 (0),33 (2),15 (0). All adjacent colors are different.\n\nNode35 (color2) is connected to20 (1),19 (0),43 (1). No conflicts.\n\nNode32 (color2) is connected to20 (1) and15 (0). No conflicts.\n\nNode30 (color2) is connected to0 (0),28 (0),17 (0),22 (1). No conflicts.\n\nNode22 (color1) is connected to0 (0),12 (0),30 (2). No conflicts.\n\nNode7 (color2) is connected to23 (0),20 (1),3 (1),2 (0),4 (0). All colors differ.\n\nNode3 (color1) is connected to0 (0),7 (2),31 (2). No conflicts.\n\nNode20 (color1) is connected to18 (0),7 (2),32 (2),35 (2),41 (2),17 (0). Wait, node41 is colored2. So node20 is1, connected to41 (2): okay.\n\nNode41 (color2) is connected to20 (1),24 (0),39 (0),34 (0). All colors differ.\n\nThus, this coloring seems valid.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that all nodes are assigned a color (0,1,2), and that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. Also, all three colors are used.\n\nLooking at the colors:\n\nColors used: 0 (many nodes), 1 (nodes3,9,13,20,22,25,26,27,29,43), 2 (nodes7,30,31,32,33,35,41). So all three colors are used.\n\nThus, this coloring is valid.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[4,0],[5,0],[6,0],[7,2],[8,0],[9,1],[10,0],[11,0],[12,0],[13,1],[14,0],[15,0],[16,0],[17,0],[18,0],[19,0],[20,1],[21,0],[22,1],[23,0],[24,0],[25,1],[26,1],[27,1],[28,0],[29,1],[30,2],[31,2],[32,2],[33,2],[34,0],[35,2],[36,0],[37,1],[38,0],[39,0],[40,1],[41,2],[42,0],[43,1],[44,0],[45,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

I need to color this graph with 3 colors. The nodes are from 0 to 42, so 43 nodes in total. The edges are listed here. My goal is to assign each node a color (0, 1, or 2) such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. And the output needs to be a list of [node, color] pairs for each node.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by understanding the structure of the graph. Let me list all the edges to see which nodes are connected. Let me go through each edge and note the connections.\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\n10-37, 1-37, 16-35, 7-26, 20-26, 21-25, 4-27, 19-21, 5-28, 10-18, 27-34, 4-42, 9-32, 30-33, 13-20, 19-33, 6-17, 26-29, 7-37, 18-37, 23-24, 3-21, 3-24, 8-14, 22-34, 8-23, 5-33, 1-14, 19-26, 8-38, 13-28, 11-34, 25-36, 18-24, 6-37, 4-19, 3-23, 29-39, 0-9, 14-26, 22-39, 11-12, 17-28, 19-40.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of edges. Let me see if there are any nodes with high degrees. Nodes connected to many others might be tricky. For example, node 37 is connected to 10, 1, 7, 18, 6, and 37's edges: 10,1,7,18,6. So node 37 has edges with 10,1,7,18,6. Wait, wait, looking at the edges:\n\n- 10-37\n- 1-37\n- 7-37\n- 18-37\n- 6-37\n- Then in another edge: 37's connected to these nodes. So node 37 has 5 edges? Let's count: edges where 37 is present: 10-37, 1-37, 7-37, 18-37, 6-37. That's five edges. So node 37 is connected to 10,1,7,18,6. So five connections.\n\nSimilarly, node 26 is connected to 7,20,19,14,29. Let's check the edges involving 26:\n\n7-26, 20-26, 19-26, 14-26, 26-29. So node 26 has five edges as well. So high-degree nodes like 26 and 37 might require careful coloring.\n\nAnother node: 19. Edges: 19-21, 19-33, 19-26, 4-19, 19-40. Also five edges. So 19 is connected to 21,33,26,4,40.\n\nSo the approach here is to assign colors in such a way that adjacent nodes don't clash. Since it's 3-colorable, maybe using a greedy algorithm approach. Start with the highest degree nodes first, assigning colors and then their neighbors, ensuring no conflicts.\n\nAlternatively, since it's possible that the graph is 3-colorable (since the problem states to use exactly 3 colors), perhaps a backtracking approach would work, but given the number of nodes, that's impractical manually.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to find an order of nodes and assign the smallest possible color not used by their neighbors.\n\nBut since I can't process this programmatically, I need to find a systematic way.\n\nLet me list all nodes and their connections, then try to assign colors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list all nodes from 0 to 42. Then for each node, list their neighbors.\n\nBut that's time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe group nodes that are connected, and see if there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a graph coloring strategy where I can partition the graph into three color groups where adjacent nodes are in different groups.\n\nBut given that this is a manual process, perhaps start by selecting a node and assign color 0, then assign colors to its neighbors as 1 and 2, proceeding step by step, ensuring no two adjacent have the same color.\n\nLet me pick node 37 first (high degree). Assign color 0. Then its neighbors (10,1,7,18,6) must be colors 1 or 2. Let's assign them alternately.\n\nBut I need to ensure that when assigning colors to these neighbors, their own neighbors don't conflict. Hmm, this could get complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a three-coloring approach where colors are assigned in a repeating pattern. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let's create three groups (colors 0,1,2) and place nodes in them, ensuring that no two in the same group are adjacent.\n\nBut without knowing the graph's structure, it's challenging. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nStart with node 37: color 0.\n\nNeighbors of 37: 10,1,7,18,6. Assign color 1 to 10, color 2 to 1, color 1 to 7, color 2 to 18, color 1 to 6. But need to check their other edges.\n\nFor example, node 10 is connected to 37 (color 0) and 18 (color 2). So node 10's color can't be 0. Let's assign color 1. Then node 18 is connected to 10 (color 1) and 37 (color 0). So node 18 can be color 2. Then node 18's other edges: 18 is connected to 24 (from edge 18-24). So when coloring node 24, it can't be the same as 18 (color 2). Hmm.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to process each node in an order, assigning the first available color that's not used by their already-colored neighbors.\n\nLet me try to create a list of nodes in some order (maybe sorted by degree descending) and process each in that order.\n\nNodes sorted by degree (approximate, since I don't have exact counts):\n\nLooking at the edges, nodes with multiple connections:\n\n37: connected to 10,1,7,18,6 (5 edges)\n\n26: connected to 7,20,19,14,29 (5 edges)\n\n19: connected to 21,33,26,4,40 (5 edges)\n\n14: connected to 8,1,26 (edges: 8-14, 1-14, 14-26)\n\n33: connected to 30,19,5, others? Let's see: edges 30-33, 19-33, 5-33.\n\n34: connected to 27,22,11 (edges: 27-34, 22-34, 11-34)\n\n23: connected to 24,3,8 (edges: 23-24, 3-24, 8-23?)\n\nWait, let's recheck edges:\n\nEdges include:\n\n3-21, 3-24, 8-23, 3-23? Let's see. The edges listed:\n\n3-21, 3-24, 8-23, 3-23? Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal edges:\n\n3 - 21\n\n3 - 24\n\n8 - 23\n\n3 - 23? Wait, the edges listed:\n\nLooking at the edge list:\n\nThe edges given are:\n\n3-21, 3-24, 8-23, 3-23 (if present). Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nEdges (format: NodeA - NodeB):\n\n...\n\n3 - 21\n\n3 - 24\n\n...\n\n8 - 23\n\n3 - 23\n\nAh, yes, there's an edge 3-23. So node 23 is connected to 24,3,8. So three edges.\n\nBut perhaps nodes like 26,37,19 have higher degrees.\n\nSo processing nodes in order of 37,26,19, etc.\n\nLet's start with node 37. Assign color 0.\n\nNeighbors of 37: 10,1,7,18,6. These must not be 0. Let's process them next.\n\nTake node 10 (connected to 37 and 18). Assign the smallest possible color not used by its colored neighbors. So 37 is color 0. So node 10 can be color 1.\n\nThen node 18 is connected to 37 (0) and 10 (1). So node 18 can be color 2.\n\nNext, node 1: connected to 37 (0) and 14. So assign color 1.\n\nNode 7: connected to 37 (0) and 26. Assign color 1.\n\nNode 6: connected to 37 (0) and 17. Assign color 1.\n\nThen proceed to their neighbors.\n\nNext, node 26: connected to 7 (color 1), 20,19,14,29.\n\nSo node 26 can't be color 1. Let's assign color 0.\n\nBut then node 26's neighbors: 7 (1), 20 (unknown), 19 (unknown), 14 (unknown), 29 (unknown).\n\nAssign color 0 to node 26.\n\nThen node 20 (connected to 26 (0) and 13). Assign color 1.\n\nNode 19 (connected to 26 (0), 21,33,4,40). Assign color 1.\n\nNode 14 (connected to 26 (0), 8, 1 (color 1)). So 14 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2.\n\nNode 29 (connected to 26 (0) and 39). Assign color 1.\n\nMoving on to node 19 (color 1). Its neighbors are 21,33,4,40.\n\nNode 21 is connected to 19 (1), 25,3. Assign color 0.\n\nNode 33 is connected to 19 (1),30,5. Assign color 0.\n\nNode 4 is connected to 19 (1),27,42. Assign color 0.\n\nNode 40 is connected to 19 (1). Assign color 0.\n\nNext, node 14 (color 2). Its neighbors are 8,1 (color 1), and 26 (0). So node 8 is connected to 14 (color 2) and 23, 38. So assign color 0 to node 8.\n\nNode 1 (color 1) is connected to 14 (color 2) and 37 (0). No issues.\n\nNode 20 (color 1) is connected to 26 (0) and 13. Assign color 0 to node 13.\n\nNode 13 is connected to 20 (color 1) and 28. Assign color 0. Then node 28 is connected to 13 (0),5,17. Assign color 1.\n\nNode 5 is connected to 28 (1) and 33 (color 0). So node 5's color can be 2.\n\nNode 33 (color 0) is connected to 30,19 (1),5 (2). Assign color 0 to 30.\n\nWait, node 30 is connected to 33 (0). Assign color 1 to 30.\n\nWait, node 30's color can't be 0 (since 33 is 0). So assign 1.\n\nThen node 30 (color 1) is connected to 33 (0). Okay.\n\nNow, node 4 (color 0) is connected to 27 and 42. Assign color 1 to 27.\n\nNode 27 is connected to 4 (0),34. Assign color 1. Then 34 is connected to 27 (1),22,11. Assign color 0 to 34.\n\nNode 34 (color 0) is connected to 27 (1),22,11. Assign color 0 to 34. Then nodes 22,11 must not be 0.\n\nNode 22 is connected to 34 (0) and 39. Assign color 1. Node 39 is connected to 22 (1) and 29 (color 1). Wait, node 29 is color 1 (from earlier). So node 39 can't be 1. Assign color 2 to 39.\n\nNode 11 is connected to 34 (0) and 12. Assign color 1. Node 12 is connected to 11 (1). Assign color 0.\n\nNode 25 is connected to 21 (0) and 36. Assign color 1. Node 36 is connected to 25 (1). Assign color 0.\n\nNode 3 is connected to 21 (0),24,23. Assign color 1. Node 24 is connected to 23 (color?), 18 (color 2), and 3 (1). Let's check node 23. Node 8 (color 0) is connected to 23. Node 3 (color 1) is connected to 23. So node 23's neighbors: 8 (0),3 (1), and 24. Assign color 2 to node 23. Then node 24 is connected to 23 (2),18 (2),3 (1). So node 24 can't be 2 or 1 (from 3), so color 0.\n\nWait, node 24's neighbors: 23 (color 2), 18 (color 2), 3 (color 1). So node 24 can't be 2 or 1. Then color 0. Assign color 0 to node 24.\n\nNow node 24's color is 0. Check if it conflicts with any neighbor. Node 18 (color 2) is connected to 24, so no conflict. Node 23 (color 2) connected to 24 (0), okay. Node 3 (color 1) connected to 24 (0), okay.\n\nNode 23's color is 2. Its neighbors: 8 (0), 3 (1), 24 (0). No conflict.\n\nNode 38 is connected to 8 (color 0). Assign color 1.\n\nNode 17 is connected to 6 (color 1) and 28 (color 1). Assign color 0.\n\nNode 28 (color 1) is connected to 5 (color 2), 13 (0), and 17 (0). So no conflict.\n\nNode 6's neighbors: 37 (0),17 (0). Wait, node 6 is color 1 (assigned earlier). 17 is color 0, so no conflict.\n\nNode 42 is connected to 4 (color 0). Assign color 1.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 0. Wait, edge 0-9. Assign color 1 to node 0. Then node 9 must be a different color. If node 0 is 1, node 9 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign node 9 to color 0.\n\nNode 32 is connected to 9 (color 0). Assign color 1.\n\nNow node 2: Wait, looking back at the nodes listed (0-42), I need to check if any nodes were missed. The nodes are from 0 to 42. So 43 nodes. Let me check if all have been colored.\n\nSo far, nodes colored:\n\n0: 1\n\n1:1?\n\nWait, no. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, node 1 was assigned color 1 (connected to 37 which is 0). Yes.\n\nNode 2: is there any edges connected to node 2? Let me check the edges again. The edges listed do not mention node 2. So node 2 has no edges. Therefore, can be colored with any color (0,1, or 2). Assign color 0.\n\nSimilarly, nodes like 12, 15, 35, etc., need to be checked.\n\nWait, let's go through all nodes from 0 to 42 and see if any were missed.\n\nNodes in the edges:\n\nThe edges include nodes up to 42, but let's list all nodes present in the edges:\n\nLooking at edges:\n\n10,37,1,16,35,7,26,20,21,25,4,27,19,5,28,10,18,27,34,42,9,32,30,33,13,19,6,17,29,7,37,18,23,24,3,8,14,22,34,8,23,3,24,8,38,5,33,1,14,26,22,39,11,12,17,28,19,40,0,9.\n\nWait, so node 2 is not in any edge. So node 2 is isolated. Therefore, can be assigned any color. Similarly, nodes 15, 31, 35, 36, etc.\n\nWait, let's list all nodes:\n\n0: in edge 0-9.\n\n1: in edges 1-37, 1-14.\n\n2: no edges.\n\n3: edges 3-21,3-24,3-23.\n\n4: edges 4-27,4-42,4-19.\n\n5: edges 5-28,5-33.\n\n6: edges 6-17,6-37.\n\n7: edges 7-26,7-37.\n\n8: edges 8-14,8-23,8-38.\n\n9: edges 9-32,0-9.\n\n10: edges 10-37,10-18.\n\n11: edges 11-34,11-12.\n\n12: edges 11-12.\n\n13: edges 13-20,13-28.\n\n14: edges 1-14,8-14,14-26.\n\n15: not in any edge.\n\n16: edge 16-35.\n\n17: edges 6-17,17-28.\n\n18: edges 10-18,18-37,18-24.\n\n19: edges 19-21,19-33,19-26,4-19,19-40.\n\n20: edges 20-26,13-20.\n\n21: edges 21-25,19-21,3-21.\n\n22: edges 22-34,22-39.\n\n23: edges 23-24,8-23,3-23.\n\n24: edges 23-24,3-24,18-24.\n\n25: edges 21-25,25-36.\n\n26: edges 7-26,20-26,19-26,14-26,26-29.\n\n27: edges 4-27,27-34.\n\n28: edges 5-28,13-28,17-28.\n\n29: edges 26-29,29-39.\n\n30: edges 30-33.\n\n31: not in any edge.\n\n32: edge 9-32.\n\n33: edges 30-33,19-33,5-33.\n\n34: edges 27-34,22-34,11-34.\n\n35: edge 16-35.\n\n36: edge 25-36.\n\n37: edges 10-37,1-37,7-37,18-37,6-37.\n\n38: edge 8-38.\n\n39: edges 29-39,22-39.\n\n40: edge 19-40.\n\n41: not in any edge.\n\n42: edge 4-42.\n\nWait, nodes 15, 31, 35, 36, etc.:\n\n- Node 15: no edges.\n\n- Node 16: edge 16-35. So node 16 is connected to 35.\n\n- Node 35: connected to 16. Wait, the edge is 16-35.\n\n- Node 36: connected to 25.\n\n- Node 31: no edges.\n\n- Node 41: no edges.\n\n- Node 42: connected to 4.\n\nSo node 2, 15, 31, 35, 36, 41 need to be considered.\n\nSo let's process these nodes:\n\nNode 35: connected to 16. Assign color to node 16 and 35.\n\nNode 16 is connected to 35. Assign color 0 to node 16. Then node 35 can be color 1.\n\nNode 36: connected to 25 (color 1). Assign color 0.\n\nNode 31: no edges, assign color 0.\n\nNode 15: no edges, assign color 0.\n\nNode 41: no edges, assign color 0.\n\nNode 2: no edges, assign color 0.\n\nNode 12: connected to 11 (color 1). Assign color 0.\n\nNode 32: connected to 9 (color 0). Assign color 1.\n\nNode 38: connected to 8 (color 0). Assign color 1.\n\nNode 40: connected to 19 (color 1). Assign color 0.\n\nNode 42: connected to 4 (color 0). Assign color 1.\n\nNode 39: connected to 29 (color 1) and 22 (color 1). Assign color 2. But earlier when processing node 39, we assigned it color 2, which is correct.\n\nNow, let's check if any conflicts exist. Let's verify a few nodes:\n\n- Node 37 (color 0) connected to 10 (1), 1 (1),7 (1),18 (2),6 (1). All different.\n\n- Node 26 (0) connected to 7 (1),20 (1),19 (1),14 (2),29 (1). All good.\n\n- Node 19 (1) connected to 21 (0), 33 (0),4 (0),40 (0). Good.\n\n- Node 8 (0) connected to 14 (2),23 (2),38 (1). All different.\n\n- Node 23 (2) connected to 8 (0),3 (1),24 (0). Correct.\n\n- Node 14 (2) connected to 8 (0),1 (1),26 (0). Correct.\n\n- Node 34 (0) connected to 27 (1),22 (1),11 (1). Correct.\n\n- Node 33 (0) connected to 30 (1),19 (1),5 (2). Correct.\n\n- Node 5 (2) connected to 28 (1),33 (0). Correct.\n\n- Node 28 (1) connected to 5 (2),13 (0),17 (0). Correct.\n\n- Node 17 (0) connected to 6 (1),28 (1). Correct.\n\n- Node 22 (1) connected to 34 (0),39 (2). Correct.\n\n- Node 39 (2) connected to 29 (1),22 (1). Correct.\n\n- Node 0 (1) connected to 9 (0). Correct.\n\n- Node 9 (0) connected to 0 (1),32 (1). Correct.\n\n- Node 32 (1) connected to 9 (0). Correct.\n\n- Node 16 (0) connected to 35 (1). Correct.\n\n- Node 35 (1) connected to 16 (0). Correct.\n\n- Node 25 (1) connected to 21 (0),36 (0). Correct.\n\n- Node 36 (0) connected to 25 (1). Correct.\n\n- Node 12 (0) connected to 11 (1). Correct.\n\n- Node 11 (1) connected to 34 (0),12 (0). Correct.\n\n- Node 38 (1) connected to 8 (0). Correct.\n\n- Node 42 (1) connected to 4 (0). Correct.\n\n- Node 40 (0) connected to 19 (1). Correct.\n\nNow, all nodes with edges have been checked. The isolated nodes (2,15,31,41) can be assigned any color. Let's assign them color 0.\n\nSo compiling all the color assignments:\n\n[0,1], [1,1], but wait, node 1 was assigned color 1 earlier.\n\nWait, let me list all nodes with their colors based on the steps:\n\n37:0\n\n10:1\n\n18:2\n\n1:1\n\n7:1\n\n6:1\n\n26:0\n\n20:1\n\n19:1\n\n14:2\n\n29:1\n\n21:0\n\n33:0\n\n4:0\n\n40:0\n\n8:0\n\n13:0\n\n28:1\n\n5:2\n\n30:1\n\n27:1\n\n34:0\n\n22:1\n\n39:2\n\n11:1\n\n12:0\n\n25:1\n\n36:0\n\n3:1\n\n23:2\n\n24:0\n\n38:1\n\n17:0\n\n0:1\n\n9:0\n\n32:1\n\n35:1\n\n16:0\n\n2:0\n\n15:0\n\n31:0\n\n41:0\n\n42:1\n\nNow, check for any duplicates in edges:\n\nWait, let's verify node 3. It has edges to 21 (0),24 (0),23 (2). Node 3's color is 1. So adjacent nodes are 21 (0),24 (0),23 (2). Correct.\n\nNode 3: color 1. Correct.\n\nNode 24: color 0. Connected to 18 (2),23 (2),3 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 23: color 2. Connected to 8 (0),3 (1),24 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 38: color 1. Connected to 8 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 17: color 0. Connected to 6 (1),28 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 0: color 1. Connected to 9 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 9: color 0. Connected to 0 (1),32 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 32: color 1. Connected to 9 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 35: color 1. Connected to 16 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 16: color 0. Connected to 35 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 36: color 0. Connected to 25 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 25: color 1. Connected to 21 (0),36 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 12: color 0. Connected to 11 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 11: color 1. Connected to 34 (0),12 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 42: color 1. Connected to 4 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 40: color 0. Connected to 19 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 31: color 0. No edges.\n\nNode 15: color 0. No edges.\n\nNode 2: color 0. No edges.\n\nNode 41: color 0. No edges.\n\nAll isolated nodes are colored 0. Since the problem allows using exactly 3 colors, it's acceptable to have some colors not used in the isolated nodes. But the problem states \"using exactly 3 colors\", which means the coloring must use all three colors. However, since the isolated nodes can be colored with any, but their color doesn't affect others. However, in this solution, we have colors 0,1,2 used. For example, nodes 18,39 are color 2. So the three colors are used.

Let's start by understanding the structure of the graph. First, I'll list out all the edges to see which nodes are connected.\n\nThe edges are given as pairs like 8-43, 0-39, etc. Let's parse them one by one and maybe create an adjacency list. That way, I can see which nodes are adjacent to each other and need different colors.\n\nStarting with the edges:\n\n8 is connected to 43, 21, 44. So node 8 is adjacent to 43,21,44.\n0 is connected to 39,23,32,43.\n6 is connected to 30,31,37.\n16 connected to 38,37,27.\n29-32.\n4 connected to 24,30,36.\n12-25.\n7-44,42.\n3-31,36.\n10-18,21,36.\n17-33.\n1-15,42,11,23.\n5-6,23,20.\n20-31.\n14-15.\n21-43,35,10.\n24-28,2.\n25-39.\n28-34.\n2-24,35.\nAnd others like 9-18, 23-41, 31-39, etc.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to approach this. Since we need to use 3 colors, maybe we can use a greedy approach, assigning colors in a way that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. But also, we need to ensure that the total colors used are exactly 3, so all three colors must be used somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check if the graph is 3-colorable. But given that the problem states to use exactly 3, perhaps the graph is 3-chromatic.\n\nLet me try to assign colors step by step. Let's pick a node and assign color 0, then check its neighbors and assign the next available color, and proceed.\n\nLet's start with node 0. Assign color 0. Then, its neighbors (39,23,32,43) can't be 0.\n\nNode 39: color 1? Then check its edges. 39 is connected to 0 (color 0) and 25, 31. So 25 and 31 can't be color 1 if 39 is 1. Let's assign 39 to 1.\n\nThen node 23 is connected to 0 (color0), 1,5. So 23 can't be 0. Let's assign color1 to node23. Wait, but node 1 is connected to 23. Let's check node1.\n\nNode1 is connected to 15,42,11,23. So when assigning color to node1, it can't be the same as 15,42,11,23. Let me first assign colors to nodes in order. Maybe pick a node order where high-degree nodes come first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Welsh-Powell algorithm, which orders nodes by descending degree and assigns colors accordingly.\n\nLet me try to calculate the degree of each node. Let's list all nodes and count their edges.\n\nNode0: connected to 39,23,32,43. Degree 4.\nNode1: 15,42,11,23. Degree4.\nNode2: 35,24. Degree2.\nNode3: 31,36. Degree2.\nNode4:24,30,36. Degree3.\nNode5:6,23,20. Degree3.\nNode6:30,31,37,5. Degree4.\nNode7:44,42. Degree2.\nNode8:43,21,44. Degree3.\nNode9:18. Degree1.\nNode10:18,21,36. Degree3.\nNode11:37,1. Degree2.\nNode12:25. Degree1.\nNode13: (no edges mentioned. Wait, original nodes are 0-44, so node13 is present. Let me check the edges again. The problem lists nodes from 0 to 44, so node13 exists, but in the edges provided, does node13 appear? Let me scan the edge list again: looking for 13 in the edges. The edges provided are:\n\n8 - 43, 0 - 39, 6 - 30, 16 - 38, 29 - 32, 4 - 24, 12 - 25, 7 - 44, 21 - 43, 3 - 31, 8 - 21, 4 - 30, 10 - 18, 4 - 36, 17 - 33, 0 - 23, 10 - 21, 1 - 15, 0 - 32, 10 - 36, 2 - 35, 1 - 42, 5 - 6, 16 - 37, 14 - 15, 20 - 31, 1 - 11, 3 - 36, 1 - 23, 24 - 28, 8 - 44, 11 - 37, 16 - 27, 0 - 43, 25 - 39, 6 - 31, 6 - 37, 7 - 42, 21 - 35, 31 - 39, 5 - 23, 5 - 20, 9 - 18, 23 - 41, 28 - 34, 2 - 24.\n\nSo node13 is not connected to any others. So node13 can be colored any color. Similarly, nodes like 9 (connected to 18), 12 (connected to 25), 17 (connected to 33), etc. So nodes with degree 0 or 1 might be easier.\n\nSo in the list, node13 is isolated. So its color doesn't affect others. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nBut back to the approach. Let's order nodes by descending degree. Let's list degrees:\n\nNode0:4 edges\nNode1:4 edges\nNode6:4 edges\nNode5:3 edges (connected to 6,23,20)\nNode4:3 edges (24,30,36)\nNode8:3 edges (43,21,44)\nNode10:3 edges (18,21,36)\nNode16:3 edges (38,37,27)\nNode21:3 edges (43,8,10,35) Wait, edges for 21 are 43,8,10,35? Let's check. Original edges:\n\n21-43, 8-21, 10-21, 21-35. So node21 has 4 edges. So degree 4.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nFor node8: edges 8-43,8-21,8-44. So three edges. Degree3.\n\nNode21: connected to 43,8,10,35. Yes, four edges. So node21's degree is4.\n\nSimilarly, node31 is connected to 3,20,6,39. Let's check: 3-31, 20-31, 6-31, 31-39. So four edges. Degree4.\n\nSimilarly, node23: connected to 0,1,5,41. Edges: 0-23,1-23,5-23,23-41. Degree4.\n\nNode5: edges 5-6,5-23,5-20. So three edges.\n\nSo nodes with degree4:\n\n0,1,6,21,23,31.\n\nThen degree3: nodes4,5,8,10,16, others?\n\nNode25: connected to 12,39. Degree2.\n\nWait, let me go through each node's degree. This might take a while but is necessary for the ordering.\n\nNode0: 4 edges (39,23,32,43)\nNode1: connected to 15,42,11,23 (4 edges)\nNode2: 35,24 (2)\nNode3:31,36 (2)\nNode4:24,30,36 (3)\nNode5:6,23,20 (3)\nNode6:30,31,37,5 (4)\nNode7:44,42 (2)\nNode8:43,21,44 (3)\nNode9:18 (1)\nNode10:18,21,36 (3)\nNode11:37,1 (2)\nNode12:25 (1)\nNode13: none (0)\nNode14:15 (1)\nNode15:1,14 (2)\nNode16:38,37,27 (3)\nNode17:33 (1)\nNode18:10,9 (2)\nNode19: none (0) (Wait, original nodes go up to 44. The edges don't mention node19. So node19 is isolated.)\nWait, but in the problem statement, the nodes are listed as 0 to 44. The edges provided are as per the list. So nodes 13,19, etc., are present but with no edges. So their degree is 0. So nodes 13,19,22, etc. (need to check which nodes are in 0-44 but not in edges. Let me list all nodes:\n\nOriginal nodes: 0-44, so 45 nodes. The edges given have nodes up to 44. Wait, the edges include 8-44, 7-44, etc. So 44 is present. Let me check which nodes are not in any edges:\n\nLooking at the list of nodes from 0 to 44, check each one against the edges:\n\nFor example:\n\nNode0: yes.\nNode1: yes.\n...\nWait, this is time-consuming. But perhaps the key high-degree nodes are the ones I mentioned. So nodes like 0,1,6,21,23,31 have degree 4. So in the ordering, these would come first.\n\nSo, applying Welsh-Powell, order the nodes in descending order of degree. Then assign colors in that order.\n\nThe sorted list (highest degree first) would be:\n\nNodes with degree4: 0,1,6,21,23,31.\n\nThen degree3:4,5,8,10,16.\n\nThen degree2: 2,3,7,11,15,18,20,24,28,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,41,42,43,44. Wait, some nodes might have higher degrees. Let me check node32: connected to 29,0. Degree2. Node39: connected to 0,25,31. So three edges. So node39 has degree3.\n\nWait, let me check nodes again. For example, node36 is connected to 4,10,3. So three edges. So node36 has degree3. So nodes4,5,8,10,16,36,39 have degree3.\n\nSo perhaps the order is:\n\nDegree4: 0,1,6,21,23,31\n\nDegree3:4,5,8,10,16,36,39\n\nThen degree2, etc.\n\nOnce ordered, assign the lowest possible color not used by adjacent nodes.\n\nLet me start with the highest degree nodes.\n\nFirst, node0. Assign color0.\n\nAdjacent nodes:39,23,32,43. So these cannot be color0.\n\nNext node in order: node1. Assign color0? But wait, node1's adjacent nodes are 15,42,11,23. None of these are colored yet. So can node1 be color0? Wait, but node23 is adjacent to node1. Node23 hasn't been colored yet. So yes, node1 can take color0. But then, node23 is adjacent to node0 (color0) and node1 (color0). So when we get to node23, it can't be color0. Let's proceed.\n\nAssign color0 to node1. Wait, but node1 is connected to 15,42,11,23. If we color node1 as 0, then those nodes must not be 0 when they are processed. But perhaps better to assign different colors early on to avoid conflicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps start with node0: color0.\n\nNext, node1. Can't be color0 (if adjacent to node0's color?), but node0 and node1 are not adjacent. Wait, the edges: node0 is connected to 39,23,32,43. Node1 is connected to 15,42,11,23. So node0 and node1 are not directly connected. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, node0 is connected to node23. Node1 is connected to node23. So node0 and node1 are not directly connected. So their colors can be the same. Wait, no, they are not connected. So node0 and node1 can have the same color. But node1 is connected to node23, which is connected to node0. So node1 and node23 are connected. So node23 can't have the same color as node1. But node23 is adjacent to node0 (color0) and node1 (could be color0). So node23 cannot be color0. But let's see.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nNode0: color0.\n\nNode1: next in order. Assign color0. Because node1 is not connected to node0. So possible. Then its adjacent nodes (15,42,11,23) can't be 0.\n\nNext node in order: node6. Assign the lowest color not used by its adjacent nodes. Node6 is connected to 30,31,37,5. None of these are colored yet. Assign color0. But wait, node6's adjacent nodes: but none have been colored yet. So assign color0. Then 30,31,37,5 can't be 0.\n\nNext node: node21. Adjacent to 43,8,10,35. None colored. Assign color0. Then adjacent nodes 43,8,10,35 can't be 0.\n\nThen node23. Connected to 0 (color0), 1 (color0), 5,41. So can't be 0. Assign the next color, 1.\n\nThen node31. Adjacent to 3,20,6 (color0), 39. So node6 is color0. Assign color1. But check other neighbors (3,20,39). Not colored yet. So color1 is possible.\n\nNow, moving to degree3 nodes.\n\nNode4: connected to 24,30,36. None colored. Assign color0. But wait, node4's adjacent nodes (24,30,36) can't be 0. So 24,30,36 must have colors different from 0.\n\nNode5: connected to 6 (color0),23 (color1),20. Can't be 0 or 1. So assign color2.\n\nNode8: connected to 43 (must not be color0 if 21 is color0?), wait node8 is connected to 43,21 (color0), 44. So node8's adjacent nodes 43,21 (color0), 44. So node8 can't be color0. Assign color1.\n\nNode10: connected to 18,21 (color0), 36. Can't be color0. Assign color1.\n\nNode16: connected to38,37,27. None colored. Assign color0.\n\nNode36: connected to4 (color0),10 (color1),3. Can't be 0 or 1. Assign color2.\n\nNode39: connected to0 (color0),25,31 (color1). Can't be 0 or 1. Assign color2.\n\nNow, moving to lower degree nodes.\n\nBut this process is getting complicated. Let me check conflicts as I go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using backtracking is better, but given the size, maybe not. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, nodes with degree3 assigned. Next, nodes with degree2.\n\nBut perhaps I should list out the colors step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to create an adjacency list, then iterate through each node, assigning the first available color not used by its neighbors.\n\nBut this requires keeping track of all neighbors' colors, which may not be feasible manually, but let's try.\n\nStart with node0: color0.\n\nAdjacent nodes (39,23,32,43) can't be 0.\n\nNow, node1: not adjacent to 0. So color0.\n\nAdjacent nodes (15,42,11,23) can't be 0.\n\nNext, node6: adjacent to30,31,37,5. Assign color0. So 30,31,37,5 can't be 0.\n\nNode21: adjacent to43,8,10,35. Assign color0. So these nodes can't be 0.\n\nNode23: adjacent to0 (0),1 (0),5,41. Can't be 0. Assign color1.\n\nNode31: adjacent to3,20,6 (0),39. Assign color1.\n\nNow, node4: adjacent to24,30,36. Assign color0.\n\nNode5: adjacent to6 (0),23 (1),20. So can't be 0 or 1. Assign color2.\n\nNode8: adjacent to43 (must check if 43's color is set. 43 is adjacent to8,0,21 (0). So node43 is adjacent to 0 (color0), 8,21 (color0). So 43 can't be 0. Assign color1. But node8's color is being decided now. Wait, node8 is connected to43 (which hasn't been colored yet),21 (color0),44. So node8 can't be 0. Assign color1. Then node43 and 44 will have to avoid color1.\n\nNode10: adjacent to18,21 (0),36. Assign color1.\n\nNode16: adjacent to38,37,27. Assign color0.\n\nNode36: adjacent to4 (0),10 (1),3. Assign color2.\n\nNode39: adjacent to0 (0),25,31 (1). Assign color2.\n\nNow, moving to degree2 nodes. Let's process node2: connected to35,24. Assign color0. Check neighbors. 35 and 24 aren't colored yet. So node2 can be 0. Then 35 and 24 can't be 0.\n\nNode3: connected to31 (1),36 (2). Assign color0. Since 31 is 1, 36 is 2. So color0 is allowed.\n\nNode7: connected to44,42. Assign color0. Then 44 and 42 can't be 0.\n\nNode9: connected to18. Assign color0. Then 18 can't be 0.\n\nNode11: connected to37,1 (0). Assign color1. Because 1 is color0. So node11 can take color1. Then 37 can't be 1.\n\nNode12: connected to25. Assign color0. Then 25 can't be 0.\n\nNode13: no edges. Assign color0.\n\nNode14: connected to15. Assign color0. Then 15 can't be 0.\n\nNode15: connected to1 (0),14 (0). Can't be 0. Assign color1.\n\nNode17: connected to33. Assign color0.\n\nNode18: connected to10 (1),9 (0). Assign color2. Because 10 is 1 and 9 is 0. So 18 can take 2.\n\nNode19: no edges. Assign color0.\n\nNode20: connected to31 (1),5 (2). Assign color0. Wait, 31 is 1 and 5 is 2. So node20 can be 0.\n\nNode22: no edges. Assign color0.\n\nNode24: connected to4 (0),2 (0),28. Can't be 0. Assign color1. Then node28 can't be 1.\n\nNode25: connected to12 (0),39 (2). Assign color1. Because 12 is 0 and 39 is 2. So 1 is available.\n\nNode26: no edges. Assign color0.\n\nNode27: connected to16 (0). Assign color1.\n\nNode28: connected to24 (1),34. Assign color0. Since 24 is 1, node28 can be 0. Then 34 can't be 0.\n\nNode29: connected to32. Assign color0. Then node32 can't be 0.\n\nNode30: connected to4 (0),6 (0), etc. Assign color1 (can't be 0). But node30 is adjacent to4 (color0) and 6 (color0). So node30 can take color1.\n\nNode32: connected to0 (0),29 (0). Assign color1. Because 0 is 0 and 29 is 0. So node32 can be 1.\n\nNode33: connected to17 (0). Assign color1.\n\nNode34: connected to28 (0). Assign color1.\n\nNode35: connected to2 (0),21 (0). Assign color1. Then node35's neighbors (21 is color0) so color1 is okay.\n\nNode37: connected to6 (0),16 (0),11 (1). Assign color2. Because 6 and 16 are 0, and 11 is 1. So color2 is available.\n\nNode38: connected to16 (0). Assign color1.\n\nNode40: no edges. Assign color0.\n\nNode41: connected to23 (1). Assign color0. Because 23 is 1. So 0 is allowed.\n\nNode42: connected to1 (0),7 (0). Assign color1. Because 1 and 7 are 0. So color1 is available.\n\nNode43: connected to0 (0),8 (1),21 (0). So neighbors are 0 (0),8 (1),21 (0). So node43 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color2.\n\nNode44: connected to8 (1),7 (0). Assign color2. Because 8 is 1 and 7 is 0. So 2 is available.\n\nNow, check if all nodes are colored and no adjacent nodes have the same color.\n\nLet me verify some key nodes:\n\nNode0:0. Adjacent to 39 (2),23 (1),32 (1),43 (2). All different.\n\nNode1:0. Adjacent to15 (1),42 (1),11 (1),23 (1). Wait, all adjacent nodes to node1 are assigned 1. So node1's color is 0, which is okay. Because none of its neighbors are 0. So that's correct.\n\nNode6:0. Adjacent to30 (1),31 (1),37 (2),5 (2). All different.\n\nNode21:0. Adjacent to43 (2),8 (1),10 (1),35 (1). All different.\n\nNode23:1. Adjacent to0 (0),1 (0),5 (2),41 (0). All different except 0 and 0? Wait, node23's adjacent nodes are 0 (0),1 (0),5 (2),41 (0). So node23 is color1, which is different from all. Correct.\n\nNode31:1. Adjacent to3 (0),20 (0),6 (0),39 (2). All different.\n\nNode5:2. Adjacent to6 (0),23 (1),20 (0). Correct.\n\nNode8:1. Adjacent to43 (2),21 (0),44 (2). Wait, 43 and 44 are both 2. So node8 is 1, which is okay. Because they are adjacent, but node8's color is 1, and 43 and 44 are 2, so no conflict. Correct.\n\nNode43:2. Adjacent to0 (0),8 (1),21 (0). Correct.\n\nNode44:2. Adjacent to8 (1),7 (0). Correct.\n\nNode42:1. Adjacent to1 (0),7 (0). Correct.\n\nNode36:2. Adjacent to4 (0),10 (1),3 (0). Correct.\n\nNode39:2. Adjacent to0 (0),25 (1),31 (1). Correct.\n\nNode30:1. Adjacent to4 (0),6 (0). Correct.\n\nNode32:1. Adjacent to0 (0),29 (0). Correct.\n\nThis seems okay. Now, check isolated nodes like 13,19,22, etc. They are colored 0. Since they have no edges, any color is fine, but since we need exactly 3 colors, we need to ensure that colors 0,1,2 are all used. Let's check:\n\nColors used:\n\n0: many nodes (0,1,6, etc.)\n\n1:23,31,8,10, etc.\n\n2:5,36,39,37,43,44, etc.\n\nYes, all three colors are used.\n\nThus, the coloring seems valid.

So, the task is to assign colors to each node using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2) such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. Let me start by understanding the structure of the graph.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges given. Let's parse them one by one to see which nodes are connected. The edges are:\n0-30, 25-29, 16-20, 6-24, 12-19, 5-7, 3-16, 0-2, 12-25, 0-5, 4-24, 11-17, 13-20, 13-26, 18-22, 7-28, 12-15, 5-12, 9-16, 5-15, 8-17, 8-23, 9-28, 15-22, 15-28, 6-28, 17-28, 2-18, 11-24, 10-22.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of edges. Let me try to visualize or group some of these nodes to see if there are any clusters or high-degree nodes that might need special attention.\n\nLooking at the edges, some nodes appear multiple times. For example, node 12 is connected to 19, 25, 15, and 5. Node 5 is connected to 7, 0, 12, 15. Node 15 is connected to 12, 5, 22, 28. Node 28 is connected to 7, 9, 15, 6, 17, and others. These nodes have several connections, so they might be central points that require careful color assignment to avoid conflicts.\n\nSince we need to use exactly 3 colors, I'll start by assigning colors in a way that alternates between them, ensuring that adjacent nodes don't share the same color. Let's start with node 0. Let's assign color 0 to node 0. Then its adjacent nodes (30, 2, 5) can't be color 0. Let's choose color 1 for node 30, color 2 for node 2, and color 1 for node 5. Wait, but node 5 is connected to node 0 (color 0) and others. Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to process nodes in order, checking their neighbors and assigning the first available color that's not used by adjacent nodes. Let's try that.\n\nAlternatively, since this graph might have a particular structure, perhaps it's bipartite or can be divided into three parts. But since we need exactly 3 colors, it's possible the graph isn't bipartite, hence requiring three.\n\nLet me list all nodes and their neighbors to track possible colors.\n\nStarting with node 0:\nNeighbors: 30, 2, 5. Assign color 0 to node 0. Then those three must be 1 or 2.\n\nNext, node 1: Wait, the nodes given are 0 through 30. But looking at the edges, some nodes might not be present. Wait, the nodes listed are 0 to 30, but in the problem statement, the nodes are 0,1,2,...,30. So all 31 nodes are present. Let's confirm. The list says: Nodes: 0, 1, ...,30. So 31 nodes total. But the edges may not include all. So each node is present, but some may have no edges. But we have to color all of them.\n\nBut perhaps some nodes aren't connected to any other nodes. For example, node 1 doesn't appear in any edge. Let me check. Looking through the edges:\n\nLooking for node 1: The edges listed are 0-30, 25-29, etc. Node 1 is not in any edge. So node 1 is isolated. So its color can be 0, 1, or 2. Similarly, nodes like 14, maybe 21, etc., might not be connected. Wait, let's check each node.\n\nWait, let's check which nodes are in the edges:\n\nEdges:\n\n0-30,\n\n25-29,\n\n16-20,\n\n6-24,\n\n12-19,\n\n5-7,\n\n3-16,\n\n0-2,\n\n12-25,\n\n0-5,\n\n4-24,\n\n11-17,\n\n13-20,\n\n13-26,\n\n18-22,\n\n7-28,\n\n12-15,\n\n5-12,\n\n9-16,\n\n5-15,\n\n8-17,\n\n8-23,\n\n9-28,\n\n15-22,\n\n15-28,\n\n6-28,\n\n17-28,\n\n2-18,\n\n11-24,\n\n10-22.\n\nSo nodes involved in edges are:\n\n0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,17,18,19,20,22,23,24,25,26,28,29,30.\n\nNodes not in any edge: 1, 14, 21, 27, and maybe others? Let me see:\n\nWait, nodes 0-30, which is 31 nodes. Let's list all nodes and see which are in the edges:\n\n0: yes\n\n1: no\n\n2: yes\n\n3: yes\n\n4: yes\n\n5: yes\n\n6: yes\n\n7: yes\n\n8: yes\n\n9: yes\n\n10: yes\n\n11: yes\n\n12: yes\n\n13: yes\n\n14: no\n\n15: yes\n\n16: yes\n\n17: yes\n\n18: yes\n\n19: yes\n\n20: yes\n\n21: no\n\n22: yes\n\n23: yes\n\n24: yes\n\n25: yes\n\n26: yes\n\n27: no\n\n28: yes\n\n29: yes\n\n30: yes\n\nSo nodes 1,14,21,27 are not connected to any other nodes. So they can be colored with any color. But since the problem requires exactly 3 colors, but since they are isolated, they can be assigned any of the three colors, perhaps 0 for simplicity.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, handle the connected components. The isolated nodes can be colored with any color. Let's assign them color 0 for simplicity.\n\nNow, let's focus on the connected nodes.\n\nFirst, let's look at the node with the highest degree to manage constraints. For example, node 28 is connected to 7,9,15,6,17, and possibly others. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\n7-28,\n\n9-28,\n\n15-28,\n\n6-28,\n\n17-28,\n\nAlso, in 12-15, 15-22, 15-28, etc. So node 15 is connected to 12,5,22,28. So node 15 has degree 4.\n\nSimilarly, node 12 is connected to 19,25,15,5. Node 5 is connected to 0,7,12,15. Node 28's neighbors: 7,9,15,6,17, and possibly others? Let's check all edges mentioning 28:\n\nEdges involving 28: 7-28,9-28,15-28,6-28,17-28. So node 28 has 5 neighbors: 7,9,15,6,17.\n\nSo node 28 has degree 5, which is high. Assigning a color to 28 requires that all these five nodes have different colors. Wait, but since we're using three colors, some of those neighbors can share the same color as long as they are not connected to each other. But since they are all connected to 28, they can't share the same color as 28 but can share among themselves if they are not connected.\n\nWait, the neighbors of 28 are 7,9,15,6,17. Are any of these nodes connected to each other? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\n- 7 is connected to 5 and 28.\n\n- 9 is connected to 16 and 28.\n\n- 15 is connected to 12,5,22,28.\n\n- 6 is connected to 24 and 28.\n\n- 17 is connected to 11,8,28.\n\nSo, the neighbors of 28 (7,9,15,6,17) are not directly connected to each other (as per the edges given), except perhaps through other nodes. For example, 15 is connected to 5, which is connected to 0, etc. But in terms of direct edges among the neighbors of 28, there don't seem to be any. So, each of these nodes (7,9,15,6,17) are adjacent to 28 but not to each other. Therefore, we can color them with any colors except the color of 28. Since they are not connected to each other, they can share the same color. However, since there are five nodes, but we have only three colors, we need to assign colors such that each is different from their own neighbors.\n\nWait, but each of these nodes (7,9,15,6,17) may have their own neighbors that impose constraints. For example, node 7 is connected to 5 and 28. Node 5 is connected to 0,7,12,15. So, 7's color must be different from 5 and 28. Similarly, 9's color must be different from 16 and 28. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's approach this step by step.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to pick an order of nodes and assign colors in a greedy way, choosing the first available color that doesn't conflict with already colored neighbors.\n\nLet's choose the order based on the node degrees, starting with the highest degree nodes first. Let's list the degrees:\n\nCalculate the degree for each node:\n\n- Node 0: edges to 30, 2, 5 → degree 3\n\n- Node 5: edges to 0,7,12,15 → degree 4\n\n- Node 12: edges to 19,25,15,5 → degree 4\n\n- Node 15: edges to 12,5,22,28 → degree 4\n\n- Node 28: edges to 7,9,15,6,17 → degree 5 (highest)\n\n- Node 7: edges to 5,28 → degree 2\n\n- Node 9: edges to 16,28 → degree 2\n\n- Node 16: edges to 20,3,9 → degree 3\n\n- Node 17: edges to 11,8,28 → degree 3\n\n- Node 6: edges to 24,28 → degree 2\n\n- Node 25: edges to 29,12 → degree 2\n\n- Node 22: edges to 18,15,10 → degree 3\n\n- Node 24: edges to 6,4,11 → degree 3\n\n- Node 8: edges to 17,23 → degree 2\n\n- Node 11: edges to 17,24 → degree 2\n\n- Node 13: edges to 20,26 → degree 2\n\n- Node 3: edge to 16 → degree 1\n\n- Node 4: edge to 24 → degree 1\n\n- Node 10: edge to 22 → degree 1\n\n- Node 18: edges to 2,22 → degree 2\n\n- Node 2: edges to 0,18 → degree 2\n\n- Node 19: edge to 12 → degree 1\n\n- Node 20: edges to 16,13 → degree 2\n\n- Node 23: edge to 8 → degree 1\n\n- Node 26: edge to 13 → degree 1\n\n- Node 29: edge to 25 → degree 1\n\n- Node 30: edge to 0 → degree 1\n\nOthers (like 1,14,21,27) have degree 0.\n\nSo node 28 has the highest degree (5), followed by nodes 5,12,15 (degree 4 each). Let's process them first.\n\nLet's start with node 28. Assign color 0. Then its neighbors (7,9,15,6,17) cannot be 0.\n\nNext, process node 5 (degree 4). Its neighbors are 0,7,12,15. Node 0's color hasn't been assigned yet. Wait, perhaps processing nodes in the order of 28, then 5, then 12, then 15, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start by assigning color 0 to node 28. Then assign colors to its neighbors.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use a backtracking algorithm, but since this is a thought process, I'll proceed step by step.\n\nLet's proceed in the order of highest degree first.\n\n1. Node 28: color 0.\n\nThen, its neighbors (7,9,15,6,17) must not be 0.\n\n2. Next, process node 15 (degree 4). Its neighbors are 12,5,22,28. Node 28 is color 0, so 15 can't be 0. Assign color 1 to node 15. Now, its neighbors (12,5,22) must not be 1.\n\n3. Node 5 (degree 4): neighbors 0,7,12,15. 15 is color 1, so 5 can't be 1. Assign color 0. But wait, node 28 is color 0. Wait, node 5's neighbors don't include 28. So 5 can be color 0. But node 0 is connected to 5. If node 0 is yet to be colored, so if we assign color 0 to 5, then node 0 can't be 0. Let's proceed.\n\nAssign color 0 to node 5. Then, node 0 (connected to 5) can't be 0. Also, node 7 (connected to 5) can't be 0. Node 12 (connected to 5) can't be 0. Node 15 is already 1, so no conflict.\n\n4. Node 12 (degree 4): neighbors 19,25,15,5. 15 is 1, 5 is 0. Assign color 2. So 12 is 2. Now, neighbors (19,25,15,5) must not be 2. 15 is 1, 5 is 0; 19 and 25 need to be colored differently if they are connected to others.\n\n5. Node 0 (degree 3): neighbors 30,2,5. 5 is color 0, so 0 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Now node 0 is color 1. Then 30,2 must not be 1.\n\n6. Node 30 (edge to 0): color can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\n7. Node 2 (edge to 0 and 18): can't be 1. Assign 0. But node 18 is connected to 2. Node 18's color can't be 0.\n\n8. Node 7 (connected to 5 and 28): 5 is 0, 28 is 0. So 7 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Then node 7 is 1.\n\n9. Node 9 (connected to 16 and 28): 28 is 0. Assign color 1. Then 16 must not be 1.\n\n10. Node 16 (connected to 20,3,9): 9 is 1. Assign color 0. Then 20 and 3 can't be 0.\n\n11. Node 3 (connected to 16): 16 is 0. Assign 1.\n\n12. Node 20 (connected to 16 and 13): 16 is 0. Assign 1. Then 13 (connected to 20) can't be 1.\n\n13. Node 13 (connected to 20 and 26): 20 is 1. Assign 0. Then 26 can't be 0.\n\n14. Node 26 (connected to 13): 13 is 0. Assign 1.\n\n15. Node 6 (connected to 24 and 28): 28 is 0. Assign 1. Then 24 can't be 1.\n\n16. Node 24 (connected to 6,4,11): 6 is 1. Assign 0. Then 4 and 11 can't be 0.\n\n17. Node 4 (connected to 24): 24 is 0. Assign 1.\n\n18. Node 11 (connected to 24 and 17): 24 is 0. Assign 1. Then 17 can't be 1.\n\n19. Node 17 (connected to 11,8,28): 11 is 1, 28 is 0. Assign 2. Then 8 can't be 2.\n\n20. Node 8 (connected to 17 and 23): 17 is 2. Assign 0. Then 23 can't be 0.\n\n21. Node 23 (connected to 8): 8 is 0. Assign 1.\n\n22. Node 22 (connected to 18,15,10): 15 is 1. Assign 0. Then 18 and 10 can't be 0.\n\n23. Node 18 (connected to 2 and 22): 2 is 0, 22 is 0. So 18 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\n24. Node 10 (connected to 22): 22 is 0. Assign 1.\n\n25. Node 25 (connected to 29 and 12): 12 is 2. Assign 0. Then 29 can't be 0.\n\n26. Node 29 (connected to 25): 25 is 0. Assign 1.\n\n27. Node 19 (connected to 12): 12 is 2. Assign 0.\n\nNow, check for any remaining nodes:\n\nNodes not yet assigned:\n\n- Node 1: isolated. Assign 0.\n\n- Node 14: isolated. Assign 0.\n\n- Node 21: isolated. Assign 0.\n\n- Node 27: isolated. Assign 0.\n\nNow, let's check for any conflicts.\n\nCheck node 5's neighbors: 0 (1), 7 (1), 12 (2), 15 (1). Node 5 is 0. Correct, since neighbors are different.\n\nCheck node 28's neighbors: 7 (1),9 (1),15 (1),6 (1),17 (2). All not 0. Correct.\n\nCheck node 15's neighbors: 12 (2),5 (0),22 (0),28 (0). Node 15 is 1. Correct.\n\nCheck node 12's neighbors: 19 (0),25 (0),15 (1),5 (0). Node 12 is 2. Correct.\n\nCheck node 0's neighbors: 30 (0),2 (0),5 (0). Wait, node 0 is color 1. Its neighbors 30,2,5. But 30 is 0, 2 is 0, 5 is 0. All different from 1. Correct.\n\nCheck node 7: color 1. Neighbors 5 (0) and 28 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 9: color 1. Neighbors 16 (0) and 28 (0).

Correct.\n\nIsolated nodes (1,14,21,27) can all be 0 with no issues.\n\nNow, let's check all edges to ensure no two connected nodes have the same color.\n\nLet me check a few more:\n\n- Node 2 (0) connected to 18 (1).

I need to assign colors to 48 nodes using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2), such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. Let's start by understanding the structure of the graph based on the edges provided.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges to see which nodes are connected. Maybe creating an adjacency list would help. Let me go through each edge and note the connections.\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\n27-47, 13-30, 2-33, 19-46, 13-39, 29-38, 39-42, 40-47, 23-40, 14-37, 36-37, 8-21, 28-33, 3-40, 4-45, 17-39, 17-45, 19-39, 26-32, 2-32, 0-41, 13-47, 6-35, 18-34, 4-26, 5-15, 0-4, 9-13, 9-28, 1-20, 36-45, 17-41, 28-41, 27-45, 18-24, 3-5, 32-41, 0-46, 6-43, 22-33, 23-32, 23-41, 1-10, 14-44, 2-18, 6-9, 1-22.\n\nHmm, that's a lot. Maybe I can start by assigning colors step by step, ensuring that each node's color is different from its neighbors. Since it's a 3-coloring problem, I can use a greedy approach, choosing the smallest available color that hasn't been used by adjacent nodes.\n\nLet me pick a starting node. Let's look at node 0. Its edges are 0-41, 0-4, 0-46. So node 0 is connected to 41, 4, 46. Let's assign color 0 to node 0. Then, nodes 41,4,46 must be different. Let's see:\n\nBut maybe starting with node 0, assign color 0. Then nodes 4,41,46 can't be 0. Let's proceed.\n\nNode 0: color 0.\n\nNow, node 4 is connected to 0, so color can't be 0. Also, node 4 is connected to 45, 26, 45 again (from edges 4-45 and 4-26). So when I color node 4, I need to avoid colors of 0, and also its other neighbors once they are colored.\n\nBut perhaps proceed step by step. Let's process nodes in order from 0 to 47.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to process nodes with higher degrees first, but without the degree information, perhaps ordering them as per their connections.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use backtracking, but since the graph might be complex, perhaps a heuristic approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, let's build an adjacency list for each node, then assign colors in a way that avoids conflicts.\n\nLet me list each node and their neighbors:\n\nNode 0: 41,4,46\nNode 1: 20,10,22\nNode 2: 33,32,18\nNode 3: 40,5\nNode 4: 45,26,0\nNode 5: 15,3\nNode 6: 35,43,9\nNode 7: (no edges listed)\nWait, the nodes go up to 47. Wait, the problem statement lists nodes 0 to 47, but in the edges given, I need to check if all nodes are included. For example, node 7 doesn't appear in any edge. So node 7 has no edges. So its color can be any color, but since exactly 3 colors are to be used, but the problem says \"exactly 3 colors specified\", which probably means that all three colors must be used in the coloring. Wait, the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\", which may mean that the coloring uses all three colors, but individual nodes can have any of the three. But node 7 has no edges, so we can color it with any of the three. However, in the answer, all three colors must be used somewhere. So perhaps the answer must have at least one node of each color. But let's proceed, keeping that in mind.\n\nContinuing the adjacency list:\n\nNode 0: 41,4,46\nNode 1: 20,10,22 (edges 1-20, 1-10, 1-22)\nNode 2: 33,32,18 (edges 2-33, 2-32, 2-18)\nNode 3: 40,5 (3-40, 3-5)\nNode 4: 45,26,0 (4-45,4-26,0-4)\nNode 5: 15,3 (5-15, 3-5)\nNode 6: 35,43,9 (6-35,6-43,6-9)\nNode 7: (no edges)\nNode 8: 21 (8-21)\nNode 9: 13,28,6 (9-13,9-28,6-9)\nNode 10: 1 (1-10)\nNode 11: (no edges)\nNode 12: (no edges)\nNode 13: 30,39,47,9 (13-30,13-39,13-47,9-13)\nNode 14: 37,44 (14-37,14-44)\nNode 15: 5 (5-15)\nNode 16: (no edges)\nNode 17: 39,45,41 (17-39,17-45,17-41)\nNode 18: 34,24,2 (18-34,18-24,2-18)\nNode 19: 46,39 (19-46,19-39)\nNode 20: 1 (1-20)\nNode 21:8 (8-21)\nNode 22:33,1 (22-33,1-22)\nNode 23:40,32,41 (23-40,23-32,23-41)\nNode 24:18 (18-24)\nNode 25: (no edges)\nNode 26:32,4 (26-32,4-26)\nNode 27:47,45 (27-47,27-45)\nNode 28:33,41,9 (28-33,28-41,9-28)\nNode 29:38 (29-38)\nNode 30:13 (13-30)\nNode 31: (no edges)\nNode 32:26,2,41,23 (26-32,2-32,32-41,23-32)\nNode 33:2,28,22 (2-33,28-33,22-33)\nNode 34:18 (18-34)\nNode 35:6 (6-35)\nNode 36:37,45 (36-37,36-45)\nNode 37:14,36 (14-37,36-37)\nNode 38:29 (29-38)\nNode 39:13,17,19,42 (13-39,17-39,19-39,39-42)\nNode 40:47,3,23 (40-47,3-40,23-40)\nNode 41:0,17,28,32,23 (0-41,17-41,28-41,32-41,23-41)\nNode 42:39 (39-42)\nNode 43:6 (6-43)\nNode 44:14 (14-44)\nNode 45:4,17,36,27 (4-45,17-45,36-45,27-45)\nNode 46:19,0 (19-46,0-46)\nNode 47:27,40,13 (27-47,40-47,13-47)\n\nNow, nodes 7, 11,12,16,25,31 are isolated. So they can be colored with any color, but we need to use all three colors. So perhaps assign color 0,1,2 to some of them to meet the requirement.\n\nLet me proceed with assigning colors.\n\nStart with node 0. Assign color 0. Then its neighbors 41,4,46 can't be 0.\n\nNext, node 1. Its neighbors are 20,10,22. Let's assign color 0. But check if possible. Since node 1's neighbors are all not yet colored. So color 0 is okay. Then 20,10,22 can't be 0.\n\nNode 2: connected to 33,32,18. Assign color 0. But check if possible. No conflicts yet. So color 0. Neighbors 33,32,18 can't be 0.\n\nNode3: connected to 40,5. Assign color 0. Neighbors 40,5 can't be 0.\n\nNode4: connected to 45,26,0 (which is color 0). So color can't be 0. Assign color 1. Now, node4 is 1. Its neighbors 45,26,0 (0 is 0, okay). Now, 45 and 26 can't be 1.\n\nNode5: connected to 15,3 (3 is color 0). Assign color 1. So node5 is 1. Then 15 and 3 can't be 1 (but 3 is 0, so okay).\n\nNode6: connected to 35,43,9. Assign color 0. So 35,43,9 can't be 0.\n\nNode7: isolated. Assign color 0. (But maybe later assign different colors to isolated nodes to cover all three colors.)\n\nNode8: connected to 21. Assign color 0. So 21 can't be 0.\n\nNode9: connected to 13,28,6 (6 is color 0). So node9 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Then neighbors 13,28,6 (6 is 0, so okay). 13 and 28 can't be 1.\n\nNode10: connected to 1 (color 0). Assign color 1.\n\nNode11: isolated. Assign color 1.\n\nNode12: isolated. Assign color 2. (To use all three colors.)\n\nNode13: connected to 30,39,47,9 (9 is color 1). So node13 can't be 1. Assign color 0. Then neighbors 30,39,47 can't be 0. Also, 9 is 1, okay.\n\nNode14: connected to 37,44. Assign color 0. So 37 and 44 can't be 0.\n\nNode15: connected to5 (color1). Assign color0.\n\nNode16: isolated. Assign color0.\n\nNode17: connected to39,45,41. Assign color0. But check neighbors. 39 is connected to 13 (color0) and 17's other neighbors. Wait, node17's neighbors are 39,45,41. Let's see: node39's current color is not assigned yet. Similarly, 45 and 41.\n\nSo node17 can be color0. Then 39,45,41 can't be 0.\n\nNode18: connected to34,24,2 (2 is color0). So node18 can't be 0. Assign color1. Then 34,24 can't be1.\n\nNode19: connected to46,39 (46 is connected to0, which is color0). Node46's color is not assigned yet. So node19 can be color0. Wait, node19 is connected to 46 (0's neighbor, which is connected to 0. 46's color can't be 0, but node19's color can be different. Let's see.\n\nWait, node0 is color0, and is connected to node46, so node46 can't be 0. So node19 is connected to46. If node46 is not colored yet, then when coloring node19, we need to ensure that node19 and node46 are different. But node46 is connected to node0 (color0), so node46 can be 1 or 2. Let's proceed.\n\nNode19: Assign color0. Then node46 must be different from 0 and node19. But node19 is connected to46, so if node19 is color0, then 46 must be 1 or 2. But node46 is also connected to node0 (color0), so it's already required to be non-0. So node19 can be 0, node46 can be 1 or 2. Let's proceed.\n\nBut maybe node19's color should be chosen considering other connections. Node19 is connected to 39 and 46. Let's assign node19 color1. Wait, maybe better to proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a conflict here. Let's think again. Let's process nodes in a way that when a node is colored, its neighbors are processed next.\n\nBut this could take a lot of time. Let me try to proceed systematically.\n\nNode0: color0.\n\nNode1: color0.\n\nNode2: color0.\n\nNode3: color0.\n\nNode4: color1.\n\nNode5: color1.\n\nNode6: color0.\n\nNode7: color0.\n\nNode8: color0.\n\nNode9: color1.\n\nNode10: color1.\n\nNode11: color1.\n\nNode12: color2.\n\nNode13: color0.\n\nNode14: color0.\n\nNode15: color0.\n\nNode16: color0.\n\nNode17: color0.\n\nNode18: color1.\n\nNode19: Let's assign color0. But it's connected to46, which is connected to0 (color0). So 46 must be 1 or 2. If node19 is 0, then node46 must be different. So node19 can't be the same as node46.\n\nBut node46 is connected to0 (color0), so node46 can be 1 or 2. So let's assign node19 color0. Then node46 must be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1 for node46. Then node19 (0) and node46 (1) are different.\n\nSo node19:0.\n\nnode46:1.\n\nNode20: connected to1 (color0). Assign color1.\n\nNode21: connected to8 (color0). Assign color1.\n\nNode22: connected to33 and 1 (color0). Assign color1.\n\nNode23: connected to40,32,41. Let's assign color0. Then 40,32,41 can't be0.\n\nNode24: connected to18 (color1). Assign color0.\n\nNode25: color0.\n\nNode26: connected to4 (color1) and 32. Assign color0. Because 4 is 1. So node26 can be 0, which is allowed. Then 32 can't be 0.\n\nNode27: connected to47 and45. Let's assign color0. Then 47 and45 can't be0.\n\nNode28: connected to33,41,9 (9 is color1). Assign color0. Then 33,41 can't be0. But 9 is color1, which is okay.\n\nNode29: connected to38. Assign color0.\n\nNode30: connected to13 (color0). Assign color1.\n\nNode31: color0.\n\nNode32: connected to26 (color0), 2 (color0),41,23 (color0). So node32 can't be0. Assign color1. Then neighbors 41 and others must not be1.\n\nWait, node32's neighbors are 26 (0), 2 (0), 41 (which could be color?), and 23 (0). So node32 can be color1. Assign color1. Then 41 (connected to 32) can't be1.\n\nNode33: connected to2 (0),28 (0),22 (1). Assign color2. Since 2 and 28 are 0, and 22 is 1. So color2 is possible. Assign node33 to 2.\n\nNow, node33's neighbors: 2 (0),28 (0),22 (1), and others. Wait, but node33's color is 2. So node33's neighbors (like 2,28,22) are okay as they have different colors.\n\nNode34: connected to18 (color1). Assign color0.\n\nNode35: connected to6 (color0). Assign color1.\n\nNode36: connected to37 and45. Assign color0. Then 37 and45 can't be0.\n\nNode37: connected to14 (0) and36 (0). Assign color1. So 14 and36 are 0, so 1 is allowed.\n\nNode38: connected to29 (0). Assign color1.\n\nNode39: connected to13 (0),17 (0),19 (0),42. So node39's neighbors are 0,0,0, and42. So node39 can't be0. Assign color1. Then 42 can't be1.\n\nNode40: connected to47,3 (0),23 (0). Assign color1. Then 47 can't be1. 3 and23 are0, so okay.\n\nNode41: connected to0 (0),17 (0),28 (0),32 (1),23 (0). So node41's neighbors are all 0 except 32 (1). So node41 can be color2. Because 0's color is 0, 17 is 0, 28 is0,32 is1. So 2 is available.\n\nNode42: connected to39 (1). Assign color0.\n\nNode43: connected to6 (0). Assign color1.\n\nNode44: connected to14 (0). Assign color1.\n\nNode45: connected to4 (1),17 (0),36 (0),27 (0). So node45's neighbors are 1,0,0,0. So node45 can be 2. Assign color2.\n\nNode46: connected to0 (0) and19 (0). Wait, node46 is connected to0 (0) and19 (0). Wait, earlier I thought node19 was assigned 0. But node46 must be different from 0. Also, node19 is connected to node46. So if node19 is color0, then node46 must be different. But node46 is connected to0 (color0), so node46 can be 1 or 2. Let's check again.\n\nEarlier, I assigned node46 to 1. So node46's color is 1.\n\nNode47: connected to27 (0),40 (1),13 (0). So node47's neighbors are 0,1,0. So node47 can be color2.\n\nNow, let's check all assignments step by step to see if there are conflicts.\n\nCheck node0 (0): neighbors 41 (2),4 (1),46 (1). All different. Okay.\n\nNode1 (0): neighbors 20 (1),10 (1),22 (1). Wait, node1 is color0. Node20 is connected to1 (0) so color1. Node10 is connected to1 (0) so color1. Node22 is connected to1 (0) so color1. So node1's neighbors are 20,10,22 which are all color1. That's okay. Node1 is 0; different from neighbors.\n\nNode2 (0): neighbors 33 (2),32 (1),18 (1). All different. Good.\n\nNode3 (0): neighbors 40 (1),5 (1). Both 1, so node3 is 0. Okay.\n\nNode4 (1): neighbors 45 (2),26 (0),0 (0). 45 is 2, 26 is0. All good.\n\nNode5 (1): neighbors 15 (0),3 (0). 15 is0,3 is0. So node5 is1. Correct.\n\nNode6 (0): neighbors 35 (1),43 (1),9 (1). All different. Okay.\n\nNode7 (0): isolated. No conflict.\n\nNode8 (0): neighbor 21 (1). Different. Good.\n\nNode9 (1): neighbors13 (0),28 (0),6 (0). All 0. Node9 is1. Correct.\n\nNode10 (1): neighbor1 (0).

Correct.\n\nNode39 (1): neighbors13 (0),17 (0),19 (0),42 (0). Wait, node42 is color0. So node39 is1, node42 is0. Correct.\n\nWait, node39: connected to42. Node42 was assigned color0. So 39 is1, 42 is0. Correct.\n\nNode40 (1): neighbors47 (2),3 (0),23 (0). Correct.\n\nNode41 (2): neighbors0 (0),17 (0),28 (0),32 (1),23 (0). All different. Correct.\n\nNode42 (0): neighbor39 (1). Correct.\n\nNode43 (1): neighbor6 (0). Correct.\n\nNode44 (1): neighbor14 (0). Correct.\n\nNode45 (2): neighbors4 (1),17 (0),36 (0),27 (0). All different. Correct.\n\nNode46 (1): neighbors0 (0),19 (0). Correct.\n\nNode47 (2): neighbors27 (0),40 (1),13 (0). All different. Correct.\n\nNow, check isolated nodes:\n\nNodes 7,11,12,16,25,31,12. Wait, node7 is 0, node11 is1, node12 is2, node16 is0, node25 is0, node31 is0. So colors used are 0,1,2. All three colors are present.\n\nThus, this coloring seems valid.

The nodes are from 0 to 49, which is a lot, and there are a bunch of edges provided. I need to assign each node a color (0, 1, or 2) such that no two connected nodes have the same color. \n\nFirst, I should probably look at the edges to understand the structure. Let me start by listing all the edges again to see if there are any patterns or clusters. Maybe grouping nodes that are connected together. Alternatively, I can approach this by checking each node's connections and assigning colors in a way that avoids conflicts.\n\nSince the problem requires exactly 3 colors, I need to make sure that the graph is 3-colorable. I'm assuming that the graph doesn't have any odd-length cycles, which would make it non-3-colorable. But since the user is asking for a solution, it's probably possible.\n\nMaybe a good approach is to use a greedy algorithm. Start with node 0, assign color 0. Then go to each neighbor and assign a different color, and so on. But since the graph might have cycles, I need to backtrack if a conflict arises. However, with 50 nodes, backtracking manually isn't feasible. Let's see if there's a systematic way.\n\nAlternatively, look for nodes with the highest degree first. Assign colors to nodes with the most connections first to minimize conflicts. Let me check the degree of each node based on the edges provided.\n\nLooking at the edges list:\n\nI can create a list of each node's neighbors. For example:\n\nNode 10 is connected to 37, 44, 4.\nNode 37 is connected to 10, 25, 38, 2.\nWait, let me build this properly. Let's parse all edges and note each node's neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, since time is a constraint, perhaps I can process the edges and note down all connections.\n\nLet me list out all the edges:\n\nEdges:\n10-37,\n19-46,\n15-27,\n15-36,\n5-7,\n29-44,\n16-44,\n7-47,\n1-9,\n34-46,\n2-23,\n28-42,\n17-45,\n30-48,\n26-29,\n33-47,\n25-37,\n18-31,\n20-22,\n16-40,\n23-24,\n25-49,\n18-43,\n5-15,\n14-24,\n4-23,\n21-39,\n37-38,\n5-33,\n27-33,\n14-39,\n9-31,\n8-29,\n11-22,\n1-32,\n6-16,\n9-43,\n27-48,\n10-44,\n19-47,\n2-37,\n33-46,\n4-10,\n38-42,\n1-47,\n6-46,\n39-43,\n23-44,\n22-36,\n0-15,\n9-30,\n11-27.\n\nNow, let's note down each node's neighbors:\n\nStarting with node 0: connected to 15.\n\nNode 1: connected to 9, 32, 47.\n\nNode 2: connected to 23, 37.\n\nNode 3: Hmm, looking through the edges, I don't see node 3 mentioned. So node 3 has no edges? Then its color can be 0.\n\nWait, but let's check again. The edges provided don't include node 3 in any of them. So yes, node 3 is isolated. So its color can be 0.\n\nProceeding:\n\nNode 4: connected to 23, 10.\n\nNode5: connected to 7,15,33.\n\nNode6: connected to16,46.\n\nNode7: connected to5,47.\n\nNode8: connected to29.\n\nNode9: connected to1,31,43,30.\n\nNode10: connected to37,44,4.\n\nNode11: connected to22,27.\n\nNode12: Not in any edge. So isolated. Color 0.\n\nSimilarly, node 13: not in edges. So color 0.\n\nWait, need to check all nodes from 0-49. Let's see which nodes are not present in the edges list.\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\nThe nodes listed in edges (from the given list) are:\n\n0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,36,37,38,39,40,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49.\n\nSo nodes not present in edges: 3,12,13,35,41, etc. So nodes 3, 12,13, 35,41 are isolated. Wait, let's confirm.\n\nThe list of edges given doesn't include nodes like 3,12,13,35,41. So these nodes have no edges. So their color can be 0, as they don't conflict with anyone.\n\nSo for all these isolated nodes (3,12,13,35,41), assign color 0.\n\nNow, for the other nodes:\n\nLet's process them one by one.\n\nLet me start with node 0: connected to 15. Assign color 0. Then node 15 must be a different color, say 1.\n\nNode15 is connected to 0, 27,36,5. So color 1. Then 27,36,5 must not be 1.\n\nProceeding:\n\nNode5: connected to7,15,33. Since 15 is color 1, node5 can't be 1. Let's assign color 0. But then check if 7 and 33 are connected to 5. So node5 is 0. Then 7 and 33 can't be 0.\n\nNode7: connected to5 (color0) and 47. So 7 can be color1 or 2. Let's choose 1.\n\nThen node47 is connected to7 (color1), 33,19,1. So node47 can't be 1.\n\nNode33 is connected to5 (color0), 27,47,46. So node33 can't be 0. Assign color1. Then 47 can't be 1. So node47 could be color2.\n\nThen node47's neighbors: 7 (1), 33 (1), 19, 1. So node47 is color2. So node47's color is 2.\n\nNow node1 is connected to9,32,47 (color2). So node1 can't be 2. Assign 0. But node1's neighbors: 9,32,47. Let's check if 9's color is set yet.\n\nNode9 is connected to1 (0),31,43,30. So node9's color can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nThen node31 is connected to9 (1) and 18. Assign color0.\n\nNode18 is connected to31 (0), 43. So node18 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode43 is connected to18 (1),9 (1),39. So node43 can't be 1. Assign 0. But node39 is connected to43 (0) and 14,21.\n\nNode39: connected to21,14,43 (0). So 39 can't be 0. Assign 1 or 2. Let's proceed.\n\nBut let's backtrack a bit. Let's process node by node, maybe using a method where each node is assigned the first available color that doesn't conflict with already colored neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a BFS approach, processing nodes in some order, and assigning colors as we go.\n\nBut with the time constraints, I need a systematic way. Let's list all nodes and their neighbors, then try to assign colors step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph might have certain structures. Let's see if there's a way to split into 3 colors.\n\nLet me start by creating a list of all nodes and their neighbors.\n\nFirst, create an adjacency list:\n\nAdjacency list:\n\n0: [15]\n\n1: [9,32,47]\n\n2: [23,37]\n\n3: []\n\n4: [23,10]\n\n5: [7,15,33]\n\n6: [16,46]\n\n7: [5,47]\n\n8: [29]\n\n9: [1,31,43,30]\n\n10: [37,44,4]\n\n11: [22,27]\n\n12: []\n\n13: []\n\n14: [24,39]\n\n15: [0,27,36,5]\n\n16: [44,40,6]\n\n17: [45]\n\n18: [31,43]\n\n19: [46,47]\n\n20: [22]\n\n21: [39]\n\n22: [20,36,11]\n\n23: [2,24,44,4]\n\n24: [23,14]\n\n25: [37,49]\n\n26: [29]\n\n27: [15,33,48,11]\n\n28: [42]\n\n29: [44,8,26,10]\n\n30: [48,9]\n\n31: [9,18]\n\n32: [1]\n\n33: [5,27,47,46]\n\n34: [46]\n\n35: []\n\n36: [15,22]\n\n37: [10,25,38,2]\n\n38: [37,42]\n\n39: [21,14,43]\n\n40: [16]\n\n41: []\n\n42: [28,38]\n\n43: [9,18,39]\n\n44: [29,16,10,23,19]\n\n45: [17]\n\n46: [19,34,6,33]\n\n47: [7,33,19,1]\n\n48: [27,30]\n\n49: [25]\n\nNow, let's assign colors. Let's start with nodes that have higher degrees, as they are more constrained. Let's look for nodes with the highest degree.\n\nLooking at the adjacency list:\n\nNode44 has degree 5: connected to 29,16,10,23,19.\n\nNode10: degree 3 (37,44,4)\n\nNode15: degree 4 (0,27,36,5)\n\nNode23: connected to 2,24,44,4 (degree 4)\n\nNode27: connected to 15,33,48,11 (degree 4)\n\nNode5: connected to7,15,33 (degree3)\n\nNode33: connected to5,27,47,46 (degree4)\n\nNode47: connected to7,33,19,1 (degree4)\n\nNode9: connected to1,31,43,30 (degree4)\n\nNode37: connected to10,25,38,2 (degree4)\n\nNode29: connected to44,8,26,10 (degree4)\n\nHmm. Node44 has the highest degree (5). Let's start with node44. Assign color0.\n\nNow, all neighbors of node44 must not be color0. Neighbors are 29,16,10,23,19.\n\nProceeding:\n\nnode44: color0.\n\nThen node29 must be color1 or 2.\n\nBut node29 is connected to 44 (0), 8,26,10.\n\nAssign node29: color1.\n\nBut node29's neighbors: 8,26,10. These need to not be 1.\n\nNode8 is connected to 29 (1). So node8 can be 0 or 2.\n\nLet's assign node8:0.\n\nNode26 is connected to29 (1). Assign node26:0.\n\nNode10 is connected to44 (0) and 37,4. Assign color1.\n\nSo node10: color1.\n\nNow, node10's neighbors:37,4,44 (0). So 37 and 4 can't be 1.\n\nNode37: connected to10 (1),25,38,2. Assign color0 or 2.\n\nLet's pick 0.\n\nBut node37's color0. Then node25 is connected to37 (0), so node25 can't be 0. Assign color1.\n\nNode25: color1. Then node49 (connected to25) must not be 1. Assign color0.\n\nNode25's neighbors:37 (0),49. So 49 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nNow node49: color0.\n\nBack to node37's neighbors:10 (1),25 (1),38,2.\n\nSo node37 is color0. Then node38 and 2 can't be 0.\n\nNode38 is connected to37 (0) and 42. Assign color1.\n\nNode42: connected to38 (1) and 28. So node42 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nNode28 is connected to42 (0). So node28 can be 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nNow node28:1.\n\nBack to node38: color1. Then node42 is 0.\n\nNode38:1.\n\nNow, node2 is connected to37 (0) and 23. So node2 can't be 0. Assign color1 or 2.\n\nBut node23 is connected to44 (0), so node23 can't be 0. Let's process node23.\n\nNode23 is connected to2,24,44 (0),4. Assign color1 or 2.\n\nBut node44 is 0, so node23 can be 1 or 2. Let's assign 1.\n\nnode23: color1.\n\nThen node2 is connected to23 (1), so node2 can't be 1. Assign color0 or 2. But node2's neighbor37 is color0, so node2 can't be 0. So node2 must be 2.\n\nnode2: color2.\n\nNode4 is connected to23 (1), 10 (1). So node4 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Let's choose 0.\n\nnode4:0.\n\nProceeding.\n\nnode24 is connected to23 (1),14. So node24 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nnode24:0.\n\nThen node14 is connected to24 (0) and 39. Assign color1.\n\nnode14:1.\n\nnode39 is connected to14 (1),21,43. So node39 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nnode39:0.\n\nnode21 is connected to39 (0). Assign color1.\n\nnode21:1.\n\nnode43 is connected to39 (0),9,18. So node43 can't be 0. Assign 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nnode43:1.\n\nNow back to node9, which is connected to1,31,43 (1),30. So node9 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2.\n\nBut node1's color is to be determined. Let's check node1.\n\nnode1 is connected to9,32,47. Let's see if we have assigned colors to any of these.\n\nnode9: not yet assigned. So let's proceed.\n\nWait, node9's color hasn't been assigned yet. So perhaps we need to process node9. But node9's neighbors:1,31,43,30.\n\nnode43 is color1. So node9 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2.\n\nnode1 is connected to9, 32,47. If node9 is assigned 0, then node1 can't be 0. Let's assign node9:2.\n\nWait, node9's neighbors are 1 (color?), 31 (color?),43 (1),30 (color?).\n\nSince node43 is 1, node9 can't be 1. Let's choose color0 for node9.\n\nBut node1 is connected to9. If node9 is 0, node1 can't be 0. Let's see.\n\nLet's proceed:\n\nAssign node9:0. Then node1's neighbors are 9 (0),32,47. So node1 can be 1 or 2.\n\nBut let's check node1's other connections. node47 is connected to1, which is yet to be colored.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nnode9:0. Then node31 is connected to9 (0) and 18. Assign node31:1.\n\nnode31:1.\n\nnode18 is connected to31 (1),43 (1). So node18 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nnode18:0.\n\nBut node43 is connected to18 (0) and 9 (0) and 39 (0). So node43 can't be 0. Earlier we assigned node43 as 1, which is correct.\n\nNow node30 is connected to9 (0) and 48. Assign color1.\n\nnode30:1.\n\nnode48 is connected to27 and 30 (1). So node48 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nnode48:0.\n\nBack to node27: connected to15 (color1),33,48 (0),11. Assign color2.\n\nnode27:2.\n\nnode15: color1. So node27 is 2. That's okay.\n\nnode33 is connected to5,27 (2),47,46. Assign color0 or 1.\n\nnode5 is connected to7,15 (1),33. node5's color is to be determined.\n\nWait, node5: earlier I thought node5 is color0. Let's check.\n\nnode5's neighbors:7 (color1),15 (1),33. So node5 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nnode5:0.\n\nThen node33's neighbors:5 (0),27 (2),47 (color?),46 (color?). So node33 can be 1 or something else. Let's assign node33:1.\n\nnode33:1.\n\nThen node47 is connected to33 (1),19,7 (color1),1 (color?). So node47 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Let's assign 2.\n\nnode47:2.\n\nNow node1's neighbors:9 (0),32 (color?),47 (2). So node1 can be 1.\n\nnode1:1.\n\nnode32 is connected to1 (1). Assign 0.\n\nnode32:0.\n\nBack to node47:2.\n\nnode19 is connected to46 and 47 (2). Assign color0 or 1.\n\nnode46 is connected to19,34,6,33 (1). Assign color0 or 2.\n\nnode6 is connected to16,46. Assign color0 or 1.\n\nBut let's process node46 first. node46: neighbors 19,34,6,33 (1). So can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2.\n\nnode46:0.\n\nThen node19: connected to46 (0),47 (2). So node19 can be 1.\n\nnode19:1.\n\nnode34: connected to46 (0). Assign 1.\n\nnode34:1.\n\nnode6: connected to16,46 (0). Assign 1.\n\nnode6:1.\n\nnode16 is connected to44 (0),40,6 (1). Assign 2.\n\nnode16:2.\n\nnode40: connected to16 (2). Assign 0.\n\nnode40:0.\n\nNow, node7: connected to5 (0),47 (2). Assign 1.\n\nnode7:1.\n\nNow node7 is color1, which conflicts with node5 (0) okay.\n\nNow, node17: connected to45. Assign 0.\n\nnode17:0.\n\nnode45: connected to17 (0). Assign 1.\n\nnode45:1.\n\nnode20: connected to22. Assign 0.\n\nnode20:0.\n\nnode22: connected to20 (0),36,11. Assign 1 or 2.\n\nnode11: connected to22,27 (2). Assign color0 or 1.\n\nBut node22's color: Assign 1. Then node11 can't be 1. Assign 0.\n\nnode22:1.\n\nnode11:0.\n\nnode36: connected to15 (1),22 (1). Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nnode36:0.\n\nNow node22:1.\n\nnode36:0.\n\nnode22:1. Check neighbors: 20 (0),36 (0),11 (0) – no conflict.\n\nnode11:0.\n\nnode27:2.\n\nnode27's neighbors:15 (1),33 (1),48 (0),11 (0). No conflict.\n\nnode25:1. Connected to37 (0),49 (0). No conflict.\n\nnode37:0. Connected to10 (1),25 (1),38 (1),2 (2). No conflict.\n\nnode38:1. Connected to37 (0),42 (0). No conflict.\n\nnode42:0. Connected to28 (1),38 (1). No conflict.\n\nnode28:1. Connected to42 (0). No conflict.\n\nnode26:0. Connected to29 (1). No conflict.\n\nnode29:1. Connected to44 (0),8 (0),26 (0),10 (1). So 10 is color1, but node29 is color1. Wait, that's a conflict! Oh no, node29 is color1 and node10 is color1, and they are connected (edge 10-29). That's a problem. So I must have made a mistake here.\n\nLet's backtrack to where node29 was assigned.\n\nEarlier steps:\n\nnode44 was assigned color0. Its neighbors:29,16,10,23,19.\n\nSo node29,16,10,23,19 cannot be 0.\n\nWe assigned node29 to color1. Then node29's neighbors are 44 (0),8,26,10.\n\nSo node8,26,10 cannot be 1. Wait, no: node29's color is 1. Its neighbors 8,26,10 cannot be 1. So when we assigned node10 to color1, that's a conflict because node10 is connected to node29 (color1). So that's invalid.\n\nThis is a mistake. Let's see where we went wrong.\n\nSo when we assigned node44:0, node29 can't be 0. So we set node29:1. Then node10 is connected to node29 (1), so node10 can't be 1. But in our previous steps, we set node10 to color1, which conflicts with node29. That's an error.\n\nThis suggests that the initial approach has a flaw and we need to adjust the colors.\n\nLet's retrace:\n\nAfter assigning node44:0.\n\nnode29 can't be 0, so color1 or 2.\n\nWe set node29:1. Then node10 is connected to node29 (1), so node10 can't be 1. So node10's color must be 0 or 2. But node10 is connected to node44 (0), so can't be 0. Therefore, node10 must be 2.\n\nSo let's correct that.\n\nnode10:2.\n\nThen node10's neighbors:37,44 (0),4. So 37 and 4 can't be 2.\n\nnode37: connected to10 (2),25,38,2. Assign color0 or 1.\n\nAssign node37:0.\n\nThen node25 connected to37 (0) can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nnode25:1.\n\nnode49 connected to25 (1) can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nnode49:0.\n\nNow, node37 is 0. So node38 connected to37 (0) can't be 0. Assign 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nnode38:1.\n\nnode42 connected to38 (1) can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nnode42:0.\n\nnode28 connected to42 (0) can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nnode28:1.\n\nnode38:1.\n\nNow, node2 connected to37 (0) can't be 0. Assign 1 or 2. But node2 is also connected to23. Let's assign node2:2.\n\nnode2:2.\n\nnode23 connected to44 (0),4 (assigned earlier?),2 (2). So node23 can't be 0 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nnode23:1.\n\nnode4 connected to23 (1),10 (2). So node4 can't be 1 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nnode4:0.\n\nnode24 connected to23 (1),14. So node24 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nnode24:0.\n\nnode14 connected to24 (0),39. Assign 1.\n\nnode14:1.\n\nnode39 connected to14 (1),21,43. Can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nnode39:0.\n\nnode21 connected to39 (0) can be 1.\n\nnode21:1.\n\nnode43 connected to39 (0),9,18. Assign 1.\n\nnode43:1.\n\nnode9 connected to1,31,43 (1),30. Can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nnode9:0.\n\nnode31 connected to9 (0),18. Assign 1.\n\nnode31:1.\n\nnode18 connected to31 (1),43 (1). Can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nnode18:0.\n\nnode30 connected to9 (0),48. Assign 1.\n\nnode30:1.\n\nnode48 connected to27,30 (1). Can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nnode48:0.\n\nnode27 connected to15,33,48 (0),11. Assign color2.\n\nnode27:2.\n\nnode15 connected to0,27 (2),36,5. Assign color1.\n\nnode15:1.\n\nnode5 connected to7,15 (1),33. Can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nnode5:0.\n\nnode7 connected to5 (0),47. Assign 1.\n\nnode7:1.\n\nnode47 connected to7 (1),33,19,1. Assign 0 or 2.\n\nnode33 connected to5 (0),27 (2),47,46. Assign color1.\n\nnode33:1.\n\nnode47 can't be 1. Assign 2.\n\nnode47:2.\n\nnode1 connected to9 (0),32,47 (2). Assign 1.\n\nnode1:1.\n\nnode32 connected to1 (1) assign 0.\n\nnode32:0.\n\nnode6 connected to16,46. Assign color0 or 1.\n\nnode46 connected to19,34,6,33 (1). Assign color0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nnode46:0.\n\nnode6: connected to16,46 (0). Assign 1.\n\nnode6:1.\n\nnode16 connected to44 (0),40,6 (1). Assign 2.\n\nnode16:2.\n\nnode40 connected to16 (2). Assign 0.\n\nnode40:0.\n\nnode19 connected to46 (0),47 (2). Assign 1.\n\nnode19:1.\n\nnode34 connected to46 (0). Assign 1.\n\nnode34:1.\n\nnode17 connected to45. Assign 0.\n\nnode17:0.\n\nnode45 connected to17 (0). Assign 1.\n\nnode45:1.\n\nnode20 connected to22. Assign 0.\n\nnode20:0.\n\nnode22 connected to20 (0),36,11. Assign 1 or 2.\n\nnode36 connected to15 (1),22. Assign color0.\n\nnode36:0.\n\nnode22 connected to20 (0),36 (0),11. Assign 1.\n\nnode22:1.\n\nnode11 connected to22 (1),27 (2). Assign 0.\n\nnode11:0.\n\nNow, check for any conflicts:\n\nFor example, node10 is color2, connected to node29 (color1) – okay.\n\nnode29 is color1, connected to node10 (2) – okay.\n\nnode29 also connected to node8. Let's check node8. node8: connected to29 (1). Assign color0 or 2.

I need to assign colors to 23 nodes (0 through 22) using exactly 3 colors (0, 1, 2). The key is that adjacent nodes must not share the same color. Let me start by understanding the structure of the graph through the given edges.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges to see the connections:\n\n- 12 - 16\n- 3 - 13\n- 0 - 5\n- 8 - 21\n- 2 - 11\n- 10 - 18\n- 2 - 14\n- 0 - 20\n- 6 - 20\n- 12 - 18\n- 9 - 10\n- 11 - 13\n- 11 - 22\n- 6 - 7\n- 15 - 19\n- 12 - 20\n- 0 - 3\n- 0 - 12\n- 9 - 21\n- 8 - 13\n- 9 - 18\n- 8 - 22\n- 0 - 18\n- 1 - 22\n\nHmm, node 0 seems connected to multiple nodes: 5, 20, 3, 12, 18. So, node 0's color must differ from all these. Let me note that down.\n\nLooking at node 0's neighbors: 5, 20, 3, 12, 18. So whatever color I assign to 0, these nodes can't be the same. Let's pick color 1 for node 0. Then all these neighbors must be 0 or 2.\n\nLet's see node 12. It's connected to 16, 18, 20, and 0. Since 0 is color 1, 12 can be 0 or 2. Let's choose color 0 for node 12. Then nodes 16, 18, 20 (connected to 12) can't be 0. Node 16 must be a different color from 12 (0), so it can be 1 or 2. Similarly, node 18 connected to 12 (0) and to 10, 9, 0 (color 1). So 18 can't be 0 or 1 (since 0 is connected to 18 and 0 has color 1). Wait, no: 0 is connected to 18, so 18 can't be color 1. 12 is connected to 18, so 18 can't be 0. Therefore, 18 must be color 2.\n\nSo 18 is color 2. Then, looking at node 10 connected to 18 (color 2) and 9. So 10 can't be 2. Let's assign 10 a color different from 18 and 9. Wait, 9 is connected to 10 as per edge 9-10. So 9 and 10 must have different colors. Also, 9 is connected to 21 and 18. Let's check: 9 is connected to 10 (so they differ), to 21 (edge 9-21 and 8-21), and to 18 (color 2). So 9 can't be 2 (due to 18), and can't be same as 10. Let's see. If 10 is color 0, then 9 can be 1. Then 21 connected to 9 (color 1) and to 8. Let's see. 8 is connected to 21, 13, 22. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nMaybe start building the color assignments step by step.\n\nAssigning node 0: color 1.\n\nAdjacent nodes (5, 20, 3, 12, 18) must not be 1.\n\nLet's pick node 12 next. Since it's connected to 0 (color 1), so possible colors 0 or 2. Assign color 0 to node 12. Then nodes connected to 12 (16, 18, 20) can't be 0.\n\nNode 16: connected to 12 (0). So can be 1 or 2. Let's assign color 1 to node 16.\n\nNode 18: connected to 12 (0) and 0 (1). So 18 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2 to node 18. Then, nodes connected to 18 (10, 9, 12, 0) must adjust. So node 10 is connected to 18 (color 2), so 10 can't be 2. Also, node 10 is connected to 9 (edge 9-10). So 9 and 10 must have different colors.\n\nLet's handle node 10. Since 18 is 2, 10 can be 0 or 1. Let's assign 10 to 0. Then node 9, connected to 10 (0) and to 18 (2), so 9 can't be 0 or 2. Assign color 1 to node 9.\n\nNow, node 9 is connected to 21 (edge 9-21). So node 21 can't be 1. Also, node 8 is connected to 21 (edge 8-21). So 8's color must differ from 21's. Let's assign 21. Since 9 is 1, 21 can be 0 or 2. Let's choose color 2 for 21. Then node 8 (connected to 21) can't be 2. So 8's color could be 0 or 1.\n\nBut node 8 is also connected to 13 and 22. Let's see. Node 8 is connected to 21 (2), 13, and 22. Let's see if we can assign 8 to 0. Then 13 and 22 must not be 0.\n\nBut let's check node 13's connections. Node 13 is connected to 3 (since 3-13), 11 (11-13), and 8 (8-13). Let's see. 3 is connected to 0 (color 1) and 13. So 3 can't be 1. Assign color 0 to node 3. Then, node 13, connected to 3 (0), 11, and 8. Let's assign color 1 to node 13. Then, 11 (connected to 13) can't be 1. Also, node 11 is connected to 2, 13, 22. Let's check node 2. It's connected to 11 and 14. Assigning node 2: connected to 11 (needs color different from 2 and 14). Let's pick color 0 for node 2. Then 11 must not be 0 (since 2 is 0) and 13 (1). So 11 can be 2. Assign 11 to 2. Then 22 is connected to 11 (2) and 8 (0). So node 22 must be different from 2 and 0. So color 1. Then 22's color is 1. But node 1 is connected to 22 (edge 1-22), so node 1 can't be 1. Assign color 0 or 2 to node 1.\n\nWait, let's track this step by step:\n\n- Node 3: connected to 0 (1) and 13. Assign color 0.\n- Node 13: connected to 3 (0), 11 (2), and 8. So 13 can't be 0 or 2. Assign 1.\n- Node 8: connected to 21 (2), 13 (1), and 22 (1). So 8 can't be 1 or 2. Assign 0.\n- Node 22: connected to 11 (2) and 8 (0). So 22 can be 1. Then node 1 is connected to 22 (1) so 1 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Let's pick 0 for node 1.\n\nSo node 1's color is 0.\n\nBack to node 8: color is 0. So connected to 21 (2), 13 (1), 22 (1). All good.\n\nNow, node 5 is connected to 0 (1). Assign color 0 to node 5.\n\nNode 20 is connected to 0 (1), 6, and 12 (0). So 20 can't be 1 or 0. Assign 2. But 6 is connected to 20. So node 6's color can't be 2. Also, node 6 is connected to 7 (edge 6-7). Let's handle node 6 and 7.\n\nNode 20 is color 2. So node 6 connected to 20 (2) can be 0 or 1. Let's assign 0 to node 6. Then node 7, connected to 6 (0), can be 1 or 2. Assign 1 to node 7.\n\nNode 14 is connected to 2 (0). Assign color 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nSo far, the assignments:\n\n0:1\n1:0\n2:0\n3:0\n5:0\n6:0\n7:1\n8:0\n9:1\n10:0\n11:2\n12:0\n13:1\n14:1\n16:1\n18:2\n20:2\n21:2\n22:1\n12:0 is correct. Now check remaining nodes: 4, 15,17,19, and others.\n\nWait, nodes list is 0-22. So all 23 nodes. Let's check which nodes we have assigned:\n\nAssigned: 0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,18,20,21,22. Missing: 4,15,17,19.\n\nNodes 4: not connected in the edges listed. So node 4 can be any color. Assign color 0.\n\nNode 15: connected to 19 (edge 15-19). Assign colors to 15 and 19. Let's pick 0 and 1. Assign 15:0, 19:1. Since they are connected, different colors.\n\nNode 17: not mentioned in edges. Assign color 0.\n\nWait, but need to check if node 17 has any edges. Looking back at the edges list:\n\nWait the edges given are:\n\n12-16,3-13,0-5,8-21,2-11,10-18,2-14,0-20,6-20,12-18,9-10,11-13,11-22,6-7,15-19,12-20,0-3,0-12,9-21,8-13,9-18,8-22,0-18,1-22.\n\nSo nodes 4,17 are not connected to anyone. So their colors can be any of the three. Assign them 0 for simplicity.\n\nSo node4:0, node15:0, node17:0, node19:1 (since 15 is 0 and connected to 19, which is 1). Wait, node15 and 19 are connected. So 15 is 0, 19 must be 1 or 2. Let's assign 1 to node19.\n\nNow check all nodes:\n\n0:1\n1:0\n2:0\n3:0\n4:0\n5:0\n6:0\n7:1\n8:0\n9:1\n10:0\n11:2\n12:0\n13:1\n14:1\n15:0\n16:1\n17:0\n18:2\n19:1\n20:2\n21:2\n22:1\n\nNow check all edges to ensure no adjacent nodes have same color.\n\nCheck 12-16:12(0) vs16(1) → ok.\n3-13:3(0) vs13(1) → ok.\n0-5:0(1) vs5(0) → ok.\n8-21:8(0) vs21(2) → ok.\n2-11:2(0) vs11(2) → Wait, problem here. 2 and 11 are both 0 and 2. 2 is color0, 11 is color2. Different, so ok.\n10-18:10(0) vs18(2) → ok.\n2-14:2(0) vs14(1) → ok.\n0-20:0(1) vs20(2) → ok.\n6-20:6(0) vs20(2) → ok.\n12-18:12(0) vs18(2) → ok.\n9-10:9(1) vs10(0) → ok.\n11-13:11(2) vs13(1) → ok.\n11-22:11(2) vs22(1) → ok.\n6-7:6(0) vs7(1) → ok.\n15-19:15(0) vs19(1) → ok.\n12-20:12(0) vs20(2) → ok.\n0-3:0(1) vs3(0) → ok.\n0-12:0(1) vs12(0) → ok.\n9-21:9(1) vs21(2) → ok.\n8-13:8(0) vs13(1) → ok.\n9-18:9(1) vs18(2) → ok.\n8-22:8(0) vs22(1) → ok.\n0-18:0(1) vs18(2) → ok.\n1-22:1(0) vs22(1) → ok.\n\nOther nodes not connected: 4,17. Assign 0.\n\nLooks like all edges are properly colored. Now check if all nodes are assigned and colors are 0,1,2. Let me list all nodes:\n\n0:1\n1:0\n2:0\n3:0\n4:0\n5:0\n6:0\n7:1\n8:0\n9:1\n10:0\n11:2\n12:0\n13:1\n14:1\n15:0\n16:1\n17:0\n18:2\n19:1\n20:2\n21:2\n22:1\n\nYes, all 23 nodes are covered.

Let's see... The nodes are from 0 to 38. First, I should list all the edges to understand the connections. Let me go through the edges one by one to build the adjacency list.\n\nStarting with the edges:\n\n1-28, 10-37, 16-20, 2-33, 7-20, 18-29, 6-33, 4-15, 12-28, 9-14, 0-5, 12-37, 8-33, 19-33, 9-32, 30-33, 11-38, 15-29, 24-38, 6-26, 3-12, 6-29, 21-30, 14-15, 34-36, 37-38, 27-33, 19-29, 11-28, 7-12, 1-26, 13-31, 13-37, 20-21, 4-10, 3-26, 8-13, 17-22, 3-29, 2-9, 10-19, 15-18.\n\nHmm, that's a lot. Maybe creating an adjacency list would help. Let's note down each node's neighbors.\n\nFor example, node 1 is connected to 28 and 26 (from edges 1-28 and 1-26). Let's process all edges:\n\nNode 0: 5\nNode 1: 28, 26\nNode 2: 33,9\nNode 3:12,26,29\nNode4:15,10\nNode5:0\nNode6:33,26,29\nNode7:20,12\nNode8:33,13\nNode9:14,32,2,19 (since 2-9 and 9-32,9-14, and 10-19 is part of 9's connections? Wait, no. Let's check again. The edge 2-9 connects node 2 and 9. Edge 9-14 connects 9 and 14. Edge 9-32 connects 9 and 32. Edge 10-19 is between 10 and 19. So node9's edges are 14,32,2, and maybe others?\n\nWait, wait. Let's recheck all edges. Let me list each edge again properly:\n\nEdges list:\n\n1-28,\n10-37,\n16-20,\n2-33,\n7-20,\n18-29,\n6-33,\n4-15,\n12-28,\n9-14,\n0-5,\n12-37,\n8-33,\n19-33,\n9-32,\n30-33,\n11-38,\n15-29,\n24-38,\n6-26,\n3-12,\n6-29,\n21-30,\n14-15,\n34-36,\n37-38,\n27-33,\n19-29,\n11-28,\n7-12,\n1-26,\n13-31,\n13-37,\n20-21,\n4-10,\n3-26,\n8-13,\n17-22,\n3-29,\n2-9,\n10-19,\n15-18.\n\nSo for node 9: edges are 9-14, 9-32, 2-9 (so connected to 2), and 10-19 (which is node 10 connected to 19, but 9 isn't involved here. So node9's connections are 14, 32, 2. Wait, the edge 2-9: that's node2 connected to node9. So node9 is connected to 2, 14, 32. Also, in the edge 10-19, that's node10 and 19. So node9's edges are 14,32,2. Then, looking at edge 2-9, node9 is connected to 2. So node2 is connected to 33 and 9. Node9 is connected to 2, 14, 32.\n\nWait, maybe I need to list each node's neighbors step by step.\n\nLet me start from node0:\n\nEdges for node0: 0-5. So neighbor is 5.\n\nNode1: edges are 1-28, 1-26. So neighbors 28,26.\n\nNode2: edges 2-33, 2-9. So neighbors 33,9.\n\nNode3: edges 3-12,3-26,3-29. Neighbors 12,26,29.\n\nNode4: edges 4-15,4-10. Neighbors 15,10.\n\nNode5: edge0-5. Neighbor 0.\n\nNode6: edges6-33,6-26,6-29. Neighbors 33,26,29.\n\nNode7: edges7-20,7-12. Neighbors20,12.\n\nNode8: edges8-33,8-13. Neighbors33,13.\n\nNode9: edges9-14,9-32,2-9. So neighbors14,32,2.\n\nWait, 2-9: node9 is connected to node2. So node9's neighbors are 2,14,32.\n\nNode10: edges10-37,4-10,10-19. So neighbors37,4,19.\n\nNode11: edges11-38,11-28. Neighbors38,28.\n\nNode12: edges12-28,12-37,3-12,7-12. So neighbors28,37,3,7.\n\nNode13: edges8-13,13-31,13-37. Neighbors8,31,37.\n\nNode14: edges9-14,14-15. Neighbors9,15.\n\nNode15: edges4-15,15-29,14-15,15-18. Neighbors4,29,14,18.\n\nWait, the edges 4-15,15-29,14-15,15-18. So node15 has neighbors4,29,14,18.\n\nNode16: edge16-20. Neighbor20.\n\nNode17: edge17-22. Neighbor22.\n\nNode18: edges18-29,15-18. Neighbors29,15.\n\nNode19: edges19-33,19-29,10-19. So neighbors33,29,10.\n\nNode20: edges16-20,7-20,20-21. Neighbors16,7,21.\n\nNode21: edges20-21,21-30. Neighbors20,30.\n\nNode22: edge17-22. Neighbor17.\n\nNode23: Wait, no edges listed for node23. But in the nodes list, nodes go up to 38, so node23 exists but isn't connected to anything. So node23 is an isolated node. So its color can be 0, but need to check if there are any other nodes connected to it. Wait, looking back at the edges list, I don't see node23 mentioned. So node23 has no edges. So it can be colored 0, as it has no neighbors.\n\nSimilarly, nodes like 24: edge24-38. So node24's neighbor is38.\n\nNode25: Wait, the nodes are 0 to 38. So nodes 25, 23, etc. Are there edges for node25? Let's check the edges again. Looking through the edges provided, I don't see node25 mentioned. So node25 is also isolated. Similarly, nodes like 34, 35, 36 (edge34-36), node35 is not mentioned. So node35 is isolated. So all these nodes have no edges.\n\nSo, when coloring, these isolated nodes can take any color, but since we're allowed exactly 3 colors, but perhaps using color 0 for them is safe.\n\nBut I need to make sure all connected nodes are colored properly. Let's start by considering all nodes and their connections.\n\nFirst, perhaps the graph has several connected components. For example, node23 is isolated. Similarly, node25 is isolated. But the majority are connected through the edges.\n\nThe problem is to assign colors 0,1,2 such that adjacent nodes have different colors. Since it's a 3-coloring problem, and the graph might be 3-colorable. Let's try to find a valid coloring.\n\nSince the graph isn't necessarily connected, but has multiple components, perhaps even cycles, the strategy would be to assign colors in a way that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.\n\nApproach: Start with the nodes that have higher degrees (more neighbors) as they might be more constrained. But without knowing degrees, perhaps process nodes in order and assign the smallest possible color not used by their neighbors.\n\nLet's create a list of all nodes and their neighbors, then assign colors step by step.\n\nLet me create the adjacency list:\n\nNode 0: [5]\nNode 1: [28,26]\nNode 2: [33,9]\nNode3: [12,26,29]\nNode4: [15,10]\nNode5: [0]\nNode6: [33,26,29]\nNode7: [20,12]\nNode8: [33,13]\nNode9: [14,32,2]\nNode10: [37,4,19]\nNode11: [38,28]\nNode12: [28,37,3,7]\nNode13: [8,31,37]\nNode14: [9,15]\nNode15: [4,29,14,18]\nNode16: [20]\nNode17: [22]\nNode18: [29,15]\nNode19: [33,29,10]\nNode20: [16,7,21]\nNode21: [20,30]\nNode22: [17]\nNode23: [] (isolated)\nNode24: [38]\nNode25: [] (isolated)\nNode26: [1,3,6] (from edges 1-26, 3-26, 6-26)\nWait, edges 1-26: node1 and node26. So node26's neighbors are 1,3,6.\n\nSimilarly, node27: edge27-33. So node27 connected to 33.\n\nWait, node27: edge27-33. So node27's neighbor is 33.\n\nNode28: edges include 1-28, 12-28, 11-28. So node28's neighbors are 1,12,11.\n\nNode29: edges include 18-29, 15-29, 6-29,3-29,19-29,18 (Wait, node18's edge is 18-29. Node15's edge 15-29. Node6's edge6-29. Node3's edge3-29. Node19's edge19-29. So node29 is connected to 18,15,6,3,19.\n\nSo node29: [18,15,6,3,19]\n\nNode30: [33,21] (edge30-33 and 21-30)\n\nWait, edge30-33: node30 and 33. Edge21-30: node21 and 30. So node30's neighbors are 33 and 21.\n\nNode31: [13] (edge13-31. So node31 connected to 13.\n\nNode32: [9] (edge9-32. So node32 connected to9.\n\nNode33: has edges with 2,6,8,19,30,27,12 (Wait, let's recheck. Edge2-33 (node2 connected to33). Edge6-33. Edge8-33. Edge19-33. Edge30-33. Edge27-33. Also, edges like 2-33, 6-33, 8-33, 19-33,30-33,27-33. So node33 is connected to 2,6,8,19,30,27. Also, perhaps others? Let me check all edges:\n\nEdges where node33 appears: \n\n2-33,6-33,8-33,19-33,30-33,27-33.\n\nSo node33's neighbors: 2,6,8,19,30,27.\n\nNode34: [36]\n\nNode35: [] (isolated)\n\nNode36: [34]\n\nNode37: [10,12,13,38] (edges10-37,12-37,13-37,37-38. So node37's neighbors are10,12,13,38.\n\nNode38: [11,24,37] (edges11-38,24-38,37-38. So node38's neighbors are11,24,37.\n\nOkay, now the adjacency list is built. Now, I need to assign colors 0,1,2 to each node such that adjacent nodes have different colors.\n\nLet me process nodes in order and assign the lowest possible color not used by their already colored neighbors. Since some nodes are isolated, they can be assigned color 0. For others, proceed step by step.\n\nLet's start with node0. Its neighbor is node5. Let's assign node0 color 0. Then node5 can't be 0. Assign node5 color1.\n\nBut maybe better to process nodes in order and assign colors as we go.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a large graph, maybe look for a way to group nodes into color classes.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph may have a bipartite structure, but with 3 colors, perhaps some nodes form cycles of odd length, requiring 3 colors.\n\nBut perhaps a greedy approach would work here, processing nodes in some order and assigning the first available color.\n\nLet me try to go through each node from 0 to 38 and assign colors. Let's use a dictionary to track colors assigned.\n\nInitialize all colors to -1 (unassigned).\n\nStart with node0. Neighbors: 5. Since 5 is unassigned, assign node0 color0. Then when we reach node5, assign color1.\n\nThen node1. Neighbors 28 and 26. Both unassigned. Assign color0 to node1.\n\nWait, but node1's neighbors are 28 and 26. So node1's color must differ from their colors. But since they are unassigned, assign color0 to node1. Then when we process node28 and 26, they can't be color0.\n\nBut if the processing order is 0,1,2,... then let's proceed.\n\nNode0: color0.\n\nNode1: neighbors 28 and26, both uncolored. Assign color0. But if that's possible. Then when node28 is processed, can't use 0.\n\nWait, maybe this approach will lead to conflicts later. Maybe processing in a different order would be better. For example, nodes with higher degrees first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting with the more connected nodes. For example, node33 is connected to many nodes (2,6,8,19,30,27). Let's check node33's degree. It has 6 neighbors. That's a high degree. Assigning a color to node33 first may help.\n\nBut in a greedy approach, the order can impact the number of colors needed. But since the problem states that exactly 3 colors are sufficient, and we need to find a valid 3-coloring.\n\nLet me try processing nodes in order and see.\n\nNode0: assign color0. Neighbor is node5.\n\nNode1: color0. Neighbors 28,26.\n\nNode2: neighbors 33,9. Assign color0. But then node33 and 9 can't be 0.\n\nBut node33 is connected to node2. So when we process node2, assign color0. Then node33 must not be 0.\n\nProceeding:\n\nNode0: 0.\n\nNode1: 0.\n\nNode2: 0. So node33 and9 can't be0.\n\nBut node33's color will be determined later. Let's proceed.\n\nNode3: neighbors12,26,29. Assign color0. Then 12,26,29 can't be0.\n\nNode4: neighbors15,10. Assign color0. 15 and10 can't be0.\n\nNode5: neighbor is0 (color0). Assign color1.\n\nNode6: neighbors33,26,29. Assign color0. So33,26,29 can't be0.\n\nBut node33,26,29 may have color constraints.\n\nWait, but node3 is already color0. node3's neighbors (12,26,29) can't be0. So when we process node26, it can't be0.\n\nContinuing:\n\nNode7: neighbors20,12. Assign color0.\n\nNode8: neighbors33,13. Assign color0.\n\nNode9: neighbors14,32,2 (2 is color0). Assign color1.\n\nNode10: neighbors37,4 (color0),19. Assign color1 (can't be0 because node4 is0). So node10 is1.\n\nNode11: neighbors38,28. Assign color0.\n\nNode12: neighbors28 (node1 is0, but node12 is connected to28. Wait, node12's neighbors are28,37,3,7. 3 is color0,7 is0. So node12's neighbors 3 and7 are0. So node12 can't be0. Assign color1.\n\nNode13: neighbors8 (0),31,37. Assign color1 (can't be0 due to node8).\n\nNode14: neighbors9 (1),15. Assign color0 (since 9 is1). So 15 can't be0.\n\nNode15: neighbors4 (0),29,14 (0),18. Assign color1 (can't be0 because of4 and14, which are0). So node15 is1.\n\nNode16: neighbor20. Assign color0.\n\nNode17: neighbor22. Assign color0.\n\nNode18: neighbors29,15 (1). Assign color0 (since 15 is1). So 29 can't be0.\n\nNode19: neighbors33,29,10 (1). Assign color0. So node33 and29 can't be0, and node10 is1.\n\nNode20: neighbors16 (0),7 (0),21. Assign color1 (can't be0 due to16 and7).\n\nNode21: neighbors20 (1),30. Assign color0.\n\nNode22: neighbor17 (0). Assign color1.\n\nNode23: isolated. Assign color0.\n\nNode24: neighbor38. Assign color0.\n\nNode25: isolated. Assign color0.\n\nNode26: neighbors1 (0),3 (0),6 (0). Assign color1 (since neighbors are all0).\n\nNode27: neighbor33. Assign color0.\n\nNode28: neighbors1 (0),12 (1),11 (0). So node28's neighbors are1 (0),12 (1),11 (0). So possible colors: 2. Because it can't be0 (from 1 and11) and can't be1 (from12). Assign color2.\n\nWait, node28's neighbors are1 (color0),12 (color1), and11 (color0). So node28 can't be0 or1. So color2. Assign color2.\n\nNode29: neighbors18 (0),15 (1),6 (0),3 (0),19 (0). So neighbors have colors0,1,0,0,0. So node29 can't be0 or1. Assign color2.\n\nBut wait, node29 is connected to 18 (0),15 (1),6 (0),3 (0),19 (0). So color for node29 must be different from 0,1. Assign color2.\n\nNode30: neighbors33,21 (0). 33 hasn't been colored yet. So when processing node30, what's the color? Let's see. If node21 is0, then node30 can be1 or2. But node30 is connected to33, which we need to color next.\n\nNode31: neighbor13 (1). Assign color0.\n\nNode32: neighbor9 (1). Assign color0.\n\nNode33: neighbors2 (0),6 (0),8 (0),19 (0),30 (unknown),27 (0). So node33's neighbors are2,6,8,19,27 (all0), and30 (unknown). So node33 can't be0. Assign color1. But need to check when we process node33.\n\nWait, let's track when we get to node33.\n\nProcessing order is 0 to38. So node33 is processed after nodes0-32. Let's see:\n\nAfter processing up to node32, node33 hasn't been processed yet. Let's see the current colors assigned to node33's neighbors:\n\nnode2: color0.\n\nnode6: color0.\n\nnode8: color0.\n\nnode19: color0.\n\nnode30: when we process node30, which is node30's position in the order (node30 is before 33). So let's process node30.\n\nProcessing node30: neighbors are33 (not yet processed) and21 (color0). So node30 can be assigned color1 (since neighbor21 is0). Assign color1. Then when processing node33, its neighbors include30 (color1). So node33's neighbors are2 (0),6 (0),8 (0),19 (0),30 (1),27 (0). So node33 can't be0 or1. Assign color2.\n\nBut wait, node33's neighbors have colors0 and1. So node33 must be color2.\n\nBut wait, node33's neighbors:\n\nnode2:0, node6:0, node8:0, node19:0, node30:1 (from previous step), node27:0. So node33 can't be0 or1. Assign color2.\n\nThen proceed to node34, which is connected to36. Assign color0.\n\nNode35: isolated. Assign0.\n\nNode36: neighbor34 (0). Assign1.\n\nNode37: neighbors10 (1),12 (1),13 (1),38. So node37's neighbors are10,12,13 (all1), and38 (unknown). So assign color0 (since 1 is used by neighbors). Then node38 can't be0.\n\nNode38: neighbors11 (0),24 (0),37 (0). So all neighbors are0. Assign1.\n\nNow let's check for any conflicts.\n\nLet me verify node by node.\n\nNode0: color0. Neighbor5 is1. Correct.\n\nNode1: color0. Neighbors28 (2),26 (1). Correct.\n\nNode2:0.

So, the task is to assign colors to 34 nodes (from 0 to 33) using exactly 3 colors such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. The edges provided define the connections between the nodes. I need to come up with a valid coloring scheme.\n\nFirst, I should probably list out all the edges to understand the connections better. Let me go through each edge and maybe build an adjacency list. That way, I can see which nodes are connected and need different colors.\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\n1 - 28\n25 - 29\n1 - 31\n6 - 15\n26 - 33\n3 - 16\n20 - 29\n14 - 25\n9 - 11\n17 - 24\n17 - 27\n6 - 8\n4 - 8\n23 - 30\n8 - 11\n0 - 1\n2 - 4\n3 - 27\n2 - 7\n10 - 14\n1 - 11\n1 - 5\n14 - 27\n1 - 8\n10 - 20\n6 - 7\n18 - 24\n18 - 27\n4 - 13\n3 - 17\n14 - 20\n5 - 26\n19 - 25\n0 - 15\n6 - 9\n\nHmm, that's a lot of edges. Let me try to group nodes by their connections. Maybe starting with nodes that have higher degrees first. Let's see which nodes have the most connections.\n\nLooking at the edges, node 1 is connected to 28, 31, 0, 11, 5, 8, and maybe others. Wait, let's list all the connections for each node:\n\nNode 0: connected to 1, 15\nNode 1: connected to 28, 31, 0, 11, 5, 8 (edges 0-1, 1-28, 1-31, 1-11, 1-5, 1-8)\nWait, the edges listed: 0-1, 1-28, 1-31, 1-11, 1-5, 1-8, 8-11 (but 8-11 is a separate edge). So node 1 has edges to 0,28,31,11,5,8. That's 6 connections.\n\nNode 2: connected to 4,7 (edges 2-4, 2-7)\nNode 3: connected to 16, 27, 17 (edges 3-16, 3-27, 3-17)\nNode 4: connected to 8,2,13 (edges 4-8, 2-4, 4-13)\nNode 5: connected to 1,26 (edges 1-5, 5-26)\nNode 6: connected to 15,8,7,9 (edges 6-15, 6-8, 6-7, 6-9)\nNode 7: connected to 2,6 (edges 2-7, 6-7)\nNode 8: connected to 6,4,11,1 (edges 6-8, 4-8, 8-11, 1-8)\nNode 9: connected to 11,6 (edges 9-11, 6-9)\nNode 10: connected to 14,20 (edges 10-14, 10-20)\nNode 11: connected to 9,8,1 (edges 9-11,8-11,1-11)\nNode 12: (Wait, the nodes go up to 33. Wait the nodes listed are 0 to 33. But in the edges provided, I don't see node 12 connected to anyone? Let me check the edges again. The edges given: none mention node 12. So node 12 is isolated. That's easy; it can take any color.\n\nSame for some other nodes. Let's check all nodes. The nodes are 0 through 33. Let's see which nodes are present in the edges:\n\nLooking through the edges:\n\nNode 0: yes (0-1, 0-15)\n1: yes\n2: yes (edges 2-4, 2-7)\n3: yes (3-16, 3-27, 3-17)\n4: yes\n5: yes\n6: yes\n7: yes\n8: yes\n9: yes\n10: yes (10-14, 10-20)\n11: yes\n12: not in any edge.\n13: yes (4-13)\n14: yes (14-25, 14-27, 10-14, 14-20)\n15: yes (6-15, 0-15)\n16: yes (3-16)\n17: yes (17-24,17-27,3-17)\n18: yes (18-24,18-27)\n19: yes (19-25)\n20: yes (20-29,10-20,14-20)\n21: Not in any edge. Wait the nodes listed up to 33, but in the edges, nodes 21, 22, 23? 23 is in edge 23-30. 22 isn't mentioned. Let's check again.\n\nWait, the edges list given includes:\n\n23-30, so node 23 is present. 24 is in 17-24,18-24. 25 in multiple edges. 26 connected to 33, 5. 27 connected to multiple. 28 connected to 1. 29 connected to 25,20. 30 connected to 23. 31 connected to 1. 32? No. 33 connected to 26.\n\nWait the nodes in the problem are 0,1,...33. But some nodes like 12, 21, 22, 24 (no, 24 is connected to 17 and 18), 32 (no edges), etc. Let's confirm:\n\nLooking at all edges again:\n\nNodes present in edges:\n\n0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,33.\n\nMissing nodes: 12, 21, 22, 32. So nodes 12,21,22,32 are isolated. So their colors can be any of 0,1,2 as they have no neighbors.\n\nThat simplifies things. Now, the rest of the nodes have edges.\n\nSo the plan is: assign colors to connected nodes first, then assign any color to the isolated nodes.\n\nStarting with node 1, which has many edges. Let's assign color 0 to node 1. Then its neighbors (0,28,31,5,8,11) can't be 0. Let's pick colors for them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with a node that's part of a cycle or a complex structure. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a greedy algorithm approach: process nodes in order, assigning the lowest possible color not used by their neighbors.\n\nBut since we have to use exactly 3 colors, perhaps the graph is 3-colorable. Let's proceed.\n\nLet me try to list the adjacency list for each node (excluding isolated ones):\n\nAdjacency list:\n\n0: [1,15]\n1: [0,28,31,11,5,8]\n2: [4,7]\n3: [16,27,17]\n4: [2,8,13]\n5: [1,26]\n6: [15,8,7,9]\n7: [2,6]\n8: [6,4,11,1]\n9: [11,6]\n10: [14,20]\n11: [9,8,1]\n12: []\n13: [4]\n14: [25,27,10,20]\n15: [6,0]\n16: [3]\n17: [24,27,3]\n18: [24,27]\n19: [25]\n20: [29,10,14]\n23: [30]\n24: [17,18]\n25: [29,14,19]\n26: [5,33]\n27: [3,14,17,18]\n28: [1]\n29: [25,20]\n30: [23]\n31: [1]\n32: []\n33: [26]\n\nNow, let's start assigning colors.\n\nLet's pick node 1. Assign color 0. Then all its neighbors (0,28,31,5,8,11) can't be 0.\n\nNext, let's look at node 0. Its neighbors are 1 (color 0) and 15. So node 0 can take color 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 15's neighbors are 6 and 0. 0 is color 1, so 15 can be 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nBut wait, node 6 is connected to 15. So node 6 can't be the same as 15 (which is 0). Let's see when we get to node 6.\n\nProceeding to node 28 (connected to 1). Since 1 is color 0, node 28 can be 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNode 31 (connected to 1) can be 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode 5 (connected to 1). Assign 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Then node 5's neighbor is 26. So node 26 must not be 1.\n\nNode 8 (connected to 1). Assign 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Now, node 8's neighbors are 6,4,11,1. So node 6,4,11 can't be 1 if node 8 is 1. Wait, but node 8 is assigned 1 here. Wait, no: if node 8 is color 1, then its neighbors (6,4,11,1) can't be 1. Since node 1 is color 0, that's okay. So node 8's color is 1. So its neighbors (6,4,11) must be different.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to process nodes in order and choose the first available color.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a backtracking approach, but that's time-consuming manually. Since this is a manual process, perhaps pick nodes and assign colors step by step.\n\nLet me try to list the nodes in order and assign colors as I go, keeping track of adjacent colors.\n\nStart with node 0:\n\n- Node 0: neighbors are 1 and 15. Let's assign color 1. So [0,1].\n\nNode 1: must be different from 0. Assign color 0. [1,0].\n\nNode 2: neighbors are 4 and 7. Let's assign color 0. [2,0].\n\nBut wait, node 4 and 7 are neighbors. Let's process node 4 next.\n\nNode 4: connected to 2,8,13. Node 2 is color 0. So node 4 can't be 0. Assign 1. [4,1].\n\nThen node 8, connected to 4 (1), 6, 11, 1 (0). So node 8 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2. [8,2].\n\nNode 8's color is 2. Then its neighbors:\n\n- node 6: must not be 2.\n\n- node 4: color 1, so okay.\n\n- node 11: can't be 2.\n\n- node 1: color 0, okay.\n\nProceed to node 6: connected to 15,8,7,9. Node 15's color is not yet assigned. Node 8 is 2. So node 6 can't be 2. Let's assign color 0. [6,0].\n\nNode 15: connected to 6 (0) and 0 (1). So can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2. [15,2].\n\nNow, node 7: neighbors 2 (0) and 6 (0). So can't be 0. Assign 1. [7,1].\n\nNode 9: connected to 11 and 6 (0). So can't be 0. Assign 1. [9,1].\n\nNode 11: connected to 9 (1), 8 (2), and 1 (0). So node 11 can't be 0,1,2. Wait, that's a problem. All colors are used by neighbors. But 9 is 1, 8 is 2, and 1 is 0. So all three colors are taken. This is a conflict. So this path doesn't work. Therefore, the color assignments I made so far are causing a conflict at node 11.\n\nHmm, so this approach has a problem. Let's backtrack.\n\nWhere did the conflict happen? Let's re-examine.\n\nNode 8 was assigned color 2. Node 9 is connected to node 6 (color 0) and node 11. Node 11 is connected to 9,8 (color 2), and 1 (color 0). So when node 11 is to be colored, its neighbors are 9 (unknown yet), 8 (2), and 1 (0). If node 9 is colored 1, then node 11 can't be 0,2,1? Wait, 9 is 1, 8 is 2, 1 is 0. So node 11 can't take any color. That's a problem.\n\nTherefore, the assignment of node 8 to color 2 is causing a conflict. Let's see where else that could have been avoided.\n\nLet me start again. Maybe assign node 8 a different color.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nNode 0: color 1.\n\nNode 1: color 0.\n\nNode 2: color 0.\n\nNode 4: connected to 2 (0). Assign color 1.\n\nNode 8: connected to 4 (1) and node 1 (0). So possible colors for 8: 2. Assign 2.\n\nNode 6: connected to 8 (2). So possible colors 0 or 1.\n\nLet's assign node 6 color 0. Then node 15 (connected to 6) can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nBut node 15 is connected to node 0 (1). So node 15 can't be 1. So color 0 or 2. Wait, node 6 is color 0, so node 15 can't be 0. So must be 2. [15,2].\n\nNode 7: connected to 2 (0) and 6 (0). So assign 1. [7,1].\n\nNode 9: connected to 6 (0) and 11. Assign color 1. [9,1].\n\nNode 11: connected to 9 (1), 8 (2), and 1 (0). So available color is none. Conflict again.\n\nHmm. So regardless of node 6's color, node 8's color being 2 leads to node 11 having no available color.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps node 8 should not be color 2. Let's try assigning node 8 a different color.\n\nWait, node 8's neighbors are 1 (0), 4 (1), 6, and 11. If node 8 is color 2, then 6 and 11 can't be 2. But if node 8 is color 0, but node 1 is already color 0. So that's not allowed. So node 8 can't be 0. So possible colors 1 or 2.\n\nWait, node 8 is connected to node 1 (color 0), so node 8 can be 1 or 2.\n\nIf node 8 is color 1, then node 4 (color 1) is a neighbor. So that's invalid. Because node 4 is already color 1. So node 8 can't be 1. Therefore, node 8 must be 2. But then we end up with the conflict at node 11.\n\nWait, but node 4 is color 1. So node 8 can't be 1 (since connected to node 4). So node 8 must be 2. But then node 11 connected to node 8 (2) and node 1 (0), and node 9 (1). So node 11 cannot take any color. Therefore, this implies that the initial color assignments are leading to a conflict. So perhaps the problem is the color assigned to node 9.\n\nIf node 9 is assigned a different color. Let's see: node 9 is connected to node 6 and 11. If node 6 is color 0, then node 9 can be 1 or 2. Suppose we assign node 9 color 2. Then node 11 is connected to node 9 (2), node 8 (2), which is not allowed. Wait, node 8 is 2, so node 11 can't be 2. If node 9 is 2, then node 11's neighbors are 9 (2), 8 (2), and 1 (0). So node 11 can't be 0 or 2. So color 1. But then node 11 can be color 1. Wait, let's try that.\n\nLet's adjust:\n\nNode 9: color 2. [9,2].\n\nThen node 11's neighbors are 9 (2), 8 (2), and 1 (0). So node 11 can't be 2 or 0. So color 1. Assign [11,1].\n\nDoes that work? Node 11's neighbors:\n\n- node 9: 2.\n\n- node 8: 2.\n\n- node 1: 0.\n\nSo color 1 is allowed. Yes. So maybe this approach works.\n\nSo let's retrace:\n\nNode 0:1, node 1:0.\n\nNode 2:0.\n\nNode4:1.\n\nNode8:2.\n\nNode6:0.\n\nNode15:2.\n\nNode7:1.\n\nNode9:2.\n\nNode11:1.\n\nNow, node 11 is color 1. That's okay.\n\nSo now, proceeding.\n\nNext, node 5: connected to node 1 (0). Assign 1. [5,1].\n\nNode5's neighbor 26: can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2.\n\nNode26: connected to 5 (1) and 33. Assign 0.

But the problem says to use exactly 3 colors. Assigning them 0 is acceptable as they have no edges.\n\nSo the final coloring would include all nodes. Let's compile the list:\n\n[\n[0,1],\n[1,0],\n[2,0],\n[3,0],\n[4,1],\n[5,1],\n[6,0],\n[7,1],\n[8,2],\n[9,2],\n[10,1],\n[11,1],\n[12,0],\n[13,0],\n[14,0],\n[15,2],\n[16,1],\n[17,1],\n[18,1],\n[19,0],\n[20,2],\n[21,0],\n[22,0],\n[23,0],\n[24,0],\n[25,1],\n[26,0],\n[27,2],\n[28,1],\n[29,0],\n[30,1],\n[31,1],\n[32,0],\n[33,1]\n]\n\nNow, let's verify that all edges are satisfied.

The isolated nodes have color 0, which is acceptable. This should be a valid 3-coloring.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0,1],[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[4,1],[5,1],[6,0],[7,1],[8,2],[9,2],[10,1],[11,1],[12,0],[13,0],[14,0],[15,2],[16,1],[17,1],[18,1],[19,0],[20,2],[21,0],[22,0],[23,0],[24,0],[25,1],[26,0],[27,2],[28,1],[29,0],[30,1],[31,1],[32,0],[33,1]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

Let me start by understanding the structure. The graph has nodes from 0 to 49, and there's a list of edges. My goal is to assign each node a color from 0, 1, or 2 such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.\n\nFirst, I should list out all the edges and maybe visualize or note the connections. But since there are 50 nodes, that might be tedious. Maybe I can approach this systematically by building an adjacency list. Let's see.\n\nLet me start by creating an adjacency list for each node. That way, I can track which nodes are connected and ensure that their colors don't clash.\n\nLooking at the edges provided:\n\nFor example, node 41 is connected to 43 and 45. Node 10 is connected to 40, 15, 48, 23. Node 2 is connected to 42, 46, and 1. Wait, the edge list says 1-2, 2-46, 2-42. So node 2 is connected to 1, 42, 46. Got it.\n\nI think building the adjacency list step by step is the way to go. Let me list all edges:\n\n- 41 -43\n-10-40\n-2-42\n-6-24\n-13-42\n-16-38\n-5-13\n-22-23\n-17-21\n-17-24\n-0-17\n-10-15\n-27-37\n-4-45\n-5-34\n-14-49\n-34-46\n-15-17\n-6-14\n-24-29\n-41-45\n-5-6\n-10-48\n-29-34\n-18-40\n-5-18\n-29-40\n-8-14\n-6-47\n-1-2\n-9-13\n-12-36\n-21-48\n-23-39\n-4-38\n-10-23\n-17-44\n-7-24\n-1-38\n-43-47\n-1-47\n-2-46\n-12-35\n-14-32\n-14-26\n-34-44\n-28-37\n-5-35\n-27-44\n\nHmm. Now, perhaps I should create the adjacency list. Let me proceed:\n\nAdjacency list (each node's neighbors):\n\n0: [17]\n1: [2, 38, 47]\n2: [1, 42, 46]\n3: ? Wait, no edges listed for node 3. Let me check. The edges provided don't mention node 3. So node 3 has no edges. Similarly, node 4 is connected to 45 and 38. Node5 is connected to 13, 34, 18, 6, 35. Node6: 24, 14, 47,5,29? Wait, edges: 6-24,6-14,5-6,6-47. So node6 connected to 24,14,5,47. And also 5-6. Node5 is connected to 6. So node6's neighbors: 24,14,5,47. Also, edge 6-47. So node6's neighbors are 24,14,5,47. And 5's neighbors: 13,34,18,6,35,29-34? Wait, 5-34, 5-18, 5-6, 5-35. Also, edge 5-13, 5-34,5-18,5-6,5-35. So node5's neighbors:13,34,18,6,35.\n\nThis is going to take a while. Maybe I can start by looking for nodes that have the most connections, as those might be the most constrained and need to be colored first. Let's see.\n\nLooking through the edges, perhaps node14 is connected to 6,49,8,32,26, etc. Let's check the edges. Edges for node14: 14-49 (from the edge list), 6-14,8-14,14-32,14-26. So node14's neighbors are 6,49,8,32,26. So that's five neighbors. Node10 has edges: 10-40,10-15,10-48,10-23. So four neighbors. Node5 has multiple edges: connected to 13,34,18,6,35. That's five. Node17 is connected to 21,24,0,15,44. So five neighbors (17-21,17-24,0-17,15-17,17-44). So node17 has five. Node34 is connected to 5,46,44,29,40. Let's see: 5-34,34-46,34-44,29-34,29-40 (but 29 is connected to 34 and 40). So node34's neighbors are 5,46,44,29. Wait, 34 is connected to 5,46,44,29. Hmm. So four neighbors. So maybe nodes like 5, 14,17 have higher degrees. Starting with those.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps node6 is connected to 24,14,5,47. Four neighbors. So perhaps node14 is a high-degree node. Let's try to color these high-degree nodes first.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Assign colors to high-degree nodes first, ensuring their neighbors get different colors.\n2. Proceed through the graph, assigning colors while checking conflicts.\n\nBut since the graph might be disconnected (some nodes may not have edges), we can color those as needed.\n\nBut since we have to use exactly 3 colors, but not necessarily all three, but in this case, since the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\", but the coloring must be valid. However, the question states \"using exactly 3 colors\", but perhaps that just means that at least one node uses each color. Wait, no. Wait, the exact wording is \"using exactly 3 colors\". Oh, but in graph coloring, using exactly 3 colors just means that the coloring uses three colors, not that all three are used. Wait, but the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors (colors are numbered from 0 to 2)\". So the colors available are 0,1,2, and we must use exactly 3 colors. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the colors are numbered 0-2, so exactly three colors, and the solution must use those three. So the answer must assign each node a color from 0,1,2, such that adjacent nodes have different colors. So the answer must be a valid 3-coloring.\n\nSo the main task is to assign colors without conflicts, using 3 colors.\n\nOne approach is to model this as a graph and perform a backtracking search, but given the size (50 nodes), that's impractical. Instead, perhaps a greedy approach with ordering.\n\nAnother approach is to check whether the graph is bipartite, but since 3 colors are needed, it's possible that the graph is not bipartite. For example, if there's a cycle of odd length, which requires 3 colors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the graph can be colored using a sequential ordering, assigning each node the smallest possible color not used by its already-colored neighbors.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps a better way is to construct the adjacency list, then proceed node by node, assigning colors in a way that avoids conflicts.\n\nBut given that the user needs a JSON list of pairs, and the answer must be accurate, perhaps I can approach this by looking for a possible 3-coloring through some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the graph is structured in a way that allows for a systematic coloring. Let's look for connected components. For example, if the graph is connected, then the coloring can be done for the whole. Otherwise, each component can be colored separately.\n\nBut given the edge list, I can see that nodes like 3, maybe 3 is isolated. Let's check. The edges don't mention node3. So node3 has no edges and can be colored 0. Similarly, other nodes may be isolated. For example, node 11: not mentioned in any edge. So node 11 is isolated. Also, nodes like 19, 20, 25, 30, 31, 33, etc. Wait, checking the list of edges, I don't see nodes like 19, 20, 25, 30, etc. So these nodes are isolated. So for them, any color is acceptable.\n\nSo the strategy can be:\n\n- Color all isolated nodes with 0, 1, or 2 as needed, but since they have no edges, any color is fine. But since we can use exactly three colors, perhaps alternate their colors for uniformity, but it's not necessary. However, for simplicity, perhaps color all isolated nodes with 0.\n\nFor connected nodes:\n\nLet's pick a starting node and assign it a color, then color its neighbors with different colors, proceeding in a breadth-first manner, ensuring no conflicts.\n\nBut perhaps this is a bit time-consuming. Let me try to model some parts.\n\nFor example, let's look at the edges involving node 0. Node0 is connected to 17. So 0 and 17 must have different colors. Let's assign node0 color 0. Then node17 must be 1 or 2. Suppose node17 is 1. Then its neighbors (21,24,0,15,44) must not be 1.\n\nNode17's neighbors: 21,24,0,15,44. So 0 is color 0. So node17 can be 1.\n\nThen node21 (connected to 17 and 48) must not be 1. Assign 21 to 0. Then 48 (connected to 21 and 10) must not be 0. Assign 48 to 1. Then node10 is connected to 48 (so must not be 1), 40,15,23. Let's assign node10 color 2.\n\nBut this could get complicated. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet's choose node0, assign color 0. Its only neighbor is node17. Assign node17 color 1. Then node17's neighbors (21,24,15,44, etc.) must not be color 1.\n\nNext, node21: connected to 17 (color1) and 48. Assign 21 color 0. Node48 is connected to 21 (color0) and 10. So node48 can be color1. Then node10 is connected to 48 (color1) and 40,15,23. Assign node10 color0. But then check if that conflicts with other edges.\n\nWait, node10 is connected to 40,15,23,48. So node10 can't be the same as 48 (1), so possible colors: 0 or 2. If node10 is 0, then node40 (connected to10) must be 1 or 2. Let's assign node40 color1. Then node18 is connected to40 (color1) and 5. So node18 must not be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Let's see.\n\nThis approach may take a long time. Alternatively, perhaps using a backtracking algorithm in code would be ideal, but since I'm doing this manually, I need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the graph can be colored using a repeating pattern of 0,1,2,0,1,2... but ensuring that adjacent nodes are different. However, given that the graph structure isn't regular, this may not work.\n\nAlternatively, look for cycles. For example, if there's a triangle (cycle of 3 nodes), then 3 colors are needed. Let me check the edges for any triangles.\n\nLooking at edges:\n\nFor example, node5 is connected to 6,13,34,18,35. Are any of these nodes connected to each other? Let's see:\n\n5-6: 6 is connected to 24,14,47. Not sure. Maybe not a triangle.\n\nNode17 is connected to 21,24,0,15,44. Any edges between 21 and 24? Not listed. So no triangle there.\n\nNode10 is connected to 40,15,48,23. Are 15 and 40 connected? Not directly. So no triangle.\n\nAlternatively, node5-6-14: 5 is connected to6, 6 to14. Is 5 connected to14? No. So no triangle.\n\nHmm. Maybe there are no triangles, which would imply that the graph is 2-colorable. But then why does the problem ask for 3 colors? Maybe there is an odd-length cycle, requiring 3 colors.\n\nWait, if the graph is bipartite, then 2 colors would suffice. If not, then 3. The presence of an odd-length cycle would make it non-bipartite, requiring 3 colors.\n\nSo first, I need to check if the graph is bipartite. If it is, then 2 colors would work. But since the problem requires exactly 3, perhaps it's not bipartite, and I need to find where the odd cycle is.\n\nLooking for cycles:\n\nLet's take a path and see if it forms a cycle. For example, starting at node5:\n\n5 is connected to 6. 6 is connected to 24. 24 is connected to 17 and 29. 17 is connected to 0, 21, 15,44. Let's see:\n\n5 →6 →24 →17 →0 (no edges back to 5). Not a cycle.\n\nAnother path: 5 →6 →24 →29 →34 →5. Wait, 5 connected to34, which is connected to29, which is connected to24, which is connected to6, which is connected to5. So this forms a cycle:5-6-24-29-34-5. Let's count the length:5,6 (1),24 (2),29 (3),34 (4),5 (5). So a cycle of length 5. That's an odd cycle. So the graph contains a 5-node cycle, which is odd. Hence, the graph is not bipartite and requires at least 3 colors. So using 3 colors is necessary.\n\nTherefore, the graph is 3-colorable. So the problem is to find a valid 3-coloring.\n\nNow, for such a cycle (5-6-24-29-34-5), each consecutive node must alternate colors, but since the cycle is odd, the first and last nodes (5 and34) would have the same color if using two colors. Hence, three colors are needed. Let's try to assign colors to this cycle.\n\nAssign color 0 to node5. Then node6 must be 1. Node24 must be 0 (since it's adjacent to6). Node29 must be1 (adjacent to24). Node34 must be0 (adjacent to29). But node5 and34 are connected (edge 5-34), so they can't both be 0. So this leads to a conflict. Hence, the need for a third color.\n\nSo in this cycle, one of the nodes must be colored with the third color. Let's see how to assign.\n\nLet me try:\n\nNode5:0\n\nNode6:1 (since adjacent to5)\n\nNode24:2 (adjacent to6, can't be1)\n\nNode29:0 (adjacent to24, can't be2)\n\nNode34:1 (adjacent to29, can't be0)\n\nNow, node5 is connected to34. Node5 is 0, node34 is1. That's okay. So this cycle can be colored with 3 colors as follows:\n\n5:0, 6:1, 24:2, 29:0,34:1.\n\nThis works. So that's one way to handle the cycle.\n\nNow, proceeding from there, we can color other nodes accordingly.\n\nSo perhaps starting with this cycle and assigning colors as above, then proceeding to color adjacent nodes.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, color the cycle 5-6-24-29-34-5.\n\nAssign:\n\n5:0\n\n6:1 (adjacent to5)\n\n24: can't be1. Assign 2.\n\n29: adjacent to24 (2) → assign 0.\n\n34: adjacent to29 (0) → assign1. Now, 34 is adjacent to5 (0) → okay.\n\nSo the cycle is colored without conflict.\n\nNow, node5 has neighbors 6,13,18,34,35.\n\nWe've colored 6 and34. So 13,18,35 need to be colored.\n\nLet's look at node13. It's connected to5 (0), 42,9. Assign node13 a color different from5. Possible 1 or 2.\n\nBut let's see. For now, node13 is connected to5 (0). Let's assign node13:1.\n\nThen node42 (connected to13 and2). Assign 42 a color different from13 (1). So 0 or2.\n\nBut node2 is connected to42 (edge 2-42). So the color of 2 and42 must differ.\n\nLet's handle node2. Node2 is connected to1,42,46.\n\nAssuming node2 is part of another subgraph. Let's first color node2.\n\nAssuming node1 is connected to2,38,47. So node1's color affects node2.\n\nLet's proceed.\n\nBut maybe it's better to color nodes in the order of their degrees. Let's proceed.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed in the order of the nodes, coloring them one by one and keeping track of used colors.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let's try to proceed systematically.\n\nFirst, color the cycle:\n\n5:0\n\n6:1\n\n24:2\n\n29:0\n\n34:1\n\nNow, look at other nodes connected to these.\n\nNode5's neighbors:6 (1),13,18,34 (1),35.\n\nSo for node13 (connected to5 (0)), possible colors:1,2.\n\nAssign node13:1.\n\nBut then node42 (connected to13) must not be1. Let's assign node42:2.\n\nNode2 is connected to42 (2). So node2 can't be2. Assign 0 or1.\n\nNode2 is also connected to1 and46.\n\nAssume node2 is assigned color0. Then node1 (connected to2) can't be0. Assign node1:1.\n\nNode1 is connected to38 and47. Assign node1:1.\n\nThen node38 (connected to1) can't be1. Assign 0 or2.\n\nNode4 is connected to38 (edge4-38). So node4's color depends on node38's color.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too tangled. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed with the nodes in order and assign colors as we go, keeping track of conflicts.\n\nOrder:0,1,2,3,...49.\n\nBut perhaps starting with the cycle we identified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a greedy coloring algorithm with a specific order, like ordering nodes by degree descending, but given time constraints, perhaps proceed manually.\n\nLet me attempt to color the nodes step by step:\n\n1. Node5:0\n\n2. Node6:1 (connected to5)\n\n3. Node24:2 (connected to6)\n\n4. Node29:0 (connected to24)\n\n5. Node34:1 (connected to29 and5)\n\n6. Node13: connected to5 (0) → can be 1 or2. Assign 1.\n\n7. Node9: connected to13 (1) → assign 0 or2. Assign 0.\n\n8. Node42: connected to13 (1) and2. So if node42 is assigned 2, then node2 (connected to42) can't be2. Assign node42:2.\n\n9. Node2: connected to42 (2) → color 0 or1. Let's choose 0.\n\n10. Node1: connected to2 (0) → color1 or2. Assign1.\n\n11. Node38: connected to1 (1) and4. Assign 0 or2. Assign0.\n\n12. Node4: connected to38 (0) and45 (from edge4-45). Assign color1.\n\n13. Node45: connected to4 (1) and41. Assign0 or2. Assign0.\n\n14. Node41: connected to45 (0) and43. Assign1.\n\n15. Node43: connected to41 (1) and47. Assign0 or2. Assign0.\n\n16. Node47: connected to43 (0) and1 (1),6 (1). Node47's neighbors are 43 (0),1 (1),6 (1). So possible colors:2.\n\nAssign node47:2.\n\n17. Node6 is already 1. Node47 is 2. So okay.\n\n18. Node1 is 1. Node47 is 2. Okay.\n\n19. Node43 is 0. Node47 is2. Okay.\n\n20. Node38 is0. Node4 is1. Node16 is connected to38 (0). Assign node16:1 or2. Assign1.\n\n21. Node16:1.\n\n22. Node38:0. Node1:1. Node4:1. Node16:1.\n\n23. Node7: connected to24 (2). Assign color0 or1. Assign0.\n\n24. Node24 is2. Node7 is0. Okay.\n\n25. Node17: connected to0 (we haven't colored node0 yet?), and others. Let's handle node0.\n\n26. Node0: connected to17. Let's assign node0:0. Then node17 must be 1 or2.\n\n27. Node17: connected to0 (0),21,24 (2),15,44. So node17 can't be0 or2 (if adjacent to24). Wait, node24 is2, so node17 can't be2. So node17 must be1.\n\nAssign node17:1.\n\n28. Node17:1. Now its neighbors (0,21,24,15,44) must avoid color1.\n\n29. Node21: connected to17 (1) and48. Assign color0 or2. Assign0.\n\n30. Node48: connected to21 (0) and10 (we haven't colored 10 yet). So node10 is connected to48 and others. Let's assign node10:2.\n\n31. Node10:2. Its neighbors are40,15,23,48.\n\n32. Node48: connected to10 (2) and21 (0). Assign node48:1.\n\n33. Node48:1. Okay.\n\n34. Node21:0. Node48:1. Okay.\n\n35. Node10:2. Now, its neighbors (40,15,23,48) must be different from2.\n\n36. Node40: connected to10 (2),18,29 (0). Assign color1.\n\n37. Node18: connected to40 (1),5 (0). Assign color2.\n\n38. Node5:0. Node18:2. Okay.\n\n39. Node29:0. Node40:1. Okay.\n\n40. Node15: connected to10 (2) and17 (1). Assign color0.\n\n41. Node15:0. Now its neighbors are10 (2),17 (1). Okay.\n\n42. Node44: connected to17 (1) and34 (1). Assign color0 or2. But node34 is1. So node44 can be0 or2. Let's assign0.\n\n43. Node34:1. Node44:0. Okay.\n\n44. Node23: connected to10 (2),39. Assign color0 or1. Assign0.\n\n45. Node39: connected to23 (0). Assign1 or2. Assign1.\n\n46. Node22: connected to23 (0). Assign1 or2. Assign1.\n\n47. Node22:1. Node23:0. Okay.\n\n48. Node7:0. Connected to24 (2). Okay.\n\n49. Node8: connected to14. Let's proceed to node14.\n\n50. Node14: connected to6 (1),49,8,32,26.\n\nAssign node14:0 (since connected to6 (1)).\n\n51. Node49: connected to14 (0). Assign1 or2. Assign1.\n\n52. Node8: connected to14 (0). Assign1 or2. Assign1.\n\n53. Node32: connected to14 (0). Assign1 or2. Assign1.\n\n54. Node26: connected to14 (0). Assign1 or2. Assign1.\n\n55. Node14:0. Its neighbors are6 (1),49 (1),8 (1),32 (1),26 (1). All okay.\n\n56. Node9: connected to13 (1). Assign0 or2. Earlier, we assigned node9:0. So that's okay.\n\n57. Node36: connected to12. Let's handle node12.\n\n58. Node12: connected to36 and35. Node35 is connected to5 (0). Assign node12:1 or2.\n\nAssign node12:1. Then node35: connected to5 (0) and12 (1). Assign2.\n\n59. Node35:2. Node5:0. Node12:1. Okay.\n\n60. Node36: connected to12 (1). Assign0 or2. Assign0.\n\n61. Node27: connected to37 and44 (0). Assign1 or2. Assign1.\n\n62. Node37: connected to27 (1) and28. Assign0 or2. Assign0.\n\n63. Node28: connected to37 (0). Assign1 or2.

I need to color a graph with nodes 0 to 11 using exactly 3 colors. The edges given are:\n\n10-11, 1-2, 6-8, 0-9, 5-7, 7-9, 1-7, 8-9, 0-2, 2-6, 5-9, 2-11, 7-8.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges to understand the connections better. Maybe drawing a small diagram would help visualize the nodes and their adjacents. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the edges, some nodes are connected to multiple others. For example, node 2 is connected to 1, 6, 0, 11. Node 7 is connected to 5,9,1,8. Node 9 is connected to 0,7,8,5. Node 8 is connected to 6,9,7. Node 11 is connected to 10 and 2. Node 6 is connected to 2 and 8. Node 5 is connected to 7 and 9. Node 1 is connected to 2 and 7. Node 0 is connected to 9 and 2. Node 10 is connected to 11. \n\nSo the plan is to assign colors (0,1,2) such that no adjacent nodes share the same color. Let's start by assigning colors step by step. \n\nPerhaps pick a node with high degree first. Let's check the degrees:\n\nNode 9: connected to 0,5,7,8 → degree 4.\n\nNode 7: connected to 5,9,1,8 → degree 4.\n\nNode 2: connected to 0,1,6,11 → degree 4.\n\nNode 8: connected to 6,9,7 → degree 3.\n\nNodes 5,6,1,0,11: degree 2 each.\n\nNodes 3 and 4 are not listed in edges, so they must be isolated. Wait, the nodes are 0-11, so are nodes 3 and 4 present but have no edges? The problem statement says the nodes are 0,1,...,11, so yes, nodes 3 and 4 are part of the graph but have no edges. That's important because they can be colored with any color, but since the problem requires using exactly 3 colors, they can be assigned any of the 3, but perhaps to minimize the total colors, but here it's fixed at 3. So for them, any color is okay.\n\nSo nodes 3 and 4 are isolated. Let's note that. So their color can be 0,1, or 2, doesn't matter as long as the total colors used are 3. Since exactly 3 colors must be used, but the problem says \"using exactly 3 colors\", which probably means that all three colors must be used in the coloring. Wait, the question says \"using exactly 3 colors\". So I have to make sure that all three colors are used in the coloring. So even though nodes 3 and 4 can take any color, I need to ensure that all three colors are present in the final assignment. So maybe they can be used to cover any missing colors if needed.\n\nBut first, let's focus on the connected nodes.\n\nLet's start with the nodes that have the highest degree. Let's pick node 9. Assign color 0. Then its neighbors (0,5,7,8) can't be 0.\n\nNext, look at node 7. It's connected to 5,9,1,8. Since 9 is color 0, 7 can't be 0. Let's assign color 1 to node 7. Then its neighbors (5,9,1,8) can't be 1. So 5 and 8 can't be 1. But 9 is already 0, so 5 and 8 can't be 0 or 1? Wait, no: node 5 is connected to 7 (color 1) and 9 (color 0). So node 5 must be colored differently from both 1 and 0. So possible color is 2. Let's assign color 2 to node 5.\n\nThen node 5's neighbors are 7 (1) and 9 (0). So 5 is 2, which is okay.\n\nNext, node 8 is connected to 6,9,7. 9 is 0, 7 is 1. So 8 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2. Wait, but then node 8 is color 2, which is okay. Let's check. So 8 is 2. Then its neighbors are 6,9 (0), and 7 (1). So 8's color is 2, which is valid.\n\nNow, node 6 is connected to 2 and 8 (color 2). So 6 can't be 2. Let's assign color 0. Wait, node 6's neighbors are 2 and 8. So if 6 is 0, that's okay as long as 2 and 8 are not 0. 8 is 2, so okay. Node 2's color hasn't been assigned yet. So 6 is color 0. Then node 2 is connected to 0,1,6,11. Node 6 is 0, so 2 can't be 0. Let's assign color 1 to node 2. Then check its neighbors:\n\n0: connected to 9 (0) and 2 (1). So node 0 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2. But node 0 is connected to 9 (0) and 2 (1). So color 2 is okay for node 0. So node 0 is 2.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 2 (1) and 7 (1). So node 1 can't be 1. Assign color 0. But check its other edges. Node 1's edges are 2 (1) and 7 (1). So 1 can't be 1. Assign color 0. Then node 1 is 0.\n\nNode 2's color is 1, connected to 0 (2), 1 (0), 6 (0), 11. So okay for now. Then node 11 is connected to 10 and 2 (1). So node 11 can't be 1. Assign color 0. Then node 10 is connected to 11 (0), so node 10 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Then node 10 is 1.\n\nNow, nodes 3 and 4 are isolated. They can be assigned any color, but since we need to use all three colors, maybe assign them different colors. Let's check which colors have been used so far:\n\nColors used: 0 (nodes 9,1,11), 1 (7,2,10), 2 (5,8,0). So all three colors are used. So nodes 3 and 4 can be any color. Let's assign them color 0 and 1 for simplicity. For example, node 3: 0, node 4:1.\n\nWait, but maybe check again for any conflicts. Let's go through each node and their edges:\n\nNode 0: color 2. Connected to 9 (0) and 2 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 1: color 0. Connected to 2 (1) and 7 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 2: color 1. Connected to 0 (2),1 (0),6 (0),11 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 3: no edges. Color 0.\n\nNode 4: no edges. Color 1.\n\nNode 5: color 2. Connected to 7 (1) and 9 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 6: color 0. Connected to 2 (1) and 8 (2). Correct.\n\nNode 7: color 1. Connected to 5 (2),9 (0),1 (0),8 (2). Correct.\n\nNode 8: color 2. Connected to 6 (0),9 (0),7 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 9: color 0. Connected to 0 (2),5 (2),7 (1),8 (2). Correct.\n\nNode 10: color 1. Connected to 11 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 11: color 0. Connected to 10 (1), 2 (1). Correct.\n\nWait, node 11 is connected to 2 (color 1), so 11's color 0 is okay. And 10 is 1, connected to 11 (0), correct.\n\nYes, this seems to work. All adjacent nodes have different colors, and all three colors (0,1,2) are used. So nodes 3 and 4 are 0 and 1, but actually, node 3 and 4 can be any color. Alternatively, I can assign node 3 as 2 and node 4 as 2, but since the problem says to use exactly 3 colors, but maybe it's sufficient that the three colors are used somewhere, regardless of isolated nodes. But in the current assignment, all three colors are already used, so even if nodes 3 and 4 are 0 and 0, it's okay. Let's just assign them 0 and 1 as earlier.\n\nSo the final coloring would be:\n\n[[0,2], [1,0], [2,1], [3,0], [4,1], [5,2], [6,0], [7,1], [8,2], [9,0], [10,1], [11,0]]\n\nLet me check for any mistakes again. Let's look at each node's edges:\n\nNode 0-9: 0 is 2, 9 is 0 → okay.\n\nNode 0-2: 0 is 2, 2 is 1 → okay.\n\nNode 1-2: 1 is 0, 2 is 1 → okay.\n\nNode 1-7: 1 is 0, 7 is 1 → okay.\n\nNode 2-6: 2 is 1, 6 is 0 → okay.\n\nNode 2-11: 2 is 1, 11 is 0 → okay.\n\nNode 5-7: 5 is 2,7 is 1 → okay.\n\nNode 5-9: 5 is 2,9 is 0 → okay.\n\nNode 6-8: 6 is 0,8 is 2 → okay.\n\nNode 7-8: 7 is 1,8 is 2 → okay.\n\nNode 7-9: 7 is 1,9 is 0 → okay.\n\nNode 8-9: 8 is 2,9 is 0 → okay.\n\nNode 10-11: 10 is 1,11 is 0 → okay.\n\nAll edges are properly colored. Isolated nodes 3 and 4 can be colored 0 and 1 as assigned, which are valid. And all three colors (0,1,2) are used. So this should be a valid coloring.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0,2],[1,0],[2,1],[3,0],[4,1],[5,2],[6,0],[7,1],[8,2],[9,0],[10,1],[11,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the graph based on the edges provided. The nodes are from 0 to 35, which is 36 nodes in total. The edges are listed, so maybe I should visualize or create an adjacency list to see the connections better.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges. Let's see:\n\n6-18, 2-27, 6-24, 4-6, 7-32, 4-21, 12-22, 4-18, 9-14, 0-14, 0-11, 0-35, 7-25, 20-22, 14-18, 7-34, 3-15, 23-30, 29-34, 18-34, 4-17, 0-7, 3-30, 17-20, 3-27, 10-17, 1-14, 7-9, 24-25, 19-32, 2-22, 6-10, 21-23, 29-30, 8-16, 11-24, 2-21, 7-14.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some when reading. Let me check again. The original list is:\n\nEdges:\n6 - 18\n2 - 27\n6 - 24\n4 - 6\n7 - 32\n4 - 21\n12 - 22\n4 - 18\n9 - 14\n0 - 14\n0 - 11\n0 - 35\n7 - 25\n20 - 22\n14 - 18\n7 - 34\n3 - 15\n23 - 30\n29 - 34\n18 - 34\n4 - 17\n0 - 7\n3 - 30\n17 - 20\n3 - 27\n10 - 17\n1 - 14\n7 - 9\n24 - 25\n19 - 32\n2 - 22\n6 - 10\n21 - 23\n29 - 30\n8 - 16\n11 - 24\n2 - 21\n7 - 14\n\nOkay, that's 39 edges. Now, let's start building adjacency lists for each node. But maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can look for nodes with high degrees since they might be more constrained.\n\nLooking at the edges, node 4 is connected to 6, 21, 18, 17. Node 6 is connected to 18,24,4,10. Node 7 has multiple connections: 32,25,34,0,9,14. Node 0 is connected to 14,11,35,7. Node 14 is connected to 9,0,18,1,7. Node 2 is connected to 27,22,21. Node 3 is connected to 15,30,27. Node 17 is connected to 4,20,10. Node 18 is connected to 6,4,14,34,10. Node 34 is connected to 7,29,18. Node 7 also connects to 32,25,34,9, etc.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should start by coloring nodes with the highest degree first. Let's check degrees:\n\nFor example:\n\nNode 7 has edges with 32,25,34,0,9,14, and also 7-9, 7-14, 7-34, 7-32, 7-25, 0-7, 7-9. Wait, let's count all edges involving node 7:\n\nEdges from the list:\n\n7 - 32\n\n7 - 25\n\n7 - 34\n\n0 - 7\n\n7 - 9\n\n7 - 14\n\nSo that's 6 edges. So node 7 has degree 6.\n\nSimilarly, node 4 has edges with 6,21,18,17, so 4 edges. Node 14 has edges with 9,0,18,1,7 (5 edges). Node 0 has 4 edges (14,11,35,7). Node 18 has 6,4,14,34,10 (5 edges). Node 2 has 27,22,21 (3 edges). Node 17 has 4,20,10 (3 edges). Node 34 has 7,29,18 (3 edges). Node 10 has 6,17,18 (3 edges). \n\nSo node 7 has the highest degree (6), so maybe start with that. Assign color 0 to node 7. Then, all adjacent nodes (32,25,34,0,9,14) cannot be color 0.\n\nNext, let's look at node 4. It's connected to 6,21,18,17. Let's assign color 0 to node 4? Wait, but node 4 isn't connected to node 7. Wait, node 4's edges are 6, 21, 18, 17. Let me check if any of these are adjacent to node 7. For example, node 6 is connected to 18,24,4,10. Not connected to 7. So node 4 and 7 are not connected. So if node 7 is color 0, node 4 could be 0, but maybe better to use a different color to minimize conflicts. Wait, but if I can color node 4 with 0, since it's not adjacent to node 7. Wait, node 4 is not connected to 7, so they can have the same color. But maybe that's okay. Let's proceed.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to start assigning colors step by step, keeping track of the colors used for adjacent nodes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a backtracking algorithm in my mind, but since this is a manual process, I need to find a valid 3-coloring.\n\nLet me try to list nodes in order and assign colors, checking conflicts.\n\nAlternatively, group nodes into color classes. Let's try.\n\nFirst, node 7: color 0.\n\nAdjacent nodes (32,25,34,0,9,14) can't be 0.\n\nLet's process these adjacent nodes:\n\nNode 32: connected to 7 and 19 (from edge 19-32). So possible colors 1 or 2.\n\nNode 25: connected to 7 and 24. So colors 1 or 2.\n\nNode 34: connected to 7,29,18. Colors 1 or 2.\n\nNode 0: connected to 7,14,11,35. Can't be 0. So colors 1 or 2.\n\nNode 9: connected to 7 and 14. Colors 1 or 2.\n\nNode 14: connected to 7,9,0,18,1. Colors 1 or 2.\n\nNow, let's pick another high-degree node. Maybe node 14. Since it's adjacent to 7 (color 0), it can be 1 or 2. Let's assign color 1 to node 14. Then, nodes connected to 14 (9,0,18,1) can't be 1. So:\n\nNode 9: connected to 7 (0) and 14 (1). So possible color 2.\n\nNode 0: connected to 14 (1) and 7 (0). So possible color 2.\n\nNode 18: connected to 14 (1), 6,4,10,34. So can't be 1.\n\nNode 1: connected to 14 (1). So can't be 1.\n\nSo node 1 can be 0 or 2.\n\nNext, node 0: adjacent to 7 (0) and 14 (1). So possible color 2. Assign color 2 to node 0.\n\nThen, node 0's other neighbors: 11 and 35. They can't be 2. 11 is connected to 0 and 24. 35 is connected to 0.\n\nNow, node 35: connected to 0 (2), so can be 0 or 1.\n\nProceeding. Node 9: connected to 7 (0) and 14 (1). Assign color 2. So node 9 is 2.\n\nNode 32: connected to 7 (0) and 19. Assign color 1. Then, node 19 (connected to 32) can't be 1.\n\nNode 25: connected to 7 (0) and 24. Assign color 1. So node 25 is 1. Then, node 24 is connected to 25 (1) and 6,11. So node 24 can't be 1.\n\nNode 34: connected to 7 (0),29,18. Assign color 1. Then, node 29 and 18 can't be 1.\n\nNow, node 34's color is 1. So node 29 (connected to 34 and 30) can't be 1. Assign color 0 to node 29. Then, node 30 is connected to 29 (0), 23, and 3. So node 30 can't be 0.\n\nNode 18: connected to 14 (1) and 7 (0) is not directly connected. Wait, no. Node 18's edges are 6,4,14,34,10. Node 18 is connected to 14 (color 1) and 34 (color 1). So node 18 cannot be 1. So possible colors 0 or 2. Let's assign color 0 to node 18. But wait, node 18 is connected to node 34 (color 1), so that's okay. Then, check if node 18's other neighbors: 6,4,10,34. 34 is 1, so 18 can be 0. But node 4's color hasn't been assigned yet. Let's check node 4's connections. Node 4 is connected to 6,21,18,17. If node 18 is 0, then node 4 can't be 0 if it's connected to 18. Wait, node 4 and 18 are connected. So node 4's color cannot be the same as node 18's color. If node 18 is 0, then node 4 can't be 0. So if we color node 18 as 0, then node 4 must be 1 or 2. Let's proceed.\n\nSo node 18 is 0. Then, node 4's adjacent nodes: 6,21,18 (0),17. So node 4 can't be 0. Assign color 1 to node 4. Then, node 4's neighbors (6,21,17) can't be 1.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 18 (0),24,4 (1),10. So node 6 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2 to node 6. Then, its neighbors (18,24,4,10) are okay. Node 24 is connected to 6 (2), so can't be 2. Node 24 is already connected to 25 (1) and 11. So possible colors 0 or 2. Wait, but node 24's neighbor 25 is color 1, so node 24 can be 0 or 2, but node 6 is 2, so node 24 can't be 2. Therefore, node 24 must be 0. Assign color 0 to node 24.\n\nNow, node 24 is 0. Its neighbors are 6 (2),25 (1), and 11. So node 11 is connected to 0 (2) and 24 (0). So node 11 can't be 0 or 2. Therefore, node 11 must be 1. Assign color 1 to node 11.\n\nNow, node 11 is 1. So its neighbors (0 and 24) are okay. 0 is 2, 24 is 0. So no conflict.\n\nProceeding. Node 10 is connected to 6 (2) and 17,18 (0). So node 10 can't be 2 or 0. Assign color 1 to node 10. Then, its neighbors (6,17,18) are okay.\n\nNode 17 is connected to 4 (1), 20,10 (1). So node 17 can't be 1. Assign color 0 or 2. Let's pick color 0. Then, node 17 is 0. Its neighbors (4,20,10) are 1, ?, 1. So node 20 is connected to 17 (0) and 22. Assign color 1 or 2.\n\nNode 20: connected to 17 (0) and 22. Assign color 1. Then, node 22 is connected to 20 (1) and 12,2. So node 22 can't be 1. Assign color 0 or 2.\n\nBut node 22's edges: 12-22, 20-22, 2-22. So node 2 is connected to 22. Let's process node 2. Node 2 is connected to 27,22,21. Let's assign color 0 to node 2. Then, node 22 connected to 2 (0) and 20 (1). So node 22 can't be 0 or 1. So must be 2. Assign color 2 to node 22. Then, node 12 is connected to 22 (2), so node 12 can't be 2. Assign color 0 or 1.\n\nBut node 12's only edge is 12-22. So node 12 can be 0 or 1. Let's pick color 0 for node 12.\n\nNow, node 22 is 2. Then, node 2 is 0. Node 21 is connected to 4 (1), 2 (0), and 23. So node 21 can't be 1 or 0. Assign color 2 to node 21. Then, node 23 is connected to 21 (2) and 30. So node 23 can't be 2. Assign color 0 or 1. Let's pick color 0. Node 30 is connected to 23 (0) and 3,29 (0). Wait, node 30's edges are 23-30, 3-30, 29-30. Node 29 is connected to 34 (1) and 30. Node 29 was assigned color 0 earlier. So node 30 is connected to 23 (0), 3 (unknown), 29 (0). So node 30 can't be 0. Assign color 1 or 2. Let's assign color 1 to node 30. Then, node 3's edges are 3-15, 3-30, 3-27. So node 3 is connected to 30 (1), so can't be 1. Assign color 0 or 2.\n\nNode 3: Assign color 0. Then, check neighbors:\n\n- 3-15: node 15's color must not be 0.\n- 3-30: node 30 is 1 (okay).\n- 3-27: node 27's color can't be 0.\n\nNode 27 is connected to 2 (0), 3 (0). So node 27 can't be 0. Assign color 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. Then, node 27 is 1.\n\nNow, node 15 is connected to 3 (0). Assign color 1 or 2. Let's pick 1. So node 15 is 1.\n\nMoving on. Node 23 is 0, node 30 is 1. Node 29 is connected to 34 (1) and 30 (1). Node 29's color is 0 (assigned earlier). That's okay.\n\nNow, node 19 is connected to 32 (1). Assign color 0 or 2. Let's choose 0. So node 19 is 0. Then, its neighbor 32 is 1 (okay).\n\nNode 32 is color 1. Its neighbors are 7 (0) and 19 (0), okay.\n\nNode 25 is color 1. Its neighbors are 7 (0) and 24 (0), okay.\n\nNode 35 is connected to 0 (2). Assign color 0 or 1. Let's pick 0. Then, node 35 is 0.\n\nNow, node 1 is connected to 14 (1). So can't be 1. Assign color 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. Node 1 is 0.\n\nCheck node 1's neighbors: 14 (1) okay.\n\nNode 5: Wait, the nodes are from 0 to 35, so node 5 exists. But I haven't seen any edges involving node 5. So node 5 is isolated. It can be any color. Assign 0.\n\nSimilarly, node 8 is connected to 16. Let's check node 8 and 16.\n\nNode 8 is connected to 16. Let's assign color 0 to node 8, then node 16 can't be 0. Assign color 1. Node 16 is 1.\n\nNode 13: no edges. Assign color 0.\n\nNode 26: no edges mentioned. Assign 0.\n\nNode 28: no edges. Assign 0.\n\nNode 31: no edges. Assign 0.\n\nNode 33: no edges. Assign 0.\n\nWait, let me check all nodes from 0 to 35. The edges list includes nodes up to 35, but nodes 5,8,13,16,26,28,31,33 may be present but not connected. Let me confirm:\n\nOriginal edges list:\n\nCheck for node 5: not mentioned.\n\nNode 8: connected to 16.\n\nNode 16: connected to 8.\n\nNodes 5,13,26,28,31,33: no edges. So they are isolated.\n\nSo for node 5: color 0.\n\nNode 8: connected to 16. Assign color 0. Node 16 is connected to 8 (0), so assign color 1.\n\nNode 13: color 0.\n\nNode 26: color 0.\n\nNode 28: color 0.\n\nNode 31: color 0.\n\nNode 33: color 0.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining nodes.\n\nNode 17's neighbors: 4 (1), 20 (1), 10 (1). Wait, node 17 is 0. Its neighbors 4 (1), 20 (1), 10 (1). So all okay.\n\nNode 20 is 1. Its neighbors are 17 (0) and 22 (2). Okay.\n\nNode 22 is 2. Its neighbors are 20 (1), 12 (0), 2 (0). All okay.\n\nNode 12 is 0. Its neighbor 22 (2) okay.\n\nNode 21 is 2. Its neighbors 4 (1), 2 (0), 23 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 23 is 0. Its neighbor 30 (1), 21 (2). Okay.\n\nNode 30 is 1. Its neighbors 23 (0), 3 (0), 29 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 29 is 0. Its neighbors 34 (1), 30 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 34 is 1. Its neighbors 7 (0), 18 (0), 29 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 18 is 0. Its neighbors 6 (2),4 (1),14 (1),34 (1),10 (1). All okay.\n\nNode 6 is 2. Neighbors 18 (0),24 (0),4 (1),10 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 10 is 1. Neighbors 6 (2),17 (0),18 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 24 is 0.

So, the task is to assign colors to each node using exactly 3 colors, making sure that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. The colors are numbered 0, 1, and 2. The graph has 27 nodes (from 0 to 26) and a list of edges provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the graph by looking at the edges. Let me list out all the edges to see which nodes are connected:\n\n- 6-24\n- 20-23\n- 3-13\n- 0-2\n- 12-22\n- 17-21\n- 8-15\n- 10-24\n- 3-9\n- 2-4\n- 4-23\n- 0-10\n- 2-15\n- 1-5\n- 10-23\n- 9-25\n- 2-19\n- 13-22\n- 11-24\n- 4-13\n- 0-3\n- 8-10\n- 2-9\n- 19-25\n- 16-23\n- 10-25\n- 8-25\n- 1-19\n- 1-22\n\nHmm, that's a lot of edges. Let me try to identify nodes that are highly connected, as they might be tricky to color. For example, node 2 is connected to 0, 4, 15, 19, 9, and maybe others. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the edges involving node 2:\n0-2, 2-4, 2-15, 2-9, 2-19. That's five edges. So node 2 has degree 5. Similarly, node 10 is connected to 24, 23, 25, 0, 8, and maybe others. Let's check:\n\nEdges for node 10: 0-10, 10-24, 10-23, 10-25, 8-10. So five edges as well. So nodes 2 and 10 are high-degree nodes. Similarly, node 23 is connected to 20,4,10,16, maybe others: 20-23,4-23,10-23,16-23. So four edges. Node 25 is connected to 9,19,10,8: 9-25,19-25,10-25,8-25. So four edges. Nodes 24: connected to 6,10,11. Three edges. Node 22: 12,13,1. Three edges. Node 13: 3,4,22. Three edges. Node 19: 2,1,25. Three edges. Node 8: 15,10,25. Three edges. So nodes 2 and 10 have the highest degrees (5 each), followed by 23,25, etc.\n\nSince this graph might have a certain structure, maybe a greedy coloring approach would work. Let me try to assign colors in a way that adjacent nodes have different colors. Start by assigning colors to the highest-degree nodes first, as they have more constraints.\n\nLet's start with node 2. Let's assign color 0. Then, all its neighbors (0,4,15,19,9) can't be color 0. So node 0 can take color 1. Then node 0's neighbors (2,3,10) can't be color 1. Wait, node 0 is connected to 2 (color 0), 3, and 10. So node 0's color is 1.\n\nNext, node 10. It's connected to 0 (color 1), 24,23,25,8. So color 0 is possible for node 10. Wait, node 10 can't be color 1. Let's check: node 0 is color 1, so node 10 can be color 0. Then, node 10's neighbors (0,24,23,25,8) will have to avoid color 0. Let's proceed.\n\nNow node 23: connected to 20,4,10,16. Node 10 is color 0, so 23 can't be 0. Let's assign color 1 to node 23. Then its neighbors 20,4,16, etc., can't be 1.\n\nNode 25 is connected to 9,19,10,8. Node 10 is color 0, so 25 can't be 0. Let's pick color 1. Then nodes 9,19,8 (connected to 25) can't be 1.\n\nNow, node 8 is connected to 15,10 (color 0), and 25 (color 1). So node 8 can be color 2. But wait, 8's neighbors are 15 (unknown), 10 (0), 25 (1). So possible colors for 8 are 2. Assign color 2 to node 8.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 3,2 (color 0), and 25 (color 1). So node 9 can't be 0 or 1. So color 2. Assign color 2 to node 9. Then, node 9's neighbors (3,2,25) must avoid 2.\n\nNode 3 is connected to 0 (color 1), 13, and 9 (color 2). So node 3 can't be 1 or 2. So color 0. Assign color 0 to node 3. Then, node 3's neighbors (0,13,9) can't be 0.\n\nNode 13 is connected to 3 (color 0), 4, and 22. So node 13 can't be 0. Let's assign color 1. Then, node 13's neighbors (3,4,22) can't be 1.\n\nNode 4 is connected to 2 (color 0), 23 (color 1), and 13 (color 1). So node 4 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2. Then neighbors (2,23,13) can't be 2.\n\nNode 19 is connected to 2 (0), 1, and 25 (1). So node 19 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2. Then, neighbors (2,1,25) must avoid 2.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 5,19 (color 2), and 22. So node 1 can't be 2. Let's assign color 0. Then, its neighbors (5,19,22) can't be 0.\n\nNode 22 is connected to 12,13 (color 1), and 1 (color 0). So node 22 can't be 0 or 1. Assign color 2. Then, neighbors (12,13,1) can't be 2.\n\nNode 5 is connected to 1 (color 0). Assign color 1. So node 5 is color 1.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 24. Let's check node 24's color. Node 24 is connected to 6,10 (color 0), 11. Since node 10 is color 0, node 24 can't be 0. Assign color 1 to node 24. Then node 6 can't be 1. Assign color 0 to node 6.\n\nNode 11 is connected to 24 (color 1). Assign color 0 to node 11.\n\nNode 20 is connected to 23 (color 1). Assign color 0 to node 20.\n\nNode 12 is connected to 22 (color 2). Assign color 0 to node 12.\n\nNode 17 is connected to 21. Let's assign color 0 to node 17, then node 21 can be color 1.\n\nNode 15 is connected to 8 (color 2) and 2 (color 0). So node 15 can't be 0 or 2. Assign color 1 to node 15.\n\nNode 16 is connected to 23 (color 1). Assign color 0 to node 16.\n\nNode 14 hasn't been mentioned in any edges. So node 14 is isolated. Assign color 0.\n\nWait, the nodes go up to 26. Let me check all nodes from 0 to 26. Oh wait, the problem states nodes 0 through 26, which is 27 nodes. Let me list all nodes and ensure none are missed.\n\nOriginal nodes listed: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26. So 27 nodes. Let me check if all are accounted for in the edges. Nodes like 7, 14, 18, 21, 26. For example, node 7: not in any edge. So it's an isolated node. Similarly, node 18: not listed in edges. Node 26: not in any edge. So these nodes can be colored any color. Let's assign them color 0.\n\nNow, let me go through each node step by step:\n\nNode 0: color 1 (as earlier)\nNode 1: color 0\nNode 2: color 0\nNode 3: color 0 (Wait, node 3's neighbors are 0 (color 1), 9 (color 2), and 13 (color 1). So node 3 is color 0, correct.\nNode 4: color 2\nNode 5: color 1\nNode 6: color 0\nNode 7: isolated, color 0\nNode 8: color 2\nNode 9: color 2\nNode 10: color 0\nNode 11: color 0\nNode 12: color 0\nNode 13: color 1\nNode 14: isolated, color 0\nNode 15: color 1\nNode 16: color 0\nNode 17: color 0\nNode 18: isolated, color 0\nNode 19: color 2\nNode 20: color 0\nNode 21: color 1 (connected to 17 (0))\nNode 22: color 2\nNode 23: color 1\nNode 24: color 1\nNode 25: color 1\nNode 26: isolated, color 0.\n\nWait, but let's check all assignments for conflicts.\n\nCheck node 0: connected to 2 (color 0), 3 (color 0), and 10 (color 0). Wait, that's a problem! Because if node 0 is color 1, then 2,3,10 can't be 1, but their colors are 0, which is okay. Wait, node 0 is color 1. Its neighbors are 2 (color 0), 3 (color 0), and 10 (color 0). All different from 1. So that's okay.\n\nNode 2: color 0. Its neighbors are 0 (1), 4 (2), 15 (1), 19 (2), 9 (2). All different. Good.\n\nNode 3: color 0. Neighbors 0 (1), 13 (1), 9 (2). All different. Good.\n\nNode 4: color 2. Neighbors 2 (0), 23 (1), 13 (1). Different. Good.\n\nNode 10: color 0. Neighbors 0 (1), 24 (1), 23 (1), 25 (1), 8 (2). Different. Good.\n\nNode 8: color 2. Neighbors 15 (1), 10 (0), 25 (1). All different. Good.\n\nNode 25: color 1. Neighbors 9 (2), 19 (2), 10 (0), 8 (2). All different. Good.\n\nNode 23: color 1. Neighbors 20 (0),4 (2),10 (0),16 (0). Different. Good.\n\nNode 1: color 0. Neighbors 5 (1),19 (2),22 (2). Different.\n\nNode 5: color 1. Neighbor 1 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 19: color 2. Neighbors 2 (0),1 (0),25 (1). Different. Good.\n\nNode 22: color 2. Neighbors 12 (0),13 (1),1 (0). Different.\n\nNode 13: color 1. Neighbors 3 (0),4 (2),22 (2). Different.\n\nNode 15: color 1. Neighbors 8 (2),2 (0). Different.\n\nNode 24: color 1. Neighbors 6 (0),10 (0),11 (0). Different.\n\nNode 6: color 0. Neighbor 24 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 11: color 0. Neighbor 24 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 12: color 0. Neighbor 22 (2). Okay.\n\nNode 17: color 0. Neighbor 21 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 21: color 1. Neighbor 17 (0). Okay.\n\nNode 20: color 0. Neighbor 23 (1). Okay.\n\nNode 16: color 0. Neighbor 23 (1). Okay.\n\nIsolated nodes (7,14,18,26): all assigned 0. No conflicts.\n\nNow, let's check node 25's color. Node 25 is color 1. Its neighbors are 9 (2),19 (2),10 (0),8 (2). All different. Correct.\n\nWhat about node 9: color 2. Its neighbors are 3 (0),2 (0),25 (1). Correct.\n\nNode 8: color 2. Neighbors 15 (1),10 (0),25 (1). Correct.\n\nWhat about node 14? No edges, so color 0. Correct.\n\nNode 7: no edges, color 0. Correct.\n\nNode 18: no edges, color 0. Correct.\n\nNode 26: no edges, color 0. Correct.\n\nOkay, this seems to work. Now, compiling all the nodes with their colors:\n\n0:1,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:2,5:1,6:0,7:0,8:2,9:2,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:1,14:0,15:1,16:0,17:0,18:0,19:2,20:0,21:1,22:2,23:1,24:1,25:1,26:0.\n\nLet me list them all properly in pairs:\n\n[[0,1],[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[4,2],[5,1],[6,0],[7,0],[8,2],[9,2],[10,0],[11,0],[12,0],[13,1],[14,0],[15,1],[16,0],[17,0],[18,0],[19,2],[20,0],[21,1],[22,2],[23,1],[24,1],[25,1],[26,0]]\n\nLet me double-check any possible conflicts. For example, node 3 (color 0) connected to 0 (1), 9 (2), 13 (1). All different. Node 4 (color 2) connected to 2 (0),23 (1),13 (1). Correct. Node 25 (color 1) connected to 9 (2),19 (2),10 (0),8 (2). All different. Node 2 (color 0) connected to 0 (1),4 (2),15 (1),19 (2),9 (2). All okay. Node 10 (color 0) connected to 0 (1),24 (1),23 (1),25 (1),8 (2). All different. Looks good.\n\nNo conflicts found.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the graph based on the edges provided. \n\nFirst, let's list out all the edges again to see the connections:\n\n0 -1, 9-13,5-8,0-13,0-9,3-10,10-13,0-12,11-12,0-2,8-9,4-8,1-6,7-11,5-12,2-8.\n\nSo the nodes are from 0 to 13. Let me try to visualize this. Maybe I can create an adjacency list for each node. \n\nStarting with node 0: connected to 1, 13,9,12,2. That's a lot of connections. So node 0 is adjacent to 1, 2,9,12,13. Then node1 is connected to 0 and 6. Node2 is connected to 0 and 8. Node3 connected to 10. Node4 connected to 8. Node5 connected to 8 and 12. Node6 connected to 1. Node7 connected to 11. Node8 connected to 5,4,9,2. Wait, the edges include 5-8, 8-9, 4-8, 2-8. So node8 is connected to 5,4,9,2. Node9 connected to 0,13,8. Node10 connected to 3,13. Node11 connected to 12 and 7. Node12 connected to 0,11,5. Node13 connected to 0,9,10.\n\nHmm. So the graph has several components. Let me see if there are any obvious cliques. For example, node0 is connected to multiple nodes. So node0's color will affect many others. Let's start by assigning colors step by step.\n\nWe need to use exactly 3 colors. Let's pick color 0 for node0. Then its adjacent nodes (1,2,9,12,13) can't be color0. Then, for node1, which is adjacent to 0, it can take color1. Then node1's other neighbor is node6. Node6 only connected to node1, so node6 can take color0 or 2, but let's see later.\n\nLooking at node2, adjacent to 0 (color0), so it can't be 0. Let's assign color1 to node2. Then node2's other neighbor is node8. Node8 is connected to node2 (color1), so node8 can't be 1. Also, node8 is connected to 5,4,9. Let's think about node8's color. Let's pick color0. Wait, but node8 is connected to node2 (color1), so color0 is allowed. Then node8's color can be 0. Then nodes connected to 8 (5,4,9,2) must have different colors. So node5,4,9 can't be 0. But node5 is connected to 8 (color0) and 12. Node5's color must be different from 0 and whatever 12 is. Wait, node12 is connected to 0 (color0), 11, and 5. So node12 can't be 0. Let's handle node12. Since node12 is connected to 0 (color0), 11, and 5. Let's assign node12 color1. Then node5, connected to 12 (color1) and 8 (color0). So node5 can take color2. Then node5's color is 2.\n\nNow, node4 connected to 8 (color0). So node4 can't be 0. Assign color1 to node4. Node9 connected to 0 (color0), 13, and 8 (color0). So node9 can't be 0. Assign color1. Then node13 connected to 0 (color0),9 (color1), and 10. So node13 can't be 0 or1. Assign color2 to node13. Then node10 connected to 3 and 13 (color2). So node10 can't be 2. Assign color0. Then node3 connected to 10 (color0), so node3 can't be 0. Assign color1. \n\nNow, node11 is connected to 12 (color1) and 7. Node12 is color1, so node11 can't be 1. Assign color0. Then node7 is connected to 11 (color0), so node7 can't be 0. Assign color1. \n\nNode6 is connected to 1 (color1), so it can't be 1. Assign color0.\n\nLet's check if this works. Let's go through each node:\n\n0: color0. Adjacent to 1 (color1), 2 (color1),9 (color1),12 (color1),13 (color2). All different from 0. Good.\n\n1: color1. Adjacent to 0 (color0),6 (color0). Different. Good.\n\n2: color1. Adjacent to 0 (color0),8 (color0). Different. Good.\n\n3: color1. Adjacent to10 (color0). Different. Good.\n\n4: color1. Adjacent to8 (color0). Different. Good.\n\n5: color2. Adjacent to8 (color0),12 (color1). Different. Good.\n\n6: color0. Adjacent to1 (color1). Good.\n\n7: color1. Adjacent to11 (color0). Good.\n\n8: color0. Adjacent to2 (color1),5 (color2),4 (color1),9 (color1). All different. Wait, 9 is color1 and 8 is color0. So that's okay. Yes.\n\n9: color1. Adjacent to0 (color0),13 (color2),8 (color0). All different. Good.\n\n10: color0. Adjacent to3 (color1),13 (color2). Different. Good.\n\n11: color0. Adjacent to12 (color1),7 (color1). Different. Good.\n\n12: color1. Adjacent to0 (color0),11 (color0),5 (color2). All different. Good.\n\n13: color2. Adjacent to0 (color0),9 (color1),10 (color0). All different. Good.\n\nSo all nodes are colored without conflicts. Let me check each edge again to ensure no two adjacent nodes have the same color.\n\nEdge 0-1: 0 vs 1 (0 vs1) okay.\n\n0-13: 0 vs 2 okay.\n\n0-9:0 vs1 okay.\n\n0-12:0 vs1 okay.\n\n0-2:0 vs1 okay.\n\n1-6:1 vs0 okay.\n\n2-8:2 (color1) vs8 (color0) okay.\n\n3-10:3 (color1) vs10 (0) okay.\n\n4-8:4 (1) vs8 (0) okay.\n\n5-8:5 (2) vs8 (0) okay.\n\n5-12:5 (2) vs12 (1) okay.\n\n7-11:7 (1) vs11 (0) okay.\n\n8-9:8 (0) vs9 (1) okay.\n\n9-13:9 (1) vs13 (2) okay.\n\n10-13:10 (0) vs13 (2) okay.\n\n11-12:11 (0) vs12 (1) okay.\n\nI think that's all edges covered. Looks like all are valid. So the coloring uses three colors (0,1,2). Each node is assigned a color, no two adjacent nodes share the same color. So this should be a valid 3-coloring.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0,0],[1,1],[2,1],[3,1],[4,1],[5,2],[6,0],[7,1],[8,0],[9,1],[10,0],[11,0],[12,1],[13,2]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

Let's start by understanding the structure of the graph. The nodes are from 0 to 31, and there are a bunch of edges provided. The goal is to assign each node a color from 0, 1, or 2 such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the edges to see the connections. Let me parse the edges:\n\n0 -30, 14-16, 22-23, 5-10, 22-26, 1-6, 8-21, 2-26, 6-14, 16-22, 7-13, 6-23, 12-21, 4-17, 14-15, 22-28, 9-16, 0-16, 0-28, 24-25, 16-21, 16-24, 24-31, 7-30, 20-27, 19-25, 27-29, 2-30, 13-21, 15-18, 2-15.\n\nHmm. Let's see which nodes are connected and might form cliques or have high degrees. Nodes like 16, for example, are connected to multiple nodes. Let me check node 16's connections. From the edges: 14-16, 0-16, 9-16, 16-22, 16-21, 16-24. So node 16 is connected to 14, 0,9,22,21,24. That's six neighbors. So node 16 needs a color different from all those six. Since we have three colors, we can assign colors in a way that these neighbors don't all use the same colors.\n\nSimilarly, node 2 is connected to 26, 30, 15. Node 22 is connected to 23,26,16,28. Node 24 is connected to 16,25,31. \n\nMaybe a good approach is to start with the highest degree nodes and assign colors first, then work through their neighbors. Let's see:\n\nNode 16 has degree 6. Let's assign it color 0. Then its neighbors (14,0,9,22,21,24) can't be 0. Let's pick color 1 for some of them, but need to make sure they don't conflict with each other.\n\nBut wait, maybe a better way is to use a graph coloring algorithm like backtracking, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can group the nodes into color classes such that no two in the same class are adjacent.\n\nLet me try to proceed step by step.\n\nStart with node 0. Let's assign color 0. Then, its neighbors are 30,16,28. So those three can't be 0.\n\nBut wait, node 0 is connected to 30 and 16 and 28. So 30,16,28 must be different from 0's color.\n\nWait, but node 0 is connected to 30, 16, and 28. So those three nodes (30,16,28) can't have the same color as node 0.\n\nLet me pick node 0: color 0. Then 30,16,28 must be 1 or 2.\n\nLet's assign node 16 to color 1. Now, node 16 is connected to 14,0 (color 0),9,22,21,24. So node 16 is color 1. Then neighbors can't be 1. So 14,9,22,21,24 must be 0,2.\n\nWait, but node 0 is color 0, and 16 is color 1.\n\nLet me assign node 14. It's connected to 16 (color1), so 14 can be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0. But then node 14 is connected to 6 and 15. So node 6 is connected to 14 (if 14 is 0, then node 6 can't be 0. But wait, node 6's edges are 1-6,6-14,6-23.\n\nSo if node 14 is 0, then node 6 can't be 0. Let's say node 6 is 1. Then node 1, which is connected to 6, must not be 1. So node 1 can be 0 or 2.\n\nBut this could get complicated. Maybe using a systematic approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a 3-coloring by considering cycles. If the graph is bipartite, two colors would suffice, but since it's requiring three, there must be an odd cycle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a greedy algorithm, assigning the lowest possible color to each node in some order.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet me try to build the color assignments step by step.\n\nStart with node 0: color 0.\n\nThen, nodes 30, 16, 28 are connected to 0. Assign them colors 1 and 2. Let's pick 1 for 30. Then 30's neighbors are 0 (color0), 7 (since edge 7-30), and 2 (edge 2-30). So node 30 is color1. Then nodes 7 and 2 can't be 1.\n\nAssign node 30: color1. Now, nodes 7 and 2 must be different from 1.\n\nThen node 16 (connected to 0) must be color 1 or 2. Let's assign 16: color1. Now, neighbors of 16 (14,9,22,21,24,0). Wait, 0 is already color0, and 16 is color1. So 14,9,22,21,24 must be colors 0 or 2.\n\nBut 14 is connected to 16 (color1) and also to 6 and 15. Let's assign 14: color0. Then 14's neighbors 6 and 15 can't be 0.\n\nSo node 6 is connected to 1,14,23. 14 is color0, so node 6 can't be 0. Assign color1. Then node 1 (connected to 6) can't be 1. So node 1 could be 0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nSo:\n\n0:0\n\n30:1\n\n16:1\n\n14:0\n\n6:1\n\n1:0\n\nThen, node 6 is color1. Its neighbors are 1 (0),14 (0),23. So node 23 can't be 1. Assign node 23: let's see, node 23 is connected to 6 (1) and 22. Assign node 23 to 0 or 2. Let's pick 2.\n\nThen, node 22 is connected to 16 (color1) and 23 (color2). So node 22 can't be 1 or 2. Wait, but we only have colors 0,1,2. So if node22 is connected to 1 and 2, then the only possible color is 0.\n\nSo assign node22:0.\n\nThen node22's other edges: 22-26, 22-28, 16-22 (already handled). Node 26 is connected to 22 (0) and 2 (since edge 2-26). Node 2 is connected to 26 and 30 (color1), and 15 (from edge 2-15).\n\nSo node 2's neighbors are 30 (color1), 26 (which we need to determine), and 15. Let's assign node2. Since node2 is connected to 30 (1), it can't be 1. So possible colors 0 or 2. Let's assign 2:0.\n\nThen node 26, connected to 22 (0) and 2 (0). So node26 can't be 0. Assign color1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nSo node26:1.\n\nNow, node2 is color0. Its neighbor 15 (from edge2-15) can't be 0. So node15 can be 1 or 2.\n\nNode15 is connected to 14 (color0) and 2 (color0) and 18. Assign node15:1.\n\nNow, node15 is color1. Then node18 (connected to 15) can't be 1.\n\nSo node18:0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nContinuing with node16's neighbors: 9,21,24.\n\nNode9 is connected to 16 (color1). Assign color0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nNode9:0.\n\nNode21 is connected to 16 (color1), 8 (edge8-21),12 (edge12-21), and 13 (edge13-21). Assign color0 or 2. Let's pick 0.\n\nBut wait, node21's neighbors are 16 (1), 8,12,13. Let's assign 21:0. Then nodes 8,12,13 must not be 0.\n\nNode8 is connected to 21 (0), so node8 can be 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode12 is connected to 21 (0), so can be 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode13 is connected to 21 (0) and 7 (edge7-13). Node7 is connected to 13 and 30 (color1). Assign node7:0 (since 30 is 1 and 7's neighbor 13 can be handled later).\n\nWait, node7 is connected to 30 (color1) and 13. So node7 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Let's assign 0.\n\nThen node13, connected to 7 (0) and 21 (0). So node13 can't be 0. Assign 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nNow, node13:1. So node21 is 0, which is okay.\n\nBack to node16's neighbor 24. Node24 is connected to 16 (1), 25 (edge24-25), and 31 (edge24-31). Assign color0 or 2. Let's pick 2.\n\nSo node24:2.\n\nThen node25 is connected to 24 (2) and 19 (edge19-25). So node25 can't be 2. Assign 0 or 1. Let's assign 0.\n\nNode19 is connected to 25 (0). Assign 1 or 2. Let's say 1.\n\nNode24's other neighbor is 31. So node31 can't be 2. Assign 0 or 1. Let's pick 0.\n\nNow, node24:2, node31:0.\n\nNow, node28 is connected to 0 (color0) and 22 (color0). So node28 can't be 0. Assign 1 or 2. Let's pick 1.\n\nSo node28:1.\n\nThen node22 is 0, which is connected to 28:1 (okay).\n\nNext, node5 is connected to 10. Let's assign node5:0. Then node10 can be 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nSo node5:0, node10:1.\n\nNode4 is connected to 17. Assign node4:0. Node17 can be 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode20 is connected to 27. Assign node20:0. Node27 can be 1 or 2. Assign 1.\n\nNode27 is connected to 29 (edge27-29). Assign node27:1. Then node29 can't be 1. Assign 0 or 2. Assign 0.\n\nNode27:1, node29:0.\n\nNode3: haven't been mentioned in edges. Wait, are there nodes not present in the edge list? Let me check. The nodes are from 0 to31. But in the edges provided, some nodes might not be connected. For example, nodes 3, 11, 17 (wait, node17 is connected to 4), node18 is connected to15, etc.\n\nWait, the list of edges given: let me check again.\n\nEdges list:\n\n0 -30,\n\n14-16,\n\n22-23,\n\n5-10,\n\n22-26,\n\n1-6,\n\n8-21,\n\n2-26,\n\n6-14,\n\n16-22,\n\n7-13,\n\n6-23,\n\n12-21,\n\n4-17,\n\n14-15,\n\n22-28,\n\n9-16,\n\n0-16,\n\n0-28,\n\n24-25,\n\n16-21,\n\n16-24,\n\n24-31,\n\n7-30,\n\n20-27,\n\n19-25,\n\n27-29,\n\n2-30,\n\n13-21,\n\n15-18,\n\n2-15.\n\nSo nodes not in the edges list as connected: 3, 11, 17 (connected to 4), 18 (connected to 15), 19 (connected to 25), 20 (connected to27), 21 is connected, 23, 24, 25, etc. Wait, nodes like 3, 11, and perhaps others. So node3 is not connected to any edges. So node3 can be colored any color. Similarly, node11 is not connected to any edges, so it can be any color.\n\nSo for nodes not connected to anyone, assign them any color. Let's pick 0 for simplicity.\n\nSo node3:0.\n\nNode11:0.\n\nNode17: connected to 4. Node4 is color0 (assigned earlier), so node17 can be 1 or 2. We assigned node17:1.\n\nNode18: connected to15 (color1). So node18 can be 0 or 2. We assigned 0 earlier.\n\nNode19: connected to25 (color0). So node19:1 or 2. Assigned 1.\n\nNode20: connected to27 (color1). So node20:0.\n\nNode23: color2 (assigned earlier).\n\nNode25:0.\n\nNode26:1.\n\nNode27:1.\n\nNode28:1.\n\nNode29:0.\n\nNode31:0.\n\nNow, let's check node8: we assigned color1. Node8 is connected to21 (color0). So okay.\n\nNode12: color1. Connected to21 (0). Okay.\n\nNode7: color0. Connected to30 (1) and13 (1). Okay.\n\nNode13: color1. Connected to7 (0) and21 (0). Okay.\n\nNode9:0. Connected to16 (1). Okay.\n\nNode24:2. Connected to16 (1),25 (0),31 (0). So okay.\n\nNode25:0. Connected to24 (2),19 (1). Okay.\n\nNode19:1. Connected to25 (0). Okay.\n\nNode31:0. Connected to24 (2). Okay.\n\nNow, node2: color0. Connected to30 (1),26 (1),15 (1). So all adjacent have different colors. Okay.\n\nNode26:1. Connected to2 (0) and22 (0). Okay.\n\nNode15:1. Connected to14 (0),2 (0), and18 (0). Okay.\n\nNode18:0. Connected to15 (1). Okay.\n\nNode10:1. Connected to5 (0). Okay.\n\nNode5:0. Connected to10 (1). Okay.\n\nNode4:0. Connected to17 (1). Okay.\n\nNode17:1. Connected to4 (0). Okay.\n\nNode3:0. No connections.\n\nNode11:0. No connections.\n\nNode20:0. Connected to27 (1). Okay.\n\nNode27:1. Connected to20 (0),29 (0). Okay.\n\nNode29:0. Connected to27 (1). Okay.\n\nNode3 and 11 are isolated, so color0 is fine.\n\nNow, let's check node22: color0. Connected to23 (2),16 (1),26 (1),28 (1). Okay.\n\nNode23:2. Connected to6 (1),22 (0). Okay.\n\nNode6:1. Connected to1 (0),14 (0),23 (2). Okay.\n\nNode1:0. Connected to6 (1). Okay.\n\nNode0:0. Connected to30 (1),16 (1),28 (1). Okay.\n\nNow, check node7: color0. Connected to30 (1),13 (1). Okay.\n\nNode30:1. Connected to0 (0),7 (0),2 (0). Okay.\n\nNode28:1. Connected to0 (0),22 (0). Okay.\n\nNow, the remaining nodes: node3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,17,19,20,24,25,27,29,31 are all colored. Let me check for any missed nodes.\n\nNodes:0-31.

But node18 is connected to15 (1), so that's okay.\n\nNode23:2. Connected to6 (1) and22 (0). So okay.\n\nWhat about node28:1. Connected to0 (0) and22 (0). Okay.\n\nNow, let's check all edges to ensure no conflicts.\n\nCheck edge 0-30: 0 (0) and 30 (1). Good.\n\n14-16:14 (0) and16 (1). Good.\n\n22-23:22 (0) and23 (2). Good.\n\n5-10:5 (0) and10 (1).

Wait, let's verify all 32 nodes are included.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNodes 0-31:\n\n0:0\n\n1:0\n\n2:0\n\n3:0\n\n4:0\n\n5:0\n\n6:1\n\n7:0\n\n8:1\n\n9:0\n\n10:1\n\n11:0\n\n12:1\n\n13:1\n\n14:0\n\n15:1\n\n16:1\n\n17:1\n\n18:0\n\n19:1\n\n20:0\n\n21:0\n\n22:0\n\n23:2\n\n24:2\n\n25:0\n\n26:1\n\n27:1\n\n28:1\n\n29:0\n\n30:1\n\n31:0\n\nYes, all 32 nodes are colored. Now, the colors used are 0,1, and 2. Let's check if any color is not used. For example, color2 is used in nodes23 and24. So yes, all three colors are used.\n\nWait, but the problem says to use exactly 3 colors. So that's okay as long as all three are used. In our case, colors 0,1,2 are used. So this is valid.\n\nNow, the output should be a list of pairs for each node in order. Let me list them in order from node0 to node31.\n\n[[0,0], [1,0], [2,0], [3,0], [4,0], [5,0], [6,1], [7,0], [8,1], [9,0], [10,1], [11,0], [12,1], [13,1], [14,0], [15,1], [16,1], [17,1], [18,0], [19,1], [20,0], [21,0], [22,0], [23,2], [24,2], [25,0], [26,1], [27,1], [28,1], [29,0], [30,1], [31,0]]\n\nWait, but node1 is 0, node2 is0. Are there adjacent nodes with same color? Let me check again. For example, nodes 0 and 1 are connected? Wait, node1's edges are 1-6. So node1 is connected to node6. Node1 is color0, node6 is color1. That's okay.\n\nNode2 is color0. Its edges are 2-26, 2-30,2-15. All those nodes are 1 (node26,30,15), so no conflict.\n\nNode3 is color0, but it's not connected to anyone. So okay.\n\nNode4 is color0, connected to 17 (1). Good.\n\nNode5 is 0, connected to10 (1). Good.\n\nNode7 is 0, connected to30 (1) and13 (1). Good.\n\nNode8 is1, connected to21 (0). Good.\n\nNode9 is0, connected to16 (1). Good.\n\nNode11 is0, no connections.\n\nNode12 is1, connected to21 (0). Good.\n\nNode14 is0, connected to16 (1),6 (1),15 (1). Good.\n\nNode16 is1, connected to many as discussed.\n\nNode17 is1, connected to4 (0). Good.\n\nNode18 is0, connected to15 (1). Good.\n\nNode19 is1, connected to25 (0). Good.\n\nNode20 is0, connected to27 (1). Good.\n\nNode21 is0, connected to16 (1),8 (1),12 (1),13 (1). All different colors.\n\nNode22 is0, connected to16 (1),23 (2), etc. Good.\n\nNode23 is2, connected to6 (1),22 (0). Good.\n\nNode24 is2, connected to16 (1),25 (0),31 (0). Good.\n\nNode25 is0, connected to24 (2),19 (1). Good.\n\nNode26 is1, connected to2 (0),22 (0). Good.\n\nNode27 is1, connected to20 (0),29 (0). Good.\n\nNode28 is1, connected to0 (0),22 (0). Good.\n\nNode29 is0, connected to27 (1). Good.\n\nNode30 is1, connected to0 (0),7 (0),2 (0). Good.\n\nNode31 is0, connected to24 (2). Good.\n\nSo all edges are satisfied, and exactly three colors are used. This should be a valid coloring.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[4,0],[5,0],[6,1],[7,0],[8,1],[9,0],[10,1],[11,0],[12,1],[13,1],[14,0],[15,1],[16,1],[17,1],[18,0],[19,1],[20,0],[21,0],[22,0],[23,2],[24,2],[25,0],[26,1],[27,1],[28,1],[29,0],[30,1],[31,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.

Let's see... First, I'll start by understanding the structure of the graph. There are 45 nodes (from 0 to 44) connected by the edges provided. My goal is to assign each node a color (0, 1, or 2) such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.\n\nHmm, maybe I should start by listing out all the edges and see if there's any pattern or nodes with high degrees. Nodes with more edges are harder to color, so tackling them first might help.\n\nLooking at the edges, let's note which nodes are connected. Let's try to create an adjacency list. But that might take time. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for nodes that are connected to many others. Let me scan through the edges:\n\n0 is connected to 36, 7, 37. So degree 3.\n9 is connected to 42, 14, 16, 30. Degree 4.\n6 is connected to 21,23,31. Degree 3.\n25 connected to 38,30. Degree 2.\n18 connected to 35,37,40,36. Degree 4.\n20 connected to 26,27. Degree 2.\n16 connected to 41,9. Degree 2.\n... Hmm, maybe 9 and 18 have higher degrees. Let's check others.\n\nWait, node 27 is connected to 4,10,23,20,38,41. That's a lot. Let's see: 4-27, 10-27, 23-27, 20-27, 27-38, 27-41. So node 27 has degree 6. That's a high degree node. Definitely need to handle that one carefully.\n\nSimilarly, node 8 is connected to 4, 35, 10, 22. So edges 4-8, 8-35, 8-10, 8-22. Degree 4.\n\nNode 12 is connected to 23, 32, 11. Degree 3.\n\nNode 31 connected to 44,43,6. Degree 3.\n\nNode 32 connected to 13,35,12. Degree 3.\n\nNode 35 connected to 18, 32, 8. Also 32-35 is an edge. And 8-35. So 35's edges: 18-35, 32-35, 8-35. So degree 3.\n\nNode 36 connected to 0, 18, 29. So edges 0-36,18-36,29-36. Degree 3.\n\nNode 42 connected to 9,34. So 9-42, 34-42. Degree 2.\n\nNode 43 connected to 40,31. 40-43 and 31-43. Degree 2.\n\nSo, the highest degree node here is 27 with 6 edges. Let's start by assigning color 0 to node 27. Then, all its neighbors must not be 0. The neighbors are 4,10,23,20,38,41.\n\nSo let's assign colors 1 or 2 to these. Let's pick color 1 for 4. Then 10 can be 1 as well, but wait, are they connected? Let's check if 4 is connected to 10. The edges list includes 4-27, 10-27, but 4 and 10 are connected via 8. Wait, looking at the edges, there's 8-10. So 8 is connected to 10 and 4. So 4 and 10 are both connected to 8. But 4 and 10 themselves, are they connected? Let me check the edges again. The edges include 4-8, 8-10, but no direct 4-10. So 4 and 10 are not directly connected. So if 4 is color 1, 10 can be color 1 as well. But 8 is connected to both, so 8's color must differ from both. Hmm.\n\nBut first, back to node 27's neighbors. Assign 4 to color 1, 10 to color 1 (if possible), 23 to color 2, 20 to color 1, 38 to color 2, 41 to color 1. Wait, but let's check if any of these neighbors are connected. For example, 4 and 8 are connected (edge 4-8). So if 4 is color 1, 8 can't be 1. Then 8's neighbors: 4,35,10,22. Let's assign 8 a color 0. Then 4 is 1, 8 is 0. 10 is connected to 8 (so cannot be 0). If 10 is color 1, that's okay. Then 10 is connected to 27 (color 0) and 8 (color 0). So 10 can be 1. But 10 is also connected to 8 and 27, so 1 is okay.\n\nBut wait, node 10 is connected to 8 (color 0) and 27 (color 0). So color 1 is allowed. Similarly, node 4 is connected to 8 (0) and 27 (0). So 4 is 1. Now, node 8's other neighbors: 35 and 22. 35's color can't be 0. So when we get to 35, assign it a different color.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step. Let's start by coloring node 27 as 0.\n\nThen, neighbors of 27 (nodes 4,10,23,20,38,41) can't be 0.\n\nLet's assign:\n\n4: 1\n\n10: 2\n\n23: 1\n\n20: 2\n\n38: 1\n\n41: 2\n\nBut wait, need to check if any of these are connected. Let's check edges between these nodes.\n\nLooking at edges:\n\n- 4-8. 4 is connected to 8, which isn't in this list.\n\n- 10 is connected to 8 and 27. So 10 is in the list. 10 and 8, but 8's color is to be determined.\n\n- 23 is connected to 6, 27, and 12. 6's color is not yet assigned. 12 is connected to 23. So if 23 is 1, then 12 can't be 1.\n\n- 20 is connected to 26 and 27. So 26 is not in the neighbors list. 20's color is 2, so 26 can be any except 2.\n\n- 38 is connected to 25 and 27. 25's color is to be determined.\n\n- 41 is connected to 16,14,27. 14 is connected to 41. So when we assign 41 as 2, then 14 must not be 2.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is getting complicated. Maybe a better way is to process nodes in order, starting with the highest degree and then their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, let's model this as a graph and try to assign colors step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using backtracking would be the way, but since this is a thought process, maybe a greedy approach is feasible.\n\nAnother approach: since the graph is connected and needs 3 colors, perhaps the graph is 3-colorable, so we can proceed by choosing a node, assign a color, then assign colors to adjacent nodes, ensuring no conflicts.\n\nBut to do this step by step:\n\n1. Start with node 27 (highest degree). Assign color 0.\n\n2. Assign colors to its neighbors (4,10,23,20,38,41). None can be 0.\n\nLet's pick 4: color 1.\n\n10: color 2.\n\n23: color 1.\n\n20: color 2.\n\n38: color 1.\n\n41: color 2.\n\nBut need to check if any of these neighbors are connected. For example, 4 and 10: are they connected? Looking at the edges, no. So their colors can be same or different. But if 4 is 1 and 10 is 2, that's okay.\n\nNow, move to the next nodes.\n\n3. Let's look at node 8. It's connected to 4 (color 1), 35, 10 (color 2), and 22. So node 8 can't be 1 or 2. So must be color 0.\n\n4. Node 8's neighbors: 4 (1), 35 (unknown), 10 (2), 22 (unknown). So 8 is 0. Now, 35 can't be 0.\n\nNode 35's edges: connected to 18, 32, 8 (0). So when we color 35, it can't be 0. Let's assign 35 to color 1.\n\nBut also, 35 is connected to 32 (we'll get to that).\n\n5. Node 35: color 1.\n\n6. Now, node 18 is connected to 35 (1), 37, 40, 36. So 18 can't be 1. Assign 18 color 0.\n\n7. Node 18's neighbors: 35 (1), 37, 40, 36. So 37, 40, 36 can't be 0.\n\nLet's handle node 36, which is connected to 0, 18 (0), and 29. Since 18 is 0, 36 can't be 0. So node 36's possible colors: 1 or 2.\n\nBut node 0 is connected to 36, so whatever color 0 has, 36 must differ.\n\nWait, node 0 hasn't been colored yet. Let's backtrack.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should process nodes in order. Let's list the nodes and their edges again, maybe that's better.\n\nAlternatively, proceed step by step, but this could take a while. Let's try to proceed in order.\n\nStarting with node 27 (color 0), neighbors colored.\n\nNow, node 4 (color 1) is connected to 8 and 27. Node 8 is color 0 (from step 3).\n\nNode 8's neighbors: 4 (1), 35 (color 1?), 10 (2), 22. Wait, 35 is connected to 8 (0). So 35 can't be 0. Let's assign 35 to color 1. Then, node 32 is connected to 35 (1) and 13, 12. So 32 can't be 1. Assign 32 color 0.\n\nBut node 32 is connected to 12, 35 (1), 13. So 32's color 0. Then 12 can't be 0. Node 12 is connected to 23 (color 1), 32 (0), 11. So 12's possible colors are 2 or 1. But since 23 is 1, 12 can be 2.\n\nAssign 12: color 2.\n\nNow, node 12's neighbors: 23 (1), 32 (0), 11. So 11 can be 0 or 1.\n\nProceeding to node 23, which is color 1 (from step 2). Its neighbors: 6, 27 (0), 12 (2). So node 6 can't be 1. Assign 6 color 0 or 2.\n\nBut node 6 is connected to 21 and 31. Let's check. Assign 6 color 2. Then, 21 and 31 can't be 2.\n\nNode 21 is connected to 6 (2), 30, 44. Assign 21 color 0 or 1. Let's choose 0.\n\nThen, node 30 is connected to 21 (0) and 25. Node 25 is connected to 38 (color 1) and 30. Assign 25 color 2.\n\nNode 30 can't be 0 (if 21 is 0). Assign 30 color 1. Then, node 25 (color 2) is connected to 30 (1), which is okay.\n\nNode 9 is connected to 42, 14, 16, 30 (1). So node 9 can't be 1. Assign color 0 or 2. Let's check 9's other connections. 9 is connected to 30 (1), 42, 14, 16. So assign 9 color 0. Then, 42 can't be 0. 14 can't be 0. 16 can't be 0.\n\nNode 42 connected to 9 (0) and 34. Assign 42 color 1. Then 34 can't be 1. Node 34 is connected to 42 (1) and 19. Assign 34 color 0. Then 19 can be any color except 0.\n\nThis is getting quite involved. Let's try to track colors as we go:\n\nColors assigned so far:\n\n27: 0\n\n4:1\n\n10:2\n\n23:1\n\n20:2\n\n38:1\n\n41:2\n\n8:0\n\n35:1\n\n18:0\n\n36: ?\n\nWait, node 0 hasn't been colored yet. Node 0 is connected to 36,7,37.\n\nWait, node 0's edges: 0-36, 0-7, 0-37.\n\nSo when coloring node 0, need to avoid colors of 36,7,37. But those nodes might not be colored yet.\n\nThis approach might lead to conflicts, so perhaps a better way is to use a graph coloring algorithm that checks all constraints. But since this is a manual process, let's try to proceed systematically.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\n1. Create a list of all nodes.\n\n2. Order the nodes by descending degree to prioritize coloring high-degree nodes first.\n\n3. For each node in order, assign the smallest possible color that doesn't conflict with already colored neighbors.\n\nThis is the greedy algorithm approach.\n\nLet's list the degrees of each node:\n\nCount how many edges each node has.\n\nLooking at the edges list:\n\nEdges are:\n\n0 - 36\n\n9 - 42\n\n6 - 21\n\n25 - 38\n\n18 - 35\n\n20 - 26\n\n16 - 41\n\n9 - 14\n\n31 - 44\n\n4 - 27\n\n10 - 27\n\n15 - 17\n\n6 - 23\n\n13 - 32\n\n4 - 8\n\n18 - 37\n\n21 - 30\n\n18 - 40\n\n23 - 27\n\n0 - 7\n\n40 - 43\n\n9 - 16\n\n31 - 43\n\n34 - 42\n\n8 - 35\n\n1 - 17\n\n32 - 35\n\n0 - 37\n\n25 - 30\n\n6 - 31\n\n12 - 23\n\n18 - 36\n\n20 - 27\n\n29 - 36\n\n8 - 10\n\n12 - 32\n\n11 - 12\n\n1 - 13\n\n21 - 44\n\n8 - 22\n\n3 - 44\n\n14 - 41\n\n27 - 38\n\n9 - 30\n\n19 - 34\n\n27 - 41\n\nSo, let's count each node's degree:\n\nNode 0: edges with 36,7,37 → degree 3.\n\nNode 1: edges with 17,13 → degree 2.\n\nNode 3: edge with 44 → degree 1.\n\nNode 4: edges with 27,8 → degree 2.\n\nNode 6: edges with 21,23,31 → degree 3.\n\nNode 7: edge with 0 → degree 1.\n\nNode 8: edges with 4,35,10,22 → degree 4.\n\nNode 9: edges with 42,14,16,30 → degree 4.\n\nNode 10: edges with 27,8 → degree 2.\n\nNode 11: edge with 12 → degree 1.\n\nNode 12: edges with 23,32,11 → degree 3.\n\nNode 13: edges with 32,1 → degree 2.\n\nNode 14: edges with 9,41 → degree 2.\n\nNode 15: edge with 17 → degree 1.\n\nNode 16: edges with 41,9 → degree 2.\n\nNode 17: edges with 15,1 → degree 2.\n\nNode 18: edges with 35,37,40,36 → degree 4.\n\nNode 19: edge with 34 → degree 1.\n\nNode 20: edges with 26,27 → degree 2.\n\nNode 21: edges with 6,30,44 → degree 3.\n\nNode 22: edge with 8 → degree 1.\n\nNode 23: edges with 6,27,12 → degree 3.\n\nNode 25: edges with 38,30 → degree 2.\n\nNode 26: edge with 20 → degree 1.\n\nNode 27: edges with 4,10,23,20,38,41 → degree 6.\n\nNode 29: edge with 36 → degree 1.\n\nNode 30: edges with 21,25,9 → degree 3.\n\nNode 31: edges with 44,43,6 → degree 3.\n\nNode 32: edges with 13,35,12 → degree 3.\n\nNode 34: edges with 42,19 → degree 2.\n\nNode 35: edges with 18,8,32 → degree 3.\n\nNode 36: edges with 0,18,29 → degree 3.\n\nNode 37: edges with 18,0 → degree 2.\n\nNode 38: edges with 25,27 → degree 2.\n\nNode 40: edges with 18,43 → degree 2.\n\nNode 41: edges with 16,27,14 → degree 3.\n\nNode 42: edges with 9,34 → degree 2.\n\nNode 43: edges with 40,31 → degree 2.\n\nNode 44: edges with 31,21,3 → degree 3.\n\nSo nodes with highest degree:\n\nNode 27: 6\n\nNodes 8,9,18: degree 4.\n\nNodes 0,6,12,21,23,30,31,32,35,36,41,44: degree 3.\n\nThe rest have lower degrees.\n\nSo order for coloring (descending degree):\n\n27 (6), 8 (4),9 (4),18 (4), then the degree 3 nodes, then others.\n\nLet's proceed with this order.\n\n1. Node 27: assign color 0.\n\nNeighbors: 4,10,23,20,38,41.\n\n2. Node 8: degree 4. Edges to 4,35,10,22.\n\nCurrently, 4 and 10 are neighbors of 27 (color 0) but not yet colored. Wait, no, node 27 is colored first. Let's proceed step by step:\n\nAt each step, when coloring a node, check already colored neighbors and assign the smallest possible color not used by them.\n\nLet's list the order again:\n\n1. 27 (6)\n2. 8 (4)\n3. 9 (4)\n4. 18 (4)\n5. 0 (3)\n6. 6 (3)\n7. 12 (3)\n8. 21 (3)\n9. 23 (3)\n10. 30 (3)\n11. 31 (3)\n12. 32 (3)\n13. 35 (3)\n14. 36 (3)\n15. 41 (3)\n16. 44 (3)\nThen others.\n\nBut when we color nodes in this order, each time we color a node, we look at its already colored neighbors and choose the lowest possible color that doesn't conflict.\n\nLet's try this:\n\n1. Node 27: color 0.\n\n2. Node 8: neighbors are 4,35,10,22. None are colored yet except perhaps 4 and 10 if they were processed. Wait, node 4 and 10 are neighbors of 27 but in the order, node 8 is next. So when coloring node 8, none of its neighbors are colored yet. So assign the lowest color, 0. But then, when we color 4 and 10 later, they can't be 0 if they are connected to 8.\n\nWait, but this approach might not work because the nodes after 8 may have dependencies. Let's see.\n\nBut according to the order, node 8 is processed after 27. So when we process node 8, none of its neighbors (4,35,10,22) have been processed yet. So node 8 can take color 0. Then, when we process 4, 35, etc., they will have to avoid conflicting with node 8.\n\nBut maybe a better way is to process nodes in order of descending degree and color each node with the lowest possible color not used by its already colored neighbors.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Node 27: color 0.\n\n2. Node 8: neighbors not colored yet. Assign color 0. Wait, but if node 8 is connected to 4, which is a neighbor of 27 (color 0). So when we process node 8, node 4 hasn't been colored yet. So node 8 can be colored 0. Then, when node 4 is processed, it's connected to 27 (0) and 8 (0). So node 4 must be colored 1 or 2. Similarly, node 10 is connected to 27 (0) and 8 (0), so when processed, must be 1 or 2.\n\nBut perhaps this will cause conflicts down the line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe processing node 8 after node 4 and 10.\n\nBut the order is set to degree, so node 8 is higher than node 4 and 10 (which have lower degrees). So node 8 is processed before 4 and 10.\n\nSo proceeding:\n\n1. Node 27: color 0.\n\n2. Node 8: neighbors (4,35,10,22) not colored. Assign color 0.\n\n3. Node 9: neighbors (42,14,16,30). Assign color 0 (if possible). Check if any neighbors are colored. None yet. Assign 0.\n\n4. Node 18: neighbors (35,37,40,36). Assign color 0. Check if any are colored. None yet. Assign 0.\n\n5. Node 0: neighbors (36,7,37). Assign color 0. But node 18 (color 0) is connected to 36 and 37. If node 0's neighbors (36,37) are not yet colored, but node 18 is connected to 36 and 37. For example, node 36 is connected to node 18 (color 0), so when we get to node 36, it can't be 0.\n\nProceeding:\n\n5. Node 0: color 0.\n\nNow, when processing node 36 later, which is connected to node 0 (0) and 18 (0), so node 36 must be colored 1 or 2.\n\nContinuing:\n\n6. Node 6: neighbors (21,23,31). Assign color 0 if possible. Check if any neighbors are colored. Node 23 is a neighbor of 27 (color 0), but node 23 hasn't been processed yet. So node 6 can be colored 0.\n\n7. Node 12: neighbors (23,32,11). Assign color 0. None of these are colored yet. Assign 0.\n\n8. Node 21: neighbors (6,30,44). Node 6 is color 0. So node 21 can't be 0. Assign the next color, 1.\n\n9. Node 23: neighbors (6,27,12). Node 6 is 0, 27 is 0, 12 is 0. So node 23 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\n10. Node 30: neighbors (21,25,9). Node 21 is 1, node 9 is 0. So node 30 can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\n11. Node 31: neighbors (44,43,6). Node 6 is 0. Assign color 1.\n\n12. Node 32: neighbors (13,35,12). Node 12 is 0. Assign color 1.\n\n13. Node 35: neighbors (18,8,32). Node 18 is 0, 8 is 0, 32 is 1. So node 35 can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\n14. Node 36: neighbors (0,18,29). Node 0 is 0, 18 is 0. Assign 1.\n\n15. Node 41: neighbors (16,27,14). Node 27 is 0. Assign color 1.\n\n16. Node 44: neighbors (31,21,3). Node 31 is 1, 21 is 1. Assign 0.\n\nNow, proceeding to lower-degree nodes.\n\n17. Node 4: neighbors (27,8). Both are 0. Assign 1.\n\n18. Node 10: neighbors (27,8). Both 0. Assign 1.\n\nBut node 8 is color 0, node 10 is connected to 8, so 10 can't be 0. Assigning 1 is okay.\n\n19. Node 20: neighbors (26,27). 27 is 0. Assign 1.\n\n20. Node 38: neighbors (25,27). 27 is 0. Assign 1.\n\n21. Node 22: neighbor (8). 8 is 0. Assign 1.\n\n22. Node 25: neighbors (38,30). 38 is 1, 30 is 2. Assign 0.\n\n23. Node 26: neighbor (20). 20 is 1. Assign 0.\n\n24. Node 37: neighbors (18,0). 18 and 0 are both 0. Assign 1.\n\n25. Node 40: neighbors (18,43). 18 is 0. Assign 1.\n\n26. Node 42: neighbors (9,34). 9 is 0. Assign 1.\n\n27. Node 43: neighbors (40,31). 40 is 1, 31 is 1. Assign 0.\n\n28. Node 7: neighbor (0). 0 is 0. Assign 1.\n\n29. Node 1: neighbors (17,13). Assign 0.\n\n30. Node 3: neighbor (44). 44 is 0. Assign 1.\n\n31. Node 5: Not mentioned in edges, so degree 0. Assign 0.\n\n32. Node 2: Not mentioned in edges. Assign 0.\n\nWait, the nodes listed in the problem are 0 to 44. But in the edges provided, some nodes may not be present. For example, node 2, 5, 19, 22, 24, 28, 33, 34, 39, etc. But in the problem statement, the nodes are explicitly listed as 0 through 44. So each must be colored.\n\nLet me check the nodes mentioned in the edges:\n\nNodes present in edges: 0,1,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,25,26,27,29,30,31,32,34,35,36,37,38,40,41,42,43,44.\n\nMissing nodes: 2,5,19,24,28,33,39.\n\nWait, node 19 is present (connected to 34). So missing nodes are 2,5,24,28,33,39.\n\nThese nodes are part of the graph (as per problem statement) but have no edges. So they can be colored any color, but since the problem requires using exactly 3 colors, we can assign them any color, but preferably 0,1,2.\n\nNow, continuing to assign colors to remaining nodes:\n\nNode 2: no edges. Assign 0.\n\nNode 5: no edges. Assign 0.\n\nNode 19: connected to 34. Node 34 hasn't been processed yet. Wait, node 34 is connected to 42 and 19. Node 42 is colored 1. So node 34 can't be 1. Assign 0. Then node 19 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 24: no edges. Assign 0.\n\nNode 28: no edges. Assign 0.\n\nNode 33: no edges. Assign 0.\n\nNode 39: no edges. Assign 0.\n\nNode 29: connected to 36 (color 1). Assign 0.\n\nNode 34: connected to 42 (1) and 19. Node 42 is 1. Assign 0. Then node 19 is connected to 34 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode 39: no edges. Assign 0.\n\nNow, compiling all assignments:\n\n27:0\n\n8:0\n\n9:0\n\n18:0\n\n0:0\n\n6:0\n\n12:0\n\n21:1\n\n23:1\n\n30:2\n\n31:1\n\n32:1\n\n35:2\n\n36:1\n\n41:1\n\n44:0\n\n4:1\n\n10:1\n\n20:1\n\n38:1\n\n22:1\n\n25:0\n\n26:0\n\n37:1\n\n40:1\n\n42:1\n\n43:0\n\n7:1\n\n1:0\n\n3:1\n\n5:0\n\n2:0\n\n19:1 (since 34 is 0)\n\n34:0\n\n24:0\n\n28:0\n\n33:0\n\n39:0\n\nWait, but let's check for conflicts:\n\nFor example, node 8 (0) is connected to 4 (1), 35 (2), 10 (1), 22 (1). All different from 8's color. So okay.\n\nNode 0 (0) is connected to 36 (1),7 (1),37 (1). All different. Good.\n\nNode 9 (0) is connected to 42 (1),14 (not colored yet?),16 (not colored yet),30 (2). So need to check 14,16.\n\nProcessing node 14: connected to 9 (0) and 41 (1). So 14 can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\nNode 14:2.\n\nNode 16: connected to 9 (0) and 41 (1). Can't be 0 or 1. Assign 2.\n\nNode 16:2.\n\nNode 17: connected to 15 and 1. Node 1 is 0. 15 hasn't been colored. Node 15: no edges except 17. Assign 0. Then node 17 can't be 0. Assign 1.\n\nNode 15:0.\n\nNode 17:1.\n\nNode 13: connected to 32 (1) and 1 (0). Assign 2.\n\nNode 13:2.\n\nNode 11: connected to 12 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode 11:1.\n\nNode 19: connected to 34 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode 34:0.\n\nNode 3: connected to 44 (0). Assign 1.\n\nNode 44:0. Yes.\n\nNode 40:1 (connected to 18 (0) and 43 (0)). Wait, node 40 is connected to 43 (color 0). So node 40 can't be 0. It was assigned 1, which is correct.\n\nNode 43:0 (connected to 40 (1) and 31 (1)). Correct.\n\nNode 31:1 (connected to 44 (0), 43 (0), and 6 (0). So 31's color is 1, which is okay.\n\nNode 21:1 (connected to 6 (0), 30 (2), 44 (0). Correct.\n\nNode 30:2 (connected to 21 (1), 25 (0), 9 (0).

Let's start by understanding the structure of the graph. The nodes are from 0 to 13, and there are several edges. The problem is to assign each node a color (0 or 1) such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. If I can do this, it means the graph is bipartite. If not, then it's not possible. But the question states that I should provide a valid coloring, so I'm assuming the graph is bipartite here.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the edges again to make sure I have them right. The edges are:\n2-4, 1-2, 0-10, 6-11, 4-9, 0-6, 0-12, 11-12, 3-13, 5-9, 5-6, 1-6, 7-11, 5-12, 3-11.\n\nHmm. Let's see. To check if it's bipartite, maybe I can try to assign colors in a BFS manner, keeping track of each node's color and ensuring no conflicts.\n\nLet me start with node 0. Let's assign it color 0. Then its neighbors (10, 6, 12) must be color 1. Then look at their neighbors:\n\nNode 6's neighbors: 0 (color 0), 11, 5, 1. So 11,5,1 must be color 1's opposite, which is 0. Wait, but if node 6 is color 1, then 11,5,1 must be 0. Let's check:\n\nWait, let's structure this step by step.\n\nStart with node 0: color 0.\n\nNeighbors of 0: 10, 6, 12. Assign them color 1.\n\nNow, look at node 10's neighbors: only 0 (already colored). So no issues there.\n\nNext, node 6: color 1. Its neighbors are 0 (color 0), 11 (needs color 0), 5 (needs color 0), and 1 (needs color 0). Wait, but node 1 is connected to 2 and 6. So if node 1 is color 0, then node 2 (connected to 1) must be color 1. Then node 2 is connected to 4, which would need color 0. Then node 4 is connected to 9, which needs color 1. Node 9 is connected to 4 and 5. Wait, 5 is connected to 9, 6, 12. So if 5 is color 0, then 9 (connected to 5) must be 1. But 9 is also connected to 4, which is color 0. So 9's color would be 1, that's okay.\n\nLet me track this step by step.\n\nAssigning colors using BFS:\n\nStart with node 0: color 0. Add to queue.\n\nQueue: [0]\n\nProcess node 0. Neighbors 10,6,12. Set their color to 1. Add them to queue.\n\nColors now:\n0:0\n10:1\n6:1\n12:1\n\nQueue becomes [10,6,12]\n\nProcess node 10. Its neighbors are 0 (already colored). No new assignments. Queue now [6,12].\n\nProcess node 6. Its neighbors: 0 (color 0), 11,5,1. Assign 11,5,1 to color 0. Check if any of them are already colored. None are yet. Assign and add to queue.\n\nColors:\n6:1\n11:0\n5:0\n1:0\n\nQueue becomes [12, 11,5,1]\n\nProcess node 12. Neighbors: 0 (color 0), 11,5. 11 is already going to be 0 (from previous step). Wait, 12's color is 1. So neighbors of 12 (11 and 5) should be 0. Which is what's already assigned. So 11 and 5 are color 0. That's okay. No conflict. So 12 is color 1, 11 is 0, 5 is 0. Then, when node 12 is processed, any other neighbors? 5's color is 0.\n\nSo after processing 12, queue is [11,5,1].\n\nProcess node 11. Its neighbors: 6 (1), 12 (1), 7,3. 6 and 12 are color 1, so node 11 is color 0 (as assigned). Its neighbors 7 and 3 need to be color 1. Assign and add to queue.\n\nColors:\n11:0\n7:1\n3:1\n\nQueue becomes [5,1,7,3]\n\nProcess node 5. Neighbors: 9,6 (1), 12 (1). 5 is color 0. So 9 must be color 1. Assign 9 to 1 and add to queue.\n\nColors:\n5:0\n9:1\n\nQueue becomes [1,7,3,9]\n\nProcess node 1. Neighbors: 2,6 (1). 1 is color 0. So node 2 must be color 1. Assign and add to queue.\n\nColors:\n1:0\n2:1\n\nQueue becomes [7,3,9,2]\n\nProcess node 7. Neighbors:11 (0). So 7 is color 1, which is correct. No new assignments. Queue: [3,9,2].\n\nProcess node 3. Neighbors:13, 11 (0). 3 is color 1. So 13 must be color 0. Assign and add to queue.\n\nColors:\n3:1\n13:0\n\nQueue becomes [9,2,13]\n\nProcess node 9. Neighbors:4,5 (0). 9 is color 1. So 4 must be color 0. Assign and add to queue.\n\nColors:\n9:1\n4:0\n\nQueue becomes [2,13,4]\n\nProcess node 2. Neighbors:4 (0), 1 (0). 2 is color 1. Neighbor 4 is color 0. Okay. No conflict. No new assignments.\n\nQueue becomes [13,4].\n\nProcess node 13. Neighbors:3 (1). 13 is color 0. Correct. No new neighbors. Queue now [4].\n\nProcess node 4. Neighbors:2 (1),9 (1). 4 is color 0. Correct. No issues.\n\nAll nodes processed. Let's check all edges for conflicts.\n\nCheck edges:\n\n2-4: 2 is 1, 4 is 0. Okay.\n1-2: 1 is 0, 2 is 1. Okay.\n0-10: 0 is 0, 10 is 1. Okay.\n6-11: 6 is 1, 11 is 0. Okay.\n4-9:4 is 0, 9 is 1. Okay.\n0-6: 0 is 0, 6 is 1. Okay.\n0-12:0 is 0, 12 is 1. Okay.\n11-12:11 is 0, 12 is 1. Okay.\n3-13:3 is 1, 13 is 0. Okay.\n5-9:5 is 0,9 is 1. Okay.\n5-6:5 is 0,6 is 1. Okay.\n1-6:1 is 0,6 is 1. Okay.\n7-11:7 is 1,11 is 0. Okay.\n5-12:5 is 0,12 is 1. Okay.\n3-11:3 is 1,11 is 0. Okay.\n\nAll edges seem to have different colors. So the coloring is valid. Now, the colors assigned are:\n\n0:0\n1:0\n2:1\n3:1\n4:0\n5:0\n6:1\n7:1\n8: ??? Wait, wait, I didn't assign color to node 8. Oh no! Oh right, the nodes are 0-13, so 14 nodes. Wait, in the problem statement, the nodes listed are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. That's 14 nodes. But in the edge list, node 8 is not connected to anything. So node 8 is an isolated node. So in that case, when assigning colors, since it's isolated, we can assign either color 0 or 1, but since the problem says 'exactly' 2 colors, but we can use either. So, in my BFS traversal, I must have missed it. Because in the initial steps, none of the edges involve node 8, so when building the adjacency list, node 8 is not connected to anything. So in the current coloring, I haven't assigned a color to node 8. So that's a problem.\n\nOh right! So the list of nodes includes 8 even though it has no edges. So the answer must include all nodes, including 8. So in the previous steps, the BFS didn't reach node 8 because it's isolated. So I need to assign it a color. Since it's not connected to any other node, we can assign either 0 or 1. Let's pick 0 for simplicity.\n\nSo node 8's color is 0.\n\nNow, let's make the list:\n\nAll nodes from 0 to 13:\n\n0:0\n1:0\n2:1\n3:1\n4:0\n5:0\n6:1\n7:1\n8:0\n9:1\n10:1\n11:0\n12:1\n13:0\n\nWait, but in our BFS traversal, node 7 was assigned color 1 (as per the step where 11's neighbors are 7 and 3, which were assigned 1). Yes. So node 7 is 1, node 8 is 0, node 9 is 1, node 10 is 1 (from earlier), node 11 is 0, node 12 is 1, node 13 is 0.\n\nNow, compiling the list:\n\n[[0,0], [1,0], [2,1], [3,1], [4,0], [5,0], [6,1], [7,1], [8,0], [9,1], [10,1], [11,0], [12,1], [13,0]]\n\nWait, but the problem said to use exactly two colors. But assigning node 8 to 0 is fine. So the answer includes all nodes. Let me check again. The nodes are 0-13 inclusive, which is 14 nodes. The list here has 14 entries. Each node is assigned a color. All edges are properly colored. And node 8, being isolated, is assigned 0. That's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the valid coloring scheme is as above.\n\n\nAnswer: [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 0], [5, 0], [6, 1], [7, 1], [8, 0], [9, 1], [10, 1], [11, 0], [12, 1], [13, 0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are an expert in graph theory and coloring.
