The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into.

You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n8|4|32|8\n16|128|8|16\n4|2|32|4\n32|16|8|64\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
