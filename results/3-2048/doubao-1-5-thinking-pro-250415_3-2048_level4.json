The goal is to merge tiles to maximize scores and strategically position larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Swiping left moves all tiles in row 3 to the left. The `2` in column 0 stays, and the `2` in column 3 shifts left to column 1 (since columns 0 is occupied). This results in `[2, 2, 0, 0]` in row 3. The adjacent `2`s merge into a `4`, yielding a score of 4. The merged `4` ends up in the bottom-left corner (row 3, column 0), a strategic corner position.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Swiping right moves all tiles in row 3 to the right. The `2` in column 0 shifts right to column 2, and the `2` in column 3 stays. This results in `[0, 0, 2, 2]` in row 3. The adjacent `2`s merge into a `4`, yielding a score of 4. The merged `4` ends up in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), another strategic corner position.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Swiping up moves the `2`s in row 3 to the top row (row 0), resulting in `[2, 0, 0, 2]` in row 0. The `2`s are not adjacent, so no merging occurs. No score is gained, and the tiles are spread out, which is less strategic.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Swiping down does not move any tiles (they are already in the bottom row) and there are no adjacent equal tiles to merge. This is an invalid move as no tiles can shift or merge.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT merge the `2`s into a `4` and place the merged tile in a corner. However, LEFT positions the `4` in the bottom-left corner, which is a common strategic corner for building larger tiles. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on strategic goals like consolidating tiles and positioning larger numbers in corners.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 4|0|0|0  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left. Row 1 (with 2 in column 3) becomes [2, 0, 0, 0]. Row 3 (with 4 in column 0) remains [4, 0, 0, 0].  \n   - Result: No merges, but tiles consolidate left.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right. Row 3 (with 4 in column 0) becomes [0, 0, 0, 4]. Row 1 (with 2 in column 3) remains [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n   - Result: No merges, tiles consolidate right.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift upward. Column 0 (with 4 in row 3) moves to row 0, column 0. Column 3 (with 2 in row 1) moves to row 0, column 3.  \n   - Result: Row 0 becomes [4, 0, 0, 2]. Larger tiles (4 and 2) are positioned in the top row, which may facilitate future merges if new tiles appear nearby.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift downward. Column 0 (4 in row 3) stays, and column 3 (2 in row 1) moves to row 3, column 3.  \n   - Result: Row 3 becomes [4, 0, 0, 2]. Tiles spread across the bottom row, but no immediate strategic advantage.  \n\n### Strategic Choice:\nThe goal is to position larger tiles in a corner and prepare for future merges. Swiping UP consolidates the 4 (largest tile) in the top-left corner (row 0, column 0) and the 2 in the top-right corner (row 0, column 3). This aligns them in the top row, increasing the potential for future merges if new tiles (2 or 4) spawn in adjacent columns.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|0|0|2  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|2|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: [4, 0, 0, 2] shifts left to [4, 2, 0, 0] (no merging).  \n- Row 1: Remains [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n- Row 2: [0, 0, 2, 0] shifts left to [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merging).  \n- Row 3: Remains [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n- Result: Tiles are spread out; no merging occurs. The 4 is in the top-left corner, but 2s are not aligned for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: [4, 0, 0, 2] shifts right to [0, 0, 4, 2] (no merging).  \n- Row 1: Remains [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n- Row 2: [0, 0, 2, 0] shifts right to [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merging).  \n- Row 3: Remains [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n- Result: Tiles are pushed right, but the 4 is not in a corner, and 2s are not aligned for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Column 0: [4, 0, 0, 0] shifts up to [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merging).  \n- Column 1: [0, 0, 0, 0] remains [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n- Column 2: [0, 0, 2, 0] shifts up to [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merging).  \n- Column 3: [2, 0, 0, 0] shifts up to [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merging).  \n- Result: Row 0 becomes [4, 0, 2, 2]. The two 2s in Row 0 (columns 2 and 3) are now adjacent horizontally. This alignment sets up a potential merge in the next move (e.g., swiping LEFT to merge the 2s into a 4).  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Column 0: [4, 0, 0, 0] shifts down to [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merging).  \n- Column 1: [0, 0, 0, 0] remains [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n- Column 2: [0, 0, 2, 0] shifts down to [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merging).  \n- Column 3: [2, 0, 0, 0] shifts down to [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merging).  \n- Result: Row 3 becomes [4, 0, 2, 2]. The 2s are adjacent but in the bottom row, which is less strategic for future merges compared to aligning them in the top row.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping **UP** aligns the 2s in Row 0 (columns 2 and 3), making them adjacent and setting up a potential merge in the next move. This is more strategic than other directions, as it positions smaller tiles for future combinations while keeping the largest tile (4) in a corner.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|0|2|2  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|2|0|0  \n\n\n### 1. Swipe LEFT  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The non-zero tiles are [4, 2, 2]. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4). Result: [4, 4, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 1**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 2**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left. The 2 moves to the first position. Result: [2, 0, 0, 0].  \n\n**Post-LEFT Board**:  \n4|4|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n2|0|0|0  \n\nThis move merges two 2s into 4 (score +4) and leaves two adjacent 4s in Row 0, which can merge in future moves.  \n\n\n### 2. Swipe RIGHT  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The non-zero tiles are [4, 2, 2]. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), and the 4 shifts to the second position. Result: [0, 4, 0, 4].  \n- **Row 1**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 2**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right. The 2 moves to the last position. Result: [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n\n**Post-RIGHT Board**:  \n0|4|0|4  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|2  \n\nThis move also merges two 2s into 4 (score +4), but the resulting 4s in Row 0 are not adjacent, making future merges harder.  \n\n\n### 3. Swipe UP  \n- **Columns**: Tiles shift upward. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges.  \n- **Result**: All non-zero tiles stack at the top of their columns.  \n**Post-UP Board**:  \n4|2|2|2  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n\nNo score gain, and tiles are spread out with no immediate merging potential.  \n\n\n### 4. Swipe DOWN  \n- **Columns**: Tiles shift downward. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges.  \n- **Result**: All non-zero tiles stack at the bottom of their columns.  \n**Post-DOWN Board**:  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n4|2|2|2  \n\nNo score gain, and tiles are spread out with no immediate merging potential.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nLEFT and RIGHT both merge two 2s into 4 (score +4), but LEFT leaves two adjacent 4s in Row 0, which can merge in future moves. UP and DOWN do not merge any tiles and offer no immediate benefits. Thus, LEFT is the optimal move.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the game board and rules:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|4|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 2|0|0|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: The two adjacent 4s merge into 8 (score +8). Tiles shift left, resulting in `8|0|0|0`.  \n- **Row 1**: The 2 in column 3 shifts left to column 0, resulting in `2|0|0|0`.  \n- **Row 3**: The 2 in column 0 remains, resulting in `2|0|0|0`.  \n- **Result Before New Tile**:  \n  ```\n  8|0|0|0  \n  2|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  2|0|0|0  \n  ```  \n- **Strategy**: The 8 (largest tile) is placed in the top-left corner (a strategic corner). The 2s in column 0 can potentially merge vertically in future moves (e.g., moving UP), supporting long-term growth.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: The two 4s shift right and merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in `0|0|0|8`.  \n- **Row 1**: The 2 in column 3 remains, resulting in `0|0|0|2`.  \n- **Row 3**: The 2 in column 0 shifts right to column 3, resulting in `0|0|0|2`.  \n- **Result Before New Tile**:  \n  ```\n  0|0|0|8  \n  0|0|0|2  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|2  \n  ```  \n- **Strategy**: The 8 is placed in the top-right corner. However, the 2s in column 3 are less aligned with the 8 for future merges compared to the LEFT move.  \n\n\n#### **UP Move**:\n- **Columns Processed Vertically**:  \n  - Column 0: 4 (row 0) and 2 (row 3) stack to `4|2|0|0`.  \n  - Column 1: 4 (row 0) shifts up to `4|0|0|0`.  \n  - Column 3: 2 (row 1) shifts up to `2|0|0|0`.  \n- **Row 0 After Shifting**: `4|4|0|2` (two 4s merge into 8, score +8), resulting in `8|0|0|2`.  \n- **Result Before New Tile**:  \n  ```\n  8|0|0|2  \n  2|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  ```  \n- **Issue**: The 2 in row 0, column 3 blocks the row, limiting future left\/right moves.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Move**:\n- Tiles shift down, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n- **Result Before New Tile**:  \n  ```\n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  4|0|0|0  \n  2|4|0|2  \n  ```  \n- **Issue**: No score gain, making this the weakest option.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT move merges the 4s into 8 (score +8), places the largest tile in a corner, and aligns smaller tiles (2s) in a column for potential future merges. This aligns best with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners and maximizing future merge opportunities.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 3: 2|0|0|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   8|0|0|0  \n   2|0|0|0  \n   4|0|0|0  \n   2|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   No score is added, and only 12 empty tiles remain.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur. The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   0|0|0|8  \n   0|0|0|2  \n   0|0|0|4  \n   0|0|0|2  \n   ```  \n   No score is added, and only 12 empty tiles remain.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward, merging where possible. Column 0 (values [8, 2, 0, 2]) has two 2s that merge into 4 (score +4). Column 3 (value [0, 0, 4, 0]) shifts 4 to row 0. The resulting board is:  \n   ```\n   8|0|0|4  \n   4|0|0|0  \n   0|0|0|0  \n   0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   13 empty tiles remain, and the largest tile (8) is positioned in the top-left corner (a strategic corner).\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward, merging where possible. Column 0 (values [8, 2, 0, 2]) has two 2s that merge into 4 (score +4). Column 3 (value [0, 0, 4, 0]) shifts 4 to row 3. The resulting board is:  \n   ```\n   0|0|0|0  \n   8|0|0|0  \n   0|0|0|0  \n   4|0|0|4  \n   ```  \n   13 empty tiles remain, but the largest tile (8) is in row 1, not a corner.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is optimal because it merges tiles to gain score, leaves more empty spaces, and positions the largest tile (8) in a corner (top-left), which is strategically better for future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|0|0|4  \nRow 1: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**:  \n- Each row shifts tiles to the left.  \n  - Row 0: [8, 0, 0, 4] → [8, 4, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n  - Row 1: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n  - Row 2: [2, 0, 0, 0] → [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n  - Row 3: No change.  \n- Result: Tiles cluster on the left, but no merges occur. Future merges are unlikely as 4s are not aligned.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**:  \n- Each row shifts tiles to the right.  \n  - Row 0: [8, 0, 0, 4] → [0, 0, 8, 4] (no merge).  \n  - Row 1: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merge).  \n  - Row 2: [2, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merge).  \n  - Row 3: No change.  \n- Result: Tiles cluster on the right. Notably, a 4 in Row 0 (Column 3) and a 4 in Row 1 (Column 3) are now aligned vertically in Column 3. This sets up a potential merge if the next move is UP (merging the two 4s into an 8, which would earn 8 points).  \n\n\n#### **UP**:  \n- Columns shift tiles upward.  \n  - Column 0: [8, 4, 2, 0] → [8, 4, 2, 0] (no merge, already as high as possible).  \n  - Columns 1-3: All zeros, no change.  \n- Result: No movement or merges. The board remains unchanged.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**:  \n- Columns shift tiles downward.  \n  - Column 0: [8, 4, 2, 0] → [0, 8, 4, 2] (no merge).  \n  - Column 3: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merge).  \n  - Columns 1-2: No change.  \n- Result: Tiles cluster at the bottom, but no merges occur. No strategic alignment for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving RIGHT aligns the two 4s vertically in Column 3, creating a strategic opportunity for a merge in the next move (e.g., by swiping UP). This is the most favorable direction to set up future scoring.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given 4x4 grid.

Smaller tiles (4 and 8) cluster vertically in the right column (column 3), setting up potential future merges (e.g., 4 and 4, 8 and 8).  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift up in each column.  \n   - Column 1: `[0,0,0,8]` → `[8,0,0,0]` (8 moves to row 0, column 1).  \n   - Column 2: `[2,0,0,0]` → `[2,0,0,0]` (2 stays in row 0, column 2).  \n   - Column 3: `[16,4,0,0]` → `[16,4,0,0]` (16 stays in row 0, column 3).  \n   - Result: 16 remains in the top-right corner, but 8 and 2 are scattered horizontally in row 0, reducing future merge potential.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down in each column.  \n   - Column 2: `[2,0,0,0]` → `[0,0,0,2]` (2 moves to row 3, column 2).  \n   - Column 3: `[16,4,0,0]` → `[0,0,16,4]` (16 moves to row 2, column 3; 4 moves to row 3, column 3).  \n   - Result: The largest tile (16) moves from the top-right corner to row 2, column 3, weakening the corner cluster.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving **RIGHT** keeps the largest tile (16) in the top-right corner and clusters smaller tiles (4 and 8) vertically in the right column, maximizing future merge potential. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and organizing smaller tiles for strategic merging.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

LEFT:\n- Each row shifts tiles left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist to merge.  \n- Result: No merges, no score. Tiles remain in their original positions (just shifted left into empty spaces).  \n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- Each row shifts tiles right, but no adjacent equal tiles exist to merge.  \n- Result: No merges, no score. Tiles shift right into empty spaces but remain unmerged.  \n\n#### 3. UP:\n- Columns are processed vertically (tiles shift upward).  \n  - **Column 0**: [2, 8, 8, 8]. The two middle 8s (rows 1 and 2) merge into 16 (score +16). The remaining 8 (row 3) shifts up to row 2.  \n  - Other columns have no merges.  \n- Result: Board becomes:  \n  Row 0: 2 | 16 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 1: 16 | 4 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 2: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n- Score: +16.  \n\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- Columns are processed vertically (tiles shift downward).  \n  - **Column 0**: [2, 8, 8, 8]. The bottom two 8s (rows 2 and 3) merge into 16 (score +16). The 8 in row 1 shifts down to row 2, and the 2 in row 0 shifts down to row 1.  \n  - **Column 1**: [16, 4, 0, 0]. Tiles 16 (row 0) and 4 (row 1) shift down to rows 3 and 2, respectively.  \n- Result: Board becomes:  \n  Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 1: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 2: 8 | 4 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 3: 16 | 16 | 0 | 0  \n- Score: +16.  \n\n\n### Key Strategic Insight:\nThe DOWN move positions two 16s adjacent in the bottom row (row 3). This sets up a future merge (e.g., swiping LEFT next turn would merge the 16s into 32, yielding +32 score). In contrast, the UP move leaves the 16 in row 1, which is less strategically positioned for future merges. Keeping larger tiles in a corner (here, the bottom row) aligns with optimal 2048 strategy.  \n\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to merge tiles for higher scores and set up future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 2|0|0|0\nRow 2: 8|16|4|0\nRow 3: 16|4|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist to merge. All rows remain mostly unchanged (e.g., row 3: `16|4|0|0` stays the same).  \n   - **Result**: No merges, score 0.  \n\n2. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift up, but vertical adjacency checks show no equal tiles to merge. Columns like column 0 (`0,2,8,16`) and column 1 (`0,0,16,4`) have distinct values.  \n   - **Result**: No merges, score 0.  \n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift down, but vertical adjacency checks also show no equal tiles to merge. For example, column 0 (`0,2,8,16`) remains unmerged.  \n   - **Result**: No merges, score 0.  \n\n4. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right. Let’s process each row:  \n     - Row 1 (`2|0|0|0`) becomes `0|0|0|2` (2 moves to the rightmost empty space).  \n     - Row 2 (`8|16|4|0`) becomes `0|8|16|4` (tiles shift right, filling empty spaces).  \n     - Row 3 (`16|4|0|0`) becomes `0|0|16|4` (tiles shift right, filling empty spaces).  \n   - **Key Setup**: After shifting, row 2 (column 2) and row 3 (column 2) both have `16`, creating vertical adjacency in column 2. This sets up a future UP swipe to merge these `16`s into `32`, yielding a higher score.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe RIGHT swipe strategically positions two `16`s vertically adjacent in column 2, enabling a merge in the next move. This setup is better than other directions, which do not create such opportunities.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential, score gain, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### LEFT and RIGHT Moves:\n- **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles merge.

The board remains mostly unchanged with no score gain.\n\n### UP Move:\n- Columns are processed to shift tiles upward. Key merges occur in Column 2 (16 + 16 → 32, score +32) and Column 3 (4 + 4 → 8, score +8). After merging, the board (before new tile) becomes:\n  ```\n  0|8|4|2\n  0|0|32|8\n  0|0|0|0\n  0|0|0|0\n  ```\n  Larger tiles (32, 8) are in the middle row (row 1).\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- Columns are processed to shift tiles downward. Key merges occur in Column 2 (16 + 16 → 32, score +32) and Column 3 (4 + 4 → 8, score +8). After merging, the board (before new tile) becomes:\n  ```\n  0|0|0|0\n  0|0|4|2\n  0|0|0|0\n  0|8|32|8\n  ```\n  Larger tiles (32, 8) are in the bottom row (row 3), aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and DOWN yield the same score (40), but DOWN positions larger tiles (32, 8) in the bottom row, which is more strategic for building toward a corner (e.g., bottom-right) for future merges. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

The first two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in `[16,32,8,0]`.  \n   **Outcome**: Tiles shift left, merges occur, and the grid remains mostly open (rows 0 and 1 stay empty).  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - **Row 0 & 1**: Remain unchanged (all zeros).  \n   - **Row 2**: `[0,0,4,2]` shifts right but remains `[0,0,4,2]` (no merges).  \n   - **Row 3**: `[8,8,32,8]` shifts right. The two 8s in columns 0 and 1 merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in `[0,16,32,8]`.  \n   **Outcome**: Tiles shift right, merges occur, but row 2 remains unshifted.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed upward. Tiles in column 0 (8), column 1 (8), column 2 (4, 32), and column 3 (2, 8) shift up to fill empty rows 0 and 1.  \n   **Outcome**: Row 0 becomes `[8,8,4,2]`, row 1 becomes `[0,0,32,8]`, and rows 2-3 empty. No merges occur, and the grid fills up rows 0 and 1, reducing future flexibility.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles are already at the bottom of their columns (no empty spaces below them). No movement or merges occur.  \n   **Outcome**: Invalid move (no tiles shift or merge).  \n\n\n### Strategy Consideration:  \nThe goal is to keep larger tiles in a corner and maintain grid openness. The largest tile (32) is in row 3, column 2. Swiping LEFT moves the 32 closer to the left corner (row 3, column 1) and merges the 8s in row 3 for immediate score gain. Swiping RIGHT also merges 8s but leaves the 32 in row 3, column 2. Swiping UP fills rows 0 and 1, reducing empty spaces. Swiping DOWN is invalid.  \n\nLEFT is optimal as it merges tiles, maintains grid openness, and positions the 32 closer to the corner for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

Rows 0 and 3 remain unchanged. No merges occur, so no score gain.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift upward. Columns are processed to shift non-zero tiles to the top. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column, so no merges occur. The board rearranges but with no score gain.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift downward. Columns are processed to shift non-zero tiles to the bottom. Key observation:  \n  - **Column 0**: [0, 16, 4, 16].

This sets up a potential future merge if the 4 in Row 2, Column 3 can be moved.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed top-to-bottom.  \n   - Column 0: `0|16|4|16` → `16|4|16|0` (non-zeros shift up, no merges).  \n   - Column 1: `0|0|2|32` → `2|32|0|0` (non-zeros shift up, no merges).  \n   - Column 2: `0|0|16|8` → `16|8|0|0` (non-zeros shift up, no merges).  \n   - Column 3: `0|0|4|16` → `4|16|0|0` (non-zeros shift up, no merges).  \n   - **Outcome**: Tiles shift upward, but no merges occur. Larger tiles (e.g., 32) move away from the bottom row, which is suboptimal for corner strategy.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom-to-top.  \n   - Column 0: `0|16|4|16` → `0|16|4|16` (no change, non-zeros already bottom-aligned).  \n   - Column 1: `0|0|2|32` → `0|0|2|32` (no change, non-zeros already bottom-aligned).  \n   - Column 2: `0|0|16|8` → `0|0|16|8` (no change, non-zeros already bottom-aligned).  \n   - Column 3: `0|0|4|16` → `0|0|4|16` (no change, non-zeros already bottom-aligned).  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges, grid remains unchanged.  \n\n\n### Strategic Rationale:\nThe RIGHT swipe moves the 16 in Row 1 to Column 3, aligning it vertically with the 16 in Row 3, Column 3. While they are currently separated by the 4 in Row 2, Column 3, this alignment creates a potential future merge opportunity if the 4 can be shifted (e.g., via a subsequent UP swipe). This move also keeps larger tiles (e.g., 32 in Row 3, Column 1) in the bottom row, which is consistent with the 2048 strategy of concentrating larger tiles in a corner for better merging potential.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to maximize merging opportunities and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|4|0|16\nRow 2: 4|2|16|4\nRow 3: 16|32|8|16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: No change (all zeros).  \n   - Row 1: [0,4,0,16] → shifts left to [4,16,0,0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [4,2,16,4] → no empty spaces to shift (remains unchanged).  \n   - Row 3: [16,32,8,16] → no empty spaces to shift (remains unchanged).  \n   - Result: Minimal movement; no merges. Poor for building larger tiles.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: No change (all zeros).  \n   - Row 1: [0,4,0,16] → shifts right to [0,0,4,16] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [4,2,16,4] → no empty spaces to shift (remains unchanged).  \n   - Row 3: [16,32,8,16] → no empty spaces to shift (remains unchanged).  \n   - Result: Minimal movement; no merges. Similar to LEFT but less effective.\n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are already filled from the bottom (few empty spaces).  \n   - Tiles in columns 0–3 cannot shift further down (no movement).  \n   - Result: Invalid move (no tiles shift or merge).\n\n4. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed to shift tiles upward:  \n     - **Column 0**: [0,0,4,16] → shifts up to [4,16,0,0] (no merges).  \n     - **Column 1**: [0,4,2,32] → shifts up to [4,2,32,0] (no merges).  \n     - **Column 2**: [0,0,16,8] → shifts up to [16,8,0,0] (no merges).  \n     - **Column 3**: [0,16,4,16] → shifts up to [16,4,16,0] (no merges).  \n   - Post-shift board:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 4|4|16|16  \n     Row 1: 16|2|8|4  \n     Row 2: 0|32|0|16  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - Key Insight: Row 0 now has adjacent 4s (columns 0–1) and adjacent 16s (columns 2–3). This sets up future merges (e.g., swiping LEFT next would merge the 4s into 8 and 16s into 32, generating significant score). Larger tiles (32, 16) are consolidated in middle rows, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners\/rows for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move, as it creates adjacent equal tiles in Row 0, enabling high-value merges in subsequent moves and strategically positioning larger tiles.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, score gain, and future tile alignment.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|4|16|16  \nRow 1: 16|2|8|4  \nRow 2: 16|32|0|16  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), and the two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). Result: 8|32|0|0.  \n- **Row 1**: No adjacent duplicates; tiles shift left but remain 16|2|8|4 (no score).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left (16, 32, 16, 0) with no merges (no score).  \n- **Row 3**: Remains 0|0|0|0.  \n**Total Score Gain**: 8 + 32 = 40.  \n**Alignment**: Larger tiles (32 in Row 0, Column 1; 32 in Row 2, Column 1) align vertically, potentially enabling future merges.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), and the two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). Result: 0|0|8|32.  \n- **Row 1**: No adjacent duplicates; tiles shift right but remain 16|2|8|4 (no score).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right (0|16|32|16) with no merges (no score).  \n- **Row 3**: Remains 0|0|0|0.  \n**Total Score Gain**: 8 + 32 = 40.  \n**Alignment**: 32 in Row 0, Column 3 and 32 in Row 2, Column 2 are misaligned, reducing future merge potential.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift up (4, 16, 16, 0). The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). Result: 4|32|0|0.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles shift up (4, 2, 32, 0) with no merges (no score).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles shift up (16, 8, 0, 0) with no merges (no score).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles shift up (16, 4, 16, 0) with no merges (no score).  \n**Total Score Gain**: 32.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift down (4, 16, 16, 0). The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). Result: 0|4|0|32.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles shift down (4, 2, 32, 0) with no merges (no score).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles shift down (16, 8, 0, 0) with no merges (no score).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles shift down (16, 4, 16, 0) with no merges (no score).  \n**Total Score Gain**: 32.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 40 points, but LEFT aligns larger tiles (32s) vertically, improving future merge potential. Thus, LEFT is optimal.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given game board. The goal is to maximize score through merges and strategically position larger tiles for future moves.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 32 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 16 | 2 | 8 | 4  \nRow 2: 16 | 32 | 16 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 4 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:  \nEach row shifts left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). No score gain. Tiles remain mostly in their original positions with empty spaces filled leftward.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:  \nEach row shifts right, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). No score gain. Tiles remain mostly in their original positions with empty spaces filled rightward.  \n\n#### **UP Swipe**:  \nColumns are processed top to bottom. In Column 0: [8, 16, 16, 0], the two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). Other columns have no merges. The resulting board has the merged 32 in Row 1, Column 0, with limited adjacency to other large tiles (32 in Row 0, Column 1).  \n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:  \nColumns are processed bottom to top. In Column 0: [8, 16, 16, 0], the two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). Additionally, after shifting, Row 3 becomes [32, 32, 4, 4] (from Column 0: 32, Column 1: 32, Column 2: 4, Column 3: 4). This positions two 32s and two 4s adjacently in the bottom row, creating opportunities for future merges (e.g., swiping left would merge the 32s into 64 and the 4s into 8).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe DOWN swipe merges two 16s (score +32) and strategically positions large tiles (32s and 4s) adjacently in the bottom row, setting up for future high-value merges. This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner and maximizing future moves.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the current game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|8|0  \nRow 1: 0|32|8|0  \nRow 2: 8|2|16|0  \nRow 3: 32|32|4|4  \n\n\n### **LEFT Move Analysis**  \nWhen swiping LEFT, tiles shift left, merging adjacent equal tiles:  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,8,0] → shifts to [8,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,32,8,0] → shifts to [32,8,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [8,2,16,0] → shifts to [8,2,16,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [32,32,4,4] → 32s merge into 64 (score +64), and 4s merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in [64,8,0,0].  \n\n**Resulting Board After LEFT**:  \nRow 0: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 32|8|0|0  \nRow 2: 8|2|16|0  \nRow 3: 64|8|0|0  \n\nThe largest tile (64) is placed in the bottom-left corner, a strategic position to avoid disruption and facilitate future merges.  \n\n\n### **RIGHT Move Analysis**  \nWhen swiping RIGHT, tiles shift right, merging adjacent equal tiles:  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,8,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,8] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,32,8,0] → shifts to [0,0,32,8] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [8,2,16,0] → shifts to [0,8,2,16] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [32,32,4,4] → 32s merge into 64 (score +64), and 4s merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in [0,0,64,8].  \n\n**Resulting Board After RIGHT**:  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 1: 0|0|32|8  \nRow 2: 0|8|2|16  \nRow 3: 0|0|64|8  \n\nThe largest tile (64) is placed in row 3, column 2, which is not a corner, making it more vulnerable to disruption.  \n\n\n### **UP Move Analysis**  \nWhen swiping UP, tiles shift up, merging adjacent equal tiles:  \n- **Column 0**: [0,0,8,32] → shifts to [8,32,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,32,2,32] → shifts to [32,2,32,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [8,8,16,4] → 8s merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in [16,16,4,0].  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,4] → shifts to [4,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n\n**Resulting Board After UP**:  \nRow 0: 8|32|16|4  \nRow 1: 32|2|16|0  \nRow 2: 0|32|4|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\nThe largest tile (32) is scattered, with no clear corner placement, reducing strategic potential.  \n\n\n### **DOWN Move Analysis**  \nWhen swiping DOWN, tiles shift down, merging adjacent equal tiles:  \n- **Column 0**: [0,0,8,32] → shifts to [0,0,8,32] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,32,2,32] → shifts to [0,32,2,32] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [8,8,16,4] → 8s merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in [0,16,16,4].  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,4] → shifts to [0,0,0,4] (no merges).  \n\n**Resulting Board After DOWN**:  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|32|16|0  \nRow 2: 8|2|16|0  \nRow 3: 32|32|4|4  \n\nNo significant merges occur in critical rows, and large tiles remain scattered.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe LEFT move merges the 32s and 4s in row 3, creating a 64 in the bottom-left corner (a strategic corner position). This setup minimizes disruption to large tiles and facilitates future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities and keep larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 0 | 0 | 4\nRow 1: 32 | 8 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 8 | 2 | 16 | 0\nRow 3: 64 | 8 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles in each row shift left. No merges occur immediately, but the resulting grid positions larger tiles (64, 32, 8) in the left column, aligning them vertically. This setup creates potential for future vertical merges (e.g., the two 8s in column 0 could merge with a subsequent DOWN swipe). The grid after a LEFT swipe would be:\n   ```\n   Row 0: 8 | 4 | 0 | 0\n   Row 1: 32 | 8 | 0 | 0\n   Row 2: 8 | 2 | 16 | 0\n   Row 3: 64 | 8 | 0 | 0\n   ```\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right, scattering larger tiles (64, 32, 16) across the grid. This reduces control over tile placement and limits future merging opportunities. The grid after a RIGHT swipe would be:\n   ```\n   Row 0: 0 | 0 | 8 | 4\n   Row 1: 0 | 0 | 32 | 8\n   Row 2: 0 | 8 | 2 | 16\n   Row 3: 0 | 0 | 64 | 8\n   ```\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift up, but no merges occur. Larger tiles (64, 32) remain in the left column, but smaller tiles (8, 2) are scattered in the top rows, reducing focus on a corner. The grid after an UP swipe would be:\n   ```\n   Row 0: 8 | 8 | 16 | 4\n   Row 1: 32 | 2 | 0 | 0\n   Row 2: 8 | 8 | 0 | 0\n   Row 3: 64 | 0 | 0 | 0\n   ```\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift down, with 16 and 4 moving to the bottom row. However, this scatters larger tiles (64, 16) horizontally, making it harder to merge them strategically. The grid after a DOWN swipe would be:\n   ```\n   Row 0: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0\n   Row 1: 32 | 8 | 0 | 0\n   Row 2: 8 | 2 | 0 | 0\n   Row 3: 64 | 8 | 16 | 4\n   ```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe is optimal because it consolidates larger tiles (64, 32, 8) in the left column, creating opportunities for future vertical merges (e.g., the two 8s in column 0 could merge with a subsequent DOWN swipe). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and maintaining control over tile placement.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down on the given 4x4 grid.

Result: [64,8,16,8].\n- **Key Outcome**: Row 0, Column 0 becomes 32, and Row 1, Column 0 remains 32 (stacked vertically, creating a future merge opportunity with UP). Larger tiles (64, 32) are positioned in corners (bottom-left and top-left), aligning with strategic goals.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [8,8,16,0] → Shift right, merge 8+8=16 (score +16), then merge 16+16=32 (score +32). Result: [0,0,0,32].\n- **Row 1**: [32,8,0,0] → Shift right (no merges). Result: [0,0,32,8].\n- **Row 2**: [8,2,0,0] → Shift right (no merges). Result: [0,0,8,2].\n- **Row 3**: [64,8,16,8] → Shift right (no merges). Result: [64,8,16,8].\n- **Key Outcome**: 32 is placed in the top-right corner, but no immediate future merges are set up, and larger tiles are less optimally positioned.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [8,32,8,64] → No merges. Result: [8,32,8,64].\n- **Column 1**: [8,8,2,8] → Merge 8+8=16 (score +16). Result: [16,2,8,0].\n- **Column 2**: [16,0,0,16] → Merge 16+16=32 (score +32). Result: [32,0,0,0].\n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,8] → Shift up. Result: [8,0,0,0].\n- **Key Outcome**: 32 is placed in the top-middle, with 16 and 8 in the top row. Larger tiles (64, 32) are not as effectively cornered.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [8,32,8,64] → No merges. Result: [8,32,8,64].\n- **Column 1**: [8,8,2,8] → Merge 8+8=16 (score +16). Result: [0,16,2,8].\n- **Column 2**: [16,0,0,16] → Merge 16+16=32 (score +32). Result: [0,0,0,32].\n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,8] → No change. Result: [0,0,0,8].\n- **Key Outcome**: 32 is placed in the bottom-middle, with 16 in the middle row. Larger tiles (64, 32) are not optimally aligned for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe **LEFT** swipe optimally merges tiles in Row 0 (8→16→32), positions 32 in the top-left corner (adjacent to the 32 in Row 1, Column 0 for future merging), and keeps the largest tile (64) in the bottom-left corner.

The merged `64` moves to Row 0, and the remaining tiles (`8` in Row 2, `64` in Row 3) shift up to Rows 1 and 2.  \n   - Other columns: No merges (e.g., Column 1: `2|8|2|8` → no adjacent equals).  \n   - Result: Larger tiles (e.g., `64` in Row 0) are placed in the top row, which is less strategic for future merging.\n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: `32` (Row 0) and `32` (Row 1) merge into `64` (score += 64). The merged `64` moves to Row 1, and the remaining tiles (`8` in Row 2, `64` in Row 3) stay in lower rows.  \n   - Other columns: No merges (e.g., Column 1: `2|8|2|8` → no adjacent equals).  \n   - Result: Larger tiles (e.g., `64` in Row 3, Column 0) remain in the bottom-left corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners for future merging.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe DOWN swipe preserves the largest tile (`64` in Row 3, Column 0) in the bottom-left corner, a strategic position for future merges. In contrast, the UP swipe moves a merged `64` to the top row, which is less ideal. Thus, DOWN is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 2 | 0 | 0\nRow 1: 64 | 8 | 0 | 32\nRow 2: 8 | 2 | 8 | 0\nRow 3: 64 | 8 | 16 | 8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: `[0, 2, 0, 0]` shifts to `[2, 0, 0, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: `[64, 8, 0, 32]` shifts to `[64, 8, 32, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: `[8, 2, 8, 0]` shifts to `[8, 2, 8, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: `[64, 8, 16, 8]` shifts to `[64, 8, 16, 8]` (no merges).  \n   - Result: No merges, but larger tiles (64s) remain in the left column, consolidating them in a corner.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: `[0, 2, 0, 0]` shifts to `[0, 0, 0, 2]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: `[64, 8, 0, 32]` shifts to `[0, 64, 8, 32]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: `[8, 2, 8, 0]` shifts to `[0, 8, 2, 8]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: `[64, 8, 16, 8]` shifts to `[64, 8, 16, 8]` (no merges).  \n   - Result: No merges, and larger tiles are scattered across columns, reducing strategic positioning.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: `[0, 64, 8, 64]` shifts to `[64, 8, 64, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: `[2, 8, 2, 8]` shifts to `[2, 8, 2, 8]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: `[0, 0, 8, 16]` shifts to `[8, 16, 0, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: `[0, 32, 0, 8]` shifts to `[32, 8, 0, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Result: No merges, and 64s are spread across rows 0 and 2, weakening corner consolidation.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: `[0, 64, 8, 64]` shifts to `[0, 64, 8, 64]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: `[2, 8, 2, 8]` shifts to `[2, 8, 2, 8]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: `[0, 0, 8, 16]` shifts to `[0, 0, 8, 16]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: `[0, 32, 0, 8]` shifts to `[0, 0, 32, 8]` (no merges).  \n   - Result: No merges, and 64s remain in rows 1 and 3 but do not consolidate further in the corner.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe key strategy is to keep larger tiles (e.g., 64s) in a corner for future merges.

This strategic positioning is better for long-term score growth.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate merges, score gains, and strategic positioning of tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 2 | 8 | 32 | 2  \nRow 1: 64 | 2 | 16 | 8  \nRow 2: 64 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 64 | 16 | 16 | 0  \n\n\n### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: No merges (tiles: 2, 8, 32, 2).  \n- **Row 1**: No merges (tiles: 64, 2, 16, 8).  \n- **Row 2**: No merges (tile: 64, 0, 0, 0).  \n- **Row 3**: Merges 16 + 16 = 32 (score +32). New row: 64, 32, 0, 0.  \n- **Total Score Gain**: 32.  \n\n\n### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: No merges (tiles: 2, 8, 32, 2).  \n- **Row 1**: No merges (tiles: 64, 2, 16, 8).  \n- **Row 2**: Shifts 64 to the right (row becomes: 0, 0, 0, 64).  \n- **Row 3**: Merges 16 + 16 = 32 (score +32). New row: 0, 64, 32, 0.  \n- **Total Score Gain**: 32.  \n\n\n### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: Merges 64 (Row 1) + 64 (Row 2) = 128 (score +128). New column: 2, 128, 64, 0.  \n- **Column 1**: No merges (tiles: 8, 2, 16, 0).  \n- **Column 2**: Merges 16 (Row 1) + 16 (Row 3) = 32 (score +32). New column: 32, 32, 0, 0.  \n- **Column 3**: No merges (tiles: 2, 8, 0, 0).  \n- **Total Score Gain**: 128 + 32 = 160.  \n\n\n### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: Merges 64 (Row 2) + 64 (Row 3) = 128 (score +128). New column: 0, 2, 64, 128 (128 in bottom-left corner).  \n- **Column 1**: No merges (tiles: 0, 8, 2, 16).  \n- **Column 2**: Merges 16 (Row 1) + 16 (Row 3) = 32 (score +32). New column: 0, 0, 32, 32.  \n- **Column 3**: No merges (tiles: 0, 0, 2, 8).  \n- **Total Score Gain**: 128 + 32 = 160.  \n\n\n### Strategic Evaluation:\nBoth UP and DOWN yield the highest score gain (160). However, DOWN places the merged 128 tile in the **bottom-left corner** (Row 3, Column 0), which aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners for better future merging opportunities. This corner positioning reduces the risk of blocking larger tiles and facilitates controlled merging of smaller tiles.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|32|0|0\nRow 1: 2|8|0|0\nRow 2: 64|2|32|2\nRow 3: 128|16|32|8\n```\n\n### LEFT and RIGHT Moves:\n- **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur.  \n- **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right, but again, no adjacent equal tiles in any row. No merges occur.  \n\n### UP Move:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles [0, 2, 64, 128] shift up to [2, 64, 128, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles [32, 8, 2, 16] remain (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles [0, 0, 32, 32] shift up, merge into 64 (score +64), resulting in [64, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles [0, 0, 2, 8] shift up to [2, 8, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: Merges occur, but the 128 tile (originally in row 3, column 0) moves up to row 2, weakening its corner position.  \n\n### DOWN Move:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles [0, 2, 64, 128] remain (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles [32, 8, 2, 16] remain (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles [0, 0, 32, 32] shift down, merge into 64 (score +64), resulting in [0, 0, 0, 64].  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles [0, 0, 2, 8] remain (no merges).  \n- **Result**: Merges occur, and the 128 tile stays in the bottom-left corner (row 3, column 0), a strategic position.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and DOWN merge two 32s into 64 (score +64). However, DOWN preserves the 128 tile in the bottom-left corner, which aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners. This positioning is better for future merges and game longevity.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|32|0|0\nRow 1: 2|8|0|64\nRow 2: 64|2|0|2\nRow 3: 128|16|64|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \nEach row is processed to shift tiles left, merging adjacent equal tiles:  \n- **Row 0**: [0, 32, 0, 0] → Shifts to [32, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [2, 8, 0, 64] → Shifts to [2, 8, 64, 0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [64, 2, 0, 2] → Shifts to [64, 2, 2, 0], then merges the two 2s into 4 → [64, 4, 0, 0] (score +4).  \n- **Row 3**: [128, 16, 64, 8] → All distinct, no merges → [128, 16, 64, 8].  \n\nResulting board after LEFT (before new tile):  \n```\n32|0|0|0  \n2|8|64|0  \n64|4|0|0  \n128|16|64|8  \n```  \nThis move consolidates the left column (32, 64, 128) and merges 2s into 4, maintaining larger tiles in the corner.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nEach row is processed to shift tiles right, merging adjacent equal tiles:  \n- **Row 0**: [0, 32, 0, 0] → Shifts to [0, 0, 0, 32] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [2, 8, 0, 64] → Shifts to [0, 2, 8, 64] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [64, 2, 0, 2] → Shifts to [64, 0, 2, 2], then merges the two 2s into 4 → [0, 64, 0, 4] (score +4).  \n- **Row 3**: [128, 16, 64, 8] → All distinct, no merges → [128, 16, 64, 8].  \n\nResulting board after RIGHT (before new tile):  \n```\n0|0|0|32  \n0|2|8|64  \n0|64|0|4  \n128|16|64|8  \n```  \nThis move scatters larger tiles (32, 64) across the right, which is less strategic for corner consolidation.\n\n#### **UP**  \nColumns are processed to shift tiles up, with no merges:  \n- **Column 0**: [0, 2, 64, 128] → Shifts to [2, 64, 128, 0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 1**: [32, 8, 2, 16] → All distinct → [32, 8, 2, 16] (no merge).  \n- **Column 2**: [0, 0, 0, 64] → Shifts to [64, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [0, 64, 2, 8] → Shifts to [64, 2, 8, 0] (no merge).  \n\nNo merges occur, making this move less beneficial.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \nColumns are processed to shift tiles down, with no merges:  \n- **Column 0**: [0, 2, 64, 128] → Shifts to [0, 2, 64, 128] (no merge).  \n- **Column 1**: [32, 8, 2, 16] → All distinct → [32, 8, 2, 16] (no merge).  \n- **Column 2**: [0, 0, 0, 64] → Shifts to [0, 0, 0, 64] (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [0, 64, 2, 8] → Shifts to [0, 64, 2, 8] (no merge).  \n\nNo merges occur, making this move less beneficial.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT is optimal as it consolidates larger tiles (128, 64, 32) in the left column, merges 2s into 4 for score, and aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### **Game Board Analysis**  \nCurrent board:  \nRow 0: 32|32|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|8|64|0  \nRow 2: 64|4|0|0  \nRow 3: 128|16|64|8  \n\n### **LEFT Move**  \n- Row 0: 32 and 32 merge into 64 (score +64). Result: 64|0|0|0.  \n- Other rows (1-3) have no merges (non-adjacent or distinct values).  \n- New tiles will fill empty spaces, but no strategic advantage for large tiles.  \n\n### **RIGHT Move**  \n- Row 0: 32 and 32 merge into 64 (score +64).

However, LEFT aligns the merged 64 with the existing 64 in Row 2, Column 0, creating opportunities for future vertical merges. This strategic alignment of larger tiles in the left column is preferable for long-term progression.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to identify a move that facilitates future merges and strategically positions larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 64|0|0|0\nRow 1: 2|8|0|32\nRow 2: 64|4|16|0\nRow 3: 128|16|128|8\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Larger Tiles**: The largest tiles are 128 (row 3, columns 0 and 2) and 64 (row 0, column 0; row 2, column 0).\n- **Potential Merges**: The two 64s in column 0 (row 0 and row 2) are separated by a 2 (row 1, column 0). If the 2 can be moved out of column 0, the 64s could merge. Similarly, the two 128s in row 3 (columns 0 and 2) are separated by a 16 (row 3, column 1), which could be moved to enable merging.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n   - Row 1 becomes `2|8|32|0`, row 2 becomes `64|4|16|0`, and other rows remain mostly unchanged.  \n   - No meaningful progress toward merging larger tiles.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, filling empty spaces.  \n   - Row 0: `0|0|0|64` (64 moves to the rightmost column).  \n   - Row 1: `0|2|8|32` (2, 8, 32 shift right).  \n   - Row 2: `0|64|4|16` (64, 4, 16 shift right).  \n   - Row 3 remains `128|16|128|8` (no zeros to shift into).  \n   - **Critical Outcome**: The 2 in row 1, column 0 moves to row 1, column 1, clearing column 0, row 1. This positions the two 64s in column 0 (row 0 and row 2) to be adjacent if followed by an UP swipe, enabling a merge into 128.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift up, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n   - Column 1: `8|4|16|0` (8, 4, 16 shift up).  \n   - Column 2: `16|128|0|0` (16, 128 shift up).  \n   - Column 3: `32|8|0|0` (32, 8 shift up).  \n   - Does not meaningfully position larger tiles for future merges.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift down, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n   - Minimal movement (only column 3 shifts partially).  \n   - No progress toward merging larger tiles.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe RIGHT swipe is the best move. It shifts the 2 in row 1, column 0 to row 1, column 1, clearing column 0, row 1. This positions the two 64s in column 0 (row 0 and row 2) to be adjacent in subsequent moves (e.g., an UP swipe), enabling a critical merge into 128. This strategic positioning aligns with the goal of combining larger tiles to maximize scores.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile alignment.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 64  \nRow 1: 16 | 2 | 8 | 32  \nRow 2: 0 | 64 | 4 | 16  \nRow 3: 128 | 16 | 128 | 8  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - No tiles merge in any row. All rows are already shifted right (no empty spaces to fill).  \n   - No new merging opportunities. Poor for future strategy.\n\n2. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed upward. Tiles shift but no merges occur (e.g., column 0: [0, 16, 0, 128] → [16, 128, 0, 0]; column 1: [0, 2, 64, 16] → [2, 64, 16, 0]).  \n   - No merges, and larger tiles (e.g., 128) are scattered, not consolidated.\n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed downward. Tiles shift but no merges occur (e.g., column 0: [0, 16, 0, 128] → [0, 0, 16, 128]; column 1: [0, 2, 64, 16] → [0, 2, 64, 16]).  \n   - No merges, and tile alignment remains suboptimal.\n\n4. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: [0, 0, 0, 64] → [64, 0, 0, 0] (64 shifts left to column 0).  \n   - **Row 1**: [16, 2, 8, 32] → No shift (all non-zero, no merges).  \n   - **Row 2**: [0, 64, 4, 16] → [64, 4, 16, 0] (64, 4, 16 shift left).  \n   - **Row 3**: [128, 16, 128, 8] → No shift (all non-zero, no merges).  \n   - **Key Outcome**: 64s in Row 0 (column 0) and Row 2 (column 0) align vertically, separated by a 16 in Row 1 (column 0). This positions larger tiles (64, 128) toward the left, a corner, which aligns with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in corners for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT swipe optimally aligns tiles (e.g., 64s in column 0) and positions larger tiles in a corner, setting up for potential future merges. Other directions fail to create meaningful alignment or merging opportunities.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 64|0|0|0\nRow 1: 16|2|8|32\nRow 2: 64|4|16|2\nRow 3: 128|16|128|8\n```\nKey observations:\n- Empty tiles (0s) are only in Row 0, columns 1-3.\n- No adjacent tiles with the same value exist, so valid moves depend on tiles moving into empty spaces.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### LEFT:\n- All tiles are already shifted left in their rows (no empty spaces to the left of tiles). No movement or merging occurs. **Invalid move**.\n\n#### RIGHT:\n- Only Row 0 has empty spaces to the right. The 64 in Row 0, column 0 shifts right to Row 0, column 3. Other rows have no empty spaces to the right of their tiles. While valid, this move only affects one tile and leaves larger tiles (128s) scattered.\n\n#### DOWN:\n- No empty spaces exist below tiles in Rows 1-3 (since they are already in the bottom three rows). Tiles cannot move down. **Invalid move**.\n\n#### UP:\n- Columns 1-3 have empty spaces in Row 0. Tiles in these columns (Rows 1-3) shift upward into Row 0:\n  - Column 1: 2 (Row 1) → Row 0, 4 (Row 2) → Row 1, 16 (Row 3) → Row 2.\n  - Column 2: 8 (Row 1) → Row 0, 16 (Row 2) → Row 1, 128 (Row 3) → Row 2.\n  - Column 3: 32 (Row 1) → Row 0, 2 (Row 2) → Row 1, 8 (Row 3) → Row 2.\n- This results in:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 64|2|8|32\n  Row 1: 16|4|16|2\n  Row 2: 64|16|128|8\n  Row 3: 128|0|0|0\n  ```\n- Larger tiles (64 in Row 0, column 0; 128 in Row 3, column 0) remain in corners, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners for future merges. This move also creates more opportunities for future tile movement and merging by shifting smaller tiles upward.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move, as it shifts tiles into empty spaces, maintains large tiles in corners, and sets up potential future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and the goal of maximizing merges and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\n64|2|8|32\n16|4|16|2\n64|16|128|8\n128|0|2|0\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Rows 1-3 have no adjacent duplicates, so tiles do not merge.  \n   - Row 4 (128|0|2|0) shifts left to 128|2|0|0. No merges occur.  \n   - Result: No meaningful merges or strategic improvements.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Rows 1-3 have no adjacent duplicates, so tiles do not merge.  \n   - Row 4 (128|0|2|0) shifts right to 0|0|128|2.  \n   - **Key Insight**: After shifting right, column 3 (originally 8|16|128|2) becomes 8|16|128|128 (since row 4, column 3 now holds 128 from row 4, column 1). This sets up a vertical pair of 128s in column 3 (rows 3 and 4).  \n   - Future Potential: In the next move, swiping UP would merge these 128s into 256, yielding a high score.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns 1-4 have no adjacent duplicates, so tiles do not merge.  \n   - The board remains unchanged (no tiles shift or merge).  \n   - Result: Invalid move (no tiles move or merge).\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns 1-4 have no adjacent duplicates, so tiles do not merge.  \n   - Tiles shift down, but no meaningful merges or strategic improvements occur.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT shifts the 128 in row 4, column 1 to row 4, column 3, creating a vertical pair of 128s in column 3. This sets up a high-value merge (128 + 128 = 256) in the next move, making RIGHT the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate potential merges, score gains, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### **LEFT Move**  \nProcessing each row leftward:  \n- Row 0: [64, 2, 8, 32] (no merges, all distinct).  \n- Row 1: [16, 4, 16, 2] (no merges, 16s are not adjacent after shifting).  \n- Row 2: [64, 16, 128, 8] (no merges, all distinct).  \n- Row 3: [0, 4, 128, 2] (shifts to [4, 128, 2, 0], no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges. Score gain: 0.  \n\n\n### **RIGHT Move**  \nProcessing each row rightward:  \n- Row 0: [64, 2, 8, 32] (no merges, all distinct).  \n- Row 1: [16, 4, 16, 2] (16s merge into 32 after shifting right; row becomes [0, 32, 4, 2]).  \n- Row 2: [64, 16, 128, 8] (no merges, all distinct).  \n- Row 3: [0, 4, 128, 2] (shifts to [2, 4, 128, 0], no merges).  \n**Result**: One merge (16+16=32). Score gain: 32.  \n\n\n### **UP Move**  \nProcessing each column upward:  \n- Column 0: [64, 16, 64, 0] (no merges, 64s are not adjacent).  \n- Column 1: [2, 4, 16, 4] (no merges, 4s are not adjacent).  \n- Column 2: [8, 16, 128, 128] (128s merge into 256 after shifting up; column becomes [8, 16, 256, 0]).  \n- Column 3: [32, 2, 8, 2] (no merges, 2s are not adjacent).  \n**Result**: One merge (128+128=256). Score gain: 256.  \n\n\n### **DOWN Move**  \nProcessing each column downward:  \n- Column 0: [64, 16, 64, 0] (no merges, 64s are not adjacent).  \n- Column 1: [2, 4, 16, 4] (no merges, 4s are not adjacent).  \n- Column 2: [8, 16, 128, 128] (128s merge into 256 after shifting down; column becomes [0, 8, 16, 256]).  \n- Column 3: [32, 2, 8, 2] (no merges, 2s are not adjacent).  \n**Result**: One merge (128+128=256). Score gain: 256.  \n\n\n### **Strategy Evaluation**  \nBoth UP and DOWN yield the highest score gain (256). However, strategic positioning of the 256 tile is critical. The UP move places the 256 in row 2, column 2 (center), while the DOWN move places it in row 3, column 2 (bottom-middle). Keeping larger tiles in a corner is ideal, but neither position is a corner. However, the UP move retains the 256 in a row with smaller tiles (64, 16, 8), which may allow more flexibility for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score through tile merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 8 | 32\nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 16 | 2\nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 256 | 8\nRow 3: 0 | 4 | 64 | 2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- All rows have distinct or non-adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur. The board remains unchanged except for row 3 (shifting `[0,4,64,2]` to `[4,64,2,0]`). No score gain.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Tiles in all rows are non-adjacent and distinct. No merges occur. The board remains unchanged. No score gain.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed to shift tiles downward. No adjacent equal tiles are found in any column after shifting. No merges occur. The board remains unchanged. No score gain.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed to shift tiles upward. Key observation: **Column 0** has `64` (row 0), `16` (row 1), `64` (row 2), and `0` (row 3). When shifting up:\n  - `64` (row 2) moves upward past `16` (row 1) to row 1, making the column `[64, 64, 16, 0]`.\n  - The two `64`s in row 0 and row 1 are now adjacent and merge into `128`, yielding 128 points.\n  - The `16` (row 2) shifts upward to row 1, resulting in column 0: `[128, 16, 0, 0]`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe merges the two `64`s in column 0 into `128`, providing the highest immediate score gain and strategically consolidating larger tiles.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles. The current game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 8 | 32  \nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 64 | 2  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No Empty Tiles**: All tiles are occupied (no zeros), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **Adjacent Tiles**: No two adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. For example:\n  - Row 1 has 16s in columns 0 and 2, but they are separated by a 4.\n  - Column 0 has 64s in rows 0 and 2, and 16s in rows 1 and 3, but they are not adjacent.\n  - Column 1 has 4s in rows 1 and 3, separated by a 16.\n  - Column 3 has 2s in rows 1 and 3, separated by an 8.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipes**: In all rows, tiles are already packed with no gaps, and no adjacent equal values. Swiping left or right would not shift or merge any tiles.\n- **UP\/DOWN Swipes**: In all columns, tiles are fully packed with no gaps, and no adjacent equal values. Swiping up or down would not shift or merge any tiles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, all moves are technically invalid under the rules (no valid merges or empty spaces to shift into). However, the problem requires selecting a direction, and strategic conventions (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners) suggest prioritizing moves that might set up future merges. Given the 256 tile is in row 2, column 2, a **LEFT** swipe minimally disrupts this corner, making it the most neutral choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize the score and set up for future moves by strategically merging tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 8 | 32  \nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 64 | 2  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: 64, 2, 8, 32 (all distinct; no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: 16, 4, 16, 2 → shifts to 16, 16, 4, 2 (merges 16 + 16 = 32; score +32).  \n- **Row 2**: 64, 16, 256, 8 (all distinct; no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: 16, 4, 64, 2 (all distinct; no merges).  \n**Total Score**: 32.  \n\n\n#### 2. RIGHT Swipe:\n- All rows have distinct or non-adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and no tiles shift (since the grid is full).  \n**Total Score**: 0 (invalid move).  \n\n\n#### 3. UP Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: 64, 16, 64, 16 → shifts to 64, 64, 16, 16 (merges 64 + 64 = 128; score +128) and 16 + 16 = 32 (score +32).  \n- **Column 1**: 2, 4, 16, 4 (all distinct; no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: 8, 16, 256, 64 (all distinct; no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: 32, 2, 8, 2 (all distinct; no merges).  \n**Total Score**: 128 + 32 = 160.  \n\n\n#### 4. DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: 64, 16, 64, 16 (all distinct; no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: 2, 4, 16, 4 (all distinct; no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: 8, 16, 256, 64 (all distinct; no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: 32, 2, 8, 2 → shifts to 32, 8, 2, 2 (merges 2 + 2 = 4; score +4).  \n**Total Score**: 4.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe yields the highest score (160) by merging 64s and 16s in Column 0, making it the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic placement of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 8 | 32  \nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 64 | 2  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The grid is full (no empty tiles, 0s). Valid moves require either merging adjacent tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend on merging adjacent or shiftable tiles.\n- The largest tile is 256 (row 2, column 2). Strategic play involves keeping large tiles in corners to facilitate merging smaller tiles toward them.\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   - Rows have no adjacent equal tiles (e.g., row 0: 64, 2, 8, 32; row 1: 16, 4, 16, 2). Swiping left\/right would not merge any tiles, as tiles cannot shift (grid is full). These directions are invalid.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - **Column 0 (64, 16, 64, 16)**: Tiles shift up, merging 64s (row 0 and row 1) into 128, and 16s (row 2 and row 3) into 32. Result: [128, 32, 0, 0].  \n   - **Column 1 (2, 4, 16, 4)**: Tiles shift up, merging 4s (row 1 and row 2) into 8. Result: [2, 8, 16, 0].  \n   - **Column 2 (8, 16, 256, 64)**: No merges (all tiles differ).  \n   - **Column 3 (32, 2, 8, 2)**: Tiles shift up, merging 2s (row 0 and row 1) into 4. Result: [4, 8, 32, 0].  \n   - **Outcome**: Merges 64s, 16s, 4s, and 2s, with 128 (merged) in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and 256 preserved in row 2, column 2.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - **Column 0 (64, 16, 64, 16)**: Tiles shift down, merging 16s (row 0 and row 1) into 32, and 64s (row 2 and row 3) into 128. Result: [0, 0, 32, 128].  \n   - **Column 1 (2, 4, 16, 4)**: Tiles shift down, merging 4s (row 1 and row 2) into 8. Result: [0, 2, 8, 16].  \n   - **Column 2 (8, 16, 256, 64)**: No merges.  \n   - **Column 3 (32, 2, 8, 2)**: Tiles shift down, merging 2s (row 1 and row 2) into 4. Result: [0, 32, 4, 8].  \n   - **Outcome**: Merges occur, but 128 is placed in the bottom-left corner, which is less strategic than keeping it in the top-left (UP direction).\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move. It merges multiple tiles (64s, 16s, 4s, 2s), increases the score, and positions the merged 128 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), aligning with the goal of keeping larger tiles in corners for future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile movement.\n\n### Game Board State:\nThe current board has no empty tiles (all 16 tiles are non-zero). Each tile is a distinct power of 2, and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. This means no merges are possible in any direction. \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Since all tiles are non-zero and no adjacent tiles are equal, shifting left or right will not change the board (no merges or movement possible).  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: Similarly, vertical shifts will not alter the board, as there are no empty spaces to move into and no adjacent equal tiles to merge.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no valid moves (merges or tile shifts into empty spaces) are possible. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we assume the intended answer is based on strategic positioning, even if no immediate merges occur.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging and movement potential.

Thus, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the answer defaults to the most strategically neutral option. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement. The current board has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value to merge.

No adjacent tiles in any row are equal (e.g., Row 1: 16, 4, 16, 2—16s are separated by 4; Row 0: 64, 2, 8, 32—all distinct). No merges occur.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   Each row is processed right to left. Similarly, no adjacent tiles in any row are equal (e.g., Row 1 reversed: 2, 16, 4, 16—no merges; Row 0 reversed: 32, 8, 2, 64—all distinct). No merges occur.  \n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   Each column is processed top to bottom.

Columns still have no adjacent equal tiles (e.g., Column 1 reversed: 4, 16, 4, 2—4s are separated by 16; Column 0 reversed: 16, 64, 16, 64—16s and 64s are separated by other values). No merges occur.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves fail to merge tiles since no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) are equal, and the grid is full (no empty spaces to shift tiles into).

The current board has no empty tiles (all 16 tiles are occupied), so valid moves depend on whether adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) can merge.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 8 | 32  \nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 64 | 2  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: All rows are fully occupied with no zeros. For merging, adjacent tiles in a row must be equal. In Row 1, the 16s are separated by a 4 (not adjacent), so no merges. Other rows have distinct values. No valid merges.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Similar to LEFT, all rows are full with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges.  \n3. **UP**: All columns are fully occupied. Checking columns for adjacent equal tiles:  \n   - Column 0: 64, 16, 64, 16 (no adjacent equals).  \n   - Column 1: 2, 4, 16, 4 (no adjacent equals).  \n   - Column 2: 8, 16, 256, 64 (all distinct).  \n   - Column 3: 32, 2, 8, 2 (no adjacent equals).  \n   No valid merges.  \n4. **DOWN**: Identical to UP. Columns are full with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is completely full, and there are no adjacent equal tiles in any direction.

No merges occur. Score gain: 0.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Move**  \nAll rows have distinct adjacent tiles when shifted right. No merges occur. Score gain: 0.  \n\n#### **UP Move**  \nColumns are processed from top to bottom. Key merges occur in **Column 0**:  \n- Column 0: [64, 16, 64, 16]. When shifted up, tiles become [64, 64, 16, 16].  \n  - 64 + 64 merges into 128 (score +128).  \n  - 16 + 16 merges into 32 (score +32).  \nOther columns (1, 2, 3) have no merges.

Sliding left results in no merges or score gain.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- All rows have distinct tiles with no adjacent duplicates. Sliding right results in no merges or score gain.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are checked for vertical merges. No columns have adjacent duplicates that can merge when sliding up. For example:  \n  - Column 0: [64, 16, 64, 16] has 64s and 16s separated by other tiles, so no merges.  \n  - Other columns also lack merges.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are checked for vertical merges. Column 0 ([64, 16, 64, 16]) has critical merges when sliding down:  \n  - **Column 0 Analysis**:  \n    - The 64 in Row 0 and 64 in Row 2 are separated by 16 (Row 1). When sliding down, the 64 in Row 0 moves past the 16 (Row 1) to Row 2, merging with the 64 in Row 2 to form 128 (score +128).  \n    - The 16 in Row 1 moves past the now-empty Row 0 to Row 3, merging with the 16 in Row 3 to form 32 (score +32).  \n  - Other columns (1, 2, 3) have no merges, but Column 0 alone provides significant score.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving **DOWN** triggers merges in Column 0, resulting in a total score gain of 160 (128 + 32). This is the only move that generates merges and maximizes the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on 2048 mechanics, where tiles shift toward the direction, merge adjacent equal tiles once per move, and create empty spaces.

The two 16s merge into 32, creating [32, 4, 2, 0] (with a new empty space).  \n- **Row 2**: [64, 16, 256, 8] – All distinct, no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: [16, 4, 64, 2] – All distinct, no merges.  \n\nThis move merges two 16s in Row 1, generating a 32 tile and an empty space. It is valid and beneficial.\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- All rows have distinct tiles. Shifting right does not merge any tiles, and the board remains unchanged. No valid merges or empty spaces created.  \n\n#### **UP Move**:\n- Columns are checked for merges. All columns have distinct tiles, so no merges occur. The board remains unchanged.  \n\n#### **DOWN Move**:\n- Columns are checked for merges. All columns have distinct tiles, so no merges occur. The board remains unchanged.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT move is the only direction that results in a merge (16 + 16 = 32) and creates an empty space, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same value. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 1: 64|2|8|32  \nRow 2: 16|4|16|2  \nRow 3: 64|16|256|8  \nRow 4: 16|4|64|2  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Each row is checked for adjacent merges. All rows have distinct values with no adjacent duplicates. For example, Row 2 has `16|4|16|2`—the two 16s are separated by 4 and cannot merge. No merges occur, and tiles do not shift (no empty spaces).  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Similar to LEFT, all rows have distinct values with no adjacent duplicates. For example, Row 2 remains `16|4|16|2` when shifted right, as no merges are possible. Tiles do not shift.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Each column is checked for vertical merges. Columns have no adjacent duplicates. For example, Column 1 (`64|16|64|16`) has 64s and 16s separated by other values, preventing merges. Tiles do not shift.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Columns are checked for vertical merges. Column 4 (`32|2|8|2`) has 2s in Row 2 and Row 4, but they are separated by 8 and cannot merge. Column 2 (`2|4|16|4`) has 4s in Row 2 and Row 4, separated by 16, so no merge. Tiles do not shift.  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The grid is full (no 0s), and no adjacent tiles have the same value. Thus, no merges occur in any direction.  \n- All moves are technically \"valid\" under the rules (since the game continues until no valid moves exist or epoch 100), but none result in immediate merges or tile shifts.  \n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nThe largest tile (256) is in Row 3, Column 3. To maintain strategic positioning, moving DOWN keeps larger tiles in lower rows, aligning with the goal of consolidating larger tiles in corners for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 8 | 32\nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 16 | 2\nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 256 | 8\nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 64 | 2\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The grid is **full** (no empty tiles, 0s), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- No adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value, meaning no immediate merges are possible in any direction. However, we must still choose a direction as per the problem constraints.\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **LEFT**: All rows are checked for leftward shifts. No merges occur as no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. Tiles remain in their positions.\n2. **RIGHT**: All rows are checked for rightward shifts. No merges occur as no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. Tiles remain in their positions.\n3. **UP**: All columns are checked for upward shifts. No merges occur as no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. Tiles remain in their positions.\n4. **DOWN**: All columns are checked for downward shifts. No merges occur as no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. Tiles remain in their positions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full with no adjacent equal tiles, no valid merges exist. However, the problem requires selecting a direction. Given the lack of merges, any direction is technically valid (as the game does not end until epoch 100). A common strategy is to prioritize keeping large tiles (e.g., 256) in a corner, and moving DOWN may help maintain this structure.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. The grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles, 0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number to merge. \n\n### Game Board:\n```\n64|2|8|32\n16|4|16|2\n64|16|256|8\n16|4|64|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: All rows are fully occupied with distinct adjacent tiles (no duplicates). No merges or shifts occur. Invalid.  \n2. **RIGHT**: All rows are fully occupied with distinct adjacent tiles (no duplicates). No merges or shifts occur. Invalid.  \n3. **UP**: All columns are fully occupied with distinct adjacent tiles (no duplicates). No merges or shifts occur. Invalid.  \n4. **DOWN**: All columns are fully occupied with distinct adjacent tiles (no duplicates). No merges or shifts occur. Invalid.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same number. Thus, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and no direction leads to a valid merge or shift, the game would end, but the forced choice must be made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. The goal is to identify a move that merges tiles (to gain score) or creates opportunities for future merges. The current grid is:\n\n```\n64|2|8|32\n16|4|16|2\n64|16|256|8\n16|4|64|2\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Grid is Full**: All 16 tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces).\n- **No Adjacent Same Tiles**: Checking all horizontal and vertical adjacent pairs confirms no two adjacent tiles have the same value. For example:\n  - Row 2 has \"16|4|16|2\" (16s are separated by 4, not adjacent).\n  - Column 1 has \"64|16|64|16\" (64s and 16s are separated by other values, not adjacent).\n  - All other rows and columns similarly lack adjacent duplicates.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are the same, shifting left or right will not merge any tiles. Tiles remain in their original positions.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Similarly, shifting up or down will not merge any tiles. All columns are full, and no adjacent vertical tiles are the same. Tiles remain in their original positions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are invalid because there are no adjacent same tiles to merge and no empty spaces to shift tiles into. However, since the problem requires selecting a direction, any direction is technically acceptable (though no merges or shifts occur).\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid, focusing on merging tiles and creating valid moves. The grid has no empty spaces (0s), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same number.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64|2|8|32\nRow 1: 16|4|16|2\nRow 2: 64|16|256|8\nRow 3: 16|4|64|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 1: [16, 4, 16, 2] can shift left, merging the two 16s into 32 (score +32). Other rows have no merges.  \n   - Result: Limited merging (only one pair).  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - No adjacent tiles in any row can merge when shifted right. All rows remain unchanged. Invalid move.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - **Column 0**: [64, 16, 64, 16] shifts up, merging the two 64s into 128 (score +128).  \n   - **Column 1**: [2, 4, 16, 4] shifts up, merging the two 4s into 8 (score +8).  \n   - **Column 3**: [32, 2, 8, 2] shifts up, merging the two 2s into 4 (score +4).  \n   - Result: Multiple merges (three pairs), maximizing score.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - No adjacent tiles in any column can merge when shifted down. All columns remain unchanged. Invalid move.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP move allows merging three pairs of tiles (64s, 4s, and 2s), resulting in the highest score gain. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile placement. The current game board is:\n\n```\n64|2|8|32\n16|4|16|2\n64|16|256|8\n16|4|64|2\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid Status**: All tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n2. **Horizontal Merges**:  \n   - Row 0: `64|2|8|32` (all distinct).  \n   - Row 1: `16|4|16|2` (16s are separated by 4, no adjacency).  \n   - Row 2: `64|16|256|8` (all distinct).  \n   - Row 3: `16|4|64|2` (all distinct).  \n   No horizontal merges are possible.  \n\n3. **Vertical Merges**:  \n   - Column 0: `64|16|64|16` (64s and 16s are separated by one tile, no adjacency).  \n   - Column 1: `2|4|16|4` (4s are separated by 16, no adjacency).  \n   - Column 2: `8|16|256|64` (all distinct).  \n   - Column 3: `32|2|8|2` (2s are separated by 8, no adjacency).  \n   No vertical merges are possible.  \n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: No tiles can merge horizontally, and all tiles are already fully shifted (no empty spaces to fill).  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: No tiles can merge vertically, and all tiles are already fully shifted (no empty spaces to fill).  \n\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of merges, any direction is technically invalid, but LEFT is chosen as a default.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement. The goal is to identify a move that maximizes future merging potential while preserving larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 8 | 32  \nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 64 | 2  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- All rows are full (no zeros), and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. Shifting left will not merge any tiles. The board remains unchanged.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Similarly, all rows are full, and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. Shifting right will not merge any tiles. The board remains unchanged.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- All columns are full (no zeros), and no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. Shifting up will not merge any tiles. The board remains unchanged.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- All columns are full, but the 256 tile (largest tile) is in the center (row 2, column 2). Shifting down preserves the 256 tile’s position while potentially aligning smaller tiles for future merges. For example, the 2s in column 3 (row 1 and row 3) could eventually align if shifted down repeatedly. While no immediate merges occur, this move strategically positions tiles to avoid disrupting the 256 tile, keeping it in a stable position for future moves.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhile no immediate merges are possible in any direction, moving **DOWN** is the most strategic choice to preserve the 256 tile and set up potential future merges.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning.

For example:\n   - Rows: No two adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., Row 1: 16, 4, 16, 2—16s are separated by 4 and do not merge when shifted left\/right).\n   - Columns: No two adjacent tiles in any column are the same (e.g., Column 0: 64, 16, 64, 16—64s and 16s are separated by other values and do not merge when shifted up\/down).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipes**: Tiles shift horizontally but cannot merge (no adjacent equal values).  \n- **UP\/DOWN Swipes**: Tiles shift vertically but cannot merge (no adjacent equal values).  \n\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, there are no valid moves.

No adjacent tiles in any column are equal (e.g., Column 0: 64, 16, 64, 16; Column 1: 2, 4, 16, 4). No merges occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Columns are reversed and processed as UP swipes (equivalent to DOWN swipes). No adjacent tiles in any column are equal. No merges occur.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nAll directions result in no merges, as there are no adjacent tiles of the same value in any row or column. Since the grid is full and no valid merges are possible, any move is technically invalid. However, following strategic guidelines (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners), no direction disrupts the current arrangement more than others.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning.

For example:\n   - Row 0: 64, 2, 8, 32 (all distinct).\n   - Row 1: 16, 4, 16, 2 (16s are separated by 4, not adjacent).\n   - Row 2: 64, 16, 256, 8 (all distinct).\n   - Row 3: 16, 4, 64, 2 (all distinct).\n   - Columns also show no adjacent duplicates (e.g., column 0: 64, 16, 64, 16; 64s are separated by 16s).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Tiles in each row are already shifted to the edges (no empty spaces to shift into), and no adjacent duplicates exist to merge. No merges or shifts occur.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Tiles in each column are already shifted to the top\/bottom (no empty spaces to shift into), and no adjacent duplicates exist to merge. No merges or shifts occur.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full (no empty tiles) and no adjacent tiles are identical, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.

However, per the problem constraints, the answer must be one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid moves, the choice is arbitrary, but LEFT is selected as a default.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and the game rules. The grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles, 0s), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 8 | 32\nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 16 | 2\nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 256 | 8\nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 64 | 2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Each row is processed left to right. All rows have distinct values with no adjacent duplicates. For example:  \n   - Row 1: `16, 4, 16, 2` has non-adjacent 16s (separated by 4), so no merge.  \n   No merges occur in any row. **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Each row is processed right to left.

For example:  \n   - Column 0: `64, 16, 64, 16` has non-adjacent 64s and 16s (separated by other values), so no merge.  \n   No merges occur in any column. **Invalid move**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Each column is processed bottom to top. All columns have distinct values with no adjacent duplicates. For example:  \n   - Column 1: `2, 4, 16, 4` has non-adjacent 4s (separated by 16), so no merge.  \n   No merges occur in any column. **Invalid move**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and there are no adjacent tiles of the same value in any direction. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the strategic goal of keeping larger tiles (e.g., 256) in a corner, a downward move is marginally preferred to potentially align smaller tiles for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

For example:\n  - Row 0: 64, 2, 8, 32 (all distinct).\n  - Row 1: 16, 4, 16, 2 (16s are separated by 4).\n  - Column 0: 64, 16, 64, 16 (64s and 16s are separated by other values).\n  - Column 3: 32, 2, 8, 2 (2s are separated by 8).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Since all rows are full and no adjacent tiles in rows are equal, swiping left or right will not shift or merge any tiles. The rows remain unchanged.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Similarly, all columns are full, and no adjacent tiles in columns are equal. Swiping up or down will not shift or merge any tiles. The columns remain unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWith no empty tiles and no adjacent equal tiles, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and all directions result in no movement, the game would end, but the answer must still be chosen from the options.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible merges or shifts for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number to merge. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 8 | 32  \nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 64 | 2  \n\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- Each row is processed left-to-right. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any row (e.g., Row 0: 64, 2, 8, 32; Row 1: 16, 4, 16, 2). Tiles cannot shift left (no zeros), so no merges occur.  \n\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- Each row is processed right-to-left. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any row (e.g., Row 0: 64, 2, 8, 32; Row 1: 16, 4, 16, 2). Tiles cannot shift right (no zeros), so no merges occur.  \n\n\n### UP Move:\n- Each column is processed top-to-bottom. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column (e.g., Column 0: 64, 16, 64, 16; Column 1: 2, 4, 16, 4). Tiles cannot shift up (no zeros), so no merges occur.  \n\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- Each column is processed bottom-to-top. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column (e.g., Column 0: 64, 16, 64, 16; Column 3: 32, 2, 8, 2). Tiles cannot shift down (no zeros), so no merges occur.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions result in no merges or shifts since the grid is full (no zeros) and no adjacent tiles are equal. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid merges, any direction is technically possible (though no tiles move). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

Tiles cannot shift (no empty spaces), so no merges. Invalid.  \n2. **DOWN**: No adjacent equal tiles in any column. Tiles cannot shift (no empty spaces), so no merges. Invalid.  \n3. **UP**: While no adjacent equal tiles exist initially, upward movement could theoretically align tiles if empty spaces were present. However, since the grid is full, no shifts occur. Despite this, strategic intuition suggests keeping larger tiles (e.g., 256) in a corner, and upward movement is often preferred for consolidating tiles.  \n\nGiven the lack of valid merges but the need to choose a direction, **UP** is selected as the most strategic option to potentially set up future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile positioning.

Thus, no merges occur in any direction during this move.\n2. **Strategic Positioning**: The largest tile (256) is in row 2, column 2. To maximize future merging potential, the goal is to keep larger tiles in a corner or aligned for future merges.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: These horizontal moves do not change tile positions (no empty spaces to shift into) and do not enable merges. The grid remains unchanged.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: These vertical moves also do not change tile positions (no empty spaces) and do not enable merges. The grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Decision:\nSince all moves are valid (even if they do not change the grid) and no merges are possible, the choice prioritizes strategic positioning for future moves. Moving UP keeps the 256 tile in the upper half, potentially aligning it with larger tiles in subsequent epochs.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) by checking if tiles can merge or shift, which contributes to scoring and future moves.

The 4s (rows 1 and 3) are not adjacent, so no merges.  \n     - **Column 2**: [8, 16, 256, 64]. All distinct. No merges.  \n     - **Column 3**: [32, 2, 8, 2]. The 2s (rows 1 and 3) are not adjacent, so no merges.  \n   - No merges occur, but strategically, moving UP keeps the large tile (256) in the center, potentially setting up future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are checked for merges. Similar to UP, no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. No merges occur. Tiles cannot shift (grid is full).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves result in no immediate merges, but UP is chosen to maintain positional advantage for future moves, as it avoids disrupting the central 256 tile and may facilitate future merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile movement.

The grid remains unchanged.\n- **UP\/DOWN:** Shifting up or down would also not merge any tiles (no adjacent equals) and cannot move tiles (grid is full). The grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.

No merges occur, and the board remains unchanged (no new tiles added since no empty spaces).  \n- **Total Score**: 0.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP move results in the highest score (172) by merging multiple pairs of tiles (64+64, 16+16, 4+4, 2+2).

However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid merges, any direction is technically invalid, but we select the most neutral option.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for possible merges and strategic tile positioning when swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges and maintain flexibility for future moves.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current 4x4 grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 8 | 32  \nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 64 | 2  \n```\n\n### LEFT and RIGHT Moves:\n- **LEFT**: All rows have distinct adjacent tiles with no empty spaces. No merges occur, and the grid remains unchanged.  \n- **RIGHT**: Similarly, all rows have distinct adjacent tiles with no empty spaces. No merges occur, and the grid remains unchanged.  \n\n### UP Move:\nWhen swiping UP, columns are processed upward. Key merges occur in **Column 0**:\n- Column 0 (top to bottom): `64, 16, 64, 16`. Tiles shift upward, causing `64` (row 0) and `64` (row 2) to merge into `128` (score +128). The `16` (row 1) and `16` (row 3) merge into `32` (score +32). This creates empty spaces (zeros) in rows 1 and 3 of Column 0.  \nOther columns (1, 2, 3) have no merges but remain stable.  \n\n### DOWN Move:\nWhen swiping DOWN, columns are processed downward. Only **Column 0** has a minor merge:\n- Column 0 (bottom to top): `64, 16, 64, 16`. Tiles shift downward, causing `16` (row 1) and `16` (row 3) to merge into `32` (score +32). This creates fewer empty spaces compared to the UP move.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP move results in two significant merges (64+64=128 and 16+16=32) for a total score of 160, while the DOWN move only merges 16+16=32 (score +32). UP also creates more empty spaces, maintaining grid flexibility. LEFT and RIGHT yield no merges.

Swiping down would not merge any tiles, as no two adjacent tiles in any column are equal. No score is gained.\n\n#### **UP**:\nWhen swiping up, columns are processed from top to bottom, and tiles shift upward, merging adjacent equal tiles. Key observations for each column:\n- **Column 1 (64, 16, 64, 16)**:  \n  Tiles shift upward. The 64 (row 3) moves to row 2 (past 16), and 16 (row 4) moves to row 3 (past 64). This results in adjacent 64s (rows 1 and 2) and adjacent 16s (rows 3 and 4), which merge into 128 (score +128) and 32 (score +32), respectively.  \n- **Column 2 (2, 4, 16, 4)**:  \n  Tiles shift upward. The 4 (row 4) moves to row 3 (past 16), resulting in adjacent 4s (rows 2 and 3), which merge into 8 (score +8).  \n- **Column 4 (32, 2, 8, 2)**:  \n  Tiles shift upward. The 2 (row 4) moves to row 3 (past 8), resulting in adjacent 2s (rows 2 and 3), which merge into 4 (score +4).  \n\n**Total score from UP**: \\(128 + 32 + 8 + 4 = 172\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping UP enables multiple strategic merges across columns, maximizing score accumulation. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning. The current board has no empty tiles (all 16 tiles are non-zero), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent equal tiles.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe game board is:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 8 | 32\nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 16 | 2\nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 256 | 8\nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 64 | 2\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles**: All 16 tiles are occupied, so movement requires merging adjacent equal tiles.\n- **No adjacent equal tiles**: Checking all rows and columns, there are no horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles with the same value. For example:\n  - Row 1 has 16s in columns 0 and 2, but they are separated by a 4 (not adjacent).\n  - Column 0 has 64s in rows 0 and 2, but they are separated by a 16 (not adjacent).\n  - Column 1 has 4s in rows 1 and 3, but they are separated by a 16 (not adjacent).\n  - Column 3 has 2s in rows 1 and 3, but they are separated by an 8 (not adjacent).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\nSince there are no adjacent equal tiles, **no merges are possible** in any direction. Additionally, with no empty tiles, tiles cannot shift into new positions. Thus, all moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) will leave the board unchanged, as no tiles can merge or shift.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe goal is to set up for future merges. However, with no valid moves, the game would typically end. Since the problem requires selecting a direction, we choose a direction that minimally disrupts the current structure. LEFT is a neutral choice, as it does not push large tiles (e.g., 256) away from corners.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### **LEFT Direction**  \n- **Row 0**: [64, 2, 8, 32] (no merges, all distinct).  \n- **Row 1**: [16, 4, 16, 2] → 16s merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in [32, 4, 2, 0].  \n- **Row 2**: [64, 16, 256, 8] (no merges, all distinct).  \n- **Row 3**: [16, 4, 64, 2] (no merges, all distinct).  \n**Total Score**: 32.  \n\n### **RIGHT Direction**  \n- **Row 0**: [64, 2, 8, 32] (no merges, all distinct).  \n- **Row 1**: [16, 4, 16, 2] → 16s merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in [4, 2, 0, 32].  \n- **Row 2**: [64, 16, 256, 8] (no merges, all distinct).  \n- **Row 3**: [16, 4, 64, 2] (no merges, all distinct).  \n**Total Score**: 32.  \n\n### **UP Direction**  \n- **Column 0**: [64, 16, 64, 16] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [2, 4, 16, 4] → 4s merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in [2, 8, 16, 0].  \n- **Column 2**: [8, 16, 256, 64] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [32, 2, 8, 2] → 2s merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in [32, 4, 8, 0].  \n**Total Score**: 12.  \n\n### **DOWN Direction**  \n- **Column 0**: [64, 16, 64, 16] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [2, 4, 16, 4] → 4s merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in [2, 16, 0, 8].  \n- **Column 2**: [8, 16, 256, 64] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [32, 2, 8, 2] → 2s merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in [32, 8, 0, 4].  \n**Total Score**: 12.  \n\n### **Comparison**  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 32 points (highest), while UP and DOWN yield 12. Between LEFT and RIGHT, RIGHT is preferable because merging the 16s in Row 1 to the right (resulting in [4, 2, 0, 32]) positions a 32 in Column 3. This aligns with Row 0’s Column 3 (32), creating a potential future merge (32s in Column 3) if followed by an UP move. This strategic positioning supports building larger tiles in the right column, a key strategy for maximizing scores.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning. The current game board is:\n\n```\n64|2|8|32\n16|4|16|2\n64|16|256|8\n16|4|64|2\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid Status**: All tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number to merge.\n2. **Horizontal Adjacents**: No two adjacent tiles in any row have the same number (e.g., row 1: 64, 2, 8, 32; row 2: 16, 4, 16, 2; etc.).\n3. **Vertical Adjacents**: No two adjacent tiles in any column have the same number (e.g., column 1: 64, 16, 64, 16; column 2: 2, 4, 16, 4; etc.).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipes**: Since all rows are already fully occupied with no adjacent duplicates, shifting left or right would not merge any tiles or change the row structure.\n- **UP\/DOWN Swipes**: Similarly, all columns are fully occupied with no adjacent duplicates. Shifting up or down would not merge any tiles or change the column structure.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number to merge. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given no strategic advantage in any direction, a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or shifts in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles to merge. \n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 8 | 32  \nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 64 | 2  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 1 (16, 4, 16, 2) has 16s separated by 4, so no merge. Tiles cannot shift left (no zeros), so no change.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 1 (16, 4, 16, 2) has 16s separated by 4, so no merge. Tiles cannot shift right (no zeros), so no change.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - All columns have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Column 0 (64, 16, 64, 16) has 64s separated by 16, so no merge. Tiles cannot shift up (no zeros), so no change.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - All columns have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Column 3 (32, 2, 8, 2) has 2s separated by 8, so no merge. Tiles cannot shift down (no zeros), so no change.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full (no zeros), and no two adjacent tiles are equal. Thus, no valid moves can merge tiles or shift them. However, the problem requires selecting one of the directions. Since all directions are equally invalid, any direction is technically acceptable, but the choice here is arbitrary.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on whether they enable tile merges or movement into empty spaces (valid moves). The grid is currently full (no zeros), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same number.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 8 | 32\nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 16 | 2\nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 256 | 8\nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 64 | 2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All rows are full, and no adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., Row 0: 64, 2, 8, 32; Row 1: 16, 4, 16, 2).

No merges or movement occur. **Invalid**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent tiles of the same number, meaning no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any direction is technically a placeholder (though all are invalid). \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and merging rules. The grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number to merge. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 1: 64|2|8|32  \nRow 2: 16|4|16|2  \nRow 3: 64|16|256|8  \nRow 4: 16|4|64|2  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles**: All 16 tiles are filled, so movement depends on merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **Adjacent tiles check**: No horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles have the same value. For example:\n  - Row 2 has 16 (column 1) and 16 (column 3), but they are separated by 4 (column 2) and not adjacent.\n  - Column 2 has 4 (row 2) and 4 (row 4), but they are separated by 16 (row 3) and not adjacent.\n  - All other rows and columns also lack adjacent duplicates.\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **LEFT**: Shifting tiles left would not merge any tiles (no adjacent duplicates), so the board remains unchanged.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Shifting tiles right also has no merges (no adjacent duplicates), leaving the board unchanged.  \n3. **UP**: Shifting tiles up does not create adjacent duplicates, so no merges occur.  \n4. **DOWN**: Shifting tiles down similarly fails to create adjacent duplicates, resulting in no merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSince there are no adjacent tiles with the same value and no empty spaces, no valid merges are possible in any direction. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of merges, any direction is technically valid (as the game allows swiping even if no merges occur, though no new tiles are added to a full grid). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for valid moves (merges or tile shifts into empty spaces). The current board has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value in the direction of the swipe.

All rows have distinct numbers with no adjacent duplicates, so no merges occur. Since the grid is full, no tiles can shift, making these moves invalid.  \n2. **UP\/DOWN**: For vertical moves (up\/down), each column is checked for adjacent same numbers. All columns also have distinct numbers with no adjacent duplicates. With no empty spaces, tiles cannot shift, so these moves are also invalid.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent tiles have the same number. Thus, there are no valid moves.

The game board is full (no zeros), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **LEFT Move**  \nAll rows are already left-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. For example:  \n- Row 0: [64, 2, 8, 32] (no merges).  \n- Row 1: [16, 4, 16, 2] (16s are separated by 4, no merge).  \n- Rows 2 and 3 similarly have no adjacent equals.  \nNo merges occur.

Not useful.\n\n### **DOWN Move**  \nColumns are processed bottom to top. Key observation: Column 3 has [32, 2, 8, 2]. When shifting down:  \n- The two 2s (row 1 and row 3) are separated by 8 (row 2). Shifting down moves the 2 in row 1 past 8 to row 3, merging with the 2 in row 3 to form 4.  \n- The 32 in row 0 shifts down to row 1, and 8 in row 2 shifts down to row 2.  \n\nThis results in a merge of the two 2s in column 3, creating a 4 and adding 4 to the score.

Here's the analysis:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 8 | 32  \nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 64 | 2  \n\n\n### LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are 64, 2, 8, 32 (all distinct; no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles are 16, 4, 16, 2 (16s are separated by 4; no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles are 64, 16, 256, 8 (all distinct; no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles are 16, 4, 64, 2 (all distinct; no merges).  \nNo merges occur.  \n\n\n### RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are 64, 2, 8, 32 (all distinct; no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles are 16, 4, 16, 2 (16s are separated by 4; no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles are 64, 16, 256, 8 (all distinct; no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles are 16, 4, 64, 2 (all distinct; no merges).  \nNo merges occur.  \n\n\n### UP Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles are 64 (row0), 16 (row1), 64 (row2), 16 (row3) (64s and 16s are separated; no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles are 2 (row0), 4 (row1), 16 (row2), 4 (row3) (4s are separated by 16; no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles are 8 (row0), 16 (row1), 256 (row2), 64 (row3) (all distinct; no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles are 32 (row0), 2 (row1), 8 (row2), 2 (row3) (2s are separated by 8; no merges).  \nNo merges occur.  \n\n\n### DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles are 64 (row0), 16 (row1), 64 (row2), 16 (row3) (64s and 16s are separated; no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles are 2 (row0), 4 (row1), 16 (row2), 4 (row3) (4s are separated by 16; no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles are 8 (row0), 16 (row1), 256 (row2), 64 (row3) (all distinct; no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles are 32 (row0), 2 (row1), 8 (row2), 2 (row3) (2s are separated by 8; no merges).  \nNo merges occur.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full (no empty tiles), and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same number. Thus, no merges are possible in any direction. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we choose **LEFT** as a default. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and check valid moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential. The game ends after the 100th epoch, so maximizing the score in this final move is critical.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 8 | 32  \nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 64 | 2  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### LEFT\/RIGHT:\n- **LEFT**: All rows have distinct adjacent tiles with no empty spaces. No merges or shifts occur. Not a valid move.  \n- **RIGHT**: Similarly, all rows have distinct adjacent tiles with no empty spaces. No merges or shifts occur. Not a valid move.  \n\n#### UP:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles [64, 16, 64, 16]. When moving up, 64 (row 0) and 64 (row 2) merge into 128 (score +128), and 16 (row 1) and 16 (row 3) merge into 32 (score +32).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles [2, 4, 16, 4]. When moving up, 4 (row 1) and 4 (row 3) merge into 8 (score +8).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles [32, 2, 8, 2]. When moving up, 2 (row 1) and 2 (row 3) merge into 4 (score +4).  \n- **Total Score from UP**: 128 + 32 + 8 + 4 = 172.  \n\n#### DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles [64, 16, 64, 16]. When moving down, 16 (row 1) and 16 (row 3) merge into 32 (score +32).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles [2, 4, 16, 4]. When moving down, 4 (row 1) and 4 (row 3) merge into 8 (score +8).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles [32, 2, 8, 2]. When moving down, 2 (row 1) and 2 (row 3) merge into 4 (score +4).  \n- **Total Score from DOWN**: 32 + 8 + 4 = 44.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the only move that maximizes the score in the final epoch.  \n\nAnswer: UP"],"prompt":"You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n64|2|8|32\n16|4|16|2\n64|16|256|8\n16|4|64|2\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The goal is to position tiles for future merges and follow the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board has two 2s at positions (1,0) and (2,1). The grid is mostly empty, so the priority is to align these 2s for a merge in subsequent moves.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Swiping left shifts tiles in each row to the left. \n   - Row 1 (2,0,0,0) remains [2,0,0,0].\n   - Row 2 (0,2,0,0) shifts to [2,0,0,0].\n   - Result: 2s are at (1,0) and (2,0) (same column, vertically aligned). This allows a potential UP merge next, but no immediate merge.\n\n2. **RIGHT**: Swiping right shifts tiles in each row to the right.\n   - Row 1 (2,0,0,0) shifts to [0,0,0,2].\n   - Row 2 (0,2,0,0) shifts to [0,0,0,2].\n   - Result: 2s are at (1,3) and (2,3) (same column, vertically aligned). This allows a potential DOWN merge next, but no immediate merge.\n\n3. **UP**: Swiping up shifts tiles in each column upward.\n   - Column 0 (0,2,0,0) shifts to [2,0,0,0] (2 moves to row 0).\n   - Column 1 (0,0,2,0) shifts to [2,0,0,0] (2 moves to row 0).\n   - Result: 2s are at (0,0) and (0,1) (same row, horizontally adjacent). This positions them for an immediate LEFT merge in the next move, as they are now adjacent in the top row.\n\n4. **DOWN**: Swiping down shifts tiles in each column downward.\n   - Column 0 (0,2,0,0) shifts to [0,0,0,2] (2 moves to row 3).\n   - Column 1 (0,0,2,0) shifts to [0,0,0,2] (2 moves to row 3).\n   - Result: 2s are at (3,0) and (3,1) (same row, horizontally adjacent). This allows a potential LEFT merge next, but the tiles are in the bottom row, which is less strategic for corner-based growth.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nThe UP move aligns the 2s in the top row (horizontally adjacent), making them primed for a LEFT merge in the next move. This positions the tiles in the top-left corner area, which is ideal for building larger tiles strategically.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging rules:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 2|2|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|2|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: The two adjacent 2s merge into a 4 (score +4). The row becomes [4, 0, 0, 0].  \n   - Row 2: The 2 shifts left to the first position, becoming [2, 0, 0, 0].  \n   - Rows 1 and 3 remain unchanged.  \n   - After merging, the grid (before adding a new tile) is:  \n     [4, 0, 0, 0]  \n     [0, 0, 0, 0]  \n     [2, 0, 0, 0]  \n     [0, 0, 0, 0]  \n   - This move merges tiles, scores 4 points, and positions the merged 4 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for larger tiles).  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: The two 2s shift right and merge into a 4 (score +4). The row becomes [0, 0, 0, 4].  \n   - Row 2: The 2 shifts right to the last position, becoming [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n   - Rows 1 and 3 remain unchanged.  \n   - After merging, the grid (before adding a new tile) is:  \n     [0, 0, 0, 4]  \n     [0, 0, 0, 0]  \n     [0, 0, 0, 2]  \n     [0, 0, 0, 0]  \n   - This move also merges tiles and scores 4 points but positions the 4 in the top-right corner.  \n\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift upward, but no adjacent tiles in any column are the same (each column has only one 2). No merges occur, and no score is added. The grid after shifting (before adding a new tile) is:  \n     [2, 2, 2, 0]  \n     [0, 0, 0, 0]  \n     [0, 0, 0, 0]  \n     [0, 0, 0, 0]  \n   - No strategic advantage here.  \n\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift downward, but no adjacent tiles in any column are the same (each column has only one 2). No merges occur, and no score is added. The grid after shifting (before adding a new tile) is:  \n     [0, 0, 0, 0]  \n     [0, 0, 0, 0]  \n     [0, 0, 0, 0]  \n     [2, 2, 2, 0]  \n   - No strategic advantage here.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge tiles and score 4 points.

However, this scatters the tiles and moves the largest tile away from the initial corner, reducing strategic positioning.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [4,0,2,0] → Shifts up, becomes [4,2,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,0] → Remains empty.  \n- **Column 2**: [0,2,0,0] → Shifts up, becomes [2,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,0] → Remains empty.  \n\n**Resulting Board After UP**:  \nRow 0: 4|0|2|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\nThe 4 stays in (0,0), but the 2s are scattered (0,2 and 1,0), making future merges less likely.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [4,0,2,0] → Shifts down, becomes [0,0,4,2] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,0] → Remains empty.  \n- **Column 2**: [0,2,0,0] → Shifts down, becomes [0,0,0,2] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,0] → Remains empty.  \n\n**Resulting Board After DOWN**:  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 2|0|2|0  \n\nThe 4 moves to (2,0), and the 2s are in (3,0) and (3,2) (not adjacent), reducing strategic value.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving LEFT keeps the largest tile (4) in the corner (0,0) and aligns the 2s vertically in column 0, creating opportunities for future merges. This is the most strategic choice.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

No merges occur because no adjacent tiles are equal. The board becomes:  \n     ```\n     4|2|0|0  \n     2|0|0|0  \n     2|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - No score gain. Not ideal.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row shifts tiles right. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles are equal. The board becomes:  \n     ```\n     0|0|4|2  \n     0|0|0|2  \n     0|0|0|2  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - No score gain. Not ideal.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns shift upward. Focus on Column 0 (values: 4, 2, 2, 0). Non-zero tiles shift up to [4, 2, 2, 0]. The two 2s in rows 1 and 2 merge into a 4 (score +4). The column becomes [4, 4, 0, 0]. Other columns remain unchanged (all zeros except Column 3, which has 2 in row 0). The resulting board:  \n     ```\n     4|0|0|2  \n     4|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - Merging the two 2s in Column 0 gives a score of 4. The 4s in Column 0 (rows 0 and 1) are adjacent, allowing potential future merges (e.g., swiping up again to merge them into 8). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (top-left here).\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns shift downward. Focus on Column 0 (values: 4, 2, 2, 0). Non-zero tiles shift down to [0, 2, 2, 4]. The two 2s in rows 1 and 2 merge into a 4 (score +4). The column becomes [0, 0, 4, 4]. Other columns remain unchanged (all zeros except Column 3, which has 2 in row 3). The resulting board:  \n     ```\n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     4|0|0|0  \n     4|0|0|2  \n     ```  \n   - Merging the two 2s in Column 0 gives a score of 4, but the 4s in Column 0 (rows 2 and 3) are less strategically positioned for future merges compared to the UP outcome.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping UP merges the two 2s into a 4 (score +4) and positions the resulting 4s in the top-left column, creating opportunities for future merges.

Row 2 becomes `2|0|0|0`.  \n   - Other rows remain unchanged (all zeros).  \n   - Result: Merges the two 8s into 16 (top-left corner) and positions the 2 in the left column, which can support future merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: The two 8s (positions (0,0) and (0,3)) shift right. The 8 at (0,0) moves to (0,2), adjacent to the 8 at (0,3). They merge into a 16, scoring 16. Row 0 becomes `0|0|0|16`.  \n   - **Row 2**: The 2 at (2,3) remains in place (no empty spaces to the right). Row 2 stays `0|0|0|2`.  \n   - Other rows remain unchanged (all zeros).  \n   - Result: Merges the two 8s into 16 (top-right corner) but leaves the 2 in the right column.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed vertically. No tiles merge (all tiles are non-adjacent or of different values). The 2 in (2,3) shifts up to (1,3), but no merging occurs.  \n   - Result: No score, minimal tile movement.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed vertically. No tiles merge (all tiles are non-adjacent or of different values). The 8 in (0,0) shifts down to (3,0), and the 2 in (2,3) shifts down to (3,3).  \n   - Result: No score, minimal tile movement.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the two 8s into a 16 (scoring 16). However, LEFT positions the 16 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for building larger tiles) and moves the 2 to the left column, which aligns with the goal of keeping larger tiles in a corner and organizing smaller tiles for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (e.g., consolidating tiles in a corner for future merges). The game board is:\n\n```\n16|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n2|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left. Each row becomes:  \n   - Row 0: `16|0|0|0` (no change).  \n   - Row 1: `8|0|0|0` (8 moves left).  \n   - Row 2: `2|0|0|0` (no change).  \n   - Row 3: `0|0|0|0` (no change).  \n   No merges occur. The 16, 8, and 2 stack vertically in the left column. While this consolidates tiles, the 16 remains in the top-left corner, but the structure is less centralized compared to other options.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right. Each row becomes:  \n   - Row 0: `0|0|0|16` (16 moves right).  \n   - Row 1: `0|0|0|8` (no change).  \n   - Row 2: `0|0|0|2` (2 moves right).  \n   - Row 3: `0|0|0|0` (no change).  \n   No merges occur. The 16, 8, and 2 stack vertically in the right column, with 16 in the top-right corner (a strategic corner). This aligns with the goal of keeping large tiles in a corner, making future merges (e.g., adding a 2 in the bottom-right to merge with the existing 2) more feasible.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up. Columns become:  \n   - Column 0: `16|2|0|0` (16 and 2 move up).  \n   - Column 3: `8|0|0|0` (8 moves up).  \n   The resulting grid scatters the 16 (top-left), 8 (top-right), and 2 (middle-left), leaving them decentralized. This reduces the potential for future merges.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down. Columns become:  \n   - Column 0: `0|0|16|2` (16 and 2 move down).  \n   - Column 3: `0|0|0|8` (8 moves down).  \n   The 16, 8, and 2 are scattered across the grid (16 in row 2, 8 in row 3, 2 in row 3), making consolidation difficult. This is the least strategic option.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT consolidates the largest tiles (16, 8, 2) in the right column, with 16 in the top-right corner. This structure aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner, facilitating future merges as new tiles (2 or 4) spawn in empty spaces.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their effects on the game board, considering tile movement, potential merges, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 1: 4|0|0|8  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,0,16] → shifts left to [16,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [4,0,0,8] → shifts left to [4,8,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,2] → shifts left to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,0,0,0] → remains unchanged.  \n- **Result**: 16 moves to the top-left corner, breaking the existing corner alignment of the largest tile (16 was in the top-right). This is suboptimal for strategic stacking.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,0,16] → no movement (16 is already rightmost).  \n- **Row 1**: [4,0,0,8] → shifts right to [0,0,4,8] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,2] → no movement (2 is already rightmost).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,0,0,0] → remains unchanged.  \n- **Result**: Minimal tile movement; 16 stays in the top-right, but smaller tiles (4, 8, 2) are scattered, reducing opportunities for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [0,4,0,0] → shifts up to [4,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [16,8,2,0] → shifts up to [16,8,2,0] (no merge).  \n- **Other columns**: All zeros, no movement.  \n- **Result**: 4 moves to the top-left, while 16, 8, 2 remain vertically aligned in column 3 (rows 0-2). This retains some vertical stacking but leaves 16 in the top-right without clear progression toward a corner.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [0,4,0,0] → shifts down to [0,0,0,4] (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [16,8,2,0] → shifts down to [0,2,8,16] (no merge).  \n- **Other columns**: All zeros, no movement.  \n- **Result**: 16 moves to the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), 8 to row 2, column 3, and 2 to row 1, column 3. This vertically stacks the largest tiles (2, 8, 16) in the bottom-right corner, aligning with the strategic goal of keeping larger tiles in a corner for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping **DOWN** optimally positions the largest tile (16) in the bottom-right corner, with smaller tiles (8, 2) stacked vertically above it. This arrangement facilitates future merges by keeping larger tiles in a corner, a key strategy for maximizing scores in 2048.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize future merging potential and keep larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|8|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 3: 4|0|0|2  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,8,0,0] → [8,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,16] → [16,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,0,8] → [8,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: [4,0,0,2] → [4,2,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Result: Tiles shift left, but no merges. The 16 (largest tile) moves to row 1, column 0 (a corner, but less strategic).  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,8,0,0] → [0,0,0,8] (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,16] → [0,0,0,16] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,0,8] → [0,0,0,8] (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: [4,0,0,2] → [0,0,4,2] (no merge).  \n   - Result: Tiles shift right. The 16 (largest tile) stays in row 1, column 3 (southeast corner). The 8 in row 0, column 1 moves to row 0, column 3, aligning with the 8 in row 2, column 3 (same column), increasing future merging potential.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,0,0,4] → [4,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Column 1: [8,0,0,0] → [8,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: [0,16,8,2] → [16,8,2,0] (no merge).  \n   - Result: Tiles shift up. The 16 moves to row 0, column 3 (northeast corner), but disrupts alignment of smaller tiles.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,0,0,4] → [0,0,0,4] (no merge).  \n   - Column 1: [8,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,8] (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: [0,16,8,2] → [0,16,8,2] (no merge).  \n   - Result: Tiles shift down. The 16 remains in row 1, column 3, but the 8 in row 0, column 1 moves to row 3, column 1, reducing alignment with other 8s.  \n\n\n### Strategic Choice:  \nSwiping RIGHT keeps the largest tile (16) in the southeast corner and aligns the 8 in row 0, column 1 with the 8 in row 2, column 3 (same column), creating future merging opportunities. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and positioning smaller tiles for potential merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the current game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 2: 0|0|4|8  \nRow 3: 0|0|4|2  \n\n\n### 1. Swipe LEFT  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,0,8] → [8,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,16] → [16,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,4,8] → [4,8,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,0,4,2] → [4,2,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Result**: No merges occur, and tiles shift left. This is a valid move but does not strategically improve tile grouping.  \n\n\n### 2. Swipe RIGHT  \n- All tiles in each row are already shifted to the rightmost positions (no empty spaces to the right of any tile).  \n- **Result**: No tiles move, so this is an **invalid move**.  \n\n\n### 3. Swipe UP  \n- **Column 2** (tiles [0,0,4,4]): The two 4s merge into an 8 (score +8), shifting to the top of the column.  \n- **Column 3** (tiles [8,16,8,2]): Tiles remain in place (no merges possible).  \n- **Resulting Grid** (before new tile):  \n  Row 0: 0|0|8|8  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|16  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|8  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|2  \n- **Key Benefit**: The merged 8 in Column 2 and adjacent 8s in Row 0 (Columns 2-3) create opportunities for future merges (e.g., swiping RIGHT next could merge the two 8s in Row 0 into 16). Larger tiles (16, 8s) are concentrated in the top-right corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.  \n\n\n### 4. Swipe DOWN  \n- **Column 2** (tiles [0,0,4,4]): The two 4s merge into an 8 (score +8), shifting to the bottom of the column.  \n- **Column 3** (tiles [8,16,8,2]): Tiles remain in place (no merges possible).  \n- **Resulting Grid** (before new tile):  \n  Row 0: 0|0|0|8  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|16  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|8  \n  Row 3: 0|0|8|2  \n- **Key Drawback**: The merged 8 in Column 2 (Row 3) is isolated, and larger tiles (16, 8s) are spread out, reducing opportunities for future merges compared to the UP direction.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nSwipping UP merges two 4s into an 8 (scoring 8), concentrates larger tiles in the top-right corner, and creates adjacent 8s in Row 0 (Columns 2-3) for potential future merges. This aligns with the strategic goal of grouping large tiles in a corner and maximizing merge opportunities.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize tile merges and position larger tiles strategically (preferably in a corner).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|8|8  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 2: 0|0|8|8  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|2  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,0,8,8] → merges to [16,0,0,0] (score +16).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,16] → shifts to [16,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,8,8] → merges to [16,0,0,0] (score +16).  \n   - Row 3: [0,0,0,2] → shifts to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n   Result: 16s are in column 0 (leftmost), but this scatters 16s across rows, limiting future merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,0,8,8] → merges to [0,0,0,16] (score +16).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,16] → remains [0,0,0,16] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,8,8] → merges to [0,0,0,16] (score +16).  \n   - Row 3: [0,0,0,2] → remains [0,0,0,2] (no merge).  \n   Result: 16s are in column 3 (rightmost), aligning vertically with the existing 16 in Row 1, Column 3. This positions larger tiles in the right corner, ideal for future vertical merges (e.g., swiping UP could merge these 16s into 32).\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 2: [8,0,8,0] → merges to [16,0,0,0] (score +16).  \n   - Column 3: [8,16,8,2] → no merges (tiles are non-adjacent after shifting).  \n   Result: Only one merge (column 2), with 16s scattered, reducing strategic value.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 2: [8,0,8,0] → merges to [0,0,0,16] (score +16).  \n   - Column 3: [8,16,8,2] → no merges (tiles remain non-adjacent after shifting).  \n   Result: Only one merge (column 2), with 16s and smaller tiles spread out, limiting future potential.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe RIGHT swipe aligns all 16s in the rightmost column (column 3), creating a corner of larger tiles. This setup maximizes future merge opportunities (e.g., swiping UP next could merge these 16s into 32), making RIGHT the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|4|16  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|2  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Each row shifts tiles left. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles are equal. The resulting board would have tiles shifted left but no score gain. This is not optimal.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   All tiles are already at the right edge of their rows. No tiles can move further right, and no adjacent equal tiles exist to merge. This is an invalid move.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward, merging equal adjacent tiles in columns. Focusing on Column 3 (the only column with non-zero tiles):  \n   - Column 3: [16 (row0), 16 (row1), 16 (row2), 2 (row3)].  \n   - Merging the top two 16s (row0 and row1) creates a 32 (score +32). The remaining 16 (row2) shifts to row1, and the 2 (row3) shifts to row2.  \n   Resulting board after moving up:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|4|32  \n   Row 1: 0|0|0|16  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|2  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   The 32 (largest tile) is placed in the top-right corner (a strategic corner), which is ideal for future merges.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward. Column 3 merges the bottom two 16s (row1 and row2) into a 32 (score +32). However, the 32 would end up in row2, column3 (not a corner). This is less strategic than placing the 32 in the top-right corner.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP merges two 16s into a 32, gains 32 points, and positions the largest tile (32) in the top-right corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners. This is the best move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the current game board and strategic goals (e.g., consolidating large tiles in corners, setting up future merges).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|4|32\nRow 1: 0|0|0|16\nRow 2: 0|0|0|2\nRow 3: 16|0|0|0\n```\nKey tiles: The largest tile is 32 (row 0, column 3), followed by two 16s (row 1, column 3 and row 3, column 0), and a 2 (row 2, column 3).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0 shifts to `4|32|0|0` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1 shifts to `16|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 2 shifts to `2|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 3 remains `16|0|0|0`.  \n   - Result: Scattered tiles with 16s in column 0 (row 1 and 3), but no immediate merge potential. Larger tiles (32, 16) are not in corners.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0 remains `0|0|4|32`.  \n   - Row 1 remains `0|0|0|16`.  \n   - Row 2 remains `0|0|0|2`.  \n   - Row 3 shifts to `0|0|0|16`.  \n   - Result: 16s in column 3 (row 1 and 3), but no adjacency for merging. Larger tiles (32, 16) are spread across the right column, not consolidated.  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: 16 stays in row 3.  \n   - Column 2: 4 shifts to row 3.  \n   - Column 3: 32 shifts to row 1, 16 to row 2, 2 to row 3.  \n   - Result: Board becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|32  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|16  \n     Row 3: 16|0|4|2  \n     ```  \n   - Larger tiles (32, 16) are in the right column but not in corners. Empty spaces are in the top row, but no clear path for future merges.  \n\n4. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: 16 shifts to row 0 (top-left corner).  \n   - Column 2: 4 shifts to row 0.  \n   - Column 3: 32 stays in row 0 (top-right corner), 16 in row 1, 2 in row 2.  \n   - Result: Board becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 16|0|4|32  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|16  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|2  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - **Key Advantage**: The largest tiles (32, 16) are now in the top row, with 16 in the top-left corner and 32 in the top-right corner. This consolidates large tiles in corners, a strategic priority. The bottom row is empty, allowing flexibility for new tiles and future merges (e.g., 16 in row 1, column 3 could shift up later to merge with others).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving **UP** optimally positions the largest tiles (16, 32) in corners and leaves empty space in the bottom row, setting up for future strategic merges. \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, positioning larger tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16 | 0 | 4 | 32  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 16  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 2  \nRow 3: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Tiles shift left in each row.  \n  - Row 0: 16, 0, 4, 32 → 16, 4, 32, 0 (no merges).  \n  - Row 1: 0, 0, 0, 16 → 16, 0, 0, 0 (no merges).  \n  - Row 2: 0, 0, 0, 2 → 2, 0, 0, 0 (no merges).  \n  - Row 3: 8, 0, 0, 0 → 8, 0, 0, 0 (no merges).  \n- No immediate merges. Larger tiles (16, 32) are spread across the left and middle columns, not optimized for corners.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Tiles shift right in each row.  \n  - Row 0: 16, 0, 4, 32 → 0, 16, 4, 32 (no merges).  \n  - Row 1: 0, 0, 0, 16 → 0, 0, 0, 16 (no merges).  \n  - Row 2: 0, 0, 0, 2 → 0, 0, 0, 2 (no merges).  \n  - Row 3: 8, 0, 0, 0 → 0, 0, 0, 8 (no merges).  \n- No immediate merges. Larger tiles (32, 16) remain in the right column, but the 8 moves to the bottom-right, which is a corner. However, the right column has tiles in ascending order (2, 8, 16, 32), which is suboptimal for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Tiles shift upward in each column.  \n  - Column 0: 16, 0, 0, 8 → 16, 8, 0, 0 (no merges).  \n  - Column 1: 0, 0, 0, 0 → 0, 0, 0, 0 (no changes).  \n  - Column 2: 4, 0, 0, 0 → 4, 0, 0, 0 (no merges).  \n  - Column 3: 32, 16, 2, 0 → 32, 16, 2, 0 (no merges).  \n- No immediate merges. Larger tiles (32, 16) stay in the top rows, but the board remains fragmented.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles shift downward in each column.  \n  - Column 0: 16, 0, 0, 8 → 0, 0, 16, 8 (no merges).  \n  - Column 1: 0, 0, 0, 0 → 0, 0, 0, 0 (no changes).  \n  - Column 2: 4, 0, 0, 0 → 0, 0, 0, 4 (no merges).  \n  - Column 3: 32, 16, 2, 0 → 0, 32, 16, 2 (no merges).  \n- No immediate merges, but the right column (Column 3) becomes [0, 32, 16, 2], which arranges larger tiles (32, 16) in descending order from top to bottom. This positions them in the right column (a corner), aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhile no move results in an immediate merge, **DOWN** optimally positions larger tiles (32, 16) in the right column (a corner), setting up for potential future merges.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) on the given game board:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|32\nRow 2: 16|0|0|16\nRow 3: 8|8|4|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,32] → shifts left to [32,0,0,0].  \n- **Row 2**: [16,0,0,16] → 16s merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in [32,0,0,0].  \n- **Row 3**: [8,8,4,2] → 8s merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in [16,4,2,0].  \n- **Resulting Board**:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 1: 32|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 32|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 16|4|2|0  \n  ```  \n- **Score Gained**: 32 + 16 = 48.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,32] → already rightmost; no change.  \n- **Row 2**: [16,0,0,16] → 16s shift right and merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in [0,0,0,32].  \n- **Row 3**: [8,8,4,2] → 8s merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in [0,16,4,2].  \n- **Resulting Board**:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|32  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|32  \n  Row 3: 0|16|4|2  \n  ```  \n- **Score Gained**: 32 + 16 = 48.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Columns are processed upward**:  \n  - Column 0: [0,0,16,8] → shifts up to [16,8,0,0].  \n  - Column 1: [0,0,0,8] → shifts up to [8,0,0,0].  \n  - Column 2: [0,0,0,4] → shifts up to [4,0,0,0].  \n  - Column 3: [0,32,16,2] → shifts up to [32,16,2,0].  \n- **No merges occur** (all tiles are distinct in their columns).  \n- **Resulting Board**:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 16|8|4|32  \n  Row 1: 8|0|0|16  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|2  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n  ```  \n- **Score Gained**: 0.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Columns are processed downward**:  \n  - All tiles are already at the bottom of their columns (no movement or merges).  \n- **Invalid Move**: No tiles shift or merge.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 48 points, but RIGHT is preferable. After RIGHT, the two 32s in Row 1 and Row 2 (Column 3) are vertically aligned in the rightmost column, creating a strategic corner for future merges (e.g., merging into 64 with an UP move). This aligns with the goal of keeping larger tiles in a corner.

Other tiles include 32, 16, 8, and 2, with many empty spaces (rows 2 and 3).\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles in rows 0 and 1 are already shifted to the rightmost possible positions (columns 1-3). Swiping right would not move any tiles, making this an invalid move.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Tiles in rows 0 and 1 are already in the topmost rows. Swiping up would not shift any tiles (they cannot move above row 0), making this an invalid move.\n\n3. **LEFT**:  \n   Swiping left would shift tiles in rows 0 and 1 to the left:  \n   - Row 0: [0,32,8,64] → [32,8,64,0] (no merging).  \n   - Row 1: [0,16,32,2] → [16,32,2,0] (no merging).  \n   This is a valid move but leaves the 64 in row 0, column 2 (not a corner) and spreads tiles across rows 0 and 1.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Swiping down shifts tiles in rows 0 and 1 to the bottom (rows 2 and 3):  \n   - Column 1 (32,16,0,0) → [0,0,32,16] (tiles move down to rows 2 and 3).  \n   - Column 2 (8,32,0,0) → [0,0,8,32] (tiles move down to rows 2 and 3).  \n   - Column 3 (64,2,0,0) → [0,0,64,2] (tiles move down to rows 2 and 3).  \n   Resulting board:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 0|32|8|64  \n   Row 3: 0|16|32|2  \n   ```  \n   This move consolidates tiles in the lower rows, positioning the largest tile (64) in the bottom-right corner (row 2, column 3), a strategic corner for building larger tiles. It also leaves the top rows empty, reducing the risk of blocking future merges.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move, as it positions the largest tile (64) in a corner and consolidates tiles in the lower rows, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners for better merging opportunities.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (maximizing score, positioning large tiles in corners).

The largest tile (64) moves to the top-right corner, but smaller tiles (8, 32) are scattered below, limiting future merging potential.\n\n### DOWN\n- **Column 0**: All zeros → no change.\n- **Column 1**: [8,0,32,16] → [0,8,32,16] (no merges, as 8, 32, 16 are distinct).\n- **Column 2**: [0,0,8,32] → [0,0,8,32] (no merges, as 8, 32 are distinct).\n- **Column 3**: [0,0,64,2] → [0,0,2,64] (no merges, but the largest tile (64) moves to the **bottom-right corner**, a strategic position).\n- **Result**: No merges, but the largest tile (64) is now in the bottom-right corner, adjacent to the 32 in row 3, column 2. This positions larger tiles to potentially merge in future moves (e.g., 32 in row 3, column 2 could align with another 32 to form 64, which could then merge with the 64 in the corner).\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile no direction immediately merges tiles, **DOWN** is optimal because it positions the largest tile (64) in the bottom-right corner, a strategic corner that facilitates future merging of adjacent tiles (e.g., 32 in row 3, column 2).\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to align tiles for future merges and keep larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 4|8|0|0\nRow 2: 0|32|8|64\nRow 3: 0|16|32|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. Row 1 becomes `4|8|0|0`, Row 2 becomes `32|8|64|0`, and Row 3 becomes `16|32|2|0`. No merges, so score remains 0.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur. Row 1 becomes `0|0|4|8`, Row 2 remains `0|32|8|64`, and Row 3 remains `0|16|32|2`. No merges, score remains 0.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward. Let’s process each column:  \n   - **Column 0**: `[0,4,0,0]` → shifts to `[4,0,0,0]` (no merge).  \n   - **Column 1**: `[0,8,32,16]` → shifts to `[8,32,16,0]` (no merge).  \n   - **Column 2**: `[0,0,8,32]` → shifts to `[8,32,0,0]` (no merge).  \n   - **Column 3**: `[0,0,64,2]` → shifts to `[64,2,0,0]` (no merge).  \n\n   After shifting, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 4|8|8|64  \n   Row 1: 0|32|32|2  \n   Row 2: 0|16|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   Notably, the two `8`s in Row 0 (columns 1 and 2) are now adjacent horizontally. This sets up a future merge opportunity (e.g., a subsequent LEFT swipe would merge these `8`s into a `16`, yielding a score of 16).  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward, but no merges occur. Row 3 becomes `4|16|32|2`, and other rows remain mostly unchanged.

This maintains a corner-focused structure, a key strategy for future merges. LEFT scatters large tiles, reducing merge potential. UP\/DOWN provide no score and do not improve tile alignment.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|4|16|64  \nRow 1: 0|0|64|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|16|32  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|8  \n```\nKey observations:\n- The largest tile (64) is in the top-right corner (Row 0, Column 3).\n- There are no adjacent tiles with the same number, so no immediate merges are possible.\n- Valid moves require either tile movement into empty spaces or merging adjacent tiles.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Each Direction:\n#### 1. LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: [0,4,16,64] → Shifts left to [4,16,64,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,64,2] → Shifts left to [64,2,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,16,32] → Shifts left to [16,32,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,0,0,8] → Shifts left to [8,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Outcome**: Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. The 64 in Row 0, Column 3 moves to Row 0, Column 2, leaving the top-right corner empty. This disrupts the corner positioning of the largest tile.  \n\n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: [0,4,16,64] → No movement (64 is already rightmost).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,64,2] → No movement (64 and 2 are already right-aligned).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,16,32] → No movement (16 and 32 are already right-aligned).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,0,0,8] → No movement (8 is already rightmost).  \n- **Outcome**: No tiles move. Not a valid move.  \n\n\n#### 3. UP:\n- **Column 0**: All zeros → No movement.  \n- **Column 1**: [4,0,0,0] → 4 remains in Row 0 (no movement).  \n- **Column 2**: [16,64,16,0] → Tiles shift up but remain in their original relative positions (no merges or movement).  \n- **Column 3**: [64,2,32,8] → Tiles are already top-aligned (no movement).  \n- **Outcome**: No tiles move. Not a valid move.  \n\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: All zeros → No movement.  \n- **Column 1**: [4,0,0,0] → 4 shifts down to Row 3, Column 1.  \n- **Column 2**: [16,64,16,0] → 16 (Row 0) shifts down to Row 1, Column 2; 64 (Row 1) shifts down to Row 2, Column 2; 16 (Row 2) shifts down to Row 3, Column 2.  \n- **Column 3**: [64,2,32,8] → Tiles remain in place (no movement).  \n- **Outcome**: Tiles shift down, with the 4 in Row 0, Column 1 moving to Row 3, Column 1. The largest tile (64) remains in the top-right corner (Row 0, Column 3), preserving the corner positioning.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only valid moves are LEFT and DOWN. However, DOWN preserves the largest tile (64) in the top-right corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners. LEFT disrupts this positioning by moving the 64 out of the corner.

Larger tiles (64s) are moved to the left edge, but this disrupts the top-right corner (where a 64 was previously positioned).\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,0,0,64] → no change (64 is already right-aligned).  \n   - Row 1: [8,0,16,2] → shifts right to [0,8,16,2] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,64,32] → no change (64 and 32 are right-aligned).  \n   - Row 3: [0,4,16,8] → shifts right to [0,4,16,8] (no merge).  \n   - Result: No merges, and tiles remain scattered with minimal alignment.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,8,0,0] → shifts up to [8,0,0,0].  \n   - Column 1: [0,0,0,4] → shifts up to [4,0,0,0].  \n   - Column 2: [0,16,64,16] → shifts up to [16,64,16,0] (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: [64,2,32,8] → shifts up to [64,2,32,8] (no merge).  \n   - Result: Tiles shift upward, grouping smaller tiles (8, 4) in the top row. The 64 at (0,3) remains in the top-right corner (a strategic corner for large tiles), and the 64 at (2,2) moves to (1,2), maintaining proximity to the corner. This alignment facilitates future vertical merges.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,8,0,0] → shifts down to [0,0,0,8].  \n   - Column 1: [0,0,0,4] → shifts down to [0,0,0,4].  \n   - Column 2: [0,16,64,16] → shifts down to [0,16,64,16] (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: [64,2,32,8] → shifts down to [64,2,32,8] (no merge).  \n   - Result: Tiles shift downward, scattering smaller tiles and moving the 8 from row 1 to row 3. The 64s remain misaligned, and no strategic corner positioning is achieved.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving **UP** is optimal. It groups smaller tiles (8, 4) in the top row, retains the 64 in the top-right corner (a strategic position), and aligns the second 64 (from row 2) closer to the corner. This setup enhances future merging opportunities and maintains a favorable tile distribution.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize merges and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 4 | 16 | 64\nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 64 | 2\nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 16 | 32\nRow 3: 0 | 4 | 0 | 8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles are already left-aligned (8, 4, 16, 64) with no merges.  \n   - Row 1: Shifts 64 and 2 left to (64, 2, 0, 0) with no merges.  \n   - Row 2: Shifts 16 and 32 left to (16, 32, 0, 0) with no merges.  \n   - Row 3: Shifts 4 and 8 left to (4, 8, 0, 0) with no merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges, minimal tile rearrangement.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles are already right-aligned (8, 4, 16, 64) with no merges.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles (0, 0, 64, 2) remain unchanged with no merges.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles (0, 0, 16, 32) remain unchanged with no merges.  \n   - Row 3: Shifts 4 and 8 right to (0, 0, 4, 8) with no merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges, no meaningful rearrangement.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: Tiles (8, 0, 0, 0) shift up to (8, 0, 0, 0) with no merges.  \n   - Column 1: Tiles (4, 0, 0, 4) shift up, merging the two 4s into 8 (score +8). The column becomes (8, 0, 0, 0).  \n   - Column 2: Tiles (16, 64, 16, 0) shift up to (16, 64, 16, 0) with no merges.  \n   - Column 3: Tiles (64, 2, 32, 8) remain unchanged with no merges.  \n   **Result**: Merges 4+4=8 (score +8). The board after merging (before new tile) is:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 8 | 8 | 16 | 64  \n   Row 1: 0 | 0 | 64 | 2  \n   Row 2: 0 | 0 | 16 | 32  \n   Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 8  \n   ```  \n   This positions larger tiles (64, 16, 8) in the top row, adjacent to potential future merges (e.g., 8+8 in Row 0).\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: Tiles (8, 0, 0, 0) shift down to (0, 0, 0, 8) with no merges.  \n   - Column 1: Tiles (4, 0, 0, 4) shift down, merging the two 4s into 8 (score +8). The column becomes (0, 0, 0, 8).  \n   - Column 2: Tiles (16, 64, 16, 0) shift down to (0, 16, 64, 16) with no merges.  \n   - Column 3: Tiles (64, 2, 32, 8) remain unchanged with no merges.  \n   **Result**: Merges 4+4=8 (score +8). The board after merging (before new tile) is:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 64  \n   Row 1: 0 | 0 | 16 | 2  \n   Row 2: 0 | 0 | 64 | 32  \n   Row 3: 8 | 8 | 16 | 8  \n   ```  \n   This scatters smaller tiles (8s) in the bottom row, less conducive to future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP swipe merges two 4s into 8 (score +8) and positions larger tiles (64, 16, 8) in the top row, with adjacent 8s in Row 0 that can merge in future moves. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and facilitating future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of moving LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. The goal is to maximize score through merging and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 8 | 16 | 64  \nRow 1: 16 | 0 | 64 | 2  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 16 | 32  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 8  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: [8, 8, 16, 64] → The two 8s merge into 16 (score +8). The row becomes [16, 16, 64, 0].  \n- **Row 1**: [16, 0, 64, 2] → Shifts left to [16, 64, 2, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [0, 0, 16, 32] → Shifts left to [16, 32, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 0, 8] → Shifts left to [8, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n**Total Score Gain**: 8.  \n\n\n#### 2. RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: [8, 8, 16, 64] → The two 8s merge into 16 (score +8), then the resulting 16 (from the merge) and the original 16 merge into 32 (score +16). The row becomes [0, 0, 32, 64].  \n- **Row 1**: [16, 0, 64, 2] → Shifts right to [0, 16, 64, 2] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [0, 0, 16, 32] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 16, 32] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 0, 8] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 0, 8] (no merges).  \n**Total Score Gain**: 24 (8 + 16).  \n\n\n#### 3. UP Move:\n- Columns are processed top-to-bottom. No tiles merge, and no tiles shift significantly (e.g., Column 0: [8, 16, 0, 0] remains [8, 16, 0, 0]; Column 1: [8, 0, 0, 0] remains [8, 0, 0, 0]; etc.).  \n**Total Score Gain**: 0.  \n\n\n#### 4. DOWN Move:\n- Columns are processed bottom-to-top. No tiles merge, and tiles shift but do not combine (e.g., Column 0: [8, 16, 0, 0] shifts to [0, 0, 8, 16]; Column 1: [8, 0, 0, 0] shifts to [0, 0, 0, 8]; etc.).  \n**Total Score Gain**: 0.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe RIGHT move yields the highest score gain (24) by merging two pairs of tiles in Row 0. This move also positions larger tiles (32 and 64) toward the right, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner for future merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

Result: [4, 64, 0, 0] (score +64).  \n   - **Row 3**: [0, 0, 0, 8] → Shifts left to [8, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   **Post-LEFT Board**:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 32 | 64 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 1: 16 | 64 | 2 | 0  \n   Row 2: 4 | 64 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 3: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   ```  \n   Key advantage: Three 64s align vertically in Column 1 (rows 0, 1, 2), enabling future vertical merges (e.g., swiping up could merge these 64s for a higher score).\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: [0, 0, 32, 64] → Shifts right (no merge).  \n   - **Row 1**: [0, 16, 64, 2] → Shifts right (no merge).  \n   - **Row 2**: [0, 4, 32, 32] → Shifts right, merging the two 32s into 64.

Tiles shift up but no score is gained. The board remains nearly unchanged, with no strategic benefit.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Columns are processed downward, but no adjacent equal tiles exist to merge. Tiles shift down but no score is gained. The board remains nearly unchanged, with no strategic benefit.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe merges the two 32s in Row 2 for an immediate score of 64 and aligns three 64s vertically in Column 1, setting up for future high-value merges.

No merges occur.  \n- Outcome: No score gain, tiles remain mostly unchanged.  \n\n### **RIGHT Move**  \nShifting all tiles right:  \n- No adjacent equal tiles in any row. No merges occur.  \n- Outcome: No score gain, tiles shift right but remain unmerged.  \n\n### **UP Move**  \nShifting all tiles up (column-wise processing):  \n- **Column 0**: [32, 16, 4, 8] (all distinct, no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [64, 64, 64, 0].

However, strategic placement of larger tiles (e.g., keeping them in corners) is critical. The UP move places the new 128 in Row 0 (top row), adjacent to the 32 in the top-left corner, which aligns with the strategy of consolidating larger tiles in a corner. The DOWN move places the 128 in Row 2 (middle row), which is less optimal for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on valid moves and strategic positioning of tiles. The goal is to shift tiles to maximize future merging potential and keep larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 128 | 8 | 0\nRow 1: 16 | 64 | 2 | 0\nRow 2: 4 | 16 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All tiles in each row are already left-aligned (no empty spaces to the left of non-zero tiles). No tiles move, and no merges occur. This is not a valid move.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles in each row shift right to fill empty spaces:  \n   - Row 0: `[32, 128, 8, 0]` → `[0, 32, 128, 8]` (tiles shift right).  \n   - Row 1: `[16, 64, 2, 0]` → `[0, 16, 64, 2]` (tiles shift right).  \n   - Row 2: `[4, 16, 0, 0]` → `[0, 0, 4, 16]` (tiles shift right).  \n   - Row 3: `[8, 0, 0, 0]` → `[0, 0, 0, 8]` (tile shifts right).  \n   All rows experience movement, making this a valid move. Larger tiles (128, 64) are positioned on the right side, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner (top-right\/right edge).  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles in each column are already as high as possible (no empty spaces above non-zero tiles). No tiles move, and no merges occur. This is not a valid move.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles in columns shift down, but only columns 1 and 2 experience minor movement (e.g., column 1: `[128, 64, 16, 0]` → `[0, 128, 64, 16]`). However, larger tiles (128, 64) end up in the middle of the grid, which is less strategic than positioning them in a corner.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nRIGHT is the best move, as it shifts tiles to the right edge, positions larger tiles (128, 64) near the top-right corner, and maintains flexibility for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (e.g., merging tiles, grouping larger tiles in corners, and setting up future merges). The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 0|32|128|8\nRow 1: 4|16|64|2\nRow 2: 0|0|4|16\nRow 3: 0|0|0|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift to the right, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). The board remains largely unchanged, with no strategic grouping of larger tiles.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward, but no merges occur (columns have no adjacent equal tiles). The largest tile (128) stays in row 0, column 2, but smaller tiles are spread out, offering limited future merge potential.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward, but no merges occur (columns have no adjacent equal tiles). Larger tiles (128, 64, 32) are spread across rows 1 and 2, which does not align with the strategy of grouping large tiles in a corner.\n\n4. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, with no immediate merges, but this direction strategically groups larger tiles toward the left edge, a common corner strategy. After shifting left:  \n   - Row 0 becomes `32|128|8|0` (32, 128, and 8 are grouped left).  \n   - Row 1 remains `4|16|64|2` (smaller tiles grouped left).  \n   - Row 2 becomes `4|16|0|0` (4 and 16 grouped left).  \n   - Row 3 becomes `8|0|0|0` (8 grouped left).  \n\n   This grouping sets up future merges (e.g., 4s in column 0, 16s in column 1) and positions larger tiles (32, 128) in the top-left area, a strong corner for building higher tiles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the best move, as it groups tiles strategically for future merges and aligns with the goal of keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

RIGHT Move:\n- Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur.  \n- Result: No score gain; board remains mostly unchanged.  \n\n#### 3. UP Move:\n- Tiles shift upward, merging in columns where adjacent equal tiles exist:  \n  - **Column 0 (32, 4, 4, 8):** The two 4s (rows 1 and 2) merge into 8 (score +8). The resulting 8 (row 1) and 8 (row 3) merge into 16 (score +16).  \n  - **Column 1 (128, 16, 16, 0):** The two 16s (rows 1 and 2) merge into 32 (score +32).  \n  - Other columns (2 and 3) have no merges.  \n- Total score gain: \\(8 + 16 + 32 = 56\\).  \n- Post-move board (simplified):  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 32 | 128 | 8 | 2  \n  Row 1: 16 | 32 | 64 | 32  \n  Row 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  ```  \n- Strategic advantage: Large tiles (128, 64) remain in upper rows, preserving space for future merges.  \n\n#### 4. DOWN Move:\n- Tiles shift downward, merging in columns where adjacent equal tiles exist:  \n  - **Column 0 (32, 4, 4, 8):** The two 4s (rows 1 and 2) merge into 8 (score +8). The resulting 8 (row 2) and 8 (row 3) merge into 16 (score +16).  \n  - **Column 1 (128, 16, 16, 0):** The two 16s (rows 1 and 2) merge into 32 (score +32).  \n  - Other columns (2 and 3) have no merges.  \n- Total score gain: \\(8 + 16 + 32 = 56\\).  \n- Post-move board (simplified):  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 2: 32 | 128 | 8 | 2  \n  Row 3: 16 | 32 | 64 | 32  \n  ```  \n- Strategic disadvantage: Large tiles (128, 64) move to lower rows, reducing flexibility for future merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nUP and DOWN yield the same score, but UP preserves larger tiles (128, 64) in upper rows, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners for future merges.

No change.  \n- **Row 1**: The two 64s in columns 2 and 3 merge into 128. Row becomes: 16|32|128|0 (score +128).  \n- **Row 2**: The 32 in column 2 shifts left to column 0. Row becomes: 32|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 3**: No change.  \n\nResulting board (after LEFT):  \nRow 0: 32|128|8|2  \nRow 1: 16|32|128|0  \nRow 2: 32|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### **RIGHT Move**  \n- **Row 0**: All tiles (32, 128, 8, 2) are distinct and cannot merge. No change.  \n- **Row 1**: The two 64s in columns 2 and 3 merge into 128 (now in column 3). Row becomes: 16|32|0|128 (score +128).  \n- **Row 2**: The 32 in column 2 shifts right to column 3. Row becomes: 0|0|0|32.  \n- **Row 3**: No change.  \n\nResulting board (after RIGHT):  \nRow 0: 32|128|8|2  \nRow 1: 16|32|0|128  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|32  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### **UP Move**  \n- All columns have distinct or non-adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift upward (no empty spaces above existing tiles). **No valid movement.**  \n\n\n### **DOWN Move**  \n- Tiles shift downward, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. No merges occur. The board rearranges with tiles shifted to the bottom, but no strategic benefit (e.g., 32, 128, 8, etc., are scattered).  \n\n\n### **Optimal Move**  \nBoth LEFT and RIGHT merge the 64s into 128 (score +128). However, RIGHT positions the merged 128 in the rightmost column (row 1, column 3), aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners. This reduces the risk of disrupting larger tiles with future random tile spawns.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning.\n\n### Game Board State:\n```\nRow 0: 32|128|8|2\nRow 1: 16|16|32|128\nRow 2: 0|0|0|32\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **UP Move**:  \n   Tiles shift upward. All columns have no adjacent equal tiles, and tiles are already as high as possible. No merges or movement occur. **Invalid move** (no valid shifts or merges).\n\n2. **DOWN Move**:  \n   Tiles shift downward. Columns are processed from bottom to top, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. Tiles shift but do not merge. No score gain. **No strategic benefit**.\n\n3. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   Tiles shift right. For Row 1: `16|16|32|128`, the two `16`s merge into `32` (score +32), resulting in `0|32|32|128`. Other rows (Row 0, 2, 3) have no merges. While merging the `16`s is beneficial, the merged `32`s end up in the middle of the row, limiting future merge potential.\n\n4. **LEFT Move**:  \n   Tiles shift left. For Row 1: `16|16|32|128`, the two `16`s merge into `32` (score +32), resulting in `32|32|128|0`. Row 2: `0|0|0|32` shifts left to `32|0|0|0`. Row 0: `32|128|8|2` has no merges but remains unchanged. This move merges the `16`s, positions `32`s in Row 1 adjacently (for future merges), and consolidates tiles to the left, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT move provides the best strategic advantage by merging the `16`s (immediate score gain) and positioning tiles for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, score gain, and future strategy (keeping larger tiles in corners and setting up future merges).\n\n### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: [32, 128, 8, 2] (no merges, tiles already left-aligned).  \n- **Row 1**: [32, 32, 128, 0] → merge 32s into 64, resulting in [64, 128, 0, 0] (score +64).  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 0, 0, 4] → shifts left to [32, 4, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: All zeros (no change).  \n**Outcome**: Score +64.

Zeros are filled by moving tiles left, and the two `4`s merge into `8`. Result: `32|8|0|0` (score +8).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `4|0|0|0` shift left: `4|0|0|0` (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: No tiles, remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n\n**Outcome**: Merges the `4`s in Row 1, gains 8 points, and keeps larger tiles (128, 256) in the top-left corner, a strategic position.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles are all distinct and no zeros, so no change: `128|256|8|2`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `32|0|4|4` shift right.

All tiles are already as high as possible with no adjacent duplicates to merge. No tiles shift or merge. The board remains unchanged, and no score is gained.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed bottom-to-top. Tiles shift down but no adjacent duplicates merge (e.g., 128, 32, 4 in Column 0 shift down but do not merge). No score is gained, and the board structure is scattered.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the `4`s for 8 points, but LEFT keeps larger tiles (128, 256) in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for future merges).

DOWN:\n- **Effect**: Tiles shift down, merging where possible.  \n  - **Column 0**: [0,0,128,0] → [0,0,0,128] (128 moves to bottom).  \n  - **Column 1**: [0,0,32,4] → [0,0,32,4] (no shift).  \n  - **Column 2**: [0,128,256,16] → [0,128,256,16] (no shift).  \n  - **Column 3**: [0,2,2,128] → [0,0,4,128] (two 2s merge into 4, score +4).  \n- **New Board**:  \n  Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 1: 0 | 0 | 128 | 0  \n  Row 2: 0 | 32 | 256 | 4  \n  Row 3: 128 | 4 | 16 | 128  \n- **Score**: 4 (from merging two 2s).  \n\n\n### Decision:\nBoth UP and DOWN merge the two 2s (score +4). However, UP consolidates larger tiles (128, 256) in the upper rows and leaves the bottom row (Row 3) completely empty. This creates more flexibility for future moves, as new tiles (2 or 4) will spawn in the empty bottom row, minimizing interference with larger tiles. UP also positions the 128 in the top-left corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential, empty tile preservation, and strategic positioning of large tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 128|32|128|4  \nRow 1: 0|4|256|128  \nRow 2: 0|0|16|0  \nRow 3: 0|64|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: No empty tiles, so no shift.  \n- Row 1: Tiles [4, 256, 128] shift left to [4|256|128|0].  \n- Row 2: Tile [16] shifts left to [16|0|0|0].  \n- Row 3: Tile [64] shifts left to [64|0|0|0].  \n- **Result**: No merges.

Row 1 becomes `4|256|128|0`, and Row 2 becomes `4|64|16|0`. No immediate benefits; larger tiles (256, 128) remain scattered.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur. Rows remain largely unchanged, with minimal tile movement. No strategic advantage.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward. Columns are processed vertically:\n   - Column 0: `[128,0,4,0]` → `[128,4,0,0]` (no merge).\n   - Column 1: `[32,4,64,0]` → `[32,4,64,0]` (no merge).\n   - Column 2: `[128,256,16,0]` → `[128,256,16,0]` (no merge).\n   - Column 3: `[4,128,0,0]` → `[4,128,0,0]` (no merge).  \n\n   After moving UP, the board becomes:\n   ```\n   Row 0: 128|32|128|4\n   Row 1: 4|4|256|128  \/\/ Key change: Two 4s in Row 1, Columns 0 and 1 (adjacent horizontally)\n   Row 2: 0|64|16|0\n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0\n   ```\n   This creates adjacent 4s in Row 1, which can be merged in the next move (e.g., LEFT), setting up future scoring.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward. Columns are processed vertically, but no merges occur. The board fills Row 3 with smaller tiles, reducing empty spaces and limiting future flexibility. Larger tiles (256, 128) are scattered, with no clear alignment for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving **UP** is optimal because it aligns two 4s in Row 1 (adjacent horizontally), creating a merge opportunity in the next move (e.g., LEFT). This setup maximizes future scoring potential while preserving empty spaces in Row 3 for flexibility.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate potential merges, score gains, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 128 | 4  \nRow 1: 4 | 4 | 256 | 128  \nRow 2: 0 | 64 | 16 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 128 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [128, 32, 128, 4] have no adjacent equal values, so they remain unchanged.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [4, 4, 256, 128] have two adjacent 4s, which merge into 8. The row becomes [8, 256, 128, 0], adding 8 points.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [0, 64, 16, 0] shift left to [64, 16, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [0, 0, 128, 0] shift left to [128, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n\n**Key Insight**: After a LEFT move, column 2 (third column) becomes [128 (row0), 128 (row1), 0 (row2), 0 (row3)]. This sets up a potential merge of the two 128s in column 2 on the next move (e.g., a subsequent UP swipe would merge them into 256, yielding 256 points).  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [128, 32, 128, 4] have no adjacent equal values, so they remain unchanged.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [4, 4, 256, 128] have two adjacent 4s, which merge into 8. The row becomes [0, 128, 256, 8], adding 8 points.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [0, 64, 16, 0] shift right to [0, 0, 64, 16] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [0, 0, 128, 0] shift right to [0, 0, 0, 128] (no merges).  \n\n**Key Insight**: While RIGHT also merges the 4s, it does not set up a clear follow-up merge for larger tiles (e.g., 128s). The 256 remains isolated, and no adjacent large tiles are positioned for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed top to bottom. No adjacent equal tiles are found in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles only shift up, but no score is gained.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed bottom to top. No adjacent equal tiles are found in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles only shift down, but no score is gained.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the 4s in row 1 (gaining 8 points). However, LEFT strategically positions two 128s in column 2, creating a high-value merge opportunity (256) in the next move. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and working toward higher merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN), focusing on merging tiles to maximize score and strategic positioning.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 128 | 4  \nRow 1: 8 | 256 | 128 | 0  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 16 | 0  \nRow 3: 128 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- Row 0: Tiles [128, 32, 128, 4] have no adjacent duplicates; no merge.  \n- Row 1: Tiles [8, 256, 128, 0] shift left but no duplicates; no merge.  \n- Row 2: Tiles [64, 16, 16, 0] merge 16+16=32 (score +32).  \n- Row 3: Tiles [128, 0, 0, 0] shift left; no merge.  \n**Total Score**: 32.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Row 0: Tiles [128, 32, 128, 4] have no adjacent duplicates; no merge.  \n- Row 1: Tiles [8, 256, 128, 0] shift right; no merge.  \n- Row 2: Tiles [64, 16, 16, 0] merge 16+16=32 (score +32).  \n- Row 3: Tiles [128, 0, 0, 0] shift right; no merge.  \n**Total Score**: 32.  \n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Column 0: [128, 8, 64, 128] has no duplicates; no merge.  \n- Column 1: [32, 256, 16, 0] shifts up; no merge.  \n- Column 2: [128, 128, 16, 0] merges 128+128=256 (score +256).

These pairs of equal numbers create opportunities for future merges (e.g., swiping left or right in the next move to align and merge them). This setup is critical for maximizing future scores.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile no immediate merges occur in any direction, the **down swipe** positions tiles to enable future merges (e.g., the 32s in Row 1 and 64s in Row 3), making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

A subsequent UP swipe could merge these 64s into 128 (score +128), leveraging the left column for strategic stacking.  \n- Larger tiles (128 in row 2, column 0) are already in the top-left corner, and LEFT swipe reinforces this corner for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities, tile arrangement, and strategic goals (e.g., consolidating large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|0|0\nRow 1: 64|0|0|4\nRow 2: 128|8|512|16\nRow 3: 64|4|64|128\n```\nKey observations:\n- Large tiles (512, 128, 64) are scattered but not yet merged.\n- Many empty tiles (0s) in Rows 0 and 1, providing flexibility for movement.\n- No immediate horizontal or vertical merges in the current state (no adjacent equal tiles).\n\n### Evaluation of Directions:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [8,0,0,0] → [8,0,0,0] (no change).  \n   - Row 1: [64,0,0,4] → [64,4,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [128,8,512,16] → [128,8,512,16] (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: [64,4,64,128] → [64,4,64,128] (no merge).  \n   - **Result**: No merges; tiles shift left but remain unmerged.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [8,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,8] (no change).  \n   - Row 1: [64,0,0,4] → [0,0,64,4] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [128,8,512,16] → [128,8,512,16] (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: [64,4,64,128] → [64,4,64,128] (no merge).  \n   - **Result**: No merges; tiles shift right but remain unmerged.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed vertically, but tiles are already as far down as possible.  \n   - No tiles merge, and the board remains unchanged.  \n   - **Result**: No merges; no meaningful movement.\n\n4. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed vertically, shifting tiles upward into empty spaces:  \n     - Column 0: [8,64,128,64] → [8,64,128,64] (no merge).  \n     - Column 1: [0,0,8,4] → [8,4,0,0] (tiles shift up).  \n     - Column 2: [0,0,512,64] → [512,64,0,0] (tiles shift up).  \n     - Column 3: [0,4,16,128] → [4,16,128,0] (tiles shift up).  \n   - New board after UP:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 8|8|512|4  \n     Row 1: 64|4|64|16  \n     Row 2: 128|0|0|128  \n     Row 3: 64|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - **Strategic Value**: This consolidates tiles upward, creating empty spaces in lower rows. The 128s in Row 2 (Columns 0 and 3) and 8s in Row 0 (Columns 0 and 1) are now positioned to merge in future moves (e.g., swiping LEFT next could merge the 128s or 8s).\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move, as it consolidates tiles, creates empty spaces for future flexibility, and positions tiles for potential merges in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, score gain, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 8 | 512 | 4\nRow 1: 64 | 4 | 64 | 16\nRow 2: 128 | 0 | 64 | 128\nRow 3: 64 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: 8 and 8 merge into 16 (score +16). The row becomes `16 | 512 | 4 | 0`.\n- **Row 1**: No merges (tiles are `64 | 4 | 64 | 16`).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left to `128 | 64 | 128 | 0` (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left to `64 | 0 | 0 | 0` (no merges).  \n**Total Score**: 16.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: 8 and 8 merge into 16 (score +16). The row becomes `0 | 16 | 512 | 4`.\n- **Row 1**: No merges (tiles remain `64 | 4 | 64 | 16`).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right to `0 | 128 | 64 | 128` (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right to `0 | 0 | 0 | 64` (no merges).  \n**Total Score**: 16.\n\n### UP Move:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles `8 | 64 | 128 | 64` (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: Tiles `8 | 4 | 0 | 0` (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: Tiles `512 | 64 | 64 | 0` (64 and 64 merge into 128, score +128). The column becomes `512 | 128 | 0 | 0`.\n- **Column 3**: Tiles `4 | 16 | 128 | 0` (no merges).  \n**Total Score**: 128.  \nAfter the move, the board becomes:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 8 | 512 | 4\nRow 1: 64 | 4 | 128 | 16\nRow 2: 128 | 0 | 0 | 128\nRow 3: 64 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\nThis positions 128s in Row 2 (columns 0 and 3), which can merge in future moves (e.g., a subsequent LEFT move would merge them into 256). The 512 remains in the top row, maintaining a corner focus.\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles `8 | 64 | 128 | 64` (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: Tiles `8 | 4 | 0 | 0` (shift down to `0 | 0 | 8 | 4`).\n- **Column 2**: Tiles `512 | 64 | 64 | 0` (64 and 64 merge into 128, score +128). The column becomes `512 | 0 | 0 | 128`.\n- **Column 3**: Tiles `4 | 16 | 128 | 0` (shift down to `0 | 128 | 16 | 4`).  \n**Total Score**: 128.  \nAfter the move, the board is more scattered, with 128s in non-adjacent positions, reducing future merge potential.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP and DOWN both yield 128 points, but UP better positions the board for future merges (e.g., 128s in Row 2 can merge with a LEFT move). Additionally, UP keeps the 512 in the top row, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 8 | 512 | 4  \nRow 1: 64 | 4 | 128 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 0 | 0 | 128  \nRow 3: 64 | 0 | 2 | 0  \n\n\n### **LEFT Swipe Analysis**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [8, 8, 512, 4] shift left. The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in [16, 512, 4, 0].  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [64, 4, 128, 16] have no merges (distinct values), so they remain [64, 4, 128, 16].  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [128, 0, 0, 128] shift left. The two 128s merge into 256 (score +256), resulting in [256, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [64, 0, 2, 0] shift left to [64, 2, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n\n**Total Score**: 16 + 256 = 272.  \n**Resulting Board After LEFT**:  \nRow 0: 16 | 512 | 4 | 0  \nRow 1: 64 | 4 | 128 | 16  \nRow 2: 256 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 64 | 2 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### **RIGHT Swipe Analysis**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [8, 8, 512, 4] shift right. The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in [0, 16, 512, 4].  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [64, 4, 128, 16] have no merges, so they remain [64, 4, 128, 16].  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [128, 0, 0, 128] shift right. The two 128s merge into 256 (score +256), resulting in [0, 0, 0, 256].  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [64, 0, 2, 0] shift right to [0, 0, 64, 2] (no merges).  \n\n**Total Score**: 16 + 256 = 272.  \n**Resulting Board After RIGHT**:  \nRow 0: 0 | 16 | 512 | 4  \nRow 1: 64 | 4 | 128 | 16  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 256  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 64 | 2  \n\n\n### **UP\/DOWN Swipe Analysis**  \n- **UP Swipe**: No merges occur because columns have distinct values or no adjacent duplicates. Tiles shift up but generate no score.  \n- **DOWN Swipe**: Tiles shift down, but no merges occur (columns lack adjacent duplicates). No score is generated.  \n\n\n### **Decision**  \nBoth LEFT and RIGHT swipes yield the same score (272). However, RIGHT is preferable because it positions the merged 256 tile in the bottom-right corner (row 2, column 3), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners. This setup helps maintain a stable structure for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. The goal is to identify which direction maximizes future merging opportunities and strategically positions larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|16|512|4\nRow 1: 64|4|128|16\nRow 2: 4|0|0|256\nRow 3: 0|0|64|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct).  \n   - Resulting board has scattered tiles with no immediate merging opportunities.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct).  \n   - Resulting board maintains the same structure with no new merging potential.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom, shifting tiles upward.  \n   - **Column 0**: [0, 64, 4, 0] → [64, 4, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - **Column 1**: [16, 4, 0, 0] → [16, 4, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - **Column 2**: [512, 128, 0, 64] → [512, 128, 64, 0] (no merge).  \n   - **Column 3**: [4, 16, 256, 2] → [4, 16, 256, 2] (no merge).  \n   - **Key Outcome**: Row 1 becomes `4|4|128|16`, creating two adjacent 4s. This sets up an immediate merge opportunity (swiping LEFT next would merge these 4s into 8, adding to the score).  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom to top, shifting tiles downward.  \n   - **Column 0**: [0, 64, 4, 0] → [0, 0, 64, 4] (no merge).  \n   - **Column 1**: [16, 4, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 16, 4] (no merge).  \n   - **Column 2**: [512, 128, 0, 64] → [0, 512, 128, 64] (no merge).  \n   - **Column 3**: [4, 16, 256, 2] → [4, 16, 256, 2] (no merge).  \n   - **Key Outcome**: Row 3 becomes `4|4|64|2`, creating two adjacent 4s. However, the 512 tile (a large tile) moves to row 1, which is less strategic than keeping it in row 0.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping UP is optimal because it positions the 512 tile in row 0 (a safer, higher row) and creates an immediate merging opportunity (two 4s in row 1). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners\/upper rows and setting up future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

No merges occur, and tiles remain mostly unchanged.  \n  Example: Row 1 (0|8|128|16) becomes 8|128|16|0, with no merges.  \n  **Outcome**: No merges, minimal movement.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- All rows are compressed right, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row.

While no merges occur immediately, this sets up potential future merges (e.g., 16s in row 1 and 3 of column 1).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN swipe creates the most meaningful movement, clears space, and positions larger tiles advantageously. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate merging opportunities, score gains, and tile positioning.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|512|4\nRow 1: 0|16|128|16\nRow 2: 8|8|64|256\nRow 3: 64|16|4|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [0,0,512,4] shift left to [512,4,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [0,16,128,16] shift left to [16,128,16,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [8,8,64,256] merge 8+8=16, resulting in [16,64,256,0] (score +16).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [64,16,4,2] shift left (no merges).  \n**Total Score Gain**: 16.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [0,0,512,4] shift right (no change, no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [0,16,128,16] shift right (no change, no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [8,8,64,256] merge 8+8=16, resulting in [0,16,64,256] (score +16).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [64,16,4,2] shift right (no merges).  \n**Total Score Gain**: 16.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles [0,0,8,64] shift up to [8,64,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles [0,16,8,16] shift up to [16,8,16,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles [512,128,64,4] shift up (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles [4,16,256,2] shift up (no merges).  \n**Total Score Gain**: 0.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles [0,0,8,64] shift down (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles [0,16,8,16] shift down to [0,8,16,16], then merge 16+16=32, resulting in [0,8,0,32] (score +32).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles [512,128,64,4] shift down (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles [4,16,256,2] shift down (no merges).  \n**Total Score Gain**: 32.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nDOWN provides the highest score gain (32) by merging two 16s into 32. This is better than LEFT\/RIGHT (16 each) and UP (0). Additionally, merging larger tiles (16s) strategically supports building higher tiles in the grid.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize merges, score, and strategically position larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 0 | 512 | 4\nRow 1: 0 | 16 | 128 | 16\nRow 2: 8 | 8 | 64 | 256\nRow 3: 64 | 16 | 4 | 2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **UP Move**:\n- Columns are processed top to bottom. No adjacent equal tiles are found in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles shift up but do not combine.  \n- **Result**: No merges, minimal benefit.\n\n#### **DOWN Move**:\n- Columns are processed bottom to top. No adjacent equal tiles are found in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles shift down but do not combine.  \n- **Result**: No merges, minimal benefit.\n\n#### **LEFT Move**:\n- Each row is processed leftward. Only Row 2 has adjacent equal tiles (8 and 8), which merge into 16 (score +16). Other rows shift left but have no merges.  \n- **Result**: Merges 8+8=16 (score +16). Larger tiles (e.g., 256 in Row 2, Column 2) are not positioned in a corner.\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- Each row is processed rightward. Only Row 2 has adjacent equal tiles (8 and 8), which merge into 16 (score +16). Other rows shift right but have no merges.  \n- **Key Benefit**: After merging, the 256 tile in Row 2 shifts to the bottom-right corner (Row 2, Column 3), a strategic position to avoid disruption. Larger tiles (512, 128) also align toward the right, supporting future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT is optimal because it merges tiles (8+8=16) and positions the 256 tile in the bottom-right corner, a critical strategy for long-term progress.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN, considering tile merging, score gain, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|128|512|4\nRow 1: 32|16|128|16\nRow 2: 0|16|64|256\nRow 3: 64|16|4|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles). Empty spaces appear in Row 0 (column 3) and Row 2 (column 3).  \n   - Score gain: 0.  \n   - No strategic advantage; tiles remain scattered.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles cannot shift right (no empty spaces to the right of non-zero tiles) and no merges occur.  \n   - Invalid move (no tiles move or merge).  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed vertically. In Column 1 (values: 128, 16, 16, 16), the two 16s in Rows 1 and 2 merge into 32 (score +32). Other columns have no merges.  \n   - Resulting board has 16 in Row 2 (column 1) and empty spaces in lower rows. Larger tiles (e.g., 64) are moved to upper rows, which contradicts the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed vertically. In Column 1 (values: 128, 16, 16, 16), the two 16s in Rows 2 and 3 merge into 32 (score +32). Other columns have no merges.  \n   - Larger tiles (e.g., 64 in Row 3, column 0; 32 in Row 3, column 1) remain in the bottom row, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners. Additionally, this move positions tiles to potentially merge 128s in future moves.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe DOWN swipe merges tiles for a score gain, keeps larger tiles in the bottom row (strategically favorable), and sets up potential future merges. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic positioning of large tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: [0, 0, 512, 4]  \nRow 1: [8, 128, 128, 16]  \nRow 2: [32, 16, 64, 256]  \nRow 3: [64, 32, 4, 2]  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **1. Swipe LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0, 0, 512, 4] → Shifts left to [512, 4, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [8, 128, 128, 16] → The two 128s merge into 256, resulting in [8, 256, 16, 0] (gains 256 points).  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 16, 64, 256] → No merges (all distinct), remains [32, 16, 64, 256].  \n- **Row 3**: [64, 32, 4, 2] → No merges (all distinct), remains [64, 32, 4, 2].  \n\n**Outcome**: Merges 128s into 256, moves 512 to the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and maintains larger tiles (256 in row 2, column 3) in corners.\n\n\n#### **2. Swipe RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0, 0, 512, 4] → No shifts (already right-aligned), remains [0, 0, 512, 4] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [8, 128, 128, 16] → The two 128s merge into 256, resulting in [0, 8, 256, 16] (gains 256 points).  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 16, 64, 256] → No merges (all distinct), remains [32, 16, 64, 256].  \n- **Row 3**: [64, 32, 4, 2] → No merges (all distinct), remains [64, 32, 4, 2].  \n\n**Outcome**: Merges 128s into 256, but 512 stays in row 0, column 2 (not a corner), reducing strategic positioning.\n\n\n#### **3. Swipe UP**  \n- **Columns 0-3**: All columns have distinct values. Tiles shift up but no merges occur.  \n**Outcome**: No merges, minimal strategic benefit.\n\n\n#### **4. Swipe DOWN**  \n- **Columns 0-3**: All columns have distinct values. Tiles shift down but no merges occur.  \n**Outcome**: No merges, minimal strategic benefit.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT is the best move. It merges the 128s in row 1 to gain 256 points and positions the largest tile (512) in the top-left corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential, tile alignment, and strategic corner positioning of large tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 512 | 4 | 64 | 0\nRow 1: 8 | 256 | 16 | 0\nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 64 | 256\nRow 3: 64 | 32 | 4 | 2\n```\nKey observations:\n- No adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value, so no immediate merges are possible for any direction.\n- The largest tile (512) is in the top-left corner (0,0), and there are two 256 tiles (at (1,1) and (2,3)).\n- Strategic goals include keeping large tiles in corners and maintaining flexibility for future merges.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**: \n   - Swiping LEFT or RIGHT does not merge any tiles (no adjacent equal values) and only shifts tiles to the left\/right edge. This leaves the board structure largely unchanged, with empty tiles remaining in the same positions. These moves do not improve the alignment of large tiles.\n\n2. **DOWN**: \n   - Swiping DOWN shifts tiles downward, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal values). The 256 at (2,3) (bottom-right corner) remains in place, but other large tiles (e.g., 512 at (0,0)) are unaffected. This does not enhance corner alignment of large tiles.\n\n3. **UP**: \n   - Swiping UP shifts tiles upward. While no merges occur, the 256 at (2,3) (originally in column 3, row 2) moves up to (0,3) (top-right corner). This positions two large tiles (512 at (0,0) and 256 at (0,3)) in opposite corners of the top row, which is strategically valuable for future merges and maintaining corner dominance. Empty tiles after the move (rows 2 and 3, column 3) also provide flexibility for new tile placement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move as it aligns large tiles (512 and 256) in opposite corners of the top row, a key strategic position for future merges and maintaining board control.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game board and rules, focusing on valid moves (tiles merging or moving into empty spaces) and strategic placement of large tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 512 | 4 | 64 | 256\nRow 1: 8 | 256 | 16 | 2\nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 64 | 32\nRow 3: 64 | 32 | 4 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- All rows have no adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to shift into (row 3 has a 0, but tiles are already leftmost). No tiles move or merge. **Invalid move**.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 3**: [64, 32, 4, 0] shifts right, moving tiles to [0, 64, 32, 4] (valid movement into the empty space).  \n- Other rows have no adjacent equal tiles and no empty spaces to shift into, so they remain unchanged.  \n- **Valid move**: Tiles in row 3 shift right into the empty space.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- All columns have no adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to shift into (column 3 has a 0, but tiles are already topmost). No tiles move or merge. **Invalid move**.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 3**: [256, 2, 32, 0] shifts down, moving tiles to [0, 256, 2, 32] (valid movement into the empty space).  \n- Other columns have no adjacent equal tiles and no empty spaces to shift into, so they remain unchanged.  \n- **Valid move**: Tiles in column 3 shift down into the empty space.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:  \nThe goal is to keep large tiles in corners. The largest tiles are 512 (top-left corner, row 0, column 0) and 256 (top-right corner, row 0, column 3). Swiping RIGHT leaves the 256 in its top-right corner, preserving this strategic position. Swiping DOWN moves the 256 from the top-right corner to row 1, column 3 (no longer a corner), which is less optimal. Thus, RIGHT is better for maintaining large tiles in corners.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible merges and strategic positioning for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is full (no empty tiles), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value to merge.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 512 | 4 | 64 | 256  \nRow 1: 8 | 256 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 64 | 32  \nRow 3: 128 | 64 | 32 | 4  \n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: All tiles (512, 4, 64, 256) are distinct. No merges.  \n- **Row 1**: All tiles (8, 256, 16, 2) are distinct. No merges.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (32, 16, 64, 32) are distinct. No adjacent matches.

No merges.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (4, 256, 16, 64) are distinct. No merges.  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles (64, 16, 64, 32) include two 64s, but they are not adjacent (separated by 16). No merges.  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles (256, 2, 32, 4) are distinct. No merges.  \n**Result**: No merges.  \n\n### DOWN Move:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles (512, 8, 32, 128) are distinct. No merges.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (4, 256, 16, 64) are distinct. No merges.  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles (64, 16, 64, 32) include two 64s, but they are not adjacent (separated by 16). No merges.  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles (256, 2, 32, 4) are distinct. No merges.  \n**Result**: No merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent tiles of the same value in any direction, meaning no valid merges. However, since the problem requires selecting a direction, the choice is based on strategic positioning. Keeping the largest tile (512) in the top-left corner (Row 0, Column 0) is a common strategy, and UP aligns with maintaining this corner.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile alignment. The grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value to merge.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 512 | 4 | 64 | 256  \nRow 1: 8 | 256 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 64 | 32  \nRow 3: 128 | 64 | 32 | 4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. For example:  \n   - Row 0: 512, 4, 64, 256 (all distinct).  \n   - Row 1: 8, 256, 16, 2 (all distinct).  \n   - Row 2: 32, 16, 64, 32 (32s are not adjacent).  \n   - Row 3: 128, 64, 32, 4 (all distinct).  \n   No merges occur; the grid remains unchanged.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Similar to LEFT, all rows have no adjacent equal tiles. For example:  \n   - Row 0: 512, 4, 64, 256 (all distinct).  \n   - Row 1: 8, 256, 16, 2 (all distinct).  \n   - Row 2: 32, 16, 64, 32 (32s are not adjacent).  \n   - Row 3: 128, 64, 32, 4 (all distinct).  \n   No merges occur; the grid remains unchanged.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   All columns have no adjacent equal tiles. For example:  \n   - Column 0: 512, 8, 32, 128 (all distinct).  \n   - Column 1: 4, 256, 16, 64 (all distinct).  \n   - Column 2: 64, 16, 64, 32 (64s are not adjacent).  \n   - Column 3: 256, 2, 32, 4 (all distinct).  \n   No merges occur; the grid remains unchanged.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   All columns have no adjacent equal tiles.

Thus, no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, a default choice is made.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile placement. The grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value to merge. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 512 | 4 | 64 | 256  \nRow 1: 8 | 256 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 64 | 32  \nRow 3: 128 | 64 | 32 | 4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   - All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 0 (512, 4, 64, 256) and Row 1 (8, 256, 16, 2) have no duplicates. Row 2 (32, 16, 64, 32) has 32s but they are not adjacent. Row 3 (128, 64, 32, 4) has no duplicates. No merges occur.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - Similar to LEFT, no rows have adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 0 and Row 1 remain unchanged. Row 2’s 32s are not adjacent when shifted right. Row 3 has no duplicates. No merges occur.  \n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   - Columns are checked for vertical merges. Column 0 (512, 8, 32, 128), Column 1 (4, 256, 16, 64), and Column 3 (256, 2, 32, 4) have no duplicates. Column 2 (64, 16, 64, 32) has 64s but they are separated by 16 (non-adjacent). No merges occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   - Columns are checked for vertical merges. Column 0, Column 1, and Column 3 have no duplicates. Column 2’s 64s are still non-adjacent when shifted down. No merges occur.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent equal tiles, meaning no merges are possible in any direction. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four moves.

Tiles cannot merge or shift left (no empty spaces), so no valid merges or movement.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Similarly, all rows have distinct non-zero tiles with no adjacent duplicates.

No merges or shifts occur. **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   All rows are full, and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal (when processed right-to-left). No merges or shifts occur. **Invalid move**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   All columns are full, and no adjacent tiles in any column are equal (when processed top-to-bottom). No merges or shifts occur. **Invalid move**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Columns are processed bottom-to-top. In Column 2 (values: 64, 16, 64, 32), the two 64s (at row 0 and row 2) are vertically aligned. When swiping DOWN:  \n   - The 64 in row 0 shifts down past the 16 in row 1 and merges with the 64 in row 2, forming a 128.  \n   - This merge is valid, as merged tiles do not combine again in the same move.  \n   - The merged 128 adds 128 to the score, and the grid gains an empty tile (row 0, column 2).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly swiping DOWN results in a valid merge (64 + 64 = 128) and creates an empty tile. All other directions are invalid due to no merges or shifts.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merges and movement validity. A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or moving tiles into empty spaces.

However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four options, any direction is technically acceptable (though the game would end due to no valid moves).  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate potential merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 512 | 4 | 64 | 256\nRow 1: 8 | 256 | 16 | 2\nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 64 | 32\nRow 3: 128 | 64 | 32 | 4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   All rows are fully occupied with distinct numbers. No adjacent tiles can merge, and no tiles can shift left (since no empty spaces). No merges occur.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Similarly, all rows are fully occupied with distinct numbers. No adjacent tiles can merge, and no tiles can shift right (since no empty spaces). No merges occur.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   We analyze columns for potential merges:  \n   - **Column 0**: [512, 8, 32, 128] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - **Column 1**: [4, 256, 16, 64] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - **Column 2**: [64, 16, 64, 32]. Here, the top (64 at Row 0) and middle (64 at Row 2) tiles are identical. When swiping up, these 64s merge into 128, generating a score of 128. The remaining tiles (16 at Row 1 and 32 at Row 3) shift up to fill empty spaces.  \n   - **Column 3**: [256, 2, 32, 4] (all distinct, no merges).  \n\n   The UP swipe results in a merge of two 64s into 128, which is beneficial for scoring.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   All columns are fully occupied with distinct numbers. No adjacent tiles can merge, and no tiles can shift down (since no empty spaces). No merges occur.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe is the only direction that triggers a merge (64 + 64 → 128), generating a score and maintaining strategic positioning of larger tiles (e.g., 512 remains in the top-left corner).  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement and merging potential.

Shifting left would not change tile positions because there are no empty spaces to fill. No adjacent tiles in any row are equal, so no merges occur.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Similarly, all rows are full. Shifting right would not alter tile positions, as there are no empty spaces. No adjacent tiles in any row are equal, so no merges occur.  \n3. **UP**: All columns are full (no 0s).

For example:\n   - Row 0: 512, 4, 64, 256 (all distinct).\n   - Row 1: 8, 256, 16, 2 (all distinct).\n   - Row 2: 32, 16, 64, 32 (32s are separated by 16 and 64, not adjacent).\n   - Row 3: 128, 64, 32, 4 (all distinct).\n   - Columns: All columns also lack adjacent duplicates (e.g., column 2 has 64, 16, 64, 32, but the 64s are separated by 16).\n\n2. **Grid is Full**: There are no empty tiles (0s). A valid move requires either adjacent merges or empty spaces to shift tiles. Since the grid is full and no adjacent merges are possible, all moves are technically invalid. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.\n\n3. **Strategic Placement**: The largest tile (512) is in the top-left corner (row 0, column 0). To maintain strategic positioning (keeping large tiles in corners), moves that preserve this position are preferred. Swiping LEFT keeps the 512 in the top-left corner and does not disrupt the existing tile arrangement, as no merges or shifts occur (grid is full).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThough all moves are invalid due to the full grid and lack of adjacent merges, LEFT is chosen to maintain the largest tile in the corner and avoid unnecessary disruption.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board for possible merges or shifts in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

Thus, no merges are possible in any direction. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we choose based on strategic positioning (e.g., keeping larger tiles in corners).

The grid has no empty tiles (all values are non-zero), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number to merge.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 512 | 4 | 64 | 256  \nRow 1: 8 | 256 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 64 | 32  \nRow 3: 128 | 64 | 32 | 4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows have unique adjacent tiles (no duplicates). For example:  \n     - Row 0: 512, 4, 64, 256 (no merges).  \n     - Row 1: 8, 256, 16, 2 (no merges).  \n     - Row 2: 32, 16, 64, 32 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n     - Row 3: 128, 64, 32, 4 (no merges).  \n   - No tiles merge or shift; the grid remains unchanged.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows have unique adjacent tiles (no duplicates). For example:  \n     - Row 0: 512, 4, 64, 256 (no merges).  \n     - Row 1: 8, 256, 16, 2 (no merges).  \n     - Row 2: 32, 16, 64, 32 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n     - Row 3: 128, 64, 32, 4 (no merges).  \n   - No tiles merge or shift; the grid remains unchanged.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - All columns have unique adjacent tiles (no duplicates). For example:  \n     - Column 0: 512, 8, 32, 128 (no merges).  \n     - Column 1: 4, 256, 16, 64 (no merges).  \n     - Column 2: 64, 16, 64, 32 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n     - Column 3: 256, 2, 32, 4 (no merges).  \n   - No tiles merge or shift; the grid remains unchanged.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - All columns have unique adjacent tiles (no duplicates). For example:  \n     - Column 0: 512, 8, 32, 128 (no merges).  \n     - Column 1: 4, 256, 16, 64 (no merges).  \n     - Column 2: 64, 16, 64, 32 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n     - Column 3: 256, 2, 32, 4 (no merges).  \n   - No tiles merge or shift; the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe grid is full (no empty tiles), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number. Thus, no valid moves exist to merge tiles or shift them into empty spaces. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid moves, any direction is technically invalid, but we choose arbitrarily.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or tile movements in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same value to merge.\n\n### Current Grid:\n```\nRow 0: 512 | 4 | 64 | 256  \nRow 1: 8 | 256 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 64 | 32  \nRow 3: 128 | 64 | 32 | 4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   All rows have distinct adjacent values (no duplicates). For example, Row 0: `512, 4, 64, 256` (no merges). Similarly, Rows 1, 2, 3 have no adjacent duplicates. No tiles can merge or shift left (grid is full). **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   All rows have distinct adjacent values. For example, Row 2: `32, 16, 64, 32`—the two 32s are not adjacent, so no merge. Other rows also lack adjacent duplicates. No tiles can merge or shift right (grid is full). **Invalid move**.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   All columns have distinct adjacent values. For example, Column 2: `64, 16, 64, 32`—the two 64s are separated by a row, so no merge. Other columns also lack adjacent duplicates. No tiles can merge or shift up (grid is full). **Invalid move**.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   All columns have distinct adjacent values. For example, Column 2: `64, 16, 64, 32`—the two 64s are not adjacent, so no merge. Other columns also lack adjacent duplicates. No tiles can merge or shift down (grid is full). **Invalid move**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent tiles have the same value. All directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are invalid. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four, we arbitrarily choose based on the lack of a better option.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. The goal is to identify if any direction allows tiles to merge or shift into empty spaces (though the grid is currently full with no zeros).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current grid has no empty tiles (all 16 tiles are non-zero). For a move to be valid, there must either be adjacent tiles with the same number (to merge) or empty spaces (to shift tiles into). Since there are no empty spaces, we check for adjacent tiles with the same number:\n\n- **Horizontal Adjacents (same row):** All rows have distinct adjacent tiles (e.g., Row 0: 512, 4, 64, 256; Row 1: 8, 256, 16, 2; Row 2: 32, 16, 64, 32; Row 3: 128, 64, 32, 4). No merges possible here.\n- **Vertical Adjacents (same column):** All columns have distinct adjacent tiles (e.g., Column 0: 512, 8, 32, 128; Column 1: 4, 256, 16, 64; Column 2: 64, 16, 64, 32; Column 3: 256, 2, 32, 4). No merges possible here.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT:** Since all rows are full and have no adjacent duplicates, shifting left or right does not change the grid (no tiles merge or shift into empty spaces).\n- **UP\/DOWN:** Similarly, all columns are full and have no adjacent duplicates, so shifting up or down also does not change the grid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent tiles to merge, meaning no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we choose based on strategic considerations (e.g., aligning larger tiles for potential future merges). Here, moving **UP** is selected as a tentative choice, though no immediate merges occur.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the validity of swiping left, right, up, or down based on the game rules. A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or moving tiles into empty spaces. The current grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves depend solely on merging potential.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe grid is fully occupied (no zeros), and all tiles are listed below:\n```\nRow 0: 512 | 4 | 64 | 256  \nRow 1: 8 | 256 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 64 | 32  \nRow 3: 128 | 64 | 32 | 4  \n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Each row is checked for adjacent tiles that can merge. All rows have distinct adjacent values (e.g., Row 0: 512, 4, 64, 256; Row 1: 8, 256, 16, 2; Row 2: 32, 16, 64, 32; Row 3: 128, 64, 32, 4). No merges are possible. Since the grid is full, no tiles can shift left. **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Similarly, all rows have distinct adjacent values when processed rightward. For example, Row 2 (32, 16, 64, 32) has no adjacent duplicates, and no tiles can shift right into empty spaces (none exist). **Invalid move**.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are checked for vertical merges. Columns 0 (512, 8, 32, 128), 1 (4, 256, 16, 64), 3 (256, 2, 32, 4) have distinct values. Column 2 (64, 16, 64, 32) has 64s in Row 0 and Row 2, but they are not adjacent (separated by 16 in Row 1). No merges occur, and no tiles can shift up into empty spaces. **Invalid move**.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are checked for vertical merges. All columns have distinct adjacent values. For example, Column 2 (64, 16, 64, 32) has non-adjacent 64s, and no other columns have merges. Tiles cannot shift down into empty spaces (none exist). **Invalid move**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are invalid because there are no adjacent tiles to merge and no empty spaces to shift tiles into. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four options. Given the lack of valid moves, any direction is technically invalid, but a default choice is required.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning. The current game board is:\n\n```\nRow 1: 512 | 4 | 64 | 256  \nRow 2: 8 | 256 | 16 | 2  \nRow 3: 32 | 16 | 64 | 32  \nRow 4: 128 | 64 | 32 | 4  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles (0s):** All 16 tiles are occupied, so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same value to merge.  \n- **Adjacent tile check:** We check horizontally (same row) and vertically (same column) for pairs of equal values:  \n  - **Horizontal:** No adjacent equal tiles in any row (e.g., Row 1: 512, 4, 64, 256 are all distinct; Row 3: 32, 16, 64, 32 are separated by other values).  \n  - **Vertical:** No adjacent equal tiles in any column (e.g., Column 3: 64 (Row 1), 16 (Row 2), 64 (Row 3), 32 (Row 4) has 64s separated by 16).  \n\n### Evaluation of Directions:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT:** Since all tiles are filled and no adjacent equal tiles exist, swiping left or right will not merge any tiles. Tiles cannot shift because there are no empty spaces.  \n- **UP\/DOWN:** Similarly, swiping up or down will not merge any tiles, as no adjacent equal tiles exist vertically, and no empty spaces allow tile movement.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent equal tiles, meaning no valid moves exist. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of merges, any direction is technically invalid, but we must choose per the problem constraints.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\nRow 0: 512 | 4 | 64 | 256  \nRow 1: 8 | 256 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 64 | 32  \nRow 3: 128 | 64 | 32 | 4  \n\n### LEFT and RIGHT Swipes:\n- **LEFT**: All rows are fully occupied with distinct numbers.

When shifting up, the 64 in Row 2 moves up past 16 (Row 1) to Row 1, making Row 0 and Row 1 both 64. These two 64s merge into 128, scoring 128 points. The merged tile occupies Row 0, and the remaining tiles (16, 32) shift up, leaving Row 3 empty.  \n- Column 3: 256, 2, 32, 4 (all distinct, no merges).  \n\nThe UP swipe results in a merge of two 64s into 128, creating a higher-value tile and scoring points.

The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 512 | 4 | 64 | 256  \nRow 1: 8 | 256 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 64 | 32  \nRow 3: 128 | 64 | 32 | 4  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles, `0`), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same value (since no empty spaces exist to shift into).\n- We check all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) for adjacent equal tiles that can merge:\n\n#### LEFT\/RIGHT (Row-wise):\n- **Row 0**: `512, 4, 64, 256` (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n- **Row 1**: `8, 256, 16, 2` (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n- **Row 2**: `32, 16, 64, 32` (32s are separated by 16 and 64, not adjacent).  \n- **Row 3**: `128, 64, 32, 4` (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n\nNo merges possible in LEFT or RIGHT directions.\n\n#### UP\/DOWN (Column-wise):\n- **Column 0**: `512, 8, 32, 128` (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n- **Column 1**: `4, 256, 16, 64` (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n- **Column 2**: `64, 16, 64, 32` (64s are separated by 16, not adjacent).  \n- **Column 3**: `256, 2, 32, 4` (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n\nNo merges possible in UP or DOWN directions either.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent equal tiles in any direction, meaning no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, a strategic choice (e.g., UP) is made to potentially set up future merges, though no immediate merges occur.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and check for valid merges or shifts in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). A valid move requires either adjacent tiles with the same number (to merge) or empty spaces (to shift tiles). The current grid has no empty tiles (all cells are non-zero), so valid moves depend solely on merging adjacent equal tiles.\n\n### Grid Analysis:\nThe game board is:\n```\nRow 0: 512 | 4 | 64 | 256  \nRow 1: 8 | 256 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 64 | 32  \nRow 3: 128 | 64 | 32 | 4  \n```\n\n### Checking Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT Moves**:  \n   For horizontal moves (LEFT\/RIGHT), we check each row for adjacent equal tiles. All rows have distinct values (no two adjacent tiles are the same). For example:  \n   - Row 0: 512, 4, 64, 256 (all distinct).  \n   - Row 1: 8, 256, 16, 2 (all distinct).  \n   - Row 2: 32, 16, 64, 32 (32s are not adjacent).  \n   - Row 3: 128, 64, 32, 4 (all distinct).  \n   No merges are possible in LEFT or RIGHT directions.\n\n2. **UP\/DOWN Moves**:  \n   For vertical moves (UP\/DOWN), we check each column for adjacent equal tiles. All columns also have distinct values (no two adjacent tiles are the same). For example:  \n   - Column 0: 512, 8, 32, 128 (all distinct).  \n   - Column 1: 4, 256, 16, 64 (all distinct).  \n   - Column 2: 64, 16, 64, 32 (64s are not adjacent).  \n   - Column 3: 256, 2, 32, 4 (all distinct).  \n   No merges are possible in UP or DOWN directions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full (no empty tiles), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number. By the game rules, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we default to the direction that aligns with strategic goals (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners). The largest tile (512) is already in the top-left corner, so LEFT maintains its position.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for valid moves (merging adjacent tiles or moving into empty spaces). The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value. \n\n### Current Board:\n```\nRow 0: 512 | 4 | 64 | 256  \nRow 1: 8 | 256 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 64 | 32  \nRow 3: 128 | 64 | 32 | 4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows have distinct values with no adjacent duplicates. Swiping left or right would not merge any tiles, and since the grid is full, no tiles can shift into empty spaces. These moves are invalid.  \n\n2. **UP\/DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - All columns also have distinct values with no adjacent duplicates. Swiping up or down would not merge any tiles, and the grid remains full with no empty spaces to shift into. These moves are also invalid.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. Thus, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, an arbitrary choice is made.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the validity of swiping left, right, up, or down based on the game rules. A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or moving tiles into empty spaces. The current grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves depend solely on the presence of adjacent tiles that can merge.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 512 | 4 | 64 | 256  \nRow 1: 8 | 256 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 64 | 32  \nRow 3: 128 | 64 | 32 | 4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   All rows are full (no empty tiles).

Checking for adjacent merges in each row (processed rightward):  \n   - Row 0: 512, 4, 64, 256 (all distinct).  \n   - Row 1: 8, 256, 16, 2 (all distinct).  \n   - Row 2: 32, 16, 64, 32 (32s are separated by 16 and 64; no merge).  \n   - Row 3: 128, 64, 32, 4 (all distinct).  \n   No merges or movement possible. **Invalid**.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   All columns are full. Checking for adjacent merges in each column (processed upward):  \n   - Column 0: 512, 8, 32, 128 (all distinct).  \n   - Column 1: 4, 256, 16, 64 (all distinct).  \n   - Column 2: 64, 16, 64, 32 (64s are separated by 16; no merge).  \n   - Column 3: 256, 2, 32, 4 (all distinct).  \n   No merges or movement possible. **Invalid**.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   All columns are full. Checking for adjacent merges in each column (processed downward):  \n   - Column 0: 512, 8, 32, 128 (all distinct).  \n   - Column 1: 4, 256, 16, 64 (all distinct).  \n   - Column 2: 64, 16, 64, 32 (64s are separated by 16; no merge).  \n   - Column 3: 256, 2, 32, 4 (all distinct).  \n   No merges or movement possible. **Invalid**.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent tiles of the same number, meaning no valid moves exist. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, any direction could be chosen, but based on the analysis, no direction leads to a valid move. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of merging tiles and maximizing scores.

For example:\n   - Rows: All horizontal pairs (e.g., 512 & 4, 8 & 256, 32 & 16, 128 & 64) are distinct.\n   - Columns: All vertical pairs (e.g., 512 & 8, 4 & 256, 64 & 16, 256 & 2) are also distinct.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipe**: Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are equal, shifting tiles left or right will not merge any tiles or change the board state.\n- **UP\/DOWN Swipe**: Similarly, vertical shifts will not merge tiles, as there are no adjacent equal tiles in columns.\n\n### Conclusion:\nA valid move requires either adjacent equal tiles (to merge) or empty spaces (to shift into). Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are equal, **no valid moves exist**.

Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n512|4|64|256\n8|256|16|2\n32|16|64|32\n128|64|32|4\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

No immediate merges are possible, so the goal is to position these tiles to enable future merges.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: The 2 at (0,1) shifts left to (0,0).  \n   - Row 3: The 2 at (3,3) shifts left to (3,0).  \n   - Resulting board after moving LEFT (before new tile spawn):  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 2|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 2|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - The two 2s are now in the leftmost column (column 0), rows 0 and 3. This positions them vertically aligned, making it easier to merge them in future moves (e.g., moving UP would stack them into a 4).  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: The 2 at (0,1) shifts right to (0,3).  \n   - Row 3: The 2 at (3,3) remains in place.  \n   - Resulting board after moving RIGHT (before new tile spawn):  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|0|2  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|2  \n     ```  \n   - The two 2s are in the rightmost column (column 3), rows 0 and 3. While this also aligns them vertically, the 2 in row 0, column 3 is farther from the existing 2 in row 3, column 3 compared to the LEFT move.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 1: The 2 at (0,1) stays in (0,1) (no space above to shift).  \n   - Column 3: The 2 at (3,3) shifts up to (0,3).  \n   - Resulting board after moving UP (before new tile spawn):  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|2|0|2  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - The 2s are in row 0, columns 1 and 3. They are horizontally separated by empty spaces, making future merges less straightforward.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 1: The 2 at (0,1) shifts down to (3,1).  \n   - Column 3: The 2 at (3,3) stays in place.  \n   - Resulting board after moving DOWN (before new tile spawn):  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 0|2|0|2  \n     ```  \n   - The 2s are in row 3, columns 1 and 3. They are horizontally separated by empty spaces, similar to the UP move, making future merges harder.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT positions the two 2s in the leftmost column (column 0), aligning them vertically.

The two 2s (columns 0 and 2) merge into 4, resulting in 0|0|0|4 (score +4).  \n   - Row 3: The 2 (column 0) shifts right, resulting in 0|0|0|2.  \n   - Final board (before new tile):  \n     Row 0: 0|0|0|4  \n     Rows 1-2: 0s  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|2  \n\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: The 2s in row 0 and row 3 shift up and merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in 4|0|0|0.  \n   - Column 2: The 2 in row 0 shifts up (already in the top row), resulting in 2|0|0|0.  \n   - Final board (before new tile):  \n     Row 0: 4|0|2|0  \n     Rows 1-3: 0s  \n\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: The 2s in row 0 and row 3 shift down and merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in 0|0|0|4.  \n   - Column 2: The 2 in row 0 shifts down to row 3, resulting in 0|0|0|2.  \n   - Final board (before new tile):  \n     Rows 0-2: 0s  \n     Row 3: 4|0|2|0  \n\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nThe goal is to consolidate larger tiles in a corner for future merges. Swiping UP places the merged 4 in the top-left corner (row 0, column 0) and keeps the 2 in row 0, column 2. This setup allows for potential future merges in the top row (e.g., a new 2 in row 0, column 1 could merge with the existing 2 in column 2, leading to a 4, and then merging with the 4 in column 0 for an 8). This aligns with the strategy of building larger tiles in a corner.\n\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the potential outcomes of each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to position tiles for future merges and maximize scoring opportunities.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|2|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0 tiles shift left to `4|2|0|0` (no merge).  \n   - Row 3 tiles shift left to `2|0|0|0` (no merge).  \n   - Result: Tiles are spread across rows 0 and 3 with no immediate merge potential.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0 tiles shift right to `0|0|4|2` (no merge).  \n   - Row 3 tiles remain `0|0|0|2` (no merge).  \n   - Result: Tiles are spread across the right end of rows 0 and 3 with no immediate merge potential.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns shift upward:  \n     - Column 0: `4` stays in row 0.  \n     - Column 2: `2` stays in row 0.  \n     - Column 3: `2` from row 3 shifts up to row 0.  \n   - Post-shift board: Row 0 becomes `4|0|2|2` (rows 1-3 remain empty).  \n   - Key observation: The two `2`s in row 0 (columns 2 and 3) are now adjacent horizontally. A future LEFT swipe would merge these `2`s into a `4`, creating scoring potential.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns shift downward:  \n     - Column 0: `4` from row 0 shifts down to row 3.  \n     - Column 2: `2` from row 0 shifts down to row 3.  \n     - Column 3: `2` stays in row 3.  \n   - Post-shift board: Row 3 becomes `4|0|2|2` (rows 0-2 remain empty).  \n   - Key observation: The two `2`s in row 3 (columns 2 and 3) are adjacent horizontally. A future LEFT swipe would merge these `2`s into a `4`, similar to the UP case.  \n\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nBoth UP and DOWN moves position two `2`s adjacently for future merges. However, keeping the largest tile (4) in a corner (top-left for UP) aligns with the strategic goal of consolidating large tiles in corners to facilitate controlled merging. This makes UP the better choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|0|2|2  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|2|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The 4 stays in column 0. The 2 and 2 in columns 2 and 3 merge into 4 (since they are adjacent after shifting). Result: 4|4|0|0 (score +4).  \n- **Row 1, 2**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 3**: The 2 in column 1 shifts left to column 0. Result: 2|0|0|0.  \n\nAfter LEFT, the board becomes:  \n4|4|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n2|0|0|0  \n\nThis merges two 2s into a 4, creating adjacent 4s in row 0 that could potentially merge again later. Larger tiles are concentrated on the left, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The 4 moves to column 1, and the 2 and 2 in columns 2 and 3 merge into 4 (adjacent after shifting). Result: 0|4|4|0 (score +4).  \n- **Row 1, 2**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 3**: The 2 in column 1 shifts right to column 3. Result: 0|0|0|2.  \n\nAfter RIGHT, the board becomes:  \n0|4|4|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|2  \n\nWhile this also merges two 2s, the merged 4s are in the middle of row 0, and the 2 in row 3 is isolated on the right. This is less strategic than LEFT for concentrating larger tiles.\n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Columns**: Tiles shift up. Each column has only one non-zero tile (e.g., column 0 has 4, column 1 has 2, column 2 has 2, column 3 has 2). No merges occur because no adjacent tiles are equal.  \n\nAfter UP, the board becomes:  \n4|2|2|2  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n\nNo merges, so no score. This move does not help consolidate tiles.\n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Columns**: Tiles shift down. Each column has only one non-zero tile (e.g., column 0 has 4, column 1 has 2, column 2 has 2, column 3 has 2). No merges occur because no adjacent tiles are equal.  \n\nAfter DOWN, the board becomes:  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n4|2|2|2  \n\nNo merges, so no score. This move also fails to consolidate tiles.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge two 2s into a 4, but LEFT better aligns with the strategy of concentrating larger tiles in a corner (left side). The merged 4s in row 0 are adjacent and positioned to potentially merge again, making LEFT the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging rules. The goal is to maximize score and strategically position tiles for future merges.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|4|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|2|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 2|0|0|0  \n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: The two adjacent 4s merge into 8 (score +8). The row becomes `8|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 1: The 2 shifts left to column 0, becoming `2|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 2: Remains all zeros.  \n   - Row 3: The 2 is already in column 0, so it stays: `2|0|0|0`.  \n   - Result: 8 is placed in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), with 2s aligned vertically in column 0 for potential future merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: The two 4s shift right and merge into 8 (score +8). The row becomes `0|0|0|8`.  \n   - Row 1: The 2 shifts right to column 3, becoming `0|0|0|2`.  \n   - Row 3: The 2 shifts right to column 3, becoming `0|0|0|2`.  \n   - Result: 8 is placed in the top-right corner, but 2s are aligned vertically in column 3. Less flexibility for merging compared to LEFT, as column 0 (after LEFT) has more empty space for future tiles.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed, but no merges occur (tiles in columns are non-adjacent or of different values). The board becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 4|4|2|0  \n     Row 1: 2|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - No immediate score gain, and larger tiles (4s) are spread across row 0, reducing strategic positioning.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed, but no merges occur (tiles in columns are non-adjacent or of different values). The board becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 4|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 2|4|2|0  \n     ```  \n   - No immediate score gain, and tiles are scattered with no clear corner for large values.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving LEFT merges the 4s in row 0 for an immediate score of 8, positions the 8 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and aligns 2s vertically in column 0 for potential future merges. This is the best option.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|4  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 2|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left but no merges occur (all non-zero tiles are unique or separated by zeros).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     Row 0: 8|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 2|4|0|0  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 2|0|0|0  \n   - No score gain.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right but no merges occur (non-zero tiles are unique or separated by zeros).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     Row 0: 0|0|0|8  \n     Row 1: 0|0|2|4  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|2  \n   - No score gain.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed upward. Key changes:  \n     - **Column 0**: Tiles [8, 2, 0, 2] shift up to [8, 2, 2, 0]. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in [8, 4, 0, 0].  \n     - **Column 3**: Tiles [0, 4, 0, 0] shift up to [4, 0, 0, 0].  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     Row 0: 8|0|0|4  \n     Row 1: 4|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   - Score gain: 4.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed downward. Key changes:  \n     - **Column 0**: Tiles [8, 2, 0, 2] shift down to [0, 2, 2, 8]. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in [0, 0, 4, 8].  \n     - **Column 3**: Tiles [0, 4, 0, 0] shift down to [0, 0, 0, 4].  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 4|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 8|0|0|4  \n   - Score gain: 4.  \n\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nThe goal is to keep larger tiles in a corner for strategic merging. The largest tile (8) remains in the top-left corner (row 0, column 0) after an UP move, which is ideal for future merges. In contrast, a DOWN move shifts the 8 to the bottom-left corner (row 3, column 0), which is less optimal for building upward. UP also consolidates smaller tiles (4) in the same column as the 8, creating opportunities for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|0|0|4  \nRow 1: 4|0|0|4  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left → [8, 4, 0, 0] (no merge, as 8 and 4 are different).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left → [4, 4, 0, 0] → merge into 8 → [8, 0, 0, 0] (score +8).  \n- Rows 2 and 3 remain unchanged (all zeros).  \n- Resulting board after LEFT:  \n  8|4|0|0  \n  8|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n- Strategic advantage: Two 8s stack vertically in column 0 (row 0 and row 1). This sets up a potential merge into 16 with a subsequent UP swipe, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (left column).  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right → [0, 0, 8, 4] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right → [0, 0, 4, 4] → merge into 8 → [0, 0, 0, 8] (score +8).  \n- Resulting board after RIGHT:  \n  0|0|8|4  \n  0|0|0|8  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n- Strategic disadvantage: 8s are spread across the right edge (row 0, column 2 and row 1, column 3), making future merges less likely.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift up → [8, 4, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles shift up → [4, 4, 0, 0] → merge into 8 → [8, 0, 0, 0] (score +8).  \n- Resulting board after UP:  \n  8|0|0|8  \n  4|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n- Strategic disadvantage: 8s are in the top row (column 0 and column 3), not consolidated in a single corner, reducing opportunities for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift down → [0, 0, 4, 8] (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles shift down → [0, 0, 0, 8] (merge of 4s into 8, score +8).  \n- Resulting board after DOWN:  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  4|0|0|0  \n  8|0|0|8  \n- Strategic disadvantage: 8s are in the bottom row (column 0 and column 3), not consolidated, limiting future merge potential.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe consolidates two 8s vertically in the left column, creating a strategic opportunity to merge them into 16 with a subsequent UP swipe. This aligns with the goal of keeping larger tiles in a corner and maximizing future merge potential.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 4 | 0 | 4  \nRow 1: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: Tiles shift left.

The key difference lies in positioning larger tiles for future moves. Swiping UP places the merged 16 in the top-left corner, a strategic corner for building a sequence of higher tiles. This aligns with the goal of keeping large tiles in corners to facilitate future merges. Swiping DOWN places the 16 in the bottom-left corner, but the top-left corner is more advantageous for maintaining a consistent growth pattern.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the current game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16 | 4 | 0 | 4  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### 1. LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [16, 4, 0, 4] → Tiles shift left, merging adjacent 4s into 8. New row: [16, 8, 0, 0]. Score increases by 8 (from merging 4s).  \n- **Row 1-2**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 3**: [4, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts left to [4, 0, 0, 0]. No merges.  \n- Result: 16 (top-left corner) remains, with 8 adjacent to it, maintaining a corner-focused structure.  \n\n\n#### 2. RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [16, 4, 0, 4] → Tiles shift right, merging the two 4s (now at positions 2 and 3) into 8. New row: [16, 0, 0, 8]. Score increases by 8.  \n- **Row 1-2**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 3**: [4, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 0, 4]. No merges.  \n- Result: 16 (top-left) and 8 (top-right) are spread apart, which is less strategic for future merges.  \n\n\n#### 3. UP Swipe:\n- **Columns**: Tiles shift upward, but no adjacent equal numbers merge.  \n  - Column 0: [16, 0, 0, 4] → [16, 4, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n  - Column 1: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n  - Columns 2-3: All zeros, no change.  \n- Result: No merges, no score gain.  \n\n\n#### 4. DOWN Swipe:\n- **Columns**: Tiles shift downward, but no adjacent equal numbers merge.  \n  - Column 0: [16, 0, 0, 4] → [0, 0, 16, 4] (no merge).  \n  - Column 1: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merge).  \n  - Columns 2-3: All zeros, no change.  \n- Result: No merges, no score gain.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge 4s into 8 (score +8), but LEFT keeps the largest tile (16) in the top-left corner and positions the merged 8 adjacent to it, which is more strategic for future merges. UP and DOWN do not merge any tiles and are suboptimal.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile placement.\n\n### LEFT\n- **Row 0**: `16|8|0|0` → Tiles shift left, no merging (16 and 8 are distinct).

Result: `16|4|0|0` (column).\n- **Column 1**: `8, 0, 0, 4` → Tiles shift up, no merging (8 and 4 are distinct). Result: `8|4|0|0` (column).\n- **Columns 2-3**: All zeros, no change.\n- **Outcome**: No merges occur; 4s from Row 3 move to Row 1 but do not merge immediately. No score gain.\n\n### DOWN\n- **Column 0**: `16, 0, 0, 4` → Tiles shift down, no merging (16 and 4 are distinct). Result: `0|0|16|4` (column).\n- **Column 1**: `8, 0, 0, 4` → Tiles shift down, no merging (8 and 4 are distinct). Result: `0|0|8|4` (column).\n- **Columns 2-3**: All zeros, no change.\n- **Outcome**: No merges occur; 16 and 8 move down to Row 2, which is less strategic than keeping them in the top-left.\n\n### Conclusion\nLEFT is the best move. It merges the 4s in Row 3 for an 8-point gain, retains the larger tiles (16 and 8) in the top-left corner (a strategic position), and maximizes immediate score and future merging potential.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes, focusing on merging tiles for higher scores and strategic placement of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 8 | 0 | 0\nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 0 | 8 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- Tiles shift left in each row. No merges occur because no adjacent equal tiles exist after shifting. The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- Tiles shift right in each row. No merges occur because no adjacent equal tiles exist after shifting. The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.\n\n### UP Move:\n- Tiles shift upward in each column. Key observation: In **Column 1** (values: 8 (Row 0), 0 (Row 1), 8 (Row 2), 0 (Row 3)), the two 8s are vertically adjacent after shifting. These merge into a 16, yielding a score of 16.  \n  Post-UP board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 16 | 16 | 0 | 0  (Column 0: 16 and 8 shift up, no merge; Column 1: 8s merge into 16)\n  Row 1: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0    (Remaining 8 from Column 0 shifts up)\n  Rows 2-3: All zeros\n  ```\n  This positions two 16s in Row 0, which can merge into 32 with a subsequent LEFT move, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- Tiles shift downward in each column. Key observation: In **Column 1** (values: 8 (Row 0), 0 (Row 1), 8 (Row 2), 0 (Row 3)), the two 8s are vertically adjacent after shifting. These merge into a 16, yielding a score of 16.  \n  Post-DOWN board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n  Row 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n  Row 2: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0  (16 from Column 0 shifts down)\n  Row 3: 8 | 16 | 0 | 0  (8 from Column 0 and merged 16 from Column 1)\n  ```\n  While this also merges 8s, the resulting 16s are scattered, making future merges less strategic compared to UP.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is superior because it merges 8s into 16, positions two 16s in Row 0 (facilitating future merges into 32 in the top-left corner), and aligns with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16|16|0|0  \nRow 1: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|8|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: The two adjacent 16s merge into 32 (score +32). The row becomes 32|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 1**: The 8 shifts left to the first position (no merge). The row remains 8|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 3**: The 8 in column 1 shifts left to column 0. The row becomes 8|0|0|0.  \n- **Result**: After merging, the board has 32 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for larger tiles), with 8s in row 1 and row 3, column 0. This positions the 8s to potentially merge vertically in future moves (e.g., a subsequent UP swipe).  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32) and shift right. The row becomes 0|0|0|32.  \n- **Row 1**: The 8 shifts right to the last position. The row becomes 0|0|0|8.  \n- **Row 3**: The 8 shifts right to the last position. The row becomes 0|0|0|8.  \n- **Result**: The 32 is in the top-right corner, with 8s in row 1 and row 3, column 3. While this is a corner, the 8s are less likely to merge strategically compared to the LEFT move.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: 16 (row 0) and 8 (row 1) shift up (no merge). Column 0 becomes 16|8|0|0.  \n- **Column 1**: 16 (row 0) and 8 (row 3) shift up (no merge). Column 1 becomes 16|8|0|0.  \n- **Result**: Rows 0 and 1 become [16|16|0|0] and [8|8|0|0], respectively. No merges occur in this move, and the board lacks immediate strategic positioning for large tiles.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: 16 (row 0) and 8 (row 1) shift down (no merge). Column 0 becomes 0|0|8|16.  \n- **Column 1**: 16 (row 0) and 8 (row 3) shift down (no merge). Column 1 becomes 0|0|8|16.  \n- **Result**: Rows 2 and 3 become [8|8|0|0] and [16|16|0|0], respectively. No merges occur in this move, and the board lacks immediate strategic positioning for large tiles.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe LEFT move immediately merges the 16s into a 32 (score +32) and positions the 32 in the top-left corner, a strategic corner for future merges. The 8s in row 1 and row 3, column 0, are also positioned to merge vertically in subsequent moves. This makes LEFT the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes on the given game board:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\n32|16|0|0\n8|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n8|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles). The board remains mostly unchanged, with empty spaces filled by a new tile (2\/4). No score gain.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles). The board becomes:  \n     `0|0|32|16`  \n     `0|0|0|8`  \n     `0|0|0|0`  \n     `0|0|0|8`  \n   No score gain.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift upward. For column 1 (top to bottom: 32, 8, 0, 8):  \n     - Tiles stack as 32, 8, 8, 0 (after shifting up).  \n     - The two 8s in positions 2 and 3 merge into 16 (score +16).  \n   - Column 2 (16, 0, 0, 0) remains 16 in row 1.  \n   - Resulting board after merge:  \n     `32|16|0|0`  \n     `16|0|0|0`  \n     `0|0|0|0`  \n     `0|0|0|0`  \n   - Larger tiles (32, 16) are kept in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift downward. For column 1 (32, 8, 0, 8):  \n     - Tiles stack as 0, 32, 8, 8 (after shifting down).  \n     - The two 8s in positions 3 and 4 merge into 16 (score +16).  \n   - Column 2 (16, 0, 0, 0) shifts to row 4 (16 in row 4).  \n   - Resulting board after merge:  \n     `0|0|0|0`  \n     `32|0|0|0`  \n     `0|0|0|0`  \n     `16|16|0|0`  \n   - Larger tiles (32, 16) are scattered, reducing strategic cornering potential.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP is the best move. It merges two 8s into 16 (scoring 16), keeps the largest tile (32) in the top-left corner, and positions smaller tiles (16) nearby for future merges. \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|16|0|0\nRow 1: 16|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|8|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (32 and 16 in Row 0 are distinct; 16 in Row 1 and 8 in Row 3 have no adjacent duplicates).  \n   - Result: Tiles cluster left, but no score gain.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (32 and 16 in Row 0 remain distinct; 16 in Row 1 and 8 in Row 3 have no adjacent duplicates).  \n   - Result: Tiles cluster right, but no score gain.  \n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   - Tiles shift up, but no merges occur (32 and 16 in Column 0 are distinct; 16 and 8 in Column 1 are distinct).  \n   - Result: Tiles cluster top, but no score gain.  \n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   - Tiles shift down. Columns are processed from bottom to top:  \n     - Column 0: 32 (Row 0) and 16 (Row 1) shift down to Row 3 and Row 2, respectively → Column 0 becomes `0|0|16|32`.  \n     - Column 1: 16 (Row 0) and 8 (Row 3) shift down to Row 2 and Row 3, respectively → Column 1 becomes `0|0|16|8`.  \n   - After shifting, Row 2 becomes `16|16|0|0` (two adjacent 16s in Columns 0 and 1).  \n   - While no merges occur during the DOWN move, this positions two 16s adjacently in Row 2, creating a future merge opportunity (e.g., a subsequent LEFT move would merge these 16s into 32, yielding a score of 32).  \n\n### Strategic Choice:\nThe DOWN move strategically positions two 16s in the same row (Row 2), setting up for a potential merge in the next move. This aligns with the goal of consolidating tiles to create higher-value merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 64|0|0|32  \nRow 1: 32|8|0|0  \nRow 2: 16|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   Tiles shift left in each row.  \n   - Row 0: `64|0|0|32` → `64|32|0|0` (no merge, as 64 ≠ 32).  \n   - Row 1: `32|8|0|0` → `32|8|0|0` (no merge, as 32 ≠ 8).  \n   - Row 2: `16|0|0|0` → `16|0|0|0` (no change).  \n   - Row 3: All zeros (no change).  \n\n   Resulting board after LEFT:  \n   ```\n   64|32|0|0  \n   32|8|0|0  \n   16|0|0|0  \n   0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   Non-zero tiles cluster on the left, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (top-left here). This grouping increases the potential for future merges (e.g., if a new 32 appears in row 0, column 2, a subsequent LEFT move could merge the two 32s in row 0).\n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   Tiles shift right in each row.  \n   - Row 0: `64|0|0|32` → `0|0|64|32` (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: `32|8|0|0` → `0|32|8|0` (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: `16|0|0|0` → `0|0|0|16` (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: All zeros (no change).  \n\n   Resulting board scatters tiles toward the right, with 64 in row 0, column 2—less strategic for corner-based merging.\n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   Tiles shift up in each column.  \n   - Column 0: `64|32|16|0` → `64|32|16|0` (no merge).  \n   - Column 1: `0|8|0|0` → `8|0|0|0` (8 moves to row 0, column 1).  \n   - Column 3: `32|0|0|0` → `32|0|0|0` (no change).  \n\n   Resulting board:  \n   ```\n   64|8|0|32  \n   32|0|0|0  \n   16|0|0|0  \n   0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   The 32 in row 0, column 3 is isolated, reducing future merge potential compared to LEFT.\n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   Tiles shift down in each column.  \n   - Column 0: `64|32|16|0` → `0|64|32|16` (no merge).  \n   - Column 1: `0|8|0|0` → `0|0|0|8` (8 moves to row 3, column 1).  \n   - Column 3: `32|0|0|0` → `0|0|0|32` (32 moves to row 3, column 3).  \n\n   Resulting board scatters tiles downward, with 64 in row 1, column 0—less optimal for corner-based strategy.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT move clusters non-zero tiles on the left, keeping the largest tile (64) in the top-left corner and grouping smaller tiles nearby. This alignment maximizes future merge potential and follows the strategic goal of concentrating tiles in a corner.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile positioning. The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities while keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 32 | 0 | 0\nRow 1: 32 | 8 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\nKey observations:\n- All tiles are in the leftmost two columns of the first three rows.\n- No adjacent tiles of the same value exist (no immediate merges possible in any direction).\n- The largest tile (64) is in the top-left corner (row 0, column 0), a strategic corner for stability.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Swiping left shifts all tiles to the left edge. Since tiles are already as far left as possible, no merges occur. However, this preserves the top-left corner (where the 64 is) and keeps smaller tiles aligned to the left, maintaining a compact structure for future merges (e.g., potential 32 merges if new tiles spawn appropriately).\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Swiping right shifts tiles to the right edge. This scatters the tiles (e.g., 64 moves to row 0, column 2), moving the largest tile away from the corner. This reduces strategic positioning for future merges.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Swiping up shifts tiles upward. The tiles are already as high as possible (no empty spaces above them), so the board remains unchanged. No merges occur, and the structure is preserved but not optimized.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Swiping down shifts tiles downward. This moves the largest tile (64) from row 0, column 0 to row 1, column 0, disrupting the corner position. Smaller tiles are scattered lower, reducing compactness and future merging potential.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT preserves the largest tile (64) in the top-left corner, keeps smaller tiles compactly aligned to the left, and maintains a structure conducive to future merges. This aligns with the strategic goal of keeping large tiles in corners and organizing smaller tiles for merging.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and board positioning for future moves.\n\n### LEFT\n- **Row 1**: 64|32|0|0 → 64|32|0|0 (no merges, tiles shift left).  \n- **Row 2**: 32|8|0|0 → 32|8|0|0 (no merges, tiles shift left).  \n- **Row 3**: 16|4|8|0 → 16|4|8|0 (no merges, tiles shift left).  \n- **Row 4**: 0|0|0|0 → 0|0|0|0 (no change).  \nNo immediate merges, but the largest tile (64) remains in the top-left corner, and smaller tiles (32, 16) align along the left edge, creating a strategic corner cluster for future merges.\n\n### RIGHT\n- **Row 1**: 64|32|0|0 → 0|0|64|32 (no merges, tiles shift right).  \n- **Row 2**: 32|8|0|0 → 0|0|32|8 (no merges, tiles shift right).  \n- **Row 3**: 16|4|8|0 → 0|16|4|8 (no merges, tiles shift right).  \n- **Row 4**: 0|0|0|0 → 0|0|0|0 (no change).  \nNo merges, and larger tiles (64, 32) are spread to the right, reducing corner clustering.\n\n### UP\n- **Column 1**: 64, 32, 16, 0 → 64, 32, 16, 0 (no merges, tiles shift up).  \n- **Column 2**: 32, 8, 4, 0 → 32, 8, 4, 0 (no merges, tiles shift up).  \n- **Column 3**: 0, 0, 8, 0 → 8, 0, 0, 0 (8 shifts up to row 1).  \n- **Column 4**: 0, 0, 0, 0 → 0, 0, 0, 0 (no change).  \nNo merges, and the 8 in row 1, column 3 disrupts the top-left cluster, making future merges less efficient.\n\n### DOWN\n- **Column 1**: 64, 32, 16, 0 → 0, 64, 32, 16 (tiles shift down).  \n- **Column 2**: 32, 8, 4, 0 → 0, 32, 8, 4 (tiles shift down).  \n- **Column 3**: 0, 0, 8, 0 → 0, 0, 0, 8 (8 shifts down to row 4).  \n- **Column 4**: 0, 0, 0, 0 → 0, 0, 0, 0 (no change).  \nNo merges, and larger tiles (64, 32, 16) are spread vertically, reducing corner concentration.\n\n### Conclusion\nNone of the moves result in immediate merges, but **LEFT** keeps the largest tile (64) in the top-left corner and aligns smaller tiles (32, 16) along the left edge, optimizing the board for future strategic merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\n64|32|0|0\n32|8|0|0\n16|4|8|8\n0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 1**: `64|32|0|0` (no merging, tiles already left-aligned).\n- **Row 2**: `32|8|0|0` (no merging, tiles already left-aligned).\n- **Row 3**: `16|4|8|8` → Tiles shift left, and the two `8`s merge into `16` (score +16). Result: `16|4|16|0`.\n- **Row 4**: `0|0|0|0` (no change).\n\nAfter LEFT swipe, the board becomes:\n```\n64|32|0|0\n32|8|0|0\n16|4|16|0\n0|0|0|0\n```\nLarger tiles (64, 32, 32, 16, 16) remain left-aligned, maintaining a compact structure in the top-left corner, which is strategically favorable.\n\n### RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 1**: `0|0|64|32` (no merging, tiles shift right).\n- **Row 2**: `0|0|32|8` (no merging, tiles shift right).\n- **Row 3**: `0|16|4|16` (two `8`s merge into `16`, score +16).\n- **Row 4**: `0|0|0|0` (no change).\n\nAfter RIGHT swipe, the board becomes:\n```\n0|0|64|32\n0|0|32|8\n0|16|4|16\n0|0|0|0\n```\nLarger tiles shift to the right, but the structure is less compact compared to LEFT, with gaps in the left columns.\n\n### UP Swipe:\n- Columns shift up, but no merges occur (all tiles in columns are distinct or separated by zeros).

However, LEFT maintains larger tiles (64, 32, 32, 16) in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future merges. RIGHT shifts tiles to the right, creating a less compact structure. Thus, LEFT is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merging potential and maintain larger tiles in a corner for strategic advantage.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 32 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 32 | 8 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 16 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 32  \n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift left in each row.  \n   - Row 0: [64, 32, 0, 0] (no merges, 64 and 32 stay leftmost).  \n   - Row 1: [32, 8, 0, 0] (no merges, 32 and 8 stay leftmost).  \n   - Row 2: [16, 4, 16, 0] (no merges, 16, 4, 16 shift left).  \n   - Row 3: [32, 0, 0, 0] (32 shifts left to column 0).  \n   This move keeps larger tiles (64, 32, 16) aligned to the left, maintaining a corner-focused strategy. Empty spaces remain on the right, allowing future tiles to spawn in non-critical areas.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right in each row.  \n   - Row 0: [0, 0, 64, 32] (no merges, 64 and 32 shift right).  \n   - Row 1: [0, 0, 32, 8] (no merges, 32 and 8 shift right).  \n   - Row 2: [0, 16, 4, 16] (no merges, 16, 4, 16 shift right).  \n   - Row 3: [0, 0, 0, 32] (32 stays rightmost).  \n   This scatters larger tiles to the right, reducing strategic alignment with a corner.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift up in each column.  \n   - Column 0: [64, 32, 16, 0] (no merges, tiles shift up).  \n   - Column 1: [32, 8, 4, 0] (no merges, tiles shift up).  \n   - Column 2: [16, 0, 0, 0] (16 shifts up to row 0).  \n   - Column 3: [32, 0, 0, 0] (32 shifts up to row 0).  \n   This moves smaller tiles (16, 32) to the top row, disrupting the corner focus of the largest tile (64).\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift down in each column.  \n   - Column 0: [0, 64, 32, 16] (tiles shift down).  \n   - Column 1: [0, 32, 8, 4] (tiles shift down).  \n   - Column 2: [0, 0, 0, 16] (16 shifts down to row 3).  \n   - Column 3: [0, 0, 0, 32] (32 stays bottom-right).  \n   This moves the largest tile (64) from row 0 to row 1, weakening the corner strategy.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nThe LEFT swipe maintains the largest tile (64) in the top-left corner, aligns other large tiles (32, 16) to the left, and keeps empty spaces on the right for future tile spawns. This aligns with the strategic goal of concentrating larger tiles in a corner for easier merging.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and check for valid merges and strategic positioning of tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 32 | 0 | 0\nRow 1: 32 | 8 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 16 | 0\nRow 3: 32 | 0 | 4 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [64, 32, 0, 0] → Shifts left to [64, 32, 0, 0] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [32, 8, 0, 0] → Shifts left to [32, 8, 0, 0] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [16, 4, 16, 0] → Shifts left to [16, 4, 16, 0] (no merges, as 16s are separated by 4).\n- **Row 3**: [32, 0, 4, 0] → Shifts left to [32, 4, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [64, 32, 0, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 64, 32] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [32, 8, 0, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 32, 8] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [16, 4, 16, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 4, 16, 16] (two 16s merge into 32).  \n  Merged row becomes [0, 4, 0, 32], adding 32 to the score.\n- **Row 3**: [32, 0, 4, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 32, 4] (no merges).  \n**Result**: Merges 16s in Row 2 into 32 (score +32).\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [64, 32, 16, 32] → Tiles stack upward (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [32, 8, 4, 0] → Tiles stack upward (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: [0, 0, 16, 4] → Tiles stack upward to [16, 4, 0, 0] (no merges).\n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 0, 0] → No change.  \n**Result**: No merges.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [64, 32, 16, 32] → Tiles stack downward (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [32, 8, 4, 0] → Tiles stack downward to [0, 32, 8, 4] (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: [0, 0, 16, 4] → Tiles stack downward (no merges).\n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 0, 0] → No change.  \n**Result**: No merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only valid merge occurs with a **RIGHT Swipe**, where two 16s in Row 2 merge into a 32, increasing the score.

No merges occur, and the board remains nearly unchanged. Not useful.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles exist to merge. Rows 1–3 shift right but remain unmerged. No score gain. Not useful.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 1** (values: 32, 8, 8, 0) is critical. When moving up, the two 8s in rows 1 and 2 merge into 16 (score +16). Other columns (0, 2, 3) have no merges but shift upward. The resulting board (before new tile) is:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 128|32|16|4\n  Row 1: 16|16|0|8  (merged 16s in row 1, column 1)\n  Row 2: 32|0|0|0\n  Row 3: 16|0|0|0\n  ```\n  This creates adjacent 16s in row 1 (columns 0 and 1), which can be merged in a subsequent LEFT swipe for a 32 (score +32). This is strategically valuable.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 1** (values: 32, 8, 8, 0) merges the two 8s in rows 2 and 3 into 16 (score +16). **Column 2** (value: 16) shifts to row 3. The resulting board (before new tile) is:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 128|0|0|0\n  Row 1: 16|32|0|0\n  Row 2: 32|0|0|4\n  Row 3: 16|16|16|8  (three 16s in row 3)\n  ```\n  While row 3 has three 16s, merging them requires a LEFT swipe, but the adjacent 16s in row 1 (from UP swipe) offer a more immediate and impactful merge (16+16=32) in the next move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe merges 8s into 16 (score +16) and creates adjacent 16s in row 1, enabling a high-value merge (16+16=32) in the next move.

Tiles move to lower positions but do not merge. While valid (tiles shift), it does not create strategic opportunities for future merges.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe largest tile (128) is in the top-left corner. To maintain this corner and build toward higher merges, LEFT is optimal:\n- Merges 16+16 in Row 1 into 32 (score +32).\n- Positions 32s in Column 0 (Row 1 and Row 2), creating a future merge opportunity (swiping UP next could merge these 32s into 64).\n- Keeps larger tiles (128, 32) aligned left, supporting the corner strategy.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize score and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 4  \nRow 1: 32 | 8 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **Swipe LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   - **Left**: All tiles in each row are already shifted leftmost, with no adjacent equal tiles to merge. No score is gained.  \n   - **Right**: Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles merge. No score is gained.  \n\n2. **Swipe DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0 (vertical) has `[128, 32, 32, 16]`. When moving down, the two `32`s merge into `64` (score +64). The merged column becomes `[0, 128, 64, 16]`.  \n   - Other columns (1, 2, 3) have no merges. The resulting board spreads larger tiles (128, 64, 16) across lower rows, with less consolidation in a corner.  \n\n3. **Swipe UP**:  \n   - Column 0 has `[128, 32, 32, 16]`. When moving up, the two `32`s merge into `64` (score +64). The merged column becomes `[128, 64, 16, 0]`.  \n   - Other columns (1, 2, 3) have no merges. The resulting board consolidates larger tiles (128, 64, 16) in the top-left corner, leaving empty spaces in lower rows for future flexibility.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSwipping **UP** merges two `32`s into `64` (gaining 64 points) and positions larger tiles in the top-left corner, a strategic corner for future merges. This is better than other directions, which either yield no score or suboptimal tile placement.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules and strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and facilitating future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128|32|16|4  \nRow 1: 64|8|0|0  \nRow 2: 16|2|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|4|0|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles in each row shift left to fill empty spaces.  \n   - Row 0: [128, 32, 16, 4] (no empty spaces, no change).  \n   - Row 1: [64, 8, 0, 0] → [64, 8, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [16, 2, 0, 0] → [16, 2, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [0, 4, 0, 0] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (4 shifts left).  \n   - **Result**: Larger tiles (128, 64, 32, 16) remain in the top-left corner, maintaining a strategic corner concentration. Empty spaces are preserved for future tile spawns, and the row order (128, 32, 16, 4) is descending, which is ideal for potential merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles in each row shift right to fill empty spaces.  \n   - Row 0: [128, 32, 16, 4] (no empty spaces, no change).  \n   - Row 1: [64, 8, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 64, 8] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [16, 2, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 16, 2] (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [0, 4, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (4 shifts right).  \n   - **Result**: Larger tiles are spread out, breaking the corner concentration. This is less strategic for future merges.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles in each column shift up to fill empty spaces.  \n   - Column 0: [128, 64, 16, 0] → [128, 64, 16, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: [32, 8, 2, 4] → [32, 8, 2, 4] (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [16, 0, 0, 0] → [16, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - **Result**: No merges occur, and larger tiles remain in the top rows but do not consolidate into a corner.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles in each column shift down to fill empty spaces.  \n   - Column 0: [128, 64, 16, 0] → [0, 128, 64, 16] (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: [32, 8, 2, 4] → [32, 8, 2, 4] (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [16, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 16] (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merges).  \n   - **Result**: Larger tiles (128, 64, 16) are pushed downward, spreading them out and reducing corner concentration.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT move preserves the strategic corner concentration of larger tiles (128, 64, 32, 16) in the top-left, maintains a descending order in Row 0, and keeps empty spaces available for future tile spawns. This aligns with the strategy of consolidating larger tiles in a corner to facilitate future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to merge tiles strategically, prioritize consolidating larger tiles in a corner, and set up future merging opportunities.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 4  \nRow 1: 64 | 8 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 16 | 2 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 4 | 0 | 0 | 4  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles (128, 32, 16, 4) are already left-aligned with no gaps; no merging.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (64, 8, 0, 0) shift left to (64, 8, 0, 0); no merging.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (16, 2, 0, 0) shift left to (16, 2, 0, 0); no merging.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles (4, 0, 0, 4) shift left, merging the two 4s into 8. Result: (8, 0, 0, 0). Score: 8.  \n\nAfter a LEFT swipe, the merged 8 is placed in row 3, column 0 (leftmost column). This aligns with the existing large tiles (128, 64, 16) in column 0, creating a vertical sequence (128, 64, 16, 8) that can facilitate future merges if additional matching tiles appear.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles (128, 32, 16, 4) are already right-aligned with no gaps; no merging.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (64, 8, 0, 0) shift right to (0, 0, 64, 8); no merging.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (16, 2, 0, 0) shift right to (0, 0, 16, 2); no merging.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles (4, 0, 0, 4) shift right, merging the two 4s into 8. Result: (0, 0, 0, 8). Score: 8.  \n\nThe merged 8 is placed in row 3, column 3 (rightmost corner), which is distant from the largest tile (128 in the top-left corner). This spreads out large tiles, making future merges harder.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles (128, 64, 16, 4) are already top-aligned; no merging.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (32, 8, 2, 0) shift up to (32, 8, 2, 0); no merging.  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles (16, 0, 0, 0) shift up to (16, 0, 0, 0); no merging.  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles (4, 0, 0, 4) shift up, merging the two 4s into 8. Result: (8, 0, 0, 0). Score: 8.  \n\nThe merged 8 is placed in row 0, column 3 (top-right corner), which is distant from the largest tile (128 in the top-left corner). This also spreads out large tiles.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles (128, 64, 16, 4) shift down to (4, 16, 64, 128); no merging.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (32, 8, 2, 0) shift down to (0, 32, 8, 2); no merging.  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles (16, 0, 0, 0) shift down to (0, 0, 0, 16); no merging.  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles (4, 0, 0, 4) shift down, merging the two 4s into 8. Result: (0, 0, 0, 8). Score: 8.  \n\nThe merged 8 is placed in row 3, column 3 (bottom-right corner), which is distant from the largest tile (128 in the top-left corner). This spreads out large tiles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe consolidates the merged 8 into the leftmost column, aligning with the existing large tiles (128, 64, 16) in column 0. This builds a vertical sequence that supports future merging opportunities, keeping large tiles in the top-left corner—a strategic position. Other directions spread out large tiles, reducing future merging potential.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in [16, 0, 0, 0].  \n\n**Result**: Row 3 becomes [16, 0, 0, 0]. The left column (column 0) now has 128 (row 0), 64 (row 1), 16 (row 2), and 16 (row 3), creating a potential future merge (e.g., swiping UP next could merge the two 16s in column 0).\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles (128, 32, 16, 4) are distinct and non-zero; no merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (64, 8) shift right, resulting in [0, 0, 64, 8]; no merges.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (16, 2) shift right, resulting in [0, 0, 16, 2]; no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles (8, 0, 0, 8) shift right. The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in [0, 0, 0, 16].  \n\n**Result**: Row 3 becomes [0, 0, 0, 16]. The right column (column 3) has 4 (row 0), 8 (row 1), 2 (row 2), and 16 (row 3), with no immediate merge potential.\n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed top-to-bottom. All columns (128, 64, 16, 8; 32, 8, 2, 0; 16, 0, 0, 0; 4, 0, 0, 8) have distinct or non-adjacent tiles.

No merges occur. **Score: 0**.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 16 points, but LEFT is better for future merges. After a LEFT swipe, the left column (column 0) has two 16s (row 2 and row 3), which can merge with a subsequent UP swipe. This strategic setup aligns with keeping larger tiles in a corner and maximizing future opportunities.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given game board.

DOWN moves the 128 to row 1, which is less optimal. Thus, UP is the better choice.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile alignment, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 4\nRow 1: 64 | 8 | 64 | 0\nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles `128, 32, 16, 4` are distinct and left-aligned; no movement or merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `64, 8, 64, 0` shift left (no zeros between non-zero tiles), resulting in `64, 8, 64, 0` (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `32, 2, 0, 0` shift left, resulting in `32, 2, 0, 0` (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tile `4` shifts left, resulting in `4, 0, 0, 0` (no merges).  \n- **Outcome**: No merges, but tiles remain left-aligned, maintaining a structured layout with larger tiles (128, 64, 32) in the left columns.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles `128, 32, 16, 4` are distinct and right-aligned; no movement or merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `64, 8, 64, 0` shift right, resulting in `0, 64, 8, 64` (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `32, 2, 0, 0` shift right, resulting in `0, 0, 32, 2` (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tile `4` shifts right, resulting in `0, 0, 0, 4` (no merges).  \n- **Outcome**: No merges, but tiles shift right, potentially scattering larger tiles away from the left corner.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles `128, 64, 32, 4` are distinct and top-aligned; no movement or merges.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles `32, 8, 2, 0` shift up, resulting in `32, 8, 2, 0` (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles `16, 64, 0, 0` shift up, resulting in `16, 64, 0, 0` (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tile `4` shifts up, resulting in `4, 0, 0, 0` (no merges).  \n- **Outcome**: No merges, but tiles remain top-aligned. However, this does not strengthen the corner (128 is already top-left).\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles `128, 64, 32, 4` are distinct and bottom-aligned; no movement or merges.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles `32, 8, 2, 0` shift down, resulting in `0, 2, 8, 32` (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles `16, 64, 0, 0` shift down, resulting in `0, 0, 16, 64` (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tile `4` shifts down, resulting in `0, 0, 0, 4` (no merges).  \n- **Outcome**: No merges, but tiles shift down, potentially spreading larger tiles and weakening the top-left corner.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe largest tile (128) is already in the top-left corner, a strong position. Swiping LEFT maintains the left-aligned structure of the board, keeping larger tiles (128, 64, 32) in the left columns. This alignment facilitates future merges (e.g., if a new 32 or 16 appears adjacent to existing tiles in row 0 or row 1). Other directions (RIGHT, UP, DOWN) either scatter tiles or fail to strengthen the corner.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential, tile positioning, and strategic goals (e.g., keeping large tiles in a corner).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128|32|16|4\nRow 1: 64|8|64|0\nRow 2: 32|2|0|0\nRow 3: 4|32|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - No tiles merge (all tiles in rows are distinct or already left-aligned).  \n   - No tiles shift into empty spaces (rows are already left-aligned).  \n   - **Invalid** (no valid moves or shifts).  \n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - No tiles merge (columns have distinct values or are already top-aligned).  \n   - No tiles shift into empty spaces (columns are already top-aligned).  \n   - **Invalid** (no valid moves or shifts).  \n\n3. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right in rows 1, 2, and 3 (empty spaces on the right allow movement).  \n   - Row 1 becomes `0|64|8|64`, row 2 becomes `0|0|32|2`, row 3 becomes `0|0|4|32`.  \n   - No merges occur, but it is a valid move (tiles shift into empty spaces).  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down in columns 2 and 3 (empty spaces at the bottom allow movement).  \n   - Column 2 becomes `0|0|16|64` (16 and 64 shift down), column 3 becomes `0|0|0|4` (4 shifts down).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 128|32|0|0  \n     Row 1: 64|8|0|0  \n     Row 2: 32|2|16|0  \n     Row 3: 4|32|64|4  \n     ```  \n   - No merges occur, but it is a valid move (tiles shift into empty spaces).  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe goal is to keep large tiles (e.g., 128) in a corner and minimize clutter near them. After a move, a new tile (2 or 4) is added to an empty space.  \n\n- **RIGHT** adds new tiles to the left side (rows 1, 2, 3, columns 0-1), which is near the 128 in row 0, column 0. This risks blocking the corner.  \n- **DOWN** adds new tiles to the right side (rows 0-2, columns 2-3), which is away from the 128. This keeps the left corner free and reduces clutter around large tiles.  \n\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current game board is:\n```\n128|32|0|0\n64|8|64|0\n32|2|16|0\n4|32|64|4\n```\nKey observations:\n- No immediate merges are possible in any direction (no adjacent tiles of the same value in the direction of movement).\n- The largest tile (128) is in the top-left corner, a strategic position to prioritize.\n- Empty spaces (zeros) are spread across the grid, with 4 total zeros.\n\n\n### Direction Evaluation:\n#### LEFT:\n- **Row 1**: `128|32|0|0` (no change, tiles left-aligned).\n- **Row 2**: `64|8|64|0` (no change, tiles left-aligned; 64s remain separated by 8).\n- **Row 3**: `32|2|16|0` (no change, tiles left-aligned).\n- **Row 4**: `4|32|64|4` (no change, tiles left-aligned).\n- **Result**: No merges.

After shifting, 64 (Row 2, Column 2) and 64 (Row 3, Column 2) become adjacent and merge into 128, adding 128 to the score.  \n- Other columns: No merges, but tiles shift down to fill empty spaces, maintaining the 128 (largest tile) in the top-left corner.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe DOWN swipe enables a critical merge of two 64 tiles in Column 2, resulting in a 128 tile and increasing the score. This move also keeps the largest tile (128) in the corner, supporting long-term strategic play.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score through merges while strategically positioning larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 2 | 0\nRow 1: 64 | 8 | 64 | 0\nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 16 | 16\nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: `[128, 32, 2, 0]` → Tiles shift left (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: `[64, 8, 64, 0]` → Tiles shift left (no merges, 64s are not adjacent).  \n- **Row 2**: `[32, 2, 16, 16]` → The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). Row becomes `[32, 2, 32, 0]`.  \n- **Row 3**: `[4, 32, 64, 4]` → Tiles shift left (no merges).  \n\n**Result**: Merges 16s in Row 2 for 32 points. Larger tiles (128, 64, 32, 4) remain in the left column (corner), supporting a strategic corner stack.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: `[128, 32, 2, 0]` → Tiles shift right (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: `[64, 8, 64, 0]` → Tiles shift right (no merges, 64s are not adjacent).  \n- **Row 2**: `[32, 2, 16, 16]` → The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). Row becomes `[0, 32, 2, 32]`.  \n- **Row 3**: `[4, 32, 64, 4]` → Tiles shift right (no merges).  \n\n**Result**: Merges 16s in Row 2 for 32 points, but larger tiles (e.g., 128) move away from the corner, weakening the corner stack.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- Columns are processed top to bottom. No adjacent tiles merge (all columns have distinct values or non-adjacent duplicates). No score gained.  \n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- Columns are processed bottom to top. No adjacent tiles merge (all columns have distinct values or non-adjacent duplicates). No score gained.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nLEFT and RIGHT both merge 16s for 32 points, but LEFT preserves the corner stack of larger tiles (128, 64, 32, 4), which is strategically better for future merges. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score through merging tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 2 | 0\nRow 1: 64 | 8 | 64 | 0\nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 64\nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [128, 32, 2, 0] → Shifts to [128, 32, 2, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [64, 8, 64, 0] → Shifts to [64, 8, 64, 0] (no merges, 64s are separated by 8).  \n   - Row 2: [32, 2, 32, 64] → Shifts to [32, 2, 32, 64] (no merges, 32s are separated by 2).  \n   - Row 3: [4, 32, 64, 4] → Shifts to [4, 32, 64, 4] (no merges, 4s are separated by 32 and 64).  \n   **Result**: No merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [128, 32, 2, 0] → Shifts to [0, 128, 32, 2] (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [64, 8, 64, 0] → Shifts to [0, 8, 64, 64] (64s merge into 128, score +128).  \n   - Row 2: [32, 2, 32, 64] → Shifts to [32, 2, 32, 64] (no merges, 32s are separated by 2).  \n   - Row 3: [4, 32, 64, 4] → Shifts to [4, 32, 64, 4] (no merges, 4s are separated by 32 and 64).  \n   **Result**: One merge (Row 1: 64 + 64 = 128, score +128).  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed, but all columns have non-zero tiles with no adjacent equal values.  \n   **Result**: No merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed, but all columns have non-zero tiles with no adjacent equal values.  \n   **Result**: No merges.  \n\n\nThe only valid merge occurs with a RIGHT swipe, merging two 64s in Row 1 into 128. This move maximizes the score.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement. The goal is to maximize score and position larger tiles advantageously.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 32 | 2\nRow 1: 0 | 64 | 8 | 64\nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 64\nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The only potential merge is in **Column 3** (rows 1 and 2), where two `64` tiles are adjacent. Merging these would create a `128` tile, adding 128 to the score.\n- Other tiles are either non-adjacent or of different values, so no other merges are possible in LEFT, RIGHT, or other directions.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**: No merges occur. Tiles shift but do not combine, resulting in no score gain. These moves are suboptimal.\n   \n2. **UP**: \n   - Column 3 (rows 1 and 2) has two `64` tiles. Swiping UP causes these `64` tiles to merge into a `128` in row 1, column 3. The merged tile is placed higher (row 1), leaving empty spaces in row 3.\n\n3. **DOWN**: \n   - Column 3 (rows 1 and 2) has two `64` tiles. Swiping DOWN causes these `64` tiles to merge into a `128` in row 2, column 3. The merged tile is placed lower (row 2), closer to the bottom-right corner, which is a strategic position for larger tiles.\n\n### Strategic Preference:\nMerging the `64` tiles in Column 3 via **DOWN** places the new `128` tile in row 2, column 3. This position aligns with the common strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners (bottom-right corner in this case), facilitating future merges and reducing the risk of blocking larger tiles.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities and position larger tiles in corners, as per strategic guidelines.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 128 | 32 | 16\nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2\nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128\nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles shift left, filling the empty space (0) in column 0. Result: `[128, 32, 16, 0]`. The 128 moves to the top-left corner (desirable for corner consolidation).  \n   - **Row 1**: No empty spaces, so tiles remain: `[8, 64, 8, 2]`.  \n   - **Row 2**: No empty spaces, so tiles remain: `[32, 2, 32, 128]`.  \n   - **Row 3**: No empty spaces, so tiles remain: `[4, 32, 64, 4]`.  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges occur, but the 128 in row 0 moves to the top-left corner, a strategic position for future merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles are already right-aligned (no empty spaces to the right of non-zero tiles). Result: `[0, 128, 32, 16]`.  \n   - **Row 1**: No empty spaces, so tiles remain: `[8, 64, 8, 2]`.  \n   - **Row 2**: No empty spaces, so tiles remain: `[32, 2, 32, 128]`.  \n   - **Row 3**: No empty spaces, so tiles remain: `[4, 32, 64, 4]`.  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges or strategic positioning of large tiles.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles shift up, filling the empty space (0) in row 0. Result: `[8, 32, 4, 0]`.  \n   - **Column 1**: No empty spaces, so tiles remain: `[128, 64, 2, 32]`.  \n   - **Column 2**: No empty spaces, so tiles remain: `[32, 8, 32, 64]`.  \n   - **Column 3**: No empty spaces, so tiles remain: `[16, 2, 128, 4]`.  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges, and large tiles (e.g., 128) are not positioned in corners.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles shift down, filling the empty space (0) in row 3. Result: `[0, 8, 32, 4]`.  \n   - **Column 1**: No empty spaces, so tiles remain: `[128, 64, 2, 32]`.  \n   - **Column 2**: No empty spaces, so tiles remain: `[32, 8, 32, 64]`.  \n   - **Column 3**: No empty spaces, so tiles remain: `[16, 2, 128, 4]`.  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges, and large tiles (e.g., 128) are not positioned in corners.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe is the best move. It shifts the 128 in row 0 to the top-left corner (a strategic corner for consolidating large tiles) without blocking future merging opportunities. Other moves fail to position large tiles advantageously.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile consolidation, and strategic placement of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 8  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128  \nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4  \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No Empty Tiles**: The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same value.  \n- **No Immediate Merges**: All rows and columns have no adjacent tiles with the same value. For example:  \n  - Row 0: 128, 32, 16, 8 (all distinct).  \n  - Row 1: 8, 64, 8, 2 (8s are separated by 64).  \n  - Row 2: 32, 2, 32, 128 (32s are separated by 2).  \n  - Row 3: 4, 32, 64, 4 (4s are separated by 32 and 64).  \n  - Columns similarly have no adjacent duplicates.  \n\n### Strategic Considerations:\nSince no merges are possible, the goal shifts to positioning tiles to enable future merges. The largest tiles (128s) are at (0,0) (top-left) and (2,3) (bottom-right). To consolidate larger tiles in corners (a common 2048 strategy), moving LEFT keeps the 128 in the top-left corner stable, while other tiles in the row remain aligned. This maintains a potential future merge path for smaller tiles (e.g., 32s, 8s) that could shift left over time.\n\n### Evaluation of Directions:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: None result in immediate merges, but LEFT is chosen to keep the top-left corner (128) stable and align smaller tiles for future shifts.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and valid moves. The grid is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 8  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128  \nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid is Full**: All 16 tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces, i.e., no `0`).  \n2. **Valid Moves Requirement**: A valid move requires either adjacent tiles of the same number or empty spaces to shift tiles. Since the grid is full, valid moves depend on adjacent same-numbered tiles.  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT Swipe**: For each row, tiles shift left. No adjacent same-numbered tiles exist in any row (e.g., Row 2: `32, 2, 32, 128` has non-adjacent 32s, separated by 2). No merges occur.  \n- **RIGHT Swipe**: Tiles shift right. Similarly, no adjacent same-numbered tiles exist in any row (e.g., Row 3: `4, 32, 64, 4` has non-adjacent 4s, separated by 32 and 64). No merges occur.  \n- **UP Swipe**: Tiles shift up. Columns are checked for adjacent same-numbered tiles (e.g., Column 1: `32, 64, 2, 32` has non-adjacent 32s, separated by 64 and 2). No merges occur.  \n- **DOWN Swipe**: Tiles shift down. Columns are checked for adjacent same-numbered tiles (e.g., Column 3: `8, 2, 128, 4` has no adjacent matches). No merges occur.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and there are no adjacent same-numbered tiles. Thus, no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, a default choice is made.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic goals (e.g., consolidating large tiles).

Thus, no direction will result in tile movement or merging.\n\n### Evaluation of Directions:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Shifting tiles left or right does not change the board, as all tiles are already compacted with no empty spaces, and no adjacent tiles to merge.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Shifting tiles up or down also leaves the board unchanged, as vertical adjacency checks show no merges, and all tiles are already positioned with no empty spaces to shift into.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions fail to produce movement or merges. However, per the problem constraints, a direction must be chosen.

Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are equal, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.  \n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: All directions fail to produce merges or shift tiles (grid is full with no empty spaces). Despite this, a direction must be chosen. Given the lack of valid moves, the choice is arbitrary, but strategic conventions (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners) are considered. The 128s are already in corners (row 0, column 0; row 2, column 3), so no further optimization is possible.  \n\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning.

Tiles shift but remain in their relative positions (no merges).\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Similarly, no adjacent duplicates in columns mean no merges.

However, since the problem requires selecting one of the directions, the answer is arbitrary. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) by evaluating tile merges and valid moves according to the game rules. The game board is full (no empty tiles), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number. \n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current 4x4 grid has no empty tiles (all 16 positions are occupied). We check for adjacent tiles (horizontally and vertically) with the same number, as these are the only valid moves when the grid is full.\n\n#### Horizontal Adjacents (Same Row, Adjacent Columns):\n- **Row 1**: 128-32-16-8 (all distinct).\n- **Row 2**: 8-64-8-2 (all distinct).\n- **Row 3**: 32-2-32-128 (all distinct).\n- **Row 4**: 4-32-64-4 (all distinct).\n\n#### Vertical Adjacents (Same Column, Adjacent Rows):\n- **Column 1**: 128-8-32-4 (all distinct).\n- **Column 2**: 32-64-2-32 (all distinct).\n- **Column 3**: 16-8-32-64 (all distinct).\n- **Column 4**: 8-2-128-4 (all distinct).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\nSince there are no adjacent tiles with the same number and the grid is full, **no valid merges are possible in any direction**.

All distinct; no merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles are [8, 64, 8, 2]. 8s are separated by 64; no merges.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles are [32, 2, 32, 128]. 32s are separated by 2; no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles are [4, 32, 64, 4]. 4s are separated by 32 and 64; no merges.  \n\nNo merges occur, but since the grid is full, LEFT is invalid unless adjacent merges exist (they do not).\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are [128, 32, 16, 8]. All distinct; no merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles are [8, 64, 8, 2]. 8s are separated by 64; no merges.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles are [32, 2, 32, 128]. 32s are separated by 2; no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles are [4, 32, 64, 4]. 4s are separated by 32 and 64; no merges.  \n\nNo merges occur; RIGHT is invalid.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [128, 8, 32, 4]. All distinct; no merges.  \n- **Column 1**: [32, 64, 2, 32]. 32s are separated by 64 and 2; no merges.  \n- **Column 2**: [16, 8, 32, 64]. All distinct; no merges.  \n- **Column 3**: [8, 2, 128, 4]. All distinct; no merges.  \n\nNo merges occur; UP is invalid.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [128, 8, 32, 4]. All distinct; no merges.  \n- **Column 1**: [32, 64, 2, 32]. 32s are separated by 64 and 2; no merges.  \n- **Column 2**: [16, 8, 32, 64]. All distinct; no merges.  \n- **Column 3**: [8, 2, 128, 4]. All distinct; no merges.  \n\nNo merges occur; DOWN is invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent tiles of the same value, meaning no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the most strategic choice (by convention) is **LEFT**, as it aligns with typical 2048 strategies of consolidating tiles toward a corner.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and valid movement. The grid is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 128|32|16|8  \nRow 1: 8|64|8|2  \nRow 2: 32|2|32|128  \nRow 3: 4|32|64|4  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles**: All 16 tiles are non-zero (no 0s), so movement requires merging adjacent equal tiles to create space.\n- **No adjacent equal tiles**: Checking horizontal and vertical adjacents, there are no pairs of equal tiles that can merge in any direction. For example:\n  - Row 1 has 8s separated by 64 (non-adjacent).\n  - Row 2 has 32s separated by 2 (non-adjacent).\n  - Row 3 has 4s separated by 32 and 64 (non-adjacent).\n  - No vertical pairs of equal tiles exist either.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Tiles cannot shift left\/right because there are no empty spaces, and no adjacent equal tiles to merge. Rows remain unchanged.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Tiles cannot shift up\/down because columns are full, and no adjacent equal tiles to merge. Columns remain unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves are invalid (no merges or shifts possible) since the grid is full with no adjacent equal tiles. However, per the problem constraints, an answer must be selected from the four options.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and tile movement. The game board is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number to merge.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\n128|32|16|8\n8|64|8|2\n32|2|32|128\n4|32|64|4\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Directions:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 1: [128, 32, 16, 8] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [8, 64, 8, 2] (8s are separated by 64, no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [32, 2, 32, 128] (32s are separated by 2, no merges).  \n   - Row 4: [4, 32, 64, 4] (4s are separated by 32 and 64, no merges).  \n   **No merges possible.**\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 1: [128, 32, 16, 8] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [8, 64, 8, 2] (8s are separated by 64, no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [32, 2, 32, 128] (32s are separated by 2, no merges).  \n   - Row 4: [4, 32, 64, 4] (4s are separated by 32 and 64, no merges).  \n   **No merges possible.**\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 1: [128, 8, 32, 4] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [32, 64, 2, 32] (32s are separated by 64 and 2, no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [16, 8, 32, 64] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 4: [8, 2, 128, 4] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   **No merges possible.**\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 1: [128, 8, 32, 4] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [32, 64, 2, 32] (32s are separated by 64 and 2, no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [16, 8, 32, 64] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 4: [8, 2, 128, 4] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   **No merges possible.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied, and no adjacent tiles have the same value. By the rules, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the directions, a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify merges, maximize score, and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 8  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128  \nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles are already left-aligned with no duplicates (128, 32, 16, 8). No merges.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles (8, 64, 8, 2) are left-aligned; no adjacent duplicates. No merges.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles (32, 2, 32, 128) have 32s separated by a 2. No merges.  \n   - Row 3: Tiles (4, 32, 64, 4) are left-aligned; no adjacent duplicates. No merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges or movement.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles are right-aligned (128, 32, 16, 8).

For example:  \n     - Column 0: 128, 8, 32, 4 (all distinct).  \n     - Column 1: 32, 64, 2, 32 (32s separated by two tiles).  \n   **Result**: No merges or movement.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are already stacked downward with no adjacent duplicates. For example:  \n     - Column 0: 128, 8, 32, 4 (all distinct).  \n     - Column 3: 8, 2, 128, 4 (all distinct).  \n   **Result**: No merges or movement.  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\nThe grid is fully occupied (no zeros), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number. Thus, no valid merges are possible in any direction. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners (e.g., 128 in (0,0) and (2,3)), a left swipe maintains the left-aligned structure, which is a common strategy to keep larger tiles in the top-left corner for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. The key is to check for valid moves, which require either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or moving tiles into empty spaces. The current grid has no empty tiles (all cells are filled with non-zero values), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same number.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 8  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128  \nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [128, 32, 16, 8] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [8, 64, 8, 2] (8s are not adjacent, no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [32, 2, 32, 128] (32s are separated by 2, no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [4, 32, 64, 4] (4s are not adjacent, no merges).  \n   - **Result**: No merges or movement.

Invalid.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom. All columns (e.g., [128, 8, 32, 4], [32, 64, 2, 32], etc.) have distinct values with no adjacent matches.  \n   - **Result**: No merges or movement. Invalid.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom to top. All columns (e.g., [128, 8, 32, 4], [32, 64, 2, 32], etc.) have distinct values with no adjacent matches.  \n   - **Result**: No merges or movement. Invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied with no adjacent tiles of the same number, meaning no valid moves exist. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Since all directions are invalid, but the task demands a choice, the answer defaults to one of the options.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to check for potential tile merges and valid shifts. The game board is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require either adjacent tiles to merge or tiles to shift into new positions. Here's the analysis:\n\n### LEFT Swipe\n- **Row 0**: [128, 32, 16, 8] – All tiles are distinct and left-aligned. No merges or shifts.\n- **Row 1**: [8, 64, 8, 2] – Tiles are left-aligned, and the 8s are not adjacent.

For example, Row 0 (128, 32, 16, 8) has no duplicates. Row 1 (8, 64, 8, 2) has 8s separated by 64. Row 2 (32, 2, 32, 128) has 32s separated by 2. Row 3 (4, 32, 64, 4) has 4s separated by 32 and 64. No merges occur.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Similar to LEFT, all rows have no adjacent duplicates when shifted right. For example, Row 1 (8, 64, 8, 2) has 8s not adjacent after shifting right. No merges occur.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - All columns have distinct adjacent tiles. Column 0 (128, 8, 32, 4), Column 1 (32, 64, 2, 32), Column 2 (16, 8, 32, 64), and Column 3 (8, 2, 128, 4) have no adjacent duplicates. No merges occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - All columns also have no adjacent duplicates when shifted down. For example, Column 1 (32, 64, 2, 32) has 32s separated by 64 and 2. No merges occur.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full (no empty tiles), and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) are the same. Thus, no valid merges are possible for any direction. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four moves, the choice defaults to a direction that minimally disrupts tile alignment.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify merges that increase the score and align with strategic placement of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current grid has no empty tiles (0s), meaning all tiles are occupied. A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same value or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n\n### Evaluation of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [128, 32, 16, 8] – All distinct, no merges.  \n   - Row 1: [8, 64, 8, 2] – 8s are separated by 64, no merge.  \n   - Row 2: [32, 2, 32, 128] – 32s are separated by 2, no merge.  \n   - Row 3: [4, 32, 64, 4] – 4s are separated by 32 and 64, no merge.  \n   **Result**: No merges or tile shifts.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [128, 32, 16, 8] – All distinct, no merges.  \n   - Row 1: [8, 64, 8, 2] – 8s are separated by 64, no merge.  \n   - Row 2: [32, 2, 32, 128] – 32s are separated by 2, no merge.  \n   - Row 3: [4, 32, 64, 4] – 4s are separated by 32 and 64, no merge.  \n   **Result**: No merges or tile shifts.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: [128, 8, 32, 4] – All distinct, no merges.  \n   - Column 1: [32, 64, 2, 32] – 32s are separated by 64 and 2, no merge.  \n   - Column 2: [16, 8, 32, 64] – All distinct, no merges.  \n   - Column 3: [8, 2, 128, 4] – All distinct, no merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges or tile shifts.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: [128, 8, 32, 4] – All distinct, no merges.  \n   - Column 1: [32, 64, 2, 32] – 32s are separated by 64 and 2, no merge.  \n   - Column 2: [16, 8, 32, 64] – All distinct, no merges.  \n   - Column 3: [8, 2, 128, 4] – All distinct, no merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges or tile shifts.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions result in no merges or tile shifts because the grid is full with no adjacent tiles of the same value. However, based on strategic guidance to keep larger tiles in corners, a left swipe maintains the 128 in the top-left corner, which is a stable position. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to identify which direction allows for tile merging, as merging increases the score and maintains valid moves.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 8  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128  \nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles `128, 32, 16, 8` are all unique and left-aligned. No merges.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles `8, 64, 8, 2` are all unique and left-aligned. No merges.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles `32, 2, 32, 128` are left-aligned, but `32` (column 0) and `32` (column 2) are separated by `2`. No merges.  \n   - Row 3: Tiles `4, 32, 64, 4` are all unique and left-aligned. No merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles `128, 32, 16, 8` are right-aligned. No merges.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles `8, 64, 8, 2` are right-aligned. No merges.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles `32, 2, 32, 128` shift right. The `32` (column 0) moves to column 1, and `2` (column 1) shifts to column 0. This aligns `32` (column 1) and `32` (column 2) adjacently. They merge into `64`, creating an empty space (0) in column 1.  \n   - Row 3: Tiles `4, 32, 64, 4` are right-aligned. No merges.  \n   **Result**: Merges `32` and `32` in Row 2 into `64`, yielding 64 points.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are top-aligned, with no adjacent duplicates. No merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are bottom-aligned, with no adjacent duplicates. No merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only valid merge occurs with a **RIGHT swipe** in Row 2, where two `32` tiles merge into `64`. This move maximizes the score and maintains future opportunities for merging.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 8  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128  \nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Grid Status**: All tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces), so the grid is full.  \n- **Adjacent Tiles**: No horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles have the same value. For example:  \n  - Row 0: 128, 32, 16, 8 (all distinct).  \n  - Row 1: 8, 64, 8, 2 (8s are separated by 64, not adjacent).  \n  - Row 2: 32, 2, 32, 128 (32s are separated by 2, not adjacent).  \n  - Row 3: 4, 32, 64, 4 (4s are separated by 32 and 64, not adjacent).  \n  - Columns similarly have no adjacent duplicates.  \n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are the same, no merges are possible in any direction. Tiles cannot shift into empty spaces (as there are none), and no adjacent pairs can merge.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nEven though no immediate merges are possible, the goal is to choose a direction that might set up future merges. Given the grid is full, any move would not change tile positions but would theoretically trigger the game to end (since no valid moves remain). However, per the problem constraints, a direction must be selected.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and tile movement. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 8  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128  \nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid Status**: All 16 tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces), so the grid is full. For a move to be valid, there must be adjacent equal tiles in the direction of the swipe (since no empty spaces exist to shift tiles into).\n2. **Horizontal Adjacency**: No row contains adjacent equal tiles. For example:\n   - Row 0: 128, 32, 16, 8 (all distinct).  \n   - Row 1: 8, 64, 8, 2 (8s are separated by 64, not adjacent).  \n   - Row 2: 32, 2, 32, 128 (32s are separated by 2, not adjacent).  \n   - Row 3: 4, 32, 64, 4 (4s are separated by 32 and 64, not adjacent).  \n3. **Vertical Adjacency**: No column contains adjacent equal tiles. For example:\n   - Column 0: 128, 8, 32, 4 (all distinct).  \n   - Column 1: 32, 64, 2, 32 (32s are separated by 64 and 2, not adjacent).  \n   - Column 2: 16, 8, 32, 64 (all distinct).  \n   - Column 3: 8, 2, 128, 4 (all distinct).  \n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipes**: Since no horizontal adjacent equal tiles exist, these swipes will not trigger merges. Tiles cannot shift (grid is full), so no movement occurs.  \n- **UP\/DOWN Swipes**: Since no vertical adjacent equal tiles exist, these swipes will also not trigger merges. Tiles cannot shift (grid is full), so no movement occurs.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent equal tiles exist in any direction. By the rules, no valid moves remain. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we assume the intended answer is based on strategic positioning (e.g., aligning tiles for future merges). Among the options, **LEFT** is chosen as a default direction.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on whether tiles can merge or shift into empty spaces (valid moves). A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or shifting tiles into empty spaces. The current board has no empty tiles (all 16 tiles are filled), so valid moves depend solely on the ability to merge adjacent tiles in the direction of the swipe.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 8\nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2\nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128\nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [128, 32, 16, 8] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [8, 64, 8, 2] (8s are not adjacent after shifting, no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [32, 2, 32, 128] (32s are separated by 2, no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [4, 32, 64, 4] (4s are not adjacent after shifting, no merges).  \n   - **No merges or shifts possible. Invalid move.**\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [128, 32, 16, 8] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [8, 64, 8, 2] (8s are not adjacent after shifting, no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [32, 2, 32, 128] (32s are separated by 2, no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [4, 32, 64, 4] (4s are not adjacent after shifting, no merges).  \n   - **No merges or shifts possible. Invalid move.**\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: [128, 8, 32, 4] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 1: [32, 64, 2, 32] (32s are separated by 64 and 2, no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [16, 8, 32, 64] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [8, 2, 128, 4] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - **No merges or shifts possible. Invalid move.**\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: [128, 8, 32, 4] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 1: [32, 64, 2, 32] (32s are separated by 64 and 2, no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [16, 8, 32, 64] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [8, 2, 128, 4] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - **No merges or shifts possible. Invalid move.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll four directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are invalid because there are no adjacent tiles to merge, and the grid is full (no empty spaces to shift into). However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four options, and no direction is strictly better than others in this scenario, a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid, which has no empty tiles (0s) and requires merging adjacent tiles of the same value to score. A valid move either merges tiles or shifts tiles into empty spaces. Since all tiles are filled (no 0s), a valid move must involve merging adjacent same-value tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 8  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128  \nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: All tiles (128, 32, 16, 8) are distinct and already left-aligned.

No merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges or shifts.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid has no empty tiles, and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. Thus, **no valid moves** exist to merge or shift tiles. However, per the problem constraints, the answer must be one of the four directions. Given no meaningful distinction between moves, any direction is technically invalid, but the problem requires a choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize score through tile merges while strategically positioning larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 8\nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2\nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128\nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `128, 32, 16, 8` are all distinct; no merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `8, 64, 8, 2` are all distinct; no merges.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `32, 2, 32, 128` have two `32`s. When shifted left, the `32` at position 2 moves to position 1 (adjacent to the `32` at position 0), merging into `64`. Score: `64`.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `4, 32, 64, 4` have two `4`s. When shifted left, the `4` at position 3 moves to position 1 (adjacent to the `4` at position 0), merging into `8`.

However, the RIGHT swipe positions the `128` tile in row 2, column 3 (a corner), which aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners for future merges. This is more favorable than the LEFT swipe, which leaves the `128` tile in a non-corner position.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merges and valid moves.

Additionally, with no empty spaces, tiles cannot shift, so the board remains unchanged.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves are invalid (no merges or shifts possible), but the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid merges, any direction is functionally equivalent, but we choose **LEFT** as a default.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of merging tiles and shifting.

The key is to check for valid moves, which require either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or moving tiles into empty spaces. The current grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 8  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128  \nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles are already left-aligned with no adjacent duplicates.

Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, **no direction will result in a merge or tile movement**. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nIn such a scenario, the choice is arbitrary, but strategically, keeping larger tiles in corners is preferred. The largest tile (128) is in the top-left corner (Row 0, Column 0). Swiping left preserves this corner position, aligning with the strategy of consolidating large tiles.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges and valid moves in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number to merge.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 8  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128  \nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles (128, 32, 16, 8) are all distinct; no merges.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles (8, 64, 8, 2) have 8s separated by 64; no merges.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles (32, 2, 32, 128) have 32s separated by 2; no merges.  \n   - Row 3: Tiles (4, 32, 64, 4) have 4s separated by 32 and 64; no merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles (128, 32, 16, 8) are all distinct; no merges.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles (8, 64, 8, 2) have 8s separated by 64; no merges.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles (32, 2, 32, 128) have 32s separated by 2; no merges.  \n   - Row 3: Tiles (4, 32, 64, 4) have 4s separated by 32 and 64; no merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: Tiles (128, 8, 32, 4) are all distinct; no merges.  \n   - Column 1: Tiles (32, 64, 2, 32) have 32s separated by 64 and 2; no merges.  \n   - Column 2: Tiles (16, 8, 32, 64) are all distinct; no merges.  \n   - Column 3: Tiles (8, 2, 128, 4) are all distinct; no merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: Tiles (128, 8, 32, 4) are all distinct; no merges.  \n   - Column 1: Tiles (32, 64, 2, 32) have 32s separated by 64 and 2; no merges.  \n   - Column 2: Tiles (16, 8, 32, 64) are all distinct; no merges.  \n   - Column 3: Tiles (8, 2, 128, 4) are all distinct; no merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full (no empty tiles), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number to merge. According to the rules, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the directions, a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic tile arrangement. The current game board is:\n\n```\n128|32|16|8\n8|64|8|2\n32|2|32|128\n4|32|64|4\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Grid is Full**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no zeros), so no empty spaces exist to shift tiles into.\n- **No Adjacent Merges**: Checking all rows and columns, there are no adjacent tiles with the same number. For example:\n  - Rows: 128, 32, 16, 8 (row 0); 8, 64, 8, 2 (row 1); 32, 2, 32, 128 (row 2); 4, 32, 64, 4 (row 3) — all have distinct adjacent values.\n  - Columns: 128, 8, 32, 4 (column 0); 32, 64, 2, 32 (column 1); 16, 8, 32, 64 (column 2); 8, 2, 128, 4 (column 3) — all have distinct adjacent values.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, none of these directions will result in tile movement or merges. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.\n\nGiven the lack of valid merges or empty spaces, any direction is technically invalid, but the task mandates choosing a direction. A common strategy in such scenarios (even with no immediate merges) is to prioritize keeping larger tiles in a corner for future potential. Here, the largest tiles (128s) are already in corners (top-left and bottom-right), so maintaining their positions is neutral. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) for potential merges or strategic positioning.

All moves are invalid under the rules (no merges or empty spaces to shift into).\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nDespite no immediate merges, the game requires selecting a direction. A common strategy is to keep larger tiles in a corner. The largest tiles (128s) are at (0,0) and (2,3). Swiping LEFT preserves the 128 at (0,0) in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile arrangement.

This means no immediate merges are possible without first shifting tiles.\n2. **Valid Moves**: A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since the grid is full, valid moves depend on whether tiles can shift to create merges or prepare for future merges.\n\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n#### LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: `128|32|16|8`—All distinct, no merges.\n- **Row 1**: `8|64|8|2`—All distinct, no merges.\n- **Row 2**: `32|2|32|128`—The two `32`s are separated by `2`. Shifting left could align them if the `2` moves right, but no empty spaces prevent this. No merges.\n- **Row 3**: `4|32|64|4`—All distinct, no merges.\n\n#### RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: `128|32|16|8`—All distinct, no merges.\n- **Row 1**: `8|64|8|2`—All distinct, no merges.\n- **Row 2**: `32|2|32|128`—All distinct, no merges.\n- **Row 3**: `4|32|64|4`—All distinct, no merges.\n\n#### UP:\n- **Column 0**: `128|8|32|4`—All distinct, no merges.\n- **Column 1**: `32|64|2|32`—All distinct, no merges.\n- **Column 2**: `16|8|32|64`—All distinct, no merges.\n- **Column 3**: `8|2|128|4`—All distinct, no merges.\n\n#### DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: `128|8|32|4`—All distinct, no merges.\n- **Column 1**: `32|64|2|32`—All distinct, no merges.\n- **Column 2**: `16|8|32|64`—All distinct, no merges.\n- **Column 3**: `8|2|128|4`—All distinct, no merges.\n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nSince no immediate merges are possible, the focus shifts to preparing for future merges by aligning larger tiles in corners. The largest tiles (128s) are in the top-left (row 0, col 0) and bottom-right (row 2, col 3) corners. Moving LEFT keeps the top-left 128 in place, maintaining a corner anchor for future merges.\n\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of tile merging and movement. The key is to identify if any direction allows tiles to merge or shift into empty spaces (valid moves).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 8  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128  \nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Each row is processed left-to-right. No adjacent tiles in any row are equal (e.g., Row 0: 128, 32, 16, 8; Row 1: 8, 64, 8, 2 has non-adjacent 8s; Row 2: 32, 2, 32, 128 has non-adjacent 32s; Row 3: 4, 32, 64, 4 has non-adjacent 4s). No merges occur, and no empty spaces exist to shift tiles into. Thus, LEFT is not a valid move.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Each row is processed right-to-left. Similar to LEFT, no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. Tiles cannot merge, and no empty spaces exist to shift into. RIGHT is not a valid move.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Each column is processed top-to-bottom. Columns have no adjacent equal tiles (e.g., Column 0: 128, 8, 32, 4; Column 1: 32, 64, 2, 32 has non-adjacent 32s; Column 2: 16, 8, 32, 64; Column 3: 8, 2, 128, 4). No merges occur, and no empty spaces exist to shift tiles into. UP is not a valid move.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Each column is processed bottom-to-top. Columns have no adjacent equal tiles (e.g., Column 0: 128, 8, 32, 4; Column 1: 32, 64, 2, 32 has non-adjacent 32s; Column 2: 16, 8, 32, 64; Column 3: 8, 2, 128, 4).

DOWN is not a valid move.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles), and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) are equal. By the rules, a valid move requires either adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to shift into. Since neither condition is met, there are no valid moves.

Since no immediate merges are possible, the focus shifts to strategic positioning of larger tiles (e.g., keeping them in corners).\n\n### Evaluation of Directions:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Shifting left or right would not merge any tiles, as all rows are full and tiles are distinct. However, shifting left aligns with the common strategy of consolidating smaller tiles toward one edge (left), which can facilitate future merges.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Similarly, shifting up or down would not merge tiles, as columns are full and tiles are distinct. Vertical shifts are less likely to consolidate smaller tiles effectively compared to horizontal shifts.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nGiven the lack of immediate merges, the best strategy is to align tiles in a way that sets up future merges. Shifting **LEFT** keeps larger tiles (e.g., 128 in Row 0, Column 0) in a corner and consolidates smaller tiles toward the left edge, which is a common and effective strategy in 2048.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile movement. The current board has no empty tiles (all cells are non-zero), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value to merge. \n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe game board is:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 8  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128  \nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4  \n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles are [128, 32, 16, 8] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Row 1: Tiles are [8, 64, 8, 2] (8s are not adjacent, no merges).  \n   - Row 2: Tiles are [32, 2, 32, 128] (32s are separated by 2, no merges).  \n   - Row 3: Tiles are [4, 32, 64, 4] (4s are separated by 32 and 64, no merges).  \n   **Result**: No merges or movement.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles are [128, 32, 16, 8] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Row 1: Tiles are [8, 64, 8, 2] (8s are not adjacent, no merges).  \n   - Row 2: Tiles are [32, 2, 32, 128] (32s are separated by 2, no merges).  \n   - Row 3: Tiles are [4, 32, 64, 4] (4s are separated by 32 and 64, no merges).  \n   **Result**: No merges or movement.  \n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   - Column 0: [128, 8, 32, 4] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 1: [32, 64, 2, 32] (32s are separated by 64 and 2, no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [16, 8, 32, 64] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [8, 2, 128, 4] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   **Result**: No merges or movement.  \n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   - Column 0: [128, 8, 32, 4] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 1: [32, 64, 2, 32] (32s are separated by 64 and 2, no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [16, 8, 32, 64] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [8, 2, 128, 4] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   **Result**: No merges or movement.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full (no empty tiles), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same value to merge.

Thus, **no valid moves** exist. However, per the problem constraints, the answer must be one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid moves, the choice is arbitrary, but no direction provides a valid outcome.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning. The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 128|32|16|8  \nRow 1: 8|64|8|2  \nRow 2: 32|2|32|128  \nRow 3: 4|32|64|4  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid Status**: All 16 tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces), so the grid is full.  \n2. **Merging Requirements**: A valid move requires either adjacent tiles of the same value (to merge) or empty spaces (to shift tiles). Since the grid is full, valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles.  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**:  \n  Each row is processed leftward. No adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., Row 0: 128,32,16,8; Row 1: 8,64,8,2; Row 2: 32,2,32,128; Row 3: 4,32,64,4). No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift (grid is full).  \n\n- **RIGHT**:  \n  Each row is processed rightward. Similar to LEFT, no adjacent tiles in any row are the same. Tiles remain in place, and no merges occur.  \n\n- **UP**:  \n  Each column is processed upward. Columns have no adjacent same tiles (e.g., Column 0: 128,8,32,4; Column 1: 32,64,2,32; Column 2: 16,8,32,64; Column 3: 8,2,128,4). No merges or shifts occur.  \n\n- **DOWN**:  \n  Each column is processed downward. Like UP, columns have no adjacent same tiles. Tiles remain fixed, and no merges occur.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions fail to trigger merges or shifts (grid is full with no adjacent same tiles). However, the game requires selecting a direction. Strategically, keeping larger tiles (e.g., 128) in corners is preferred. Swiping **LEFT** keeps the 128 in Row 0, Column 0 (top-left corner), a stable position for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement.

For example:  \n  - Row 1 has two 8s, but they are separated by 64 (non-adjacent).  \n  - Row 2 has two 32s, but they are separated by 2 (non-adjacent).  \n  - Row 3 has two 4s, but they are separated by 32 and 64 (non-adjacent).  \n  - Columns similarly have no adjacent duplicates.  \n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Shifting tiles left or right in any row will not merge any tiles, as no adjacent duplicates exist, and the grid is full (no empty spaces to shift into).  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: Shifting tiles up or down in any column will also not merge any tiles, as no adjacent duplicates exist, and the grid is full (no empty spaces to shift into).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can be merged, there are no valid moves.

Row 0, column 1 becomes empty (0).  \n\nThis merge in column 1 during a DOWN move is the only valid merge across all directions, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges and valid moves. The current game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 8  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 8 | 2  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 32 | 128  \nRow 3: 4 | 32 | 64 | 4  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **No Empty Tiles**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n2. **Horizontal Adjacents**: In each row, no two adjacent tiles have the same value. For example:\n   - Row 0: 128, 32, 16, 8 (all distinct).\n   - Row 1: 8, 64, 8, 2 (8s are separated by 64, not adjacent).\n   - Row 2: 32, 2, 32, 128 (32s are separated by 2, not adjacent).\n   - Row 3: 4, 32, 64, 4 (4s are separated by 32 and 64, not adjacent).\n3. **Vertical Adjacents**: In each column, no two adjacent tiles have the same value. For example:\n   - Column 0: 128, 8, 32, 4 (all distinct).\n   - Column 1: 32, 64, 2, 32 (32s are separated by 64 and 2, not adjacent).\n   - Column 2: 16, 8, 32, 64 (all distinct).\n   - Column 3: 8, 2, 128, 4 (all distinct).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: None of these directions result in merging tiles because there are no adjacent tiles of the same value. Additionally, since the grid is full (no empty spaces), no tiles can shift into empty spaces. Thus, no valid moves exist under the rules.\n\nDespite the grid being full with no valid moves, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, any direction is technically invalid, but the answer must be chosen from the options provided.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile alignment.

Tiles remain bottom-aligned; no valid move.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) fail to create merges, and the grid is full with no empty spaces. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the only possible choice (despite no valid merges) is **DOWN**.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to identify merges and score gains.

When shifting right, the leftmost 32 (position 0) moves right past 2 (position 1) and merges with the 32 at position 2, forming 64. This gives a score of 64. The row becomes 0|2|64|128.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles (4, 32, 64, 4). When shifting right, the leftmost 4 (position 0) moves right past 32 and 64, merging with the 4 at position 3, forming 8.

Tiles shift up but do not merge.  \n**Result**: No merges or score gain.  \n\n\n### DOWN Swipe  \n- **Columns 0-3**: All columns contain distinct tiles. Tiles shift down but do not merge.  \n**Result**: No merges or score gain.  \n\n\nThe RIGHT swipe results in the highest score gain (72 points) due to merges in Row 2 and Row 3.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges and strategic positioning.

This direction is more strategic for long-term progression.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and the game rules.

Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n128|32|16|8\n8|64|8|2\n32|2|32|128\n4|32|64|4\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

This makes future merges less straightforward, as adjacent tiles in the same row or column are not aligned.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 1 (0, 0, 2, 0) shifts down to 0|0|0|2 (row 3, column 1).  \n   - Column 3 (0, 2, 0, 0) shifts down to 0|0|0|2 (row 3, column 3).  \n   - Resulting board (before new tile):  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 0|2|0|2  \n     ```  \n   - No merges occur, and tiles are spread across row 3 (columns 1 and 3). This makes future merges less straightforward compared to RIGHT or LEFT.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nThe goal is to position tiles for future merges and keep larger tiles in corners. Moving RIGHT aligns the two 2s in column 3 (rightmost column), setting up a potential merge with a subsequent DOWN move into the bottom-right corner (a strategic corner). This is more favorable than other directions, as it leverages corner positioning for larger tiles.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of tile movement, merging, and strategic placement.\n\n### Game Board Analysis\nThe current 4x4 grid is:\n```\nRow 1: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 4: 0|0|0|0  \n```\nAll non-zero tiles (three 2s) are in column 4 (rightmost column), with row 4 in column 4 being empty.\n\n### Evaluation of Directions\n1. **RIGHT**: Swiping right would not move any tiles, as the 2s are already in the rightmost position of their rows. No movement means this is an invalid move.  \n2. **LEFT**: Swiping left shifts all tiles to the left. Each row with a 2 would become `[2,0,0,0]` (rows 1-3), and row 4 remains `[0,0,0,0]`. No merging occurs, so no score is gained. This is a valid move but not optimal.  \n3. **UP**: Swiping up affects column 4. The tiles in column 4 are `[2,2,2,0]` (top to bottom).  \n   - Step 1: Shift all tiles up → `[2,2,2,0]` (no gaps).  \n   - Step 2: Merge adjacent tiles from top to bottom. The first two 2s (row 1 and row 2) merge into 4 (score +4). The third 2 (row 3) shifts up to row 2 (since row 2 is now empty after merging).  \n   - Resulting column 4: `[4,2,0,0]`.  \n   The grid becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 1: 0|0|0|4  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|2  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 4: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   This is a valid move with a score gain of 4, and the 4 is positioned in the top-right corner (a strategic corner for future merges).  \n\n4. **DOWN**: Swiping down affects column 4. The tiles in column 4 are `[2,2,2,0]` (top to bottom).  \n   - Step 1: Shift all tiles down → `[0,2,2,2]` (no gaps).  \n   - Step 2: Merge adjacent tiles from bottom to top. The bottom two 2s (row 4 and row 3) merge into 4 (score +4). The third 2 (row 2) shifts down to row 3 (since row 3 is now empty after merging).  \n   - Resulting column 4: `[0,0,2,4]`.  \n   The grid becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|2  \n   Row 4: 0|0|0|4  \n   ```  \n   This is also a valid move with a score gain of 4, but the 4 is positioned in the bottom-right corner.  \n\n### Strategic Choice\nBoth UP and DOWN are valid and yield a score of 4. However, positioning the merged 4 in the top-right corner (UP) aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners, which facilitates future merges (e.g., if a new 2 is added below the 2 in row 2, column 4, swiping up again can merge the 2s into 4, then with the top 4 into 8).  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the potential outcomes of each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|2|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Each row shifts tiles to the left.  \n   - Row 0: `[0,0,0,4]` → `[4,0,0,0]` (4 moves to column 0).  \n   - Row 1: `[0,0,0,2]` → `[2,0,0,0]` (2 moves to column 0).  \n   - Row 2: `[0,0,2,0]` → `[2,0,0,0]` (2 moves to column 0).  \n   - Row 3: All zeros remain.  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     4|0|0|0  \n     2|0|0|0  \n     2|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - No merges occur, but the 4 (largest tile) is moved to the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and the two 2s are aligned vertically in column 0, setting up for a potential merge in the next move (e.g., UP).\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row shifts tiles to the right.  \n   - Row 0: `[0,0,0,4]` → remains `[0,0,0,4]` (4 stays in column 3).  \n   - Row 1: `[0,0,0,2]` → remains `[0,0,0,2]` (2 stays in column 3).  \n   - Row 2: `[0,0,2,0]` → `[0,0,0,2]` (2 moves to column 3).  \n   - Row 3: All zeros remain.  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     0|0|0|4  \n     0|0|0|2  \n     0|0|0|2  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - No merges occur. The 4 remains in the top-right corner, and the two 2s are aligned vertically in column 3. However, this leaves the 4 isolated without immediate merging potential.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns shift tiles upward.  \n   - Column 0-1: All zeros, no change.  \n   - Column 2: `[0,0,2,0]` → `[2,0,0,0]` (2 moves to row 0).  \n   - Column 3: `[4,2,0,0]` → remains `[4,2,0,0]` (4 and 2 stay in rows 0 and 1).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     0|0|2|4  \n     0|0|0|2  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - No merges occur. The 4 and 2 are spread out, with no clear setup for future merges.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns shift tiles downward.  \n   - Column 0-1: All zeros, no change.  \n   - Column 2: `[0,0,2,0]` → `[0,0,0,2]` (2 moves to row 3).  \n   - Column 3: `[4,2,0,0]` → `[0,0,2,4]` (4 moves to row 3, 2 moves to row 2).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|2  \n     0|0|2|4  \n     ```  \n   - No merges occur. The 4 is in the bottom-right corner, but the 2s are not aligned for immediate merging.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving **LEFT** strategically positions the largest tile (4) in the top-left corner (a corner, which is optimal for future merging) and aligns the two 2s vertically in column 0, creating a setup for a potential merge in the next move (e.g., UP). This is better than other directions, which either leave tiles scattered or fail to optimize corner placement.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The current game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|0|0\nRow 1: 2|0|0|0\nRow 2: 2|0|0|2\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: `[4,0,0,0]` shifts left to `[4,0,0,0]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: `[2,0,0,0]` shifts left to `[2,0,0,0]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: `[2,0,0,2]` shifts left, causing the two 2s to merge into 4 (score +4). The row becomes `[4,0,0,0]`.  \n   - Row 3: Remains `[0,0,0,0]`.  \n   Resulting board after LEFT:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 4|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 2|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 4|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   The 4s in Row 0 and Row 2 (Column 0) are vertically separated by a 2 in Row 1, preventing immediate merging in subsequent moves.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: `[4,0,0,0]` shifts right to `[0,0,0,4]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: `[2,0,0,0]` shifts right to `[0,0,0,2]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: `[2,0,0,2]` shifts right, causing the two 2s to merge into 4 (score +4). The row becomes `[0,0,0,4]`.  \n   - Row 3: Remains `[0,0,0,0]`.  \n   Resulting board after RIGHT:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|4  \n   Row 1: 0|0|0|2  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|4  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   Tiles are spread to the right, making it harder to merge larger tiles in subsequent moves.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: `[4,2,2,0]` shifts up. The two 2s (Row 1 and Row 2) merge into 4 (score +4). The column becomes `[4,4,0,0]`.  \n   - Column 3: `[0,0,2,0]` shifts up, with the 2 moving to Row 0, Column 3.  \n   Resulting board after UP:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 4|0|0|2  \n   Row 1: 4|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   The 4s in Row 0 and Row 1 (Column 0) are vertically adjacent, allowing them to merge into 8 with a subsequent UP swipe. This creates a strategic chain for higher scores.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: `[4,2,2,0]` shifts down. The two 2s (Row 1 and Row 2) merge into 4 (score +4). The column becomes `[0,0,4,4]`.  \n   - Column 3: `[0,0,2,0]` shifts down, with the 2 moving to Row 3, Column 3.  \n   Resulting board after DOWN:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 4|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 4|0|0|2  \n   ```  \n   The 4s in Row 2 and Row 3 (Column 0) are vertically adjacent but less centralized compared to the UP swipe outcome, making subsequent merges less efficient.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nThe UP swipe positions the 4s in Column 0 (Row 0 and Row 1) to merge into 8 with a subsequent UP swipe, creating a strategic chain for higher scores. This aligns with the goal of keeping larger tiles in a corner and merging smaller tiles effectively.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|2|2\nRow 1: 4|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [4,0,2,2] → Tiles shift left. The 2s merge into 4, resulting in [4,4,0,0]. Score += 4.  \n   - Row 1: [4,0,0,0] → Shifts left to [4,0,0,0]. No merge.  \n   - Rows 2-3: No change.  \n   - *Result*: Limited merging (only 2s in Row 0), score +4.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [4,0,2,2] → Tiles shift right. The 2s merge into 4, resulting in [0,0,4,4]. Score += 4.  \n   - Row 1: [4,0,0,0] → Shifts right to [0,0,0,4]. No merge.  \n   - Rows 2-3: No change.  \n   - *Result*: Similar to LEFT, with merging only in Row 0, score +4.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: [4 (Row0), 4 (Row1), 0, 0] → Tiles shift up. The 4s merge into 8, resulting in [8,0,0,0]. Score += 8.  \n   - Column 1: [0,0,0,0] → No change.  \n   - Column 2: [2 (Row0), 0, 0, 0] → Shifts up to [2,0,0,0].  \n   - Column 3: [2 (Row0), 0, 0, 0] → Shifts up to [2,0,0,0].  \n   - *Result*: Merges 4s in Column 0 for a higher score (+8), with 8 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner).  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: [4 (Row0), 4 (Row1), 0, 0] → Tiles shift down. The 4s merge into 8, resulting in [0,0,0,8]. Score += 8.  \n   - Column 1: [0,0,0,0] → No change.  \n   - Column 2: [2 (Row0), 0, 0, 0] → Shifts down to [0,0,0,2].  \n   - Column 3: [2 (Row0), 0, 0, 0] → Shifts down to [0,0,0,2].  \n   - *Result*: Merges 4s in Column 0 for the same score (+8), but 8 is in the bottom-left corner.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:  \nBoth UP and DOWN yield the same score, but UP places the largest tile (8) in the top-left corner, a common strategic corner for building higher tiles. This position allows easier merging of smaller tiles (2s in Row 0) in subsequent moves (e.g., a LEFT swipe could merge the 2s in Row 0). Thus, UP is more advantageous.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and the goal of merging tiles to maximize scores and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|2|2  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n```\n\n### Direction Evaluation:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift left. The 2s in columns 2 and 3 merge into 4 (score +4). Row 0 becomes `8|4|0|0`.  \n   - Rows 1, 2, 3: No merges (Row 2 remains `2|0|0|0`; Rows 1 and 3 stay empty).  \n   - Result: Merges 2s into 4, keeping the largest tile (8) in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for future merges).  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift right. The 2s in columns 2 and 3 merge into 4 (score +4). Row 0 becomes `0|0|8|4`.  \n   - Row 2: The 2 in column 0 shifts right to column 3, becoming `0|0|0|2`.  \n   - Result: Merges 2s into 4, but the largest tile (8) moves to column 2, leaving it less centralized in a corner.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: The 8 (Row 0) and 2 (Row 2) shift up but do not merge (different values). Column 0 becomes `8|2|0|0`.  \n   - Columns 1-3: No merges (all other tiles are 0).  \n   - Result: No merges, just shifts tiles upward with no score gain.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: The 8 (Row 0) and 2 (Row 2) shift down but do not merge (different values). Column 0 becomes `0|0|2|8`.  \n   - Columns 1-3: No merges (all other tiles are 0).  \n   - Result: No merges, just shifts tiles downward with no score gain.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the best move.

Score +16.  \n   - Row 1: [2, 0, 0, 4] → Tiles shift left to [2, 4, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 0] → No change.  \n   - Row 3: [2, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift left to [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Resulting board after LEFT:  \n     ```\n     16|0|0|0  \n     2|4|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     2|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - This move merges the 8s for 16 points and positions the 16 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for large tiles).\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [8, 8, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right, merging the two 8s into 16. Row 0 becomes [0, 0, 0, 16]. Score +16.  \n   - Row 1: [2, 0, 0, 4] → Tiles shift right to [0, 0, 2, 4] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 0] → No change.  \n   - Row 3: [2, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right to [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merge).  \n   - Resulting board after RIGHT:  \n     ```\n     0|0|0|16  \n     0|0|2|4  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|2  \n     ```  \n   - This move also merges the 8s for 16 points but positions the 16 in the top-right corner.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: [8, 2, 0, 2] → Tiles shift up, merging the two 2s into 4. Column 0 becomes [8, 4, 0, 0]. Score +4.  \n   - Column 1: [8, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift up to [8, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: [0, 4, 0, 0] → Tiles shift up to [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Resulting board after UP:  \n     ```\n     8|8|0|4  \n     4|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - Only 4 points are gained, making this less optimal.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: [8, 2, 0, 2] → Tiles shift down, merging the two 2s into 4. Column 0 becomes [0, 0, 8, 4]. Score +4.  \n   - Column 1: [8, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift down to [0, 0, 0, 8] (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: [0, 4, 0, 0] → Tiles shift down to [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merge).  \n   - Resulting board after DOWN:  \n     ```\n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     8|0|0|0  \n     4|8|0|4  \n     ```  \n   - Only 4 points are gained, making this the least optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the 8s for 16 points, but LEFT positions the 16 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and leaves smaller tiles (2, 4, 2) in positions that could enable future merges (e.g., merging the 2s in column 0 with a subsequent UP move). Thus, LEFT is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|0|0|0\nRow 1: 2|4|0|8\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 2|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all non-zero tiles in each row are distinct).  \n   - Resulting board has minimal changes, no score gain.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (non-zero tiles remain distinct).  \n   - Resulting board has minimal changes, no score gain.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift upward. In column 0, the 2 (row 1) and 2 (row 3) merge into 4 (score +4).  \n   - Column 1: 4 (row 1) shifts to row 0.

The game board is:\n\n```\n16|4|0|8\n4|0|8|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: Tiles `16, 4, 0, 8` shift left to `16, 4, 8, 0` (no merges, as 16, 4, 8 are distinct).  \n- Row 1: Tiles `4, 0, 8, 0` shift left to `4, 8, 0, 0` (no merges).  \n- Rows 2 and 3 remain empty.  \n- Result: Tiles cluster left but no merges occur. Larger tiles (16) stay in the top-left corner, but no immediate merging opportunities.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: Tiles `16, 4, 0, 8` shift right to `0, 16, 4, 8` (no merges).  \n- Row 1: Tiles `4, 0, 8, 0` shift right to `0, 4, 8, 0` (no merges).  \n- Rows 2 and 3 remain empty.  \n- Result: Tiles cluster right, but 16 moves to column 1 (not a corner), reducing strategic positioning.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed vertically:  \n  - Column 0: `16, 4, 0, 0` shifts up to `16, 4, 0, 0` (no merges).  \n  - Column 1: `4, 0, 0, 0` shifts up to `4, 0, 0, 0`.  \n  - Column 2: `0, 8, 0, 0` shifts up to `8, 0, 0, 0`.  \n  - Column 3: `8, 0, 0, 0` shifts up to `8, 0, 0, 0`.  \n- Resulting board:  \n  ```\n  16|4|8|8  \n  4|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  ```  \n- Key observation: Row 0 now has adjacent 8s (columns 2 and 3). A future LEFT move would merge these 8s into 16, creating a high-value tile. The 16 remains in the top-left corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed vertically:  \n  - Column 0: `16, 4, 0, 0` shifts down to `0, 0, 16, 4` (no merges).  \n  - Column 1: `4, 0, 0, 0` shifts down to `0, 0, 0, 4`.  \n  - Column 2: `0, 8, 0, 0` shifts down to `0, 0, 0, 8`.  \n  - Column 3: `8, 0, 0, 0` shifts down to `0, 0, 0, 8`.  \n- Resulting board:  \n  ```\n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  16|0|0|0  \n  4|4|8|8  \n  ```  \n- While row 3 has adjacent 4s and 8s, these are in the same row (horizontal), and merging requires a LEFT\/RIGHT move. However, the 16 moves to row 2 (not a corner), weakening strategic positioning compared to UP.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP is the best move. It positions the 16 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and aligns two 8s in row 0 (columns 2 and 3), creating a future merging opportunity with a LEFT move. This setup maximizes long-term merging potential and adheres to the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

Less strategic for future merges compared to LEFT.\n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [16, 4, 0, 0] → Tiles shift up (no merge, different values).  \n- **Column 1**: [4, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift up (no merge).  \n- **Column 2**: [8, 0, 0, 8] → Tiles shift up. The two 8s merge into 16, resulting in [16, 0, 0, 0]. Score +16.  \n- **Column 3**: [8, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift up (no merge).  \n- **Resulting Board**:  \n  ```\n  16|4|16|8  \n  4|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  ```  \n- **Key Observations**: Merges 8s vertically but fills Row 0 completely, reducing flexibility for future moves.\n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [16, 4, 0, 0] → Tiles shift down (no merge, different values).  \n- **Column 1**: [4, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift down to [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merge).  \n- **Column 2**: [8, 0, 0, 8] → Tiles shift down.

It merges adjacent 8s in Row 0, creates a 16, and retains empty spaces (e.g., Row 0, Column 3) for future tiles. Larger tiles (16s) remain in the top row, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

This clears the space between the two 16s in Row 0, setting up for a potential merge in future moves (e.g., a subsequent LEFT swipe could merge the 16s).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN swipe is optimal because it moves the 4 in Row 0, Column 1 out of the way, creating space between the two 16s in Row 0.

RIGHT:\n- Tiles shift to the right, filling empty spaces on the right side of each row.\n  - Row 0: `16|8|4|0` → `0|16|8|4` (tiles shift right into empty spaces).\n  - Row 1: `4|16|8|0` → `0|4|16|8` (tiles shift right).\n  - Row 2: `16|0|0|0` → `0|0|0|16` (16 shifts to the rightmost column).\n  - Row 3: `2|0|0|0` → `0|0|0|2` (2 shifts to the rightmost column).\n- This consolidates larger tiles (16, 8, 4) toward the right edge, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner (e.g., bottom-right). **Valid move**.\n\n\n#### 3. UP:\n- Tiles in each column are already as far up as possible (no empty spaces above non-zero tiles). \n- No tiles can move up. **Invalid move**.\n\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- Tiles shift down, filling empty spaces at the bottom of each column.\n  - Column 1: `8|16|0|0` → `0|0|8|16` (8 and 16 shift down).\n  - Column 2: `4|8|0|0` → `0|0|4|8` (4 and 8 shift down).\n  - Columns 0 and 3 remain unchanged (no empty spaces to shift into).\n- This scatters larger tiles across lower rows but does not consolidate them into a single corner as effectively as RIGHT. **Valid move but less strategic**.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT is the best move. It consolidates larger tiles (16, 8, 4) toward the right edge, positioning them for potential future merges in the bottom-right corner, a key strategic position.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to position larger tiles strategically (preferably in a corner) and set up for future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|16|8|4\nRow 1: 0|4|16|8\nRow 2: 4|0|0|16\nRow 3: 0|0|0|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     Row 0: 16|8|4|0  \n     Row 1: 4|16|8|0  \n     Row 2: 4|16|0|0  \n     Row 3: 2|0|0|0  \n   - Larger tiles (16s) are scattered in the left half but not clustered in a corner.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     Row 0: 0|16|8|4  \n     Row 1: 0|4|16|8  \n     Row 2: 0|0|4|16  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|2  \n   - Larger tiles (16s) align diagonally: (0,1), (1,2), (2,3). This diagonal trends toward the **bottom-right corner**, a strategic position for clustering large tiles.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift up, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in columns are distinct).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     Row 0: 4|16|8|4  \n     Row 1: 0|4|16|8  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|16  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|2  \n   - Larger tiles remain spread out, with no clear clustering in a corner.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in columns are distinct).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     Row 0: 0|0|0|4  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|8  \n     Row 2: 0|16|8|16  \n     Row 3: 4|4|16|2  \n   - Larger tiles are scattered across the board, with no clear corner clustering.\n\n### Key Insight:\nSwiping **RIGHT** aligns the 16s diagonally toward the bottom-right corner. This positions larger tiles in a corner, a common strategy to avoid blocking future merges and maintain flexibility. The diagonal arrangement of 16s (0,1), (1,2), (2,3) sets up potential future merges if additional 16s appear in the bottom-right region.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning (keeping larger tiles in a corner).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|16|8|4\nRow 1: 0|4|16|8\nRow 2: 8|0|4|16\nRow 3: 0|0|0|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**:\n- Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct).\n- Resulting board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 16|8|4|0\n  Row 1: 4|16|8|0\n  Row 2: 8|4|16|0\n  Row 3: 2|0|0|0\n  ```\n- No merges, and tiles are grouped left, but the largest tile (16) is not in a corner.\n\n#### **RIGHT**:\n- Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct).\n- Resulting board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 0|16|8|4\n  Row 1: 0|4|16|8\n  Row 2: 0|8|4|16\n  Row 3: 0|0|0|2\n  ```\n- The largest tile (16) in Row 2, Column 3 (bottom-right corner) remains in the corner. This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners for future merges.\n\n#### **UP**:\n- Tiles shift up, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct).\n- Resulting board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 8|16|8|4\n  Row 1: 0|4|16|8\n  Row 2: 0|0|4|16\n  Row 3: 0|0|0|2\n  ```\n- Largest tiles (16s) are scattered, not concentrated in a corner.\n\n#### **DOWN**:\n- Tiles shift down, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct).\n- Resulting board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 0|0|0|4\n  Row 1: 0|0|8|8\n  Row 2: 0|4|16|16\n  Row 3: 8|16|4|2\n  ```\n- While some tiles group at the bottom, the largest tile (16 in Row 2, Column 3) is not strongly reinforced in a corner.\n\n### Strategic Decision:\nThe key strategy is to keep the largest tiles in a corner for future merges. The 16 in Row 2, Column 3 (bottom-right corner) is already in a corner. Swiping RIGHT preserves this corner position and keeps tiles aligned toward the right, making it easier to merge future tiles into the corner.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, consolidating large tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|16|8|4\nRow 1: 0|4|16|8\nRow 2: 8|8|4|16\nRow 3: 0|0|0|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: `[0,16,8,4]` shifts left to `[16,8,4,0]` (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: `[0,4,16,8]` shifts left to `[4,16,8,0]` (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: `[8,8,4,16]` shifts left: the two `8`s merge into `16` (score +16), resulting in `[16,4,16,0]`.\n- **Row 3**: `[0,0,0,2]` shifts left to `[2,0,0,0]` (no merges).\n\n**Resulting Board**:\n```\nRow 0: 16|8|4|0\nRow 1: 4|16|8|0\nRow 2: 16|4|16|0\nRow 3: 2|0|0|0\n```\n- **Key Outcome**: Merges the two `8`s in Row 2, gaining 16 points. Larger tiles (16s) consolidate toward the left edge, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: `[0,16,8,4]` shifts right (no movement, remains `[0,16,8,4]`).\n- **Row 1**: `[0,4,16,8]` shifts right (no movement, remains `[0,4,16,8]`).\n- **Row 2**: `[8,8,4,16]` shifts right: the two `8`s merge into `16` (score +16), resulting in `[0,16,4,16]` (after reversing and processing as a left swipe).\n- **Row 3**: `[0,0,0,2]` shifts right (no movement, remains `[0,0,0,2]`).\n\n**Resulting Board**:\n```\nRow 0: 0|16|8|4\nRow 1: 0|4|16|8\nRow 2: 0|16|4|16\nRow 3: 0|0|0|2\n```\n- **Key Outcome**: Merges the two `8`s in Row 2, gaining 16 points. However, larger tiles (16s) spread toward the right edge, which is less consolidated than the left-aligned outcome of the LEFT swipe.\n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift upward in columns. No merges occur because all adjacent tiles in columns are distinct. The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain. This is suboptimal.\n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift downward in columns. No merges occur because all adjacent tiles in columns are distinct. The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain. This is also suboptimal.\n\n\n### Strategic Evaluation:\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT swipes merge the two `8`s in Row 2, but LEFT consolidates larger tiles (16s) toward the left edge, a corner, which aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner for future merges. RIGHT spreads 16s toward the right edge, which is less consolidated. Thus, LEFT is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify a move that sets up future merges and follows the strategy of grouping larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|8|4|0\nRow 1: 4|16|8|0\nRow 2: 16|4|16|0\nRow 3: 2|0|0|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Each row shifts left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). The board remains largely unchanged, with minimal reorganization of tiles. No score gain.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Each row shifts right, but again, no merges occur (adjacent tiles are distinct). Tiles spread out to the right, but no meaningful grouping of larger tiles (e.g., 16s) is achieved. No score gain.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Columns shift upward, but no merges occur (adjacent tiles in columns are distinct). The board remains identical to the original state, as no tiles move into new positions. No score gain.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Columns shift downward, reorganizing tiles to the bottom of each column. Key observations:  \n   - Column 1 (originally `8|16|4|0`) shifts to `0|8|16|4`, placing `16` in Row 2, Column 1.  \n   - Column 0 (originally `16|4|16|2`) remains mostly unchanged but retains `16` in Row 2, Column 0.  \n   - After the down swipe, Row 2 becomes `16|16|8|0`, where two `16`s are now adjacent. This sets up a future left swipe to merge these `16`s into a `32`, creating a strategic advantage.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN swipe reorganizes the board to group two `16`s in Row 2, enabling a potential merge in the next move. This aligns with the strategy of positioning larger tiles for future combinations.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given game board:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|0|0|0\nRow 1: 4|8|4|4\nRow 2: 16|16|8|0\nRow 3: 2|4|16|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: `16|0|0|0` → No merges (tiles shift left, remains `16|0|0|0`).\n- **Row 1**: `4|8|4|4` → Tiles shift left, and the two trailing `4`s merge into `8`. New row: `4|8|8|0` (score +8).\n- **Row 2**: `16|16|8|0` → The two `16`s merge into `32`. New row: `32|8|0|0` (score +32).\n- **Row 3**: `2|4|16|8` → No merges (tiles are already left-aligned). New row: `2|4|16|8`.\n\n**Total Score**: 8 + 32 = 40.  \n**Post-Move Board**:  \n```\n16|0|0|0  \n4|8|8|0  \n32|8|0|0  \n2|4|16|8  \n```\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: `16|0|0|0` → Tiles shift right, `16` moves to the rightmost position. New row: `0|0|0|16`.\n- **Row 1**: `4|8|4|4` → Tiles shift right, and the two trailing `4`s merge into `8`. New row: `0|4|8|8` (score +8).\n- **Row 2**: `16|16|8|0` → The two `16`s merge into `32`, shifting right. New row: `0|0|32|8` (score +32).\n- **Row 3**: `2|4|16|8` → No merges (tiles are already right-aligned). New row: `2|4|16|8`.\n\n**Total Score**: 8 + 32 = 40.  \n**Post-Move Board**:  \n```\n0|0|0|16  \n0|4|8|8  \n0|0|32|8  \n2|4|16|8  \n```\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed, but no adjacent equal tiles merge. Tiles shift upward but no merges occur.  \n**Total Score**: 0.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed, but no adjacent equal tiles merge. Tiles shift downward but no merges occur.  \n**Total Score**: 0.\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 40 points, but LEFT is preferable. After a LEFT swipe, the largest merged tile (`32`) is positioned in the top-left corner (row 2, column 0), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners. This setup allows future merges to build toward the corner, whereas RIGHT places the `32` in the middle-right (row 2, column 2), which is less strategic.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges, score, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|8|0|0\nRow 1: 4|8|8|0\nRow 2: 32|8|0|0\nRow 3: 2|4|16|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [16, 8, 0, 0] → No merges (tiles shift left, no adjacent duplicates).  \n- **Row 1**: [4, 8, 8, 0] → The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). Result: [4, 16, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 8, 0, 0] → No merges.  \n- **Row 3**: [2, 4, 16, 8] → No merges (all distinct).  \n- **Outcome**: Only one merge (8+8=16) in Row 1. Larger tiles (32, 16) are scattered, with limited future merge potential.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [16, 8, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right: [0, 0, 16, 8]. No merges.  \n- **Row 1**: [4, 8, 8, 0] → The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). Result: [0, 4, 16, 0].  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 8, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right: [0, 0, 32, 8]. No merges.  \n- **Row 3**: [2, 4, 16, 8] → No merges (all distinct).  \n- **Outcome**: Only one merge (8+8=16) in Row 1. Larger tiles are pushed right, but empty spaces are fragmented, reducing future options.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [16, 4, 32, 2] → All distinct. No merges.  \n- **Column 1**: [8, 8, 8, 4] → The top two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). Remaining 8 shifts up, resulting in [16, 8, 4, 0].  \n- **Column 2**: [0, 8, 0, 16] → Tiles shift up: [8, 16, 0, 0]. No merges.  \n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 0, 8] → Tiles shift up: [8, 0, 0, 0]. No merges.  \n- **Outcome**: One merge (8+8=16) in Column 1. The resulting board after UP is:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 16|16|8|8  \n  Row 1: 4|8|16|0  \n  Row 2: 32|4|0|0  \n  Row 3: 2|0|0|0  \n  ```  \n  This positions two 16s in Row 0 (adjacent), which can merge into a 32 with a subsequent LEFT swipe. The 32 in Row 2, Column 0 remains in a corner, aligning with the strategy of concentrating large tiles.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [16, 4, 32, 2] → All distinct. No merges.  \n- **Column 1**: [8, 8, 8, 4] → The bottom two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). Remaining 8 shifts down, resulting in [0, 8, 16, 4].  \n- **Column 2**: [0, 8, 0, 16] → Tiles shift down: [0, 0, 8, 16]. No merges.  \n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 0, 8] → No merges.  \n- **Outcome**: One merge (8+8=16) in Column 1. Larger tiles (32, 16) are spread out, with fewer adjacent duplicates for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe **UP** direction is optimal. It merges 8s in Column 1, positions two 16s adjacently in Row 0 (enabling a future 32 merge), and keeps the 32 in a corner. This setup maximizes strategic potential for higher scores.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, score gain, and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|16|8|8\nRow 1: 4|8|16|0\nRow 2: 32|4|0|0\nRow 3: 2|8|0|0\n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `16|16|8|8` shift left.

Result: `0|0|2|8`.\n- **Score Gain**: 16 + 32 = 48 (same as LEFT).\n- **Strategic Placement**: Larger tiles (32, 16) spread across the right side, less concentrated in a corner.\n\n### UP\/DOWN Moves:\n- **UP**: Columns are processed upward, but no adjacent equal tiles exist to merge. No score gain.\n- **DOWN**: Columns are processed downward, but no adjacent equal tiles exist to merge. No score gain.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 48 points, but LEFT consolidates larger tiles (32, 16) in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future merges. UP and DOWN provide no score and are suboptimal.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile positioning.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|16|0|0\nRow 1: 4|8|16|0\nRow 2: 32|4|2|0\nRow 3: 2|8|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Each row shifts tiles to the left. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any row, so no merges occur. However, tiles remain clustered on the left, keeping larger tiles (32, 16) in the left corner, which aligns with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner for future merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row shifts tiles to the right. No merges occur, but tiles spread toward the right edge. This disperses larger tiles (e.g., 32, 16 in Row 0) away from the left corner, which is less strategic.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns shift tiles upward. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column, so no merges occur. Larger tiles (32 in Column 0) remain spread vertically (Row 0 and Row 2), with a 4 in between, preventing potential future merges.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns shift tiles downward. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column, so no merges occur. Larger tiles (32 in Column 0) remain spread vertically (Row 0 and Row 2), with a 4 and 2 below, leaving them misaligned for future merges.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe key strategy is to keep larger tiles in a corner to facilitate future merges. Moving LEFT maintains the 32 and 16 tiles in the left corner (Row 0), preserving their position for potential future merges. Other directions either disperse large tiles or leave them misaligned.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and the goal of setting up future merges and maximizing score potential. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 32|16|0|8\nRow 1: 4|8|16|0\nRow 2: 32|4|2|0\nRow 3: 2|8|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left in each row. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. The resulting grid would have tiles shifted left but no score gain.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right in each row. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. The resulting grid would have tiles shifted right but no score gain.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift up in each column. While no vertical merges occur immediately, this move strategically positions tiles for future merges. Notably, in Column 2 (originally `0|16|2|0`), shifting up moves the `16` (row 1) to row 0 and the `2` (row 2) to row 1. This results in Row 0 becoming `32|16|16|8`, where two `16`s are now horizontally adjacent in row 0 (columns 1 and 2). This sets up a potential merge for a subsequent LEFT swipe, where these `16`s can combine into a `32`, generating score.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down in each column. No merges occur, and the resulting grid does not meaningfully position tiles for future merges. Larger tiles remain scattered, reducing strategic potential.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP move is optimal because it positions two `16`s horizontally adjacent in row 0, creating a future merge opportunity with a LEFT swipe. This aligns with the strategy of grouping smaller tiles to facilitate larger merges and maintain control over the grid.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize merges and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|16|16|8\nRow 1: 4|8|2|0\nRow 2: 32|4|8|0\nRow 3: 2|8|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). Result: `32|32|8|0`.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles shift left (no merges). Result: `4|8|2|0`.  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles shift left (no merges). Result: `32|4|8|0`.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles shift left (no merges). Result: `2|8|0|0`.  \n   - Outcome: Merges 16+16 into 32, consolidating larger tiles (32s) on the left, which aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). Result: `0|32|32|8`.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles shift right (no merges). Result: `0|4|8|2`.  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles shift right (no merges). Result: `0|32|4|8`.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles shift right (no merges). Result: `0|0|2|8`.  \n   - Outcome: Merges 16+16 into 32 but scatters larger tiles (32s) across the row, less optimal for corner consolidation.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift up, but no merges occur, and no tiles move into empty spaces (tiles are already as far up as possible). This is an invalid move.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift down, but no merges occur. For example, the 8 in Row 0, Column 3 moves to Row 3, Column 3, and other tiles shift down but do not merge. This results in no score gain and less strategic tile alignment.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe merges tiles (gaining 32 points) and consolidates larger tiles (32s) on the left, which is optimal for corner strategy. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given game board. The goal is to maximize score and strategically position larger tiles (preferably in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|32|8|0  \nRow 1: 4|8|2|0  \nRow 2: 32|4|8|0  \nRow 3: 2|8|4|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   - **Row 0**: `32|32|8|0` → The two 32s merge into 64 (score +64), then 8 shifts left. Result: `64|8|0|0`.  \n   - **Rows 1-3**: No adjacent equal tiles, so tiles shift left but do not merge. Rows remain `4|8|2|0`, `32|4|8|0`, and `2|8|4|0`.  \n   - **Outcome**: 64 score, with the largest tile (64) positioned in the top-left corner (a strategic corner). Empty spaces are on the right, allowing future merges to the left.\n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - **Row 0**: `32|32|8|0` → Reversed, processed as `0|8|32|32`, which merges the 32s into 64. Reversed back: `0|64|8|0` (score +64).  \n   - **Rows 1-3**: No merges; tiles shift right but remain unchanged.  \n   - **Outcome**: 64 score, but the 64 is in column 1 (not a corner), which is less strategic.\n\n3. **UP\/DOWN Moves**:  \n   - **Columns 0-2**: No adjacent equal tiles in any column. Tiles shift but do not merge.  \n   - **Outcome**: 0 score. No meaningful tile positioning or merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the best move. It merges the 32s in Row 0 to create a 64 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and retains empty spaces for future merges. RIGHT also merges the 32s but positions the 64 non-optimally. UP and DOWN yield no score.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up future merges by keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 8 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 4 | 8 | 2 | 0  \nRow 2: 32 | 4 | 8 | 0  \nRow 3: 2 | 8 | 4 | 8  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles merge (all non-zero tiles are already left-aligned with no duplicates). No score gained. Poor for future merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles merge (non-zero tiles are not aligned to merge). No score gained. Poor for future merges.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift upward. Key merges occur in **Column 1** (values: 8, 8, 4, 8). The top two 8s merge into 16 (score += 16). After merging, the board becomes:  \n   - Row 0: 64 | 16 | 2 | 8  \n   - Row 1: 4 | 4 | 8 | 0 (adjacent 4s, potential merge in future moves)  \n   - Row 2: 32 | 8 | 4 | 0  \n   - Row 3: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   This setup keeps the largest tile (64) in the top-left corner, with 16 adjacent to it, supporting future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift downward. Key merges occur in **Column 1** (values: 8, 8, 4, 8). The bottom two 8s merge into 16 (score += 16). After merging, the board becomes:  \n   - Row 0: 64 | 16 | 2 | 0  \n   - Row 1: 4 | 4 | 8 | 0 (adjacent 4s)  \n   - Row 2: 32 | 8 | 4 | 0  \n   - Row 3: 2 | 0 | 0 | 8  \n   While this also merges 8s, the 8 in the bottom-right corner (Row 3, Column 3) is less strategic than having it in the top-right (Row 0, Column 3) from the UP swipe.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP swipe merges 8s into 16 (score gain) and positions the largest tile (64) in the top-left corner, with smaller tiles arranged to support future merges (e.g., adjacent 4s in Row 1). This is more strategic than DOWN.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the potential merges, score gains, and strategic positioning of tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 16 | 2 | 8  \nRow 1: 4 | 4 | 8 | 0  \nRow 2: 32 | 8 | 4 | 0  \nRow 3: 2 | 0 | 16 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles (64, 16, 2, 8) are distinct and shift left with no merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (4, 4, 8, 0) shift left. The two 4s merge into 8, resulting in [8, 8, 0, 0]. Score gain: 8.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (32, 8, 4, 0) shift left with no merges (distinct values).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles (2, 0, 16, 0) shift left to [2, 16, 0, 0] with no merges.  \n\nResulting board after LEFT:  \nRow 0: 64 | 16 | 2 | 8  \nRow 1: 8 | 8 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 32 | 8 | 4 | 0  \nRow 3: 2 | 16 | 0 | 0  \n\nScore gain: 8.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles (64, 16, 2, 8) shift right with no merges (distinct values).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (4, 4, 8, 0) shift right. The two 4s merge into 8, resulting in [0, 0, 8, 8]. Score gain: 8.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (32, 8, 4, 0) shift right to [0, 32, 8, 4] with no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles (2, 0, 16, 0) shift right to [0, 0, 2, 16] with no merges.  \n\nResulting board after RIGHT:  \nRow 0: 64 | 16 | 2 | 8  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 8 | 8  \nRow 2: 0 | 32 | 8 | 4  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 2 | 16  \n\nScore gain: 8.\n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- All columns (64, 4, 32, 2; 16, 4, 8, 0; 2, 8, 4, 16; 8, 0, 0, 0) contain distinct values or non-adjacent duplicates. No merges occur, and tiles shift up with no score gain.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- All columns (64, 4, 32, 2; 16, 4, 8, 0; 2, 8, 4, 16; 8, 0, 0, 0) contain distinct values or non-adjacent duplicates. No merges occur, and tiles shift down with no score gain.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:  \nBoth LEFT and RIGHT yield 8 points, but LEFT positions merged tiles (8s in Row 1) closer to the top-left corner (where the largest tile, 64, is located). This aligns with the strategy of clustering large tiles in a corner for future merges. For example, a subsequent LEFT swipe could merge the 8s in Row 1 into 16, further building the corner cluster.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges, maintain larger tiles in corners, and set up future opportunities.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 16 | 2 | 8\nRow 1: 8 | 8 | 0 | 32\nRow 2: 32 | 8 | 4 | 0\nRow 3: 2 | 16 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles (64, 16, 2, 8) have no adjacent duplicates; no merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (8, 8, 0, 32) shift left, merging the two 8s into 16. New row: `16 | 32 | 0 | 0` (score +16).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (32, 8, 4, 0) shift left with no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles (2, 16, 0, 0) shift left with no merges.  \n- **Result**: 1 merge (16 points). Larger tiles (64, 32) remain spread out; limited future merge potential.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles (64, 16, 2, 8) have no adjacent duplicates; no merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (8, 8, 0, 32) shift right, merging the two 8s into 16. New row: `0 | 0 | 16 | 32` (score +16).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (32, 8, 4, 0) shift right with no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles (2, 16, 0, 0) shift right with no merges.  \n- **Result**: 1 merge (16 points). Larger tiles (64, 32) are scattered; similar to LEFT but with fewer tiles in the left half.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles (64, 8, 32, 2) have no adjacent duplicates; no merges.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (16, 8, 8, 16) shift up. The two 8s (rows 1 and 2) merge into 16, and the 16 from row 3 shifts up. New column: `16 | 16 | 16 | 0` (score +16).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles (2, 0, 4, 0) shift up to `2 | 4 | 0 | 0` (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles (8, 32, 0, 0) shift up to `8 | 32 | 0 | 0` (no merges).  \n- **Result**: 1 merge (16 points). Column 1 now has three 16s vertically (`16 | 16 | 16 | 0`), creating strong future merge potential (e.g., merging 16s into 32s with subsequent UP swipes). The largest tile (64) remains in the top-left corner, a strategic position.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles (64, 8, 32, 2) have no adjacent duplicates; no merges.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (16, 8, 8, 16) shift down. The two 8s (rows 1 and 2) merge into 16, and the 16 from row 0 shifts down. New column: `0 | 16 | 16 | 16` (score +16).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles (2, 0, 4, 0) shift down to `0 | 0 | 2 | 4` (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles (8, 32, 0, 0) shift down to `0 | 0 | 8 | 32` (no merges).  \n- **Result**: 1 merge (16 points). While 16s are grouped in column 1, the largest tile (64) remains in the top-left, but the board has more empty spaces in the top rows, which may be less strategic for future moves.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions yield 16 points, but **UP** is optimal. It consolidates three 16s vertically in column 1, creating immediate future merge opportunities (e.g., merging 16s into 32s with another UP swipe). Additionally, the largest tile (64) stays in the top-left corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners for stability.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 16 | 2 | 8  \nRow 1: 8 | 16 | 4 | 32  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 2 | 16 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### 1.

UP Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: [64, 8, 32, 2] (no merges, distinct values).  \n- **Column 1**: [16, 16, 16, 16] (merges occur):  \n  - Top two 16s merge into 32 (score +32).  \n  - Bottom two 16s merge into 32 (score +32).  \n  - Final column 1: [32, 32, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 2**: [2, 4, 0, 0] (shifts up, no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [8, 32, 0, 0] (shifts up, no merges).  \n- **Result**: Total score gain of 64. Merged 32s in row 0 and row 1, keeping larger tiles (64, 32) in the top-left area, which aligns with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner.\n\n\n#### 4.

Poor.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: No merges (all distinct).  \n- Row 1: 32s in columns 1 and 3 shift right, merge into 64 (score +64). Row 1 becomes 8 | 4 | 64 | 0.  \n- Row 2: 32 and 8 shift right (no merge).  \n- Row 3: 2 shifts right to column 3.  \n- **Result**: 1 merge (32s → 64), score +64.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Column 0: All distinct (64, 8, 32, 2) → no merge.  \n- Column 1: 32s in rows 0 and 1 shift up, merge into 64 (score +64).

Row 0 becomes 64 | 64 | 2 | 8 (adjacent 64s, which can merge in future moves).  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Column 0: All distinct (64, 8, 32, 2) → no merge.  \n- Column 1: 32s in rows 0 and 1 shift down, merge into 64 (score +64). Column 1 becomes 0 | 0 | 0 | 64.  \n- Column 2: All distinct (2, 4, 8, 0) → no merge.  \n- Column 3: All distinct (8, 32, 0, 0) → no merge.  \n- **Result**: 1 merge (32s → 64), score +64. 64 is placed in the bottom row, less strategic for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nLEFT is invalid (no merges). RIGHT, UP, and DOWN all yield +64, but UP is optimal. After UP, row 0 has adjacent 64s (64 | 64 | 2 | 8), which can merge into 128 in the next move (e.g., LEFT), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner for future growth.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities, score gain, and strategic tile placement (e.g., cornering large tiles).\n\n### LEFT Swipe Analysis:\n- **Row 0 (64|64|2|8)**: The two 64s merge into 128 (score +128). Remaining tiles (2, 8) shift left, resulting in `128|2|8|0`.\n- **Row 1 (8|0|4|32)**: Tiles shift left with no merges, resulting in `8|4|32|0`.\n- **Row 2 (32|0|8|0)**: Tiles shift left with no merges, resulting in `32|8|0|0`.\n- **Row 3 (2|2|0|0)**: The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in `4|0|0|0`.\n\n**Resulting Board After LEFT:**  \n128|2|8|0  \n8|4|32|0  \n32|8|0|0  \n4|0|0|0  \n\n**Score Gain:** 128 + 4 = 132. The largest tile (128) is safely placed in the top-left corner, a strategic position to avoid blocking future merges.\n\n\n### RIGHT Swipe Analysis:\n- **Row 0 (64|64|2|8)**: The two 64s merge into 128 (score +128), shifting right, resulting in `0|128|2|8`.\n- **Row 1 (8|0|4|32)**: Tiles shift right with no merges, resulting in `0|8|4|32`.\n- **Row 2 (32|0|8|0)**: Tiles shift right with no merges, resulting in `0|0|32|8`.\n- **Row 3 (2|2|0|0)**: The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), shifting right, resulting in `0|0|0|4`.\n\n**Resulting Board After RIGHT:**  \n0|128|2|8  \n0|8|4|32  \n0|0|32|8  \n0|0|0|4  \n\n**Score Gain:** 128 + 4 = 132. However, the largest tile (128) is in the top-middle (0,1), which is less strategic than a corner.\n\n\n### UP Swipe Analysis:\n- Columns are processed top-to-bottom. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles shift up but remain unmerged.  \n**Resulting Board After UP:** Minimal changes, no score gain.\n\n\n### DOWN Swipe Analysis:\n- Columns are processed bottom-to-top. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles shift down but remain unmerged.  \n**Resulting Board After DOWN:** Minimal changes, no score gain.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield the same score, but LEFT places the largest tile (128) in the top-left corner, a key strategic position to maximize future merging opportunities. UP and DOWN provide no score gain and are suboptimal.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (keeping large tiles in a corner and enabling future merges). The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 128|2|8|0\nRow 1: 8|4|32|0\nRow 2: 32|8|0|0\nRow 3: 4|0|2|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left in each row. No merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). The resulting board after LEFT is:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 128|2|8|0  \n   Row 1: 8|4|32|0  \n   Row 2: 32|8|0|0  \n   Row 3: 4|2|0|0  \n   ```  \n   The largest tile (128) remains in the top-left corner, and smaller tiles align toward the left, supporting future merges (e.g., 4 and 2 in Row 3 could merge with new 2\/4 tiles).\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right in each row. No merges occur. The resulting board after RIGHT is:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|128|2|8  \n   Row 1: 0|8|4|32  \n   Row 2: 0|0|32|8  \n   Row 3: 0|0|4|2  \n   ```  \n   The largest tile (128) moves to the center of Row 0, which is suboptimal (large tiles should stay in corners).\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up in each column. No merges occur. The resulting board after UP is:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 128|2|8|0  \n   Row 1: 8|4|32|0  \n   Row 2: 32|8|2|0  \n   Row 3: 4|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   The largest tile (128) stays in the top-left corner, but tiles are spread vertically, reducing alignment for future horizontal merges.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down in each column. No merges occur. The resulting board after DOWN is:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 128|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 8|2|8|0  \n   Row 2: 32|4|32|0  \n   Row 3: 4|8|2|0  \n   ```  \n   The largest tile (128) stays in the top-left corner, but smaller tiles are spread out, making future merges less straightforward.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nThe goal is to keep large tiles in a corner (here, 128 in the top-left) and align smaller tiles to enable future merges. **LEFT** best achieves this: it keeps 128 in the corner, aligns smaller tiles toward the left, and positions tiles (e.g., 4 and 2 in Row 3) for potential merges with new 2\/4 tiles. Other directions either misalign large tiles (RIGHT) or spread tiles unnecessarily (UP, DOWN).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify moves that merge tiles (to gain score) and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 2 | 8 | 0\nRow 1: 8 | 4 | 32 | 0\nRow 2: 32 | 8 | 0 | 64\nRow 3: 4 | 2 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur.  \n   Example: Row 0 becomes `128 | 2 | 8 | 0` (no change), Row 2 becomes `32 | 8 | 64 | 0` (tiles shift left into empty spaces), but no merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur.  \n   Example: Row 0 becomes `0 | 128 | 2 | 8` (tiles shift right into empty spaces), Row 2 becomes `0 | 32 | 8 | 64`, but no merges.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift up, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. No merges occur.  \n   Example: Column 3 (originally `0 | 0 | 64 | 0`) becomes `64 | 0 | 0 | 0` (64 shifts up), but no merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift down. In **Column 1** (values `2 | 4 | 8 | 2`):  \n   - The 2 in Row 0 moves down past 4 (Row 1) and 8 (Row 2) to Row 2 (since Row 3 is occupied by 2).  \n   - The 2 in Row 2 and 2 in Row 3 are now adjacent and merge into 4.  \n   This merge generates a score of 4.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly a **DOWN** swipe results in a merge (two 2s in Column 1, Rows 2 and 3 merge into 4), providing a score and improving tile alignment. Other moves do not merge tiles.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the current game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 128 | 2 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 8 | 4 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 32 | 8 | 8 | 64  \nRow 3: 4 | 2 | 32 | 64  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: 128, 2, 0, 0 → No merges (128 and 2 are different).  \n- **Row 1**: 8, 4, 0, 0 → No merges (8 and 4 are different).  \n- **Row 2**: 32, 8, 8, 64 → The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). New row: 32, 16, 64, 0.  \n- **Row 3**: 4, 2, 32, 64 → No merges (all different).  \n**Outcome**: Only 16 points from merging 8s in Row 2.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: 128, 2, 0, 0 → Tiles shift right → 0, 0, 128, 2 (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: 8, 4, 0, 0 → Tiles shift right → 0, 0, 8, 4 (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: 32, 8, 8, 64 → The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). New row: 0, 32, 16, 64.  \n- **Row 3**: 4, 2, 32, 64 → No merges (all different).  \n**Outcome**: Only 16 points from merging 8s in Row 2.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: 128, 8, 32, 4 → All different (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: 2, 4, 8, 2 → All different (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: 0, 0, 8, 32 → Tiles shift up → 8, 32, 0, 0 (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: 0, 0, 64, 64 → The two 64s merge into 128 (score +128). New column: 128, 0, 0, 0.  \n**Outcome**: 128 points from merging 64s in Column 3.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: 128, 8, 32, 4 → Tiles shift down → 4, 32, 8, 128 (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: 2, 4, 8, 2 → Possible minor merges (e.g., 2s in Row 0 and 3), but no guaranteed large merges.  \n- **Column 2**: 0, 0, 8, 32 → Tiles shift down → 0, 0, 8, 32 (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: 0, 0, 64, 64 → Tiles are already at the bottom (no merges).  \n**Outcome**: Minimal or no significant merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe results in the largest merge (64 + 64 = 128) and maximizes the score. Other moves yield much smaller or no merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential, strategic tile positioning, and future move flexibility. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 2 | 8 | 128\nRow 1: 8 | 4 | 32 | 0\nRow 2: 32 | 8 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 4 | 2 | 0 | 32\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Largest Tiles**: The two 128s are in the top corners (row 0, columns 0 and 3). Strategic play involves keeping large tiles in corners to avoid blocking merges.\n- **Merge Potential**: No immediate merges are possible in any direction, but we prioritize moves that set up future merges.\n- **Empty Spaces**: There are 4 empty tiles, so all directions are valid (tiles can shift into empty spaces).\n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. Row 3, column 3 becomes empty (32 moves to column 2).  \n   - No immediate benefit; does not set up future merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur. Rows 1, 2, and 3 gain empty spaces on the left.  \n   - 32s in row 1 (column 3) and row 3 (column 3) are aligned vertically but not adjacent. No clear future merge setup.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift up. Column 3 (originally [128, 0, 0, 32]) shifts to [128, 32, 0, 0], moving the 32 from row 3, column 3 to row 1, column 3.  \n   - After shifting, row 1 becomes [8, 4, 32, 32] (two 32s adjacent in columns 2 and 3). While these 32s do not merge in the UP move (merging occurs column-wise), they set up a future LEFT move where they can merge into 64.  \n   - This positions smaller tiles to merge toward the top, supporting the corner strategy.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down, but no merges occur. Column 2 (originally [8, 32, 0, 0]) shifts to [0, 0, 8, 32], and column 3 (originally [128, 0, 0, 32]) shifts to [0, 0, 128, 32].  \n   - No meaningful setup for future merges; large tiles (128, 32) are spread out.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move because it positions two 32s adjacently in row 1 (columns 2 and 3), setting up a future LEFT move to merge them into 64. This aligns with the strategy of grouping smaller tiles to support larger merges while keeping the largest tiles (128s) in the top corners.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128|2|8|128\nRow 1: 8|4|32|32\nRow 2: 32|8|8|0\nRow 3: 4|2|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: No merges (tiles: 128, 2, 8, 128).  \n- **Row 1**: Two 32s merge into 64 (score +64). Result: [8, 4, 64, 0].  \n- **Row 2**: Two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). Result: [32, 16, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 3**: No merges (tiles: 4, 2, 0, 0).  \n- **Total Score**: 64 + 16 = 80.  \n- **Tile Placement**: Larger tiles (128, 64, 32, 16) are spread across the grid.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: No merges (tiles: 128, 2, 8, 128).  \n- **Row 1**: Two 32s merge into 64 (score +64). Result: [0, 8, 4, 64].  \n- **Row 2**: Two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). Result: [0, 0, 32, 16].  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right (no merges). Result: [0, 0, 2, 4].  \n- **Total Score**: 64 + 16 = 80.  \n- **Tile Placement**: Larger tiles (64, 32, 16, 4) cluster toward the right side, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner for future merges.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- No valid merges or tile movements (all columns are filled with non-adjacent tiles, and no empty spaces allow upward shifts). **Invalid move**.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Only one merge in Column 2 (two 8s merge into 16, score +16).  \n- **Total Score**: 16.  \n- **Tile Placement**: Larger tiles remain scattered, with minimal clustering.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT yield the same score (80), but RIGHT better aligns with the strategy of concentrating larger tiles in a corner (right side). This positions tiles for future merges, making RIGHT the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, potential merges, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128|2|8|128\nRow 1: 0|8|4|64\nRow 2: 0|16|32|16\nRow 3: 0|0|4|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **RIGHT**:  \n   All non-zero tiles in each row are already as far right as possible (no empty spaces to shift into). No tiles move, and no merges occur. **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   All non-zero tiles in each column are already as far up as possible (no empty spaces to shift into). No tiles move, and no merges occur. **Invalid move**.\n\n3. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left in each row, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). For example:  \n   - Row 1 (0|8|4|64) becomes 8|4|64|0.  \n   - Row 2 (0|16|32|16) becomes 16|32|16|0.  \n   - Row 3 (0|0|4|2) becomes 4|2|0|0.  \n   This is a valid move (tiles shift), but no merges occur. Larger tiles (e.g., 128s) remain spread out.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down in each column, creating space in the top rows and consolidating larger tiles in corners. For example:  \n   - Column 0 (128|0|0|0) becomes 0|0|0|128 (128 moves to bottom-left corner).  \n   - Column 1 (2|8|16|0) becomes 0|2|8|16 (16 moves to bottom of column 1).  \n   - Column 2 (8|4|32|4) remains 8|4|32|4 (no merges).  \n   - Column 3 (128|64|16|2) remains 128|64|16|2 (no merges).  \n   This is a valid move (tiles shift), and it strategically positions the 128 in the bottom-left corner, aligning with the goal of consolidating large tiles in corners for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move, as it shifts the 128 into the bottom-left corner (a strategic position) and creates empty space in the top rows for future moves. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential, tile alignment, and future strategic positioning. The goal is to maximize score and set up for future merges while keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: [0, 0, 8, 128]\nRow 1: [0, 2, 4, 64]\nRow 2: [64, 8, 32, 16]\nRow 3: [128, 16, 4, 2]\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift left → [8, 128, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: Tiles shift left → [2, 4, 64, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Rows 2 and 3: No empty spaces, so tiles remain unchanged (no merges).  \n   - Result: No merges, 3 empty tiles.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows have tiles already shifted right (no empty spaces to the right of non-zero tiles).  \n   - Result: No movement or merges.  \n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns 0 and 1 have no empty spaces below non-zero tiles (tiles already at the bottom).  \n   - Columns 2 and 3: Tiles are distinct and cannot merge.  \n   - Result: No movement or merges.  \n\n4. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: Tiles [0, 0, 64, 128] shift up → [64, 128, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: Tiles [0, 2, 8, 16] shift up → [2, 8, 16, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: Tiles [8, 4, 32, 4] shift up (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: Tiles [128, 64, 16, 2] shift up (no merges).  \n   - Result: No merges, but 4 empty tiles (rows 2 and 3 have more empty spaces), which provides more flexibility for future moves.  \n\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nWhile no immediate merges are possible, the UP swipe leaves more empty tiles (4) compared to LEFT (3), increasing future options. Additionally, shifting larger tiles (64, 128) upward aligns with the strategy of grouping larger tiles in a corner for potential future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate potential merges and score gains.

Key observation: Column 2 (values: 8, 4, 32, 4) has two 4s in rows 1 and 3. When shifting down, the 4 in row 1 moves past 32 (row 2) to merge with the 4 in row 3, forming an 8.  \n- This merge generates a score of 8. Other columns have no merges, but the 4s in column 2 are strategically merged.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe only move that results in a score gain is **DOWN**, as it merges the two 4s in column 2 into an 8, earning 8 points.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities, score gain, and strategic tile positioning (keeping larger tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|2|8|128  \nRow 1: 64|2|4|64  \nRow 2: 128|8|32|16  \nRow 3: 16|16|4|2  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0,2,8,128] → Shifts left to [2,8,128,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [64,2,4,64] → No merges (tiles are distinct and not adjacent).  \n- **Row 2**: [128,8,32,16] → No merges (all distinct).  \n- **Row 3**: [16,16,4,2] → Merges 16s into 32, resulting in [32,4,2,0] (score +32).  \n- **Issue**: The 128 in Row 0, Column 3 (top-right corner) shifts left to Column 2, losing its corner position.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0,2,8,128] → Shifts right (no change, 128 remains in Column 3, top-right corner).  \n- **Row 1**: [64,2,4,64] → No merges (tiles are separated by 2 and 4).  \n- **Row 2**: [128,8,32,16] → No merges (all distinct).  \n- **Row 3**: [16,16,4,2] → Merges 16s into 32, resulting in [0,32,4,2] (score +32).  \n- **Key Advantage**: The 128 in Row 0, Column 3 (top-right corner) remains in the corner, which aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [0,64,128,16] → Shifts up to [64,128,16,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [2,2,8,16] → Merges 2s into 4, resulting in [4,8,16,0] (score +4).  \n- **Other Columns**: No merges (tiles are distinct).  \n- **Issue**: Minimal score gain (only 4) and disrupts tile alignment.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [0,64,128,16] → Shifts down (no change).  \n- **Column 1**: [2,2,8,16] → Merges 2s into 4, resulting in [0,4,8,16] (score +4).  \n- **Other Columns**: No merges (tiles are distinct).  \n- **Issue**: Minimal score gain (only 4) and does not improve tile positioning.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving **RIGHT** merges the 16s in Row 3 for a score of 32 while preserving the 128 in the top-right corner (a strategic corner position).

Swiping up merges the two `2`s (row 2 and row 3) into a `4`, adding 4 to the score.  \n- Other columns have no merges.  \n- Resulting board has limited future merge potential (merged `4` in row 2, column 1 is isolated).  \n\n### DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 1 (second column)** has tiles `[4, 8, 2, 2]`. Swiping down merges the two `2`s (row 2 and row 3) into a `4`, adding 4 to the score.  \n- **Row 1** becomes `[64, 4, 4, 64]` (after column processing).

Result: 16, 128, 64, 0.  \n- **Row 2:** Tiles (0, 16, 8, 16) shift left; no merges. Result: 16, 8, 16, 0.  \n- **Row 3:** Tiles (32, 0, 0, 2) shift left; no merges. Result: 32, 2, 0, 0.  \n- **Score Gain:** 128.  \n- **Strategy:** The 128 in Row 1 (position 1) is not in a corner, limiting future merge potential.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Move:**\n- **Row 0:** Tiles (128, 32, 16, 128) are distinct; no merges.  \n- **Row 1:** Tiles (16, 64, 64, 64) merge: the last two 64s merge into 128 (score +128). Result: 16, 0, 64, 128.  \n- **Row 2:** Tiles (0, 16, 8, 16) shift right; no merges. Result: 0, 16, 8, 16.  \n- **Row 3:** Tiles (32, 0, 0, 2) shift right; no merges. Result: 0, 0, 32, 2.  \n- **Score Gain:** 128.  \n- **Strategy:** The 128 in Row 1 (position 3) is in the bottom-right corner, adjacent to the 128 in Row 0 (position 3). This positions larger tiles in a corner, enabling potential future merges (e.g., swiping UP to merge the two 128s in Column 3).  \n\n\n#### **UP Move:**\n- All columns are processed upward. No merges occur because tiles in each column are distinct.  \n- **Score Gain:** 0.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Move:**\n- All columns are processed downward. No merges occur because tiles in each column are distinct.  \n- **Score Gain:** 0.  \n\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield a score gain of 128. However, RIGHT strategically positions a 128 in the bottom-right corner (Row 1, Column 3), adjacent to the 128 in Row 0, Column 3. This setup allows for future merges (e.g., swiping UP to combine the two 128s), making RIGHT the better choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate merges, score gain, and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 128  \nRow 1: 0 | 16 | 64 | 128  \nRow 2: 2 | 16 | 8 | 16  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 32 | 2  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:  \n- Row 0: All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n- Row 1: Tiles shift left (16, 64, 128 → 16, 64, 128, 0); no merges.  \n- Row 2: Tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n- Row 3: Tiles shift left (32, 2 → 32, 2, 0, 0); no merges.  \n**Result**: No merges, minimal score gain.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n- Row 0: All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n- Row 1: Tiles shift right (0, 16, 64, 128 → 0, 16, 64, 128); no merges.  \n- Row 2: Tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n- Row 3: Tiles shift right (0, 0, 32, 2 → 0, 0, 32, 2); no merges.  \n**Result**: No merges, minimal score gain.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:  \nColumns are processed from top to bottom:  \n- **Column 0**: [128, 0, 2, 0] → Tiles shift up (128, 2, 0, 0); no merges.  \n- **Column 1**: [32, 16, 16, 0] → 16 and 16 merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in [32, 32, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 2**: [16, 64, 8, 32] → All distinct; no merges.  \n- **Column 3**: [128, 128, 16, 2] → 128 and 128 merge into 256 (score +256), resulting in [256, 16, 2, 0].  \n\n**Result**: Merges of 16+16=32 and 128+128=256 (total score +288). The 256 tile is placed in the top-right corner (row 0, column 3), a strategic corner for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:  \nColumns are processed from bottom to top:  \n- **Column 0**: [128, 0, 2, 0] → Tiles shift down (0, 0, 128, 2); no merges.  \n- **Column 1**: [32, 16, 16, 0] → 16 and 16 merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in [0, 32, 32, 0].  \n- **Column 2**: [16, 64, 8, 32] → All distinct; no merges.  \n- **Column 3**: [128, 128, 16, 2] → 128 and 128 merge into 256 (score +256), resulting in [0, 256, 16, 2].  \n\n**Result**: Merges of 16+16=32 and 128+128=256 (total score +288). However, the 256 tile is placed in row 1, column 3 (not a corner), which is less strategic than the top-right corner.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP swipe results in the same score as DOWN but strategically places the largest tile (256) in the top-right corner, aligning with the goal of keeping large tiles in corners for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the resulting merges and tile positioning.

Key observation: Column 1 (values [32, 32, 0, 0]) has two 32s that merge into 64 (score +64).  \n- Other columns:  \n  - Column 0: [128, 2, 0, 8] shifts down to [0, 128, 2, 8] (no merge).  \n  - Column 2: [16, 64, 8, 32] remains unmerged (distinct values).  \n  - Column 3: [256, 16, 2, 0] shifts down to [0, 256, 16, 2] (no merge).  \n- Result: Merges 32+32=64 (score +64). Largest tiles (128 and 256) move from corners to row 1, reducing strategic positioning.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP and DOWN both merge 32+32=64. However, UP preserves the largest tiles (128 in top-left, 256 in top-right) in corners, which is critical for future merges.

This aligns with the goal of keeping larger tiles in corners for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile placement. The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities by consolidating larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|256|32|256\nRow 1: 64|0|4|64\nRow 2: 0|0|16|32\nRow 3: 0|0|2|4\n```\nKey observations:\n- Largest tiles are 256 (row 0, cols 1 and 3) and 64 (row 1, cols 0 and 3).\n- No immediate merges are possible (no adjacent equal tiles in any row or column).\n- Valid moves require shifting tiles into empty spaces.\n\n### Direction Evaluation:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left in each row. Row 0 becomes `256|32|256|0`, row 1 becomes `64|4|64|0`, row 2 becomes `16|32|0|0`, and row 3 becomes `2|4|0|0`. No merges occur. Larger tiles (256s) spread across the top row, reducing corner consolidation.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right. Most rows remain unchanged (e.g., row 0 stays `0|256|32|256`). No movement or merges occur, making this an invalid move (no tiles shift into empty spaces).\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up in each column. Column 0 becomes `64|0|0|0`, column 1 becomes `256|0|0|0`, column 2 remains `32|4|16|2`, and column 3 remains `256|64|32|4`. No merges occur. Larger tiles (256s) stay in the top row but are not consolidated into a corner.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down in each column. Column 0 becomes `0|0|0|64` (64 moves to row 3, col 0), column 1 becomes `0|0|0|256` (256 moves to row 3, col 1), column 2 remains `32|4|16|2`, and column 3 remains `256|64|32|4`. No merges occur, but larger tiles (64 in row 3, col 0 and 256 in row 3, col 1) consolidate in the bottom row, near the bottom-left corner. The 256 in row 0, col 3 (top-right corner) remains in a corner.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nMoving **DOWN** consolidates larger tiles (64 and 256) in the bottom row, near the bottom-left corner, while preserving the 256 in the top-right corner. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners to facilitate future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

No change.  \n**Outcome**: Tiles shift left, creating empty spaces on the right. This aligns the 256 in Row 0, Column 1 with the 256 in Row 3, Column 1 vertically, setting up for a potential future merge (e.g., swiping up later could merge these 256s into 512).\n\n#### **Swipe RIGHT**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are already right-aligned. No change.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles are already right-aligned. No change.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right. `[128, 0, 16, 32]` becomes `[0, 128, 16, 32]` (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles are already right-aligned. No change.  \n**Outcome**: Minimal movement, no merges, and no strategic setup for future merges.\n\n#### **Swipe UP**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift up. `[0, 0, 128, 64]` becomes `[128, 64, 0, 0]` (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: Tiles shift up. `[0, 0, 0, 256]` becomes `[256, 0, 0, 0]` (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: Tiles are already up-aligned. No change.\n- **Column 3**: Tiles are already up-aligned. No change.  \n**Outcome**: Tiles shift up, but no merges occur, and the 256s remain misaligned for future merges.\n\n#### **Swipe DOWN**:\n- All columns are already down-aligned (non-zero tiles occupy the bottom-most positions). No tiles can move into empty spaces.  \n**Outcome**: Invalid move (no tiles shift).\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping LEFT is the best move. It shifts tiles left, aligns the two 256s vertically (Row 0, Column 1 and Row 3, Column 1), and creates empty spaces to enable future merges (e.g., a subsequent UP swipe could merge the 256s).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile alignment, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 32|256|0|0\nRow 1: 4|64|0|0\nRow 2: 128|16|32|16\nRow 3: 64|256|2|4\n```\nKey observations:\n- Empty tiles are in Row 0 (columns 2-3) and Row 1 (columns 2-3).\n- Larger tiles (256, 128, 64) are spread across the grid, with two 256s in Column 1 (Rows 0 and 3).\n- No immediate merges are possible in any direction, as adjacent tiles are distinct.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all non-zero tiles are already left-aligned, and adjacent tiles are distinct).  \n   - Result: Board remains unchanged except for a new 2\/4 in an empty tile.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (non-zero tiles are already right-aligned, and adjacent tiles are distinct).  \n   - Result: Board remains unchanged except for a new 2\/4 in an empty tile.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift up. Columns 2 and 3 (with empty top tiles) will have non-zero tiles (32, 2 and 16, 4) move up to fill empty spaces. No merges occur (adjacent tiles remain distinct).  \n   - Result: Board rearranges slightly, but no merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down. Columns 2 and 3 (with empty top tiles) have non-zero tiles (32, 2 and 16, 4) already at the bottom, so no movement. Columns 0 and 1 (no empty tiles) remain unchanged. No merges occur.  \n   - Result: Board remains unchanged except for a new 2\/4 in an empty tile.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nSince no immediate merges are possible, the goal is to position tiles for future merges. Larger tiles (e.g., 256s in Column 1) are better kept in a corner or aligned for potential future merges. Swiping DOWN maintains the current alignment of larger tiles (256s in Column 1, 128 in Row 2, Column 0) and keeps empty spaces in the top rows, which can accommodate new tiles without disrupting larger tiles. This alignment supports long-term merging strategies.\n\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify which move maximizes future merging opportunities and aligns with strategic principles (e.g., clustering larger tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 256 | 0 | 128\nRow 1: 4 | 64 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 128 | 16 | 32 | 16\nRow 3: 64 | 256 | 2 | 4\n```\nKey observations:\n- There are 3 empty tiles (zeros) in Row 0 (column 2), Row 1 (columns 2 and 3).\n- No immediate merges are possible in any direction, as no adjacent tiles in rows or columns have the same value.\n- Valid moves are determined by whether tiles can shift into empty spaces. All directions are valid because empty spaces exist to accommodate tile movement.\n\n### Evaluation of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:\n   - Row 0: [32, 256, 0, 128] → Shifts to [32, 256, 128, 0] (128 moves left into the empty space).\n   - Rows 1-3: No movement (tiles are already left-aligned or no empty spaces to shift into).\n   - Outcome: Minimal movement (only Row 0 shifts). No merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:\n   - Row 0: [32, 256, 0, 128] → Shifts to [0, 32, 256, 128] (32 and 256 move right into empty spaces).\n   - Row 1: [4, 64, 0, 0] → Shifts to [0, 0, 4, 64] (4 and 64 move right into empty spaces).\n   - Rows 2-3: No movement (tiles are already right-aligned or no empty spaces to shift into).\n   - Outcome: Moderate movement (Rows 0 and 1 shift). No merges.\n\n3. **UP**:\n   - Column 2: [0, 0, 32, 2] → Shifts to [32, 2, 0, 0] (32 and 2 move up into empty spaces).\n   - Column 3: [128, 0, 16, 4] → Shifts to [128, 16, 4, 0] (16 and 4 move up into empty spaces).\n   - Columns 0-1: No movement (tiles are already top-aligned or no empty spaces to shift into).\n   - Outcome: Significant movement (Columns 2 and 3 shift). No merges.\n\n4. **DOWN**:\n   - Column 3: [128, 0, 16, 4] → Shifts to [0, 128, 16, 4] (128 moves down into the empty space).\n   - Columns 0-2: No movement (tiles are already bottom-aligned or no empty spaces to shift into).\n   - Outcome: Minimal movement (only Column 3 shifts). No merges.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe best move should prioritize creating opportunities for future merges by aligning tiles and maintaining flexibility. Swiping **UP** shifts tiles in Columns 2 and 3, moving smaller tiles (32, 2, 16, 4) upward and leaving empty spaces in the lower rows. This arrangement keeps larger tiles (e.g., 256, 128) in upper rows and positions smaller tiles for potential future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 256 | 32 | 128\nRow 1: 4 | 64 | 2 | 16\nRow 2: 128 | 16 | 4 | 4\nRow 3: 64 | 256 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are distinct (32, 256, 32, 128) → no merging.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles are distinct (4, 64, 2, 16) → no merging.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles 4 and 4 merge into 8 → new row: `128 | 16 | 8 | 0` (score +8).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left (64, 256, 0, 0) → no merging.  \n**Result**: Merges 4+4 in Row 2, but 256 in Row 3 (Column 1) remains in the middle.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are distinct (32, 256, 32, 128) → no merging.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles are distinct (4, 64, 2, 16) → no merging.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles 4 and 4 merge into 8 → new row: `128 | 16 | 0 | 8` (score +8).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right (64, 256, 0, 0) → new row: `0 | 0 | 64 | 256`.  \n**Result**: Merges 4+4 in Row 2, and 256 in Row 3 (Column 3) moves to the bottom-right corner (a strategic corner for large tiles).\n\n### UP Move:\n- All columns have distinct or non-adjacent tiles → no merges or movement. No score.\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- All columns have distinct or non-adjacent tiles → no merges or movement. No score.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe goal is to keep large tiles in corners. Moving RIGHT shifts the 256 in Row 3 to the bottom-right corner (Column 3), which is optimal. LEFT leaves the 256 in Row 3 (Column 1) in the middle. Thus, RIGHT is better for long-term strategy.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities, tile positioning, and strategic goals (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 256 | 32 | 128\nRow 1: 4 | 64 | 2 | 16\nRow 2: 0 | 128 | 16 | 8\nRow 3: 0 | 128 | 64 | 256\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The largest tiles are 256 (at (0,1) and (3,3)).\n- Merging opportunities exist in **Column 1** (128 at (2,1) and 128 at (3,1) are adjacent vertically).\n- Strategic goal: Keep large tiles in corners (e.g., bottom-right corner has a 256; aim to reinforce this corner).\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **LEFT**: No merges occur in any row (all tiles in rows are distinct). Tiles shift left, but no score is gained.  \n- **RIGHT**: No merges occur in any row (all tiles in rows are distinct). Tiles shift right, but no score is gained.  \nBoth directions fail to create merges, making them suboptimal.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 1** (256, 64, 128, 128): The two 128s (at (2,1) and (3,1)) merge into a 256, adding 256 to the score.  \n- Resulting board after merge:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 32 | 256 | 32 | 128  \n  Row 1: 4 | 64 | 2 | 16  \n  Row 2: 0 | 256 | 16 | 8  \n  Row 3: 0 | 0 | 64 | 256  \n  ```  \n- The merged 256 is placed in Row 2, Column 1 (middle of the grid), which is not ideal for corner-based strategies.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 1** (256, 64, 128, 128): The two 128s (at (2,1) and (3,1)) merge into a 256, adding 256 to the score.  \n- Resulting board after merge:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 0 | 0 | 32 | 128  \n  Row 1: 0 | 256 | 2 | 16  \n  Row 2: 32 | 64 | 16 | 8  \n  Row 3: 4 | 256 | 64 | 256  \n  ```  \n- The merged 256 is placed in Row 3, Column 1 (bottom row), aligning with the corner strategy (the existing 256 in Row 3, Column 3 is already in the bottom-right corner). This positions large tiles along the bottom row, facilitating future merges.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move. It merges two 128s into a 256 (scoring 256) and positions the new 256 in the bottom row, supporting the corner strategy for future moves.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities and maintain larger tiles in strategic positions.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 64 | 32 | 128\nRow 1: 0 | 256 | 2 | 16\nRow 2: 32 | 64 | 16 | 8\nRow 3: 4 | 256 | 64 | 256\n```\nKey observations:\n- There are no adjacent tiles with the same number (horizontally or vertically), so valid moves depend on empty spaces (zeros) to shift tiles into.\n- Empty spaces are in Row 0, Column 0 and Row 1, Column 0.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   No tiles can shift right because all non-zero tiles are already as far right as possible. No movement occurs. **Invalid**.\n\n2. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles in columns cannot shift down (no empty spaces below non-zero tiles in columns). No movement occurs. **Invalid**.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Only Column 0 (with zeros in Rows 0 and 1) can shift up. The non-zero tiles (32 in Row 2, Column 0 and 4 in Row 3, Column 0) shift up to Rows 0 and 1, Column 0, leaving zeros in Rows 2 and 3, Column 0. This is a valid move but creates empty spaces on the left, which may not align with larger tiles on the right.\n\n4. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Rows 0 and 1 (with zeros in Column 0) can shift left. In Row 0: `[0, 64, 32, 128]` becomes `[64, 32, 128, 0]` (empty space in Column 3). In Row 1: `[0, 256, 2, 16]` becomes `[256, 2, 16, 0]` (empty space in Column 3). Rows 2 and 3 have no zeros, so they remain unchanged. This move creates empty spaces on the right, adjacent to larger tiles (128 in Row 0, Column 3 and 256 in Row 3, Column 3), which is strategic for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe is optimal because it shifts tiles to the left, creating empty spaces on the right (near larger tiles like 128 and 256). This setup preserves larger tiles in the right half of the grid and allows flexibility for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for possible merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles when swiping left, right, up, or down. The current game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 32 | 128 | 128\nRow 1: 256 | 2 | 16 | 0\nRow 2: 32 | 64 | 16 | 8\nRow 3: 4 | 256 | 64 | 256\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: The two 128s in columns 2 and 3 merge into 256, resulting in `64 | 32 | 256 | 0` (score +256).  \n   - Other rows: No merges (tiles shift left but no adjacent equal numbers).  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: The two 128s in columns 2 and 3 merge into 256, shifting right to `64 | 32 | 0 | 256` (score +256).  \n   - Other rows: No merges (tiles shift right but no adjacent equal numbers).  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 2: The two 16s in rows 1 and 2 merge into 32, resulting in `128 | 32 | 64 | 0` (score +32).  \n   - Other columns: No merges (tiles shift up but no adjacent equal numbers).  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 2: The two 16s in rows 1 and 2 merge into 32, resulting in `128 | 0 | 32 | 64` (score +32).  \n   - Other columns: No merges (tiles shift down but no adjacent equal numbers).  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield a 256 merge (highest score gain), while UP and DOWN only yield 32. Between LEFT and RIGHT:  \n- Swiping RIGHT places the merged 256 in row 0, column 3 (top-right corner), adjacent to the existing 256 in row 3, column 3 (bottom-right corner). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners and potentially setting up future merges in the same column.  \n- Swiping LEFT places the merged 256 in row 0, column 2, which is not in a corner and less strategically advantageous.  \n\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: [2, 64, 32, 256]\nRow 1: [0, 256, 2, 16]\nRow 2: [32, 64, 16, 8]\nRow 3: [4, 256, 64, 256]\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Larger Tiles**: The largest tiles are 256, located at (0,3), (1,1), (3,1), and (3,3). Strategic play involves consolidating larger tiles in a corner (e.g., (3,3)) to avoid disruption.\n- **Empty Tile**: Only one empty tile exists at (1,0). Valid moves require either merging adjacent tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces.\n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### 1. LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: All tiles are non-zero and distinct; no movement or merging.\n- **Row 1**: The empty tile (1,0) shifts tiles left, resulting in `[256, 2, 16, 0]` (new empty tile at (1,3)).\n- **Row 2**: All tiles are non-zero and distinct; no movement.\n- **Row 3**: Tiles are non-zero and distinct; no movement or merging.\n- **Outcome**: No merges. New empty tile at (1,3), which is near the 256 at (0,3), risking disruption of larger tiles.\n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: All tiles are non-zero and distinct; no movement.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles cannot shift right into the empty tile (1,0) (since rightward movement leaves (1,0) unchanged).\n- **Row 2**: All tiles are non-zero and distinct; no movement.\n- **Row 3**: Tiles are non-zero and distinct; no movement or merging.\n- **Outcome**: No valid movement. RIGHT is not a valid move.\n\n#### 3. UP:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift up, resulting in `[2, 32, 4, 0]` (new empty tile at (3,0)).\n- **Other Columns**: No merging or significant movement (tiles are distinct or non-adjacent).\n- **Outcome**: No merges. New empty tile at (3,0), adjacent to the 256 at (3,1), potentially disrupting larger tiles.\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift down, resulting in `[0, 2, 32, 4]` (new empty tile at (0,0)).\n- **Other Columns**: No merging or significant movement (tiles are distinct or non-adjacent).\n- **Outcome**: No merges. New empty tile at (0,0), a corner opposite the largest tile (256 at (3,3)), minimizing disruption to larger tiles.\n\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nDOWN is preferred because it places the new empty tile in the corner (0,0), away from the critical 256 tiles clustered in the (3,3) corner. This reduces the risk of disrupting larger tiles in future moves, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles consolidated in a corner.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules, focusing on merging tiles to maximize the score.

No adjacent tiles in any row are identical, so no merges occur. Tiles remain in their current positions.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row is processed right-to-left. No adjacent tiles in any row are identical, so no merges occur. Tiles remain in their current positions.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Each column is processed top-to-bottom. No adjacent tiles in any column are identical, so no merges occur. Tiles remain in their current positions.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Each column is processed bottom-to-top.

Tiles in each row are non-adjacent and distinct (e.g., Row 1: [2, 256, 2, 16] has 2s separated by 256, preventing merging). No merges or tile movement occur.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Similar to LEFT, all rows are full. Tiles in each row remain in place as no adjacent duplicates exist (e.g., Row 3: [4, 256, 64, 256] has 256s separated by 64, no merging). No merges or tile movement occur.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - All columns are full (no zeros). Columns contain distinct values (e.g., Column 1: [64, 256, 64, 256] has 64s and 256s separated by other values, no merging). No merges or tile movement occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - All columns are full. Columns have no adjacent duplicates (e.g., Column 3: [256, 16, 8, 256] has 256s separated by 16 and 8, no merging). No merges or tile movement occur.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent tiles have the same value. Thus, no valid moves exist to merge tiles or shift tiles into empty spaces. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we choose **DOWN** as a default option.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to check for potential tile merges or valid shifts that could set up future merges.

A valid move requires either adjacent tiles of the same number (which can merge) or empty spaces (to shift tiles into). The current grid has no empty spaces (all 16 tiles are filled), so valid moves depend solely on merging adjacent tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 64 | 32 | 256  \nRow 1: 2 | 256 | 2 | 16  \nRow 2: 32 | 64 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 4 | 256 | 64 | 256  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows are full with no adjacent duplicates.

Column 1 has 64s and 256s alternating, and Column 3 has 256s separated by 16 and 8.

Given strategic considerations (e.g., aligning larger tiles), **UP** is selected as a default.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or shifts in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same value.  \n\n### Current Grid:  \nRow 0: 16 | 64 | 32 | 256  \nRow 1: 2 | 256 | 2 | 16  \nRow 2: 32 | 64 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 4 | 256 | 64 | 256  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:  \n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows are fully occupied with no adjacent equal tiles.

The grid is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 64 | 32 | 256  \nRow 1: 2 | 256 | 2 | 16  \nRow 2: 32 | 64 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 4 | 256 | 64 | 256  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid is Full**: All 16 tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces, `0`).  \n2. **No Adjacent Merges**: There are no adjacent tiles with the same value (horizontally or vertically). For example:\n   - Row 1 has `2` at (1,0) and (1,2), but they are separated by `256` (non-adjacent).  \n   - Row 3 has `256` at (3,1) and (3,3), but they are separated by `64` (non-adjacent).  \n   - Column 1 has `64` at (0,1) and (2,1), separated by `256` (non-adjacent).  \n   - Column 1 also has `256` at (1,1) and (3,1), separated by `64` (non-adjacent).  \n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, swiping in any direction will not result in tile movement or merges. All tiles remain in their current positions, and no new tiles can be added (no empty spaces).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent merges, meaning there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, the answer defaults to one of the options, with no strategic advantage.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of merging tiles and shifting. The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 16|64|32|256  \nRow 1: 2|256|2|16  \nRow 2: 32|64|16|8  \nRow 3: 4|256|64|256  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles (0s):** The grid is fully occupied, so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same value.  \n- **Adjacent tile check:** No two adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. For example:  \n  - Row 1 has 2s at (1,0) and (1,2), but they are separated by 256.  \n  - Row 3 has 256s at (3,1) and (3,3), separated by 64.  \n  - Column 1 has 64s at (0,1) and (2,1), separated by 256, and 256s at (1,1) and (3,1), separated by 64.  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe:** Tiles shift left. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in any row are equal.  \n2. **RIGHT Swipe:** Tiles shift right. No merges occur for the same reason as LEFT.  \n3. **UP Swipe:** Tiles shift up. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in any column are equal.  \n4. **DOWN Swipe:** Tiles shift down. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in any column are equal.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid merges, any direction is technically invalid, but the most neutral choice (common in such scenarios) is selected.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning.

Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend on adjacent equal tiles.  \n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. For example:  \n     - Row 1: [2, 256, 2, 16] → 2s are separated by 256 and cannot merge.  \n     - Row 3: [4, 256, 64, 256] → 256s are separated by 64 and cannot merge.  \n   - No merges occur.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. For example:  \n     - Row 1: [2, 256, 2, 16] → 2s remain separated by 256.  \n     - Row 3: [4, 256, 64, 256] → 256s remain separated by 64.  \n   - No merges occur.  \n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   - Tiles shift up, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. For example:  \n     - Column 1: [64, 256, 64, 256] → 64s and 256s are separated by other tiles.  \n     - Column 3: [256, 16, 8, 256] → 256s are separated by 16 and 8.  \n   - No merges occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   - Tiles shift down, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. For example:  \n     - Column 1: [64, 256, 64, 256] → 64s and 256s remain separated.  \n     - Column 3: [256, 16, 8, 256] → 256s remain separated.  \n   - No merges occur.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent equal tiles exist, meaning no valid merges are possible. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, an arbitrary choice is made.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the validity of each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or shifting tiles into empty spaces.

No row contains adjacent duplicates (e.g., Row 1: [2, 256, 2, 16] has 2s separated by 256, preventing merging). No merges occur.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe:**  \n   Each row is processed rightward. Similarly, no row contains adjacent duplicates (e.g., Row 3: [4, 256, 64, 256] has 256s separated by 64, preventing merging). No merges occur.\n\n3. **UP Swipe:**  \n   Each column is processed upward. Column 1 ([64, 256, 64, 256]) has 64s and 256s separated by other values (no adjacent duplicates). Column 3 ([256, 16, 8, 256]) has 256s separated by 16 and 8. No merges occur.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe:**  \n   Each column is processed downward.

The two 2s (positions 0 and 2) are not adjacent but could shift left. When swiping left, the 2 at position 2 moves toward the left, and the 2 at position 0 stays. After shifting, the row becomes [2, 2, 256, 16], allowing the two 2s to merge into 4 (score +4).  \n   - Row 2: Tiles (32, 64, 16, 8) are distinct; no merges.  \n   - Row 3: Tiles (4, 256, 64, 256) are distinct; no merges.  \n\n   **Result**: Row 1 merges 2s into 4, yielding a score of 4.  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows have distinct tiles with no adjacent duplicates. Swiping right would not cause any merges, as tiles cannot shift into empty spaces (grid is full).  \n\n   **Result**: No merges or shifts; score 0.  \n\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are checked for vertical merges.

Tiles shift down: `64` (row 0) and `64` (row 2) align at the bottom, and `256` (row 1) and `256` (row 3) align at the bottom.  \n2. Merges: `64 + 64 = 128` (score +128) and `256 + 256 = 512` (score +512).  \n3. Final column 1 after merging and shifting: `0, 0, 128, 512`.  \n\nOther columns (0, 2, 3) have no merges. Total score from DOWN: `128 + 512 = 640`.  \n\n\n### Decision:\nBoth UP and DOWN yield the same score of 640. However, UP consolidates larger tiles (128 and 512) in the upper half of Column 1, which aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (upper-left quadrant) to facilitate future merges. Thus, UP is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. The grid is full (no zeros), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same number. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16 | 64 | 32 | 256  \nRow 1: 2 | 256 | 2 | 16  \nRow 2: 32 | 64 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 4 | 256 | 64 | 256  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: All tiles (16, 64, 32, 256) are distinct and cannot merge. No change.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles (2, 256, 2, 16) are separated by 256, so no merging. No change.  \n   - Row 2: All tiles (32, 64, 16, 8) are distinct. No change.  \n   - Row 3: Tiles (4, 256, 64, 256) are distinct. No change.  \n   **Result**: No merges or shifts. Invalid move.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles (16, 64, 32, 256) are already right-aligned. No change.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles (2, 256, 2, 16) are right-aligned. No change.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles (32, 64, 16, 8) are right-aligned. No change.  \n   - Row 3: Tiles (4, 256, 64, 256) are right-aligned. No change.  \n   **Result**: No merges or shifts. Invalid move.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: Tiles (16, 2, 32, 4) are distinct. No change.  \n   - Column 1: Tiles (64, 256, 64, 256) are separated by 256\/64, so no merging. No change.  \n   - Column 2: Tiles (32, 2, 16, 64) are distinct. No change.  \n   - Column 3: Tiles (256, 16, 8, 256) are separated by 16\/8, so no merging. No change.  \n   **Result**: No merges or shifts. Invalid move.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: Tiles (16, 2, 32, 4) are distinct. No change.  \n   - Column 1: Tiles (64, 256, 64, 256) are separated by 256\/64, so no merging. No change.  \n   - Column 2: Tiles (32, 2, 16, 64) are distinct. No change.  \n   - Column 3: Tiles (256, 16, 8, 256) are separated by 16\/8, so no merging. No change.  \n   **Result**: No merges or shifts. Invalid move.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent tiles of the same number, meaning no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and all are invalid, the answer defaults to any direction (as no valid moves are possible).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move for the given 4x4 grid at epoch 100, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to check for valid moves and potential merges. A valid move requires either adjacent tiles of the same number (which can merge) or empty spaces (which allow tiles to shift). The grid is currently full (no zeros), so valid moves depend solely on adjacent tiles with the same number.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 64 | 32 | 256  \nRow 1: 2 | 256 | 2 | 16  \nRow 2: 32 | 64 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 4 | 256 | 64 | 256  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows are full (no zeros).

However, since the problem requires selecting one of the directions, any direction is technically acceptable (though all are invalid). \n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: LEFT'\nRules:The game is played on a 4x4 grid, with each tile containing a number that is a power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048). Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n16|64|32|256\n2|256|2|16\n32|64|16|8\n4|256|64|256\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

A valid move must either merge these `2`s or shift tiles into empty spaces.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Swiping left shifts all tiles in Row 1 to the left. The `2`s in (1,0) and (1,3) will move to (1,0) and (1,1) (since empty spaces are filled). These adjacent `2`s merge into a `4`, increasing the score by 4. The resulting Row 1 becomes `4|0|0|0`. A new tile (2 or 4) will spawn in an empty space. This is a valid move with merging.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Swiping right shifts all tiles in Row 1 to the right. The `2`s in (1,0) and (1,3) will move to (1,2) and (1,3) (since empty spaces are filled). These adjacent `2`s merge into a `4`, increasing the score by 4. The resulting Row 1 becomes `0|0|0|4`. A new tile (2 or 4) will spawn in an empty space. This is also a valid move with merging.\n\n3. **UP\/DOWN**:  \n   Swiping up or down shifts tiles vertically. For UP, the `2`s in Row 1 (Column 0 and Column 3) shift to Row 0 (Column 0 and Column 3), leaving them non-adjacent (no merge). For DOWN, the `2`s shift to Row 3 (Column 0 and Column 3), again non-adjacent (no merge). These moves do not merge tiles and only shift them into empty spaces without scoring.\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nThe goal is to merge tiles to maximize score and strategically position larger tiles. Both LEFT and RIGHT merge the `2`s into a `4`, but LEFT consolidates the new `4` on the left edge, which aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on strategic goals like positioning larger tiles in corners and setting up future merges.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 4|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|2\n```\nTiles are at positions (1,0) (value 4) and (3,3) (value 2). The goal is to shift tiles to maximize future merging potential and keep larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 1 (4) remains in (1,0). Row 3 (2) shifts to (3,0).  \n   - Result: Tiles at (1,0) and (3,0) (column 0, rows 1 and 3). No merges.  \n   - Future potential: New tiles could fill (2,0), creating vertical adjacency but no immediate merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 1 (4) shifts to (1,3). Row 3 (2) remains in (3,3).  \n   - Result: Tiles at (1,3) and (3,3) (column 3, rows 1 and 3). No merges.  \n   - Future potential: New tiles could fill (2,3), creating vertical adjacency but no immediate merges.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0 (4 at row 1) shifts up to (0,0). Column 3 (2 at row 3) shifts up to (0,3).  \n   - Result: Tiles at (0,0) (4) and (0,3) (2) (top row, corners). No merges.  \n   - Future potential: New tiles in the top row (e.g., (0,1) or (0,2)) could create horizontal adjacency, enabling merges with 4 or 2 in subsequent moves. Larger tiles (4) are positioned in a corner, aligning with strategic goals.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0 (4 at row 1) shifts down to (3,0). Column 3 (2 at row 3) remains in (3,3).  \n   - Result: Tiles at (3,0) (4) and (3,3) (2) (bottom row, corners). No merges.  \n   - Future potential: Similar to UP, but the bottom row may be less favorable for early merging compared to the top row.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP positions the larger tile (4) in the top-left corner (0,0) and the smaller tile (2) in the top-right corner (0,3). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners and sets up the top row for potential horizontal merges with new tiles. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|0|2\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|2|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- Row 0: [4,0,0,2] → shifts to [4,2,0,0] (no merge, 4 and 2 are different).  \n- Row 1: All zeros (no change).  \n- Row 2: [0,2,0,0] → shifts to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- Row 3: All zeros (no change).  \nResult: Tiles are spread across rows 0 and 2, with no immediate merge opportunities.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- Row 0: [4,0,0,2] → shifts to [0,0,4,2] (no merge).  \n- Row 1: All zeros (no change).  \n- Row 2: [0,2,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,2] (no merge).  \n- Row 3: All zeros (no change).  \nResult: Tiles are pushed to the right, but no merges occur, and larger tiles (4) are not in a corner.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- Column 0: [4,0,0,0] → remains [4,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- Column 1: [0,0,2,0] → shifts to [0,2,0,0] (2 moves up to row 1, no merge).  \n- Column 3: [2,0,0,0] → remains [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \nResult: Tiles are spread vertically, with no merges, and the 4 stays in the top-left corner but lacks adjacent tiles for future merges.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- Column 0: [4,0,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,4] (4 moves to row 3, bottom-left corner).  \n- Column 1: [0,0,2,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,2] (2 moves to row 3).  \n- Column 3: [2,0,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,2] (2 moves to row 3).  \nResult: The 4 is now in the bottom-left corner (a strategic corner), and the two 2s are in row 3 (columns 1 and 3). This positions the 2s in the same row, creating a future merge opportunity (e.g., swiping LEFT next would shift the 2s to adjacent positions, allowing them to merge into a 4).\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe DOWN swipe optimally positions the largest tile (4) in a corner and groups smaller tiles (2s) in the same row, enabling potential future merges.

The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Shifting tiles right also avoids merging. Tiles shift to the right edge but no equal numbers are adjacent, resulting in no score gain.  \n3. **UP**: Shifting tiles up processes columns vertically. For column 0 (values [8, 0, 2, 2]):  \n   - Non-zero tiles [8, 2, 2] shift up to [8, 2, 2, 0].  \n   - The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in column 0: [8, 4, 0, 0].  \n   Other columns (1-3) have no merges. After moving up, the board becomes:  \n   - Row 0: [8, 2, 0, 0]  \n   - Row 1: [4, 0, 0, 0]  \n   - Rows 2-3: [0, 0, 0, 0]  \n   This keeps the 8 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and creates a 4 in row 1, column 0, which can be merged with future 4s.  \n\n4. **DOWN**: Shifting tiles down processes columns vertically. For column 0 (values [8, 0, 2, 2]):  \n   - Non-zero tiles [8, 2, 2] shift down to [0, 8, 2, 2].  \n   - The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in column 0: [0, 8, 0, 4].  \n   Column 1 (value [2, 0, 0, 0]) shifts down to [0, 0, 0, 2]. After moving down, the board becomes:  \n   - Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 0]  \n   - Row 1: [8, 0, 0, 0]  \n   - Row 3: [4, 2, 0, 0]  \n   This moves the 8 out of the top-left corner, reducing strategic positioning for future merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP merges the two 2s in column 0 (score +4), keeps the 8 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and leaves ample empty space for future tile spawns.

The board remains mostly unchanged (non-zero tiles are already as left as possible). No score is gained.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur. Non-zero tiles move to the right end of their rows, but no combinations happen. No score is gained.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward. For column 1 (values `2` in row 0 and `2` in row 1), the two `2`s merge into a `4` (score +4). The 8 in row 0, column 0 remains in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for larger tiles). The grid after merging (before adding a new tile) becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 8|4|0|0  \n   Row 1: 4|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   This preserves the 8 in a corner and sets up potential future merges (e.g., a new 4 in row 1, column 0 could merge with the existing 4 in row 1, column 0 if swiped up again).  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward. For column 1 (values `2` in row 0 and `2` in row 1), the two `2`s merge into a `4` (score +4). However, the 8 in row 0, column 0 moves to row 3, column 0 (bottom-left corner). While this is also a corner, moving the 8 away from its original top-left position reduces strategic alignment for future merges (e.g., merging 8 with a new 8 in the same corner would be harder).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP is the best move. It merges the two `2`s for a score, keeps the largest tile (8) in a strategic corner, and positions smaller tiles to enable future merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the current game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 4 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 4 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### **LEFT Swipe**  \nTiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). The grid remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain. This is not optimal.  \n\n\n### **RIGHT Swipe**  \nTiles shift right, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). The grid remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain. This is not optimal.  \n\n\n### **UP Swipe**  \nTiles shift upward. Let’s analyze columns:  \n- **Column 0**: [8, 4, 0, 0] → Tiles shift up (no merge, distinct values).  \n- **Column 1**: [4, 0, 0, 4] → Tiles shift up, merging the two 4s into 8 (score +8). The merged 8 occupies Row 0, Column 1, with Row 1, Column 1 becoming empty.  \n- Columns 2 and 3: All zeros, no change.  \n\nAfter the UP swipe, the grid becomes:  \nRow 0: 8 | 8 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\nThis merges two 4s into an 8 (score +8) and positions larger tiles (8s) in the top row, which is strategic for future merges (e.g., merging the two 8s in the top row with a subsequent LEFT swipe).  \n\n\n### **DOWN Swipe**  \nTiles shift downward. Let’s analyze columns:  \n- **Column 0**: [8, 4, 0, 0] → Tiles shift down (no merge, distinct values).  \n- **Column 1**: [4, 0, 0, 4] → Tiles shift down, merging the two 4s into 8 (score +8). The merged 8 occupies Row 3, Column 1, with Row 2, Column 1 becoming empty.  \n- Columns 2 and 3: All zeros, no change.  \n\nAfter the DOWN swipe, the grid becomes:  \nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 4 | 8 | 0 | 0  \n\nWhile this also merges two 4s into an 8, the larger tiles (8s) are scattered in lower rows, making future merges less efficient compared to the UP swipe.  \n\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe UP swipe merges two 4s into an 8 (score +8) and positions larger tiles in the top row, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner for future merges. This is the optimal move.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the current game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|8|0|0  \nRow 1: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|2  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:  \n- **Row 0**: The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in `16|0|0|0`.  \n- **Row 1**: The 4 shifts left to `4|0|0|0`.  \n- **Row 2**: No change (remains `0|0|0|0`).  \n- **Row 3**: The 2 shifts left to `2|0|0|0`.  \n- **Result**: Non-zero tiles cluster in Column 0 (16, 4, 2). A new tile (2 or 4) will fill an empty spot.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n- **Row 0**: The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), shifting right to `0|0|0|16`.  \n- **Row 1**: The 4 shifts right to `0|0|0|4`.  \n- **Row 2**: No change (remains `0|0|0|0`).  \n- **Row 3**: The 2 stays in the rightmost position (`0|0|0|2`).  \n- **Result**: Non-zero tiles cluster in Column 3 (16, 4, 2). A new tile (2 or 4) will fill an empty spot.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:  \n- Tiles shift upward, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in columns).  \n- **Result**: Tiles stack upward with no score gain.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:  \n- Tiles shift downward, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in columns).  \n- **Result**: Tiles stack downward with no score gain.  \n\n\n### Key Consideration:  \nLEFT and RIGHT swipes both merge the 8s into 16 (scoring 16). However, RIGHT is preferable because it clusters larger tiles (16, 4, 2) in the right column (Column 3), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner. This setup facilitates future vertical merges (e.g., if a new tile is added in Column 3, Row 2, it could merge with the 2 in Row 3).  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to position tiles for future merges and keep larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 2: 0|4|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|2  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Tiles shift to the left in each row.  \n  - Row 0: [0,0,0,16] → [16,0,0,0] (16 moves to column 0).  \n  - Row 1: [0,0,0,4] → [4,0,0,0] (4 moves to column 0).  \n  - Row 2: [0,4,0,0] → [4,0,0,0] (4 moves to column 0).  \n  - Row 3: [0,0,0,2] → [2,0,0,0] (2 moves to column 0).  \n- No merges occur. The 16 (largest tile) moves from the top-right corner to the top-left, disrupting the corner strategy.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Tiles shift to the right in each row.  \n  - Row 0: [0,0,0,16] → [0,0,0,16] (16 remains in the top-right corner).  \n  - Row 1: [0,0,0,4] → [0,0,0,4] (4 remains in column 3).  \n  - Row 2: [0,4,0,0] → [0,0,0,4] (4 moves to column 3).  \n  - Row 3: [0,0,0,2] → [0,0,0,2] (2 remains in column 3).  \n- No merges occur immediately, but the two 4s in column 3 (rows 1 and 2) become vertically adjacent. This sets up a potential merge in the next move (e.g., swiping UP to combine them into 8).  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- Tiles shift upward in each column.  \n  - Column 0: All zeros → no change.  \n  - Column 1: [0,0,4,0] → [4,0,0,0] (4 moves to row 0).  \n  - Column 2: All zeros → no change.  \n  - Column 3: [16,4,0,2] → [16,4,2,0] (tiles shift up, no merges).  \n- The 16 remains in the top-right corner, but no meaningful merges or setups for future merges occur.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles shift downward in each column.  \n  - Column 0: All zeros → no change.  \n  - Column 1: [0,0,4,0] → [0,0,0,4] (4 moves to row 3).  \n  - Column 2: All zeros → no change.  \n  - Column 3: [16,4,0,2] → [0,16,4,2] (16 moves down to row 1, disrupting the top-right corner).  \n- No merges occur, and the 16 is moved away from the corner, reducing strategic positioning.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping RIGHT keeps the largest tile (16) in the top-right corner and positions two 4s vertically adjacent in column 3. This setup allows for a potential merge in the next move (e.g., swiping UP to combine the 4s into 8), making RIGHT the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic placement of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 1: 0|2|0|4  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|2  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row). No score gain. The 16 remains in row 0, column 0, but other tiles are scattered left with empty spaces.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row). No score gain. The 16 stays in row 0, column 3, but other tiles are scattered right with empty spaces.  \n3. **UP**: Tiles shift upward, merging adjacent equal tiles in columns.  \n   - Column 3 (16, 4, 4, 2): The two 4s (row 1 and row 2) merge into 8 (score +8). The 16 remains in row 0, column 3 (top-right corner), and the 2 shifts to row 2, column 3.  \n   - Column 1 (0, 2, 0, 0): The 2 shifts to row 0, column 1.  \n   - Result: 16 stays in the corner, and merging 4s into 8 is beneficial.  \n4. **DOWN**: Tiles shift downward, merging adjacent equal tiles in columns.  \n   - Column 3 (16, 4, 4, 2): The two 4s (row 1 and row 2) merge into 8 (score +8). However, the 16 shifts to row 1, column 3 (no longer in the top-right corner).  \n   - Column 1 (0, 2, 0, 0): The 2 shifts to row 3, column 1.  \n   - Result: Merging 4s into 8, but 16 is no longer in the corner, which is suboptimal.  \n\n### Strategic Choice:\nUP is better because it keeps the 16 in the top-right corner (a strategic corner for larger tiles) while merging the 4s into 8, gaining score. DOWN merges the 4s but moves 16 out of the corner, which is less favorable. LEFT and RIGHT do not merge any tiles, so they are not optimal.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to keep larger tiles in a corner (here, the 16 in the top-right corner) and set up future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|2|0|16  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 3: 2|0|0|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift left. Row 0 becomes `2|16|0|0` (16 moves from column 3 to column 1, leaving the corner). Rows 1–3 become `8|0|0|0`, `2|0|0|0`, and `2|0|0|0` (no merges).  \n   - **Issue**: The 16 (largest tile) is moved away from the top-right corner, which is suboptimal.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right. Row 0 becomes `0|0|2|16` (16 stays in the top-right corner). Row 3 becomes `0|0|0|2` (2 moves to column 3). Other rows remain mostly unchanged (no merges).  \n   - **Observation**: The 16 stays in the corner, but no immediate merges are set up.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift up. Column 0 (originally `0,0,0,2`) becomes `2|0|0|0` (2 from row 3 moves to row 0). Column 1 (originally `2,0,0,0`) remains `2|0|0|0` (2 stays in row 0). Column 3 (originally `16,8,2,0`) remains `16|8|2|0` (16 stays in the top-right corner).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 2|2|0|16  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|8  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|2  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - **Key Insight**: Row 0 now has two adjacent 2s (columns 0 and 1). Swiping left next would merge these into a 4, creating a score and keeping the 16 in the corner. This sets up a strategic merge sequence.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift down. Column 1 (originally `2,0,0,0`) becomes `0|0|0|2` (2 moves to row 3). Column 3 (originally `16,8,2,0`) becomes `0|16|8|2` (16 moves to row 1, leaving the top-right corner).  \n   - **Issue**: The 16 is moved away from the corner, which is unfavorable.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe keeps the largest tile (16) in the top-right corner and positions two 2s in row 0 (columns 0 and 1), setting up a future merge (e.g., swiping left next to merge the 2s). This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner and merging smaller tiles strategically.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 2|2|0|16  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 3: 2|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [2,2,0,16] → 2s merge into 4, resulting in [4,16,0,0].  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,8] → 8 shifts left to [8,0,0,0].  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,2] → 2 shifts left to [2,0,0,0].  \n- **Row 3**: [2,0,0,0] → No change (already leftmost).  \n- **Result**: 16 (the largest tile) moves from column 3 to column 1, losing the corner position. This is suboptimal for maintaining large tiles in corners.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [2,2,0,16] → 2s merge into 4, shifting right to [0,0,4,16].  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,8] → 8 stays rightmost at [0,0,0,8].  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,2] → 2 stays rightmost at [0,0,0,2].  \n- **Row 3**: [2,0,0,0] → 2 shifts right to [0,0,0,2].  \n- **Result**: The largest tile (16) remains in the top-right corner (row 0, column 3). The right column now has 16 (row 0), 8 (row 1), 2 (row 2), and 2 (row 3). This stacks smaller tiles below larger ones in the corner, enabling future merges (e.g., the 2s in row 2 and 3 could merge with an UP swipe).  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [2,0,0,2] → 2s merge into 4, shifting up to [4,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 1**: [2,0,0,0] → 2 shifts up to [2,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 3**: [16,8,2,0] → No merges, remains [16,8,2,0].  \n- **Result**: The largest tile (16) stays in the top-right corner, but the 2s in column 3 (row 2 and 3) are not adjacent, limiting future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [2,0,0,2] → 2s merge into 4, shifting down to [0,0,0,4].  \n- **Column 3**: [16,8,2,0] → Tiles shift down to [0,16,8,2].  \n- **Result**: The largest tile (16) moves from row 0 to row 1, losing the corner position. This disrupts the corner strategy.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping **RIGHT** keeps the largest tile (16) in the top-right corner, stacks smaller tiles below it in the right column, and sets up potential future merges (e.g., the 2s in row 2 and 3 of column 3). This aligns with the strategy of maintaining large tiles in corners and enabling strategic merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the game board and strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and maximizing merges.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|4|16  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 2: 8|0|0|2  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|2  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct).  \n- Result: Tiles cluster left, but no score gained.

Key observations:  \n  - Column 2 (original: [4, 0, 0, 8]) shifts up, moving 4 to row 0 and 8 to row 1.  \n  - Column 3 (original: [16, 8, 4, 0]) remains unchanged (no merges).  \n  - After shifting, **Row 1 becomes [0, 0, 8, 8]** (two adjacent 8s).  \n- Result: No score from this move, but creates an opportunity to merge the two 8s in Row 1 with a subsequent LEFT swipe (yielding 16 points).  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed downward. No merges occur (all non-zero tiles are distinct).  \n- Result: No score, and tiles are spread out with no immediate merging opportunities.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe UP direction is optimal because it creates adjacent 8s in Row 1, setting up a merge opportunity in the next move.

No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:  \nTiles shift right in each row. Again, no adjacent tiles in any row are equal, so no merges occur. The board remains unchanged, with no score gain.  \n\n#### **UP Swipe**:  \nTiles shift upward in each column, merging where possible. Key observations:  \n- **Column 3**: Contains `16` (Row 0) and `16` (Row 1). These merge into `32` (Row 0), adding 32 to the score.  \n- Other columns: Tiles shift upward but do not merge (e.g., Column 0: `2` shifts to Row 0; Column 1: `8` stays in Row 0; Column 2: `4` and `8` shift to Rows 0 and 1, respectively).  \n\nResulting board after UP swipe:  \n```\nRow 0: 2|8|4|32  \nRow 1: 0|0|8|4  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n```  \nScore gain: 32. Larger tile `32` is positioned in the top-right corner (strategic for future merges).  \n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:  \nTiles shift downward in each column. Key observations:  \n- **Column 3**: Contains `16` (Row 0), `16` (Row 1), and `4` (Row 2). The `16`s shift downward but do not merge (processed bottom-to-top, no adjacent duplicates).  \n- Other columns: Tiles shift downward but do not merge (e.g., Column 0: `2` shifts to Row 3; Column 1: `8` shifts to Row 3; Column 2: `4` and `8` shift to Rows 2 and 3, respectively).  \n\nResulting board after DOWN swipe:  \n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|4|0  \nRow 3: 2|8|8|4  \n```  \nNo merges occur (horizontal adjacency in Row 3 does not count for a DOWN swipe). Score gain: 0.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe UP swipe results in a merge of two `16`s into `32`, adding 32 to the score and strategically placing the larger tile in the top-right corner. This is the best move.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on strategic goals like consolidating tiles, setting up future merges, and keeping larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board (rows 0-3):\n- Row 0: 2 | 8 | 4 | 32  \n- Row 1: 0 | 0 | 8 | 4  \n- Row 2: 0 | 4 | 0 | 0  \n- Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\nThe largest tile is 32, positioned in the top-right corner (row 0, column 3). A key strategy is to keep large tiles in corners to maximize future merging potential.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: No change (no zeros to shift).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,8,4] → shifts to [8,4,0,0].  \n   - Row 2: [0,4,0,0] → shifts to [4,0,0,0].  \n   - Row 3: No change.  \n   - Result: Tiles shift left but no merges occur. The 32 remains in the top-right, but no obvious future merges are set up.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: No change (no zeros to shift).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,8,4] → no change (already right-aligned).  \n   - Row 2: [0,4,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,4] (4 moves to column 3).  \n   - Row 3: No change.  \n   - Result: The 32 stays in the top-right. Notably, column 3 now has [32, 4, 4, 0] (row 0:32, row 1:4, row 2:4, row 3:0). This positions two 4s vertically adjacent in column 3, setting up a potential merge (e.g., a future UP move would merge the 4s into 8, scoring 8).  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns shift upward, but no merges occur.  \n   - Row 0: [2,8,4,32] (no change).  \n   - Row 1: [0,4,8,4] (4 from row 2, column 1 shifts up).  \n   - Rows 2-3: Remain mostly empty.  \n   - Result: The 32 stays in the top-right, but no clear future merges are set up compared to RIGHT.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns shift downward, moving the 32 from row 0, column 3 to row 2, column 3 (no longer a corner).  \n   - This weakens the position of the largest tile, making future merges harder.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT keeps the 32 in the top-right corner and strategically positions two 4s vertically in column 3, enabling a potential merge in the next move (e.g., UP). This setup aligns with the goal of consolidating tiles for higher scores.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to maximize merges and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 8 | 4 | 32\nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 8 | 4\nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 4\nRow 3: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all non-zero tiles in each row are distinct). The board remains mostly unchanged. No score gain.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (non-zero tiles are not adjacent). The board remains mostly unchanged. No score gain.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Columns are processed upward. In Column 3 (values `32, 4, 4, 0`), the two `4`s merge into `8` (score +8). The resulting board has limited merge potential (e.g., row 1: `8 | 0 | 8 | 8`), but no significant clustering of mergeable tiles.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Columns are processed downward. Key observations:  \n   - Column 0 (`2, 0, 0, 8`) shifts to `0, 0, 2, 8`.  \n   - Column 1 (`8, 0, 0, 0`) shifts to `0, 0, 0, 8`.  \n   - Column 2 (`4, 8, 0, 0`) shifts to `0, 0, 4, 8`.  \n   - Column 3 (`32, 4, 4, 0`) shifts to `0, 32, 0, 8` (the two `4`s merge into `8` in the bottom row, score +8).  \n\n   After merging, **Row 3 becomes `8 | 8 | 8 | 8`** (all four tiles are `8`). This creates a strong merge opportunity: swiping left or right next would merge adjacent `8`s into `16`s, yielding significant score gains. This clustering of equal tiles is strategically optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move, as it creates a row of four `8`s, enabling future merges and maximizing score potential.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score and position larger tiles strategically (preferably in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|2|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 2|0|4|32\nRow 3: 8|8|8|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: `[0,2,0,0]` shifts to `[2,0,0,0]` (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: `[0,0,0,0]` remains unchanged.\n- **Row 2**: `[2,0,4,32]` shifts to `[2,4,32,0]` (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: `[8,8,8,8]` merges into `[16,16,0,0]` (two 8s merge into 16 twice, scoring 16 + 16 = 32).  \n  **Result**: 32 points, but 32 (row 2, column 2) is not in a corner.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: `[0,2,0,0]` shifts to `[0,0,0,2]` (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: `[0,0,0,0]` remains unchanged.\n- **Row 2**: `[2,0,4,32]` shifts to `[0,2,4,32]` (no merges; 32 stays in column 3, a corner).\n- **Row 3**: `[8,8,8,8]` merges into `[0,0,16,16]` (two 8s merge into 16 twice, scoring 16 + 16 = 32).  \n  **Result**: 32 points, with 32 (row 2, column 3) in the corner, and 16s (row 3, columns 2-3) adjacent to 32, enabling future merges (e.g., 16+16=32, then 32+32=64).\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns shift upward, but no merges occur (all tiles are distinct or separated).  \n  **Result**: 0 points, with 32 (row 0, column 3) in the top-right corner but 8s (row 1) spread out, limiting future merges.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Tiles are already as far down as possible; no movement or merges occur.  \n  **Result**: Invalid move (no tiles shift or merge).\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT is optimal. It retains 32 in the corner (row 2, column 3) and positions 16s (row 3, columns 2-3) adjacent to 32, enabling strategic future merges. LEFT also scores 32 but misplaces 32, while UP and DOWN are less effective.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) by simulating tile movements and merges, considering strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|2\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 8|2|4|32\nRow 3: 0|0|16|16\n```\n\n### Simulating Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: [0,0,0,2] → shifts to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- Row 1: [0,0,0,0] → no change.  \n- Row 2: [8,2,4,32] → no shifts (tiles already left-aligned, no merges).  \n- Row 3: [0,0,16,16] → shifts left, merges 16+16 into 32 → [32,0,0,0] (score +32).  \n\nResulting board after LEFT:  \n```\n2|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n8|2|4|32  \n32|0|0|0  \n```\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: [0,0,0,2] → no change (already right-aligned).  \n- Row 1: [0,0,0,0] → no change.  \n- Row 2: [8,2,4,32] → no shifts (tiles already right-aligned, no merges).  \n- Row 3: [0,0,16,16] → shifts right, merges 16+16 into 32 → [0,0,0,32] (score +32).  \n\nResulting board after RIGHT:  \n```\n0|0|0|2  \n0|0|0|0  \n8|2|4|32  \n0|0|0|32  \n```\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed top-to-bottom.

The two `4`s merge into `8`, resulting in `[16,8,64,0]` (score +8).\n- **Result**: Larger tiles (64 in row 2, column 0; 64 in row 3, column 2) are not in corners.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros (no change).\n- **Row 1**: `[0,0,0,4]` shifts right (no change).\n- **Row 2**: `[64,0,0,8]` shifts right to `[0,0,64,8]` (no merge).\n- **Row 3**: `[16,4,4,64]` shifts right. The two `4`s merge into `8`, resulting in `[0,16,8,64]` (score +8).\n- **Result**: The 64 in row 3, column 3 (bottom-right corner) is strategically placed, which is ideal for building higher tiles.\n\n### UP Move:\n- Tiles shift upward, but no merges occur (no score). Larger tiles (64 in row 0, column 0; 64 in row 2, column 3) are spread out, which is suboptimal.\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- No tiles can move downward, and no adjacent tiles merge. This is an invalid move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT is the best move because it merges the `4`s in row 3 for +8 score and positions the 64 in the bottom-right corner, a strategic location for future merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify a move that aligns tiles for future merges and strategically positions larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|8|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|4\nRow 2: 0|0|64|8\nRow 3: 0|16|8|64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \nWhen swiping left, each row shifts tiles to the left, merging adjacent equal tiles if possible.  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,8,0] → [8,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,4] → [4,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,64,8] → [64,8,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,16,8,64] → [16,8,64,0] (no merge).  \n\nAfter LEFT, the board becomes:  \n```\nRow 0: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 64|8|0|0  \nRow 3: 16|8|64|0  \n```  \nNotably, the 8 in Row 2, Column 1 and the 8 in Row 3, Column 1 are now aligned vertically. This sets up a potential merge if a subsequent DOWN swipe is made, as these 8s can merge into 16.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nSwiping right shifts tiles to the right. Most tiles are already on the right, so no meaningful movement or merges occur.  \n\n#### **UP**  \nSwiping up shifts tiles upward. The 16 in Row 3, Column 1 moves to Row 0, Column 1, but no merges occur. Larger tiles (e.g., 64s) remain scattered, with no clear alignment for future merges.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \nSwiping down shifts tiles downward. No merges occur, and tiles remain loosely distributed without strategic alignment.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe LEFT move aligns the 8s in Column 1 (Row 2 and Row 3), creating a future opportunity to merge them with a DOWN swipe. This strategic positioning is better than other directions, which do not set up such merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board (rows 0-3):\n- Row 0: 8 | 0 | 0 | 32  \n- Row 1: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n- Row 2: 64 | 8 | 0 | 0  \n- Row 3: 16 | 8 | 64 | 0  \n\n### Key Observations:\n- The only adjacent equal tiles are the two `8`s in column 1 (rows 2 and 3). Merging these will yield a `16` and score points.  \n- Other tiles are distinct or separated by empty spaces, so no merges are possible in LEFT\/RIGHT swipes.  \n\n### Direction-Specific Outcomes:\n#### LEFT\/RIGHT Swipes:\n- **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all tiles in rows are distinct).  \n- **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (all tiles in rows are distinct).  \n\n#### UP Swipe:\n- **Column 1** (0, 0, 8, 8): Tiles shift up, merging the two `8`s into a `16` (score +16).  \n- Resulting board (after merge and shifting):  \n  Row 0: 8 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n  Row 1: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 2: 64 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 3: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n- No further merges are immediately possible in the resulting board.  \n\n#### DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 1** (0, 0, 8, 8): Tiles shift down, merging the two `8`s into a `16` (score +16).  \n- Resulting board (after merge and shifting):  \n  Row 0: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 1: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 2: 64 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 3: 16 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n- **Strategic Advantage**: Row 3 now has two adjacent `16`s, which can be merged with a subsequent LEFT swipe (yielding a `32` and further score). This sets up future merges and positions larger tiles (64, 32) in the bottom row, near the corner.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is optimal because it merges the `8`s, creates a pair of `16`s in row 3 (enabling future merges), and positions larger tiles (64, 32) in the bottom row, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game board and strategy of merging tiles and positioning larger tiles advantageously.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|0|0\nRow 1: 4|0|0|0\nRow 2: 64|0|0|2\nRow 3: 16|16|64|32\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: 8 shifts left (no change: 8|0|0|0).  \n   - Row 1: 4 shifts left (no change: 4|0|0|0).  \n   - Row 2: 64 and 2 shift left to 64|2|0|0 (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: 16 and 16 merge into 32, resulting in 32|64|32|0 (score +32).  \n   - Result: Larger tiles (64, 32) are spread across columns, with no clear stacking for future merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: 8 shifts right to 0|0|0|8 (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: 4 shifts right to 0|0|0|4 (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: 64 and 2 shift right to 0|0|64|2 (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: 16 and 16 merge into 32, resulting in 0|32|64|32 (score +32).  \n   - Result: The 64 in Row 2, Column 2 and the 64 in Row 3, Column 2 are vertically adjacent, creating a setup for future merging (e.g., with an UP move). This aligns with the strategy of stacking large tiles for easier merging.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed upward:  \n     - Column 0: 8, 4, 64, 16 (no shifts, no merges).  \n     - Column 1: 16 shifts up to 16|0|0|0 (no merge).  \n     - Column 2: 64 shifts up to 64|0|0|0 (no merge).  \n     - Column 3: 2 and 32 shift up to 2|32|0|0 (no merge).  \n   - Result: No merges occur, and large tiles (64, 32) are spread across rows, reducing strategic positioning.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed downward:  \n     - All columns have tiles already at the bottom (no shifts, no merges).  \n   - Result: No valid movement (tiles cannot shift or merge), making this an invalid move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT is the best move. It merges the 16s in Row 3 for a score of 32 and positions the 64s in Row 2, Column 2 and Row 3, Column 2 vertically adjacent, setting up for future merges. This aligns with the strategy of stacking large tiles to maximize scoring potential.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their effects on the game board. The goal is to maximize score through merges and maintain a strategic tile arrangement.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|8\nRow 1: 0|2|0|4\nRow 2: 0|0|64|2\nRow 3: 0|32|64|32\n```\n\n### LEFT and RIGHT Swipes:\n- **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). Score gain: 0.\n- **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). Score gain: 0.\n\n### UP Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: All zeros; no change.\n- **Column 1**: Tiles [0, 2, 0, 32] shift up to [2, 32, 0, 0] (no merge).\n- **Column 2**: Tiles [0, 0, 64, 64] shift up. The two 64s merge into 128 (score +128), resulting in [128, 0, 0, 0].\n- **Column 3**: Tiles [8, 4, 2, 32] shift up (no merges).  \n*Resulting board after UP*:  \nRow 0: 0|2|128|8  \nRow 1: 0|32|0|4  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|32  \n\n### DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: All zeros; no change.\n- **Column 1**: Tiles [0, 2, 0, 32] shift down to [0, 0, 2, 32] (no merge).\n- **Column 2**: Tiles [0, 0, 64, 64] shift down. The two 64s merge into 128 (score +128), resulting in [0, 0, 0, 128].\n- **Column 3**: Tiles [8, 4, 2, 32] shift down (no merges).  \n*Resulting board after DOWN*:  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 1: 0|2|0|4  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 3: 0|32|128|32  \n\n### Strategic Evaluation:\nBoth UP and DOWN merge the two 64s into 128 (score +128). However, DOWN is preferable because it positions the new 128 tile in the bottom row (row 3, column 2), adjacent to two 32s in row 3 (columns 1 and 3). This structure aligns with the 2048 strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners or edges, making future merges (e.g., 32s) more feasible. UP places the 128 in the top middle, which is less strategic for long-term tile organization.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges and position tiles strategically for future moves.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 8  \nRow 1: 0 | 8 | 0 | 4  \nRow 2: 0 | 2 | 0 | 2  \nRow 3: 0 | 32 | 128 | 32  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: `[0,0,0,8]` → Tiles shift left to `[8,0,0,0]` (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: `[0,8,0,4]` → Tiles shift left to `[8,4,0,0]` (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: `[0,2,0,2]` → Tiles shift left to `[2,2,0,0]`, which merges into `[4,0,0,0]` (score +4).  \n- **Row 3**: `[0,32,128,32]` → Tiles shift left to `[32,128,32,0]` (no merge).  \n\nAfter a LEFT swipe, the board (before adding a new tile) becomes:  \n```\nRow 0: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 8 | 4 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 32 | 128 | 32 | 0  \n```  \nThis setup positions 8s in Row 0 and Row 1 (Column 0), creating potential for merging them in future moves (e.g., swiping UP next). The merge in Row 2 also provides immediate score.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: `[0,0,0,8]` → Tiles shift right (no change: `[0,0,0,8]`).  \n- **Row 1**: `[0,8,0,4]` → Tiles shift right to `[0,0,8,4]` (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: `[0,2,0,2]` → Tiles shift right to `[0,0,2,2]`, which merges into `[0,0,0,4]` (score +4).  \n- **Row 3**: `[0,32,128,32]` → Tiles shift right (no change: `[0,32,128,32]`).  \n\nAfter a RIGHT swipe, the board (before adding a new tile) becomes:  \n```\nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 8  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 8 | 4  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 4  \nRow 3: 0 | 32 | 128 | 32  \n```  \nWhile Row 2 merges, the 8s in Row 0 and Row 1 are not aligned for future merges, making this less strategic than LEFT.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed top to bottom. No tiles merge (all columns have distinct or non-adjacent values). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed bottom to top. No tiles merge (all columns have distinct or non-adjacent values). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the 2s in Row 2 for +4. However, LEFT positions 8s in Column 0 (Row 0 and Row 1), creating opportunities for future merges (e.g., swiping UP next). This strategic alignment makes LEFT the better choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 8|4|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 32|128|32|16  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \nTiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row). Result: No score gain, minimal tile rearrangement.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nTiles shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row). Result: No score gain, minimal tile rearrangement.  \n\n#### **UP**  \nTiles shift upward. In column 0, the two 8s (row 0 and row 1) merge into 16 (score +16). Other columns have no merges.

In column 0, the two 8s (row 0 and row 1) merge into 16 (score +16). In row 2, the 4s (from column 0 and column 1) become adjacent (4|4|0|0), setting up a potential merge next turn.

The 4s in row 2 are primed for merging in the next move.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe DOWN move merges the 8s, retains larger tiles in the bottom row (corner-friendly), and sets up a future merge opportunity for the 4s in row 2. This is the most strategic choice.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN.

LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are already left-aligned (no zeros), so no movement.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `4` and `128` are left-aligned (no zeros to shift into), so no movement.\n- **Row 2**: `32` is already left-aligned, so no movement.\n- **Row 3**: `2` is already left-aligned, so no movement.  \n**Result**: No tiles move or merge. Invalid move.\n\n#### 2. UP:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles `32, 4, 32, 2` are all non-zero and already top-aligned, so no movement.\n- **Column 1**: Tiles `4, 128` are top-aligned (zeros below), so no movement.\n- **Column 2**: `32` is top-aligned, so no movement.\n- **Column 3**: `16` is top-aligned, so no movement.  \n**Result**: No tiles move or merge.

The 128 (highest tile) moves to row 1, column 3 (top-right corner), a strategic position to protect high-value tiles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT positions the highest tile (128) in the top-right corner, a key strategic advantage for future merges. Other moves either leave high tiles in suboptimal positions or fail to move tiles.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and strategic goals (e.g., merging potential, tile placement, and future opportunities).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 4 | 32 | 16\nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 4 | 128\nRow 2: 16 | 0 | 0 | 32\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: [32, 4, 32, 16] (no movement, no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 4, 128] → shifts left to [4, 128, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [16, 0, 0, 32] → shifts left to [16, 32, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 0, 2] → shifts left to [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges. The 128 (largest tile) moves from (1,3) to (1,1), away from the right edge.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: [32, 4, 32, 16] (no movement, no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 4, 128] (no movement, no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [16, 0, 0, 32] → shifts right to [0, 0, 16, 32] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 0, 2] (no movement, no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges. The 128 remains in (1,3), but no meaningful tile grouping occurs.  \n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- **Column 0**: [32, 0, 16, 0] → shifts up to [32, 16, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [4, 0, 0, 0] → shifts up to [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [32, 4, 0, 0] → shifts up to [32, 4, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [16, 128, 32, 2] (no movement, no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges.

This sets up future merges (e.g., a subsequent LEFT swipe could merge these 32s into 64).  \n  - The 128 (largest tile) remains in (1,3), near the right edge, preserving a corner for strategic growth.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe DOWN swipe optimizes future merging potential by clustering 32s in Row 2 while keeping the largest tile (128) in a favorable position. This aligns with the strategy of grouping smaller tiles to build larger ones and maintaining large tiles in corners.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score through merging and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board (rows 0-3):\n- Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 16]\n- Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 128]\n- Row 2: [32, 32, 32, 32]\n- Row 3: [16, 4, 4, 2]\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [0, 0, 0, 16] → Shifts left to [16, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).\n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 0, 128] → Shifts left to [128, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).\n- **Row 2**: [32, 32, 32, 32] → Merges left: (32+32=64, score +64) and (32+32=64, score +64) → [64, 64, 0, 0].\n- **Row 3**: [16, 4, 4, 2] → Merges 4+4=8 (score +8) → [16, 8, 2, 0].\n- **Score Gain**: 64 + 64 + 8 = 136.\n- **Result**: 128 (row 1) moves to the leftmost column, potentially scattering large tiles.\n\n#### 2. RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [0, 0, 0, 16] → Stays [0, 0, 0, 16] (no merge).\n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 0, 128] → Stays [0, 0, 0, 128] (no merge).\n- **Row 2**: [32, 32, 32, 32] → Merges right: (32+32=64, score +64) and (32+32=64, score +64) → [0, 0, 64, 64].\n- **Row 3**: [16, 4, 4, 2] → Merges 4+4=8 (score +8) → [0, 16, 8, 2].\n- **Score Gain**: 64 + 64 + 8 = 136.\n- **Result**: 128 (row 1) remains in the rightmost column (corner), and 64s (row 2) align on the right, adjacent to the 128—strategically better for future merges.\n\n#### 3. UP Swipe:\n- Columns shift up, but no merges occur (tiles are non-adjacent or unequal). Score gain: 0. Poor move.\n\n#### 4. DOWN Swipe:\n- Columns shift down, but no merges occur. Score gain: 0. Poor move.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe 128 tile is currently in the right corner (row 1, column 3). A RIGHT swipe keeps it in this corner, while aligning 64s (row 2, columns 2-3) adjacent to it. This positions larger tiles for future merges (e.g., 64+64=128, then 128+128=256), which is optimal for progression. A LEFT swipe moves the 128 to the left, scattering large tiles.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to maximize merges, set up future high-value combinations, and position larger tiles strategically (e.g., in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 64 | 16  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 128  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 64 | 64  \nRow 3: 0 | 16 | 8 | 2  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left → [64, 16, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left → [128, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left → [128, 0, 0, 0] (merges 64+64 into 128, +128 score).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left → [16, 8, 2, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: Larger tiles (128s) end up in column 0 (leftmost), but no immediate follow-up merges for 128s.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right → [0, 0, 64, 16] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right → [0, 0, 0, 128] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right → [0, 0, 0, 128] (merges 64+64 into 128, +128 score).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right → [0, 16, 8, 2] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: The 128 in Row 1, Column 3 (top-right) and the new 128 in Row 2, Column 3 (middle-right) are vertically adjacent. This positions them to merge into 256 with a subsequent DOWN swipe, a high-value future merge.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- **Column 0**: All zeros → no change.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles shift up → [16, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles shift up → [128, 8, 0, 0] (merges 64+64 into 128, +128 score).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles shift up → [16, 128, 64, 2] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: The merged 128 in Column 2 (middle) is not in a corner, limiting future merge potential.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- **Column 0**: All zeros → no change.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles shift down → [0, 0, 0, 16] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles shift down → [0, 0, 128, 8] (merges 64+64 into 128, +128 score).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles shift down → [16, 128, 64, 2] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: The merged 128 in Column 2 (middle) is not in a corner, reducing strategic positioning.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe RIGHT swipe merges the 64s in Row 2 into 128, and crucially positions two 128s vertically adjacent in Column 3 (top-right and middle-right). This setup allows a future DOWN swipe to merge them into 256 (a high-value tile in the bottom-right corner), which is strategically optimal.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|64|16  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|128  \nRow 2: 0|32|0|128  \nRow 3: 0|16|8|2  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The critical column is **Column 3** (rightmost column), which contains two 128s (Row 1 and Row 2). Merging these 128s would create a 256 tile, providing a significant score gain (256 points).\n- Other columns and rows have no immediate merges, so the focus is on Column 3.\n\n### Direction Evaluation:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   - Swiping LEFT or RIGHT does not merge any tiles, as no adjacent equal tiles exist in rows. These moves only shift tiles but do not create new merges. Score gain = 0.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - Swiping UP processes Column 3 from top to bottom. The non-zero tiles in Column 3 are [16 (Row 0), 128 (Row 1), 128 (Row 2), 2 (Row 3)].  \n   - After shifting up, the 128s (Row 1 and Row 2) merge into 256 (Row 1, Column 3). The 16 (Row 0, Column 3) and 2 (Row 3, Column 3) shift up to Row 0 and Row 2, respectively.  \n   - Resulting board after UP:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|32|64|16  \n     Row 1: 0|16|8|256  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|2  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - Score gain = 256. The 256 tile is positioned in Row 1, Column 3 (closer to the top-right corner, a strategic corner for larger tiles).\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Swiping DOWN processes Column 3 from bottom to top. The non-zero tiles in Column 3 are [16 (Row 0), 128 (Row 1), 128 (Row 2), 2 (Row 3)].  \n   - After shifting down, the 128s (Row 1 and Row 2) merge into 256 (Row 2, Column 3). The 16 (Row 0, Column 3) and 2 (Row 3, Column 3) shift down to Row 1 and Row 3, respectively.  \n   - Resulting board after DOWN:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|16  \n     Row 2: 0|32|64|256  \n     Row 3: 0|16|8|2  \n     ```  \n   - Score gain = 256. The 256 tile is positioned in Row 2, Column 3 (farther from the top-right corner compared to UP).\n\n### Strategic Decision:\nWhile both UP and DOWN merge the 128s into 256, **UP** places the 256 tile closer to the top-right corner (Row 1, Column 3), aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners for future merges. This positions the board more favorably for subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the effect of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|32|64|16\nRow 1: 0|16|8|256\nRow 2: 0|8|0|2\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: `0|32|64|16` → Shifts left to `32|64|16|0` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: `0|16|8|256` → Shifts left to `16|8|256|0` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: `0|8|0|2` → Shifts left to `8|2|0|0` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: Remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n   - Result: No merges, and larger tiles (e.g., 256) remain isolated.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: `0|32|64|16` → Tiles already right-aligned (no movement).  \n   - Row 1: `0|16|8|256` → Tiles already right-aligned (no movement).  \n   - Row 2: `0|8|0|2` → Shifts right to `0|0|8|2` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: Remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n   - Result: Minimal movement, no merges.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed top-to-bottom. All columns have non-zero tiles that do not merge or shift (e.g., Column 1: `32|16|8|0` → no movement; Column 2: `64|8|0|0` → no movement).  \n   - Result: No tiles move or merge. **Invalid move**.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom-to-top, shifting tiles downward:  \n     - Column 1: `32|16|8|0` → Shifts down to `0|32|16|8`.  \n     - Column 2: `64|8|0|0` → Shifts down to `0|0|64|8`.  \n     - Column 3: `16|256|2|0` → Shifts down to `0|16|256|2`.  \n   - New board after shifting:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|32|0|16  \n     Row 2: 0|16|64|256  \n     Row 3: 0|8|8|2  \n     ```  \n   - Key observation: Row 3 has adjacent `8`s (columns 1 and 2), which can merge if swiped left in the next move (scoring 16). Larger tiles (256, 64, 32, 16) are consolidated in lower rows, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping **DOWN** is the best move, as it positions tiles for future merges and consolidates larger tiles in the lower rows.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. The goal is to maximize score, merge tiles strategically, and keep larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|32|0|16\nRow 2: 0|16|64|256\nRow 3: 0|8|8|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [64,0,0,0] → [64,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: [0,32,0,16] → [32,16,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [0,16,64,256] → [16,64,256,0] (no merge; 256 moves from column 3 to column 2, leaving the corner).  \n   - Row 3: [0,8,8,2] → [16,2,0,0] (8s merge into 16, score +16).  \n   **Issue**: The 256 tile (largest) moves out of the bottom-right corner, weakening corner strategy.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [64,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,64] (64 moves to top-right corner).  \n   - Row 1: [0,32,0,16] → [0,0,32,16] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [0,16,64,256] → [0,16,64,256] (256 remains in bottom-right corner).  \n   - Row 3: [0,8,8,2] → [0,0,16,2] (8s merge into 16, score +16).  \n   **Strengths**: 256 stays in the bottom-right corner, and 64 moves to the top-right corner, reinforcing corner strategy.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed upward. No merges occur (all tiles in columns are distinct).  \n   - 256 moves from row 2 to row 1 (column 3), leaving the bottom-right corner.  \n   **Issue**: No score gain, and 256 leaves the corner.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed downward. No merges occur (all tiles in columns are distinct).  \n   - 256 remains in row 2 (column 3), but no score is gained.  \n   **Issue**: No immediate score gain, and fewer strategic merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT is optimal because it merges the 8s in row 3 (gaining 16 points), keeps the largest tile (256) in the bottom-right corner, and moves 64 to the top-right corner, aligning with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|64\nRow 1: 0|16|32|16\nRow 2: 0|16|64|256\nRow 3: 0|0|16|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row). The board remains mostly unchanged, with minimal movement. No score gain. Not ideal.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but all rows are already as right-aligned as possible. No movement or merges occur. Invalid for progress.\n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift down. In column 1 (values `[0,16,16,0]`), the two `16`s merge into `32` (score +32). Other columns have no merges. The resulting board has the merged `32` in row 3, column 1, which is isolated and offers limited future merging potential.\n\n4. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift up. In column 1 (values `[0,16,16,0]`), the two `16`s merge into `32` (score +32). Additionally, row 0 becomes `0|32|32|64` after shifting, creating adjacent `32`s. These `32`s can merge in a subsequent LEFT swipe, enabling future high-value merges. The large tile `256` remains in the bottom-right corner (row 2, column 3), maintaining a strategic corner position.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move because it creates adjacent `32`s in row 0 (enabling future merges) and keeps the large `256` tile in a corner, aligning with optimal strategy.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN based on merging potential, score gain, and strategic tile positioning (keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|32|32|64\nRow 1: 0|0|64|16\nRow 2: 0|0|16|256\nRow 3: 0|128|0|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed upward. All columns have no adjacent equal tiles, and no merges occur. The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain. **Not optimal**.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed downward. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column, so no merges occur.

However, the 256 tile (largest) moves to row 2, column 1 (not a corner), which is suboptimal for future merges.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Each row is processed rightward:\n  - Row 0: [0, 32, 32, 64] → 32 and 32 merge into 64 (score +64), resulting in [0, 0, 64, 64].\n  - Row 1: [0, 0, 64, 16] → shifts to [0, 0, 64, 16] (no merge).\n  - Row 2: [0, 0, 16, 256] → shifts to [0, 0, 16, 256] (no merge).\n  - Row 3: [0, 128, 0, 2] → shifts to [0, 0, 128, 2] (no merge).\n- Score gain: 64. Importantly, the largest tile (256) remains in row 2, column 3 (bottom-right corner), a strategic position for future merges. The 64s in row 0, column 2-3 can be merged in subsequent moves if swiped right again.\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT swipe preserves the 256 tile in the corner (optimal for long-term strategy) and provides the same score gain as LEFT.

Swiping RIGHT preserves 256 in this area and moves the merged 128 (from Row 0) to the top-right corner (Row 0, Column 3), aligning large tiles in the right column.  \n- **Future Merges**: RIGHT maintains 256 in a corner and positions 128 in a complementary corner, setting up potential vertical merges (e.g., 128 in Row 0, Column 3 and 256 in Row 2, Column 3) with future UP\/DOWN moves.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

Wasted move.\n\n4. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - **Column 0**: `[0,0,0,16]` → Shifts up to `[16,0,0,0]` (no merges).  \n   - **Column 1**: `[0,0,0,2]` → Shifts up to `[2,0,0,0]` (no merges).  \n   - **Column 2**: `[0,64,16,128]` → Shifts up to `[64,16,128,0]` (no merges).  \n   - **Column 3**: `[128,16,256,2]` → Shifts up to `[128,16,256,2]` (no merges).  \n   - **Key Outcome**: After shifting, Row 1 becomes `[0,0,16,16]`, aligning two 16s horizontally. This sets up a future merge (e.g., a subsequent LEFT swipe would merge them into 32, earning 32 points). Larger tiles (128, 256) remain in the right column, a strategic corner.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe aligns the 16s in Row 1 for a future merge and keeps larger tiles concentrated in the right column, following the strategy of cornering large tiles.

The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up favorable positions for future merges.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64|64|16|4\nRow 1: 128|256|4|256\nRow 2: 4|64|2|32\nRow 3: 128|0|128|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: `64|64|16|4` → `64` and `64` merge into `128` (score +128). Result: `128|16|4|0`.\n- **Row 1**: `128|256|4|256` → No merges (all distinct). Result: `128|256|4|256`.\n- **Row 2**: `4|64|2|32` → No merges (all distinct). Result: `4|64|2|32`.\n- **Row 3**: `128|0|128|0` → `128` and `128` merge into `256` (score +256). Result: `256|0|0|0`.\n- **Total Score**: 128 + 256 = 384.  \n- **Strategic Note**: Larger tiles (256, 128) cluster in the left column, but future merges depend on aligning these tiles vertically.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: `64|64|16|4` → `64` and `64` merge into `128` (score +128). Result: `0|128|16|4`.\n- **Row 1**: `128|256|4|256` → No merges (all distinct). Result: `128|256|4|256`.\n- **Row 2**: `4|64|2|32` → No merges (all distinct).

Result: `0|0|0|256`.\n- **Total Score**: 128 + 256 = 384.  \n- **Strategic Note**: Larger tiles (256, 128) cluster in the right column. The `256` in Row 1, Column 3 and Row 3, Column 3 are positioned to potentially merge in future right swipes (e.g., if the `4` in Row 1, Column 2 shifts right, allowing the two `256`s to merge).\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- All columns have distinct or non-adjacent tiles. No merges occur. Score: 0.  \n- **Strategic Note**: No immediate benefit; larger tiles remain scattered.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- All columns have distinct or non-adjacent tiles. No merges occur. Score: 0.  \n- **Strategic Note**: No immediate benefit; larger tiles remain scattered.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 384 points, but RIGHT is strategically superior. It positions the `256` in Row 3, Column 3 (a corner) and aligns the `256`s in Row 1, Column 3 for potential future merges. This setup better follows the strategy of clustering large tiles in corners and enabling future high-value merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging opportunities, and strategic positioning of large tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0 | 128 | 16 | 4  \nRow 1: 128 | 256 | 4 | 256  \nRow 2: 4 | 64 | 2 | 32  \nRow 3: 8 | 0 | 0 | 256  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0, 128, 16, 4] → Shifts left to [128, 16, 4, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [128, 256, 4, 256] → No shifts (non-zero tiles already left-aligned; no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [4, 64, 2, 32] → No shifts (non-zero tiles left-aligned; no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [8, 0, 0, 256] → Shifts left to [8, 256, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n\nAfter a LEFT move, the 256 in Row 3, Column 3 shifts to Row 3, Column 1. This aligns it vertically with the 256 in Row 1, Column 1 (same column), setting up a potential merge in future moves (e.g., UP).  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0, 128, 16, 4] → No shifts (non-zero tiles already right-aligned; no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [128, 256, 4, 256] → No shifts (non-zero tiles right-aligned; no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [4, 64, 2, 32] → No shifts (non-zero tiles right-aligned; no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [8, 0, 0, 256] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 8, 256] (no merges).  \n\nNo meaningful shifts or merges; 256s remain scattered.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [0, 128, 4, 8] → Shifts up to [128, 4, 8, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [128, 256, 64, 0] → Shifts up to [128, 256, 64, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [16, 4, 2, 0] → Shifts up to [16, 4, 2, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [4, 256, 32, 256] → Shifts up to [4, 256, 32, 256] (no merges).  \n\nAfter an UP move, two 128s in Row 0 (Columns 0 and 1) become adjacent, setting up a potential LEFT merge in future moves. However, merging 128s (to 256) is less valuable than merging 256s (to 512).  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [0, 128, 4, 8] → Shifts down to [0, 128, 4, 8] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [128, 256, 64, 0] → Shifts down to [0, 128, 256, 64] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [16, 4, 2, 0] → Shifts down to [0, 16, 4, 2] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [4, 256, 32, 256] → Shifts down to [4, 256, 32, 256] (no merges).  \n\nNo meaningful shifts or merges; 256s remain scattered.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT move strategically positions the 256 in Row 3, Column 3 to Row 3, Column 1, aligning it vertically with the 256 in Row 1, Column 1. This setup creates a higher-value merge opportunity (256 → 512) in future moves, making LEFT the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate merges, score gains, and strategic positioning of large tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 16 | 4 | 128\nRow 1: 128 | 256 | 4 | 256\nRow 2: 4 | 64 | 2 | 32\nRow 3: 8 | 256 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- No merges occur in any row.

Result: [0, 0, 8, 2].  \n- **Row 1 after DOWN**: [256, 256, 0, 128] (adjacent 256s, primed for a future LEFT merge into 512).  \n- Total score gain: 256 + 8 = 264.  \n- Large tiles (256s) are positioned in Row 1 (adjacent), creating a high-potential setup for the next move (LEFT to merge 256+256 into 512).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhile UP and DOWN yield the same immediate score, DOWN strategically positions two 256s adjacently in Row 1.

Score gain: `8`.\n  - Row 3: Tiles `0|0|0|256` shift left, resulting in `256|0|0|0` (moves `256` from bottom-right to bottom-left).\n- While merging the `4`s is useful, moving `256` from its current bottom-right corner (a stable position) to the bottom-left disrupts the corner strategy.\n\n#### **RIGHT**:\n- Rows are processed right-to-left. \n  - Row 0: Tiles `4|512|16|512` have no adjacent duplicates, so no merge.\n  - Row 1: Tiles `16|64|8|32` have no adjacent duplicates, so no merge.\n  - Row 2: Tiles `4|4|2|128` merge the two `4`s into `8`, resulting in `0|8|2|128`. Score gain: `8`.\n  - Row 3: Tiles `0|0|0|256` are already right-aligned, so no change (keeps `256` in the bottom-right corner).\n- This move merges the `4`s in Row 2 while preserving `256` in the bottom-right corner, which is optimal for corner strategy. The `128` in Row 2, Column 3 (after merging) aligns vertically with `256` in Row 3, Column 3, setting up potential future merges (e.g., adding another `128` in Row 1, Column 3 to merge into `256`, then merging with the existing `256`).\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT is the best move, as it merges the `4`s in Row 2, preserves `256` in the bottom-right corner, and positions `128` to support future merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

This setup allows for potential future merges of the two 512s in row 0 (currently separated by 16) if the 16 is moved out of the way. Additionally, keeping larger tiles (e.g., 256 in the bottom-right corner) stable and minimizing disruption to their positions aligns with optimal strategy.  \n\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities, tile positioning, and strategic corner retention for larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 8 | 0 | 512  \nRow 1: 4 | 512 | 16 | 32  \nRow 2: 16 | 64 | 8 | 128  \nRow 3: 32 | 8 | 2 | 256  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [0, 8, 0, 512] → Shifts left to [8, 512, 0, 0]. No merges.  \n   - Rows 1-3: All tiles are distinct and non-zero; no shifts or merges.  \n   - Result: 512 in row 0, column 1 (not a corner), which is suboptimal for future merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [0, 8, 0, 512] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 8, 512]. No merges.  \n   - Rows 1-3: All tiles are distinct and non-zero; no shifts or merges.  \n   - Result: 512 remains in row 0, column 3 (top-right corner), and 256 stays in row 3, column 3 (bottom-right corner). This preserves large tiles in corners, a key strategic goal.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns 0-3: Tiles shift upward, but no merges occur (all tiles are distinct).  \n   - Result: No changes to the positions of large tiles (512, 256), but no strategic improvement.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns 0-3: Tiles shift downward, but no merges occur (all tiles are distinct).  \n   - Result: No changes to the positions of large tiles (512, 256), but no strategic improvement.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving RIGHT preserves the 512 tile in the top-right corner and the 256 tile in the bottom-right corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners for future merges. Other moves either displace large tiles from corners (LEFT) or fail to improve positioning (UP, DOWN).  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the validity and strategic impact of swiping left, right, up, or down.

Since no merges are possible, we focus on moves that shift tiles into the empty space.  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles would shift right, but the empty tile (Row 0, Column 0) is on the left. Tiles in all rows are already as far right as possible (no movement into the empty space). **Invalid**.\n\n2. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles would shift down, but the empty tile (Row 0, Column 0) is at the top. Tiles in Column 0 (0, 4, 16, 32) cannot move down (32 is already at the bottom). **Invalid**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles in Column 0 (0, 4, 16, 32) shift up, moving 4 to (Row 0, Column 0), 16 to (Row 1, Column 0), 32 to (Row 2, Column 0), and leaving 0 at (Row 3, Column 0). This is a valid move (tiles shift into the empty space). However, no merges occur, and the empty tile moves to the bottom-left corner.\n\n4. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles in Row 0 (0, 64, 8, 512) shift left, moving 64 to (Row 0, Column 0), 8 to (Row 0, Column 1), 512 to (Row 0, Column 2), and leaving 0 at (Row 0, Column 3). This is a valid move (tiles shift into the empty space). The empty tile moves to the top-right corner, adjacent to the 512 in Row 0, Column 2—strategically placing larger tiles (512) near a corner.  \n\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nBetween the valid moves (LEFT and UP), **LEFT** is preferable. Shifting left moves the empty tile to the top-right corner (Row 0, Column 3), adjacent to the 512 in Row 0, Column 2. This positions larger tiles (512) near a corner, aligning with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in corners for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of tile movement and merging.

For example:\n  - Horizontal: No two adjacent tiles in any row are equal (e.g., Row 0: 64, 8, 512, 16 are all distinct).\n  - Vertical: No two adjacent tiles in any column are equal (e.g., Column 1: 8, 512, 64, 8—8s are separated by 512 and 64, so not adjacent).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT:** Tiles would shift to the left\/right edge, but since there are no empty spaces or adjacent equal tiles, no merging or movement occurs. These are invalid.  \n2. **UP\/DOWN:** Tiles would shift to the top\/bottom edge, but again, no empty spaces or adjacent equal tiles exist to enable merging or movement. These are also invalid.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are invalid because there are no adjacent equal tiles to merge and no empty spaces to shift tiles into.

The current game board is:\n\n```\n64|8|512|16\n4|512|16|32\n16|64|8|128\n32|8|2|256\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **No Adjacent Merges**: All tiles in rows and columns are distinct. Horizontally, no two adjacent tiles in any row are the same. Vertically, no two adjacent tiles in any column are the same. For example:\n   - Rows: All rows (e.g., `64|8|512|16`, `4|512|16|32`) have distinct values.\n   - Columns: All columns (e.g., `64|4|16|32`, `8|512|64|8`) also have distinct values (even the column with two `8`s has them separated by `512` and `64`, preventing a merge).\n\n2. **Grid is Full**: There are no empty tiles (0s). Since there are no adjacent merges and no empty spaces to shift tiles into, **no valid moves** would result in merges or tile shifts. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nSince no merges are possible, the choice defaults to maintaining or improving tile positioning for future moves. The largest tiles (e.g., `512`, `256`, `128`) are spread across the grid, but `256` is already in the bottom-right corner, a strategic position. Swiping in any direction will not change the board state (as all tiles are already packed with no empty spaces), but to align with typical 2048 strategies (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners), a direction that does not disrupt the current arrangement is preferred.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions are equally valid (or invalid) in this scenario, but a neutral choice like `DOWN` is selected to avoid disturbing the bottom-right corner where `256` is positioned.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to identify potential tile merges and score gains. The goal is to maximize score by merging tiles, as merging increases the score by the value of the new tile.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\nRow 0: 64 | 8 | 512 | 16  \nRow 1: 4 | 512 | 16 | 32  \nRow 2: 16 | 64 | 8 | 128  \nRow 3: 32 | 8 | 2 | 256  \n\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- All rows have distinct numbers. No merges occur. Score gain: 0.  \n\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- All rows have distinct numbers. No merges occur. Score gain: 0.  \n\n\n### UP Move:\n- All columns have distinct numbers. No merges occur. Score gain: 0.  \n\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- **Column 1** (values: 8, 512, 64, 8) is analyzed. When shifting down, the top 8 (row 0) moves down past 512 (row 1) and 64 (row 2) to row 3, where it merges with the existing 8 (row 3). This merge creates a 16 tile. Score gain: 16.  \n- Other columns have distinct numbers, so no additional merges.  \n\n\nThe only valid merge occurs with a DOWN move, resulting in a score gain of 16. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile movement. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 64|8|512|16\nRow 1: 4|512|16|32\nRow 2: 16|64|8|128\nRow 3: 32|8|2|256\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid Status**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no zeros), meaning there are no empty spaces to shift tiles into.\n2. **Adjacent Tiles**: No two adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. For example:\n   - Row 0: 64, 8, 512, 16 (all distinct).\n   - Row 1: 4, 512, 16, 32 (all distinct).\n   - Row 2: 16, 64, 8, 128 (all distinct).\n   - Row 3: 32, 8, 2, 256 (all distinct).\n   - Columns (e.g., Column 1: 8, 512, 64, 8) also have no adjacent duplicates.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Since all tiles are already packed to the edges (no empty spaces), shifting left or right will not change the board. No merges occur.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Similarly, vertical shifts (up\/down) will not move tiles because the grid is full, and no adjacent tiles can merge. No merges occur.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWith no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles to merge, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the directions, any direction is technically invalid but must be chosen. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges and valid moves. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 8 | 512 | 16  \nRow 1: 4 | 512 | 16 | 32  \nRow 2: 16 | 64 | 8 | 128  \nRow 3: 32 | 8 | 2 | 256  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles, 0s). A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles in the direction of the swipe.\n- We check for merges in each direction:\n\n#### LEFT\/RIGHT Swipes:\n- **LEFT**: All rows have distinct adjacent tiles (e.g., Row 0: 64, 8, 512, 16). No merges possible.  \n- **RIGHT**: Similarly, all rows have distinct adjacent tiles (e.g., Row 1: 4, 512, 16, 32). No merges possible.  \n\n#### UP Swipe:\n- Columns are checked top-to-bottom. For example, Column 1 (8, 512, 64, 8) has 8s in Row 0 and Row 3, but they are not adjacent (separated by 512 and 64). No merges occur in any column.  \n\n#### DOWN Swipe:\n- Columns are checked bottom-to-top. Column 1 (8, 512, 64, 8) is critical:  \n  - The 8 in Row 0 (top of Column 1) can move down past 512 (Row 1) and 64 (Row 2) (since they are not the same as 8) and merge with the 8 in Row 3 (bottom of Column 1).  \n  - This merge creates a 16 in Row 3, Column 1. The 512 and 64 in Column 1 shift up to fill the space left by the merged 8s.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly the DOWN swipe enables a valid merge (8 + 8 = 16 in Column 1), making it the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\n64|8|512|16\n4|512|16|32\n16|64|8|128\n32|8|2|256\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No horizontal merges**: All tiles in each row are distinct (e.g., row 1: 64, 8, 512, 16; row 2: 4, 512, 16, 32), so LEFT and RIGHT swipes will not merge any tiles.\n- **No vertical merges except in column 2**: Column 2 has tiles [8, 512, 64, 8], where the top (8) and bottom (8) tiles are duplicates. This is the only potential merge.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles in all rows are already at the edges (left or right) and distinct. Swiping LEFT\/RIGHT will not move or merge any tiles. These are **invalid moves**.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   For column 2 ([8, 512, 64, 8]):  \n   - Tiles shift upward. The bottom 8 (row 4) moves up past 64 and 512 to align with the top 8 (row 1).  \n   - The two 8s merge into 16, adding 16 to the score.  \n   - The merged 16 occupies row 1, column 2. The bottom of column 2 (row 4) becomes empty (0).  \n\n   Resulting board (after merge and new tile):  \n   ```\n   64|16|512|16\n   4|512|16|32\n   16|64|8|128\n   32|0|2|256\n   ```  \n   The empty space (row 4, column 2) is in the bottom row, near the 256 in the bottom-right corner, which is strategically useful for future merges.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   For column 2 ([8, 512, 64, 8]):  \n   - Tiles shift downward. The top 8 (row 1) moves down past 512 and 64 to align with the bottom 8 (row 4).  \n   - The two 8s merge into 16, adding 16 to the score.  \n   - The merged 16 occupies row 4, column 2. The top of column 2 (row 1) becomes empty (0).  \n\n   Resulting board (after merge and new tile):  \n   ```\n   64|0|512|16\n   4|512|16|32\n   16|64|8|128\n   32|16|2|256\n   ```  \n   The empty space (row 1, column 2) is in the top row, which is less strategically useful than an empty space in the bottom row.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nUP is better because it leaves an empty space in the bottom row (near the 256 in the bottom-right corner), which supports future merges toward the corner. DOWN leaves an empty space in the top row, which is less advantageous.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules. The grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number to merge. \n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 8 | 512 | 16  \nRow 1: 4 | 512 | 16 | 32  \nRow 2: 16 | 64 | 8 | 128  \nRow 3: 32 | 8 | 2 | 256  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: All rows have distinct values (no adjacent duplicates). Swiping left or right would not merge any tiles, as tiles are already fully packed with no gaps.  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: All columns also have distinct values (no adjacent duplicates). Swiping up or down would not merge any tiles, as columns are fully packed with no gaps.  \n\n### Key Observation:\nThe grid is completely filled (no 0s), and there are no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) with the same number. According to the rules, a valid move requires either adjacent duplicates to merge or empty spaces to shift tiles. Since neither condition is met, no valid moves exist. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and in such cases, any direction is technically a forced move (even if no merges occur).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules.

All rows have distinct numbers (no adjacent equals) and no empty tiles (0s). Shifting left or right would not merge any tiles or change the board, as there are no empty spaces to shift into.  \n\n2. **UP\/DOWN**:  \n   For vertical moves (UP\/DOWN), we check each column for adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces. All columns also have distinct numbers (no adjacent equals) and no empty tiles. Shifting up or down would not merge any tiles or change the board, as there are no empty spaces to shift into.  \n\n### Key Observation:  \nThe grid is completely full (no 0s), and there are no adjacent equal tiles in any direction. According to the rules, a valid move requires either adjacent equal tiles (to merge) or empty spaces (to shift into). Since neither condition is met, all moves are technically invalid.

When swiping down:  \n   - The 8 from Row 1 shifts down past 512 (Row 2) and 64 (Row 3) to Row 3.  \n   - The 8 from Row 4 remains in Row 4.  \n   - These two 8s in Row 3 and Row 4 merge into a single 16, adding 16 to the score.  \n\nThis is the only direction with a valid merge.  \n\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of merging tiles and creating valid moves.

All rows have distinct values (e.g., row 1: 64, 8, 512, 16; row 2: 4, 512, 16, 32). No merges occur. Tiles cannot shift left (already fully left-aligned). **No valid move.**\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Similar to LEFT, all rows have distinct values. Tiles cannot shift right (already fully right-aligned). **No valid move.**\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Each column is checked for adjacent duplicates. All columns have distinct values (e.g., column 1: 64, 4, 16, 32; column 2: 8, 512, 64, 8). No merges occur. Tiles cannot shift up (already fully up-aligned). **No valid move.**\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are checked for adjacent duplicates. Column 2 has values [8, 512, 64, 8]. The 8s in row 1 and row 4 are vertically separated by 512 (row 2) and 64 (row 3). Since the grid is full, these 8s are not adjacent and cannot merge. Other columns also have distinct values. **No valid move.**\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent tiles have the same value. Thus, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the most strategic choice (assuming potential merges in edge cases) is **DOWN**.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

This means no valid moves can merge tiles or shift them into empty spaces. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid merges, any direction is functionally equivalent, but we choose **UP** as a default.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and check each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) for validity. A valid move requires either adjacent tiles of the same number (which can merge) or empty spaces (0s) to shift tiles into. The current board has no empty spaces (all tiles are non-zero), so validity depends on the presence of adjacent equal tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\n64|8|512|16\n4|512|16|32\n16|64|8|128\n32|8|2|256\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: All rows are full with distinct adjacent tiles (no two same numbers are adjacent horizontally).

The grid is currently full (no empty tiles, 0s), so valid moves require merging adjacent equal tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\n64|8|512|16\n4|512|16|32\n16|64|8|128\n32|8|2|256\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: All rows have distinct tiles with no adjacent equal values. Tiles cannot merge, and shifting left has no effect (tiles are already left-aligned). No score gain.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Similarly, all rows have distinct tiles with no adjacent equals. Tiles cannot merge, and shifting right has no effect (tiles are already right-aligned). No score gain.  \n3. **UP**: All columns have distinct tiles with no adjacent equal values.

Tiles cannot merge, and shifting down has no effect (tiles are already bottom-aligned). No score gain.  \n\n### Key Observation:\nThe grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles), and there are no adjacent equal tiles (horizontally or vertically) to merge. According to the rules, a valid move requires either merging adjacent equal tiles or moving into an empty space. Since neither condition is met, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or shifts in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is currently full (no empty tiles), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same value to merge. \n\n### Grid Analysis:\nThe grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 8 | 512 | 16  \nRow 1: 4 | 512 | 16 | 32  \nRow 2: 16 | 64 | 8 | 128  \nRow 3: 32 | 8 | 2 | 256  \n```\n\n### Checking for Merges:\n- **Horizontal (same row, adjacent columns):** No adjacent tiles in any row have the same value.  \n  - Row 0: 64 vs 8 vs 512 vs 16 (all distinct).  \n  - Row 1: 4 vs 512 vs 16 vs 32 (all distinct).  \n  - Row 2: 16 vs 64 vs 8 vs 128 (all distinct).  \n  - Row 3: 32 vs 8 vs 2 vs 256 (all distinct).  \n\n- **Vertical (same column, adjacent rows):** No adjacent tiles in any column have the same value.  \n  - Column 0: 64 vs 4 vs 16 vs 32 (all distinct).  \n  - Column 1: 8 vs 512 vs 64 vs 8 (8s are in rows 0 and 3, not adjacent).  \n  - Column 2: 512 vs 16 vs 8 vs 2 (all distinct).  \n  - Column 3: 16 vs 32 vs 128 vs 256 (all distinct).  \n\n### Move Validity:\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles (horizontal or vertical) have the same value, no merges are possible in any direction. However, the game requires selecting a direction. Given the lack of merges, any direction is technically valid (as the problem requires a choice), but strategic considerations (e.g., preserving larger tiles) are irrelevant here. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for valid moves (adjacent same tiles or empty spaces to shift into). The current board has no empty tiles (all values are non-zero), so valid moves require adjacent same tiles. \n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 8 | 512 | 16  \nRow 1: 4 | 512 | 16 | 32  \nRow 2: 16 | 64 | 8 | 128  \nRow 3: 32 | 8 | 2 | 256  \n```\n\n### Checking Adjacent Tiles:\n- **Horizontal adjacents** (within rows): All tiles in each row are distinct (e.g., Row 0: 64, 8, 512, 16; no duplicates).  \n- **Vertical adjacents** (within columns): All tiles in each column are distinct (e.g., Column 1: 8, 512, 64, 8; 8s are separated by 512 and 64, not adjacent).  \n\n### Valid Moves:\nSince there are no empty tiles and no adjacent same tiles, no direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) will result in merging or shifting tiles. All moves are invalid under the rules. However, the problem requires selecting one of the directions, and since no direction is strictly better than others in this scenario, any direction is acceptable.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile positioning.

For example:\n   - Horizontal: All rows have distinct values (e.g., Row 0: 64, 8, 512, 16; Row 1: 4, 512, 16, 32).\n   - Vertical: All columns have distinct values (e.g., Column 0: 64, 4, 16, 32; Column 1: 8, 512, 64, 8).\n3. **Valid Moves**: A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, no move will change the board state (tiles cannot shift into empty spaces because there are none, and no merges are possible).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Swiping left or right does not change the board, as all tiles are already in their leftmost\/rightmost positions with no merges.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Swiping up or down also does not change the board, as all tiles are already in their topmost\/bottommost positions with no merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves leave the board unchanged, making them invalid. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we choose based on strategic positioning (e.g., aligning larger tiles for potential future merges, though none are possible here). \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and check for valid moves (merges or empty spaces to shift tiles into). The current board has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent equal tiles that can merge.

Since the grid is full (no 0s), tiles cannot shift left, and no merges occur. **Invalid move**.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Similarly, all tiles in each row are distinct. Tiles cannot shift right (no 0s), and no merges occur. **Invalid move**.  \n3. **UP**: Checking columns, all vertical tiles are distinct (no adjacent equal tiles). Tiles cannot shift up (no 0s), and no merges occur. **Invalid move**.  \n4. **DOWN**: Checking columns, all vertical tiles are distinct (no adjacent equal tiles). Tiles cannot shift down (no 0s), and no merges occur. **Invalid move**.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full (no 0s), and there are no adjacent equal tiles in any direction. Thus, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, any direction is technically invalid, but we select the most neutral option.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential for merging tiles in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is full (no empty tiles, 0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number to merge.

Shifting down would not merge any tiles, and no tiles would move (grid is full). No merges or movement.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is completely filled with no empty tiles, and no two adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same number. Thus, **no valid moves** exist, as no merges or tile movements are possible. However, per the problem constraints, the answer must be one of the four directions. Given no valid moves, any direction is technically invalid, but we select one as required.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move for the given 4x4 grid at epoch 100, we analyze the validity of each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). A valid move requires either adjacent tiles of the same number (to merge) or empty spaces (0s) to shift tiles into. \n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe grid is fully occupied (no 0s), so valid moves depend on adjacent tiles with the same number. We check all rows (horizontal adjacency) and columns (vertical adjacency):\n\n- **Rows (Horizontal Check):**  \n  - Row 0: [64, 8, 512, 16] – All unique.  \n  - Row 1: [4, 512, 16, 32] – All unique.  \n  - Row 2: [16, 64, 8, 128] – All unique.  \n  - Row 3: [32, 8, 2, 256] – All unique.  \n\n- **Columns (Vertical Check):**  \n  - Column 0: [64, 4, 16, 32] – All unique.  \n  - Column 1: [8, 512, 64, 8] – 8s are in rows 0 and 3 (non-adjacent, separated by 512 and 64).  \n  - Column 2: [512, 16, 8, 2] – All unique.  \n  - Column 3: [16, 32, 128, 256] – All unique.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nNo adjacent tiles (horizontal or vertical) have the same number, and there are no empty spaces.

Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n64|8|512|16\n4|512|16|32\n16|64|8|128\n32|8|2|256\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

For row 2 (2|0|0|2), the two 2s will move left, resulting in 2|2|0|0. Since the two 2s are adjacent and equal, they merge into a 4, giving a score of 4. The row becomes 4|0|0|0. This merge is valid and strategic, as the merged 4 is placed in the leftmost position (a corner), which aligns with the goal of keeping larger tiles in corners.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Swiping right shifts all tiles in each row to the right. For row 2 (2|0|0|2), the two 2s will move right, resulting in 0|0|2|2. These two 2s merge into a 4, giving a score of 4. The row becomes 0|0|0|4. The merged 4 is placed in the rightmost position (another corner), which is also strategic but less critical than LEFT in this early epoch.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Swiping up shifts tiles upward. For column 0, the 2 in row 2 moves to row 0 (since rows 0-1 are empty). For column 3, the 2 in row 2 moves to row 0 (since rows 0-1 are empty). The resulting board has 2s in (0,0) and (0,3) with no adjacent equal tiles, so no merging occurs. No score is gained.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Swiping down shifts tiles downward. For column 0, the 2 in row 2 moves to row 3 (since row 3 is empty). For column 3, the 2 in row 2 moves to row 3 (since row 3 is empty). The resulting board has 2s in (3,0) and (3,3) with no adjacent equal tiles, so no merging occurs. No score is gained.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly LEFT and RIGHT result in merging (and scoring). Between these, LEFT places the merged 4 in the left corner of row 2, which is a strategic position to build larger tiles in subsequent moves. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n```\nThe only non-zero tiles are a 2 at (0,0) and a 4 at (2,0). All other tiles are empty (0).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Swiping left moves tiles to the left edge. However, the 2 at (0,0) and 4 at (2,0) are already at the leftmost positions. No tiles shift, and no empty spaces are filled by movement. This is not a valid move because no tiles are moved into empty spaces.\n\n2. **RIGHT**: Swiping right moves tiles to the right edge. The 2 at (0,0) moves to (0,3), and the 4 at (2,0) moves to (2,3). This is a valid move, but the 2 and 4 end up in non-corner positions (right edge), which is less strategic for future merging.\n\n3. **UP**: Swiping up moves tiles upward. The 4 at (2,0) moves to (1,0), and the 2 at (0,0) stays. The resulting board has 2 at (0,0) and 4 at (1,0). This is valid, but the 4 is not in a corner, reducing long-term merging potential.\n\n4. **DOWN**: Swiping down moves tiles downward. The 2 at (0,0) moves to (2,0), and the 4 at (2,0) moves to (3,0). The resulting board has 2 at (2,0) and 4 at (3,0). This positions the largest tile (4) in the bottom-left corner (a strategic corner), with the 2 directly above it. This setup facilitates future merging if new tiles (2 or 4) spawn in the same column, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move because it positions the 4 in the bottom-left corner (a corner) and the 2 above it, creating a structure conducive to future merging.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 2|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 2|0|0|0\nRow 3: 4|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Swiping left shifts all tiles in each row to the left. All non-zero tiles are already in the first column, so no merging occurs. The board remains unchanged, with no score gain.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Swiping right shifts all tiles in each row to the right. Non-zero tiles move to the last column, but no merging occurs (tiles are not adjacent). The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   0|0|0|2  \n   0|0|0|0  \n   0|0|0|2  \n   0|0|0|4  \n   ```  \n   No score gain.  \n3. **UP**: Swiping up shifts all tiles in each column upward. Focusing on column 0 (the only non-zero column):  \n   - Original column 0: [2 (row0), 0 (row1), 2 (row2), 4 (row3)].  \n   - Shifting up collapses the column to [2, 2, 4, 0].  \n   - The two adjacent 2s merge into a 4 (score +4), and the 4 shifts up to row1.  \n   - Resulting column 0: [4 (merged), 4 (shifted), 0, 0].  \n   The final board after UP:  \n   ```\n   4|0|0|0  \n   4|0|0|0  \n   0|0|0|0  \n   0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   Score gain of 4.  \n4. **DOWN**: Swiping down shifts all tiles in each column downward. For column 0:  \n   - Original column 0: [2 (row0), 0 (row1), 2 (row2), 4 (row3)].  \n   - Shifting down collapses the column to [0, 2, 2, 4].  \n   - The two adjacent 2s merge into a 4 (score +4), and the 4 remains in row3.  \n   - Resulting column 0: [0, 0, 4 (merged), 4 (original)].  \n   The final board after DOWN:  \n   ```\n   0|0|0|0  \n   0|0|0|0  \n   4|0|0|0  \n   4|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   Score gain of 4.  \n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nThe goal is to merge tiles strategically and keep larger tiles in a corner. Swiping UP places the merged 4s in the top-left corner area (rows 0 and 1 of column 0), which aligns with the strategy of consolidating larger tiles in a corner. This position also allows for potential future merges (e.g., swiping UP again to merge the two 4s into an 8).  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|0|2|0  \nRow 1: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### 1. Swipe LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: [4,0,2,0] shifts to [4,2,0,0] (no merge, as 4 and 2 are different).  \n- **Row 1**: [4,0,0,0] shifts to [4,0,0,0] (no change).  \n- **Result**: No merges, no score.  \n\n\n### 2. Swipe RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: [4,0,2,0] shifts to [0,0,4,2] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [4,0,0,0] shifts to [0,0,0,4] (no change).  \n- **Result**: No merges, no score.  \n\n\n### 3. Swipe UP:\n- **Column 0**: [4 (Row 0), 4 (Row 1), 0, 0] shifts up. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8) in Row 0, Column 0.  \n- **Column 2**: [2 (Row 0), 0, 0, 0] shifts up to Row 0, Column 2.  \n- **Result**: Merged 4s into 8 (score +8), with the 8 positioned in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for larger tiles).  \n\n\n### 4. Swipe DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: [4 (Row 0), 4 (Row 1), 0, 0] shifts down. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8) in Row 3, Column 0.  \n- **Column 2**: [2 (Row 0), 0, 0, 0] shifts down to Row 3, Column 2.  \n- **Result**: Merged 4s into 8 (score +8), but the 8 is positioned in the bottom-left corner (less strategic than the top-left corner).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwipping UP merges the two 4s into 8 (score +8) and positions the 8 in the top-left corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners. Swiping DOWN also merges the 4s but places the 8 in a less optimal corner. LEFT and RIGHT do not merge any tiles. Thus, UP is the best move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the potential outcomes of each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning (e.g., keeping larger tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 0 | 2 | 0  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 4 | 0  \n```\nThe largest tile is 8, and smaller tiles (2, 4) are scattered. The goal is to position tiles for future merges while keeping larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left. Row 0 becomes `8 | 2 | 0 | 0` (no merges), Row 3 becomes `4 | 0 | 0 | 0`.  \n   - 8 remains in the top-left corner, but 2 and 4 are spread across rows 0 and 3 with no immediate merging potential.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right. Row 0 becomes `0 | 0 | 8 | 2`, Row 3 becomes `0 | 0 | 0 | 4`.  \n   - 8 moves to a non-corner position (row 0, column 2), reducing strategic value. No merges occur.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift up. Column 0 remains `8 | 0 | 0 | 0`, Column 2 becomes `2 | 4 | 0 | 0`.  \n   - 8 stays in the top-left corner, but 2 and 4 are vertically adjacent in column 2 (rows 0 and 1) with no merging potential.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down. Column 0 becomes `0 | 0 | 0 | 8` (8 moves to bottom-left corner), Column 2 becomes `0 | 0 | 2 | 4` (2 moves to row 2, 4 stays in row 3).  \n   - 8 is positioned in the bottom-left corner (a strategic corner). 2 and 4 are vertically adjacent in column 2 (rows 2 and 3), creating potential for future merges if a new 2 or 4 is added nearby. For example, a new 4 in row 3, column 3 could merge with the existing 4 in row 3, column 2 when swiping RIGHT, and the 8 in the bottom-left corner can later merge with other 8s if formed.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN positions the largest tile (8) in a strategic corner (bottom-left) and aligns smaller tiles (2, 4) vertically for potential future merges. This is the most favorable option.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to position tiles for future merges while keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|2|4  \nRow 3: 8|0|4|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0\/1**: No change (all zeros).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,2,4] shifts left to [2,4,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: [8,0,4,0] shifts left to [8,4,0,0] (no merge).  \nResult: 8 remains in row 3, column 0, but no merges occur. The 4 in row 3, column 1 is isolated, limiting future merges.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0\/1**: No change (all zeros).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,2,4] remains [0,0,2,4] (already right-aligned).  \n- **Row 3**: [8,0,4,0] shifts right to [0,0,8,4] (no merge).  \nResult: 8 moves to row 3, column 2 (not a corner), reducing control over the largest tile.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [0,0,0,8] shifts up to [8,0,0,0] (8 moves to row 0, column 0).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,2,4] shifts up to [2,4,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,4,0] shifts up to [4,0,0,0] (no merge).  \nResult: 8 moves to the top-left corner, but tiles are spread across row 0, making future merges harder to coordinate.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [0,0,0,8] remains [0,0,0,8] (8 stays in row 3, column 0, a corner).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,2,4] remains [0,0,2,4] (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,4,0] shifts down to [0,0,0,4] (4 moves to row 3, column 3).  \nResult: Row 3 becomes [8,0,4,4]. The two 4s in row 3, columns 2 and 3 are now adjacent horizontally, setting up a potential merge in the next move (e.g., swiping LEFT would merge them into 8, which could then merge with the existing 8 in row 3, column 0 to form 16).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping DOWN keeps the largest tile (8) in the bottom-left corner and positions two 4s adjacently in row 3, enabling future merges. This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners and setting up for higher-scoring combinations.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging rules.

UP and DOWN are less effective (no score or invalid).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential, tile arrangement, and strategic positioning of larger tiles (especially the 16 in the bottom-left corner).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 2|0|0|4  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|2|0|0  \nRow 3: 16|0|0|0  \n```\nKey observations:\n- The 16 is in the bottom-left corner (row 3, column 0), a strategic position to protect larger tiles.\n- No immediate merges are possible in the current state (no adjacent tiles with the same value).\n- Empty spaces are abundant (12 zeros), so all moves are valid.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT:\n- Tiles shift left in each row.\n  - Row 0: [2,0,0,4] → [2,4,0,0] (no merge).\n  - Row 1: [0,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,0].\n  - Row 2: [4,2,0,0] → [4,2,0,0] (no merge).\n  - Row 3: [16,0,0,0] → [16,0,0,0] (no merge).\n- Result: No merges, 16 remains in the bottom-left, but no setup for future merges.\n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- Tiles shift right in each row.\n  - Row 0: [2,0,0,4] → [0,0,2,4] (no merge).\n  - Row 1: [0,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,0].\n  - Row 2: [4,2,0,0] → [0,0,4,2] (no merge).\n  - Row 3: [16,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,16] (16 moves to bottom-right).\n- Result: No merges, 16 moves to a less strategic corner (bottom-right), worse for future merging.\n\n#### 3. UP:\n- Tiles shift up in each column.\n  - Column 0: [2,0,4,16] → [2,4,16,0] (no merge).\n  - Column 1: [0,0,2,0] → [2,0,0,0] (2 moves from row 2, column 1 to row 0, column 1).\n  - Column 2: [0,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,0].\n  - Column 3: [4,0,0,0] → [4,0,0,0] (no merge).\n- Resulting board after shifting:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 2|2|0|4  \n  Row 1: 4|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 16|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n  ```\n- Key benefit: Two 2s are now adjacent in row 0 (columns 0 and 1). This sets up a future merge (e.g., a subsequent LEFT swipe would merge them into a 4, gaining score). The 16 remains in row 2, column 0 (still in the left column, near the bottom).\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- Tiles shift down in each column.\n  - Column 0: [2,0,4,16] → [0,2,4,16] (no merge).\n  - Column 1: [0,0,2,0] → [0,0,0,2] (2 moves to row 3, column 1).\n  - Column 2: [0,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,0].\n  - Column 3: [4,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,4] (4 moves to row 3, column 3).\n- Resulting board after shifting:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 1: 2|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 4|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 16|2|0|4  \n  ```\n- Result: No merges, 16 remains in the bottom-left, but no setup for future merges (tiles are scattered with no adjacent duplicates).\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move. It positions two 2s adjacently in row 0, creating a future merge opportunity (e.g., with a subsequent LEFT swipe). This strategic setup aligns with maximizing score potential, while keeping the 16 in a favorable position (left column).\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

The row becomes `[16,8,8,0]`.  \n\nAfter a LEFT swipe, the board becomes:  \n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 16|8|8|0  \n```  \nThis move merges the `4`s in Row 3, gains 8 points, and keeps the largest tile (16) in the bottom-left corner (Row 3, Column 0), a strategic position. The adjacent `8`s in Row 3, Columns 1-2 can merge in a subsequent LEFT swipe, creating opportunities for higher scores.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.  \n- **Row 1**: `[2,0,0,0]` shifts right to `[0,0,0,2]`.  \n- **Row 2**: `[4,0,0,0]` shifts right to `[0,0,0,4]`.  \n- **Row 3**: `[16,4,4,8]` shifts right, but the `4`s are not adjacent after shifting (due to the `16` blocking). No merging occurs, and the row becomes `[0,16,8,8]`.  \n\nAfter a RIGHT swipe, the board becomes:  \n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 3: 0|16|8|8  \n```  \nThis move spreads the larger tiles (16, 8, 8) across the row, avoiding a corner, which is less strategic.

No score is gained, and the largest tile (16) is in Row 2, Column 0, which is less optimal than the bottom-left corner.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \nTiles are already at the bottom of their columns (no empty spaces below them). No movement or merging occurs. The board remains unchanged except for a new tile spawning, which is unproductive.\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe LEFT swipe is optimal: it merges the `4`s in Row 3 for an immediate score gain, keeps the largest tile (16) in the bottom-left corner, and positions the `8`s in Row 3 to merge in a subsequent move.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given game board.

This setup allows for a future merge into 32, while keeping larger tiles consolidated in a corner—key for strategic progression.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|2|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|8|0|0  \nRow 3: 16|16|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `2|2|0|0` shift left, merging the two `2`s into `4`. New row: `4|0|0|0`. Score += 4.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `4|8|0|0` shift left (no merges, as `4` and `8` are distinct). New row: `4|8|0|0`.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `16|16|0|0` shift left, merging the two `16`s into `32`. New row: `32|0|0|0`. Score += 32.  \n\nAfter LEFT (before new tile):  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|8|0|0  \nRow 3: 32|0|0|0  \n\nThis consolidates larger tiles (32, 4, 4) in the left column, setting up for future merges (e.g., the two `4`s in column 0 could merge with a subsequent UP swipe).  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `2|2|0|0` shift right, merging the two `2`s into `4`. New row: `0|0|0|4`. Score += 4.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `4|8|0|0` shift right (no merges). New row: `0|0|4|8`.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `16|16|0|0` shift right, merging the two `16`s into `32`. New row: `0|0|0|32`. Score += 32.  \n\nAfter RIGHT (before new tile):  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 2: 0|0|4|8  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|32  \n\nThis consolidates larger tiles in the right column, but the right column has less potential for future merges (e.g., `4` in row 1, column 3 and `8` in row 2, column 3 are distinct and cannot merge).  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Tiles shift upward. Columns are processed top-to-bottom:  \n  - Column 0: `0, 2, 4, 16` → no merges (all distinct).  \n  - Column 1: `0, 2, 8, 16` → no merges (all distinct).  \n  - Columns 2-3: All zeros.  \n\nNo merges occur, and the board remains unchanged. Score += 0.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles shift downward. Columns are processed bottom-to-top:  \n  - Column 0: `0, 2, 4, 16` → no merges (all distinct).  \n  - Column 1: `0, 2, 8, 16` → no merges (all distinct).  \n  - Columns 2-3: All zeros.  \n\nNo merges occur, and the board remains unchanged. Score += 0.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 36 points (4 + 32) from merging `2`s and `16`s. However, LEFT consolidates larger tiles (32, 4, 4) in the left column, creating opportunities for future merges (e.g., merging the `4`s in column 0 with a subsequent UP swipe). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner for better long-term merging potential.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up future merges.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|0|0\nRow 1: 4|0|0|0\nRow 2: 4|8|0|0\nRow 3: 32|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles in each row shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gained. Not useful.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles in each row shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gained. Not useful.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift upward in columns, with merging possible in vertical adjacent tiles.  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles [4, 4, 4, 32] shift up. The top two 4s merge into 8 (score +8). The remaining 4 shifts up to row 1, resulting in [8, 4, 0, 32].  \n   - **Column 1**: Tiles [0, 0, 8, 0] shift up, moving the 8 to row 0, resulting in [8, 0, 0, 0].  \n   - Columns 2 and 3: All zeros, no change.  \n\n   Post-UP board:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 8|8|0|0  \n   Row 1: 4|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 32|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   This creates two adjacent 8s in Row 0, which can merge into 16 on a subsequent LEFT swipe, setting up future score gains. The 32 remains in the bottom-left corner (a strategic position).\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift downward in columns, with merging possible in vertical adjacent tiles.  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles [4, 4, 4, 32] shift down. The bottom two 4s (rows 1 and 2) merge into 8 (score +8). The remaining 4 shifts down to row 1, resulting in [0, 4, 8, 32].  \n   - **Column 1**: Tiles [0, 0, 8, 0] shift down, moving the 8 to row 3, resulting in [0, 0, 0, 8].  \n   - Columns 2 and 3: All zeros, no change.  \n\n   Post-DOWN board:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 4|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 8|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 32|8|0|0  \n   ```  \n   While this merges 4s, the 8 in Row 3 (column 1) is isolated, with no immediate future merge potential. The 32 remains in the bottom-left, but the setup is less favorable than UP.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is optimal because it merges 4s for an immediate score of 8, positions two 8s adjacently in Row 0 (enabling a future 16 merge), and keeps the 32 in the corner. \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on merging potential, tile arrangement, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8|8|0|0\nRow 1: 4|0|0|0\nRow 2: 32|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|8\n```\nThe largest tile is 32, followed by 8s, 4, and another 8 in the bottom-right.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in `16|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 1: 4 shifts left to `4|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 2: 32 shifts left to `32|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 3: 8 shifts left to `8|0|0|0`.  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     16|0|0|0  \n     4|0|0|0  \n     32|0|0|0  \n     8|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - All tiles stack in the left column. This aligns larger tiles (32, 16, 8, 4) vertically, which is strategic for future merges (e.g., potential 16+16 or 32+32 if new tiles appear).\n\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in `0|0|0|16`.  \n   - Row 1: 4 shifts right to `0|0|0|4`.  \n   - Row 2: 32 shifts right to `0|0|0|32`.  \n   - Row 3: 8 stays in the rightmost column.  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     0|0|0|16  \n     0|0|0|4  \n     0|0|0|32  \n     0|0|0|8  \n     ```  \n   - All tiles stack in the right column. While this also merges the 8s, the larger tiles (32, 16, 8, 4) are vertically aligned but less centralized compared to the left column.\n\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - No merges occur, as all vertical columns have distinct values. Tiles shift upward but remain unmerged. This does not contribute to scoring or strategic positioning.  \n\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - No merges occur, similar to UP. Tiles shift downward but remain unmerged, providing no immediate benefit.  \n\n\n### Strategic Preference:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the 8s for 16 points, but LEFT aligns tiles in the left column. This centralizes larger tiles (32, 16, 8, 4) vertically, making it easier to merge them in future moves (e.g., if a new 4 or 8 appears in the left column). Keeping larger tiles in a corner (left column here) is a common strategy to avoid blocking and facilitate future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on strategic goals, such as positioning larger tiles in corners and setting up future merges. The game board is:\n\n```\n16|0|0|0\n4|0|0|0\n32|0|0|0\n8|4|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles). The board remains mostly unchanged, with tiles clustered on the left. This does not create immediate merging opportunities.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, with no merges. Larger tiles (16, 32) move to the right edge, but this scatters them across different rows, reducing the potential for vertical merges. Less strategic for corner positioning.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward. Column 0 (16, 4, 32, 8) remains unchanged (no merges), but the 4 in column 1, row 3 shifts up to row 0, column 1. This positions the 4 in the top row, adjacent to the 16 in row 0, column 0. This setup increases the potential for future horizontal merges (e.g., if another 4 spawns in row 0, column 2, moving left would merge the two 4s into 8). Larger tiles (32, 16) remain in the left column, a corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward, but no merges occur. The board remains nearly unchanged, with no meaningful repositioning of tiles to facilitate future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving **UP** positions the 4 in the top row, creating opportunities for horizontal merges in future moves, while keeping larger tiles (32, 16) in the left column (a corner). This aligns with strategic goals better than other directions.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on valid moves and strategic positioning of tiles. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 16|4|0|0\nRow 1: 4|16|0|0\nRow 2: 32|0|0|0\nRow 3: 8|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Valid Moves**: A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or moving tiles into empty spaces. Currently, no adjacent tiles have the same number, so valid moves depend on tiles shifting into empty spaces.\n- **Larger Tiles**: The largest tile is 32 (row 2, column 0). Strategic play involves keeping larger tiles in corners to facilitate future merges.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles in each row are already shifted to the leftmost positions (no empty spaces to the left of non-zero tiles). Swiping left would not move any tiles. **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles in each row can shift to the right into empty spaces:  \n   - Row 0: `16|4|0|0` → `0|0|16|4`  \n   - Row 1: `4|16|0|0` → `0|0|4|16`  \n   - Row 2: `32|0|0|0` → `0|0|0|32`  \n   - Row 3: `8|0|0|0` → `0|0|0|8`  \n   All tiles move right, filling empty spaces. **Valid move**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Columns are already filled with non-zero tiles (column 0 has `16,4,32,8`; column 1 has `4,16,0,0` with no empty spaces above non-zero tiles). Swiping up would not move any tiles. **Invalid move**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Column 1 has `4,16,0,0`, where tiles can shift down into empty spaces:  \n   - Column 1: `4|16|0|0` → `0|0|4|16` (tiles move to the bottom).  \n   Other columns (0, 2, 3) have no empty spaces to shift tiles downward. Only column 1 experiences movement. **Valid move**, but less impactful than RIGHT.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nSwiping RIGHT moves all tiles to the right edge, consolidating them and leaving empty spaces on the left. This positions tiles for potential future merges (e.g., if new tiles appear on the left, subsequent left swipes could align same-numbered tiles). RIGHT is more effective than DOWN in creating flexibility for future moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|16|4\nRow 1: 0|0|4|16\nRow 2: 0|0|0|32\nRow 3: 16|0|0|8\n```\nKey observations:\n- The largest tile is 32, located at (row 2, column 3) (bottom-right corner).\n- Other significant tiles: 16s at (0,2), (1,3), (3,0); 8 at (3,3); 4s at (0,3), (1,2).\n- No immediate merges are possible (no adjacent equal tiles).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### LEFT:\n- Tiles shift left in each row. No merges occur. Resulting board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 16|4|0|0\n  Row 1: 4|16|0|0\n  Row 2: 32|0|0|0\n  Row 3: 16|8|0|0\n  ```\n- 32 moves to (2,0) (left edge), breaking its corner position. Tiles are spread left but lack strategic grouping.\n\n#### RIGHT:\n- Tiles shift right in each row. No merges occur. Resulting board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 0|0|16|4\n  Row 1: 0|0|4|16\n  Row 2: 0|0|0|32\n  Row 3: 0|0|16|8\n  ```\n- 32 remains in (2,3) (bottom-right corner), but tiles are scattered with minimal grouping.\n\n#### UP:\n- Tiles shift up in each column. No merges occur. Resulting board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 16|0|16|4\n  Row 1: 0|0|4|16\n  Row 2: 0|0|0|32\n  Row 3: 0|0|0|8\n  ```\n- 32 stays in (2,3), but 16 from (3,0) moves to (0,0), creating vertical spread without clear strategic benefit.\n\n#### DOWN:\n- Tiles shift down in each column. No merges occur, but tiles group toward the bottom. Resulting board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 0|0|0|4\n  Row 1: 0|0|0|16\n  Row 2: 0|0|16|32\n  Row 3: 16|0|4|8\n  ```\n- 32 remains in (2,3) (bottom-right corner), a strong strategic position.\n- 16 from (0,2) moves to (2,2), adjacent to 32, potentially enabling future merges (e.g., if another 16 appears in (2,3)).\n- Tiles group toward the bottom and right, aligning with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in corners.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move. It preserves the 32 in the bottom-right corner, groups tiles strategically, and positions smaller tiles to support future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on strategic goals (e.g., keeping larger tiles in corners and enabling future merges).

However, larger tiles (64, 32) are scattered (64 in top-right, 32 in middle), less consolidated than LEFT.\n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- Columns are processed, but no adjacent equal tiles merge. Tiles shift up (e.g., Column 0: [0,8,0,16] → [8,16,0,0]), but no score is gained. Valid but suboptimal.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- Columns are processed, but no adjacent equal tiles merge. Tiles shift down (e.g., Column 0: [0,8,0,16] → [0,0,8,16]), but no score is gained. Valid but suboptimal.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 96 points, but LEFT consolidates larger tiles (64, 32) in the left column, aligning with a corner strategy for future merges. This makes LEFT the better choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile arrangement, potential merges, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|0|0\nRow 1: 8|16|2|0\nRow 2: 64|0|0|0\nRow 3: 32|4|8|0\n```\nKey observations:\n- No adjacent tiles with the same value exist, so no immediate merges are possible.\n- The largest tile is 64 (row 2, column 0), followed by 32 (row 3, column 0), 16 (row 1, column 1), and 8s (row 1, column 0; row 3, column 2).\n- Strategic goals include keeping larger tiles in a corner (to facilitate future merges) and arranging smaller tiles to enable incremental merging.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift to the leftmost possible positions. No merges occur (all non-zero tiles in each row are already left-aligned with no gaps between them). The board remains nearly unchanged, preserving the 64 in the bottom-left corner (row 2, column 0) and 32 in row 3, column 0. This maintains a stable corner for larger tiles, which is a common strategy to avoid scattering high-value tiles.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift to the rightmost positions. For example:\n   - Row 0: [4,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,4]\n   - Row 1: [8,16,2,0] → [0,8,16,2]\n   - Row 2: [64,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,64]\n   - Row 3: [32,4,8,0] → [0,32,4,8]  \n   This scatters larger tiles (64, 32, 16) across different columns, making it harder to merge them in future moves.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward. For example:\n   - Column 1: [0,16,0,4] → [16,4,0,0]\n   - Column 2: [0,2,0,8] → [2,8,0,0]  \n   This moves smaller tiles (e.g., 16, 4, 2, 8) into the top rows, disrupting the stability of larger tiles (64, 32) in the bottom rows. Larger tiles are better kept in lower rows to avoid being blocked by smaller tiles.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward. For example:\n   - Column 1: [0,16,0,4] → [0,0,16,4]\n   - Column 2: [0,2,0,8] → [0,0,2,8]  \n   This pushes smaller tiles further down but does not meaningfully group larger tiles. The 64 and 32 remain in column 0 but are separated by smaller tiles (8, 4), reducing their potential for future merges.\n\n### Strategic Conclusion:\nThe LEFT move preserves the current arrangement of larger tiles (64, 32) in the left column, keeping them in a corner. This aligns with the strategy of consolidating high-value tiles to facilitate future merges. Other moves either scatter large tiles or disrupt their positioning, making LEFT the most strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|0|4\nRow 1: 8|16|2|0\nRow 2: 64|0|0|0\nRow 3: 32|4|8|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [4,0,0,4] → Tiles shift left, merging the two 4s into 8. Result: [8,0,0,0]. Score gain: 8.  \n- **Row 1**: [8,16,2,0] → Tiles shift left (no merges, as all values are distinct). Result: [8,16,2,0].  \n- **Row 2**: [64,0,0,0] → Tiles shift left (no merges). Result: [64,0,0,0].  \n- **Row 3**: [32,4,8,0] → Tiles shift left (no merges). Result: [32,4,8,0].  \n- **Empty spaces**: 8 total (spread across rows 0, 1, 2, 3).  \n- **Strategy**: Large tiles (64, 32) remain in the left column, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner. The merged 8 in row 0, column 0 could potentially merge with the 8 in row 1, column 0 in future moves (e.g., a subsequent UP swipe).  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [4,0,0,4] → Tiles shift right, merging the two 4s into 8. Result: [0,0,0,8]. Score gain: 8.  \n- **Row 1**: [8,16,2,0] → Tiles shift right (no merges). Result: [0,8,16,2].  \n- **Row 2**: [64,0,0,0] → Tiles shift right (no merges). Result: [0,0,0,64].  \n- **Row 3**: [32,4,8,0] → Tiles shift right (no merges). Result: [0,32,4,8].  \n- **Empty spaces**: 8 total (spread across rows 0, 1, 2, 3).  \n- **Strategy**: Large tiles (64, 32, 16) are scattered across the right side, making it harder to merge them strategically.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are checked for merges. All columns have distinct values (e.g., column 0: [4,8,64,32]; column 1: [0,16,0,4]; etc.). No merges occur.  \n- Result: No score gain, and tiles remain mostly unchanged.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are checked for merges. All columns have distinct values (e.g., column 0: [4,8,64,32]; column 1: [0,16,0,4]; etc.). No merges occur.  \n- Result: No score gain, and tiles remain mostly unchanged.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the 4s in row 0 for a score of 8. However, LEFT keeps large tiles (64, 32) in the left column, aligning with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in a corner. This setup also enables potential future merges (e.g., merging the 8 in row 0, column 0 with the 8 in row 1, column 0 via a UP swipe). Thus, LEFT is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. The goal is to merge tiles for higher scores and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|0|0\nRow 1: 8|16|2|0\nRow 2: 64|0|16|0\nRow 3: 32|4|8|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n   Result: No score, minimal tile rearrangement.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n   Result: No score, minimal tile rearrangement.  \n\n3. **UP**: Columns are processed top-to-bottom.  \n   - **Column 0**: [8, 8, 64, 32]. The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). The column becomes [16, 64, 32, 0].  \n   - Other columns (1-3) have no merges.  \n   Result: Score +16. Larger tiles (64, 32) move up to rows 1 and 2 of column 0, leaving smaller tiles (16) in row 0.  \n\n4. **DOWN**: Columns are processed bottom-to-top.  \n   - **Column 0**: [8, 8, 64, 32]. The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). The column becomes [0, 16, 64, 32].  \n   - Other columns (1-3) have no merges.  \n   Result: Score +16. Larger tiles (64, 32) remain in rows 2 and 3 of column 0 (a corner), with the merged 16 in row 1 of column 0.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nLarger tiles (64, 32) are better positioned in a corner (column 0) for future merges. Swiping DOWN keeps 64 and 32 in rows 2 and 3 of column 0, preserving their corner placement. Swiping UP moves them to rows 1 and 2, which is less ideal for long-term strategy. Thus, DOWN is preferred.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize immediate score and strategically position larger tiles for future merges.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 16|0|2|0\nRow 2: 64|16|16|0\nRow 3: 32|4|8|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \nTiles shift left, merging adjacent equal values in each row:  \n- **Row 0**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 1**: `[16, 0, 2, 0]` → shifts to `[16, 2, 0, 0]` (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: `[64, 16, 16, 0]` → 16s merge into 32, resulting in `[64, 32, 0, 0]` (score +32).  \n- **Row 3**: `[32, 4, 8, 8]` → 8s merge into 16, resulting in `[32, 4, 16, 0]` (score +16).  \n\n**Resulting Board After LEFT**:  \n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 16|2|0|0  \nRow 2: 64|32|0|0  \nRow 3: 32|4|16|0  \n```  \n**Total Score Gain**: 32 + 16 = 48. Larger tiles (64, 32) are positioned in the left corner, aligning for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \nTiles shift right, merging adjacent equal values in each row:  \n- **Row 0**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 1**: `[16, 0, 2, 0]` → shifts to `[0, 0, 16, 2]` (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: `[64, 16, 16, 0]` → 16s merge into 32, resulting in `[0, 0, 64, 32]` (score +32).  \n- **Row 3**: `[32, 4, 8, 8]` → 8s merge into 16, resulting in `[0, 32, 4, 16]` (score +16).  \n\n**Resulting Board After RIGHT**:  \n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|16|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|64|32  \nRow 3: 0|32|4|16  \n```  \n**Total Score Gain**: 32 + 16 = 48. Larger tiles (64, 32) are positioned in the right corner but less aligned for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \nTiles shift up, merging adjacent equal values in each column. No merges occur because no adjacent equal tiles exist in columns. Tiles move into empty spaces in the top rows, but no score is gained.  \n\n**Resulting Board After UP**:  \n```\nRow 0: 16|16|2|8  \nRow 1: 64|4|16|0  \nRow 2: 32|0|8|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n```  \n**Total Score Gain**: 0. No immediate score, and larger tiles are scattered.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \nTiles shift down, but no tiles can move (all tiles are already at the bottom of their columns). This is an invalid move as no tiles shift or merge.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 48 points, but LEFT strategically positions the largest tile (64) in the left corner with smaller tiles (32) aligned below it, optimizing for future merges. UP and DOWN are less effective (no score or invalid).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

This positions larger tiles in a corner (left) and creates potential for future merges (e.g., 32s or 16s could align vertically\/horizontally in subsequent moves).\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right.  \n   - Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8]` → `[0, 0, 0, 8]` (no change).  \n   - Row 1: `[16, 2, 0, 0]` → `[0, 0, 16, 2]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: `[64, 32, 0, 0]` → `[0, 0, 64, 32]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: `[32, 4, 16, 0]` → `[0, 32, 4, 16]` (no merges).  \n   - Result: Tiles cluster on the right, but the largest tile (64) is not in a corner, reducing strategic alignment for future merges.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift up.  \n   - Column 0: `[0, 16, 64, 32]` → `[16, 64, 32, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: `[0, 2, 32, 4]` → `[2, 32, 4, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: `[0, 0, 0, 16]` → `[16, 0, 0, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: `[8, 0, 0, 0]` → `[8, 0, 0, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Result: Tiles spread across rows, with no clear corner clustering of large tiles, limiting future merge potential.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift down.  \n   - Column 0: `[0, 16, 64, 32]` → `[0, 16, 64, 32]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: `[0, 2, 32, 4]` → `[0, 2, 32, 4]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: `[0, 0, 0, 16]` → `[0, 0, 0, 16]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: `[8, 0, 0, 0]` → `[0, 0, 0, 8]` (no merges).  \n   - Result: Minimal change, with tiles remaining scattered and no strategic clustering.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping **LEFT** clusters larger tiles (64, 32, 32, 16, 8) along the left edge, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.

Score increases by 8 (merged tile value).  \n   **Result**: Merges two 4s into 8, creating a strategic advantage.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP move is the only direction that results in a merge (two 4s into 8), increasing the score and improving board positioning. Other directions do not yield merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize score through tile merges and strategically position larger tiles for future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 4 | 4\nRow 1: 16 | 32 | 16 | 0\nRow 2: 64 | 4 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 32 | 8 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift left. The two `4`s in columns 2 and 3 merge into `8`, resulting in `8 | 2 | 8 | 0` (score +8).  \n   - Rows 1-3: No merges occur (tiles are distinct or spaced apart).  \n   - Outcome: Larger tiles (64, 32, 16, 8) cluster in the left column, but zeros are on the right.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift right. The two `4`s in columns 2 and 3 merge into `8`, resulting in `8 | 2 | 0 | 8` (score +8).  \n   - Row 1: Tiles shift right, resulting in `0 | 16 | 32 | 16` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: Tiles shift right, resulting in `0 | 0 | 4 | 64` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: Tiles shift right, resulting in `0 | 0 | 8 | 32` (no merges).  \n   - Outcome: Larger tiles (64, 32, 16, 8) cluster in the right column (corner), with zeros on the left.  \n\n3. **UP\/DOWN**:  \n   - No merges occur in any column, as all adjacent tiles are distinct. Tiles shift but do not combine, resulting in no score gain.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe key strategy in 2048 is to keep larger tiles in a corner to avoid blocking future merges. Swiping **RIGHT** positions the largest tile (64) in the bottom-right corner (row 2, column 3), with 32, 16, and 8 in the same column (rows 3, 1, 0). This clusters large tiles in the right corner, while zeros (potential spawn points for new 2\/4 tiles) are on the left. New small tiles on the left can be merged toward the right, preserving the large tiles in the corner for future combinations.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic placement of larger tiles. The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 0|8|2|8\nRow 1: 0|16|32|16\nRow 2: 0|32|64|4\nRow 3: 0|0|32|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   For each row, tiles shift left, filling empty spaces.  \n   - Row 0: `0|8|2|8` → `8|2|8|0` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: `0|16|32|16` → `16|32|16|0` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: `0|32|64|4` → `32|64|4|0` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: `0|0|32|8` → `32|8|0|0` (no merges).  \n   Tiles shift left, creating empty spaces on the right. This is a valid move as tiles move into empty spaces.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right. For each row:  \n   - Row 0: `0|8|2|8` → remains `0|8|2|8` (no movement).  \n   - Row 1: `0|16|32|16` → remains `0|16|32|16` (no movement).  \n   - Row 2: `0|32|64|4` → remains `0|32|64|4` (no movement).  \n   - Row 3: `0|0|32|8` → remains `0|0|32|8` (no movement).  \n   No tiles move, so this is not a valid move.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift up. For each column:  \n   - Column 0: All zeros → no change.  \n   - Column 1: `8|16|32|0` → remains `8|16|32|0` (no movement).  \n   - Column 2: `2|32|64|32` → remains `2|32|64|32` (no movement).  \n   - Column 3: `8|16|4|8` → remains `8|16|4|8` (no movement).  \n   No tiles move, so this is not a valid move.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift down. For each column:  \n   - Column 0: All zeros → no change.  \n   - Column 1: `8|16|32|0` → `0|8|16|32` (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: `2|32|64|32` → remains `2|32|64|32` (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: `8|16|4|8` → remains `8|16|4|8` (no merges).  \n   While some tiles shift, no merges occur, and the board structure remains largely unchanged. This is less impactful than LEFT.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only move that meaningfully shifts tiles and creates empty spaces for future merges is **LEFT**. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for possible merges and strategic positioning when swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up for future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|2|8|0  \nRow 1: 16|32|16|0  \nRow 2: 32|64|4|0  \nRow 3: 32|8|0|4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles merge in any row.  \n- Result: No score gain. Poor for immediate progress.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles merge in any row.  \n- Result: No score gain. No better than LEFT.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift upward, merging vertically in columns:  \n  - **Column 0**: [8, 16, 32, 32] → The two 32s in rows 2 and 3 merge into 64 (score +64). Tiles shift up to [8, 16, 64, 0].  \n  - Other columns (1, 2, 3) have no merges but shift upward.  \n- Post-UP board:  \n  Row 0: 8|2|8|4  \n  Row 1: 16|32|16|0  \n  Row 2: 64|64|4|0  \n  Row 3: 0|8|0|0  \n- Strategic Value: The 64s in Row 2 (columns 0 and 1) are adjacent, setting up for a future LEFT swipe to merge them into 128. Empty spaces in Row 3 keep larger tiles (8, 16, 64) in the top half, aligning with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift downward, merging vertically in columns:  \n  - **Column 0**: [8, 16, 32, 32] → The two 32s in rows 2 and 3 merge into 64 (score +64). Tiles shift down to [0, 8, 16, 64].  \n  - Other columns (1, 2, 3) have no merges but shift downward.  \n- Post-DOWN board:  \n  Row 0: 0|2|0|0  \n  Row 1: 8|32|8|0  \n  Row 2: 16|64|16|0  \n  Row 3: 64|8|4|4  \n- Strategic Value: The merged 64 in Row 3 (column 0) is isolated, with smaller tiles (4s) in Row 3 (columns 2 and 3). Less optimal for future merges compared to UP.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP provides an immediate 64-point merge and strategically positions large tiles (64s) in Row 2, adjacent for future merges. This is better than DOWN (isolated 64) or LEFT\/RIGHT (no merges).\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the resulting state, score gain, and strategic positioning of tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|2|8|4\nRow 1: 16|32|16|0\nRow 2: 64|64|4|0\nRow 3: 0|8|0|16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [8, 2, 8, 4] has no zeros or adjacent duplicates, so it remains unchanged.\n- **Row 1**: [16, 32, 16, 0] has no adjacent duplicates, so tiles shift left (no change in non-zero positions).\n- **Row 2**: [64, 64, 4, 0] contains adjacent 64s. These merge into 128, with 4 shifting left. Result: [128, 4, 0, 0]. Score gain: 128.\n- **Row 3**: [0, 8, 0, 16] shifts left to [8, 16, 0, 0] (no merges).\n\n**Resulting Board (LEFT)**:\n```\nRow 0: 8|2|8|4\nRow 1: 16|32|16|0\nRow 2: 128|4|0|0\nRow 3: 8|16|0|0\n```\n- Strategic Value: The 128 tile is positioned in the left edge (row 2, column 0), a corner-adjacent position, which aligns with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in corners.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [8, 2, 8, 4] has no zeros or adjacent duplicates, so it remains unchanged.\n- **Row 1**: [16, 32, 16, 0] shifts right to [0, 16, 32, 16] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [64, 64, 4, 0] contains adjacent 64s. These merge into 128, with 4 shifting right. Result: [0, 0, 128, 4]. Score gain: 128.\n- **Row 3**: [0, 8, 0, 16] shifts right to [0, 0, 8, 16] (no merges).\n\n**Resulting Board (RIGHT)**:\n```\nRow 0: 8|2|8|4\nRow 1: 0|16|32|16\nRow 2: 0|0|128|4\nRow 3: 0|0|8|16\n```\n- Strategic Value: The 128 tile is positioned in the middle-right (row 2, column 2), which is less ideal for corner consolidation.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- All columns have no adjacent duplicates, so no merges occur. Score gain: 0.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- All columns have no adjacent duplicates, so no merges occur. Score gain: 0.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT swipes yield a score gain of 128, but LEFT positions the 128 tile in a corner-adjacent area (row 2, column 0), which is better for long-term strategy (consolidating large tiles in corners). UP and DOWN provide no score gain and are suboptimal.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to identify a move that facilitates future merges and strategically positions larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|2|8|4\nRow 1: 16|32|16|8\nRow 2: 128|4|0|0\nRow 3: 8|16|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles in each row are already shifted left with no gaps. No merges occur, and the board remains unchanged. No score gain, and no strategic improvement.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles in rows 2 and 3 shift right (e.g., row 2 becomes `0|0|128|4`, row 3 becomes `0|0|8|16`). No merges occur, as no adjacent tiles in any row are equal after shifting. Minimal strategic value.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles in columns are already shifted up with no gaps. No merges occur, and the board remains unchanged. No score gain or strategic improvement.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles in columns 2 and 3 (which have empty spaces) shift down. For example:  \n   - Column 2 (originally `8|16|0|0`) shifts down to `0|0|8|16`.  \n   - Column 3 (originally `4|8|0|0`) shifts down to `0|0|4|8`.  \n\n   After shifting, the updated board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 8|2|0|0  \n   Row 1: 16|32|0|0  \n   Row 2: 128|4|8|4  \n   Row 3: 8|16|16|8  \n   ```  \n\n   Notably, row 3 now has adjacent `16` tiles (columns 1 and 2). This sets up a future merge opportunity (e.g., a subsequent LEFT swipe would merge these `16`s into a `32`, generating score). This strategic positioning of tiles aligns with the goal of creating merges for higher scores.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN swipe is optimal because it shifts tiles to create adjacent equal values (16s in row 3), enabling a future merge. This move strategically positions tiles for higher scores in subsequent turns.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 16 | 32 | 0 | 64  \nRow 2: 128 | 4 | 8 | 4  \nRow 3: 8 | 16 | 16 | 8  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [8, 2, 0, 0] → Tiles shift left, no merges (remains 8|2|0|0).  \n- **Row 1**: [16, 32, 0, 64] → Tiles shift left (16|32|64|0), no merges.  \n- **Row 2**: [128, 4, 8, 4] → Tiles shift left, no merges (remains 128|4|8|4).  \n- **Row 3**: [8, 16, 16, 8] → The two 16s merge into 32, resulting in 8|32|8|0.

Score increases by 32.  \n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- All columns are checked for upward movement. No adjacent tiles are equal, so no merges occur. No score gain.  \n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- All columns are checked for downward movement. No adjacent tiles are equal, so no merges occur. No score gain.  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\n- LEFT and RIGHT swipes both merge the 16s in Row 3, yielding 32 points.  \n- RIGHT swipe positions the 64 (a large tile) in the top-right corner (Row 1, Column 3), which aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.  \n- RIGHT swipe also leaves the 128 (the largest tile) in the bottom-left area (Row 2, Column 0), maintaining a corner-focused structure for future merges.  \n\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities, tile positioning, and strategic goals (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|8|2\nRow 1: 4|16|32|64\nRow 2: 128|4|8|4\nRow 3: 0|8|32|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,0,8,2] → shifts to [8,2,0,0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [4,16,32,64] → no movement (all distinct, no zeros).  \n   - Row 2: [128,4,8,4] → no movement (all distinct, no zeros).  \n   - Row 3: [0,8,32,8] → shifts to [8,32,8,0] (no merges).  \n   **Result**: No merges, 128 remains in row 2, column 0 (not a corner).\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,0,8,2] → no movement (tiles already right-aligned).  \n   - Row 1: [4,16,32,64] → no movement (all distinct, right-aligned).  \n   - Row 2: [128,4,8,4] → no movement (all distinct, right-aligned).  \n   - Row 3: [0,8,32,8] → no movement (tiles already right-aligned).  \n   **Result**: No merges, 128 remains in row 2, column 0 (not a corner).\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,4,128,0] → shifts to [4,128,0,0] (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: [0,16,4,8] → shifts to [16,4,8,0] (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [8,32,8,32] → shifts to [8,32,8,32] (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [2,64,4,8] → shifts to [2,64,4,8] (no merges).  \n   **Result**: No merges, 128 moves to row 1, column 0 (not a corner).\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,4,128,0] → shifts to [0,0,4,128] (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: [0,16,4,8] → shifts to [0,0,4,16+8?

The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up future merges.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 1: 32|8|2|32\nRow 2: 16|32|64|0\nRow 3: 8|8|4|0\nRow 4: 128|8|32|8\n```\n\n### LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 1**: Tiles are all distinct (32, 8, 2, 32). No merges; row remains `32|8|2|32`.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left into the empty space (0). No merges; row becomes `16|32|64|0`.\n- **Row 3**: Two adjacent 8s merge into 16 (score +16), and 4 shifts left. Row becomes `16|4|0|0`.\n- **Row 4**: Tiles are all distinct (128, 8, 32, 8). No merges; row remains `128|8|32|8`.\n\n**Result**: 16 points from merging 8s in Row 3. Strategically, the merged 16 in Row 3, Column 1 is positioned below a 16 in Row 2, Column 1, setting up a potential future UP swipe merge.\n\n\n### RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 1**: Tiles are all distinct (32, 8, 2, 32). No merges; row remains `32|8|2|32`.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right into the empty space (0). No merges; row becomes `0|16|32|64`.\n- **Row 3**: Two adjacent 8s merge into 16 (score +16), and 4 shifts right. Row becomes `0|0|4|16`.\n- **Row 4**: Tiles are all distinct (128, 8, 32, 8). No merges; row remains `128|8|32|8`.\n\n**Result**: 16 points from merging 8s in Row 3. The merged 16 in Row 3, Column 4 has less potential for future merges compared to LEFT.\n\n\n### UP Swipe:\n- **Column 1**: Tiles (32, 16, 8, 128) are all distinct. No merges; column remains `32|16|8|128`.\n- **Column 2**: Tiles (8, 32, 8, 8). The two 8s in Rows 3 and 4 merge into 16 (score +16). Column becomes `8|32|16|0`.\n- **Column 3**: Tiles (2, 64, 4, 32) are all distinct. No merges; column remains `2|64|4|32`.\n- **Column 4**: Tiles (32, 0, 0, 8) shift up.

No merges; column remains `32|16|8|128`.\n- **Column 2**: Tiles (8, 32, 8, 8). The two 8s in Rows 3 and 4 merge into 16 (score +16). Column becomes `0|8|32|16`.\n- **Column 3**: Tiles (2, 64, 4, 32) are all distinct. No merges; column remains `2|64|4|32`.\n- **Column 4**: Tiles (32, 0, 0, 8) shift down. No merges; column becomes `0|0|32|8`.\n\n**Result**: 16 points from merging 8s in Column 2. The merged 16 in Column 2, Row 4 has minimal future merge potential.\n\n\n### Strategic Evaluation:\nAll directions yield 16 points from one merge. However, LEFT is optimal because it positions a merged 16 (Row 3, Column 1) directly below a 16 (Row 2, Column 1). This setup allows a future UP swipe to merge these two 16s into 32, creating a higher-scoring opportunity.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for possible merges and strategic positioning of large tiles. The current board is:\n\n```\n32|8|2|32\n16|32|64|0\n16|4|16|0\n128|8|32|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles merge. All rows are already left-aligned (no empty spaces to fill), so no valid merges or movement. Not a useful move.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles merge. Rows 1 and 2 shift right into empty spaces, but no merges occur. No score gain.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Columns are processed upward. In column 0, the two 16s (row1 and row2) merge into 32 (score +32). The 128 (row3, column0) shifts up to row2, column0. However, this moves the largest tile (128) out of the bottom-left corner.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Columns are processed downward. In column 0, the two 16s (row1 and row2) merge into 32 (score +32). The 128 (row3, column0) remains in the bottom-left corner, which is strategic for future merges. Additionally, row1 after the move becomes `32|32|64|0`, setting up a potential merge of 32s with a subsequent LEFT swipe.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nDOWN is the best move because it preserves the largest tile (128) in the corner and sets up future merges.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the potential merges, score gains, and strategic positioning of tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 8 | 2 | 0\nRow 1: 32 | 32 | 64 | 0\nRow 2: 32 | 4 | 16 | 32\nRow 3: 128 | 8 | 32 | 8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `8, 8, 2, 0` → The two `8`s merge into `16`, resulting in `16, 2, 0, 0`. Score gain: `16`.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `32, 32, 64, 0` → The two `32`s merge into `64`, resulting in `64, 64, 0, 0`. Score gain: `64`.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles `32, 4, 16, 32` → No adjacent duplicates, so tiles shift left but no merges. Result: `32, 4, 16, 32`.\n- **Row 3**: Tiles `128, 8, 32, 8` → No adjacent duplicates, so tiles shift left but no merges. Result: `128, 8, 32, 8`.\n- **Total Score Gain**: `16 + 64 = 80`.\n- **Strategic Value**: Merges occur on the left side, aligning with the largest tile (`128` in the bottom-left corner). This groups larger tiles in the left corner, facilitating future merges.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `8, 8, 2, 0` → The two `8`s merge into `16`, shifting right to `0, 0, 2, 16`. Score gain: `16`.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `32, 32, 64, 0` → The two `32`s merge into `64`, shifting right to `0, 0, 64, 64`. Score gain: `64`.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles `32, 4, 16, 32` → No adjacent duplicates, so tiles shift right but no merges. Result: `32, 4, 16, 32`.\n- **Row 3**: Tiles `128, 8, 32, 8` → No adjacent duplicates, so tiles shift right but no merges. Result: `128, 8, 32, 8`.\n- **Total Score Gain**: `16 + 64 = 80`.\n- **Strategic Value**: Merges occur on the right side, but the largest tile (`128`) remains in the bottom-left corner. This spreads larger tiles across the grid, making future merges less efficient.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles `8, 32, 32, 128` → The two `32`s merge into `64`, resulting in `8, 64, 128, 0`. Score gain: `64`.\n- **Other Columns**: No merges (all tiles are distinct or non-adjacent).\n- **Total Score Gain**: `64`.\n- **Strategic Value**: Lower score gain and less alignment of large tiles in a corner.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles `8, 32, 32, 128` → The two `32`s merge into `64` when reversed, resulting in `0, 8, 64, 128`. Score gain: `64`.\n- **Other Columns**: No merges (all tiles are distinct or non-adjacent).\n- **Total Score Gain**: `64`.\n- **Strategic Value**: Lower score gain and less alignment of large tiles in a corner.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield a score of 80, but LEFT is strategically better because it aligns merged tiles (16, 64, 64) with the largest tile (128) in the bottom-left corner. This grouping facilitates future merges and maintains a compact structure, reducing the risk of gridlock.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, score gain, and tile positioning strategy (keeping larger tiles in a corner).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16 | 2 | 2 | 0  \nRow 1: 64 | 64 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 32 | 4 | 16 | 32  \nRow 3: 128 | 8 | 32 | 8  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [16, 2, 2, 0] → 2 and 2 merge into 4.

Result: [128, 8, 32, 8].  \n- **Total Score**: 4 + 128 = 132.  \n- **Tile Positioning**: Larger tiles (128) are spread across the right and left corners, which is less optimal for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Columns processed top to bottom**:  \n  - Column 0: [16, 64, 32, 128] (all distinct, no merges).  \n  - Column 1: [2, 64, 4, 8] (all distinct, no merges).  \n  - Column 2: [2, 0, 16, 32] (no merges, tiles shift up).  \n  - Column 3: [0, 0, 32, 8] (no merges, tiles shift up).  \n- **Total Score**: 0.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Columns processed bottom to top**:  \n  - Column 0: [16, 64, 32, 128] (all distinct, no merges).  \n  - Column 1: [2, 64, 4, 8] (all distinct, no merges).  \n  - Column 2: [2, 0, 16, 32] (no merges, tiles shift down).  \n  - Column 3: [0, 0, 32, 8] (no merges, tiles shift down).  \n- **Total Score**: 0.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 132 points, but LEFT consolidates larger tiles (128, 16) in the left column, aligning with the strategy of corner stacking. UP and DOWN provide no score and are suboptimal.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for possible merges and strategic positioning of tiles when swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up for future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|4|0|0\nRow 1: 128|0|16|0\nRow 2: 32|4|16|32\nRow 3: 128|8|32|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - No merges occur in any row. Tiles shift left but remain unmerged (e.g., Row 0: `16|4|0|0` stays the same).  \n   - No score gain. Not beneficial.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - No merges occur in any row. Tiles shift right but remain unmerged (e.g., Row 1: `128|0|16|0` becomes `0|0|128|16`).  \n   - No score gain. Not beneficial.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - **Column 1**: Tiles `[4, 0, 4, 8]` shift up to `[4, 4, 8, 0]`, merging the two `4`s into `8` (score +8).  \n   - **Column 2**: Tiles `[0, 16, 16, 32]` shift up to `[16, 16, 32, 0]`, merging the two `16`s into `32` (score +32).  \n   - Other columns have no merges.  \n   - Total score gain: `8 + 32 = 40`.  \n   - Resulting board after UP swipe:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 16|8|32|32  \n     Row 1: 128|0|0|8  \n     Row 2: 32|8|32|0  \n     Row 3: 128|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - Strategic advantage: The `32`s in Row 0 (columns 2 and 3) are adjacent, allowing a potential merge into `64` with a subsequent LEFT swipe. Larger tiles (e.g., `128`s) remain in column 0, preserving a corner for future growth.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - **Column 1**: Tiles `[4, 0, 4, 8]` shift down to `[0, 4, 4, 8]`, merging the two `4`s into `8` (score +8).  \n   - **Column 2**: Tiles `[0, 16, 16, 32]` shift down to `[0, 16, 16, 32]`, merging the two `16`s into `32` (score +32).  \n   - Other columns have no merges.  \n   - Total score gain: `8 + 32 = 40`.  \n   - Resulting board after DOWN swipe:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 16|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 128|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 32|8|32|32  \n     Row 3: 128|8|32|8  \n     ```  \n   - Strategic disadvantage: The `32`s in Row 2 (columns 2 and 3) are adjacent but less optimally positioned for future merges compared to the UP swipe. Larger tiles are spread out, reducing corner consolidation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP swipe provides the same immediate score as DOWN but better positions tiles for future merges (e.g., adjacent `32`s in Row 0) and consolidates larger tiles in a corner. \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential, score gain, and strategic tile arrangement.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|8|32|32  \nRow 1: 128|8|32|8  \nRow 2: 32|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 128|0|2|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: 16, 8, 32, 32 → 32s merge into 64 (score +64).

Other moves either yield lower scores or disrupt tile concentration.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging rules. The goal is to identify which move maximizes future merging potential or aligns with strategic placement of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 32 | 64 | 32 | 0  \nRow 1: 128 | 2 | 8 | 0  \nRow 2: 32 | 8 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 128 | 16 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Move**:  \nTiles in each row shift left. Since no adjacent tiles in any row are equal, no merges occur. The board remains nearly unchanged (e.g., Row 0: [32, 64, 32, 0] → [32, 64, 32, 0]). No score gain, and no meaningful rearrangement of tiles.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:  \nTiles in each row shift right. Again, no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row, so no merges. The board shifts tiles to the right (e.g., Row 0: [32, 64, 32, 0] → [0, 32, 64, 32]). No score gain, and larger tiles (e.g., 128s) move away from the left corner, which is suboptimal.  \n\n#### **UP Move**:  \nTiles in each column shift up. Columns have no adjacent equal tiles (e.g., Column 0: [32, 128, 32, 128]; Column 1: [64, 2, 8, 16]). No merges occur, and the board remains unchanged. No score gain or strategic improvement.  \n\n#### **DOWN Move**:  \nTiles in each column shift down. Columns 2 and 3 have empty spaces, allowing tiles to shift downward. For example:  \n- Column 2: [32 (Row 0), 8 (Row 1), 0, 0] → shifts to [0, 0, 32, 8].  \n- Column 3: All zeros, remains unchanged.  \n\nWhile no merges occur immediately, this move consolidates smaller tiles (32, 8) toward the bottom, freeing up space in the top rows. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles (128s in Column 0) in the corner and creating opportunities for future merges when new tiles (2 or 4) spawn in empty spaces.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nAll moves are valid, but **DOWN** is the best choice. It consolidates smaller tiles downward, maintains larger tiles (128s) in the left corner, and creates empty space in the top rows for future strategic merges.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate potential merges and score gains.

No merges occur. Score gain: 0.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nEach row shifts right, but no adjacent tiles are equal. No merges occur. Score gain: 0.  \n\n#### **UP**  \nEach column shifts up. Columns have no adjacent equal tiles after shifting. No merges occur. Score gain: 0.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \nEach column shifts down, allowing potential merges:  \n- **Column 0** (values: 32, 128, 32, 128):  \n  - 32 (row 0) and 32 (row 2) merge into 64 (score +64).  \n  - 128 (row 1) and 128 (row 3) merge into 256 (score +256).  \n- **Column 2** (values: 0, 0, 32, 0):  \n  - 32 (row 2) shifts to row 3 (no merge).  \n- **Column 3** (values: 4, 0, 0, 0):  \n  - 4 (row 0) shifts to row 3 (no merge).  \n- Other columns have no merges.  \n\nTotal score gain from DOWN: \\(64 + 256 = 320\\).  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nDOWN is the only move that triggers merges, resulting in a significant score gain.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

In contrast, UP leaves the merged 8 in row 0, which has no adjacent tiles to merge with immediately.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 64 | 0 | 16\nRow 1: 128 | 2 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 32 | 8 | 32 | 0\nRow 3: 128 | 16 | 8 | 8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left → `32 | 64 | 16 | 0` (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left → `128 | 2 | 0 | 0` (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left → `32 | 8 | 32 | 0` (no merges, as 32s are separated by 8).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left. The two 8s merge into 16 → `128 | 16 | 16 | 0` (score +16).  \n  **Result**: Merges occur in Row 3, and larger tiles (128s) remain in the left column (corner), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right → `0 | 32 | 64 | 16` (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right → `0 | 0 | 128 | 2` (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right → `0 | 32 | 8 | 32` (no merges, as 32s are separated by 8).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right. The two 8s merge into 16 → `128 | 16 | 0 | 16` (score +16).  \n  **Result**: Merges occur in Row 3, but merged 16s are spread across columns 1 and 3, which is less strategic for corner alignment.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed upward. No adjacent equal tiles are found in any column, so no merges occur.  \n  **Result**: No score gain, and no strategic improvement.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed downward. No adjacent equal tiles are found in any column, so no merges occur.  \n  **Result**: No score gain, and no strategic improvement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 16 points from merging 8s in Row 3. However, LEFT keeps larger tiles (128s) in the left column (corner), which is more strategic for future merges. RIGHT spreads merged 16s across columns, reducing alignment for future combinations. Thus, LEFT is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN.

Tiles shift downward but do not align for merging.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT moves merge the 32s in Row 3 for a score of 64. However, the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner favors LEFT. The existing large tiles (128s) are in the left column (Row 1, Column 0 and Row 3, Column 0). Moving LEFT keeps these 128s in the left column, reinforcing a corner concentration, which is optimal for future merges and avoiding gridlock.\n\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up future merges by keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|64|4|0\nRow 1: 128|2|64|0\nRow 2: 32|8|16|32\nRow 3: 128|64|16|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. Tiles shift left but no merges occur. No score gained. Poor setup for future moves.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- All rows have no adjacent equal tiles after shifting. Tiles shift right but no merges occur. No score gained. No meaningful setup.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 2** (values: [4, 64, 16, 16]) has two adjacent 16s. When shifted up, these merge into 32, adding 32 to the score. Other columns have no merges. The resulting board has scattered tiles with limited future merge potential.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 2** (values: [4, 64, 16, 16]) has two adjacent 16s. When shifted down, these merge into 32, adding 32 to the score. \n- **Column 3** (values: [0, 0, 32, 0]) shifts down, moving the 32 to the bottom row (row 3, column 3). \n- The bottom row (row 3) becomes `128|64|32|32` after the DOWN swipe. This creates adjacent 32s, setting up a potential merge (into 64) in the next move with a RIGHT swipe. This strategic setup is valuable for future scoring.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN swipe not only gains 32 points immediately but also positions the board for a future merge (32s in row 3), making it the best choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

This merge adds 64 to the score.  \n   After LEFT, row 3 has adjacent `64`s (columns 1 and 2), which can potentially merge in future moves. Larger tiles (e.g., `128`s) remain in the left column, a strategic corner.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: `32|64|0|0` → Tiles shift right to `0|0|32|64`; no merges.  \n   - **Row 1**: `128|2|4|0` → Tiles shift right to `0|128|2|4`; no merges.  \n   - **Row 2**: `32|8|64|4` → All tiles are non-zero and right-aligned; no merges.  \n   - **Row 3**: `128|64|32|32` → The two `32`s merge into `64`, resulting in `128|64|0|64`.

No merges occur because all tiles in columns are distinct, and no adjacent equal tiles exist. This results in no score gain and minimal strategic benefit.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles shift downward in each column. Similar to UP, no merges occur as tiles are distinct and no adjacent equals exist.

Swiping LEFT places the new 256 in the bottom-left corner, adjacent to the existing 128 in row 1, column 0. This aligns with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in a corner, making it easier to merge them in subsequent moves. Swiping RIGHT places the 256 in the bottom-right corner, which has no large adjacent tiles (only a 64 in row 0, column 3).

The two 32s (positions 2 and 3) merge into 64, shifting up to position 2. Result: [2, 128, 64, 0]. Score gain: 64.\n- Other columns (1-3) have no merges. Tiles shift up but remain unmerged.\n- Resulting board:\n  - Row 0: [2, 32, 64, 2]\n  - Row 1: [128, 2, 4, 8]\n  - Row 2: [64, 8, 64, 4]\n  - Row 3: [0, 0, 0, 256]\n- Key advantage: 256 remains in the bottom-right corner (strategic corner), and empty spaces (Row 3) allow future flexibility.\n\n### DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 0** (vertical processing): [2, 128, 32, 32]. Reversed column [32, 32, 128, 2] merges the two 32s into 64, shifting down to position 3. Result: [0, 2, 128, 64]. Score gain: 64.\n- Other columns have no merges. Tiles shift down but remain unmerged.\n- Resulting board:\n  - Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 2]\n  - Row 1: [2, 32, 64, 8]\n  - Row 2: [128, 2, 4, 4]\n  - Row 3: [64, 8, 64, 256]\n- While 256 stays in the corner, Row 2 has adjacent 4s (no merge in a vertical swipe) and less strategic empty space (Row 0).\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP swipe provides a score gain of 64, keeps 256 in the strategic bottom-right corner, and creates empty space in Row 3 for future moves. This is more favorable than DOWN, which offers the same score but less optimal tile positioning.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to identify merges and strategic tile placement.\n\n### LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0 (2|32|64|2):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 1 (128|2|4|8):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 2 (64|8|64|4):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 3 (4|0|0|256):** Tiles shift left to 4|256|0|0; no merges.  \n**Result:** No merges.  \n\n### RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0 (2|32|64|2):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 1 (128|2|4|8):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 2 (64|8|64|4):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 3 (4|0|0|256):** Tiles shift right to 0|0|4|256; no merges.  \n**Result:** No merges.  \n\n### UP Swipe:\n- **Column 0 (2|128|64|4):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.\n- **Column 1 (32|2|8|0):** Tiles shift up to 32|2|8|0; no merges.\n- **Column 2 (64|4|64|0):** Non-zero tiles [64, 4, 64] shift up to [64, 64, 4, 0]. The two 64s merge into 128, resulting in [128, 4, 0, 0].  \n  **Merge Score:** 128.  \n- **Column 3 (2|8|4|256):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n**Result:** Merges 64 + 64 → 128, gaining 128 score.  \n\n### DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 0 (2|128|64|4):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.\n- **Column 1 (32|2|8|0):** Tiles shift down to 0|32|2|8; no merges.\n- **Column 2 (64|4|64|0):** Tiles shift down to 0|64|4|64; no merges.\n- **Column 3 (2|8|4|256):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n**Result:** No merges.  \n\nThe UP swipe is the only direction that triggers a merge (64 + 64 → 128), providing a significant score boost. This move also aligns with strategic play by consolidating tiles upward, supporting larger tile growth.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN), focusing on merges, tile positioning, and strategic alignment of large tiles (especially the 256 in the bottom-right corner).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 32 | 64 | 2\nRow 1: 128 | 2 | 4 | 8\nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 64 | 4\nRow 3: 4 | 8 | 0 | 256\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - No merges occur. Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal numbers are present. The only change is in Row 3: `4 | 8 | 256 | 0` (256 moves left from column 3 to 2).  \n   - No score gain, and 256 is moved away from the corner (suboptimal).  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - No merges occur. Tiles shift right, with Row 3 becoming `0 | 4 | 8 | 256` (256 stays in the bottom-right corner).  \n   - No score gain, but 256 remains in the corner. However, no merges limit future opportunities.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Merges the two 8s in Column 1 (Row 2 and Row 3) into 16, adding 16 points. Column 1 becomes `32 | 2 | 16 | 0`.  \n   - Creates one new empty tile (Row 3, Column 1). The 16 is placed in Row 2, Column 1, which does not strategically align with the 256 in the corner.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Merges the two 8s in Column 1 (Row 2 and Row 3) into 16, adding 16 points. Column 1 becomes `0 | 32 | 2 | 16`.  \n   - Creates one new empty tile (Row 0, Column 1). The 16 is placed in Row 3, Column 1 (same row as 256 in the bottom-right corner), preserving the corner for 256.  \n   - Additionally, Row 2 becomes `64 | 2 | 64 | 4` after the move, leaving a 0 in Row 0, Column 1. This positions the two 64s in Row 2 (Columns 0 and 2) with a gap, setting up a potential future merge (e.g., shifting left in the next move could align and merge them into 128).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving **DOWN** merges the 8s for immediate points, keeps 256 in the corner, and sets up future merges for the 64s in Row 2. This is the most strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 128 | 0 | 2  \nRow 1: 128 | 32 | 64 | 8  \nRow 2: 64 | 2 | 4 | 4  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 256  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left to `[2, 128, 2, 0]` (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles are all unique, so no merges (`[128, 32, 64, 8]`).  \n- **Row 2**: The two `4`s merge into `8`, resulting in `[64, 2, 8, 0]` (score +8).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles are all unique, so no merges (`[4, 16, 64, 256]`).  \n- **Result**: Only one merge (row 2) with no strategic advantage for future moves.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right to `[0, 2, 128, 2]` (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles are all unique, so no merges (`[128, 32, 64, 8]`).  \n- **Row 2**: The two `4`s merge into `8`, resulting in `[64, 2, 0, 8]` (score +8).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles are all unique, so no merges (`[4, 16, 64, 256]`).  \n- **Key Strategic Advantage**: After merging the `4`s in row 2, the resulting `8` moves to column 3. This aligns with the `8` in row 1, column 3 (from the original board). If a subsequent UP swipe is made, these two `8`s can merge into `16`, creating a future scoring opportunity.  \n\n#### **UP**:\n- Columns are processed by shifting tiles upward. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column, so no merges occur. The board remains mostly unchanged, with minimal tile movement.  \n\n#### **DOWN**:\n- Columns are processed by shifting tiles downward. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column, so no merges occur. The board remains mostly unchanged, with minimal tile movement.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile both LEFT and RIGHT merge the `4`s in row 2 (scoring +8), RIGHT is strategically better. It positions the merged `8` in column 3, row 2, adjacent to the `8` in column 3, row 1. This sets up a potential future merge (via UP) to create a `16`, enhancing long-term scoring potential. UP and DOWN offer no merges and no strategic benefits.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: [4, 2, 128, 2] (no merges, all distinct).  \n- **Row 1**: [128, 32, 64, 8] (no merges, all distinct).  \n- **Row 2**: [0, 64, 2, 8] (shifts left to [64, 2, 8, 0], no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [4, 16, 64, 256] (no merges, all distinct).  \n**Result**: No merges. Poor choice.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: [4, 2, 128, 2] (no merges, all distinct).  \n- **Row 1**: [128, 32, 64, 8] (no merges, all distinct).  \n- **Row 2**: [0, 64, 2, 8] (shifts right to [0, 8, 2, 64], no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [4, 16, 64, 256] (no merges, all distinct).  \n**Result**: No merges. Poor choice.\n\n### UP Move:\nTiles shift upward, merging in columns:  \n- **Column 0**: [4, 128, 0, 4] (no merges, distinct values).  \n- **Column 1**: [2, 32, 64, 16] (no merges, distinct values).  \n- **Column 2**: [128, 64, 2, 64] (non-zero tiles [128, 64, 2, 64] shift up, merging the two 64s into 128. Score: +128).  \n- **Column 3**: [2, 8, 8, 256] (non-zero tiles [2, 8, 8, 256] shift up, merging the two 8s into 16. Score: +16).  \n**Result**: Merges in Column 2 and Column 3, total score +144. Strategic, as larger tiles (e.g., 256) remain in the corner.\n\n### DOWN Move:\nTiles shift downward, merging in columns:  \n- **Column 0**: [4, 128, 0, 4] (no merges, distinct values).  \n- **Column 1**: [2, 32, 64, 16] (no merges, distinct values).  \n- **Column 2**: [128, 64, 2, 64] (no merges, 64s are not adjacent after shifting down).  \n- **Column 3**: [2, 8, 8, 256] (merges two 8s into 16. Score: +16).  \n**Result**: Only one merge, score +16. Less optimal than UP.\n\nThe UP move provides the highest score (144) and strategically maintains larger tiles in corners. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board and possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to identify merges and strategic alignment of tiles. The current game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 2 | 128 | 2\nRow 1: 128 | 32 | 64 | 16\nRow 2: 4 | 64 | 2 | 256\nRow 3: 0 | 16 | 64 | 32\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur.  \n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   Tiles shift up, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. No merges occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   Tiles shift down. Key observation: In **Column 2** (third column), the tiles are `[128, 64, 2, 64]` (top to bottom). When shifting down:  \n   - The `64` in Row 1 (Column 2) moves down to Row 2 (pushing the `2` in Row 2 up to Row 1).  \n   - The `64` in Row 3 (Column 2) remains in Row 3.  \n   - After shifting, Column 2 becomes `[128, 2, 64, 64]` (Row 0 to Row 3).  \n   - The two `64`s in Rows 2 and 3 of Column 2 are now adjacent and merge into `128`, adding 128 to the score.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN move triggers a merge of two `64` tiles into `128`, which is the only valid merge possible. This move also aligns with strategic goals (e.g., consolidating larger tiles).  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or shifts in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). A valid move requires either merging adjacent equal tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces. The current grid has no empty tiles (all values are non-zero), so we focus on potential merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2  \nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   All rows are already left-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 0: [8, 2, 128, 2] has no duplicates to merge, and no empty spaces to shift into. No merges or shifts occur.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   All rows are already right-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 0: [8, 2, 128, 2] has no duplicates to merge, and no empty spaces to shift into. No merges or shifts occur.  \n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   All columns are already top-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Column 0: [8, 4, 128, 4] has no duplicates to merge, and no empty spaces to shift into. No merges or shifts occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   All columns are already bottom-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Column 0: [8, 4, 128, 4] has no duplicates to merge, and no empty spaces to shift into. No merges or shifts occur.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied with no empty tiles, and there are no adjacent equal tiles in any row or column. Thus, no valid moves (merges or shifts) are possible in any direction. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, an arbitrary choice is made.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement. The current board has no empty tiles (all tiles are non-zero), and we check for adjacent tiles with the same value that could merge when swiped.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2  \nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No Empty Tiles**: All 16 tiles are non-zero, so the grid is full.\n- **No Adjacent Merges**: There are no horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles with the same value. For example:\n  - Row 0: 8, 2, 128, 2 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 1: 4, 32, 64, 16 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 2: 128, 64, 2, 256 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 3: 4, 16, 64, 32 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Columns: All columns also lack adjacent duplicates (e.g., column 0: 8, 4, 128, 4; column 2: 128, 64, 2, 64).\n\n### Valid Moves:\nA valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, **no valid moves exist**. However, the problem specifies choosing one of LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Given the constraints, any direction would result in no merges or shifts (as the grid is full), but the game would end due to no valid moves.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and the goal of merging tiles to maximize score and future potential.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current 4x4 grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2\nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16\nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256\nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32\n```\n\n### Direction Evaluation:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Each row is processed to shift tiles left. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any row, so no merges occur. No score gain.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Each row is processed to shift tiles right. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any row (after reversing and processing), so no merges occur. No score gain.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Each column is processed to shift tiles upward. Key analysis:  \n   - **Column 2**: Original tiles: [128 (row0), 64 (row1), 2 (row2), 64 (row3)].  \n     When shifting up, the 64 in row3 moves up past the 2 in row2, aligning with the 64 in row1. This creates adjacent 64s, which merge into 128. Score gain: 128.  \n   Other columns have no merges. UP is the only direction with a valid merge.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Each column is processed to shift tiles downward. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column (after reversing and processing), so no merges occur. No score gain.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only direction with a valid merge (and score gain) is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|2|128|2\nRow 1: 4|32|64|16\nRow 2: 128|64|2|256\nRow 3: 4|16|64|32\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All rows have distinct non-zero tiles with no adjacent duplicates. No merges or movement occur. **Invalid**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   All rows have distinct non-zero tiles with no adjacent duplicates. No merges or movement occur. **Invalid**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles `8, 4, 128, 4` shift up. The two `4`s (rows 1 and 3) merge into `8` (score +8).  \n   - **Column 2**: Tiles `128, 64, 2, 64` shift up. The two `64`s (rows 1 and 3) merge into `128` (score +128).  \n   Other columns have no merges. Total score: 136.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles `8, 4, 128, 4` shift down. The two `4`s (rows 2 and 3) merge into `8` (score +8).  \n   - **Column 2**: Tiles `128, 64, 2, 64` shift down. The two `64`s (rows 2 and 3) merge into `128` (score +128).  \n   Other columns have no merges. Total score: 136.  \n\n### Key Consideration:\nBoth UP and DOWN yield the same score, but **DOWN** is preferred. The 256 tile (largest tile) is in the southeast corner (row 2, column 3). Moving DOWN keeps larger tiles (e.g., 128s) in the lower half of the grid, aligning with the strategy of consolidating larger tiles in corners for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile arrangement.

A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same value or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend solely on merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n2. **Horizontal Merges (LEFT\/RIGHT)**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles are [8, 2, 128, 2]. No adjacent duplicates.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles are [4, 32, 64, 16]. No adjacent duplicates.  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles are [128, 64, 2, 256]. No adjacent duplicates.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles are [4, 16, 64, 32]. No adjacent duplicates.  \n   No horizontal merges are possible for LEFT or RIGHT moves.\n\n3. **Vertical Merges (UP\/DOWN)**:  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles are [8, 4, 128, 4].

No adjacent duplicates.  \n   - **Column 3**: Tiles are [2, 16, 256, 32]. No adjacent duplicates.  \n   No vertical merges are possible for UP or DOWN moves.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent tiles of the same value exist in any direction. This means there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and no direction offers a valid merge, the choice is arbitrary. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

No adjacent duplicates exist in any column after shifting tiles upward. No merges occur. No score gain.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Columns are checked for vertical merges. Focus on **Column 2** (values: 128, 64, 2, 64, top to bottom). When swiping down:  \n   - Tiles shift toward the bottom. The 64 in Row 1 (Column 2) moves down past the 2 in Row 2 (Column 2) to Row 2.

The current grid has no empty tiles (all values are non-zero), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2  \nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Each row is checked for adjacent duplicates. All rows have distinct values (no two adjacent tiles are the same). Since there are no empty spaces, tiles cannot shift left. No merges or movement occur. **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Similar to LEFT, all rows have distinct values with no adjacent duplicates. No empty spaces prevent tiles from shifting right. No merges or movement occur. **Invalid move**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Columns are checked for adjacent duplicates. All columns have distinct values (no two adjacent tiles in the same column are the same). No empty spaces prevent tiles from shifting up. No merges or movement occur. **Invalid move**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Columns are checked for adjacent duplicates. All columns have distinct values (no two adjacent tiles in the same column are the same). No empty spaces prevent tiles from shifting down. No merges or movement occur. **Invalid move**.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves are invalid because there are no adjacent tiles to merge and no empty spaces to shift into. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, any direction is technically invalid, but we arbitrarily choose **LEFT** as the answer.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to see which allows merging tiles and maximizes score.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2  \nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- All rows have distinct adjacent tiles (no merges). Tiles are already shifted left, so no changes.  \n**Result**: No merges or score gain.  \n\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- All rows have distinct adjacent tiles (no merges). Tiles are already shifted right, so no changes.  \n**Result**: No merges or score gain.  \n\n\n### UP Move:\n- Columns are processed by shifting tiles upward and merging adjacent duplicates:  \n  - **Column 0**: [8, 4, 128, 4] → No merges (all distinct).  \n  - **Column 1**: [2, 32, 64, 16] → No merges (all distinct).  \n  - **Column 2**: [128, 64, 2, 64] → After shifting up, the two 64s (originally in Row 1 and Row 3) become adjacent and merge into 128. Score gain: 128.  \n  - **Column 3**: [2, 16, 256, 32] → No merges (all distinct).  \n**Result**: Merges occur in Column 2, yielding 128 score.  \n\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- Columns are processed by shifting tiles downward and merging adjacent duplicates:  \n  - All columns have distinct adjacent tiles (no merges). Tiles remain unchanged.  \n**Result**: No merges or score gain.  \n\n\nThe only move with a valid merge (and score gain) is **UP**.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging potential:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2  \nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \nAll tiles in each row are distinct (no adjacent duplicates). Shifting left would not merge any tiles, resulting in no score gain.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nSimilarly, all tiles in each row are distinct. Shifting right would not merge any tiles, resulting in no score gain.  \n\n#### **UP**  \nColumns are processed top-to-bottom. Key observation:  \n- **Column 2** (values: 128, 64, 2, 64). When shifting up, the bottom 64 (row 3) moves upward past the 2 (row 2), aligning with the 64 (row 1). These two 64s merge into 128, adding 128 to the score. The 2 (row 3) shifts up to fill the gap. This is a valid merge.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \nColumns are processed bottom-to-top. No adjacent duplicates in any column. Shifting down would not merge any tiles, resulting in no score gain.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe only move that triggers a merge (and score gain) is **UP**, as it merges the two 64s in Column 2.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile alignment. The current board has no empty tiles (all tiles are non-zero), so a valid move requires merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2  \nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipes**:  \n   - All rows are fully occupied with distinct values (no adjacent duplicates). Swiping left or right would not shift or merge any tiles, as there are no empty spaces to fill and no adjacent duplicates to merge. These moves are invalid.  \n\n2. **UP\/DOWN Swipes**:  \n   - All columns are fully occupied. Checking vertical adjacents:  \n     - Column 0: [8, 4, 128, 4] (no duplicates).  \n     - Column 1: [2, 32, 64, 16] (no duplicates).  \n     - Column 2: [128, 64, 2, 64] (64s at rows 1 and 3, separated by 2).  \n     - Column 3: [2, 16, 256, 32] (no duplicates).  \n\n   - No vertical adjacent duplicates exist. Swiping up or down would not merge any tiles, as there are no empty spaces to shift into and no adjacent duplicates to merge. These moves are also invalid.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent tiles (horizontal or vertical) have the same value. By the rules, there are no valid moves left.

LEFT Swipe:\n- All rows are checked for adjacent equal tiles. None of the rows (8,2,128,2; 4,32,64,16; 128,64,2,256; 4,16,64,32) have adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur.\n\n#### 2. RIGHT Swipe:\n- All rows are checked for adjacent equal tiles when shifted right. None of the rows (8,2,128,2; 4,32,64,16; 128,64,2,256; 4,16,64,32) have adjacent equal tiles after shifting. No merges occur.\n\n#### 3. UP Swipe:\n- Columns are checked for adjacent equal tiles when shifted up. Key column analysis:\n  - **Column 2** (values: 128, 64, 2, 64):  \n    When shifted up, the 64 in Row 1 and the 64 in Row 3 move upward. After shifting, Row 1 and Row 2 in Column 2 become adjacent 64s, which merge into 128. This results in a valid merge with a score of 128.\n\n#### 4. DOWN Swipe:\n- Columns are checked for adjacent equal tiles when shifted down. None of the columns (8,4,128,4; 2,32,64,16; 128,64,2,64; 2,16,256,32) have adjacent equal tiles after shifting. No merges occur.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only valid merge occurs when swiping UP, where two 64s in Column 2 merge into 128. This move maximizes the score gain.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or movements in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

All tiles in every row are distinct (no adjacent duplicates). No merges or movement occur.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Each row is processed right to left. All tiles in every row are distinct (no adjacent duplicates). No merges or movement occur.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Each column is processed top to bottom. All tiles in every column are distinct (no adjacent duplicates). No merges or movement occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Each column is processed bottom to top. All tiles in every column are distinct (no adjacent duplicates). No merges or movement occur.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied with no adjacent tiles of the same number, meaning no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any direction is technically a forced choice. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. The goal is to identify a valid move where tiles can merge or shift into empty spaces. The current grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles after shifting.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2\nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16\nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256\nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: All rows have distinct tiles with no adjacent duplicates. Shifting left would not merge any tiles, and no empty spaces exist to shift into. **Invalid**.\n2. **RIGHT**: Similarly, all rows have distinct tiles with no adjacent duplicates. Shifting right would not merge any tiles, and no empty spaces exist to shift into. **Invalid**.\n3. **UP**: All columns have distinct tiles with no adjacent duplicates. Shifting up would not merge any tiles, and no empty spaces exist to shift into. **Invalid**.\n4. **DOWN**: Column 2 (values: 128, 64, 2, 64) has two 64s in rows 1 and 3. When shifting down:\n   - The 64 in row 1 (column 2) shifts down past the 2 in row 2 (column 2) to row 3 (column 2), where it merges with the 64 in row 3 (column 2).\n   - This merge creates a new 128 tile in row 3 (column 2), with row 1 (column 2) becoming empty (0). The 2 in row 2 (column 2) shifts up to row 2 (column 2).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is the only valid move, as it merges the two 64s in column 2 into a 128, creating a new tile and scoring 128 points.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules, focusing on merging tiles and strategic placement of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2  \nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles**: All tiles are non-zero (no 0s), so valid moves require adjacent equal tiles (since there are no empty spaces to shift into).  \n- **No adjacent equal tiles**: Checking all rows and columns, there are no adjacent tiles with the same value. For example:  \n  - Rows: All tiles in each row are distinct (e.g., Row 0: 8, 2, 128, 2; no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Columns: All tiles in each column are distinct (e.g., Column 0: 8, 4, 128, 4; no adjacent duplicates).  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\nSince there are no empty tiles and no adjacent equal tiles, **no move will result in merging tiles**. However, the game requires choosing a direction. Strategically, the goal is to position larger tiles (e.g., 256, 128) in corners to facilitate future merges. The largest tile (256) is already in the bottom-right corner (Row 2, Column 3). Swiping DOWN could help maintain or reinforce this corner focus, even if no merges occur immediately.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning.

However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of strategic advantage, any direction is functionally equivalent, but we choose LEFT as a default.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or shifts in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

Swiping down would not merge tiles or shift them (grid remains unchanged).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied, and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number. Thus, no valid moves exist to merge or shift tiles. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Since all directions are equally invalid, any direction can be chosen.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging potential:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2  \nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Each row is processed leftward. All tiles in every row are distinct (no adjacent duplicates), so no merges occur. No score gain.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Each row is processed rightward. Similarly, all tiles in every row are distinct, so no merges occur. No score gain.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Each column is processed upward. All columns have distinct tiles (no adjacent duplicates when shifted up), so no merges occur. No score gain.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Each column is processed downward. Focusing on **Column 2** (values: 128, 64, 2, 64):  \n   - When moving down, tiles shift toward the bottom. The 64 in Row 1 (value 64) and the 64 in Row 3 (value 64) are separated by a 2 in Row 2.  \n   - Shifting down pushes the 64 from Row 1 past the 2 in Row 2 to Row 2, and the 2 in Row 2 shifts to Row 3. This positions the two 64s (now in Row 2 and Row 3) adjacently.  \n   - These two 64s merge into a 128, adding 128 to the score.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving **DOWN** is the only direction that enables a merge (64 + 64 → 128), increasing the score and strategically positioning larger tiles. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement.

No merges occur.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal values exist in any row. No merges occur.  \n3. **UP**: Tiles shift up, but no adjacent equal values exist in any column. No merges occur.  \n4. **DOWN**: Tiles shift down. While the grid is full, we re-evaluate column 2 (values: 128, 64, 2, 64). Swiping down shifts the 64 in row 1 (column 2) toward the bottom, pushing the 2 in row 2 (column 2) upward. This aligns the 64 in row 1 (column 2) with the 64 in row 3 (column 2) after shifting, allowing them to merge into 128. This merge is the only viable opportunity to combine tiles and increase the score.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the optimal move, as it enables merging the 64s in column 2.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and valid moves. The grid is fully occupied (no 0s), so a valid move requires adjacent tiles of the same value to merge.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2  \nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no 0s).  \n- **No adjacent duplicates**: In all rows and columns, no two adjacent tiles have the same value. For example:  \n  - Row 0: 8, 2, 128, 2 (2s are separated by 128, not adjacent).  \n  - Row 1: 4, 32, 64, 16 (all unique).  \n  - Row 2: 128, 64, 2, 256 (all unique).  \n  - Row 3: 4, 16, 64, 32 (all unique).  \n  - Columns similarly have no adjacent duplicates (e.g., column 0: 8, 4, 128, 4; 4s are separated by 128).  \n\n### Valid Moves Check:\nA valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles or moving into an empty space. Since there are no empty spaces, the only valid moves would involve merging adjacent duplicates. However, no such duplicates exist in any direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are invalid because there are no adjacent duplicates to merge and no empty spaces to shift tiles into. The game would end immediately after this move due to no valid moves remaining. Despite this, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for valid moves (merging adjacent tiles or shifting into empty spaces). The current board has no empty tiles (all cells are non-zero), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent equal tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2  \nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**: Tiles shift left. All rows have distinct non-zero tiles with no adjacent duplicates. No merges or shifts occur.  \n2. **RIGHT Swipe**: Tiles shift right. All rows have distinct non-zero tiles with no adjacent duplicates. No merges or shifts occur.  \n3. **UP Swipe**: Tiles shift up. All columns have distinct non-zero tiles with no adjacent duplicates. No merges or shifts occur.  \n4. **DOWN Swipe**: Tiles shift down. All columns have distinct non-zero tiles with no adjacent duplicates. No merges or shifts occur.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent tiles are equal. Thus, no valid moves exist. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Since all moves are invalid, any direction is technically acceptable, but based on the rules, the game would end.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile arrangement. The grid has no empty tiles (all values are non-zero), so valid moves must involve merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2  \nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All rows are full (no empty spaces), and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. Shifting left would not merge any tiles, as tiles cannot move into empty spaces or merge with non-adjacent equals. No valid merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Similar to LEFT, all rows are full, and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. Shifting right would not merge any tiles, as tiles cannot move into empty spaces or merge with non-adjacent equals. No valid merges.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   All columns are full (no empty spaces), and no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. Shifting up would not merge any tiles, as tiles cannot move into empty spaces or merge with non-adjacent equals. No valid merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   All columns are full, but column 2 (third column) has two 64s at positions (row1, col2) and (row3, col2), separated by a 2 (row2, col2). While these 64s are not adjacent, strategic movement could position them to merge. However, since the grid is full, tiles cannot shift past non-zero tiles. Despite this, DOWN is chosen as the most strategic direction to potentially align larger tiles (e.g., 256 in row2, col3) in a corner for future merges.  \n\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and grid dynamics. The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2\nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16\nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256\nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Grid is Full**: There are no empty tiles (0s), so movement requires merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **No Adjacent Duplicates**: Checking all horizontal and vertical adjacent tiles confirms no two adjacent tiles have the same value. For example:\n  - Row 0: 8, 2, 128, 2 (no duplicates).\n  - Row 1: 4, 32, 64, 16 (no duplicates).\n  - Row 2: 128, 64, 2, 256 (no duplicates).\n  - Row 3: 4, 16, 64, 32 (no duplicates).\n  - Columns (vertical adjacents) also have no duplicates.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, none of these moves will cause tiles to shift or merge. All moves result in no change to the board.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves are invalid under the rules (no merges or empty spaces to shift into). However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, any direction is technically acceptable, but we choose **DOWN** as a default.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile alignment, and strategic positioning of large tiles. The current grid is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 8|2|128|2\nRow 1: 4|32|64|16\nRow 2: 128|64|2|256\nRow 3: 4|16|64|32\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No Empty Tiles**: The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **Adjacent Tiles**: All horizontally and vertically adjacent tiles are distinct. For example:\n  - Rows: No adjacent duplicates (e.g., Row 0: 8, 2, 128, 2 has 2s separated by 128; other rows have all unique values).\n  - Columns: No adjacent duplicates (e.g., Column 2 has 64s in Row 1 and Row 3, but they are separated by 2; other columns have unique values).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Since all rows are full and have no adjacent duplicates, tiles cannot shift or merge. The grid remains unchanged. No score is gained, and no new opportunities for merging are created.\n\n2. **UP\/DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Similarly, all columns are full and have no adjacent duplicates. Tiles cannot shift or merge. The grid remains unchanged. No score is gained, and no new opportunities for merging are created.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nWhile all moves result in no immediate merges or shifts, the game continues until epoch 100. To maintain flexibility for future moves (e.g., new tiles spawning as 2 or 4), it is strategic to keep larger tiles in a corner. The largest tile (256) is in the bottom-right corner (Row 2, Column 3). Choosing **DOWN** keeps this tile in place and avoids disrupting the alignment of other tiles, preserving potential for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) by evaluating potential tile merges and score gains. The game board is:\n\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2  \nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. Shifting left would not merge any tiles. Score: 0.  \n2. **RIGHT**: All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. Shifting right would not merge any tiles. Score: 0.  \n3. **DOWN**: All columns have no adjacent equal tiles (since all tiles are non-zero and no duplicates in columns). Shifting down would not merge any tiles. Score: 0.  \n4. **UP**: Check columns for merges:  \n   - **Column 2** (values: 128, 64, 2, 64): When shifting up, the 64 in row 3 (bottom) moves up past the 2 in row 2, resulting in [128, 64, 64, 2]. The two 64s in rows 1 and 2 merge into 128, adding 128 to the score.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP merges two 64s in column 2, yielding a score of 128. This is the only valid merge possible among the directions.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merges and movement potential. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2\nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16\nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256\nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles (0s):** All tiles are occupied, so movement requires merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **No adjacent equal tiles:** Checking all rows and columns horizontally and vertically, there are no adjacent tiles with the same value. For example:\n  - Row 0: 8, 2, 128, 2 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 1: 4, 32, 64, 16 (all distinct).\n  - Row 2: 128, 64, 2, 256 (all distinct).\n  - Row 3: 4, 16, 64, 32 (all distinct).\n  - Columns similarly have no adjacent duplicates (e.g., column 2: 128, 64, 2, 64—64s are not adjacent).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT:** Since all rows are full and no adjacent tiles merge, swiping left or right will not change the board.\n- **UP\/DOWN:** All columns are full, and no adjacent tiles merge, so swiping up or down also leaves the board unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNo valid moves exist (no merges possible and no empty spaces to shift tiles). However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid moves, any direction is technically invalid, but we arbitrarily choose LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to identify merges or valid moves. The grid is full (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles to merge. \n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2  \nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: All rows have distinct adjacent tiles. No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift left (grid is full).  \n2. **RIGHT**: Similarly, all rows have distinct adjacent tiles. No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift right (grid is full).  \n3. **UP**: Checking columns for vertical merges:  \n   - Column 0: [8, 4, 128, 4] (no adjacent duplicates).  \n   - Column 1: [2, 32, 64, 16] (no adjacent duplicates).  \n   - Column 2: [128, 64, 2, 64] (64s in rows 1 and 3 are non-adjacent).  \n   - Column 3: [2, 16, 256, 32] (no adjacent duplicates).  \n   No vertical merges occur, and tiles cannot shift up (grid is full).  \n4. **DOWN**: Checking columns for vertical merges:  \n   - Column 0: [8, 4, 128, 4] (no adjacent duplicates).  \n   - Column 1: [2, 32, 64, 16] (no adjacent duplicates).  \n   - Column 2: [128, 64, 2, 64] (64s in rows 1 and 3 are non-adjacent).  \n   - Column 3: [2, 16, 256, 32] (no adjacent duplicates).  \n   No vertical merges occur, and tiles cannot shift down (grid is full).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent tiles to merge, so no moves result in merges. However, the problem requires selecting one of the directions. Given the epoch (96) and the need to proceed, any direction is valid. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges and strategic positioning. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 8|2|128|2  \nRow 1: 4|32|64|16  \nRow 2: 128|64|2|256  \nRow 3: 4|16|64|32  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles (0s):** The grid is fully occupied, so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **Adjacent tiles check:** No horizontally adjacent tiles (same row) have matching values. Vertically (same column), the only potential candidates are:\n  - Column 0: 4 (row 1) and 4 (row 3), separated by 128 (row 2).\n  - Column 2: 64 (row 1) and 64 (row 3), separated by 2 (row 2).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipes:**  \n   For all rows, tiles are distinct and cannot merge. Swiping left or right would not change the grid (no merges, no empty spaces to shift into).\n\n2. **UP Swipe:**  \n   Columns are processed upward. No vertically adjacent tiles merge, as the 4s and 64s are separated by different values. The grid remains unchanged.\n\n3. **DOWN Swipe:**  \n   Columns are processed downward. While the 4s in column 0 and 64s in column 2 are initially separated, shifting tiles downward could align them. For example, in column 2:\n   - Original: [128 (row 0), 64 (row 1), 2 (row 2), 64 (row 3)]  \n   - Swiping down shifts 128 upward, 64 (row 1) downward past 2 (row 2), and 64 (row 3) remains at the bottom. This could position 64 (row 1) and 64 (row 3) adjacently, enabling a merge into 128 (scoring 128). While exact alignment is complex, this direction has the highest potential for future merges given the remaining epochs (97\/100).\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the most strategic move, as it maximizes the potential for merging larger tiles in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) in the 4x4 grid. The goal is to maximize the score by merging tiles, especially given the current epoch (98), which allows only 2 more moves.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2\nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16\nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256\nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. Tiles cannot merge, and no score is gained.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   All rows are already right-aligned with no empty spaces. No tiles merge, and no score is gained.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Columns are checked for upward movement. No adjacent equal tiles are found in any column, so no merges occur. No score is gained.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Columns are checked for downward movement. Key observation in **Column 2** (values: 128, 64, 2, 64):  \n   - Tiles shift down. The 64 in Row 1 (64) and 64 in Row 3 (64) become adjacent after shifting (Row 2 and Row 3).  \n   - These two 64s merge into a 128, adding 128 to the score.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly the DOWN swipe results in a valid merge (64 + 64 = 128), maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid to check for valid moves (merges or empty spaces to shift tiles) in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is fully occupied (no 0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value in the direction of the swipe.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2  \nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32  \n\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: All rows are fully occupied with no adjacent equal tiles. Shifting left would not merge any tiles or create movement.  \n   - Example: Row 0 (8, 2, 128, 2) has no adjacent duplicates; shifting left leaves it unchanged.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**: Similarly, all rows are full with no adjacent equal tiles. Shifting right would not merge or move tiles.  \n   - Example: Row 3 (4, 16, 64, 32) has no adjacent duplicates; shifting right leaves it unchanged.  \n\n3. **UP**: All columns are full with no adjacent equal tiles. Shifting up would not merge or move tiles.  \n   - Example: Column 0 (8, 4, 128, 4) has no adjacent duplicates; shifting up leaves it unchanged.  \n\n4. **DOWN**: All columns are full with no adjacent equal tiles. Shifting down would not merge or move tiles.  \n   - Example: Column 2 (128, 64, 2, 64) has no adjacent duplicates; shifting down leaves it unchanged.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied, and no adjacent tiles in any direction are equal. Thus, no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, an arbitrary choice is made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move for the given 4x4 grid at epoch 100, we analyze the validity of each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or moving tiles into empty spaces. \n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves depend solely on the presence of adjacent tiles that can merge when shifted. The current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 2\nRow 1: 4 | 32 | 64 | 16\nRow 2: 128 | 64 | 2 | 256\nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 32\n```\n\n### Direction Validity Check:\n- **LEFT**: Each row is checked for merges. All rows have distinct numbers with no adjacent duplicates. Shifting left does not cause any merges or movement (grid remains unchanged).  \n- **RIGHT**: Similarly, all rows have distinct numbers. Shifting right does not cause merges or movement (grid remains unchanged).  \n- **UP**: Each column is checked for merges. Columns have no adjacent duplicates (e.g., column 0: 8, 4, 128, 4; column 2: 128, 64, 2, 64). Shifting up does not cause merges or movement.  \n- **DOWN**: Columns also have no adjacent duplicates. Shifting down does not cause merges or movement.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nNo direction results in valid merges or movement since the grid is full with no adjacent duplicates. However, since the game ends after the 100th epoch, any direction is technically acceptable as the final move. \n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n8|2|128|2\n4|32|64|16\n128|64|2|256\n4|16|64|32\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The two adjacent 2s merge into 4, resulting in [4,0,0,0]. Score += 4.  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles [2 (Row 0), 0, 0, 0] shift up to [2,0,0,0]. No merges.  \n- Result: The 4 is in (0,2) (not a corner), and the 2 is in (0,3). This is suboptimal as larger tiles are not in corners.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles [2 (Row 0), 2 (Row 1), 0, 0] shift down to [0,0,2,2]. The two adjacent 2s merge into 4, resulting in [0,0,0,4]. Score += 4.  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles [2 (Row 0), 0, 0, 0] shift down to [0,0,0,2]. No merges.  \n- Result: The 4 is in (3,2) (not a corner), and the 2 is in (3,3). This is also suboptimal.  \n\n\n### Key Strategy:  \nThe goal is to keep larger tiles in corners. Both LEFT and RIGHT place the merged 4 in a corner (top-left and top-right, respectively). However, LEFT positions the 4 in the top-left corner (0,0) with the 2 from Row 1 in (1,0) (same column), creating a vertical alignment that facilitates future merges (e.g., moving up). This setup is more strategic for building higher tiles.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their effects on the current 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|2|0\nRow 1: 2|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift left. Non-zero tiles (4, 2) move to the left, resulting in `4|2|0|0` (no merging, as 4 ≠ 2).  \n   - Row 1: Tile (2) shifts left, resulting in `2|0|0|0`.  \n   - Rows 2 and 3: Remain unchanged (all zeros).  \n   - Outcome: Tiles consolidate to the left, reducing empty spaces and positioning smaller tiles (2s) to potentially merge in future moves. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (left) for better merging opportunities.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift right. Non-zero tiles (4, 2) move to the right, resulting in `0|0|4|2` (no merging).  \n   - Row 1: Tile (2) shifts right, resulting in `0|0|0|2`.  \n   - Rows 2 and 3: Remain unchanged.  \n   - Outcome: Tiles spread out to the right, making it harder to merge adjacent tiles in subsequent moves.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed upward. All non-zero tiles (4, 2 in column 0; 2 in column 2) are already in their highest possible positions.  \n   - Outcome: No tiles shift, so this is an invalid move (no change to the board).\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed downward. Tiles in column 0 (4, 2) shift to the bottom, resulting in `0|0|2|4` for column 0. Tile 2 in column 2 shifts to the bottom, resulting in `0|0|0|2` for column 2.  \n   - Outcome: Tiles spread to the bottom rows, leaving empty spaces above but reducing adjacency for potential merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe consolidates tiles to the left, creating better conditions for future merges (e.g., aligning 2s in row 1 or 0 for potential merging). This is the most strategic move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|2|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles [4, 2, 0, 0] shift left to [4, 2, 0, 0] (no merging).  \n   - Row 1: Tiles [2, 0, 0, 2] shift left to [2, 2, 0, 0], then merge into [4, 0, 0, 0] (score +4).  \n   - Rows 2 and 3 remain empty.  \n   - Resulting board after LEFT:  \n     Row 0: 4|2|0|0  \n     Row 1: 4|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   - Larger tiles (4s) cluster in the top-left corner, which is strategic for future merges (e.g., potential 4+4 merge with an UP move later).  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles [4, 2, 0, 0] shift right to [0, 0, 4, 2] (no merging).  \n   - Row 1: Tiles [2, 0, 0, 2] shift right to [0, 0, 2, 2], then merge into [0, 0, 0, 4] (score +4).  \n   - Rows 2 and 3 remain empty.  \n   - Resulting board after RIGHT:  \n     Row 0: 0|0|4|2  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|4  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   - Larger tiles (4s) are spread on the right edge, which is less ideal for sustained merging compared to corner clustering.  \n\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns shift upward, but no merges occur (e.g., column 0: [4, 2, 0, 0] → [4, 2, 0, 0]; column 3: [0, 2, 0, 0] → [2, 0, 0, 0]).  \n   - No score gain, and tiles are scattered without strategic clustering.  \n\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns shift downward, but no merges occur (e.g., column 0: [4, 2, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 4, 2]; column 3: [0, 2, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 2]).  \n   - No score gain, and tiles are spread across the bottom row with no clear merging potential.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield a merge (score +4), but LEFT strategically clusters larger tiles in the top-left corner, facilitating future merges (e.g., 4+4 with an UP move). RIGHT scatters tiles on the right edge, reducing merging potential. Thus, LEFT is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to maximize score and strategically position larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|2|2|0  \nRow 1: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The 2s in columns 1 and 2 merge into 4 (score +4). Row 0 becomes `4|4|0|0`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left, no merging. Row 1 remains `4|0|0|0`.  \n- Rows 2 and 3: No change.  \n- Result: Board becomes `4|4|0|0`, `4|0|0|0`, `0|0|0|0`, `0|0|0|0`. Score gain: 4.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The 2s in columns 1 and 2 merge into 4 (score +4). Row 0 becomes `0|0|4|4`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right. The 4 moves to column 3. Row 1 becomes `0|0|0|4`.  \n- Rows 2 and 3: No change.  \n- Result: Board becomes `0|0|4|4`, `0|0|0|4`, `0|0|0|0`, `0|0|0|0`. Score gain: 4.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift up. The 4s in rows 0 and 1 merge into 8 (score +8). Column 0 becomes `8|0|0|0`.  \n- **Column 1**: The 2 in row 0 shifts up. Column 1 becomes `2|0|0|0`.  \n- **Column 2**: The 2 in row 0 shifts up. Column 2 becomes `2|0|0|0`.  \n- Column 3: No change.  \n- Result: Board becomes `8|2|2|0`, `0|0|0|0`, `0|0|0|0`, `0|0|0|0`. Score gain: 8.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift down. The 4s in rows 0 and 1 merge into 8 (score +8). Column 0 becomes `0|0|0|8`.  \n- **Column 1**: The 2 in row 0 shifts down to row 3. Column 1 becomes `0|0|0|2`.  \n- **Column 2**: The 2 in row 0 shifts down to row 3. Column 2 becomes `0|0|0|2`.  \n- Column 3: No change.  \n- Result: Board becomes `0|0|0|0`, `0|0|0|0`, `0|0|0|0`, `8|2|2|0`. Score gain: 8.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nBoth UP and DOWN yield the highest immediate score (8). However, UP positions the merged 8 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and leaves the 2s in row 0 adjacent, which can be merged in subsequent moves. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners and enabling future merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) on the given game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|2|2|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|2|0  \n\n\n### 1. Swipe LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two 2s in columns 1 and 2 merge into 4. Result: 8|4|0|0 (score +4).  \n- **Row 3**: The 2 in column 2 shifts to column 0. Result: 2|0|0|0.  \n- **Final Board After LEFT**:  \n  8|4|0|0  \n  2|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n- Larger tiles (8, 4, 2) are spread across rows 0 and 1, not concentrated in a corner.  \n\n\n### 2. Swipe RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two 2s in columns 1 and 2 merge into 4, and 8 shifts to column 2. Result: 0|0|8|4 (score +4).  \n- **Row 3**: The 2 in column 2 shifts to column 3. Result: 0|0|0|2.  \n- **Final Board After RIGHT**:  \n  0|0|8|4  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|2  \n- Larger tiles (8, 4, 2) are spread across row 0 and 3, with 8 in row 0, column 2—still not in a corner.  \n\n\n### 3. Swipe UP:\n- **Column 0**: 8 shifts to row 0 (no change).  \n- **Column 1**: 2 shifts to row 0 (no change).  \n- **Column 2**: The 2 in row 0 and 2 in row 3 merge into 4 (score +4). Result: 4|0|0|0.  \n- **Final Board After UP**:  \n  8|2|4|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n- Larger tiles (8, 2, 4) are all in row 0, leaving no clear corner for strategic merging.  \n\n\n### 4. Swipe DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: 8 shifts to row 3. Result: 0|0|0|8.  \n- **Column 1**: 2 shifts to row 3. Result: 0|0|0|2.  \n- **Column 2**: The 2 in row 0 and 2 in row 3 merge into 4 (score +4).

This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner to maximize future merging potential.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 2|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 8|2|4|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Tiles in each row shift left.  \n  - Row 0: All zeros (no change).  \n  - Row 1: `[2,0,0,0]` → remains `[2,0,0,0]` (no movement).  \n  - Row 2: All zeros (no change).  \n  - Row 3: `[8,2,4,0]` → remains `[8,2,4,0]` (no movement).  \n- No tiles move, so this is not a valid move.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Tiles in each row shift right.  \n  - Row 0: All zeros (no change).  \n  - Row 1: `[2,0,0,0]` → `[0,0,0,2]` (2 moves right).  \n  - Row 2: All zeros (no change).  \n  - Row 3: `[8,2,4,0]` → `[0,8,2,4]` (8, 2, 4 shift right).  \n- Valid move (tiles move into empty spaces), but no merging occurs.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles in each column shift down.  \n  - Column 0: `[0,2,0,8]` → `[0,0,2,8]` (2 moves down to row 2).  \n  - Column 1: `[0,0,0,2]` → remains `[0,0,0,2]` (2 already at bottom).  \n  - Column 2: `[0,0,0,4]` → remains `[0,0,0,4]` (4 already at bottom).  \n  - Column 3: All zeros (no change).  \n- Valid move (tiles move into empty spaces), but no merging occurs. The 8 (largest tile) stays in the bottom-left corner, but no strategic merging potential is created.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Tiles in each column shift up.  \n  - Column 0: `[0,2,0,8]` → `[2,8,0,0]` (2 moves up to row 0, 8 moves up to row 1).  \n  - Column 1: `[0,0,0,2]` → `[2,0,0,0]` (2 moves up to row 0).  \n  - Column 2: `[0,0,0,4]` → `[4,0,0,0]` (4 moves up to row 0).  \n  - Column 3: All zeros (no change).  \n- Resulting board after movement:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 2|2|4|0  \n  Row 1: 8|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n  ```  \n- This positions two 2s in Row 0 (adjacent horizontally), creating future merging potential. If a new tile (2 or 4) spawns in Row 0, subsequent swipes (e.g., LEFT) can merge these 2s into a 4, increasing the score and setting up for further merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nSwiping **UP** strategically positions smaller tiles (2s) in the top row, creating opportunities for merging in future moves. This aligns with the goal of combining tiles to maximize scores while avoiding displacement of the largest tile (8) from a corner.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the current game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 2|2|4|0  \nRow 1: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 4|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), then the merged 4 and original 4 merge into 8 (score +8). Result: 8|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 1**: 8|0|0|0 shifts left (no merges). Result: 8|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 2**: All zeros (no change).  \n- **Row 3**: 4|0|0|0 shifts left (no merges). Result: 4|0|0|0.  \n\nAfter LEFT swipe, the board becomes:  \nRow 0: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 4|0|0|0  \n\nThis clusters larger tiles (8, 8, 4) in the left column, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), then the merged 4 and original 4 merge into 8 (score +8). Result: 0|0|0|8.  \n- **Row 1**: 8|0|0|0 shifts right (no merges). Result: 0|0|0|8.  \n- **Row 2**: All zeros (no change).  \n- **Row 3**: 4|0|0|0 shifts right (no merges). Result: 0|0|0|4.  \n\nAfter RIGHT swipe, the board becomes:  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|4  \n\nWhile this clusters large tiles in the right column, the LEFT swipe better positions tiles for future merges (e.g., 8s in the same column can merge with an UP swipe).\n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- Columns shift up. No adjacent equal tiles merge. The board remains mostly unchanged (no score gain). This is inefficient.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- Columns shift down. No adjacent equal tiles merge. The board remains mostly unchanged (no score gain). This is also inefficient.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT is the best move, as it merges tiles for immediate score (12 points) and clusters large tiles in the left column, facilitating future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and the goal of merging tiles to maximize scores and strategic positioning.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\nRow 0: 4|4|0|0  \nRow 1: 8|2|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 4|0|0|0  \n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: The two adjacent 4s merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in `8|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles shift left (no merges) → `8|2|0|0`.  \n   - Row 2: No change (all zeros).  \n   - Row 3: Tiles shift left (no merges) → `4|0|0|0`.  \n   - Resulting board after LEFT:  \n     8|0|0|0  \n     8|2|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     4|0|0|0  \n   - This move merges tiles, gains 8 points, and positions larger tiles (8, 8, 4) on the left, aligning with the strategy of grouping large tiles in a corner.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), shifting to the right → `0|0|0|8`.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles shift right (no merges) → `0|8|2|0`.  \n   - Row 2: No change (all zeros).  \n   - Row 3: Tiles shift right (no merges) → `0|0|0|4`.  \n   - Resulting board after RIGHT:  \n     0|0|0|8  \n     0|8|2|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|4  \n   - This move also merges tiles but scatters large tiles to the right, which is less strategic for future merges.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed vertically.

However, LEFT strategically positions larger tiles (8, 8, 4) on the left, aligning with the goal of grouping large tiles in a corner for future merges. This makes LEFT the better choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|0|2\nRow 1: 8|2|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 4|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift left, but no merges occur.  \n  - Row 0: `8|2|0|0` (2 moves left).  \n  - Rows 1-3: No changes (no merges).  \n  - Result: No score gain.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift right, but no merges occur.  \n  - Row 0: `0|0|8|2` (8 and 2 shift right).  \n  - Row 1: `0|0|8|2` (8 and 2 shift right).  \n  - Row 3: `0|0|0|4` (4 shifts right).  \n  - Result: No score gain.  \n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift upward, and merges occur in Column 0:  \n  - **Column 0** (vertical): `8` (Row 0), `8` (Row 1), `0` (Row 2), `4` (Row 3).  \n    - Non-zero tiles: `8, 8, 4`.  \n    - Merge the two `8`s into `16` (score +16), then `4` shifts up to Row 1.  \n    - Column 0 becomes: `16` (Row 0), `4` (Row 1), `0` (Row 2), `0` (Row 3).  \n  - **Column 1**: `0` (Row 0), `2` (Row 1), `0` (Row 2), `0` (Row 3).  \n    - `2` shifts up to Row 0. Column 1 becomes: `2` (Row 0), `0` (Row 1), `0` (Row 2), `0` (Row 3).  \n  - **Columns 2-3**: No non-zero tiles to shift.  \n  - Result: Merges `8` + `8` → `16` (score +16). Largest tile (`16`) is placed in the top-left corner (strategic for future merges).  \n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift downward, and merges occur in Column 0:  \n  - **Column 0**: `8` (Row 0), `8` (Row 1), `0` (Row 2), `4` (Row 3).  \n    - Non-zero tiles: `8, 8, 4`.  \n    - Merge the two `8`s into `16` (score +16), then `4` shifts down to Row 3.  \n    - Column 0 becomes: `0` (Row 0), `0` (Row 1), `16` (Row 2), `4` (Row 3).  \n  - **Column 1**: `0` (Row 0), `2` (Row 1), `0` (Row 2), `0` (Row 3).  \n    - `2` shifts down to Row 3.

Result: 16|0|0|4 (score +4).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right: 0|0|0|4 (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: No change (all zeros).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right: 0|0|0|8 (no merge).  \n- **Outcome**: Non-zero tiles cluster on the right. Larger tiles (16, 8) are in the right column, with 8 already in the bottom-right corner (a strategic corner).  \n\n\n### **UP Swipe**  \n- Columns shift upward. No merges occur because no adjacent equal tiles align vertically.  \n- **Outcome**: Tiles remain scattered with no immediate merging potential.  \n\n\n### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- Columns shift downward. No merges occur because no adjacent equal tiles align vertically.  \n- **Outcome**: Tiles remain scattered with no immediate merging potential.  \n\n\n### Strategy Consideration  \nThe goal is to cluster larger tiles in corners for future merging. Swiping RIGHT consolidates smaller tiles (4s) in the right column, aligning with the existing 8 in the bottom-right corner. This positions tiles to potentially merge vertically (e.g., 4 in row 0, column 3 and 4 in row 1, column 3 could merge upward later). In contrast, LEFT clusters tiles on the left but does not leverage the existing corner position of 8.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0 | 8 | 16 | 4  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 4  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 8  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left in each row. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles are equal. The resulting board has tiles spread out with no score gain. This is not strategic.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but all non-zero tiles are already at the rightmost positions in their rows. No movement or merges occur. This is an invalid move.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift upward. In column 3 (values [4, 4, 0, 8]), the two 4s merge into 8 (score +8). The 8 from row 3, column 3 moves up to row 1, column 3. The resulting board has larger tiles (16, 8) in the top row, which is less ideal for corner-based strategy.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift downward. In column 3 (values [4, 4, 0, 8]), the two 4s merge into 8 (score +8). The 8 from row 3, column 3 stays in the bottom row. The 16 from row 0, column 2 moves down to row 3, column 2, and the 8 from row 0, column 1 moves down to row 3, column 1. The resulting board has larger tiles (16, 8) in the bottom row, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping **DOWN** merges the two 4s in column 3, gains 8 points, and positions larger tiles (16, 8) in the bottom row, which is optimal for long-term merging and avoiding gridlock.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|2|8  \nRow 3: 0|8|16|8  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0\/1: All zeros (no change).  \n- Row 2: [0,0,2,8] shifts left to [2,8,0,0] (no merge).  \n- Row 3: [0,8,16,8] shifts left to [8,16,8,0] (no merge).  \n- **Result**: No merges, only tile shifts.

The existing 16 in row 3, column 2 remains adjacent to the new 16 in row 3, column 3, creating potential for future merges (e.g., 16 + 16 = 32 with a RIGHT move).  \n\n\n### Strategic Choice:  \nDOWN is optimal because it merges the 8s in column 3 into 16, keeps the largest tiles (16s) in the bottom row (near the corner), and creates adjacency for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the game board and rules:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|2|0\nRow 3: 0|8|16|16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [8,0,0,0] → [8,0,0,0] (no change).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,0] (no change).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,2,0] → [2,0,0,0] (shift left).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,8,16,16] → shift left to [8,16,16,0], then merge 16+16=32 → [8,32,0,0].  \n- **Result**: 32 is in row 3, column 1 (not a corner).

Score remains 0.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield a score increase of 32, but RIGHT places the new 32 tile in the bottom-right corner (a strategic position to build larger tiles). UP and DOWN do not merge any tiles and are less optimal.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, potential merges, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|8\nRow 1: 0|0|16|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|2\nRow 3: 0|0|8|32\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The largest tile is 32, located in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3). Strategic play often involves keeping large tiles in corners to minimize blocking and maximize future merging opportunities.\n- No adjacent tiles are equal, so no immediate merges are possible. Valid moves rely on shifting tiles into empty spaces.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles in each row shift left. For example:  \n   - Row 0: [0,0,0,8] → [8,0,0,0] (8 moves to column 0).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,16,0] → [16,0,0,0] (16 moves to column 0).  \n   - Row 3: [0,0,8,32] → [8,32,0,0] (8 and 32 shift left).  \n   This moves the 32 from the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3) to row 3, column 1, which is suboptimal for maintaining large tiles in corners.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles in each row shift right. All non-zero tiles are already as far right as possible (e.g., 8 in row 0, column 3; 16 in row 1, column 2; 2 in row 2, column 3; 8 and 32 in row 3, columns 2-3). Moving right results in no change to the board, making it a wasted move.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles in each column shift up. For example:  \n   - Column 2: [0,16,0,8] → [16,8,0,0] (16 and 8 shift up).  \n   - Column 3: [8,0,2,32] → [8,2,32,0] (8, 2, and 32 shift up).  \n   This moves the 32 from row 3, column 3 to row 2, column 3, removing it from the bottom-right corner. While tiles consolidate upward, the 32 is no longer in an optimal corner position.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles in each column shift down. For example:  \n   - Column 2: [0,16,0,8] → [0,0,16,8] (16 and 8 shift down).  \n   - Column 3: [8,0,2,32] → [0,8,2,32] (8, 2, and 32 shift down).  \n   The 32 remains in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), preserving the optimal position for large tiles. Other tiles shift downward, leaving empty spaces in the top rows, which is ideal for adding new tiles without blocking future moves.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN keeps the largest tile (32) in the bottom-right corner, maintains strategic positioning, and avoids unnecessary disruption to tile arrangement. This aligns with the goal of keeping large tiles in corners for future merging opportunities.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the effect of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) on the current game board, focusing on merges, score gain, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 8|0|0|8  \nRow 2: 0|0|16|2  \nRow 3: 0|0|8|32  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 1: Tiles shift left, merging the two 8s into 16 (score +16). Row 1 becomes `16|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles shift left to `16|2|0|0` (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: Tiles shift left to `8|32|0|0` (no merge).  \n   - Result: 32 (largest tile) moves to row 3, column 2 (not a corner).  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 1: Tiles shift right, merging the two 8s into 16 (score +16). Row 1 becomes `0|0|0|16`.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles shift right to `0|0|16|2` (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: Tiles shift right to `0|0|8|32` (no merge).  \n   - Result: 32 (largest tile) remains in row 3, column 3 (bottom-right corner), and 16 is placed in row 1, column 3 (top-right of the same column).  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns shift upward. No merges occur (tiles in columns are distinct).  \n   - Result: 32 remains in row 3, column 3, but no score gain.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns shift downward. No merges occur (tiles in columns are distinct).  \n   - Result: 32 remains in row 3, column 3, but no score gain.  \n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nThe goal is to keep larger tiles in a corner (here, 32 is in the bottom-right corner). Swiping RIGHT preserves 32 in this corner while merging the 8s in row 1 to gain 16 points. This aligns with the strategy of consolidating larger tiles in a corner and merging smaller tiles to build higher scores.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of each possible swipe (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|16|16\nRow 2: 0|0|16|2\nRow 3: 0|0|8|32\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `16|16` merge into `32` (score +32), shifting left to `32|0|0|0`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `16|2` shift left to `16|2|0|0` (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `8|32` shift left to `8|32|0|0` (no merge).  \n- **Result**: Larger tiles (32, 16, 8) cluster in the left column but are not adjacent for future merges.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `16|16` merge into `32` (score +32), shifting right to `0|0|0|32`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `16|2` remain in place (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `8|32` remain in place (no merge).  \n- **Result**: The merged `32` in Row 1, Column 3 aligns vertically with the `32` in Row 3, Column 3 (same column). This positions larger tiles in the rightmost column (a corner), which is strategic for future merges.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles `16` (Row 1) and `16` (Row 2) merge into `32` (score +32), shifting up to `32|8|0|0`.  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles `16` (Row 1), `2` (Row 2), and `32` (Row 3) shift up to `16|2|32|0` (no merge).  \n- **Result**: Larger tiles (32, 16, 32) are scattered across the top and middle rows, with no clear corner clustering.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles `16` (Row 1) and `16` (Row 2) merge into `32` (score +32), shifting down to `0|0|32|8`.  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles `16` (Row 1), `2` (Row 2), and `32` (Row 3) remain in place (no merge).  \n- **Result**: Larger tiles (32, 8, 32) are spread across the middle and bottom rows, with limited potential for immediate future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe **RIGHT** move strategically positions the merged `32` in Row 1, Column 3, aligning it vertically with the existing `32` in Row 3, Column 3.

However, **RIGHT swipe** preserves the `32`s in Column 3 (Row 1 and Row 3), aligning them vertically. This positions the larger tiles in a corner (Column 3) and sets up potential future merges (e.g., merging the two `32`s with a subsequent UP swipe).

However, the merged 32 ends up in the top row, which is suboptimal for keeping large tiles in a corner.  \n4. **DOWN**: Columns are processed downward. In column 2 (third column), the two 16s (row 2 and row 3) shift down and merge into 32 (row 3), yielding 32 points.

However, the merged 64 in Row 1, Column 3 is not in a corner, making future merges less favorable compared to UP.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP is optimal because it merges the 32s (gaining 64 points) and positions the resulting 64s in top-right and bottom-right corners (strategic for future merges). This setup aligns with the goal of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of moving LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize score through merging tiles while strategically positioning larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 0 | 0 | 64\nRow 1: 4 | 0 | 0 | 2\nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 64\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\nKey observations:\n- Two 4s in Column 0 (Row 0 and Row 1) can potentially merge.\n- Two 64s in Column 3 (Row 0 and Row 2) are separated by a 2 in Row 1.\n- Empty tiles are abundant (12 empty spots), so the game is not at risk of ending immediately.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   - Moving LEFT or RIGHT shifts tiles horizontally but does not result in any merges (no adjacent equal tiles in rows). Score remains 0. These moves are suboptimal as they do not contribute to scoring or strategic positioning.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0 (4, 4, 0, 0) shifts up, merging the two 4s into an 8 (score +8). The merged 8 is placed in Row 0, Column 0.  \n   - Column 3 (64, 2, 64, 0) shifts up but does not merge (64s are separated by a 2).  \n   - Resulting grid after UP:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 8 | 0 | 0 | 64  \n     Row 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 2  \n     Row 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 64  \n     Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n     ```  \n   - The 64s in Column 3 remain in Row 0 and Row 2, not in a corner.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0 (4, 4, 0, 0) shifts down, merging the two 4s into an 8 (score +8). The merged 8 is placed in Row 3, Column 0.  \n   - Column 3 (64, 2, 64, 0) shifts down, with the 64 in Row 2 moving to Row 3 (bottom-right corner).  \n   - Resulting grid after DOWN:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n     Row 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 64  \n     Row 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 2  \n     Row 3: 8 | 0 | 0 | 64  \n     ```  \n   - The 64 in Row 3, Column 3 (bottom-right corner) is strategically positioned, aligning with the goal of keeping larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN merges the 4s (scoring 8) and positions the 64 in the bottom-right corner, a strategic advantage for future merges. UP also merges the 4s but leaves the 64s less optimally positioned. Thus, DOWN is the best move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to merge tiles, maximize score, and keep larger tiles in a corner for strategic advantage.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|64\nRow 2: 0|0|0|2\nRow 3: 8|0|16|64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0 remains unchanged (all zeros).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,64] → shifts left to [64,0,0,0] (64 moves to column 0, losing the right-corner position).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,0,2] → shifts left to [2,0,0,0] (2 moves to column 0).  \n   - Row 3: [8,0,16,64] → shifts left to [8,16,64,0] (64 moves from column 3 to column 2, leaving the bottom-right corner).  \n   - **Result**: No merges, and the 64 in row 3 (originally in the bottom-right corner) is moved away from the corner.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0 remains unchanged (all zeros).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,64] → already in the rightmost column (no movement).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,0,2] → already in the rightmost column (no movement).  \n   - Row 3: [8,0,16,64] → shifts right to [0,8,16,64] (8 moves to column 1, 16 to column 2, 64 stays in column 3, preserving the bottom-right corner).  \n   - **Result**: No merges, but the 64 in row 3 remains in the bottom-right corner, and smaller tiles (8, 16) shift closer to the right edge, potentially enabling future merges.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,0,0,8] → shifts up to [8,0,0,0] (8 moves to row 0, column 0).  \n   - Column 1: [0,0,0,0] → no change.  \n   - Column 2: [0,0,0,16] → shifts up to [16,0,0,0] (16 moves to row 0, column 2).  \n   - Column 3: [0,64,2,64] → shifts up to [64,2,64,0] (64 from row 1 moves to row 0, 2 from row 2 to row 1, 64 from row 3 to row 2).  \n   - **Result**: No merges, and the 64 in row 3 (originally in the bottom-right corner) moves to row 2, column 3, losing the corner position.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns 0, 1, 2: All tiles are already at the bottom (no movement possible).  \n   - Column 3: [0,64,2,64] → tiles are already as far down as possible (no movement possible).  \n   - **Result**: No tiles move, so DOWN is not a valid move.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe RIGHT move preserves the 64 in the bottom-right corner (a strategic corner) and shifts smaller tiles (8, 16) closer to the right edge, maintaining flexibility for future merges. Other moves either displace large tiles from corners or are invalid (DOWN). \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of each possible swipe (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement (preferring to keep large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|2|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|64\nRow 2: 0|0|0|2\nRow 3: 0|8|16|64\n```\nKey observations:\n- Large tiles (64s) are in Row 1, Column 3 (R1C3) and Row 3, Column 3 (R3C3) (rightmost column, a corner).\n- Smaller tiles (2s) are in Row 0, Column 1 (R0C1) and Row 2, Column 3 (R2C3).\n- The goal is to align tiles for merging and keep large tiles in corners.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:\n   - Row 0: [0,2,0,0] → [2,0,0,0] (no merge).\n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,64] → [64,0,0,0] (no merge).\n   - Row 2: [0,0,0,2] → [2,0,0,0] (no merge).\n   - Row 3: [0,8,16,64] → [8,16,64,0] (no merge).\n   - **Result**: 64s move to non-corner columns (R1C0 and R3C2), breaking alignment. Poor for corner strategy.\n\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:\n   - Row 0: [0,2,0,0] → [0,0,0,2] (no merge).\n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,64] → [0,0,0,64] (no merge).\n   - Row 2: [0,0,0,2] → [0,0,0,2] (no merge).\n   - Row 3: [0,8,16,64] → [0,8,16,64] (no merge).\n   - **Result**: 64s remain in R1C3 and R3C3 (rightmost column, corner). 2s align vertically in Column 3 (R0C3 and R2C3), setting up potential future merges (e.g., merging 2s and 64s with a subsequent UP swipe).\n\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:\n   - Column 0: All zeros (no change).\n   - Column 1: [2,0,0,8] → [2,8,0,0] (no merge).\n   - Column 2: [0,0,0,16] → [16,0,0,0] (no merge).\n   - Column 3: [0,64,2,64] → [64,2,64,0] (no merge).\n   - **Result**: 64s move to R0C3 and R2C3 (right column), but 2s and 64s are misaligned. No immediate merges, and large tiles are less concentrated.\n\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:\n   - Column 0: All zeros (no change).\n   - Column 1: [2,0,0,8] → [0,0,2,8] (no merge).\n   - Column 2: [0,0,0,16] → [0,0,0,16] (no merge).\n   - Column 3: [0,64,2,64] → [0,0,64,2] (no merge).\n   - **Result**: 64s remain in R1C3 and R3C3, but 2s and 64s are misaligned. No immediate merges, and small tiles block the corner.\n\n\n### Optimal Move:\nThe RIGHT swipe keeps the 64s in the rightmost column (corner) and aligns the 2s vertically in Column 3. This setup allows for potential future merges (e.g., merging the 2s and 64s with a subsequent UP swipe), making it the best strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to identify merges that maximize score while strategically positioning larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|2\nRow 1: 0|0|0|64\nRow 2: 0|4|0|2\nRow 3: 0|8|16|64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur. Score gain: 0.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but all non-zero tiles are already right-aligned in their rows. No merges occur. Score gain: 0.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift up. Columns are processed, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. For example:  \n   - Column 1: [0,0,4,8] → shifts to [4,8,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: [2,64,2,64] → no merges.  \n   Score gain: 0.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift down. Key merges occur in **Column 3** (values: [2,64,2,64] from top to bottom):  \n   - The 64 in Row 1 and 64 in Row 3 are aligned vertically. When shifting down, the 64 in Row 1 moves past the 2 in Row 2 and merges with the 64 in Row 3, forming 128 (score +128).  \n   - The 2 in Row 0 moves down past the now-empty Row 1 and merges with the 2 in Row 2, forming 4 (score +4).  \n   Total score gain: 128 + 4 = 132.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN swipe enables two critical merges (64+64 and 2+2), maximizing the score. Other directions yield no merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges and strategically position larger tiles (preferably in a corner).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 32 | 0 | 2\nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 64\nRow 2: 0 | 4 | 0 | 2\nRow 3: 0 | 8 | 16 | 64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0 shifts to `[32, 2, 0, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1 shifts to `[64, 0, 0, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2 shifts to `[4, 2, 0, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3 shifts to `[8, 16, 64, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - No merges occur. The 64 in Row 3, Column 3 (bottom-right corner) moves left to Column 2, losing its corner position.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0 shifts to `[0, 0, 32, 2]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1 remains `[0, 0, 0, 64]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2 shifts to `[0, 0, 4, 2]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3 remains `[0, 8, 16, 64]` (no merges).  \n   - No merges occur, but the 64 in Row 3, Column 3 (bottom-right corner) stays in place. The sequence `8, 16, 64` in Row 3 is preserved, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0 remains `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 1 shifts to `[32, 4, 8, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 2 shifts to `[16, 0, 0, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 3 shifts to `[2, 64, 2, 64]` (no merges).  \n   - No merges occur. The 64 in Row 3, Column 3 stays, but other tiles (e.g., 16) move to less strategic positions.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0 remains `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 1 shifts to `[0, 32, 4, 8]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 2 remains `[0, 0, 0, 16]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 3 remains `[2, 64, 2, 64]` (no merges).  \n   - No merges occur. The 64 in Row 3, Column 3 stays, but the arrangement of smaller tiles is less favorable.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nAll directions result in no immediate merges. However, **RIGHT** preserves the 64 in the bottom-right corner (a strategic corner) and maintains the sequence `8, 16, 64` in Row 3, which is optimal for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on strategic goals like merging tiles, preserving large tiles in corners, and creating future opportunities.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 2 | 32 | 2\nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 64\nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 4 | 2\nRow 3: 0 | 8 | 16 | 64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Each row shifts left, but no merges occur (e.g., row 0 becomes `2|32|2|0`, row 1 becomes `64|0|0|0`, etc.).  \n   - Large tiles (e.g., 64 in row 1, column 3) are moved to the left, disrupting the corner alignment.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (e.g., row 0 remains `0|2|32|2`, row 1 remains `0|0|0|64`, etc.).  \n   - No meaningful changes; large tiles stay in place but no progress is made.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns shift up, but no merges occur (e.g., column 3 remains `2|64|2|64`, column 1 becomes `2|8|0|0`).  \n   - Large tiles (64s in column 3) stay in the right column, but smaller tiles (e.g., 8, 4) are scattered, reducing future merge potential.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns shift down. Key observations:  \n     - Column 1 (originally `2|0|0|8`) becomes `0|0|2|8`, consolidating 2 and 8 toward the bottom.  \n     - Column 2 (originally `32|0|4|16`) becomes `0|32|4|16`, aligning 32, 4, and 16 vertically.  \n     - Column 3 (originally `2|64|2|64`) remains `2|64|2|64`, but large tiles (64s) stay in the bottom-right corner.  \n   - The bottom row (row 3) becomes `0|8|16|64`, with tiles increasing in value toward the bottom-right corner—a strategic alignment for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe DOWN swipe best aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles (64s) in the bottom-right corner and organizing smaller tiles (8, 16) to facilitate future merges. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN.

No tiles move, and no merges occur. This is an invalid move.  \n\n2. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles in all columns are already positioned at the bottom. No movement or merges occur. This is an invalid move.  \n\n3. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left in each row:  \n   - Row 0: `0|0|16|2` → `16|2|0|0` (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: `0|0|32|64` → `32|64|0|0` (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: `0|2|4|2` → `2|4|2|0` (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: `0|8|16|64` → `8|16|64|0` (no merge).  \n   While tiles move into empty spaces (valid), no merges occur. Larger tiles (e.g., 64s) are spread leftward, which disrupts corner clustering.  \n\n4. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward in each column:  \n   - Column 0: All zeros (no change).  \n   - Column 1: `0|0|2|8` → `2|8|0|0` (tiles move up, no merge).  \n   - Column 2: `16|32|4|16` (no movement, no merge).  \n   - Column 3: `2|64|2|64` (no movement, no merge).  \n   This move is valid (tiles shift into empty spaces) and preserves larger tiles (e.g., 64s, 32, 16) in the right half of the grid, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner for future merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP is the best move as it keeps larger tiles clustered on the right (a strategic corner) and allows for potential future merges, whereas LEFT spreads large tiles leftward. RIGHT and DOWN are invalid.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile movement, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board State:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 2 | 16 | 2  \nRow 1: 0 | 8 | 32 | 64  \nRow 2: 0 | 2 | 4 | 2  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 16 | 64  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1. RIGHT Move:\n- All rows are already shifted right (non-zero tiles occupy the rightmost positions). No tiles move, and no merges occur. **Invalid move** (no change to the board).\n\n#### 2. UP Move:\n- Columns are checked for upward shifts. Most columns are full or have no adjacent duplicates. Tiles do not move, and no merges occur. **Invalid move** (no change to the board).\n\n#### 3. DOWN Move:\n- Column 1 (values `[2, 8, 2, 0]`) shifts down, moving tiles to fill empty spaces. Other columns remain unchanged. While tiles move, no merges occur. **Valid move** but limited strategic benefit.\n\n#### 4. LEFT Move:\n- Each row shifts left, filling empty spaces on the left. Non-zero tiles align to the left, with empty spaces on the right. No merges occur immediately, but this move strategically positions larger tiles (e.g., 64, 32, 16) toward the right, creating opportunities for future merges. **Valid move** with better long-term potential.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe LEFT move shifts tiles to the left, consolidating smaller tiles and leaving empty spaces on the right. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (e.g., 64 in row 1, column 2; 64 in row 3, column 1) and creating space for future merges when new tiles (2 or 4) spawn on the right. This positioning increases the likelihood of merging adjacent tiles in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to merge tiles for higher scores and strategically position larger tiles for future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2|16|2|16\nRow 1: 8|32|64|0\nRow 2: 2|4|2|0\nRow 3: 16|64|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. Tiles in rows with zeros (Rows 1, 2, 3) shift left but do not merge. The board remains largely unchanged, offering no immediate or future merge opportunities.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles in rows with zeros shift right, grouping non-zero tiles toward the right edge.  \n     - Row 1: [8,32,64,0] → [0,8,32,64] (64 moves to column 3).  \n     - Row 2: [2,4,2,0] → [0,2,4,2] (2,4,2 shift right).  \n     - Row 3: [16,64,0,0] → [0,0,16,64] (16,64 shift right).  \n   - This groups larger tiles (64, 32, 16) toward the right columns, setting up potential vertical merges in future moves (e.g., 64 in Row 1, Column 3 and 64 in Row 3, Column 3 could merge with a subsequent UP swipe).  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles in columns with zeros shift up, but no merges occur. Larger tiles remain scattered, with no meaningful repositioning to enable future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles in columns with zeros shift down, but no merges occur. The repositioning of tiles is less strategic, leaving larger tiles (e.g., 64, 32) spread out and less likely to merge in subsequent moves.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe RIGHT swipe is optimal because it groups larger tiles (64, 32, 16) toward the right edge, creating opportunities for vertical merges in future moves. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner to facilitate strategic merging.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile clustering, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 16 | 2 | 16\nRow 1: 0 | 8 | 32 | 64\nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 4 | 2\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 16 | 64\n```\nKey observations:\n- No adjacent tiles of the same value exist initially, so merges are not immediate but depend on shifting tiles into positions where merges become possible in future moves.\n- Larger tiles (64, 32, 16) are scattered, and the goal is to cluster them strategically (e.g., in a corner) to facilitate future merges.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [2, 16, 2, 16] (no zeros, no shift or merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 8, 32, 64] → shifts left to [8, 32, 64, 0] (no merge, but clusters 8, 32, 64 on the left).  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 2, 4, 2] (no zeros, no shift or merge).  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 16, 64] → shifts left to [16, 64, 0, 0] (clusters 16, 64 on the left).  \n\nResult: Tiles in rows 1 and 3 shift left, creating empty spaces on the right (row 1: column 3; row 3: columns 2-3). This clusters larger tiles (64, 32) on the left, which aligns with the strategy of grouping larger tiles for future merges.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [2, 16, 2, 16] (no zeros, no shift or merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 8, 32, 64] (no shift, as tiles are already right-aligned).  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 2, 4, 2] (no shift, as tiles are not aligned to merge or shift right).  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 16, 64] (no shift, as tiles are already right-aligned).  \n\nResult: No meaningful shifts or merges. Larger tiles remain scattered, making future merges less likely.\n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [2, 0, 32, 0] → shifts up to [2, 32, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 1**: [16, 8, 2, 0] → shifts up to [16, 8, 2, 0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 2**: [2, 32, 4, 16] (no zeros, no shift or merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [16, 64, 2, 64] (no zeros, no shift or merge).  \n\nResult: Minimal shifts, with empty spaces in lower rows (row 2: column 0; row 3: columns 0-1). Larger tiles remain spread out, limiting future merge potential.\n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [2, 0, 32, 0] → shifts down to [0, 0, 2, 32] (no merge).  \n- **Column 1**: [16, 8, 2, 0] → shifts down to [0, 16, 8, 2] (no merge).  \n- **Column 2**: [2, 32, 4, 16] (no zeros, no shift or merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [16, 64, 2, 64] (no zeros, no shift or merge).  \n\nResult: Tiles shift down, but larger tiles (64, 32) remain scattered. Empty spaces in upper rows (row 0: columns 0-1; row 1: column 0) do not meaningfully cluster tiles for future merges.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT move is optimal. It clusters larger tiles (8, 32, 64 in row 1; 16, 64 in row 3) on the left side of the grid, creating empty spaces on the right. This positioning aligns with the strategy of grouping larger tiles to facilitate future merges and increases the likelihood of creating adjacent tiles of the same value in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities and strategically position larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 16 | 2 | 16\nRow 1: 8 | 32 | 64 | 0\nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 4 | 2\nRow 3: 16 | 64 | 0 | 4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: No zeros, so tiles remain [2, 16, 2, 16] (no merges or shifts).  \n   - Row 1: Tiles [8, 32, 64, 0] shift left but remain [8, 32, 64, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: No zeros, so tiles remain [32, 2, 4, 2] (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: Tiles [16, 64, 0, 4] shift left to [16, 64, 4, 0] (no merges).  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges, minimal shifts. Larger tiles (e.g., 64 in Row 1, Column 2) remain in non-corner positions.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: No zeros, so tiles remain [2, 16, 2, 16] (no merges or shifts).  \n   - Row 1: Tiles [8, 32, 64, 0] shift right to [0, 8, 32, 64] (no merges). This moves the 64 to the top-right corner (Row 1, Column 3).  \n   - Row 2: No zeros, so tiles remain [32, 2, 4, 2] (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: Tiles [16, 64, 0, 4] shift right to [0, 16, 64, 4] (no merges). This moves the 64 to Row 3, Column 2 (near the bottom-right corner).  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges, but larger tiles (64s) are positioned closer to the right edge, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: Tiles [2, 8, 32, 16] (no zeros, no shifts\/merges).  \n   - Column 1: Tiles [16, 32, 2, 64] (no zeros, no shifts\/merges).  \n   - Column 2: Tiles [2, 64, 4, 0] shift up to [2, 64, 4, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: Tiles [16, 0, 2, 4] shift up to [16, 2, 4, 0] (no merges).  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges, and larger tiles (64s) remain in non-corner positions.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: Tiles [2, 8, 32, 16] (no zeros, no shifts\/merges).  \n   - Column 1: Tiles [16, 32, 2, 64] (no zeros, no shifts\/merges).  \n   - Column 2: Tiles [2, 64, 4, 0] shift down to [0, 2, 64, 4] (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: Tiles [16, 0, 2, 4] shift down to [0, 16, 2, 4] (no merges).  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges, and larger tiles (64s) are scattered without clear corner positioning.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile no move results in immediate merges, **RIGHT** strategically positions the 64 in Row 1, Column 3 (top-right corner) and the 64 in Row 3, Column 2 (near the bottom-right corner). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners to facilitate future merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners, and creating future merge opportunities).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 16 | 2 | 16\nRow 1: 0 | 8 | 32 | 64\nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 4 | 2\nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   All rows have no empty spaces (0s) that would allow tiles to shift right. Tiles in all rows are already right-aligned, and no merges are possible. This is an invalid move.\n\n2. **UP Move**:  \n   Columns are processed upward. The only empty space is in Row 1, Column 0 (0). Tiles in Column 0 (2, 0, 32, 4) shift up, filling the empty space with 32 (from Row 2, Column 0) and 4 (from Row 3, Column 0). No merges occur, and the board changes minimally. This is a valid move but offers limited future merge potential.\n\n3. **DOWN Move**:  \n   Columns are processed downward. The empty space in Row 1, Column 0 (0) is filled by shifting tiles in Column 0 (2, 0, 32, 4) downward. The 2 (Row 0, Column 0) moves down to Row 1, Column 0. No merges occur, and the board changes minimally. This is a valid move but does not meaningfully align large tiles for future merges.\n\n4. **LEFT Move**:  \n   Rows are processed leftward. The empty space in Row 1, Column 0 (0) is filled by shifting tiles in Row 1 (0, 8, 32, 64) left, resulting in Row 1 becoming [8, 32, 64, 0]. No merges occur immediately, but this move aligns the 64 in Row 1, Column 2 with the 64 in Row 3, Column 2 (same column). This alignment creates future merge potential for the 64s if subsequent moves shift tiles upward. Additionally, shifting smaller tiles left in Row 1 supports strategic merging of smaller tiles to build larger ones, aligning with the goal of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT move is optimal because it shifts tiles to create alignment for future merges (e.g., potential 64 merges in Column 2) and supports strategic tile organization. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of merging tiles and creating valid shifts. The current game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 2|16|2|16  \nRow 1: 8|32|64|4  \nRow 2: 32|2|4|2  \nRow 3: 4|16|64|4  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles (0s):** All 16 tiles are occupied, so valid moves depend only on merging adjacent tiles of the same value.  \n- **Adjacent tile check:** No horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles have the same value. For example:  \n  - Row 0: 2, 16, 2, 16 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Row 1: 8, 32, 64, 4 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Row 2: 32, 2, 4, 2 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Row 3: 4, 16, 64, 4 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Columns (vertical check) also show no adjacent duplicates.  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT:** Shifting tiles left or right would not merge any tiles because no adjacent duplicates exist, and all tiles are already fully packed (no empty spaces to shift into).  \n- **UP\/DOWN:** Shifting tiles up or down would similarly fail to merge any tiles, as vertical adjacent tiles are distinct, and no empty spaces exist to allow movement.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full with no adjacent tiles of the same value, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, any direction is technically invalid, but we choose arbitrarily.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential for merging tiles or creating empty spaces for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

However, per the problem constraints, a direction must be chosen. Given the strategic goal of consolidating larger tiles (e.g., 64s in column 2), a **UP** move is selected as a default choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The grid is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 16 | 2 | 16  \nRow 1: 8 | 32 | 64 | 4  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 4 | 2  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 4  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles**: All tiles are occupied (no zeros), so movement requires merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **Adjacent tiles**: Checking all rows and columns, there are no adjacent tiles with the same value. For example:\n  - Row 0: 2, 16, 2, 16 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 1: 8, 32, 64, 4 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 2: 32, 2, 4, 2 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 3: 4, 16, 64, 4 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Columns (vertical check) also show no adjacent duplicates.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **Left\/Right Swipe**: Since all rows are full and have no adjacent duplicates, no tiles merge or shift. The grid remains unchanged.\n- **Up\/Down Swipe**: Similarly, all columns are full with no adjacent duplicates, so no tiles merge or shift. The grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere are no valid moves (no adjacent duplicates to merge, and no empty spaces to shift tiles into). However, per the problem constraints, the answer must be one of the four directions. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and grid dynamics. The current board has no empty tiles (all 16 tiles are occupied), and we check for adjacent tiles that can merge or spaces to shift tiles into.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   All rows are full with no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 0: [2, 16, 2, 16] has no merges (2 and 2, 16 and 16 are separated). Similarly, Rows 1-3 have no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift left (grid is full).  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   All rows are full, and no adjacent equal tiles exist when processed rightward. For example, Row 2: [32, 2, 4, 2] has 2s separated by 4, preventing merges. Tiles cannot shift right (grid is full).  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   All columns are full with no adjacent equal tiles. Column 2: [2, 64, 4, 64] has 64s separated by 4, no merge. Columns 0, 1, 3 also lack adjacent equals. Tiles cannot shift up (grid is full).  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   All columns are full, and no adjacent equal tiles exist when processed downward. Column 3: [16, 4, 2, 4] has 4s separated by 2, no merge. Other columns similarly lack merges. Tiles cannot shift down (grid is full).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe grid is completely full with no empty spaces, and there are no adjacent equal tiles in any direction. By the rules, a valid move requires either adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to shift into. Since neither condition is met, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and in such cases, any direction is technically invalid but must be chosen.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the validity of each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or moving tiles into empty spaces.

No merges or movement occur. The board remains unchanged, and only a new tile (2 or 4) is added. No score gain.\n\n#### RIGHT Move:\nSimilar to LEFT, all rows are full with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges or movement occur. The board remains unchanged, and only a new tile is added. No score gain.\n\n#### UP Move:\nAll columns are full with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges or movement occur. The board remains unchanged, and only a new tile is added.

The two 64s merge into 128 (score +128).  \n  Final column: [0, 2, 0, 128].  \n- **Column 3 (top to bottom: 16, 4, 2, 4):**  \n  Tiles shift down, resulting in [0, 16, 4, 4]. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8).  \n  Final column: [0, 16, 0, 8].  \n\nOther columns (0 and 1) have no merges.

All rows have distinct adjacent tiles (e.g., Row 0: 2, 16, 2, 16; Row 1: 8, 32, 64, 4). No merges are possible, so LEFT and RIGHT are invalid.\n\n2. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - For vertical moves (UP), each column is checked for adjacent identical tiles. Columns 0-3 have distinct adjacent tiles (e.g., Column 0: 2, 8, 32, 4; Column 1: 16, 32, 2, 16). No merges occur, so UP is invalid.\n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - For DOWN, columns are processed from bottom to top. Column 2 (values: 2, 64, 4, 64) has two 64s separated by a 4. When swiping DOWN:  \n     - The 64 in Row 3 (bottom) stays.  \n     - The 4 in Row 2 shifts up to Row 1.  \n     - The 64 in Row 1 shifts down to Row 2, now adjacent to the 64 in Row 3.  \n   - These two 64s merge into 128, creating a valid move.  \n\n\nThus, the only valid move is **DOWN**, as it triggers a merge of the two 64s in Column 2.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on whether tiles can merge or shift to create space for future moves.

Invalid move.  \n4. **DOWN**: Columns are analyzed for merges when tiles shift downward:  \n   - **Column 2 (values: 2, 64, 4, 64)**: Shifting down causes the two 64s (row 1 and row 3) to merge into 128.  \n   - **Column 3 (values: 16, 4, 2, 4)**: Shifting down causes the two 4s (row 1 and row 3) to merge into 8.  \n\nSwiping DOWN allows two merges (64+64=128 and 4+4=8), resulting in a valid move with a score gain of 136.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and game rules.

Swiping down does not cause any merges or movement.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. Thus, there are no valid moves to merge tiles. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.

No merges possible.  \n2. **RIGHT**: All rows have distinct adjacent tiles (e.g., Row 3: 4,16,64,4; no adjacent duplicates). No merges possible.  \n3. **UP**: All columns have distinct adjacent tiles (e.g., Column 0: 2,8,32,4; no adjacent duplicates). No merges possible.  \n4. **DOWN**: Column 2 (values: 2,64,4,64) has two 64s in Row 1 and Row 3. Swiping down moves the 64 in Row 1 down past the 4 in Row 2 to Row 3, where it merges with the 64 in Row 3. This creates a 128 tile, resulting in a valid merge.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly swiping **DOWN** triggers a merge (64 + 64 = 128), making it the valid and optimal move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or tile movements in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 2|16|2|16  \nRow 1: 8|32|64|4  \nRow 2: 32|2|4|2  \nRow 3: 4|16|64|4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [2,16,2,16] → No adjacent equal tiles to merge.  \n   - Row 1: [8,32,64,4] → All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n   - Row 2: [32,2,4,2] → 2s are separated by 4; no adjacency for merging.  \n   - Row 3: [4,16,64,4] → 4s are separated by 16 and 64; no merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [2,16,2,16] → 16s and 2s are non-adjacent; no merges.  \n   - Row 1: [8,32,64,4] → All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n   - Row 2: [32,2,4,2] → 2s are non-adjacent; no merges.  \n   - Row 3: [4,16,64,4] → 4s are non-adjacent; no merges.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: [2,8,32,4] → All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n   - Column 1: [16,32,2,16] → 16s are separated by 32 and 2; no merges.  \n   - Column 2: [2,64,4,64] → 64s are separated by 2 and 4; no adjacency for merging.  \n   - Column 3: [16,4,2,4] → 4s are separated by 16 and 2; no merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: [2,8,32,4] → All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n   - Column 1: [16,32,2,16] → 16s are separated by 32 and 2; no merges.  \n   - Column 2: [2,64,4,64] → 64s are separated by 2 and 4; no merges.  \n   - Column 3: [16,4,2,4] → 4s are separated by 16 and 2; no merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the directions result in immediate tile merges. However, the game requires selecting a direction. Given the strategic goal of aligning larger tiles (e.g., 64s in Column 2) for potential future merges, **LEFT** is chosen to shift smaller tiles toward the left, which may create opportunities for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 2|16|2|16\nRow 1: 8|32|64|4\nRow 2:32|2|4|2\nRow 3:4|16|64|4\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The grid is full (no empty tiles), so valid moves require merging adjacent equal tiles.\n- Strategic merging should aim to consolidate larger tiles in corners for future merges.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   - Rows have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 0: `2|16|2|16` has 2s and 16s separated by other tiles, so no merges. All rows remain unchanged with no merges. These moves are invalid.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are checked for merges. Column 2 (`2|64|4|64`) and Column 3 (`16|4|2|4`) have potential merges:  \n     - Column 2: Shifting up moves the bottom 64 (row 3) past 4 (row 2) to row 2, making `2|64|64|4`. The two 64s merge into 128 (score +128), leaving row 2 empty.  \n     - Column 3: Shifting up moves the bottom 4 (row 3) past 2 (row 2) to row 2, making `16|4|4|2`. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), leaving row 2 empty.  \n   - Merges occur, but the resulting 128 (row 1, column 2) and 8 (row 1, column 1) are in the middle, not corners.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are checked for merges. Column 2 (`2|64|4|64`) and Column 3 (`16|4|2|4`) have critical merges:  \n     - Column 2: Shifting down moves the top 64 (row 1) past 4 (row 2) to row 2, making `2|4|64|64`. The two 64s merge into 128 (score +128), leaving row 2 empty.  \n     - Column 3: Shifting down moves the top 4 (row 1) past 2 (row 2) to row 2, making `16|2|4|4`. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), leaving row 2 empty.  \n   - Merges result in 128 (row 3, column 2) and 8 (row 3, column 3), placing larger tiles in the bottom row near the corner (row 3, column 3), which is strategic for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN consolidates larger tiles (128 and 8) in the bottom row, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners. This maximizes future merging potential.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The key is to identify if any moves result in merging tiles (to gain score) or creating empty spaces (to allow future moves). The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 2|16|2|16\nRow 1: 8|32|64|4\nRow 2: 32|2|4|2\nRow 3: 4|16|64|4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Each row is processed to shift tiles left. All rows are already full (no empty spaces), and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. For example, Row 0: `2|16|2|16` has no adjacent equal tiles. Similarly, Rows 1-3 also have no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and the board remains unchanged.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Each row is processed to shift tiles right. Like the left swipe, all rows are full, and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. For example, Row 3: `4|16|64|4` has no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and the board remains unchanged.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Each column is processed to shift tiles up. All columns are full (no empty spaces), and no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. For example, Column 2: `2|64|4|64` has no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and the board remains unchanged.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Each column is processed to shift tiles down. All columns are full, and no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. For example, Column 3: `16|4|2|4` has no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and the board remains unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is completely full (no empty tiles), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same value in any row or column. By the rules, a valid move requires either adjacent equal tiles (to merge) or empty spaces (to shift tiles into). Since neither condition is met, **no valid moves exist**. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, so any direction is technically a placeholder (though no meaningful action occurs).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate swiping left, right, up, or down.

The 4 in row 3 and the 4 in row 1 (after shifting) become adjacent. These two 4s merge into an 8, generating a valid move and 8 points.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly the DOWN move results in a valid merge (two 4s merging into 8 in column 3).

However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid moves, any direction is technically invalid, but we must choose one.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), and we check for adjacent tiles that can merge or empty spaces to move into (valid moves).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 2 | 16 | 2 | 16  \nRow 1: 8 | 32 | 64 | 4  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 4 | 2  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   All rows are full with no adjacent duplicates. Tiles cannot shift left (no empty spaces), and no merges occur. The board remains unchanged. **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   All rows are full with no adjacent duplicates. Tiles cannot shift right (no empty spaces), and no merges occur. The board remains unchanged. **Invalid move**.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   All columns are full with no adjacent duplicates. Tiles cannot shift up (no empty spaces), and no merges occur. The board remains unchanged. **Invalid move**.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   All columns are full with no adjacent duplicates. Tiles cannot shift down (no empty spaces), and no merges occur. The board remains unchanged. **Invalid move**.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is completely full, and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) are the same. There are no empty spaces to allow tile movement, and no merges are possible in any direction. All moves are invalid. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move for the given 4x4 grid at epoch 99, we analyze the validity of each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. A valid move requires either adjacent tiles of the same number (which can merge) or empty spaces (0s) to shift tiles into. The current grid has no empty tiles (all positions are filled with numbers), so validity depends on the presence of adjacent tiles with the same value.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 16 | 2 | 16  \nRow 1: 8 | 32 | 64 | 4  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 4 | 2  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 4  \n```\n\n### Checking Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**: All rows are fully occupied with no adjacent tiles of the same value. For example, Row 0 has 2, 16, 2, 16 (no adjacent duplicates), and the same applies to Rows 1–3. No merges or shifts are possible.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Similarly, all rows are fully occupied with no adjacent duplicates. For example, Row 3 has 4, 16, 64, 4 (no adjacent duplicates), and other rows follow the same pattern. No merges or shifts are possible.  \n3. **UP**: All columns are fully occupied with no adjacent tiles of the same value. For example, Column 2 has 2, 64, 4, 64 (no adjacent duplicates), and other columns show no adjacent matches. No merges or shifts are possible.  \n4. **DOWN**: All columns are fully occupied with no adjacent tiles of the same value. For example, Column 3 has 16, 4, 2, 4 (no adjacent duplicates), and other columns also lack adjacent matches. No merges or shifts are possible.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and there are no adjacent tiles with the same value in any direction. Thus, no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any direction is technically acceptable (though no move will change the grid state).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the valid move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or empty spaces that allow tile movement. The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number in the direction of the swipe.\n\n### Grid Analysis:\nThe current grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 16 | 2 | 16\nRow 1: 8 | 32 | 64 | 4\nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 4 | 2\nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 64 | 4\n```\n\n### Checking Directions:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: For horizontal moves (left\/right), check rows for adjacent equal tiles.  \n  - Row 0: [2, 16, 2, 16] – No adjacent equal tiles.  \n  - Row 1: [8, 32, 64, 4] – No adjacent equal tiles.  \n  - Row 2: [32, 2, 4, 2] – No adjacent equal tiles.  \n  - Row 3: [4, 16, 64, 4] – No adjacent equal tiles.  \n\n- **UP\/DOWN**: For vertical moves (up\/down), check columns for adjacent equal tiles.  \n  - Column 0: [2, 8, 32, 4] – No adjacent equal tiles.  \n  - Column 1: [16, 32, 2, 16] – No adjacent equal tiles.  \n  - Column 2: [2, 64, 4, 64] – No adjacent equal tiles.  \n  - Column 3: [16, 4, 2, 4] – No adjacent equal tiles.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll tiles are occupied, and no adjacent tiles in any direction are equal. Thus, no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and the epoch is 100 (the final move), any direction is acceptable. \n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: LEFT'\nRules:The game is played on a 4x4 grid, with each tile containing a number that is a power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048). Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n2|16|2|16\n8|32|64|4\n32|2|4|2\n4|16|64|4\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Row 0 becomes `[2,0,0,0]` (2 moves to column 0), Row 2 becomes `[2,0,0,0]` (2 moves to column 0). No merges occur, as the 2s are in separate rows and not adjacent. No score is gained.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right in each row. Row 0 becomes `[0,0,0,2]` (2 moves to column 3), Row 2 becomes `[0,0,0,2]` (2 moves to column 3). No merges occur, as the 2s are in separate rows and not adjacent. No score is gained.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Columns are processed top to bottom. Focus on Column 2 (contains 2s in Row 0 and Row 2):  \n   - Collapse non-zero tiles to the top: `[2, 2, 0, 0]` (zeros removed).  \n   - Merge adjacent equal tiles: The two 2s merge into a 4, resulting in `[4, 0, 0, 0]`.  \n   After merging, Column 2 becomes `[4, 0, 0, 0]`. A new tile (2 or 4) will spawn in an empty spot. This move merges two 2s into a 4, earning 4 points.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Columns are processed bottom to top. Focus on Column 2 (contains 2s in Row 0 and Row 2):  \n   - Collapse non-zero tiles to the bottom: `[0, 0, 2, 2]` (zeros removed).  \n   - Merge adjacent equal tiles: The two 2s merge into a 4, resulting in `[0, 0, 0, 4]`.  \n   After merging, Column 2 becomes `[0, 0, 0, 4]`. A new tile (2 or 4) will spawn in an empty spot. This move also merges two 2s into a 4, earning 4 points.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:  \nBoth UP and DOWN merge the 2s into a 4. However, the goal is to strategically position larger tiles for future merges. Swiping UP places the merged 4 in the top edge (Row 0, Column 2), which may allow easier future merges with new tiles spawning in lower rows. Swiping DOWN places the 4 in the bottom edge (Row 3, Column 2), which is less favorable for early-stage merging. Thus, UP is the better choice.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to position tiles to enable future merges and maximize scoring opportunities.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|4|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|2|0|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: `[0,0,4,0]` → shifts to `[4,0,0,0]` (4 moves to column 0).  \n   - Row 3: `[0,2,0,0]` → shifts to `[2,0,0,0]` (2 moves to column 0).  \n   - Result: 4 in (0,0) and 2 in (3,0) (same column, separated by rows). No merges occur. Future merges would require vertical alignment, which is less efficient.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: `[0,0,4,0]` → shifts to `[0,0,0,4]` (4 moves to column 3).  \n   - Row 3: `[0,2,0,0]` → shifts to `[0,0,0,2]` (2 moves to column 3).  \n   - Result: 4 in (0,3) and 2 in (3,3) (same column, separated by rows). Similar to LEFT, but tiles are in the right column. Merging would still require vertical alignment.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 1 (contains 2 in row 3): 2 shifts up to row 0 (topmost empty spot).  \n   - Column 2 (contains 4 in row 0): 4 remains in row 0 (already at the top).  \n   - Result: Row 0 becomes `[0,2,4,0]` (2 in (0,1), 4 in (0,2)), with all other rows empty.  \n   - Key advantage: 2 and 4 are now adjacent in the same row (row 0). If a new 2 spawns in row 0, column 0 (likely, as 2s are more common), row 0 becomes `[2,2,4,0]`. Swiping LEFT would merge the two 2s into 4 (scoring 4), then merge the resulting 4 with the existing 4 into 8 (scoring 8), creating a high-value tile quickly.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 2 (contains 4 in row 0): 4 shifts down to row 3 (bottommost empty spot).  \n   - Column 1 (contains 2 in row 3): 2 remains in row 3 (already at the bottom).  \n   - Result: Row 3 becomes `[0,2,4,0]` (2 in (3,1), 4 in (3,2)), with all other rows empty.  \n   - While 2 and 4 are adjacent in row 3, this positions them in the bottom row. Future merges would depend on tile spawns in row 3, which is less strategic than aligning them in the top row (UP), where corner positioning is easier to maintain.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping UP aligns the 2 and 4 in the top row, adjacent to each other, creating a setup for efficient future merges. This direction maximizes the potential for scoring by leveraging horizontal adjacency, making it the best choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, positioning larger tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board (rows 0-3):\n- Row 0: 0|2|4|0  \n- Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n- Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n- Row 3: 2|0|0|0  \n\nKey tiles: Two 2s (row 0, column 1; row 3, column 0) and one 4 (row 0, column 2). The goal is to position these tiles to enable future merges.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT:\n- Row 0: [0,2,4,0] → shifts to [2,4,0,0] (no merges).  \n- Row 3: [2,0,0,0] → shifts to [2,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n- Result: Tiles spread across rows 0 and 3 with no immediate merge potential.  \n\n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- Row 0: [0,2,4,0] → shifts to [0,0,2,4] (no merges).  \n- Row 3: [2,0,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,2] (no merges).  \n- Result: Tiles pushed to the right edge but not aligned for merging.  \n\n\n#### 3. UP:\n- Columns are processed top to bottom.  \n  - Column 0: [0,0,0,2] → shifts to [2,0,0,0].  \n  - Column 1: [2,0,0,0] → shifts to [2,0,0,0].  \n  - Column 2: [4,0,0,0] → shifts to [4,0,0,0].  \n  - Column 3: [0,0,0,0] → remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- Result: Row 0 becomes [2,2,4,0]. This aligns the two 2s in row 0 (columns 0 and 1), creating immediate merge potential with a subsequent LEFT move (2+2=4).  \n\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- Columns are processed bottom to top.  \n  - Column 0: [0,0,0,2] → remains [0,0,0,2].  \n  - Column 1: [2,0,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,2].  \n  - Column 2: [4,0,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,4].  \n  - Column 3: [0,0,0,0] → remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- Result: Row 3 becomes [2,2,4,0]. While this aligns the 2s, merging them would require a subsequent LEFT move, but the 4 is now in the bottom row, which is less strategic than keeping it in the top row for future merges.  \n\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nMoving UP aligns the two 2s in row 0 (columns 0 and 1) and positions the 4 in row 0 (column 2). This setup allows for immediate merging of the 2s with a LEFT move in the next epoch, creating a 4 and setting up for further merges (e.g., 4+4=8). This is more advantageous than other moves, as it concentrates tiles in the top row, a common strategic corner for building higher-value tiles.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given game board. The goal is to maximize merging opportunities and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2|2|4|0\nRow 1: 2|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two `2`s merge into `4` (score +4), resulting in `4|4|0|0`.\n- **Row 1**: The `2` shifts left, resulting in `2|0|0|0`.\n- Rows 2 and 3 remain unchanged (all zeros).\n- After merging, the board becomes:\n  ```\n  4|4|0|0\n  2|0|0|0\n  0|0|0|0\n  0|0|0|0\n  ```\n- This leaves two adjacent `4`s in Row 0, which can be merged in the next move (e.g., another LEFT swipe), creating a `8` (score +8). This sets up a favorable chain of merges.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two `2`s merge into `4` (score +4), resulting in `0|0|4|4`.\n- **Row 1**: The `2` shifts right, resulting in `0|0|0|2`.\n- Rows 2 and 3 remain unchanged.\n- After merging, the board becomes:\n  ```\n  0|0|4|4\n  0|0|0|2\n  0|0|0|0\n  0|0|0|0\n  ```\n- While the `4`s are adjacent, they are in the rightmost positions, making future merges less intuitive compared to LEFT.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: The two `2`s (Row 0 and Row 1) merge into `4` (score +4), resulting in `4|0|0|0`.\n- **Column 1**: The `2` (Row 0) shifts up, resulting in `2|0|0|0`.\n- **Column 2**: The `4` (Row 0) shifts up, resulting in `4|0|0|0`.\n- Column 3 remains unchanged (all zeros).\n- After merging, the board becomes:\n  ```\n  4|2|4|0\n  0|0|0|0\n  0|0|0|0\n  0|0|0|0\n  ```\n- The `4`s in Row 0 are separated by a `2`, limiting immediate merge potential.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: The two `2`s (Row 0 and Row 1) shift down and merge into `4` (score +4), resulting in `0|0|0|4`.\n- **Column 1**: The `2` (Row 0) shifts down, resulting in `0|0|0|2`.\n- **Column 2**: The `4` (Row 0) shifts down, resulting in `0|0|0|4`.\n- Column 3 remains unchanged.\n- After merging, the board becomes:\n  ```\n  0|0|0|0\n  0|0|0|0\n  0|0|0|0\n  4|2|4|0\n  ```\n- Similar to UP, the `4`s in Row 3 are separated by a `2`, reducing immediate merge opportunities.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe is optimal because it merges two `2`s into a `4` (score +4) and positions two `4`s adjacently in Row 0. This setup allows for a future LEFT swipe to merge the `4`s into an `8` (score +8), creating a strategic chain of merges. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging potential:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|4|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   - **Row 0**: [4, 4, 0, 0] → Tiles shift left, merging the two 4s into 8.

This strategic alignment supports the goal of combining tiles to increase scores.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes on the given game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|0|0|2  \nRow 1: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 4|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  Row 0: 8|2|0|0  \n  Row 1: 4|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 4|0|0|0  \n- No score gain.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  Row 0: 0|0|8|2  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|4  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|4  \n- No score gain.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Tiles shift upward. We focus on columns (since UP\/DOWN affects columns):  \n  - **Column 0**: Original tiles [8, 4, 0, 4]. Shifting up removes zeros, resulting in [8, 4, 4, 0]. The two 4s in positions 1 and 2 merge into 8 (score +8). Final column: [8, 8, 0, 0].  \n  - **Column 3**: Original tile [2, 0, 0, 0]. Shifting up leaves it as [2, 0, 0, 0].  \n  - Columns 1 and 2: All zeros, unchanged.  \n\n- Resulting board after merging and shifting:  \n  Row 0: 8|0|0|2  \n  Row 1: 8|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n- Score increases by 8. Larger tiles (8s) are concentrated in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles shift downward. Focus on columns:  \n  - **Column 0**: Original tiles [8, 4, 0, 4]. Shifting down removes zeros, resulting in [0, 8, 4, 4]. The two 4s in positions 2 and 3 merge into 8 (score +8). Final column: [0, 8, 0, 8].  \n  - **Column 3**: Original tile [2, 0, 0, 0]. Shifting down moves it to [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n  - Columns 1 and 2: All zeros, unchanged.  \n\n- Resulting board after merging and shifting:  \n  Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 1: 8|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 8|0|0|2  \n- Score increases by 8, but larger tiles (8s) are spread across rows 1 and 3, less strategically positioned than in the UP direction.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP is the best move. It merges two 4s into an 8 (scoring 8), concentrates larger tiles in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and leaves more empty spaces for future moves.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|0|0|2  \nRow 1: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|2|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Tiles shift left in each row:  \n  - Row 0: [8, 0, 0, 2] → [8, 2, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n  - Row 1: [8, 0, 0, 0] → [8, 0, 0, 0] (no change).  \n  - Row 2: [0, 0, 2, 0] → [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n  - Row 3: [0, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 0] (no change).  \n- No tiles merge, so no score gain. Only valid due to tile movement into empty spaces.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Tiles shift right in each row:  \n  - Row 0: [8, 0, 0, 2] → [0, 0, 8, 2] (no merge).  \n  - Row 1: [8, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 8] (no merge).  \n  - Row 2: [0, 0, 2, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merge).  \n  - Row 3: [0, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 0] (no change).  \n- No tiles merge, so no score gain. Only valid due to tile movement into empty spaces.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Tiles shift up in each column:  \n  - Column 0: [8, 8, 0, 0] → [16, 0, 0, 0] (two 8s merge into 16, score +16).  \n  - Column 1: [0, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 0] (no change).  \n  - Column 2: [0, 0, 2, 0] → [2, 0, 0, 0] (2 shifts up).  \n  - Column 3: [2, 0, 0, 0] → [2, 0, 0, 0] (2 shifts up).  \n- Resulting board after merge:  \n  Row 0: 16|0|2|2  \n  Rows 1-3: 0s.  \n- This merges the two 8s into 16 (score +16) and positions the 16 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for larger tiles). The 2s in Row 0, Columns 2-3 are adjacent, enabling future merges (e.g., swiping left next turn).  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles shift down in each column:  \n  - Column 0: [8, 8, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 16] (two 8s merge into 16, score +16).  \n  - Column 1: [0, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 0] (no change).  \n  - Column 2: [0, 0, 2, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 2] (2 shifts down).  \n  - Column 3: [2, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 2] (2 shifts down).  \n- Resulting board after merge:  \n  Row 3: 16|0|2|2  \n  Rows 0-2: 0s.  \n- This also merges the two 8s into 16 (score +16) but positions the 16 in the bottom-left corner. The 2s in Row 3, Columns 2-3 are adjacent, enabling future merges (e.g., swiping right next turn).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nBoth UP and DOWN merge the 8s into 16 (score +16). However, UP positions the 16 in the top-left corner (a common strategic corner) and leaves 2s in the top row (adjacent for potential future merges). This aligns better with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners and setting up future merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 1: 16|0|2|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|2|0|0  \nRow 4: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### 1. Swipe LEFT:\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4). Result: [16, 4, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 2**: No change (all zeros).  \n- **Row 3**: The 2 shifts left. Result: [2, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 4**: No change (all zeros).  \n\nPost-LEFT board:  \n16|4|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n2|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n\nThis move merges the 2s in Row 1, gains a score, and keeps the 16 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for larger tiles).  \n\n\n### 2. Swipe RIGHT:\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4). Result: [16, 0, 0, 4].  \n- **Row 2**: No change (all zeros).  \n- **Row 3**: The 2 shifts right. Result: [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n- **Row 4**: No change (all zeros).  \n\nPost-RIGHT board:  \n16|0|0|4  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|2  \n0|0|0|0  \n\nThis move also merges the 2s but scatters the 16 and 4, leaving them in non-corner positions, which is less strategic.  \n\n\n### 3. Swipe UP:\n- **Column 1**: 16 stays (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: The 2 in Row 3 shifts up to Row 1. Result: [2, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 3**: The 2 in Row 1 stays (no merges).  \n- **Column 4**: The 2 in Row 1 stays (no merges).  \n\nPost-UP board:  \n16|2|2|2  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n\nNo merges occur, so no score is gained. Larger tiles are spread out, which is suboptimal.  \n\n\n### 4. Swipe DOWN:\n- **Column 1**: 16 shifts down to Row 4. Result: [0, 0, 0, 16].  \n- **Column 2**: The 2 in Row 3 shifts down to Row 4. Result: [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n- **Column 3**: The 2 in Row 1 shifts down to Row 4. Result: [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n- **Column 4**: The 2 in Row 1 shifts down to Row 4. Result: [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n\nPost-DOWN board:  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n16|2|2|2  \n\nNo merges occur, so no score is gained. The 16 is isolated in the bottom-left corner, but smaller tiles are clustered, limiting future merging potential.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwipe LEFT is optimal. It merges the 2s in Row 1 (gaining a score), keeps the 16 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and organizes smaller tiles to facilitate future merges. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners, and setting up for future merges).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 4 | 4 | 0  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two adjacent 4s merge into 8 (score +8). Result: `16 | 8 | 0 | 0`.  \n- **Row 1**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 2**: The 2 shifts left (no merging). Result: `2 | 0 | 0 | 0`.  \n- **Row 3**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Outcome**: The largest tile (16) remains in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and the merged 8 is adjacent to 16, setting up for potential future merges (e.g., if another 8 appears next to the 8, they can merge into 16).  \n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), but the 16 remains in column 0. Result: `16 | 0 | 8 | 0`.  \n- **Row 1-3**: No changes (zeros or single 2).  \n- **Outcome**: The 16 stays in the top-left corner, but the merged 8 is separated from 16 by an empty tile, reducing future merge potential compared to LEFT.  \n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift up (16, 0, 2, 0 → 16, 2, 0, 0). No merging (16 and 2 are different).  \n- **Columns 1-2**: Tiles shift up (4, 0, 0, 0 → 4, 0, 0, 0; 4, 0, 0, 0 → 4, 0, 0, 0). No merging.  \n- **Outcome**: No score is gained, and the board structure remains largely unchanged.  \n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift down (16, 0, 2, 0 → 0, 0, 16, 2). No merging (16 and 2 are different).  \n- **Columns 1-2**: Tiles shift down (4, 0, 0, 0 → 0, 0, 0, 4; 4, 0, 0, 0 → 0, 0, 0, 4). The two 4s in Row 3, Columns 1-2 merge into 8 (score +8). Result: Row 3 becomes `2 | 8 | 0 | 0`.  \n- **Outcome**: The largest tile (16) moves to Row 2, Column 0 (not a corner), reducing strategic positioning compared to LEFT.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the best move. It merges the 4s for 8 points, keeps the largest tile (16) in the top-left corner, and positions the merged 8 adjacent to 16, maximizing future merge potential.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate their impact on tile merging, score, and strategic positioning (keeping larger tiles in a corner).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16|8|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 2|2|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### 1. Swipe LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles 16 and 8 are already left-aligned with no adjacent duplicates. No merge.  \n- **Row 1**: All zeros; no change.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles 2 and 2 are adjacent. Merging them into 4 (score +4). The row becomes 4|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 3**: All zeros; no change.  \n\nResulting board after LEFT:  \nRow 0: 16|8|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\nThis keeps the largest tiles (16, 8) in the top-left corner, aligning with the strategy of cornering large tiles.  \n\n\n### 2. Swipe RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles 16 and 8 shift right, becoming 0|0|16|8. No merge.  \n- **Row 1**: All zeros; no change.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles 2 and 2 shift right, merging into 4 (score +4). The row becomes 0|0|0|4.  \n- **Row 3**: All zeros; no change.  \n\nResulting board after RIGHT:  \nRow 0: 0|0|16|8  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\nThis moves the largest tiles (16, 8) to the top-right, which is less optimal for cornering large tiles long-term.  \n\n\n### 3. Swipe UP:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles 16 (row 0) and 2 (row 2) shift up, resulting in 16|2|0|0. No merge (different values).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles 8 (row 0) and 2 (row 2) shift up, resulting in 8|2|0|0. No merge (different values).  \n- Columns 2-3: All zeros; no change.  \n\nResulting board after UP:  \nRow 0: 16|8|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|2|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\nNo merges occur, so no score gain.  \n\n\n### 4. Swipe DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles 16 (row 0) and 2 (row 2) shift down, resulting in 0|0|16|2. No merge (different values).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles 8 (row 0) and 2 (row 2) shift down, resulting in 0|0|8|2. No merge (different values).  \n- Columns 2-3: All zeros; no change.  \n\nResulting board after DOWN:  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 16|8|0|0  \nRow 3: 2|2|0|0  \n\nNo merges occur, so no score gain.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield a merge (score +4), but LEFT keeps the largest tiles (16, 8) in the top-left corner, which is strategically optimal. UP and DOWN do not produce merges. Thus, LEFT is the best move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile positioning. The goal is to set up future merges and keep larger tiles organized.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|8|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 4|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|8|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left in each row.  \n   - Row 0: `16|8|0|0` (no merges, as 16 and 8 are distinct).  \n   - Row 1: `0|0|0|0` (no change).  \n   - Row 2: `4|0|0|0` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: `0|0|8|0` → `8|0|0|0` (no merges).  \n   - No merges occur, and tiles are scattered without strategic alignment.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right in each row.  \n   - Row 0: `16|8|0|0` → `0|0|16|8` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: `0|0|0|0` (no change).  \n   - Row 2: `4|0|0|0` → `0|0|0|4` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: `0|0|8|0` → `0|0|0|8` (no merges).  \n   - No merges occur, and tiles are pushed to the right edge, but no strategic alignment for future merges.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift upward in each column.  \n   - Column 0: `[16, 0, 4, 0]` → `[16, 4, 0, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: `[8, 0, 0, 0]` → `[8, 0, 0, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: `[0, 0, 0, 8]` → `[8, 0, 0, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (no change).  \n   - Resulting board after UP:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 16|8|8|0  \n     Row 1: 4|0|0|0  \n     Rows 2-3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - **Key Insight**: The two 8s in Row 0 (columns 1 and 2) become adjacent in the same row. This positions them to merge in a subsequent LEFT swipe, creating a 16 tile and increasing the score.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift downward in each column.  \n   - Column 0: `[16, 0, 4, 0]` → `[0, 0, 16, 4]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: `[8, 0, 0, 0]` → `[0, 0, 0, 8]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: `[0, 0, 0, 8]` → `[0, 0, 0, 8]` (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (no change).  \n   - Resulting board after DOWN:  \n     ```\n     Rows 0-1: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 16|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 4|8|8|0  \n     ```  \n   - The two 8s in Row 3 (columns 1 and 2) are adjacent but in a row, which could allow a LEFT swipe to merge them. However, this places larger tiles (16, 8, 8) in the bottom row, which is less strategic than grouping them in the top row for easier future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP move positions the two 8s in Row 0, adjacent and ready to merge with a subsequent LEFT swipe. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (top-left) and setting up future merges. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes on the given game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 1: 16|8|8|0  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|4|0  \nRow 4: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left. The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). Result: 16|16|0|0.  \n- **Row 2**: 4 shifts left (no merge). Result: 4|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 3**: 4 shifts left (no merge). Result: 4|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 4**: No change.  \n\nAfter LEFT, the board becomes:  \n16|16|0|0  \n4|0|0|0  \n4|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n\nThis move merges the 8s, creates adjacent 16s in the top-left corner (strategic for future merges), and keeps smaller tiles aligned left for potential future combinations.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right. The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). Result: 0|16|16|0.  \n- **Row 2**: 4 shifts right. Result: 0|0|0|4.  \n- **Row 3**: 4 shifts right.

Result: 16|4|0|0.  \n- **Column 2**: 8 shifts up (no merge). Result: 8|0|0|0.  \n- **Column 3**: 8 and 4 shift up (no merge).

It merges the 8s (gaining 16 points), positions the 16s in the top-left corner (strategic for future merges), and aligns smaller tiles left for potential combinations.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, score gain, and future strategic positioning.\n\n### **LEFT Move Analysis**  \nProcessing each row when moving LEFT:  \n- **Row 1**: `16|16|0|0` → The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in `32|0|0|0`.  \n- **Row 2**: `4|0|0|0` → 4 shifts left, resulting in `4|0|0|0` (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: `4|0|0|0` → 4 shifts left, resulting in `4|0|0|0` (no merge).  \n- **Row 4**: `0|0|8|0` → 8 shifts left, resulting in `8|0|0|0` (no merge).  \n\nAfter the LEFT move, the board becomes:  \n`32|0|0|0`  \n`4|0|0|0`  \n`4|0|0|0`  \n`8|0|0|0`  \n\nThis move merges the 16s for an immediate 32 points, positions the 32 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for larger tiles), and aligns the 4s in the left column for potential future vertical merges (e.g., moving UP next could merge the 4s in rows 2 and 3).\n\n\n### **RIGHT Move Analysis**  \nProcessing each row when moving RIGHT:  \n- **Row 1**: `16|16|0|0` → The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in `0|0|0|32`.  \n- **Row 2**: `4|0|0|0` → 4 shifts right, resulting in `0|0|0|4` (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: `4|0|0|0` → 4 shifts right, resulting in `0|0|0|4` (no merge).  \n- **Row 4**: `0|0|8|0` → 8 shifts right, resulting in `0|0|0|8` (no merge).  \n\nAfter the RIGHT move, the board becomes:  \n`0|0|0|32`  \n`0|0|0|4`  \n`0|0|0|4`  \n`0|0|0|8`  \n\nWhile this also merges the 16s for 32 points, the 32 is placed in the top-right corner. The 4s and 8 are aligned in the right column, but the top-right corner is less strategically advantageous than the top-left (as future merges may be harder to coordinate).\n\n\n### **UP Move Analysis**  \nProcessing each column when moving UP:  \n- **Column 1**: `16, 4, 4, 0` → 4 and 4 merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in `16|8|0|0`.  \n- **Column 2**: `16, 0, 0, 0` → 16 remains, resulting in `16|0|0|0`.  \n- **Column 3**: `0, 0, 0, 0` → No change.  \n- **Column 4**: `0, 0, 0, 8` → 8 shifts up, resulting in `8|0|0|0`.  \n\nAfter the UP move, the board becomes:  \n`16|16|0|8`  \n`8|0|0|0`  \n`0|0|0|0`  \n`0|0|0|0`  \n\nThis only merges the 4s for 8 points, which is far less valuable than merging the 16s.\n\n\n### **DOWN Move Analysis**  \nProcessing each column when moving DOWN:  \n- **Column 1**: `16, 4, 4, 0` → 4 and 4 merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in `0|16|0|8`.  \n- **Column 2**: `16, 0, 0, 0` → 16 shifts down, resulting in `0|0|0|16`.  \n- **Column 3**: `0, 0, 0, 0` → No change.  \n- **Column 4**: `0, 0, 0, 8` → 8 remains, resulting in `0|0|0|8`.  \n\nAfter the DOWN move, the board becomes:  \n`0|0|0|0`  \n`16|0|0|0`  \n`0|0|0|0`  \n`8|16|0|8`  \n\nThis also only merges the 4s for 8 points, making it less optimal.\n\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe LEFT move provides the highest immediate score (32 points) and strategically positions the 32 in the top-left corner, aligning smaller tiles for future merges. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\n32|0|0|0\n4|0|0|0\n4|0|2|0\n8|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Each row shifts left, but no merges occur (e.g., row 1: `32|0|0|0` remains `32|0|0|0`; row 3: `4|0|2|0` becomes `4|2|0|0`).  \n   - No score gain. Poor for merging.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row shifts right, but no merges occur (e.g., row 1: `32|0|0|0` becomes `0|0|0|32`; row 3: `4|0|2|0` becomes `0|0|4|2`).  \n   - No score gain. Equally poor.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom.

However, the `16` is in the bottom-left corner, leaving the `32` isolated in the top-left corner, which is less optimal for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP is better because it consolidates larger tiles (`32`, `16`) in the top-left column, maintaining a strategic corner for future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

No score is gained.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward, merging in columns. Focusing on Column 0 (vertical tiles: 32, 16, 16, 16):  \n   - The two 16s in Row 1 and Row 2 merge into 32 (score +32).  \n   - The remaining 16 in Row 3 shifts up to Row 2.  \n   Column 0 becomes [32 (Row 0), 32 (Row 1), 16 (Row 2), 0 (Row 3)].  \n   Other columns (1-3) have no merges but shift tiles upward.

Larger tiles (32, 32, 16) align vertically in Column 0, setting up for potential future merges (e.g., 32 + 32 = 64).\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward, merging in columns. Focusing on Column 0 (vertical tiles: 32, 16, 16, 16):  \n   - The two 16s in Row 2 and Row 3 merge into 32 (score +32).  \n   - The remaining 16 in Row 1 shifts down to Row 2.  \n   Column 0 becomes [0 (Row 0), 32 (Row 1), 16 (Row 2), 32 (Row 3)].  \n   Other columns (1-3) shift tiles downward.

Result: `16 | 0 | 0 | 0`.  \n- **Row 2**: 32 shifts left to column 0 (no merge). Result: `32 | 0 | 0 | 0`.  \n- **Row 3**: No change.  \n\nLarger tiles (64, 16, 32) remain in the left column, reinforcing the top-left corner—an optimal strategic position.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The three 2s in columns 1-3 merge sequentially. The last two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), leaving the first 2. Result: `0 | 64 | 2 | 4`.  \n- **Row 1**: 16 shifts right to column 3 (no merge). Result: `0 | 0 | 0 | 16`.  \n- **Row 2**: 32 shifts right to column 3 (no merge). Result: `0 | 0 | 0 | 32`.  \n- **Row 3**: No change.  \n\nLarger tiles (64, 16, 32) are scattered, with 16 and 32 in the right column but 64 in column 1—less strategic than LEFT.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- Tiles shift upward. No vertical merges occur (all column values are distinct or isolated). The board remains nearly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles shift downward. No vertical merges occur (all column values are distinct or isolated). The board shifts tiles to the bottom rows, but no score is gained, and larger tiles are scattered.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT is the best move. It merges two 2s into a 4 (score +4), keeps larger tiles (64, 16, 32) in the left column (strengthening the top-left corner), and sets up future merging opportunities for smaller tiles.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\n64|4|2|0\n16|0|0|0\n32|0|0|0\n4|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All rows are already left-aligned (non-zero tiles are as far left as possible). Swiping left would not move any tiles or trigger merges. This is an invalid move.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles in each row shift right. For example, row 1 becomes `0|64|4|2`, row 2 becomes `0|0|0|16`, row 3 becomes `0|0|0|32`, and row 4 becomes `0|0|0|4`. While tiles move, this spreads larger tiles (64, 16, 32, 4) to the right edge, which is suboptimal for corner-based strategy.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Columns are already top-aligned (non-zero tiles are as high as possible). Swiping up would not move any tiles or trigger merges. This is an invalid move.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles in columns 2 and 3 (4 and 2 in row 1) shift down to row 4. Column 1 (64, 16, 32, 4) remains unchanged (all non-zero, no movement). The resulting board after the down swipe is:  \n   ```\n   64|0|0|0  \n   16|0|0|0  \n   32|0|0|0  \n   4|4|2|0  \n   ```  \n   This move keeps the largest tile (64) in the top-left corner (desirable for corner strategy) and positions smaller tiles (4, 4, 2) in row 4, which can potentially merge in subsequent moves (e.g., a left swipe would merge the two 4s in row 4).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe down move is optimal as it preserves the largest tile in a corner and positions smaller tiles for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to maximize immediate score through merges and strategically position larger tiles for future moves.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 32 | 0 | 0 | 16  \nRow 3: 4  | 4 | 2 | 0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: [64, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts left to [64, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [16, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts left to [16, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 0, 0, 16] → Shifts left to [32, 16, 0, 0] (no merge, different values).  \n- **Row 3**: [4, 4, 2, 0] → The two 4s merge into 8, and the 2 shifts left.

The 4s in row 3 are adjacent but do not merge during a DOWN swipe (merges only occur in the direction of the swipe, i.e., vertically for UP\/DOWN).\n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe LEFT swipe provides an immediate merge (4+4→8) and positions larger tiles (64, 16, 32) in the left column (a corner), which is optimal for future strategic merges. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the effect of each possible swipe (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) on tile movement, merging, and strategic positioning. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 64|0|0|0\nRow 1: 16|0|0|0\nRow 2: 32|16|0|0\nRow 3: 8|2|0|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: `[64,0,0,0]` → Tiles shift left, no merging (remains `[64,0,0,0]`).  \n   - **Row 1**: `[16,0,0,0]` → Tiles shift left, no merging (remains `[16,0,0,0]`).  \n   - **Row 2**: `[32,16,0,0]` → Tiles shift left, no merging (remains `[32,16,0,0]`).  \n   - **Row 3**: `[8,2,0,2]` → Tiles shift left, merging the two `2`s into `4`. Result: `[8,4,0,0]` (score +4).  \n   - **Outcome**: Larger tiles (64, 16, 32, 8) remain aligned on the left, maintaining a corner strategy. Empty spaces increase to 10, providing flexibility for future moves.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: `[64,0,0,0]` → Tiles shift right (becomes `[0,0,0,64]`).  \n   - **Row 1**: `[16,0,0,0]` → Tiles shift right (becomes `[0,0,0,16]`).  \n   - **Row 2**: `[32,16,0,0]` → Tiles shift right (becomes `[0,0,32,16]`).  \n   - **Row 3**: `[8,2,0,2]` → Tiles shift right, merging the two `2`s into `4`. Result: `[0,0,8,4]` (score +4).  \n   - **Outcome**: Larger tiles (64, 16, 32, 8) shift to the right, disrupting the left-corner alignment.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed vertically. No merging occurs because all non-zero tiles in columns are distinct. Tiles shift upward but do not merge.  \n   - **Outcome**: Larger tiles scatter, reducing strategic alignment. Empty spaces decrease to 9, limiting future options.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed vertically. No merging occurs because all non-zero tiles in columns are distinct. Tiles remain in their original positions (already as far down as possible).  \n   - **Outcome**: No change in tile positions or merging.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe goal is to keep larger tiles in a corner (here, the top-left corner with 64) and merge smaller tiles to build higher values. Swiping LEFT maintains the left-corner alignment of larger tiles (64, 16, 32, 8) and merges the `2`s in Row 3 into `4`, creating opportunities for future merges (e.g., 4 + 4 = 8). This aligns with the strategy of consolidating tiles in a corner and maximizing empty spaces for flexibility.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given 4x4 grid.

LEFT Move:\n- Each row shifts left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n  Example: Row 1 (32, 0, 0, 8) becomes (32, 8, 0, 0) with no merges.  \n  **No score gain; minimal tile organization.**\n\n#### 2.

UP Move:\n- Columns are processed top-to-bottom. Key merges occur in Column 0:  \n  - Column 0 (64, 32, 32, 8): The two 32s (rows 1 and 2) merge into 64 (score +64). The 8 (row 3) shifts up to row 2.  \n  - Column 1 (0, 0, 16, 4): Shifts up to (16, 4, 0, 0) (no merges).  \n  - Column 3 (0, 8, 0, 0): Shifts up to (8, 0, 0, 0) (no merges).  \n  Resulting grid after UP:  \n  Row 0: 64 | 16 | 0 | 8  \n  Row 1: 64 | 4 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 2: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  **Score gain of 64; larger tiles (64s) stack in the left column (corner), aligning with strategic goals.**\n\n#### 4. DOWN Move:\n- Columns are processed bottom-to-top. Key merges occur in Column 0:  \n  - Column 0 (64, 32, 32, 8): The two 32s (rows 1 and 2) merge into 64 (score +64). The 64 (row 0) shifts down to row 1.  \n  - Column 3 (0, 8, 0, 0): Shifts down to (0, 0, 0, 8) (no merges).  \n  Resulting grid after DOWN:  \n  Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 1: 64 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 2: 64 | 16 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 3: 8 | 4 | 0 | 8  \n  **Score gain of 64, but larger tiles (64s) are spread out, violating the \"keep larger tiles in a corner\" strategy.**\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move. It merges two 32s into 64 (gaining 64 points) and consolidates larger tiles (64s) in the left column (corner), aligning with strategic goals.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN.

In Column 0:  \n     - Tiles are `64 (Row 0), 64 (Row 1), 8 (Row 2), 0 (Row 3)`.  \n     - The two `64`s merge into `128` (score +128), and the `8` shifts up.  \n   - Other columns have no merges.  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 128 | 16 | 0 | 8  \n     Row 1: 8 | 4 | 0 | 32  \n     Row 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n     Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n     ```  \n   - Key benefit: The `128` tile is placed in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and empty spaces remain in lower rows for future tiles.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom-to-top. In Column 0:  \n     - Tiles are `64 (Row 0), 64 (Row 1), 8 (Row 2), 0 (Row 3)`.  \n     - The two `64`s merge into `128` (score +128), and the `8` shifts down.  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n     Row 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n     Row 2: 128 | 4 | 0 | 8  \n     Row 3: 8 | 16 | 0 | 32  \n     ```  \n   - Key drawback: The `128` tile is placed in the middle-left (Row 2, Column 0), not a corner, making future merges harder.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping UP merges the two `64`s into `128` (maximizing immediate score) and positions the `128` in the top-left corner (strategic for future moves). This is better than DOWN, which leaves the `128` in a less optimal position. LEFT and RIGHT do not merge any tiles, so they are suboptimal.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement. The goal is to set up future merges and keep larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 16 | 0 | 8\nRow 1: 8 | 4 | 8 | 32\nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\nKey observations:\n- The largest tile (128) is in the top-left corner (row 0, column 0), which is ideal for strategic play.\n- Empty spaces are in rows 2 and 3, providing flexibility for tile movement.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Each Move:\n#### 1. LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left: `128 | 16 | 8 | 0` (no merges, as 128, 16, 8 are distinct).\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left: `8 | 4 | 8 | 32` (no merges, as 8, 4, 8, 32 are distinct).\n- **Outcome**: No merges, and the 128 remains in the top-left. However, no setup for future merges is created.\n\n#### 2. RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right: `0 | 128 | 16 | 8` (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: Tiles are already right-aligned: `8 | 4 | 8 | 32` (no change, no merges).\n- **Outcome**: No merges, and the 128 moves to row 0, column 1 (suboptimal corner placement).\n\n#### 3. DOWN Move:\n- Tiles shift to the bottom rows (rows 2 and 3), but no merges occur. The 128 moves to row 2, column 0 (losing the top-left corner, which is less strategic).\n- **Outcome**: No merges, and the 128 is displaced from the top-left.\n\n#### 4. UP Move:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift up: `128 | 8 | 0 | 0` (no merge).\n- **Column 1**: Tiles shift up: `16 | 4 | 0 | 0` (no merge).\n- **Column 2**: Tiles shift up: `8 | 0 | 0 | 0` (8 moves to row 0, column 2).\n- **Column 3**: Tiles shift up: `8 | 32 | 0 | 0` (8 remains in row 0, column 3).\n- **Resulting Board**:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 128 | 16 | 8 | 8\n  Row 1: 8 | 4 | 0 | 32\n  Row 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n  Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n  ```\n- **Key Advantage**: Row 0 now has two adjacent 8s (columns 2 and 3). This sets up a future merge (e.g., a subsequent LEFT move would merge these 8s into 16, scoring points). The 128 remains in the top-left corner, maintaining strategic positioning.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP move preserves the 128 in the top-left corner and creates adjacent 8s in row 0, setting up for a future merge. This is the most strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN), focusing on merging opportunities, tile alignment, and keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\n128|16|8|8\n8|4|0|32\n0|4|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 1**: `128|16|8|8` → Tiles shift left. The two `8`s merge into `16`, resulting in `128|16|16|0` (score +16).  \n- **Row 2**: `8|4|0|32` → Tiles shift left, no merges: `8|4|32|0`.  \n- **Row 3**: `0|4|0|0` → Tiles shift left: `4|0|0|0`.  \n- **Row 4**: No change.  \n\nResulting board after LEFT:  \n```\n128|16|16|0\n8|4|32|0\n4|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n```  \n- **Key Benefits**: The largest tile (128) remains in the top-left corner. Merging the `8`s in Row 1 creates a `16`, which can potentially merge again later. Tiles align to the left, preserving space for future moves.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 1**: `128|16|8|8` → Tiles shift right. The two `8`s merge into `16`, but `128` and `16` shift right, resulting in `0|128|16|16` (score +16).  \n- **Row 2**: `8|4|0|32` → Tiles shift right: `0|8|4|32`.  \n- **Row 3**: `0|4|0|0` → Tiles shift right: `0|0|0|4`.  \n- **Row 4**: No change.  \n\nResulting board after RIGHT:  \n```\n0|128|16|16\n0|8|4|32\n0|0|0|4\n0|0|0|0\n```  \n- **Key Drawback**: The largest tile (128) moves from the top-left corner to the top-middle, reducing corner stability.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 1**: `128|8|0|0` → Tiles shift up, no merges: `128|8|0|0`.  \n- **Column 2**: `16|4|4|0` → Tiles shift up. The two `4`s merge into `8`, resulting in `16|8|0|0` (score +8).  \n- **Column 3**: `8|0|0|0` → Tiles shift up: `8|0|0|0`.  \n- **Column 4**: `8|32|0|0` → Tiles shift up: `8|32|0|0`.  \n\nResulting board after UP:  \n```\n128|16|8|8\n8|8|0|32\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n```  \n- **Key Drawback**: Merging the `4`s in Column 2 only yields 8 points (less than LEFT’s 16). The `8`s in Row 1 remain unmerged, reducing future opportunities.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 1**: `128|8|0|0` → Tiles shift down: `0|0|128|8`.  \n- **Column 2**: `16|4|4|0` → Tiles shift down. The two `4`s merge into `8`, resulting in `0|16|8|0` (score +8).  \n- **Column 3**: `8|0|0|0` → Tiles shift down: `0|0|0|8`.  \n- **Column 4**: `8|32|0|0` → Tiles shift down: `0|0|8|32`.  \n\nResulting board after DOWN:  \n```\n0|0|0|0\n0|16|0|0\n128|8|0|8\n8|0|8|32\n```  \n- **Key Drawback**: The largest tile (128) moves to Row 3, losing the top-left corner. This disrupts tile alignment and reduces stability.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT is the best move. It merges the `8`s in Row 1 for 16 points, keeps the largest tile (128) in the top-left corner, and aligns tiles to the left for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\n128|16|16|0\n8|4|32|0\n4|0|0|0\n0|0|0|64\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The only adjacent equal tiles are the two `16`s in the first row (columns 2 and 3). Merging these will yield a `32` and 32 points.\n- Larger tiles (`128` and `64`) should ideally be positioned in corners to facilitate strategic merging.\n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 1**: The two `16`s merge into `32`, shifting left. Result: `128|32|0|0`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `8|4|32|0` shift left (no merging). Result: `8|4|32|0`.  \n- **Row 3**: Tile `4` shifts left. Result: `4|0|0|0`.  \n- **Row 4**: Tile `64` shifts left to the first column. Result: `64|0|0|0`.  \n\n**Outcome**:  \n- Merges the `16`s for 32 points.  \n- `128` remains in the top-left corner (ideal corner position).  \n- `64` moves to the bottom-left corner, aligning large tiles vertically in the left column.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 1**: The two `16`s merge into `32`, shifting right. Result: `0|128|0|32`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `8|4|32|0` shift right (no merging). Result: `0|8|4|32`.  \n- **Row 3**: Tile `4` shifts right to the last column. Result: `0|0|0|4`.  \n- **Row 4**: Tile `64` remains in the bottom-right corner. Result: `0|0|0|64`.  \n\n**Outcome**:  \n- Merges the `16`s for 32 points.  \n- `128` moves to the middle of the first row (not a corner), which is suboptimal for future merging.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- No vertical merges occur (all columns have distinct values). Tiles shift upward but do not merge.  \n- **Result**: No points, and large tiles (`128` and `64`) are scattered without strategic positioning.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- No vertical merges occur (all columns have distinct values). Tiles shift downward but do not merge.  \n- **Result**: No points, and large tiles are spread out with no clear strategic benefit.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe LEFT move merges the `16`s for 32 points while keeping the largest tile (`128`) in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future moves. This is superior to RIGHT (which misplaces `128`), UP, and DOWN (which yield no points).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (e.g., merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners, and setting up future merges).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\n128|32|0|64\n8|4|32|0\n4|0|0|0\n64|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT:\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left: `128|32|64|0` (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left: `8|4|32|0` (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left: `4|0|0|0` (no change).  \n- **Row 4**: Tiles shift left: `64|0|0|0` (no change).  \n- **Outcome**: No merges, and no setup for future merges.  \n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right: `0|128|32|64` (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right: `0|8|4|32` (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right: `0|0|0|4` (no change).  \n- **Row 4**: Tiles shift right: `0|0|0|64` (no change).  \n- **Outcome**: No merges, and no setup for future merges.  \n\n#### 3. UP:\n- **Column 1**: Tiles shift up: `128|8|4|64` (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles shift up: `32|4|0|0` (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles shift up: `32|0|0|0` (32 from row 2, column 3 moves to row 1, column 3).  \n- **Column 4**: Tiles shift up: `64|0|0|0` (no change).  \n- **Resulting Board**:  \n  ```\n  128|32|32|64  \n  8|4|0|0  \n  4|0|0|0  \n  64|0|0|0  \n  ```  \n- **Key Insight**: After moving UP, two 32s become adjacent in row 1 (columns 2 and 3). This sets up a future merge (e.g., moving LEFT next would merge these 32s into 64, generating score).  \n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- **Column 1**: Tiles shift down: `128|8|4|64` (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles shift down: `0|0|32|4` (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles shift down: `0|0|0|32` (no merges).  \n- **Column 4**: Tiles shift down: `0|0|0|64` (no merges).  \n- **Outcome**: No merges, and no setup for future merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP positions two 32s adjacently in row 1, creating a strategic opportunity for a future merge (e.g., LEFT in the next move). This aligns with the goal of maximizing score through strategic merging.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the potential merges and score gains.

The two 64s merge into 128. New row: `128 | 128 | 0 | 0` (score +128).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left to `8 | 4 | 0 | 0` (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left to `8 | 0 | 0 | 0` (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left to `32 | 64 | 0 | 0` (no merge).  \n**Result**: Merges 64s in Row 0, creating adjacent 128s (strategically useful for future merges).  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two 64s merge into 128. New row: `0 | 128 | 0 | 128` (score +128).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right to `0 | 0 | 8 | 4` (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right to `0 | 0 | 0 | 8` (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right to `0 | 0 | 32 | 64` (no merge).  \n**Result**: Merges 64s in Row 0 but leaves 128s separated by a gap (less strategic for future merges).  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed, but no adjacent equal tiles exist vertically. Tiles shift up but no merges occur.  \n**Result**: No score gain, and the board remains mostly unchanged.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed, but no adjacent equal tiles exist vertically. Tiles shift down but no merges occur.  \n**Result**: No score gain, and the board remains mostly unchanged.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the 64s in Row 0 for +128 score. However, LEFT consolidates the 128s adjacently (better for future merges), while RIGHT leaves them separated. UP and DOWN yield no merges.

No score is gained, and empty spaces remain in the same columns. These moves are suboptimal.\n\n2. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0 (top to bottom: 256, 8, 8, 32) contains two 8s. When swiping UP, the 8s merge into 16 (score +16). The merged 16 shifts up to row 1, and the 32 shifts up to row 2. Column 0 becomes [256, 16, 32, 0].  \n   - Other columns (1, 2, 3) have no merges (all tiles are distinct).  \n   - Resulting board after UP:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 256 | 32 | 0 | 0  \n     Row 1: 16 | 4 | 0 | 0  \n     Row 2: 32 | 2 | 0 | 0  \n     Row 3: 0 | 64 | 0 | 0  \n     ```  \n   - The largest tile (256) remains in the top-left corner, a strategic position.\n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0 (top to bottom: 256, 8, 8, 32) also contains two 8s. When swiping DOWN, the 8s merge into 16 (score +16). The merged 16 shifts down to row 2, and the 256 shifts down to row 1. Column 0 becomes [0, 256, 16, 32].  \n   - Other columns (1, 2, 3) have no merges.  \n   - Resulting board after DOWN:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0 | 32 | 0 | 0  \n     Row 1: 256 | 4 | 0 | 0  \n     Row 2: 16 | 2 | 0 | 0  \n     Row 3: 32 | 64 | 0 | 0  \n     ```  \n   - The largest tile (256) moves from the top-left corner to row 1, column 0, which is less strategic.\n\n### Strategic Decision:\nUP is preferred because it merges the 8s (gaining 16 points) while keeping the largest tile (256) in the top-left corner, a key position for future merges and stability.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile positioning, and strategic goals (e.g., clustering large tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 256 | 32 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 0 | 128  \nRow 2: 32 | 2 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 64 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Move**  \n- **Row 0**: [256, 32, 0, 0] → Shifts left (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [16, 4, 0, 128] → Shifts left to [16, 4, 128, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 2, 0, 0] → Shifts left (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 64, 0, 0] → Shifts left to [64, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges, and large tiles (256, 128, 64) are scattered across the grid.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**  \n- **Row 0**: [256, 32, 0, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 256, 32] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [16, 4, 0, 128] → Shifts right to [0, 16, 4, 128] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 2, 0, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 32, 2] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 64, 0, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 0, 64] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges, but large tiles (256, 128, 64) are clustered toward the right edge, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP Move**  \n- **Column 0**: [256, 16, 32, 0] → Shifts up (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [32, 4, 2, 64] → Shifts up (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: All zeros (no change).  \n- **Column 3**: [0, 128, 0, 0] → Shifts up to [128, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges, and large tiles (256, 128, 64) remain scattered.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Move**  \n- **Column 0**: [256, 16, 32, 0] → Shifts down to [0, 256, 16, 32] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [32, 4, 2, 64] → Shifts down (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: All zeros (no change).  \n- **Column 3**: [0, 128, 0, 0] → Shifts down to [0, 0, 0, 128] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges, and large tiles (256, 128, 64) are not meaningfully clustered.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nNone of the moves result in immediate merges. However, the RIGHT move clusters the largest tiles (256, 128, 64) toward the right edge, aligning with the strategic goal of positioning large tiles in corners for future merges.

Larger tiles (e.g., `256`) remain in the top row, which is suboptimal for future merges.  \n\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- Process columns bottom to top:  \n  - **Column 1**: `[16, 16, 0, 0]` → Tiles shift down, merging the two `16`s into `32` (score +32).  \n  - **Column 2**: `[256, 4, 32, 0]` → Tiles shift down to `[0, 256, 4, 32]` (no merges).  \n  - **Column 3**: `[32, 128, 2, 64]` → No shifts (tiles are distinct and already bottom-aligned).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  Row 0: `0|0|0|32`  \n  Row 1: `0|0|256|128`  \n  Row 2: `0|0|4|2`  \n  Row 3: `0|32|32|64`  \n- Score gain: 32. Critically, `256` shifts down to row 1 (closer to the bottom-right corner), and `32`s in row 3 (columns 1 and 2) become adjacent horizontally, setting up a future merge (e.g., with a subsequent LEFT move).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is better because it merges the `16`s (same score as UP), moves `256` closer to the bottom-right corner, and positions two `32`s adjacently in row 3 for a potential future merge. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners and setting up future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, creating empty spaces, and positioning large tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|32\nRow 1: 0|0|256|128\nRow 2: 0|64|4|2\nRow 3: 0|32|32|64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,0,0,32] → shifts to [32,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,256,128] → shifts to [256,128,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [0,64,4,2] → shifts to [64,4,2,0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: [0,32,32,64] → 32s merge into 64, resulting in [64,64,0,0] (score +64).  \n   - Outcome: Merges 32s in Row 3, but large tiles (256, 128) shift left, away from the right corner.  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,0,0,32] → no change (already right-aligned).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,256,128] → no change (already right-aligned).  \n   - Row 2: [0,64,4,2] → no change (no merges possible).  \n   - Row 3: [0,32,32,64] → 32s merge into 64, resulting in [0,0,64,64] (score +64).  \n   - Outcome: Merges 32s in Row 3, keeping large tiles (256, 128) in the right side (closer to the corner) and creating adjacent 64s in Row 3, columns 2-3 (ready for future merges).  \n\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns shift upward, but no merges occur (all non-zero tiles in columns are distinct).  \n   - Outcome: Minimal movement, no score gain, and reduces empty spaces (worse for future moves).  \n\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns shift downward, but no merges occur (all non-zero tiles in columns are distinct).  \n   - Outcome: No score gain and no meaningful tile repositioning.  \n\n\n### Strategic Evaluation:\n- **RIGHT** is optimal because it merges the 32s in Row 3 (scoring 64), keeps large tiles (256, 128) aligned on the right side (closer to the corner), and positions 64s in Row 3, columns 2-3 (adjacent for future merges).

No merges.  \n   - **Row 3**: [128, 128, 0, 0] → The two 128s merge into 256. The row becomes [0, 0, 0, 256].  \n   - **Result**: Merges 128s in Row 3 into 256 (score +256). However, larger tiles (256, 256) are spread to the right, weakening corner consolidation.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed to shift tiles upward. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges.

Invalid move (no tiles shift).  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: Tiles are distinct (32, 2, 16, 4) → no merges or movement.  \n- Row 1: Tiles (256, 2, 256, 0) shift right to [0, 256, 2, 256] → no merges.  \n- Row 2: Tiles are distinct (256, 64, 4, 16) → no merges or movement.  \n- Row 3: 32 shifts right to [0, 0, 0, 32] → movement but no merges.  \n**Result**: No score gain. Valid but suboptimal.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \nColumns are processed upward, with merging of adjacent equal tiles:  \n- **Column 0** (32, 256, 256, 32):  \n  - 256 (row1) and 256 (row2) merge into 512 (score +512).  \n  - 32 (row3) shifts up to row2.  \n  - Result: [32, 512, 32, 0].  \n- **Column 1** (2, 2, 64, 0):  \n  - 2 (row0) and 2 (row1) merge into 4 (score +4).  \n  - 64 (row2) shifts up to row1.  \n  - Result: [4, 64, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 2** (16, 256, 4, 0):  \n  - Tiles are distinct → no merges.

However, larger tiles (512, 256) are spread across rows 2 and 3, with less strategic positioning compared to UP.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP is optimal. It merges high-value tiles (256s and 2s), gains significant score (516), and positions large tiles (512, 256, 64) in row 1 with empty space in row 3 for future moves.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and simulate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to evaluate merges, score gains, and strategic positioning.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 4 | 16 | 4  \nRow 1: 512 | 64 | 256 | 16  \nRow 2: 32 | 0 | 4 | 4  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [32, 4, 16, 4] has no adjacent duplicates; remains unchanged.  \n- **Row 1**: [512, 64, 256, 16] has no adjacent duplicates; remains unchanged.  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 0, 4, 4] shifts left. The two 4s merge into 8, resulting in [32, 8, 0, 0]. Score gain: 8.  \n- **Row 3**: All zeros; remains unchanged.  \n- **Empty spaces**: Row 2 (columns 2-3) and Row 3 (all columns).

This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners (512 in top-left) and sets up potential future merges (e.g., 32s in Column 0 could merge upward later).  \n  - Empty spaces after LEFT are in safer bottom rows, minimizing disruption to top rows with large tiles.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging opportunities and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|4|16|4\nRow 1: 512|64|256|16\nRow 2: 32|8|0|0\nRow 3: 0|16|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0, 1: Tiles are already left-aligned with no adjacent duplicates (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: Tiles (32, 8) are already left-aligned (no change).  \n   - Row 3: 16 shifts left to column 0 (no merges).  \n   - **Result**: No merges, minimal tile movement.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0, 1: Tiles are already right-aligned with no adjacent duplicates (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: 32 and 8 shift right to columns 2 and 3.  \n   - Row 3: 16 shifts right to column 3.  \n   - **Result**: No merges, minimal tile movement.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns 0-3: Tiles are already top-aligned with no adjacent duplicates (no merges or movement).  \n   - **Result**: Invalid move (no tiles shift).  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles (32, 512, 32, 0) shift down, resulting in [0, 32, 512, 32].  \n   - **Column 1**: Tiles (4, 64, 8, 16) are already bottom-aligned (no change).  \n   - **Column 2**: Tiles (16, 256, 0, 0) shift down to [0, 0, 16, 256].  \n   - **Column 3**: Tiles (4, 16, 0, 0) shift down to [0, 0, 4, 16].  \n   - **Result**: Tiles shift downward, creating empty spaces in top rows (rows 0 and 1) and positioning larger tiles (512, 256) in lower rows, which aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners for future merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move, as it creates empty spaces for future tile spawns and positions larger tiles (512, 256) in lower rows, facilitating strategic merging opportunities.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for possible merges and strategic tile placement when swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

Only row 0 has a zero, so tiles shift left but no merges occur. No significant score gain or strategic improvement.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles merge. No rows have zeros (except row 0, column 0), so tiles shift right but no merges occur. No meaningful score gain or positional improvement.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom. Key observation: Column 1 (values `64` (row 0), `64` (row 1), `8` (row 2), `16` (row 3)) has two adjacent `64`s. Swiping up merges these into `128` (score +128). Other columns have no merges.  \n   - Resulting board after UP swipe:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 8 | 128 | 8 | 16  \n     Row 1: 32 | 8 | 16 | 128  \n     Row 2: 512 | 16 | 256 | 4  \n     Row 3: 32 | 0 | 0 | 16  \n     ```  \n   - This move creates a high-value `128` tile in the top row and leaves zeros in the bottom row, which is favorable for future flexibility.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom to top. Column 1 (values `64` (row 0), `64` (row 1), `8` (row 2), `16` (row 3)) could merge `64`s, but they are not adjacent when shifting down (separated by `8` and `16`). No merges occur here. Other columns also lack merges.  \n   - No meaningful score gain or positional improvement.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only valid merge is in column 1 with the two `64`s, which is achieved by swiping UP. This move maximizes immediate score (128 points) and leaves zeros in the bottom row for future moves.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile alignment, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 8 | 16\nRow 1: 32 | 8 | 16 | 128\nRow 2: 512 | 16 | 256 | 4\nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 0 | 16\n```\nKey observations:\n- No immediate merges are possible in any direction (no adjacent tiles with the same number).\n- The only empty tile is at (3, 2) (row 3, column 2).\n- Larger tiles (512, 256, 128) are spread across the board, with 512 in the bottom-left corner (row 2, column 0).\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all tiles in each row are distinct). The empty tile (3, 2) shifts to (3, 3), leaving no strategic advantage.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (all tiles in each row are distinct). The empty tile (3, 2) shifts to (3, 0), but this does not align larger tiles advantageously.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up, but no merges occur (all tiles in each column are distinct). Larger tiles (e.g., 512) remain in place, and the empty tile (3, 2) stays unused.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down, utilizing the empty tile (3, 2). Notably:\n   - In column 2 (values [8, 16, 256, 0]), the 256 (row 2, column 2) moves down to fill the empty tile (3, 2), shifting 16 (row 1, column 2) to row 2 and 8 (row 0, column 2) to row 1. This positions 256 in a lower row, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners or edges.\n   - Other columns shift tiles down but do not merge, but the movement of 256 into the empty space improves future merge potential (e.g., if another 256 appears nearby).\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN strategically positions the 256 tile in a lower row, maintains larger tiles (512) in the bottom-left area, and utilizes the empty space to improve future merge opportunities.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement. The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 16  \nRow 1: 32 | 8 | 8 | 128  \nRow 2: 512 | 16 | 16 | 4  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n1. **UP\/DOWN**:  \n   - All columns are fully occupied (no empty tiles), and no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. Swiping UP or DOWN would not result in any merges or movement. These are invalid moves.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - **Row 1**: The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), shifting to `[0, 32, 16, 128]`.  \n   - **Row 2**: The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32), shifting to `[0, 512, 32, 4]`.  \n   - Other rows remain unchanged.  \n   - However, merging in this direction moves the 512 tile (the largest tile) from column 0 to column 1, reducing its corner position.\n\n3. **LEFT**:  \n   - **Row 1**: The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), shifting to `[32, 16, 128, 0]`.  \n   - **Row 2**: The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32), shifting to `[512, 32, 4, 0]`.  \n   - Other rows remain unchanged.  \n   - The largest tile (512) stays in column 0 (a corner), preserving strategic positioning.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is optimal because it merges tiles for a total score of 48 while keeping the largest tile (512) in a corner, which aligns with the strategy of consolidating large tiles.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for possible merges and strategic positioning when swiping left, right, up, or down. The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 16  \nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 128 | 64  \nRow 2: 512 | 32 | 4 | 0  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **Left Swipe**: Tiles shift left, but no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. No merges occur.  \n2. **Right Swipe**: Tiles shift right, but no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. No merges occur.  \n3. **Up Swipe**: Tiles shift up, but no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. No merges occur.  \n4. **Down Swipe**: Tiles shift down. In **Column 3** (values: 16, 64, 0, 16):  \n   - Shifting down moves the top 16 (Row 0) to Row 2 (filling the empty space), resulting in [0, 64, 16, 16] in Column 3.  \n   - The two 16s in Row 2 and Row 3 of Column 3 merge into a 32, adding 32 to the score.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only valid merge occurs with a down swipe, merging two 16s into a 32. This move generates score and maintains strategic tile positioning.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement and merging potential. The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value to merge or tiles to shift into empty spaces (which do not exist here).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 128  \nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 2: 512 | 32 | 4 | 64  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows are fully occupied with no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 1: `32, 16, 128, 16` has 16s separated by 128 (non-adjacent), so no merging. No tiles shift left.  \n   - **Result**: No movement or merging.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Similar to LEFT, all rows are full with no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 0: `8, 128, 64, 128` has 128s separated by 64 (non-adjacent). No merging or shifting right.  \n   - **Result**: No movement or merging.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are fully occupied with no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Column 0: `8, 32, 512, 32` has 32s separated by 512 (non-adjacent). No merging or shifting up.  \n   - **Result**: No movement or merging.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are fully occupied with no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Column 3: `128, 16, 64, 16` has 16s separated by 64 (non-adjacent). No merging or shifting down.  \n   - **Result**: No movement or merging.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions result in no valid moves (no merging or tile shifts) because the grid is full, and no adjacent tiles are equal. However, the problem requires selecting one of the directions. Given the constraints, any direction is technically invalid, but we must choose one.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. The key is to identify valid moves (adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to shift tiles into) and prioritize merging tiles to maximize scores.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 128\nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16\nRow 2: 512 | 32 | 4 | 64\nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Each row is already fully occupied (no empty tiles). Adjacent tiles in all rows are distinct (e.g., Row 0: 8, 128, 64, 128; no duplicates). No tiles can merge or shift left. **No valid move.**\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Similar to LEFT, all rows are fully occupied. Adjacent tiles in all rows are distinct (e.g., Row 1: 32, 16, 128, 16; no duplicates). No tiles can merge or shift right. **No valid move.**\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   All columns are fully occupied (no empty tiles). Adjacent tiles in all columns are distinct (e.g., Column 0: 8, 32, 512, 32; no duplicates). No tiles can merge or shift up. **No valid move.**\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   All columns are fully occupied. Adjacent tiles in all columns are distinct (e.g., Column 3: 128, 16, 64, 16; no duplicates). No tiles can merge or shift down. **No valid move.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is completely full, and there are no adjacent equal tiles (horizontally or vertically) to merge. By the game rules, there are no valid moves left. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we default to a direction (LEFT) as a placeholder, though no direction is truly valid.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid, which has no empty tiles (zeros) and no adjacent tiles with the same number. A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or moving tiles into empty spaces. Since there are no zeros, the only valid moves would involve merging adjacent same-numbered tiles. \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**: All rows are already left-aligned with no zeros. No adjacent tiles in any row are the same, so no merges occur. No movement or valid action.  \n2. **RIGHT Swipe**: All rows are already right-aligned with no zeros. No adjacent tiles in any row are the same, so no merges occur. No movement or valid action.  \n3. **UP Swipe**: All columns are already top-aligned with no zeros. No adjacent tiles in any column are the same, so no merges occur. No movement or valid action.  \n4. **DOWN Swipe**: All columns are already bottom-aligned with no zeros. No adjacent tiles in any column are the same, so no merges occur. No movement or valid action.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full (no zeros), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number. Thus, no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, a default choice is made.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. The goal is to identify a valid move that allows merging tiles or shifting into empty spaces. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Game Board State:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 128\nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16\nRow 2: 512 | 32 | 4 | 64\nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles (0s):** The grid is completely filled with tiles, so valid moves depend solely on merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **No adjacent duplicates:** There are no horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles with the same value. For example:\n  - 128s in Row 0 (columns 1 and 3) are separated by 64.\n  - 16s in Row 1 (columns 1 and 3) are separated by 128.\n  - 32s in Column 0 (rows 1 and 3) are separated by 512.\n  - 16s in Column 3 (rows 1 and 3) are separated by 64.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT:** All rows are already fully packed with no empty spaces. Tiles cannot shift left, and no adjacent duplicates exist to merge. The board remains unchanged.  \n2. **RIGHT:** Similarly, all rows are fully packed. Tiles cannot shift right, and no adjacent duplicates exist to merge. The board remains unchanged.  \n3. **UP:** All columns are fully packed. Tiles cannot shift up, and no adjacent duplicates exist to merge. The board remains unchanged.  \n4. **DOWN:** All columns are fully packed. Tiles cannot shift down, and no adjacent duplicates exist to merge. The board remains unchanged.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, there are no valid moves that change the board state. However, per the problem’s requirement to select one of the four directions, the choice defaults to **LEFT** (arbitrary among equally invalid options).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize score and set up for future moves by merging tiles effectively.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 128  \nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 2: 512 | 32 | 4 | 64  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \nAll rows are already filled with no adjacent equal tiles to merge. No tiles will move or merge. **No score gain.**\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles move right. The two 128s (positions 1 and 3) become adjacent after shifting, merging into 256. New row: 8 | 64 | 0 | 256. Score +256.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles move right. The two 16s (positions 1 and 3) become adjacent after shifting, merging into 32. New row: 32 | 128 | 0 | 32. Score +32.  \n- **Rows 2 and 3**: No adjacent equal tiles to merge. Tiles remain in place.  \n\nTotal score gain: 256 + 32 = 288.  \n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \nAll columns have no adjacent equal tiles to merge. No tiles will move or merge. **No score gain.**\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \nOnly **Column 3** has two 16s (positions 1 and 3). After shifting down, the 16s merge into 32. New column: 128 | 64 | 0 | 32. Score +32. Other columns have no merges.  \n\nTotal score gain: 32.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe **RIGHT** swipe results in the highest score gain (288) by merging 128s in Row 0 and 16s in Row 1. This move is optimal for maximizing immediate score and maintaining flexibility for future moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of merging adjacent tiles of the same number and shifting tiles into empty spaces. The grid is currently full (no 0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number in the direction of the swipe.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 128\nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16\nRow 2: 512 | 32 | 4 | 64\nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Each row is checked for adjacent equal tiles. All rows have distinct adjacent tiles (e.g., Row 0: 8, 128, 64, 128; no merges). Since the grid is full, no tiles can shift into empty spaces. **No valid merges or shifts.**\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Similar to LEFT, each row has no adjacent equal tiles (e.g., Row 1: 32, 16, 128, 16; no merges). The grid is full, so no tiles shift. **No valid merges or shifts.**\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Each column is checked for adjacent equal tiles. All columns have distinct adjacent tiles (e.g., Column 0: 8, 32, 512, 32; no merges). The grid is full, so no tiles shift. **No valid merges or shifts.**\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Each column is checked for adjacent equal tiles. For example, Column 3: 128, 16, 64, 16. The 16s in Row 1 and Row 3 are separated by 64, so they are not adjacent. Similarly, other columns (e.g., Column 0: 8, 32, 512, 32) have no adjacent equal tiles. The grid is full, so no tiles shift. **No valid merges or shifts.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves are invalid because the grid is full, and there are no adjacent equal tiles in any direction. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four options, the most plausible choice (by default) is **DOWN**.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging and movement rules.

Given no valid moves, the game would end, but the required format forces a choice.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify merges that increase the score or strategically position tiles for future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 128\nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16\nRow 2: 512 | 32 | 4 | 64\nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Each row is processed left to right. All rows are full (no zeros), and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. For example:  \n   - Row 0: `8, 128, 64, 128` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: `32, 16, 128, 16` (no merges).  \n   - Rows 2 and 3: All tiles are distinct.  \n   No merges occur; the board remains unchanged.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Each row is processed right to left. Similar to the left swipe, all rows are full, and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. For example:  \n   - Row 0: `8, 128, 64, 128` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: `32, 16, 128, 16` (no merges).  \n   - Rows 2 and 3: All tiles are distinct.  \n   No merges occur; the board remains unchanged.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Each column is processed top to bottom.

This means no valid merges are possible, and all moves (left, right, up, down) will not change the board. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any choice is technically valid (though no merges or score gains occur).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic tile placement. The game board is full (no zeros), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles after shifting.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: [8, 128, 64, 128] shifts left to [8, 128, 128, 64], merging the two 128s into 256. Result: [8, 256, 64, 0]. Score +256.  \n   - **Row 1**: [32, 16, 128, 16] shifts left to [32, 16, 16, 128], merging the two 16s into 32. Result: [32, 32, 128, 0]. Score +32.  \n   - Rows 2 and 3 have no merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: [8, 128, 64, 128] shifts right to [8, 64, 128, 128], merging the two 128s into 256. Result: [8, 64, 256, 0].

Score +64.  \n   - **Column 3**: [128, 16, 64, 16] shifts up to [128, 16, 16, 64], merging the two 16s into 32. Result: [128, 32, 64, 0]. Score +32.  \n   - Other columns have no merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - **Column 0**: [8, 32, 512, 32] shifts down to [8, 512, 32, 32], merging the two 32s into 64. Result: [8, 512, 64, 0]. Score +64.  \n   - Other columns have no merges.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield the highest scores (256 + 32 = 288). The largest tile (512) is in the bottom-left corner (row 2, column 0). Keeping large tiles in corners is strategic. Between LEFT and RIGHT:  \n- **LEFT** places a 256 in row 0, column 1 (adjacent to the 512 in row 2, column 0), potentially facilitating future merges.  \n- **RIGHT** places a 256 in row 0, column 2, which is less adjacent to the 512.  \n\nThus, **LEFT** is better for maintaining strategic tile placement.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify moves that enable tile merges (to increase the score) or strategically position larger tiles for future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 128\nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16\nRow 2: 512 | 32 | 4 | 64\nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift left, merging adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Row 0: [8, 128, 64, 128] → No merges (128s are separated by 64).  \n   - Row 1: [32, 16, 128, 16] → No merges (16s are separated by 128).  \n   - Row 2: [512, 32, 4, 64] → No merges (all distinct).  \n   - Row 3: [32, 4, 256, 16] → No merges (all distinct).  \n   **Result**: No merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right, merging adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Row 0: [8, 128, 64, 128] → No merges (128s are separated by 64).  \n   - Row 1: [32, 16, 128, 16] → No merges (16s are separated by 128).  \n   - Row 2: [512, 32, 4, 64] → No merges (all distinct).  \n   - Row 3: [32, 4, 256, 16] → No merges (all distinct).  \n   **Result**: No merges.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift up, merging adjacent equal tiles in columns.  \n   - Column 0: [8, 32, 512, 32] → No merges (32s are separated by 512).  \n   - Column 1: [128, 16, 32, 4] → No merges (all distinct).  \n   - Column 2: [64, 128, 4, 256] → No merges (all distinct).  \n   - Column 3: [128, 16, 64, 16] → No merges (16s are separated by 64).  \n   **Result**: No merges.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift down, merging adjacent equal tiles in columns.  \n   - Column 0: [8, 32, 512, 32] → No merges (32s are separated by 512).  \n   - Column 1: [128, 16, 32, 4] → No merges (all distinct).  \n   - Column 2: [64, 128, 4, 256] → No merges (all distinct).  \n   - Column 3: [128, 16, 64, 16] → No merges (16s are separated by 64).  \n   **Result**: No merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions fail to produce merges, and there are no empty tiles to allow tile movement. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the choice is arbitrary. A common strategy in 2048 is to prioritize keeping larger tiles in a corner (e.g., 512 in row 2, column 0). Swiping left aligns with maintaining this corner for potential future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile alignment. The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 128  \nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 2: 512 | 32 | 4 | 64  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no zeros), so movement requires merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **No adjacent duplicates**: Checking all horizontal and vertical neighbors (same row or column, adjacent positions) confirms no two tiles of the same value are adjacent. For example:\n  - Row 0: 8, 128, 64, 128 (128s are separated by 64).\n  - Row 1: 32, 16, 128, 16 (16s are separated by 128).\n  - Column 0: 8, 32, 512, 32 (32s are separated by 512).\n  - Column 3: 128, 16, 64, 16 (16s are separated by 64).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipe**: Tiles cannot shift (no empty spaces) and no adjacent duplicates to merge. The board remains unchanged.\n- **UP\/DOWN Swipe**: Similarly, tiles cannot shift (no empty spaces) and no adjacent duplicates to merge. The board remains unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves are invalid because there are no adjacent duplicates to merge and no empty spaces to shift tiles into. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the choice defaults to a direction that minimally disrupts tile alignment (e.g., UP, to keep larger tiles like 512 in the top half).\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) by checking if tiles can shift or merge according to the game rules. The game board has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number to merge after shifting.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 128  \nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 2: 512 | 32 | 4 | 64  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: [8, 128, 64, 128].

No adjacent tiles in any row are equal, so no merges occur. Tiles cannot shift right (no empty spaces to fill). Thus, RIGHT is invalid.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   All columns are fully occupied (no zeros). No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, so no merges occur.

The goal is to maximize the score from merging tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 128  \nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 2: 512 | 32 | 4 | 64  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: 8, 128, 64, 128 (no merges, as all tiles are distinct).  \n- **Row 1**: 32, 16, 128, 16 → Shifts left to 32, 16, 16, 128 → Merges 16+16 into 32.

New column: 128, 32, 64, 0 (score +32).  \n**Total Score**: 64 + 32 = 96.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: 8, 32, 512, 32 → Shifts down to 8, 32, 32, 512 → Merges 32+32 into 64. New column: 8, 0, 64, 512 (score +64).  \n- **Column 1**: 128, 16, 32, 4 (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: 64, 128, 4, 256 (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: 128, 16, 64, 16 → Shifts down to 128, 64, 16, 16 → Merges 16+16 into 32. New column: 128, 64, 0, 32 (score +32).  \n**Total Score**: 64 + 32 = 96.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe RIGHT move yields the highest score (288) by merging two 128s into a 256 and two 16s into a 32. This is significantly better than the other options.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to identify merges and strategic positioning. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 128\nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16\nRow 2: 512 | 32 | 4 | 64\nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles are [8, 128, 64, 128]. No adjacent duplicates to merge.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles are [32, 16, 128, 16]. No adjacent duplicates to merge.  \n   - Rows 2 and 3: All tiles are distinct.  \n   - **Result**: No merges.  \n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - Columns 0-3: All columns have distinct tiles with no adjacent duplicates.  \n   - **Result**: No merges.  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns 0-3: All columns have distinct tiles with no adjacent duplicates.  \n   - **Result**: No merges.  \n\n4. **RIGHT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles are [8, 128, 64, 128]. When moving right:  \n     - The 128 in column 1 shifts right past the 64 in column 2, moving to column 2.  \n     - The 128 in column 3 remains in column 3.  \n     - This makes the two 128s adjacent (columns 2 and 3), merging into 256.  \n     - The row becomes [8, 64, 256, 0] (with an empty tile added after merging).  \n   - Rows 1-3: No merges, but the key merge in Row 0 provides a significant score gain.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT merges the two 128s in Row 0 into 256, generating 256 points and creating an empty tile for future moves. This is the most strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or tile movements in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same number.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|128|64|128  \nRow 1: 32|16|128|16  \nRow 2: 512|32|4|64  \nRow 3: 32|4|256|16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. Tiles cannot shift left (no empty spaces), so no merges or movement. **Invalid**.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. Tiles cannot shift right (no empty spaces), so no merges or movement. **Invalid**.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - All columns have no adjacent equal tiles. Tiles cannot shift up (no empty spaces), so no merges or movement. **Invalid**.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - All columns have no adjacent equal tiles. Tiles cannot shift down (no empty spaces), so no merges or movement. **Invalid**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and there are no adjacent tiles of the same number in any direction. Thus, no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we choose arbitrarily.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. The key is to check if tiles can merge or shift into empty spaces, as valid moves require either merging adjacent equal tiles or moving tiles into empty spaces.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 128  \nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 2: 512 | 32 | 4 | 64  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \nFor each row, tiles shift left. Since there are no empty spaces (zeros) and no adjacent equal tiles in any row, no merging or movement occurs.  \n- Row 0: [8, 128, 64, 128] (no merges, no shifts)  \n- Row 1: [32, 16, 128, 16] (no merges, no shifts)  \n- Row 2: [512, 32, 4, 64] (no merges, no shifts)  \n- Row 3: [32, 4, 256, 16] (no merges, no shifts)  \n**Result: Invalid move (no changes).**\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nFor each row, tiles shift right. Similar to LEFT, no empty spaces exist, and no adjacent equal tiles in any row allow merging or shifting.  \n- Row 0: [8, 128, 64, 128] (no merges, no shifts)  \n- Row 1: [32, 16, 128, 16] (no merges, no shifts)  \n- Row 2: [512, 32, 4, 64] (no merges, no shifts)  \n- Row 3: [32, 4, 256, 16] (no merges, no shifts)  \n**Result: Invalid move (no changes).**\n\n#### **UP**  \nFor each column, tiles shift upward. No empty spaces exist, and no adjacent equal tiles in any column allow merging or shifting.  \n- Column 0: [8, 32, 512, 32] (no merges, no shifts)  \n- Column 1: [128, 16, 32, 4] (no merges, no shifts)  \n- Column 2: [64, 128, 4, 256] (no merges, no shifts)  \n- Column 3: [128, 16, 64, 16] (no merges, no shifts)  \n**Result: Invalid move (no changes).**\n\n#### **DOWN**  \nFor each column, tiles shift downward. Again, no empty spaces exist, and no adjacent equal tiles in any column allow merging or shifting.  \n- Column 0: [8, 32, 512, 32] (no merges, no shifts)  \n- Column 1: [128, 16, 32, 4] (no merges, no shifts)  \n- Column 2: [64, 128, 4, 256] (no merges, no shifts)  \n- Column 3: [128, 16, 64, 16] (no merges, no shifts)  \n**Result: Invalid move (no changes).**\n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nAll directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are invalid because the grid is full (no empty spaces) and there are no adjacent equal tiles to merge. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, any direction is equally invalid, but we choose one as per the requirement.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile shifts. The grid is fully occupied (no 0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number to merge. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 128  \nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 2: 512 | 32 | 4 | 64  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Each row is processed left-to-right. No adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., Row 0: 8, 128, 64, 128; Row 1: 32, 16, 128, 16; etc.). No merges occur.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row is processed right-to-left. Similarly, no adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., Row 0: 8, 128, 64, 128; Row 1: 32, 16, 128, 16; etc.). No merges occur.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Each column is processed top-to-bottom. No adjacent tiles in any column are the same (e.g., Column 0: 8, 32, 512, 32; Column 1: 128, 16, 32, 4; etc.). No merges occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Each column is processed bottom-to-top. Again, no adjacent tiles in any column are the same (e.g., Column 0: 8, 32, 512, 32; Column 3: 128, 16, 64, 16; etc.). No merges occur.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied with no empty spaces, and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number in any direction. Thus, no valid merges are possible for any move. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN), and all moves are equally invalid, we choose **LEFT** as the default.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for valid moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules. A valid move requires either merging adjacent equal tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces. The current grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent equal tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 128 | 64 | 128  \nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 2: 512 | 32 | 4 | 64  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 256 | 16  \n```\n\n### Checking Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**: For horizontal moves (LEFT\/RIGHT), we check if adjacent tiles in any row can merge.  \n   - Row 0: 8, 128, 64, 128 (no adjacent equals).  \n   - Row 1: 32, 16, 128, 16 (no adjacent equals).  \n   - Row 2: 512, 32, 4, 64 (no adjacent equals).  \n   - Row 3: 32, 4, 256, 16 (no adjacent equals).  \n   No merges possible in any row. Since the grid is full (no empty tiles), shifting left\/right does not move tiles. **LEFT\/RIGHT are invalid**.\n\n2. **UP\/DOWN**: For vertical moves (UP\/DOWN), we check if adjacent tiles in any column can merge.  \n   - Column 0: 8, 32, 512, 32 (no adjacent equals).  \n   - Column 1: 128, 16, 32, 4 (no adjacent equals).  \n   - Column 2: 64, 128, 4, 256 (no adjacent equals).  \n   - Column 3: 128, 16, 64, 16 (no adjacent equals).  \n   No merges possible in any column. Since the grid is full, shifting up\/down does not move tiles. **UP\/DOWN are invalid**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent equal tiles, so no valid moves exist. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, any direction is technically invalid, but a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move for the given 4x4 grid at epoch 99, we analyze the validity of each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. A valid move requires either adjacent tiles with the same number (allowing a merge) or empty spaces (0s) to shift tiles into. \n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe grid is fully occupied (no 0s), so valid moves depend solely on the presence of adjacent tiles with the same number. We check all rows and columns for adjacent duplicates:\n\n#### Rows (Horizontal Adjacents):\n- Row 0: [8, 128, 64, 128] → No adjacent duplicates.  \n- Row 1: [32, 16, 128, 16] → No adjacent duplicates.  \n- Row 2: [512, 32, 4, 64] → No adjacent duplicates.  \n- Row 3: [32, 4, 256, 16] → No adjacent duplicates.  \n\n#### Columns (Vertical Adjacents):\n- Column 0: [8, 32, 512, 32] → No adjacent duplicates.  \n- Column 1: [128, 16, 32, 4] → No adjacent duplicates.  \n- Column 2: [64, 128, 4, 256] → No adjacent duplicates.  \n- Column 3: [128, 16, 64, 16] → No adjacent duplicates.  \n\n### Move Validity:\nSince the grid is full (no 0s) and no adjacent tiles have the same number, **no valid moves exist** under the game rules. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, any direction is technically invalid, but a direction must be chosen.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the valid move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or empty spaces to shift tiles into. The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number in the direction of the swipe.\n\n### Checking Directions:\n- **LEFT**: All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 1: `8|128|64|128` has no adjacent duplicates. No merges or shifts possible.  \n- **RIGHT**: All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 2: `32|16|128|16` has no adjacent duplicates. No merges or shifts possible.  \n- **UP**: All columns have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Column 1: `8|32|512|32` has no adjacent duplicates. No merges or shifts possible.  \n- **DOWN**: All columns have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Column 4: `128|16|64|16` has no adjacent duplicates. No merges or shifts possible.  \n\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are equal in any direction, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. \n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n8|128|64|128\n32|16|128|16\n512|32|4|64\n32|4|256|16\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The 2s in row 1, columns 1 and 3 move to row 0, columns 1 and 3, respectively. No merging occurs because the 2s remain non-adjacent. No score is gained.  \n2. **DOWN**: Swiping down shifts tiles downward. The 2s in row 1, columns 1 and 3 move to row 3, columns 1 and 3, respectively. No merging occurs, and no score is gained.  \n3. **LEFT**: Swiping left shifts tiles to the left. In row 1, the 2 in column 1 moves to column 0, and the 2 in column 3 moves to column 1. These adjacent 2s merge into a 4 (score +4). The resulting row 1 becomes `[4, 0, 0, 0]`.  \n4. **RIGHT**: Swiping right shifts tiles to the right. In row 1, the 2 in column 1 moves to column 2, and the 2 in column 3 stays in column 3. These adjacent 2s merge into a 4 (score +4). The resulting row 1 becomes `[0, 0, 0, 4]`.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT merge the 2s into a 4, generating score. Since the goal is to merge tiles strategically, either direction is valid. However, early in the game, consolidating tiles to one side (e.g., left) can facilitate future merges by keeping larger tiles aligned. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current game board and the strategic goal of keeping larger tiles in a corner while maximizing merging potential. The game board is:\n\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|2|0  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**: Tiles shift left. The 4 in row 1 stays in column 0, and the 2 in row 3 moves to column 0. The resulting board has the 4 and 2 in column 0 (rows 1 and 3). No merges occur, and the 4 is in the top-left corner (a corner), but the 2 is in the same column, leaving limited merging potential.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right. The 4 in row 1 moves to column 3 (top-right corner), and the 2 in row 3 moves to column 3 (bottom-right corner). The resulting board has the 4 and 2 aligned in the rightmost column (both in corners). This positions the largest tile (4) in a corner and the smaller tile (2) in the same column, creating future merging opportunities (e.g., a new 2 in column 3 could merge with the existing 2 in a subsequent move).  \n\n3. **UP**: Tiles shift up. The 4 in row 1 moves to row 0 (top-left corner), and the 2 in row 3 moves to row 0 (column 2). The 4 is in a corner, but the 2 is in the same row, reducing alignment for merging.  \n\n4. **DOWN**: Tiles shift down. The 4 in row 1 moves to row 3 (column 0, bottom-left corner), and the 2 in row 3 stays in column 2. The 4 is in a corner, but the 2 is in a different column, limiting merging potential.  \n\n### Strategic Choice:\nMoving **RIGHT** aligns the largest tile (4) in the top-right corner and the smaller tile (2) in the bottom-right corner, both in the same column. This positions them for potential future merges if new tiles (e.g., 2) are added in the rightmost column, making it the most strategic move.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|2|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|4\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left in each row.  \n   - Row 0: `[0,0,2,0]` → `[2,0,0,0]` (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: `[0,0,0,4]` → `[4,0,0,0]` (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: No change.  \n   - Row 3: `[0,0,0,2]` → `[2,0,0,0]` (no merge).  \n   Result: Tiles are left-aligned, but no merges occur. No immediate score gain.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right in each row.  \n   - Row 0: `[0,0,2,0]` → `[0,0,0,2]` (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: `[0,0,0,4]` → `[0,0,0,4]` (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: No change.  \n   - Row 3: `[0,0,0,2]` → `[0,0,0,2]` (no merge).  \n   Result: Tiles are right-aligned, but no merges occur. No immediate score gain.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up in each column.  \n   - Column 0-1: All zeros (no change).  \n   - Column 2: `[2,0,0,0]` → `[2,0,0,0]` (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: `[0,4,0,2]` → `[4,2,0,0]` (no merge, 4 and 2 are different).  \n   Result: Tiles stack upward, but no merges occur. No immediate score gain.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down in each column.  \n   - Column 0-1: All zeros (no change).  \n   - Column 2: `[2,0,0,0]` → `[0,0,0,2]` (2 moves to row 3).  \n   - Column 3: `[0,4,0,2]` → `[0,0,4,2]` (4 moves to row 2, 2 stays in row 3).  \n   After shifting, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|4  \n   Row 3: 0|0|2|2  \n   ```  \n   Here, row 3 has two adjacent 2s. While no merge occurs during the DOWN swipe itself, this positions the 2s to merge in a subsequent LEFT swipe (next move), creating a 4 and gaining score. This setup is strategic for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN move positions two 2s in the same row (row 3), enabling a potential merge in the next move. This is the most advantageous option.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to maximize merging opportunities and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|2|4  \nRow 3: 0|0|2|2  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Rows 0 and 1 remain unchanged (all zeros).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,2,4] shifts left to [2,4,0,0] (no merging).  \n   - Row 3: [0,0,2,2] shifts left, merging the two 2s into 4 → [4,0,0,0].  \n   - Result: Score +4. New tiles will appear in empty spots, but no adjacent large tiles are created.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Rows 0 and 1 remain unchanged (all zeros).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,2,4] shifts right to [0,0,2,4] (no merging).  \n   - Row 3: [0,0,2,2] shifts right, merging the two 2s into 4 → [0,0,0,4].  \n   - Result: Score +4. No adjacent large tiles are created.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns 0 and 1 remain unchanged (all zeros).  \n   - Column 2: [0,0,2,2] shifts up, merging the two 2s into 4 → [4,0,0,0].  \n   - Column 3: [0,0,4,2] shifts up to [4,2,0,0] (no merging).  \n   - Result: Score +4. The top row becomes [0,0,4,4], but these 4s are in the top row, which is less strategic for future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns 0 and 1 remain unchanged (all zeros).  \n   - Column 2: [0,0,2,2] shifts down, merging the two 2s into 4 → [0,0,0,4].  \n   - Column 3: [0,0,4,2] shifts down to [0,0,2,4] (no merging).  \n   - Result: Score +4. The bottom row becomes [0,0,4,4], with two adjacent 4s in the corner. This positions larger tiles in a corner (a key strategy) and creates immediate merging potential for future moves.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping DOWN results in two adjacent 4s in the bottom row, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and creating opportunities for future merges. This is the most optimal move.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate their potential to merge tiles and build towards higher values strategically.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 3: 0|0|4|2  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: All zeros, no change.  \n- Row 1: [2,0,0,0] → [2,0,0,0] (no movement).  \n- Row 2: [0,0,0,4] → [4,0,0,0] (4 shifts left).  \n- Row 3: [0,0,4,2] → [4,2,0,0] (4 and 2 shift left, no merge).  \nResult: Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. The 4 in Row 2 (Column 0) and 4 in Row 3 (Column 0) are vertically adjacent, which could merge with a subsequent UP move, but this requires a follow-up action.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: All zeros, no change.  \n- Row 1: [2,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,2] (2 shifts right).  \n- Row 2: [0,0,0,4] → [0,0,0,4] (no movement).  \n- Row 3: [0,0,4,2] → [0,0,4,2] (no movement, as 4 and 2 are already right-aligned).  \nResult: Only the 2 in Row 1 shifts right. No merges, and minimal strategic progress.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Column 0: [0,2,0,0] → [2,0,0,0] (2 shifts up to Row 0).  \n- Column 1: All zeros, no change.  \n- Column 2: [0,0,0,4] → [4,0,0,0] (4 shifts up to Row 0).  \n- Column 3: [0,0,4,2] → [4,2,0,0] (4 shifts up to Row 0, 2 shifts up to Row 1).  \nResult: After shifting up, Row 0 becomes [2,0,4,4]. The two 4s in Row 0 (Columns 2 and 3) are horizontally adjacent and can merge with a subsequent LEFT move, creating an 8 and earning 8 points. This aligns with the strategy of grouping larger tiles (4s) in a corner (top row) for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Column 0: [0,2,0,0] → [0,0,0,2] (2 shifts down to Row 3).  \n- Column 1: All zeros, no change.  \n- Column 2: [0,0,0,4] → [0,0,0,4] (no movement).  \n- Column 3: [0,0,4,2] → [0,0,4,2] (no movement, as 4 and 2 are already bottom-aligned).  \nResult: Only the 2 in Row 1 shifts down. No merges, and no clear path for future high-value merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe UP move positions two 4s in Row 0 (Columns 2 and 3), which can be merged with a subsequent LEFT move to form an 8. This aligns with the strategy of grouping tiles in a corner for strategic merging.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, maximizing score, and positioning larger tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 2|0|4|4  \nRow 1: 0|2|0|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [2, 0, 4, 4] shift left.

This is not ideal as it wastes an opportunity to combine tiles.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Swiping right shifts tiles to the rightmost positions.  \n   - Row 0: [0,0,2,8] → [0,0,2,8] (no movement, as tiles are already right-aligned).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,2,4] → [0,0,2,4] (no movement).  \n   **Outcome**: No tiles move. This is an invalid move.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Swiping up shifts tiles upward and merges adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Column 2 (tiles [2,2,0,0]): Tiles shift up and merge into 4 (score +4).  \n   - Column 3 (tiles [8,4,0,0]): Tiles shift up but do not merge (8 and 4 are different).  \n   **Resulting Grid**:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|4|8  \n   Row 1: 0|0|0|4  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   While merging occurs, the merged 4 and existing 8\/4 are spread across the top rows, which is less strategic for future moves.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Swiping down shifts tiles downward and merges adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Column 2 (tiles [2,2,0,0]): Tiles shift down to [0,0,2,2], then merge into 4 (score +4).  \n   - Column 3 (tiles [8,4,0,0]): Tiles shift down to [0,0,4,8] (no merge).  \n   **Resulting Grid**:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|4  \n   Row 3: 0|0|4|8  \n   ```  \n   This consolidates larger tiles (4 and 8) in the bottom row, with 8 in the bottom-right corner—a strategic position for future merges. Empty rows at the top provide flexibility for subsequent moves.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move, as it merges tiles for immediate score gain and positions larger tiles in a corner, optimizing long-term strategy.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

However, LEFT concentrates larger tiles (8s) in the left column, creating opportunities for future merges (e.g., swiping UP next to merge the 8s in Row 2 and Row 3).

UP and DOWN provide no immediate merges and are suboptimal.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|0|8\nRow 1: 16|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 2|0|0|0\n```\nKey observations:\n- Row 0 has two 8s separated by empty tiles, which can merge if shifted left or right.\n- Row 1 has a 16 in the first column, with empty tiles to the right.\n- Row 3 has a 2 in the first column, with empty tiles to the right.\n- The goal is to merge tiles to maximize scores and keep larger tiles in a corner.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### **UP\/DOWN Moves**:\n- **UP**: Shifting tiles upward does not cause any merges (no adjacent equal tiles in columns). The board remains nearly unchanged, with minimal benefit.\n- **DOWN**: Shifting tiles downward also does not cause merges. Tiles shift to the bottom of columns but do not combine, leaving the board in a less strategic state.\n\n\n#### **LEFT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: [8,0,0,8] → Shifting left merges the two 8s into 16 (score +16). The row becomes [16,0,0,0].\n- **Row 1**: [16,0,0,0] → Shifting left moves the 16 to the first column, resulting in [16,0,0,0].\n- **Row 3**: [2,0,0,0] → Shifting left moves the 2 to the first column, resulting in [2,0,0,0].\n- **Resulting Board**: \n  ```\n  16|0|0|0\n  16|0|0|0\n  0|0|0|0\n  2|0|0|0\n  ```\n- Strategic Benefit: The two 16s in column 0 (rows 0 and 1) are vertically adjacent, setting up a future merge (e.g., moving UP would merge them into 32). Larger tiles (16s) are concentrated in the left column (a corner), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: [8,0,0,8] → Shifting right merges the two 8s into 16 (score +16). The row becomes [0,0,0,16].\n- **Row 1**: [16,0,0,0] → Shifting right moves the 16 to the last column, resulting in [0,0,0,16].\n- **Row 3**: [2,0,0,0] → Shifting right moves the 2 to the last column, resulting in [0,0,0,2].\n- **Resulting Board**: \n  ```\n  0|0|0|16\n  0|0|0|16\n  0|0|0|0\n  0|0|0|2\n  ```\n- Strategic Benefit: The two 16s in column 3 (rows 0 and 1) are vertically adjacent, setting up a future merge (e.g., moving DOWN would merge them into 32). However, the 2 is now in the bottom-right corner, which is less ideal as small tiles should avoid blocking large tiles in corners.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT moves merge the 8s and set up future 16 merges. However, LEFT keeps the 16 from row 1 (original) in the left column, concentrating larger tiles in the left corner. This aligns better with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner and facilitates future merges (e.g., moving UP to merge the two 16s in column 0).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, score gain, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 16|0|0|8\nRow 1: 16|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 2|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Tiles shift left in each row. No merges occur (16 and 8 in Row 0 are distinct; other rows have no adjacent equal tiles). Score gain: 0. The board becomes:\n   ```\n   16|8|0|0\n   16|0|0|0\n   0|0|0|0\n   2|0|0|0\n   ```\n   No strategic advantage; larger tiles are not consolidated.\n\n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right in each row.

The board becomes:\n   ```\n   0|0|16|8\n   0|0|0|16\n   0|0|0|0\n   0|0|0|2\n   ```\n   No strategic advantage; larger tiles are spread out.\n\n3. **UP**: Tiles shift upward in each column. Key column analysis:\n   - **Column 0**: Tiles [16, 16, 0, 2] shift up. The two 16s merge into 32 (score gain: 32), and the 2 shifts up. Result: [32, 2, 0, 0].\n   - **Column 3**: Tiles [8, 0, 0, 2] shift up (no merges). Result: [8, 2, 0, 0].\n   Other columns (1 and 2) remain empty. The board after merging (before new tile) is:\n   ```\n   32|0|0|8\n   2|0|0|2\n   0|0|0|0\n   0|0|0|0\n   ```\n   The 32 (merged from 16s) is positioned in the top-left corner, a strategic corner for future merges.\n\n4. **DOWN**: Tiles shift downward in each column. Key column analysis:\n   - **Column 0**: Tiles [16, 16, 0, 2] shift down. The two 16s merge into 32 (score gain: 32), and the 2 remains at the bottom. Result: [0, 0, 32, 2].\n   - **Column 3**: Tiles [8, 0, 0, 2] shift down (no merges). Result: [0, 0, 8, 2].\n   Other columns (1 and 2) remain empty. The board after merging (before new tile) is:\n   ```\n   0|0|0|0\n   0|0|0|0\n   32|0|0|8\n   2|0|0|2\n   ```\n   The 32 is positioned in the middle-left, not a corner, which is less strategic.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move. It merges the two 16s into 32 (gaining 32 points) and positions the 32 in the top-left corner, a strategic corner for future merges. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to position tiles for future merges and keep larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 0 | 0 | 8\nRow 1: 2 | 16 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift left, resulting in `32 | 8 | 0 | 0` (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: Tiles shift left, resulting in `2 | 16 | 0 | 0` (no merge).  \n   - Rows 2 and 3 remain empty.  \n   - After the move, the 32 (largest tile) stays in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and the 8 in Row 0, Column 1 is positioned to potentially merge with a new 8 tile (since new tiles are 2 or 4, 8s can form via merging 4s, but this setup allows for future 8-8 merges if a new 8 appears in Row 0, Column 3).  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift right, resulting in `0 | 0 | 32 | 8` (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: Tiles shift right, resulting in `0 | 0 | 2 | 16` (no merge).  \n   - The 32 moves to Row 0, Column 2, which is not a corner, making it harder to protect.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns shift up. Row 0 becomes `32 | 16 | 0 | 8`, and Row 1 becomes `2 | 0 | 0 | 0`.  \n   - The 32 remains in the top-left corner, but the 16 in Row 0, Column 1 is isolated, with no immediate potential for merging (new tiles are 2\/4, not 16).  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns shift down. Row 2 becomes `32 | 0 | 0 | 0`, and Row 3 becomes `2 | 16 | 0 | 8`.  \n   - The 32 moves to Row 2, Column 0 (not a corner), reducing its strategic value.  \n\n\n### Optimal Move:\nMoving **LEFT** keeps the largest tile (32) in the top-left corner and positions the 8 in Row 0, Column 1. This setup increases the likelihood of future merges (e.g., if a new 8 appears in Row 0, Column 3, a subsequent left swipe would merge the two 8s into 16). This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners and setting up for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging rules:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 32 | 8 | 4 | 0  \nRow 1: 2 | 16 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles in each row shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal numbers).  \n   - Row 0 remains `32|8|4|0` (already left-aligned).  \n   - Row 1 remains `2|16|0|0` (already left-aligned).  \n   - No meaningful change; minimal strategic benefit.  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles in each row shift right, but no merges occur.  \n   - Row 0 becomes `0|32|8|4` (tiles shifted right).  \n   - Row 1 becomes `0|0|2|16` (tiles shifted right).  \n   - While tiles are grouped right, no immediate merges are enabled, and this does not align with the strategy of consolidating larger tiles in a corner.  \n\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles in each column shift up. Columns 0-3 already have tiles as high as possible (no empty spaces above them).  \n   - No movement or merges occur.  \n   - **Invalid move** (no tiles shift or merge).  \n\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles in each column shift down, consolidating them at the bottom:  \n     - Column 0 (32, 2, 0, 0) → `0|0|32|2` (tiles shifted down).  \n     - Column 1 (8, 16, 0, 0) → `0|0|8|16` (tiles shifted down).  \n     - Column 2 (4, 0, 0, 0) → `0|0|0|4` (tile shifted down).  \n     - Column 3 remains all 0s.  \n   - Resulting board after moving down:  \n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 32|8|0|0  \n     Row 3: 2|16|4|0  \n   - This consolidates larger tiles (32, 8, 16) in the lower rows, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nDOWN is the best move, as it consolidates tiles at the bottom, setting up for potential future merges and adhering to strategic tile placement.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (clustering larger tiles in a corner, enabling future merges).\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 32|8|0|0  \nRow 3: 2|16|4|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All non-zero tiles are already as far left as possible in their rows. No tiles shift or merge.  \n   - **Invalid**: No movement or merges occur.  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: All zeros (no change).  \n   - **Row 1**: [2,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,2] (2 shifts right).  \n   - **Row 2**: [32,8,0,0] → [0,0,32,8] (32 and 8 shift right).  \n   - **Row 3**: [2,16,4,0] → [0,2,16,4] (2, 16, 4 shift right).  \n   - **Result**: Tiles shift right, creating space on the left. Larger tiles (32, 8, 16, 4) cluster in the right half of rows 2 and 3, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner (bottom-right area).  \n   - **Valid**: Tiles move, and the new configuration supports future merges.  \n\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - **Column 0**: [0,2,32,2] → [2,32,2,0] (non-zero tiles shift up).  \n   - **Column 1**: [0,0,8,16] → [8,16,0,0] (non-zero tiles shift up).  \n   - **Column 2**: [0,0,0,4] → [4,0,0,0] (4 shifts up).  \n   - **Result**: Larger tiles (32, 16) end up in row 1, scattered rather than clustered. This reduces the potential for future merges compared to RIGHT.  \n   - **Valid**: Tiles move, but less optimal than RIGHT.  \n\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles remain in their original positions (no movement or merges).  \n   - **Invalid**: No movement occurs.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT is the best move. It clusters larger tiles (32, 8, 16, 4) in the bottom-right corner, facilitating future merges and aligning with strategic goals.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

The first two 8s merge to 16 (score +16), leaving `16,8,4,0`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `2,16,0,0` shift left to `2,16,0,0` (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `32,0,0,4` shift left to `32,4,0,0` (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `4,0,0,0` shift left to `4,0,0,0` (no merge).  \n- Result: Larger tiles (32, 16) are scattered, with limited future merge potential.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles `8,8,8,4` reverse to `4,8,8,8`, merge left to `4,16,8,0`, then reverse back to `0,8,16,4` (score +16).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `2,16,0,0` reverse to `16,2`, merge left to `16,2`, then reverse back to `0,0,2,16` (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `32,0,0,4` reverse to `4,32`, merge left to `4,32`, then reverse back to `0,0,32,4` (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `4,0,0,0` reverse to `4`, merge left to `4`, then reverse back to `0,0,0,4` (no merge).  \n- Result: Larger tiles (32, 16) are shifted right but not optimally positioned for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles `8,2,32,4` (all distinct) shift up with no merge.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles `8,16,0,0` (distinct) shift up to `8,16,0,0` (no merge).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles `8,0,0,0` shift up to `8,0,0,0` (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles `4,0,4,0` merge into 8 (score +8) when shifted up, resulting in `8,0,0,0`.  \n- Result: Row 0 becomes `8,8,8,8` (four 8s), creating a high-potential row for future left\/right swipes (e.g., swiping left next would merge all 8s into two 16s, yielding +32 score).  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles `8,2,32,4` (distinct) shift down with no merge.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles `8,16,0,0` shift down to `0,0,8,16` (no merge).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles `8,0,0,0` shift down to `0,0,0,8` (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles `4,0,4,0` merge into 8 (score +8) when shifted down, resulting in `0,0,0,8`.  \n- Result: Larger tiles (32, 16) are scattered, with limited immediate merge potential.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe UP swipe positions four 8s in Row 0, creating a strong setup for future merges (e.g., a subsequent left swipe would merge these 8s into two 16s). This strategic positioning of tiles aligns with the goal of maximizing scores and maintaining larger tiles in favorable positions.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|8|8|8  \nRow 1: 2|16|0|0  \nRow 2: 32|0|2|0  \nRow 3: 4|0|0|0  \n\n\n### **LEFT Swipe Analysis**  \n- **Row 0 (8|8|8|8):** Tiles shift left, merging adjacent 8s. First two 8s merge to 16 (score +16), next two 8s merge to 16 (score +16). Result: 16|16|0|0.  \n- **Row 1 (2|16|0|0):** Tiles shift left, no merges (2 and 16 are distinct). Result: 2|16|0|0.  \n- **Row 2 (32|0|2|0):** Tiles shift left, no merges (32 and 2 are distinct). Result: 32|2|0|0.  \n- **Row 3 (4|0|0|0):** Tiles shift left, no merges. Result: 4|0|0|0.  \n\nAfter LEFT, the board becomes:  \nRow 0: 16|16|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|16|0|0  \nRow 2: 32|2|0|0  \nRow 3: 4|0|0|0  \n\nKey advantage: The largest tile (32) remains in the left column (column 0), and merged 16s in row 0 are positioned to potentially merge again with future LEFT swipes. Larger tiles cluster on the left, aligning with the strategy of keeping big tiles in a corner.\n\n\n### **RIGHT Swipe Analysis**  \n- **Row 0 (8|8|8|8):** Tiles shift right, merging adjacent 8s. Last two 8s merge to 16 (score +16), next two 8s merge to 16 (score +16). Result: 0|0|16|16.  \n- **Row 1 (2|16|0|0):** Tiles shift right, no merges. Result: 0|0|2|16.  \n- **Row 2 (32|0|2|0):** Tiles shift right, no merges. Result: 0|0|32|2.  \n- **Row 3 (4|0|0|0):** Tiles shift right, no merges. Result: 0|0|0|4.  \n\nAfter RIGHT, the board becomes:  \nRow 0: 0|0|16|16  \nRow 1: 0|0|2|16  \nRow 2: 0|0|32|2  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|4  \n\nKey drawback: The largest tile (32) moves to column 2, and merged 16s in row 0 are on the right, spreading larger tiles instead of clustering them in a corner.\n\n\n### **UP Swipe Analysis**  \nTiles shift upward, but no merges occur (all vertical tiles are distinct). The board remains nearly unchanged, with no score gain. This is not optimal.\n\n\n### **DOWN Swipe Analysis**  \nTiles shift downward, but no merges occur (all vertical tiles are distinct). The board remains nearly unchanged, with no score gain. This is not optimal.\n\n\n### Conclusion  \nLEFT swipe maximizes score (32) and strategically clusters larger tiles (16s, 32) in the left column, aligning with the goal of keeping big tiles in a corner for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given game board:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|16|0|0\nRow 1: 2|16|0|0\nRow 2: 32|2|0|0\nRow 3: 4|0|0|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: 16 and 16 merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in `32|0|0|0`.  \n   - Rows 1-3: Tiles shift left but no merges (e.g., Row 1 becomes `2|16|0|0`).  \n   - Outcome: 32 in Row 0, left, but no further merge opportunities in subsequent moves.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: 16 and 16 merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in `0|0|0|32`.  \n   - Rows 1-3: Tiles shift right but no merges (e.g., Row 1 becomes `0|0|2|16`).  \n   - Outcome: 32 in Row 0, right, but no strategic setup for larger merges.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 1: 16 (Row 0) and 16 (Row 1) merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in `32` in Row 0, Column 1.  \n   - Other columns: Tiles shift up with no merges (e.g., Column 0 remains `16|2|32|4`).  \n   - Outcome: 32 in Row 0, Column 1, but Row 1 has `2|2|0|0` (small merge potential, not impactful).  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 1: 16 (Row 0) and 16 (Row 1) shift down, merging into 32 (score +32) in Row 2, Column 1.  \n   - Row 2: After merging, Row 2 becomes `32|32|0|0` (adjacent 32s, which can merge into 64 in the next move if swiped LEFT).  \n   - Other columns: Tiles shift down with no merges (e.g., Column 0 remains `16|2|32|4`).  \n   - Outcome: Strategic setup for a 64 merge in the next move, maximizing future score potential.  \n\n\nThe **DOWN** move is optimal because it merges the 16s in Column 1 into 32 (score +32) and positions two 32s in Row 2, setting up a high-value 64 merge in the next move. This aligns with the strategy of grouping larger tiles to enable future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the effect of each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 2 | 4 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 32 | 32 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 4 | 2 | 0 | 8  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [16, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift left, no merges. Result: [16, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 1**: [2, 4, 0, 0] → Tiles shift left, no merges. Result: [2, 4, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 32, 0, 0] → Tiles shift left and merge (32 + 32 = 64). Result: [64, 0, 0, 0]. Score gain: 64.  \n- **Row 3**: [4, 2, 0, 8] → Tiles shift left (4, 2, 8), no merges. Result: [4, 2, 8, 0].  \n\nAfter LEFT swipe, the board becomes:  \nRow 0: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 2 | 4 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 64 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 4 | 2 | 8 | 0  \n\nLarger tiles (16, 64) are concentrated on the left edge, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [16, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right. Result: [0, 0, 0, 16].  \n- **Row 1**: [2, 4, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right. Result: [0, 0, 2, 4].  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 32, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right and merge (32 + 32 = 64). Result: [0, 0, 0, 64]. Score gain: 64.  \n- **Row 3**: [4, 2, 0, 8] → Tiles shift right (4, 2, 8). Result: [0, 4, 2, 8].  \n\nAfter RIGHT swipe, the board becomes:  \nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 16  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 2 | 4  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 64  \nRow 3: 0 | 4 | 2 | 8  \n\nLarger tiles (16, 64) are on the right edge, but this scatters them compared to LEFT.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed vertically. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges. Tiles shift up but remain unmerged. No score gain. This is suboptimal.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed vertically. All tiles are already as far down as possible, and no adjacent equal tiles exist. No movement or merges occur. This is an invalid move.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge 32s into 64 (gaining 64 points). However, LEFT concentrates larger tiles (16, 64) on the left edge, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner for future merges. UP and DOWN are suboptimal (no merges or invalid).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to position larger tiles strategically (preferably in corners) and create opportunities for future merges.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|0|0|0\nRow 1: 2|4|0|32\nRow 2: 64|0|0|0\nRow 3: 4|2|8|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 16|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 2|4|32|0  \n   Row 2: 64|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 4|2|8|0  \n   ```  \n   No merges, and larger tiles (16, 32, 64) are scattered without clear corner alignment.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, with no merges. The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|16  \n   Row 1: 0|2|4|32  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|64  \n   Row 3: 0|4|2|8  \n   ```  \n   Larger tiles (16, 32, 64) align vertically in the rightmost column (column 3), occupying rows 0, 1, and 2 respectively. This positions them in a corner (right column) with increasing values (16 < 32 < 64), which is strategic for future merges (e.g., if another 64 appears in row 3, column 3, a UP swipe could merge them).\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up, with no merges. The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 16|4|8|32  \n   Row 1: 2|2|0|0  \n   Row 2: 64|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 4|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   While row 0 has a sequence (16, 4, 8, 32), the larger tile 64 remains in row 2, column 0, and there are no clear corner alignments for future merges.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down, with no merges. The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 16|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 2|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 64|4|0|0  \n   Row 3: 4|2|8|32  \n   ```  \n   Larger tiles (16, 64, 32) are scattered, with no consistent corner alignment, reducing strategic potential.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping RIGHT positions the largest tiles (16, 32, 64) in the rightmost column, creating a corner-aligned sequence (16 < 32 < 64). This setup is optimal for future merges and strategic growth.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile placement. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 1: 0|2|4|32  \nRow 2: 0|32|0|64  \nRow 3: 0|4|2|8  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,0,16] → Shifts to [16,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,2,4,32] → Shifts to [2,4,32,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,32,0,64] → Shifts to [32,64,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,4,2,8] → Shifts to [4,2,8,0] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges. The 16 in Row 0 moves left, disrupting the right-column cluster of larger tiles (16, 32, 64, 8).  \n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,0,16] → No change (16 stays in the rightmost position).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,2,4,32] → No change (2, 4, 32 are already right-aligned).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,32,0,64] → Shifts to [0,0,32,64] (no merges; 32 and 64 stay right-aligned).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,4,2,8] → No change (4, 2, 8 are already right-aligned).  \n- **Result**: No merges. The right column retains the largest tiles (16, 32, 64, 8), preserving the corner cluster.  \n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: All zeros (no change).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,2,32,4] → Shifts to [2,32,4,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,4,0,2] → Shifts to [4,2,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [16,32,64,8] → No change (all distinct, no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges. The right-column cluster (16, 32, 64, 8) remains, but smaller tiles are scattered upward, reducing future merging potential.  \n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: All zeros (no change).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,2,32,4] → No change (tiles remain right-aligned).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,4,0,2] → Shifts to [0,0,4,2] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [16,32,64,8] → No change (all distinct, no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges. The right-column cluster is preserved, but tiles are spread out vertically, limiting strategic alignment.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe key strategy is to keep larger tiles in a corner to facilitate future merges. The right column currently contains the largest tiles (16, 32, 64, 8). Swiping RIGHT preserves this cluster by leaving the right-aligned tiles undisturbed, maintaining their position in the corner. Other directions either disrupt this cluster (LEFT) or fail to optimize alignment (UP, DOWN).  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|4|16  \nRow 1: 0|2|4|32  \nRow 2: 0|0|32|64  \nRow 3: 0|4|2|8  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur. Score: 0.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur. Score: 0.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift upward, merging vertically. Key observation: Column 2 (rows 0 and 1) has two `4`s. When swiping up, these `4`s merge into an `8` (score +8). Additionally, after merging:  \n   - Column 1 (rows 0 and 1) shifts to `2` and `4` (no merge).  \n   - Column 3 remains unchanged (no merges).  \n   Post-merge, Row 1 becomes `0|4|32|32`, creating adjacent `32`s in columns 2 and 3. This sets up a future merge opportunity (e.g., a RIGHT swipe could merge these `32`s into `64`).  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift downward, merging vertically. Column 2 (rows 0 and 1) has two `4`s, which merge into an `8` (score +8). However, after merging:  \n   - Column 1 shifts to `0|0|2|4` (no merge).  \n   - Column 3 remains unchanged (no merges).  \n   No adjacent large tiles are set up for future merges, unlike the UP swipe.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe merges the `4`s (scoring 8) and strategically positions `32`s adjacently in Row 1, enabling future merges. This is better than other directions, which either score nothing or fail to set up future opportunities.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging potential:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 2 | 8 | 16  \nRow 1: 0 | 4 | 32 | 32  \nRow 2: 32 | 0 | 2 | 64  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 8  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0, 2, 8, 16] → Shifts to [2, 8, 16, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 4, 32, 32] → Shifts to [4, 32, 32, 0], then merges 32s into 64 → [4, 64, 0, 0] (score +64).  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 0, 2, 64] → Shifts to [32, 2, 64, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 0, 8] → Shifts to [8, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n**Result**: Larger tiles (64, 32, 16) are spread across rows but not aligned to a corner.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0, 2, 8, 16] → Shifts to [0, 2, 8, 16] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 4, 32, 32] → Shifts to [0, 4, 0, 64] (merges 32s into 64, score +64).  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 0, 2, 64] → Shifts to [0, 32, 2, 64] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 0, 8] → Shifts to [0, 0, 0, 8] (no merges).  \n**Result**: Larger tiles (16, 64, 64, 8) are aligned to the right edge, concentrating them in the right column—a strategic corner for future merges.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed top to bottom. No merges occur, as all tiles in columns are distinct or non-adjacent. Tiles shift up but remain unmerged.  \n**Result**: No score gain, and tiles are not strategically positioned.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed bottom to top. No merges occur, as tiles in columns are distinct or non-adjacent.

The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up favorable positions for future moves.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|2|8|16\nRow 1: 0|32|4|128\nRow 2: 0|0|2|8\nRow 3: 16|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `16|2|8|16` have no zeros to shift into, so no change.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `0|32|4|128` shift left to `32|4|128|0` (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles `0|0|2|8` shift left to `2|8|0|0` (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles `16|0|0|0` remain `16|0|0|0` (no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges, score gain = 0.\n\n#### **RIGHT**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `16|2|8|16` have no zeros to the right, so no change.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `0|32|4|128` have no zeros to the right, so no change.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles `0|0|2|8` have no zeros to the right, so no change.\n- **Row 3**: Tiles `16|0|0|0` shift right to `0|0|0|16` (no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges, score gain = 0.\n\n#### **UP**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles `16 (Row 0), 0 (Row 1), 0 (Row 2), 16 (Row 3)` shift up. Non-zero tiles `16, 16` merge into `32` (Row 0).  \n- **Other Columns**: No merges (tiles are distinct or non-adjacent).  \n**Result**: Merges 16 + 16 → 32, score gain = 32. New board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 32|2|8|16\n  Row 1: 0|32|4|128\n  Row 2: 0|0|2|8\n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0\n  ```\n\n#### **DOWN**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles `16 (Row 0), 0 (Row 1), 0 (Row 2), 16 (Row 3)` shift down. Non-zero tiles `16, 16` merge into `32` (Row 3).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles `2 (Row 0), 32 (Row 1), 0 (Row 2), 0 (Row 3)` shift down to `0|0|2|32` (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles `8 (Row 0), 4 (Row 1), 2 (Row 2), 0 (Row 3)` shift down to `0|8|4|2` (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles `16 (Row 0), 128 (Row 1), 8 (Row 2), 0 (Row 3)` shift down to `0|16|128|8` (no merges).  \n**Result**: Merges 16 + 16 → 32, score gain = 32.

After DOWN, Row 3 has adjacent 32s (Columns 0 and 1), which can merge into 64 on a subsequent LEFT move. Additionally, the 128 tile (Row 2, Column 3) is positioned to move to the bottom-right corner (Row 3, Column 3) with a future DOWN move, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

The goal is to merge tiles for higher scores and maintain strategic positioning (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 64 | 8\nRow 1: 0 | 16 | 8 | 16\nRow 2: 0 | 2 | 4 | 128\nRow 3: 0 | 64 | 2 | 8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0 shifts to `[64, 8, 0, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1 shifts to `[16, 8, 16, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2 shifts to `[2, 4, 128, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3 shifts to `[64, 2, 8, 0]` (no merges).  \n   - No merges occur.

UP is preferable because it keeps the 128 (the largest tile) in the corner (Row 2, Column 3), aligning with the strategy of maintaining large tiles in corners for future merges. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to identify potential merges and strategic tile alignment. The goal is to maximize immediate score and position larger tiles for future merges.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 16 | 64 | 8\nRow 1: 0 | 2 | 8 | 16\nRow 2: 0 | 64 | 4 | 128\nRow 3: 32 | 0 | 2 | 8\n```\n\n### LEFT Swipe:\n- Each row shifts left, but no adjacent tiles are equal. No merges occur. Score: 0.\n\n### RIGHT Swipe:\n- Each row shifts right, but no adjacent tiles are equal. No merges occur. Score: 0.\n\n### UP Swipe:\n- Columns shift up, but no adjacent tiles are equal. No merges occur. Score: 0.\n\n### DOWN Swipe:\n- Columns shift down. For the rightmost column (column 3), the tiles are `[8, 16, 128, 8]` (rows 0-3). When shifting down:\n  - The top 8 (row 0) moves down past 16 (row 1) and 128 (row 2) to merge with the 8 in row 3. This creates a 16 in row 3, column 3.\n  - The 16 (row 1) shifts down to row 2, column 3.\n  - The 128 (row 2) shifts down to row 1, column 3.\n  - Row 0, column 3 becomes 0.\n\nThis results in a merge of two 8s into a 16, yielding a score of 16. The merged 16 in row 3, column 3 also aligns larger tiles (128, 16) in the bottom-right area, supporting future strategic merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN swipe is the only direction with an immediate merge, providing a score of 16 and better positioning of larger tiles.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize potential merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 2 | 64 | 8\nRow 1: 0 | 16 | 8 | 16\nRow 2: 0 | 2 | 4 | 128\nRow 3: 32 | 64 | 2 | 8\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **Swipe Right**:  \n   Tiles shift to the right. No merges occur because no adjacent equal tiles align after shifting. Additionally, no tiles move into empty spaces (all non-zero tiles are already right-aligned). **Invalid move** (no movement).\n\n2. **Swipe Down**:  \n   Tiles shift downward. No merges occur, and no tiles move into empty spaces (all non-zero tiles are already bottom-aligned). **Invalid move** (no movement).\n\n3. **Swipe Up**:  \n   Tiles shift upward. The 32 in Row 3, Column 0 moves up to Row 0, Column 0. No other tiles merge, but this move is valid (tiles move into empty spaces). However, no immediate or obvious future merges are set up.\n\n4. **Swipe Left**:  \n   Tiles shift to the left. Non-zero tiles move into empty spaces, and while no merges occur immediately, this move strategically positions tiles for future merges:  \n   - Row 0: [0, 2, 64, 8] → [2, 64, 8, 0] (2 moves left into the empty space).  \n   - Row 1: [0, 16, 8, 16] → [16, 8, 16, 0] (16 moves left into the empty space).  \n   - Row 2: [0, 2, 4, 128] → [2, 4, 128, 0] (2 moves left into the empty space).  \n   - Row 3: No movement (no empty spaces).  \n\n   Notably, Row 1 now has 16s at Columns 0 and 2 (with 8 in between). A subsequent right swipe could align these 16s to merge into 32, creating a future scoring opportunity. This setup makes left the better choice.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwipe Left is the optimal move, as it positions tiles to enable future merges (e.g., the 16s in Row 1) while maintaining strategic tile placement.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning of large tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 64 | 8 | 16\nRow 1: 16 | 8 | 16 | 0\nRow 2: 2 | 4 | 128 | 0\nRow 3: 32 | 64 | 2 | 8\n```\nKey observations:\n- The largest tile is 128 (row 2, column 2).\n- Empty tiles (0s) are in row 1, column 3 and row 2, column 3.\n- No adjacent tiles of the same value exist (no immediate merges possible).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left. Rows 0 and 3 have no empty spaces, so they remain unchanged. Rows 1 and 2 already have tiles shifted left (empty spaces on the right), so no movement occurs. No merges, and no meaningful tile repositioning. Not optimal.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, filling empty spaces on the right.  \n   - Row 1: `16 | 8 | 16 | 0` → `0 | 16 | 8 | 16` (tiles shift right, 0 moves to column 0).  \n   - Row 2: `2 | 4 | 128 | 0` → `0 | 2 | 4 | 128` (128 moves to column 3, the right edge).  \n   - Rows 0 and 3 have no empty spaces, so they remain unchanged.  \n   This move positions the 128 tile at the right edge (row 2, column 3), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up. Columns 0-2 have no empty spaces to enable meaningful movement. Column 3: `16 | 0 | 0 | 8` → `16 | 8 | 0 | 0` (8 moves up to row 1). No merges, and the 128 tile remains in the middle. Less strategic than RIGHT.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down. Columns 0-2 have no empty spaces to enable meaningful movement. Column 3: `16 | 0 | 0 | 8` → `0 | 0 | 16 | 8` (16 moves down to row 2). No merges, and the 128 tile remains in the middle. Less strategic than RIGHT.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT repositions the 128 tile to the right edge (row 2, column 3), which aligns with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in corners. This move is the most strategic.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges, score gain, and strategic placement of larger tiles (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 64 | 8 | 16\nRow 1: 0 | 16 | 8 | 16\nRow 2: 4 | 2 | 4 | 128\nRow 3: 32 | 64 | 2 | 8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Move**:\n- All rows have no merges (no adjacent equal tiles) and minimal shifting (only Row 1 shifts left but without merging). No score gain. Not useful.\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- Similar to LEFT: no merges occur in any row, as tiles are either non-adjacent or distinct. No score gain. Not useful.\n\n#### **UP Move**:\n- **Column 2** (values: 8, 8, 4, 2): The top two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). Tiles shift up, resulting in [16, 4, 2, 0].\n- **Column 3** (values: 16, 16, 128, 8): The top two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). Tiles shift up, resulting in [32, 128, 8, 0].\n- Total score gain: 16 + 32 = 48. However, the largest tile (128) moves from Row 2, Column 3 to Row 1, Column 3 (no longer in the bottom-right corner).\n\n#### **DOWN Move**:\n- **Column 2** (values: 8, 8, 4, 2): The bottom two 8s (after shifting down) merge into 16 (score +16). Tiles shift down, resulting in [0, 16, 4, 2].\n- **Column 3** (values: 16, 16, 128, 8): The bottom two 16s (after shifting down) merge into 32 (score +32). Tiles shift down, resulting in [0, 32, 128, 8].\n- Total score gain: 16 + 32 = 48. Importantly, the largest tile (128) remains in the bottom-right corner (Row 2, Column 3), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and DOWN yield the same score, but DOWN preserves the 128 tile in the bottom-right corner, which is strategically better for future merges. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for possible merges and strategic tile alignment when swiping left, right, up, or down.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0 | 64 | 2 | 0  \nRow 1: 2 | 16 | 16 | 32  \nRow 2: 4 | 2 | 4 | 128  \nRow 3: 32 | 64 | 2 | 8  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: [0, 64, 2, 0] → Shifts to [64, 2, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - **Row 1**: [2, 16, 16, 32] → The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in [2, 32, 32, 0].  \n   - **Row 2**: [4, 2, 4, 128] → Shifts to [4, 2, 4, 128] (no merges).  \n   - **Row 3**: [32, 64, 2, 8] → Shifts to [32, 64, 2, 8] (no merges).  \n   - **Key Outcome**: Row 1 gains two adjacent 32s, setting up for a future merge (e.g., another LEFT swipe would merge them into 64).  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: [0, 64, 2, 0] → Shifts to [0, 0, 64, 2] (no merges).  \n   - **Row 1**: [2, 16, 16, 32] → The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in [0, 2, 32, 32].  \n   - **Row 2**: [4, 2, 4, 128] → Shifts to [4, 2, 4, 128] (no merges).  \n   - **Row 3**: [32, 64, 2, 8] → Shifts to [32, 64, 2, 8] (no merges).  \n   - **Key Outcome**: Row 1 gains two adjacent 32s on the right, but future merges would require a RIGHT swipe, which is less strategic than aligning tiles to the left.  \n\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed upward, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. No merges occur.  \n\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed downward, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. No merges occur.  \n\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nLEFT swipe is optimal because it merges the 16s in Row 1 into 32 (scoring 32) and aligns the resulting 32s to the left, setting up for a future merge (e.g., another LEFT swipe would merge the 32s into 64). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and enabling sequential merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate potential merges and tile positioning for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

Tiles shift right but remain unmerged (e.g., Row 0: `0, 0, 64, 2`; Row 1: `8, 2, 64, 16`; Row 2: `4, 2, 4, 128`; Row 3: `32, 64, 2, 8`).  \n- No score gain. Poor choice.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed top to bottom:  \n  - **Column 1** (0, 2, 2, 64): Merges two 2s into 4 (score +4).  \n  - **Column 2** (64, 64, 4, 2): Merges two 64s into 128 (score +128).  \n  - Other columns have no merges.  \n- Resulting board (after merges and shifts):  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 8 | 4 | 128 | 2  \n  Row 1: 4 | 64 | 4 | 16  \n  Row 2: 32 | 0 | 2 | 128  \n  Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 8  \n  ```\n- Total score gain: 132. Larger tiles (e.g., 128) are in the top row, which is suboptimal for corner strategy.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed bottom to top:  \n  - **Column 1** (0, 2, 2, 64): Merges two 2s into 4 (score +4).  \n  - **Column 2** (64, 64, 4, 2): Merges two 64s into 128 (score +128).  \n  - Other columns have no merges.  \n- Resulting board (after merges and shifts):  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 2  \n  Row 1: 8 | 0 | 0 | 16  \n  Row 2: 4 | 4 | 4 | 128  \n  Row 3: 32 | 64 | 128 | 8  \n  ```\n- Total score gain: 132. Larger tiles (e.g., 128) are in the bottom row, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner. Additionally, Row 2 has three 4s, which can be merged in future moves (e.g., swiping left).\n\n### Conclusion:  \nBoth UP and DOWN yield the same score, but DOWN positions larger tiles in the bottom row (closer to a corner) and leaves three 4s in Row 2 for future merges. Thus, DOWN is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|2\nRow 1: 8|16|128|16\nRow 2: 4|4|4|128\nRow 3: 32|64|2|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   - **Row 0**: `[0,0,0,2]` shifts left to `[2,0,0,0]` (no merges).  \n   - **Row 1**: `[8,16,128,16]` has no adjacent equal tiles and no empty spaces, so it remains unchanged.  \n   - **Row 2**: `[4,4,4,128]` shifts left. The first two `4`s merge into `8` (score +8), and the remaining `4` shifts left, while the `128` shifts to column 2. Result: `[8,4,128,0]`.  \n   - **Row 3**: `[32,64,2,8]` has no adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces, so it remains unchanged.  \n   - **Key Outcome**: Column 2 now has `128` (Row 1) and `128` (Row 2), setting up a potential merge of `128`s in the next move (e.g., UP), which would create a `256` tile (high value).  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - **Row 0**: `[0,0,0,2]` shifts right (no change).  \n   - **Row 1**: `[8,16,128,16]` has no adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces, so it remains unchanged.  \n   - **Row 2**: `[4,4,4,128]` shifts right. The last two `4`s merge into `8` (score +8), but the `128` stays in column 3. Result: `[4,8,0,128]`.  \n   - **Row 3**: `[32,64,2,8]` has no adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces, so it remains unchanged.  \n   - **Key Outcome**: No significant setup for high-value merges compared to LEFT.  \n\n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom. Tiles shift up, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. No merges occur, and empty spaces are created in Row 3.  \n   - **Key Outcome**: No immediate merges; empty spaces are created but no strategic setup for high-value tiles.  \n\n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom to top. Tiles shift down, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. No merges occur, and the board remains nearly unchanged.  \n   - **Key Outcome**: No meaningful changes or strategic advantages.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe LEFT move is optimal because it merges two `4`s in Row 2 (scoring 8) and positions two `128`s in Column 2 (Row 1 and Row 2). This sets up a critical opportunity to merge the `128`s into a `256` tile with a subsequent UP move, a high-value strategic advantage.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 8|16|128|16  \nRow 2: 8|4|128|64  \nRow 3: 32|64|2|8  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: [2, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts left to [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- Row 1: [8, 16, 128, 16] → No adjacent duplicates; remains unchanged (no merges).  \n- Row 2: [8, 4, 128, 64] → No adjacent duplicates; remains unchanged (no merges).  \n- Row 3: [32, 64, 2, 8] → No adjacent duplicates; remains unchanged (no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges, minimal tile movement.

Larger tiles (256, 32, 64) are spread across lower rows, with row 0 empty for future tiles.\n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nBoth UP and DOWN yield the same score (272), but UP positions the 256 tile in row 0 (upper half), which aligns better with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner or upper edge for future merges. Thus, UP is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile positioning, and strategic placement of large tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 16 | 256 | 16\nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 2 | 64\nRow 2: 32 | 64 | 0 | 8\nRow 3: 0 | 128 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row).  \n   - Row 0 remains `[2, 16, 256, 16]` (no zeros to shift into).  \n   - Row 1 remains `[16, 4, 2, 64]` (no zeros).  \n   - Row 2 becomes `[32, 64, 8, 0]` (8 shifts left into the zero).  \n   - Row 3 becomes `[128, 0, 0, 0]` (128 shifts left).  \n   - No score gain, and large tiles (e.g., 256, 128) are not optimally positioned.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, with no merges (no adjacent equal tiles in any row).  \n   - Row 0 remains `[2, 16, 256, 16]` (no zeros to shift into).  \n   - Row 1 remains `[16, 4, 2, 64]` (no zeros).  \n   - Row 2 becomes `[0, 32, 64, 8]` (32, 64, 8 shift right into zeros).  \n   - Row 3 becomes `[0, 0, 0, 128]` (128 shifts right to the bottom-right corner).  \n   - No score gain, but the 128 tile moves to the bottom-right corner (a strategic corner for large tiles).\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift up, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any column).  \n   - Columns remain mostly unchanged, with minimal shifting (e.g., column 0: `[2, 16, 32, 0]` stays as is).  \n   - Large tiles (256, 128) remain in non-corner positions, limiting future merge potential.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any column).  \n   - Columns shift but do not meaningfully reposition large tiles (e.g., 128 stays in row 3, column 1; 256 moves to row 2, column 2).  \n   - No score gain, and large tiles are not moved to optimal corners.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe key strategy in 2048 is to cluster large tiles in corners to facilitate future merges. Swiping RIGHT moves the 128 tile to the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), a strong positional advantage. This aligns with the goal of keeping large tiles in corners, making it the best choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities and position larger tiles strategically (e.g., in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 16 | 256 | 16  \nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 2 | 64  \nRow 2: 0 | 32 | 64 | 8  \nRow 3: 0 | 64 | 0 | 128  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**:\n- Row 0: Tiles are already left-aligned (no zeros), so no change.  \n- Row 1: Tiles are left-aligned (no zeros), so no change.  \n- Row 2: `0|32|64|8` shifts left to `32|64|8|0` (no merges).  \n- Row 3: `0|64|0|128` shifts left to `64|128|0|0` (no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges, and 128 (the second-largest tile) is not in a corner.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**:\n- Row 0: Tiles are right-aligned (no zeros), so no change.  \n- Row 1: Tiles are right-aligned (no zeros), so no change.  \n- Row 2: `0|32|64|8` shifts right to `0|0|32|64|8` (no merges, but tiles shift right).  \n- Row 3: `0|64|0|128` shifts right to `0|0|64|128` (no merges).  \n- **Key Benefit**: The 128 tile moves to the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), a strategic corner for large tiles. This positions it to potentially merge with future tiles in subsequent moves.  \n\n#### **UP**:\n- Column 0: `2|16|0|0` shifts up to `2|16|0|0` (no merges).  \n- Column 1: `16|4|32|64` (all non-zero, no merges).  \n- Column 2: `256|2|64|0` shifts up to `256|2|64|0` (no merges).  \n- Column 3: `16|64|8|128` (all non-zero, no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges, and large tiles remain scattered.  \n\n#### **DOWN**:\n- Column 0: `2|16|0|0` shifts down to `0|0|2|16` (no merges).  \n- Column 1: `16|4|32|64` (all non-zero, no merges).  \n- Column 2: `256|2|64|0` shifts down to `0|256|2|64` (no merges).  \n- Column 3: `16|64|8|128` (all non-zero, no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges, and 128 remains in the bottom-right corner but is not optimized further.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSwipping **RIGHT** positions the 128 tile in the bottom-right corner, a strategic location for future merges. This move aligns with the goal of keeping larger tiles in corners to maximize long-term merging opportunities.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize score through tile merges and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 2 | 16 | 256 | 16  \nRow 1: 16 | 4 | 2 | 64  \nRow 2: 0 | 32 | 64 | 8  \nRow 3: 2 | 0 | 64 | 128  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur. Score remains unchanged.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur. Score remains unchanged.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward. In Column 2 (values: 256, 2, 64, 64), the two 64s in rows 2 and 3 merge into 128 (score +128). The resulting board has 256 in row 0, column 2; 128 in row 2, column 2; and 128 in row 3, column 3. No other merges occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward. In Column 2 (values: 256, 2, 64, 64), the two 64s in rows 2 and 3 merge into 128 (score +128). Additionally, in row 3 (after shifting), the merged 128 (column 2) and existing 128 (column 3) become adjacent horizontally. This sets up a future merge opportunity (e.g., swiping LEFT next could merge these 128s into 256).  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nWhile both UP and DOWN yield a 128 score from merging the 64s, DOWN positions two 128s adjacently in row 3. This creates a future merge opportunity (e.g., swiping LEFT to merge them into 256), which is more advantageous for long-term scoring.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize score through merging and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 0 | 0 | 16\nRow 1: 2 | 16 | 256 | 64\nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 2 | 8\nRow 3: 2 | 32 | 128 | 128\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **UP\/DOWN Swipes**:  \n   - UP: Columns are processed upward. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles shift into empty spaces but do not combine.  \n   - DOWN: Columns are processed downward. Similarly, no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles remain in place.  \n\n2. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift left to `128 | 16 | 0 | 0` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: All tiles are non-zero and distinct, so no change.  \n   - Row 2: All tiles are non-zero and distinct, so no change.  \n   - Row 3: The two `128` tiles merge into `256`, resulting in `2 | 32 | 256 | 0`. Score increases by `256`.  \n\n3. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift right to `0 | 0 | 128 | 16` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: All tiles are non-zero and distinct, so no change.  \n   - Row 2: All tiles are non-zero and distinct, so no change.  \n   - Row 3: The two `128` tiles merge into `256`, resulting in `0 | 2 | 32 | 256`. Score increases by `256`.  \n\n\n### Key Consideration: Tile Positioning  \nThe strategy emphasizes keeping larger tiles in corners for stability. After a RIGHT swipe, the merged `256` in Row 3, Column 3 (bottom-right corner) is positioned in a corner, which is ideal for future merges. In contrast, a LEFT swipe places the `256` in Row 3, Column 2 (not a corner). The RIGHT swipe better aligns with strategic tile placement.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities, tile positioning, and future strategy.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|128|128|16\nRow 1: 2|16|256|64\nRow 2: 16|4|2|8\nRow 3: 0|2|32|256\n```\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n#### **UP\/DOWN**:\n- **UP**: Columns are processed top-to-bottom. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles shift up but remain unmerged.  \n- **DOWN**: Columns are processed bottom-to-top. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles shift down but remain unmerged.  \n*Neither UP nor DOWN provides immediate merges or score gains.*\n\n#### **LEFT**:\n- **Row 0**: `0|128|128|16` → Tiles shift left. The two 128s merge into 256 (score +256), with 16 shifting left. Result: `256|16|0|0`.  \n- **Row 1**: `2|16|256|64` → All tiles are distinct; no merges.

Result: `2|32|256|0`.  \n*LEFT merges 128s in Row 0, gaining 256 points. However, the merged 256 (Row 0, Column 0) is isolated, with no adjacent large tiles for future merges.*\n\n#### **RIGHT**:\n- **Row 0**: `0|128|128|16` → Tiles shift right. The two 128s merge into 256 (score +256), with 16 shifting right. Result: `0|0|256|16`.  \n- **Row 1**: `2|16|256|64` → All tiles are distinct; no merges. Result: `2|16|256|64`.  \n- **Row 2**: `16|4|2|8` → All tiles are distinct; no merges. Result: `16|4|2|8`.  \n- **Row 3**: `0|2|32|256` → Tiles are already right-aligned; no changes. Result: `0|2|32|256`.  \n*RIGHT also merges 128s in Row 0, gaining 256 points. Notably, the merged 256 (Row 0, Column 2) is directly above the 256 in Row 1, Column 2. This vertical alignment sets up a potential future merge (e.g., via UP) for a 512 tile.*\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nRIGHT is superior because it aligns two 256s vertically (Row 0, Column 2 and Row 1, Column 2), creating a high-value merge opportunity in subsequent moves. LEFT isolates the merged 256 in a corner, limiting future merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, score gain, and strategic tile placement.\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: [0, 0, 256, 16] → Shifts to [256, 16, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [2, 16, 256, 64] → All distinct (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [16, 4, 2, 8] → All distinct (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: [64, 2, 32, 256] → All distinct (no merge).  \n**Result**: No merges, score gain = 0.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: [0, 0, 256, 16] → No shift (tiles already right-aligned).  \n- **Row 1**: [2, 16, 256, 64] → No shift (tiles already right-aligned).  \n- **Row 2**: [16, 4, 2, 8] → No shift (tiles already right-aligned).  \n- **Row 3**: [64, 2, 32, 256] → No shift (tiles already right-aligned).  \n**Result**: No merges, score gain = 0.\n\n### UP Move:\n- **Column 0**: [0, 2, 16, 64] → Shifts to [2, 16, 64, 0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 1**: [0, 16, 4, 2] → Shifts to [16, 4, 2, 0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 2**: [256, 256, 2, 32] → Merges 256 + 256 = 512 (score gain = 512). Remaining tiles [2, 32] shift up: [512, 2, 32, 0].  \n- **Column 3**: [16, 64, 8, 256] → All distinct (no merge).  \n**Result**: Merges two 256s into 512, score gain = 512. Larger tiles (512, 256) are positioned in the top-middle and bottom-right corner, respectively, leaving empty spaces in the bottom row for future moves.\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- **Column 0**: [0, 2, 16, 64] → No shift (tiles already bottom-aligned).  \n- **Column 1**: [0, 16, 4, 2] → No shift (tiles already bottom-aligned).  \n- **Column 2**: [256, 256, 2, 32] → Merges 256 + 256 = 512 (score gain = 512). Remaining tiles [2, 32] shift down: [0, 512, 2, 32].  \n- **Column 3**: [16, 64, 8, 256] → All distinct (no merge).  \n**Result**: Merges two 256s into 512, score gain = 512. However, the 512 is placed in row 1, column 2, and the bottom-right corner (256) remains, but the top row is left with more empty spaces, which may be less strategic for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and DOWN merge the 256s, but UP positions the 512 in the top-middle and keeps the 256 in the bottom-right corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners. UP is more favorable for future moves.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

Columns 1 and 2 (with zeros in row 3) shift tiles downward:  \n     - Column 1: `[16, 4, 2, 0]` → `[0, 16, 4, 2]` (row 1 now has 16 in column 1).  \n     - Column 2: `[512, 2, 32, 0]` → `[0, 512, 2, 32]` (row 1 now has 512 in column 2).  \n   - Resulting grid after DOWN:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 2 | 0 | 0 | 16  \n     Row 1: 16 | 16 | 512 | 64  \n     Row 2: 64 | 4 | 2 | 8  \n     Row 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 256  \n     ```  \n   - **Key Opportunity**: Row 1 now has adjacent 16s (columns 0 and 1). This sets up a future LEFT swipe to merge them into 32, creating a scoring opportunity.  \n   - 256 remains in the bottom-right corner, preserving a large tile in a corner (a strategic best practice).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move, as it creates adjacent 16s in row 1 (enabling a future merge) and keeps the 256 tile in the bottom-right corner.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 2 | 32 | 0 | 16  \nRow 1: 16 | 16 | 512 | 64  \nRow 2: 64 | 4 | 2 | 8  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 256  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [2, 32, 0, 16] → Tiles shift left, no merges → [2, 32, 16, 0].  \n- **Row 1**: [16, 16, 512, 64] → Two 16s merge into 32 (score +32) → [32, 512, 64, 0].  \n- **Row 2**: [64, 4, 2, 8] → No merges, no shifts → [64, 4, 2, 8].  \n- **Row 3**: [32, 2, 32, 256] → No merges, no shifts → [32, 2, 32, 256].  \n- **Score**: 32. Empty spaces: Row 0 (col 3), Row 1 (col 3).  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [2, 32, 0, 16] → Tiles shift right, no merges → [0, 2, 32, 16].  \n- **Row 1**: [16, 16, 512, 64] → Two 16s merge into 32 (score +32) → [0, 32, 512, 64].  \n- **Row 2**: [64, 4, 2, 8] → No merges, no shifts → [64, 4, 2, 8].  \n- **Row 3**: [32, 2, 32, 256] → No merges, no shifts → [32, 2, 32, 256].  \n- **Score**: 32. Empty spaces: Row 0 (col 0), Row 1 (col 0).  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- All columns have no adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to enable merging. No merges occur.  \n- **Score**: 0.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- All columns have no adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to enable merging. No merges occur.  \n- **Score**: 0.  \n\n\n### Strategy Consideration:  \nThe only valid merges occur in Row 1 (two 16s merging into 32) for both LEFT and RIGHT. To maintain larger tiles (512, 256) in the right side (a common 2048 strategy), RIGHT is preferable. Swiping RIGHT keeps the 512 and 64 in the right half of Row 1, aligning with the 256 in the bottom-right corner. New tiles (2\/4) will spawn in the left empty spaces (Row 0, col 0; Row 1, col 0), minimizing disruption to larger tiles.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: [0, 2, 32, 16]  \nRow 1: [32, 32, 512, 64]  \nRow 2: [64, 4, 2, 8]  \nRow 3: [32, 2, 32, 256]  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left → [2, 32, 16, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: The two 32s merge into 64 → [64, 512, 64, 0] (score +64).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left → [64, 4, 2, 8] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left → [32, 2, 32, 256] (no merges).  \n- Empty space appears in Row 0, Column 3 (a corner), which is strategic for future tile placement.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right → [0, 2, 32, 16] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: The two 32s merge into 64 → [0, 64, 512, 64] (score +64).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right → [64, 4, 2, 8] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right → [32, 2, 32, 256] (no merges).  \n- Empty space appears in Row 1, Column 0 (not a corner), which is less ideal for future tile placement.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- All columns are processed upward. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in any column are equal.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- All columns are processed downward. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in any column are equal.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield a merge (64 points), but LEFT places the empty space in a corner (Row 0, Column 3), which is better for future strategic tile placement. UP and DOWN do not produce merges and are suboptimal.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score through merges while strategically positioning larger tiles (e.g., 256 in the bottom-right corner).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 2 | 32 | 16 | 0  \nRow 1: 64 | 512 | 64 | 8  \nRow 2: 64 | 4 | 2 | 8  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 256  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### LEFT\/RIGHT:\n- **LEFT**: No merges occur in any row.

The grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same number.

No adjacent tiles in any row are identical, so no merges occur. The grid remains unchanged.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Each row is shifted right. No adjacent tiles in any row are identical, so no merges occur. The grid remains unchanged.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Each column is shifted up. No adjacent tiles in any column are identical, so no merges occur. The grid remains unchanged.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Each column is shifted down. No adjacent tiles in any column are identical, so no merges occur. The grid remains unchanged.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied, and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number. This means there are no valid moves to merge tiles or create empty spaces. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and all moves are technically possible (even if they do not change the grid), any direction could be chosen. For consistency, we select the first direction in the list.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify a move that allows merging tiles (to gain score) or creates opportunities for future merges, while avoiding filling the grid without valid moves.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|16|4|512  \nRow 1: 2|512|64|16  \nRow 2: 128|4|2|256  \nRow 3: 32|2|32|8  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Each row is processed leftward. All rows are full (no empty tiles), and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. For example, Row 3: `32|2|32|8` has non-adjacent 32s (separated by 2), so no merges occur. No valid merges or tile shifts.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Each row is processed rightward. Similar to the left swipe, all rows are full, and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. For example, Row 3: `32|2|32|8` has non-adjacent 32s, so no merges occur. No valid merges or tile shifts.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Each column is processed upward. All columns are full, and no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. For example, Column 0: `32|2|128|32` has non-adjacent 32s (separated by 2 and 128), so no merges occur. No valid merges or tile shifts.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Each column is processed downward. All columns are full, and no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. However, strategically, shifting tiles downward may help position larger tiles (e.g., 512, 256) toward the bottom row, potentially creating future merge opportunities. For example, Column 3: `512|16|256|8` could shift 512 closer to the bottom, though no immediate merges occur.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves are invalid in the strict sense (no adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to shift into). However, among the options, **DOWN** is chosen as a strategic move to potentially position larger tiles for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid, which has no empty tiles (0s) and all tiles are distinct powers of 2. A valid move requires either adjacent tiles of the same number (to merge) or empty spaces to shift tiles into. Since the grid is full, only moves with adjacent equal tiles are valid.  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: All rows are filled with distinct numbers. For example, row 4 is `32|2|32|8`—the 32s are separated by a 2 and cannot merge. No merges occur in any row.  \n- **RIGHT**: Similarly, all rows have distinct numbers. For example, row 4 remains `32|2|32|8` when shifted right, with no adjacent equal tiles to merge.  \n- **UP**: All columns are filled with distinct numbers. For example, column 0 is `32|2|128|32`—the 32s are separated by 2 and 128 and cannot merge. No merges occur in any column.  \n- **DOWN**: All columns have distinct numbers. For example, column 0 remains `32|2|128|32` when shifted down, with no adjacent equal tiles to merge.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nNo direction results in a valid merge, as there are no adjacent equal tiles. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the directions, we choose based on strategic positioning (e.g., aligning larger tiles for future merges). Among the options, **LEFT** is chosen as a neutral default.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules.

For example, Row 3: `32 | 2 | 32 | 8` has 32s separated by a 2, so no merges. Tiles cannot shift left because the row is full (no empty spaces). The board remains unchanged.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Similarly, all rows have distinct numbers with no adjacent duplicates. For example, Row 3: `32 | 2 | 32 | 8` has 32s separated by a 2, so no merges. Tiles cannot shift right because the row is full (no empty spaces). The board remains unchanged.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - All columns have distinct numbers with no adjacent duplicates. For example, Column 0: `32 | 2 | 128 | 32` has 32s separated by 2 and 128, so no merges. Tiles cannot shift up because the column is full (no empty spaces). The board remains unchanged.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - All columns have distinct numbers with no adjacent duplicates. For example, Column 0: `32 | 2 | 128 | 32` has 32s separated by 2 and 128, so no merges. Tiles cannot shift down because the column is full (no empty spaces). The board remains unchanged.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is completely full (no empty tiles), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number in any row or column. By the game rules, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the choice defaults to the first option (LEFT) as a placeholder.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and the game rules.

However, the game requires a move, and strategic considerations (e.g., aligning larger tiles for future merges) favor **LEFT**. This direction keeps the largest tile (`512` in Row 0, Column 3) in a corner, a common strategy to avoid blocking future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and valid moves. The grid is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 4 | 512  \nRow 1: 2 | 512 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 4 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 8  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **Adjacent tile check**: No horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles have the same value. For example:\n  - Row 3 has \"32 | 2 | 32 | 8\" (32s are separated by a 2, not adjacent).\n  - Column 0 has \"32 | 2 | 128 | 32\" (32s are separated by 2 and 128, not adjacent).\n  - All other rows and columns also lack adjacent equal tiles.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Swiping left or right would not merge any tiles, as no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. The rows remain unchanged.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Swiping up or down would not merge any tiles, as no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. The columns remain unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given no strategic advantage, any direction is equally invalid, but we arbitrarily choose one.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning. The game board is:\n\n```\n32|16|4|512\n2|512|64|16\n128|4|2|256\n32|2|32|8\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **No Empty Tiles**: All 16 tiles are non-zero, so the grid is full.\n2. **Adjacent Tiles**: No two adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. For example:\n   - Row 0: 32, 16, 4, 512 (all distinct).\n   - Row 1: 2, 512, 64, 16 (all distinct).\n   - Row 2: 128, 4, 2, 256 (all distinct).\n   - Row 3: 32, 2, 32, 8 (32s are separated by a 2, not adjacent).\n   - Columns: All columns also have distinct values (e.g., column 0: 32, 2, 128, 32; 32s are separated by 2 and 128).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Tiles in each row are already fully packed (no empty spaces), and no adjacent tiles can merge. Swiping left\/right will not change the board.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Tiles in each column are fully packed (no empty spaces), and no adjacent tiles can merge. Swiping up\/down will not change the board.\n\n### Validity of Moves:\nA valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since the grid is full (no empty spaces) and no adjacent tiles can merge, **no moves are valid**. However, the problem expects a direction, so the choice defaults to strategic positioning (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners). The 512 in (0,3) is in the top-right corner, and the 256 in (2,3) is near the bottom-right corner. Swiping **DOWN** might help keep larger tiles in the lower half for future merges, though no immediate merges occur.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the validity of swiping left, right, up, or down. A valid move requires either adjacent equal tiles (which can merge) or empty spaces (to shift tiles into). The current grid has no empty tiles (all 16 tiles are filled), so validity depends on the presence of adjacent equal tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 4 | 512\nRow 1: 2 | 512 | 64 | 16\nRow 2: 128 | 4 | 2 | 256\nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   All rows are fully occupied with no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 3 (`32 | 2 | 32 | 8`) has 32s separated by a 2, so no merges occur. No tiles shift left because there are no empty spaces.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Similarly, all rows are full, and no adjacent equal tiles exist. For Row 3, the 32s remain separated by a 2 even when shifting right, so no merges or shifts occur.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   All columns are fully occupied. Column 0 (`32 | 2 | 128 | 32`) has 32s in Row 0 and Row 3, but they are not adjacent (separated by 2 and 128). No other columns have adjacent equal tiles. No tiles shift up.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   All columns are full, and no adjacent equal tiles exist. Column 0’s 32s (Row 0 and Row 3) are not adjacent, and no other columns have merges. No tiles shift down.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is completely full, and there are no adjacent equal tiles in any row or column. By the rules, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any direction is technically invalid, but a default choice is necessary.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges and valid shifts in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is currently full (no empty tiles), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number to merge.

By the rules, this means there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any direction is technically a placeholder (as no move will alter the grid).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) by checking if tiles can shift or merge. The game board has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number to merge or tiles to shift into empty spaces (which do not exist here).  \n\n### LEFT Move:  \nAll rows are full with distinct numbers. For example, row 3: `[32, 2, 32, 8]` has two 32s but they are separated by a 2, so no merging. No tiles shift left because there are no empty spaces. **No movement or merging.**  \n\n### RIGHT Move:  \nSimilarly, all rows are full with distinct numbers. For example, row 0: `[32, 16, 4, 512]` has no adjacent duplicates, and no empty spaces to shift into. **No movement or merging.**  \n\n### UP Move:  \nAll columns are full with distinct numbers. Column 0: `[32, 2, 128, 32]` has two 32s but they are not adjacent (separated by 2 and 128). No tiles shift up due to no empty spaces. **No movement or merging.**  \n\n### DOWN Move:  \nAll columns are full with distinct numbers. Column 3: `[512, 16, 256, 8]` has no adjacent duplicates, and no empty spaces to shift into. **No movement or merging.**  \n\nSince all directions result in no valid shifts or merges, there are no valid moves.

For example:\n   - Row 3 has 32s at (3,0) and (3,2), but they are separated by a 2 and not adjacent.\n   - Column 0 has 32s at (0,0) and (3,0), but they are separated by 2 and 128, so no vertical adjacency.\n   - All other rows and columns also lack adjacent duplicates.\n\n2. **Valid Moves**: A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, **no direction will result in a merge or meaningful tile movement**. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile no direction leads to a merge or strategic improvement, the choice is arbitrary. Given the lack of better options, we select **LEFT** as a default.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for possible merges in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

The two 32s (now in row 2 and row 3) are adjacent and merge into 64.

For example:\n  - Row 0: 32, 16, 4, 512 (all distinct).\n  - Row 1: 2, 512, 64, 16 (all distinct).\n  - Row 2: 128, 4, 2, 256 (all distinct).\n  - Row 3: 32, 2, 32, 8 (32s are separated by 2, not adjacent).\n  - Columns: All columns also have distinct values (e.g., Column 0: 32, 2, 128, 32; 32s are separated by 2 and 128).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are equal, shifting in any direction will not result in merges. Tiles cannot move into empty spaces (none exist), so all moves leave the grid unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNo valid moves result in merges or tile movement. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given no strategic advantage, any direction is technically acceptable, but we choose LEFT as a default.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile movement.

However, per the problem’s requirement to select one of the four directions, any direction is technically invalid, but we default to **LEFT** as a placeholder.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or shifting tiles into empty spaces. The current board has no empty tiles (no 0s), so we check for adjacent tiles that can merge in any direction.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 32|16|4|512  \nRow 1: 2|512|64|16  \nRow 2: 128|4|2|256  \nRow 3: 32|2|32|8  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows are full (no empty spaces), and no adjacent tiles in any row are the same. Shifting left would not merge any tiles or create empty spaces.  \n   - Example: Row 3 (32|2|32|8) has non-adjacent 32s, so no merge occurs.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Similarly, all rows are full, and no adjacent tiles in any row are the same.

Thus, **no valid moves** exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and all directions are invalid, the game would end, but the answer must still be chosen from the options.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile movement. The game board is:\n\n```\n32|16|4|512\n2|512|64|16\n128|4|2|256\n32|2|32|8\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid is Full**: All 16 tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces, i.e., no `0` values).\n2. **Adjacent Tiles**: No adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value, so no merges are possible in any direction.\n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipe**: Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are equal, tiles cannot merge. Swiping left or right would not shift any tiles (as there are no empty spaces to fill), resulting in no change to the board.\n- **UP\/DOWN Swipe**: Similarly, with no empty spaces and no adjacent equal tiles vertically, swiping up or down would not cause any merges or tile movement.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and there are no adjacent equal tiles. By the rules, a valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles or moving tiles into empty spaces. Since neither condition is met, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, so a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile alignment, and strategic positioning (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 4 | 512  \nRow 1: 2 | 512 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 4 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 8  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **No Immediate Merges**: All adjacent tiles (horizontally and vertically) are distinct, so no merges occur in any direction.  \n2. **Grid is Full**: There are no empty tiles (0s), so tiles cannot shift into empty spaces.  \n3. **Large Tiles**: The largest tiles are two 512s (at (0,3) and (1,1)) and a 256 (at (2,3)). Strategic play suggests keeping large tiles in corners for future merges. The 512 at (0,3) is already in the top-right corner, a strong position.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT**: Tiles in each row shift left, but no merges occur. The 512 at (0,3) remains in the corner.  \n- **RIGHT**: Tiles in each row shift right, but no merges occur. The 512 at (0,3) stays in the corner.  \n- **UP**: Tiles in each column shift up, but no merges occur. The 512 at (0,3) remains in the corner.  \n- **DOWN**: Tiles in each column shift down, but no merges occur. The 512 at (0,3) stays in the corner.  \n\n### Strategic Choice:\nSince no merges are possible and the grid is full, the choice prioritizes maintaining the position of large tiles. The 512 at (0,3) (top-right corner) is already optimally placed. Among the options, **DOWN** is chosen to avoid disrupting this corner and to potentially set up future moves if space is created (though not immediately possible here).\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board has no empty tiles (0s), meaning all tiles are occupied. A valid move requires either adjacent equal tiles (to merge) or empty spaces (to shift tiles into). Since there are no empty spaces, we check for adjacent equal tiles:\n\n- **Horizontal Adjacents**: All rows have distinct numbers (e.g., Row 0: 32, 16, 4, 512; Row 3: 32, 2, 32, 8 – 32s are not adjacent).\n- **Vertical Adjacents**: All columns also have distinct numbers (e.g., Column 0: 32, 2, 128, 32 – 32s are not adjacent).\n\nThus, no merges are possible in any direction. However, the game requires selecting a move (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) as per the problem constraints.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\nSince no merges or shifts are possible (all tiles are full and no adjacent equals), any move will not change the board state. However, strategic placement of larger tiles (e.g., 512 in top-right corner) is a key heuristic. Moving LEFT keeps larger tiles (e.g., 512 in Row 0, Column 3) in place, maintaining a corner position, which is generally favorable for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile alignment.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 4 | 512  \nRow 1: 2 | 512 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 4 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 8  \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no zeros), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent equal tiles.  \n- **No adjacent equal tiles**: Checking all rows and columns, there are no horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles with the same value. For example:  \n  - Row 3 has 32s at (3,0) and (3,2), but they are separated by a 2 (not adjacent).  \n  - No other tiles in rows or columns are adjacent and equal.  \n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: Since there are no empty tiles to shift into and no adjacent equal tiles to merge, none of the directions will result in tile merges or shifts. However, the game requires choosing a direction (as per the problem constraints).  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe goal is to position larger tiles in a corner for future merges. The largest tiles (512, 256, 128) are spread across the grid. Among the options, **DOWN** is chosen to align smaller tiles downward, potentially creating future merging opportunities in subsequent moves.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile positioning.

Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend solely on merging adjacent tiles.\n2. **Adjacent Tiles Check**:  \n   - **Rows**: No adjacent tiles in any row are equal (e.g., Row 0: 32, 16, 4, 512; Row 3: 32, 2, 32, 8—32s are separated by 2 and not adjacent).  \n   - **Columns**: No adjacent tiles in any column are equal (e.g., Column 0: 32, 2, 128, 32—32s are separated by 2 and 128; Column 3: 512, 16, 256, 8—all distinct).  \n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Swiping left or right would not merge any tiles, as no adjacent tiles in rows are equal, and all rows are already fully occupied (no empty spaces to shift into).  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: Swiping up or down would not merge any tiles, as no adjacent tiles in columns are equal, and all columns are fully occupied (no empty spaces to shift into).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are invalid under the rules, as no merges are possible and no empty spaces exist to shift tiles into. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, a strategic choice is made to prioritize future merging potential. Swiping **DOWN** is chosen as a default, assuming it may create opportunities for future merges if new tiles spawn.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules.

No merges or shifts occur.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   Similarly, all rows are checked for adjacent equal tiles when shifted right. No adjacent equal tiles exist (e.g., Row 3: 32, 2, 32, 8—32s remain non-adjacent after shifting). No merges or shifts occur.  \n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   Columns are checked for adjacent equal tiles. Columns 0–3 have no adjacent equal tiles (e.g., Column 0: 32, 2, 128, 32—32s are separated by 2 and 128). No merges or shifts occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   Columns are checked for adjacent equal tiles when shifted down. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column (e.g., Column 0: 32, 2, 128, 32—32s remain non-adjacent after shifting).

For example:\n   - Row 3 has 32, 2, 32, 8, but the 32s are separated by a 2 and not adjacent.\n   - Other rows and columns also have distinct adjacent values (e.g., 32, 16, 4, 512 in Row 0; 2, 512, 64, 16 in Row 1; etc.).\n3. **Valid Moves**: A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or moving tiles into empty spaces. Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are the same, **no valid moves exist** to merge or shift tiles.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: All directions would not result in merging tiles (no adjacent duplicates) and cannot shift tiles (grid is full). Thus, no direction leads to a valid move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent tiles to merge, meaning there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given no valid moves exist, any direction is technically invalid, but the answer must be chosen from the options.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning. The grid is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 4 | 512\nRow 1: 2 | 512 | 64 | 16\nRow 2: 128 | 4 | 2 | 256\nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 8\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid Fullness**: All tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value to merge.\n2. **Adjacent Tiles Check**: No horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles have the same value. For example:\n   - Row 3 has 32s at (3,0) and (3,2), but they are separated by a 2 and not adjacent.\n   - The 512s at (0,3) and (1,1) are not adjacent.\n   - No other pairs of equal tiles are adjacent.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Swiping left or right does not merge any tiles because no adjacent equal tiles exist, and the grid is full (no empty spaces to shift into).\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Swiping up or down also does not merge any tiles, as no vertical adjacent equal tiles exist, and the grid is full (no empty spaces to shift into).\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nSince no merges are possible with the current configuration, the game would end if no valid moves remain. However, the epoch is 88 (less than 100), implying the game continues. To maximize future potential, directing larger tiles (e.g., 512, 256) toward a corner (e.g., bottom-right) is strategic. Swiping DOWN aligns with this goal, as it shifts tiles toward the bottom, potentially setting up future merges if new tiles (2\/4) spawn in favorable positions.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and game rules. The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same number. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 4 | 512  \nRow 1: 2 | 512 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 4 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 8  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Each row is processed left to right. No adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., Row 0: 32, 16, 4, 512; Row 3: 32, 2, 32, 8). No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift left (grid is full). **No valid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Each row is processed right to left. No adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., Row 0: 32, 16, 4, 512; Row 3: 32, 2, 32, 8). No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift right (grid is full). **No valid move**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Each column is processed top to bottom. No adjacent tiles in any column are the same (e.g., Column 0: 32, 2, 128, 32; Column 3: 512, 16, 256, 8). No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift up (grid is full). **No valid move**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Each column is processed bottom to top. No adjacent tiles in any column are the same (e.g., Column 0: 32, 2, 128, 32; Column 3: 512, 16, 256, 8). No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift down (grid is full). **No valid move**.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied, and there are no adjacent tiles of the same number in any direction. Thus, **no valid moves** exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the directions, we arbitrarily choose based on the need to provide an answer.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic positioning of larger tiles. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 32|16|4|512  \nRow 1: 2|512|64|16  \nRow 2: 128|4|2|256  \nRow 3: 32|2|32|8  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid Status**: All tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n2. **Merging Opportunities**: No adjacent tiles in rows or columns are identical. For example:\n   - Row 3 has two 32s (positions 0 and 2) but they are separated by a 2, so they cannot merge directly.\n   - Other rows and columns also lack adjacent identical tiles (e.g., 512s in Row 0, Column 3 and Row 1, Column 1 are diagonal, not adjacent).\n3. **Strategic Consideration**: Since no merges are possible, the choice of move focuses on minimizing disruption to larger tiles (e.g., 512, 256) and preparing for future merges. Larger tiles are spread across the grid, but moving down may help align smaller tiles for potential future merges.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: No merges occur, as tiles in all rows are distinct and cannot collapse into adjacent positions.\n- **UP**: Columns have no adjacent identical tiles, so no merges occur.\n- **DOWN**: Columns also have no adjacent identical tiles, but moving down shifts tiles toward the bottom edge, which could create space for future merges if new tiles (2 or 4) are added. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners (e.g., 512 in Row 0, Column 3 remains stable).\n\nGiven the lack of immediate merges, DOWN is chosen as it maintains the structure of larger tiles and positions smaller tiles for potential future combinations.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or tile movements in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value to merge. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Grid State:\n```\nRow 0: 32|16|4|512  \nRow 1: 2|512|64|16  \nRow 2: 128|4|2|256  \nRow 3: 32|2|32|8  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows have distinct adjacent tiles. For example, Row 3: `32|2|32|8` has 32s separated by a 2, so no merge. No tiles shift left because the row is full. No merges or movement.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Similarly, all rows have distinct adjacent tiles. Row 3: `32|2|32|8` has 32s separated by a 2, so no merge. No tiles shift right because the row is full. No merges or movement.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - All columns have distinct adjacent tiles. For example, Column 0: `32|2|128|32` has 32s separated by 2 and 128, so no merge. No tiles shift up because the column is full. No merges or movement.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - All columns have distinct adjacent tiles. Column 0: `32|2|128|32` has 32s separated by 2 and 128, so no merge. No tiles shift down because the column is full. No merges or movement.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied, and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. This means there are no valid moves to merge tiles or shift them into empty spaces. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any direction is technically a forced choice. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible merges or tile movements for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 4 | 512  \nRow 1: 2 | 512 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 4 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 8  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid Fullness**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no zeros), so no empty spaces exist. Valid moves require either merging adjacent tiles of the same value or moving tiles into empty spaces. Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend solely on merging adjacent tiles.\n2. **Adjacent Tiles Check**: No two adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. For example:\n   - Row 0: 32, 16, 4, 512 (all distinct).\n   - Row 1: 2, 512, 64, 16 (all distinct).\n   - Row 2: 128, 4, 2, 256 (all distinct).\n   - Row 3: 32, 2, 32, 8 (32s are separated by a 2, not adjacent).\n   - Columns: All columns also contain distinct values (e.g., Column 0: 32, 2, 128, 32; 32s are non-adjacent).\n\n### Evaluation of Directions:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Tiles shift horizontally, but no adjacent merges are possible (all tiles in rows are distinct or non-adjacent).\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Tiles shift vertically, but no adjacent merges are possible (all tiles in columns are distinct or non-adjacent).\n\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, no valid moves exist. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, any direction is technically invalid, but we choose **LEFT** as a default.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for potential merges and valid shifts in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

Thus, no valid merges are possible in any direction. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, an arbitrary choice is made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic positioning of tiles. The game board is fully occupied (no empty tiles, 0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same value to merge. If no such adjacents exist, the game ends.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 4 | 512  \nRow 1: 2 | 512 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 4 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 8  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   - All rows are fully occupied (no empty spaces). For merging, tiles must be adjacent after shifting. In Row 3: [32, 2, 32, 8], the two 32s are separated by a 2. Since there are no empty spaces, tiles cannot shift left, so the 32s remain non-adjacent. No merges occur in any row.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - Similarly, all rows are fully occupied. In Row 3: [32, 2, 32, 8], the 32s are separated by a 2. No empty spaces prevent shifting, so the 32s remain non-adjacent. No merges occur in any row.  \n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   - All columns are fully occupied.

Vertical adjacents (same as UP) have no duplicates. No merges occur.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe grid is full, and there are no adjacent tiles with the same value in any direction. By the game rules, no valid moves remain, and the game ends. However, since the task requires selecting one of the four directions, the answer defaults to the first option (LEFT) as a placeholder, though no valid move exists.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and game rules. A valid move requires either empty spaces to shift tiles or adjacent tiles that can merge. The grid has no empty tiles (0s), so validity depends on merge potential.\n\n### Grid State:\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 4 | 512  \nRow 1: 2 | 512 | 64 | 16  \nRow 2: 128 | 4 | 2 | 256  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 8  \n\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: 32, 16, 4, 512 (no adjacent equals; no merge).  \n   - **Row 1**: 2, 512, 64, 16 (no adjacent equals; no merge).  \n   - **Row 2**: 128, 4, 2, 256 (no adjacent equals; no merge).  \n   - **Row 3**: 32, 2, 32, 8. When moving left, the 32 in position 0 and 32 in position 2 shift left, merging into 64 (since they become adjacent after shifting). This creates a valid merge.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - All rows have no adjacent equal tiles when shifted right. For example, Row 3 (32, 2, 32, 8) cannot merge when shifted right because the 32s are not adjacent after shifting.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - All columns (vertical) have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Column 0 (32, 2, 128, 32) has no adjacent equals when shifted up.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - All columns (vertical) have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Column 0 (32, 2, 128, 32) has no adjacent equals when shifted down.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only valid move is **LEFT**, as Row 3 contains two 32s that merge into 64 when shifted left.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or shifts in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

The grid is fully occupied (no 0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number.  \n\n### Analysis of Directions:  \n- **LEFT**: Check each row for adjacent equal tiles. All rows have distinct adjacent values (e.g., Row 0: 32,16,4,512; Row 3: 32,2,32,8—32s are not adjacent). No merges or shifts possible.  \n- **RIGHT**: Similarly, all rows have distinct adjacent values (e.g., Row 1: 2,512,64,16; Row 3: 32,2,32,8). No merges or shifts possible.  \n- **UP**: Check each column for adjacent equal tiles. All columns have distinct adjacent values (e.g., Column 0: 32,2,128,32; Column 3: 512,16,256,8). No merges or shifts possible.  \n- **DOWN**: Check each column for adjacent equal tiles. All columns have distinct adjacent values (e.g., Column 0: 32,2,128,32; Column 2: 4,64,2,32). No merges or shifts possible.  \n\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are equal, no valid moves exist. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n32|16|4|512\n2|512|64|16\n128|4|2|256\n32|2|32|8\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The goal is to position tiles to enable merging in subsequent moves, following the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current grid has two 2s at positions (row 2, column 1) and (row 3, column 2). All other tiles are empty (0). The objective is to shift these 2s such that they can merge in future moves.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   - Row 2 (0,2,0,0) shifts left to (2,0,0,0).  \n   - Row 3 (0,0,2,0) shifts left to (2,0,0,0).  \n   - Result: 2s are in (row 2, column 0) and (row 3, column 0) (same column, vertically adjacent). A subsequent UP move could merge them, but no immediate merge occurs.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - Row 2 (0,2,0,0) shifts right to (0,0,0,2).  \n   - Row 3 (0,0,2,0) shifts right to (0,0,0,2).  \n   - Result: 2s are in (row 2, column 3) and (row 3, column 3) (same column, vertically adjacent). A subsequent DOWN move could merge them, but no immediate merge occurs.  \n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   - Column 1 (0,0,2,0) shifts up to (2,0,0,0).  \n   - Column 2 (0,0,0,2) shifts up to (2,0,0,0).  \n   - Result: 2s are in (row 0, column 1) and (row 0, column 2) (same row, horizontally adjacent). A subsequent LEFT move would merge them into a 4, placing it in the top-left corner (a strategic corner).  \n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   - Column 1 (0,0,2,0) shifts down to (0,0,0,2).  \n   - Column 2 (0,0,0,2) remains in (0,0,0,2).  \n   - Result: 2s are in (row 3, column 1) and (row 3, column 2) (same row, horizontally adjacent). A subsequent LEFT move would merge them into a 4, placing it in the bottom-left corner.  \n\n### Strategic Choice:\nAll moves set up potential merges, but **UP** is preferred because it positions the 2s in the top row (row 0), adjacent horizontally. A subsequent LEFT move will merge them into a 4 in the top-left corner, aligning with the strategy of concentrating larger tiles in corners. This setup maximizes future merging potential and follows optimal 2048 strategy.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the game board and strategy of consolidating larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|2|2|0\nRow 1: 0|0|2|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift left. The two adjacent 2s (columns 1 and 2) merge into 4. Result: `4|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles shift left. The 2 (column 2) moves to column 0. Result: `2|0|0|0`.  \n   - Rows 2 and 3: Remain all zeros.  \n   - Merged 4 is placed in the top-left corner (row 0, column 0), a strategic corner for future merges. The 2 in row 1, column 0 is positioned below the 4, allowing potential vertical merges in subsequent moves.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift right. The two adjacent 2s (columns 1 and 2) merge into 4. Result: `0|0|0|4`.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles shift right. The 2 (column 2) moves to column 3. Result: `0|0|0|2`.  \n   - Rows 2 and 3: Remain all zeros.  \n   - Merged 4 is placed in the top-right corner (row 0, column 3), but the 2 in row 1, column 3 is less central to the initial tile distribution (original 2s are on the left side of the board).  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 2: Tiles shift up. The two 2s (row 0 and row 1) merge into 4. Result: Row 0, column 2 becomes 4.  \n   - Column 1: The 2 (row 0) shifts up to row 0, column 1.  \n   - Resulting grid: `0|2|4|0` (row 0), with rows 1-3 empty.  \n   - Merged 4 is placed in row 0, column 2 (not a corner), reducing strategic value for future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 2: Tiles shift down. The two 2s (row 0 and row 1) merge into 4. Result: Row 3, column 2 becomes 4.  \n   - Column 1: The 2 (row 0) shifts down to row 3, column 1.  \n   - Resulting grid: Row 3 becomes `0|2|4|0`, with rows 0-2 empty.  \n   - Merged 4 is placed in row 3, column 2 (not a corner), limiting strategic consolidation.  \n\n\n### Optimal Move:\nThe LEFT swipe consolidates the merged 4 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and positions the 2 in row 1, column 0 (below the 4), facilitating future vertical merges. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners and building upward\/leftward.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles and positioning larger tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 1: [4, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [2, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [2, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nKey observation: The first column (column 1) has a 4 in row 1, followed by two 2s in rows 2 and 3. This column is critical for merging.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   - Moving LEFT or RIGHT shifts tiles horizontally. However, all non-zero tiles are in the first column, and the rest of the columns are empty. Shifting left\/right would only move these tiles to the leftmost or rightmost positions of their rows but would not trigger any merges (no adjacent equal tiles). No score gain.\n\n2. **DOWN**:  \n   - Moving DOWN shifts tiles in column 1 downward. The non-zero tiles (4, 2, 2) would stack from the bottom. The two 2s in rows 2 and 3 of column 1 would merge into a 4 (score +4). However, the merged 4 would be placed in row 3, and the original 4 would shift to row 2. This positions larger tiles (4s) in the middle of the column, not a corner.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Moving UP shifts tiles in column 1 upward. The non-zero tiles (4, 2, 2) would stack from the top. The two 2s in rows 2 and 3 of column 1 would merge into a 4 (score +4). The merged 4 would be placed in row 2, while the original 4 remains in row 1. This positions the 4s in the top two rows of column 1, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (top-left corner).\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nMoving UP merges the two 2s into a 4, gains score, and positions the 4s in the top-left corner, which is optimal for future merges (e.g., merging the two 4s in column 1 in subsequent moves).\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes on the given game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 4|0|2|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [4,0,0,0] → shifts left to [4,0,0,0] (no merging).  \n   - Row 1: [4,0,2,0] → shifts left to [4,2,0,0] (no merging, as 4 and 2 are different).  \n   - Rows 2-3: Remain all zeros.  \n   - **Result**: No merging occurs; no score is gained. The 4s in column 0 (rows 0 and 1) remain unmerged.  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [4,0,0,0] → shifts right to [0,0,0,4].  \n   - Row 1: [4,0,2,0] → shifts right to [0,0,4,2] (no merging).  \n   - Rows 2-3: Remain all zeros.  \n   - **Result**: No merging occurs; no score is gained. The 4s are scattered in different columns.  \n\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: [4 (row0), 4 (row1), 0, 0] → shifts up, merging the two 4s into 8 (score +8). The merged 8 occupies row0, column0.  \n   - Column 2: [0 (row0), 2 (row1), 0, 0] → shifts up, moving the 2 to row0, column2.  \n   - Columns 1 and 3: Remain all zeros.  \n   - **Result**: Merges the two 4s into 8 (score +8). The 8 is placed in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and the 2 moves to row0, column2.  \n\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: [4 (row0), 4 (row1), 0, 0] → shifts down, merging the two 4s into 8 (score +8). The merged 8 occupies row3, column0.  \n   - Column 2: [0 (row0), 2 (row1), 0, 0] → shifts down, moving the 2 to row3, column2.  \n   - Columns 1 and 3: Remain all zeros.  \n   - **Result**: Merges the two 4s into 8 (score +8). The 8 is placed in the bottom-left corner, and the 2 moves to row3, column2.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:  \nBoth UP and DOWN merge the 4s to gain 8 points. However, keeping larger tiles in a corner is critical for future merges. The top-left corner (row0, column0) is a common strategic corner in 2048, as it allows for better organization of smaller tiles around it. UP places the merged 8 in this corner, making it more favorable for future moves.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (e.g., keeping larger tiles in corners and enabling future merges).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|2|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|4\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\nThe largest tile is 8, and the other tiles are 2 and 4. The goal is to position tiles to enable future merges and keep larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Each row shifts tiles to the left.  \n   - Row 0: [8, 0, 2, 0] → [8, 2, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: All zeros → remains [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n   - Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 4] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: All zeros → remains [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n   - Resulting board after LEFT:  \n     ```\n     8|2|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     4|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - The 8 (largest tile) is in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and smaller tiles (2, 4) are positioned to potentially merge with future tiles.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row shifts tiles to the right.  \n   - Row 0: [8, 0, 2, 0] → [0, 0, 8, 2] (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: All zeros → remains [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n   - Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 4] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no change).  \n   - Row 3: All zeros → remains [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n   - Resulting board after RIGHT:  \n     ```\n     0|0|8|2  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|4  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - The 8 is not in a corner, reducing strategic positioning for future merges.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Each column shifts tiles upward.  \n   - Column 0: [8, 0, 0, 0] → [8, 0, 0, 0] (no change).  \n   - Column 1: All zeros → remains [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n   - Column 2: [2, 0, 0, 0] → [2, 0, 0, 0] (no change).  \n   - Column 3: [0, 0, 4, 0] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (no change).  \n   - Resulting board after UP:  \n     ```\n     8|0|2|4  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - The 8 is in the top-left corner, but the 2 and 4 are spread across the top row, limiting merge potential.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Each column shifts tiles downward.  \n   - Column 0: [8, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 8] (8 moves to bottom-left).  \n   - Column 1: All zeros → remains [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n   - Column 2: [2, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 2] (2 moves to bottom row).  \n   - Column 3: [0, 0, 4, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (4 moves to bottom row).  \n   - Resulting board after DOWN:  \n     ```\n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     8|0|2|4  \n     ```  \n   - The 8 is in the bottom-left corner, but the 2 and 4 are spread across the bottom row, reducing merge opportunities.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT positions the largest tile (8) in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and aligns smaller tiles (2, 4) in a way that increases the potential for future merges. This is the most optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (e.g., merging potential, tile positioning).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|2|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|4\nRow 2: 4|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: `8|2|0|0` → shifts left (no merge, remains `8|2|0|0`).  \n   - Row 1: `0|0|0|4` → shifts left to `4|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 2: `4|0|0|0` → shifts left (no change, remains `4|0|0|0`).  \n   - Row 3: `0|0|0|0` → no change.  \n   Resulting board after LEFT:  \n   ```\n   8|2|0|0  \n   4|0|0|0  \n   4|0|0|0  \n   0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   No immediate merges, but the two `4`s in Row 1 and Row 2 (Column 0) set up a future merge (e.g., a subsequent UP move would merge them into an `8`).

The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32), and the 4 shifts left. Result: `32|4|0|0`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left. The 8 and 2 shift left into empty spaces. Result: `8|2|0|0`.  \n- **Rows 3-4**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 16s for 32 points, consolidates larger tiles (32, 8) in the top-left corner, ideal for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right. The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32), but the 4 shifts right. Result: `0|0|32|4`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right. The 8 and 2 shift right into empty spaces.

No tiles in the same column are equal (16 vs. 8 in Column 1; 16 vs. 0 in Column 2; 4 vs. 2 in Column 3), so no merging occurs. Tiles cannot shift upward (e.g., 8 in Row 2, Column 1 cannot move up as Row 1, Column 1 is occupied).  \n- **Outcome**: No movement or merging. Invalid move.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed vertically. Tiles shift down, but no equal tiles are adjacent in columns (16 vs. 8 in Column 1; 16 vs. 0 in Column 2; 4 vs. 2 in Column 3).  \n- **Row 1-2**: Tiles shift down to Rows 3-4.

LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `32` and `4` shift left, no merge (different values). Result: `32|4|0|0`.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `8` and `2` shift left, no merge. Result: `8|2|0|0`.\n- **Row 2**: Tile `16` shifts left.

Empty spaces are in the right and bottom, minimizing disruption to large tiles.\n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `32` and `4` shift right. Result: `0|0|32|4`.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `8` and `2` shift right. Result: `0|0|8|2`.\n- **Row 2**: Tile `16` shifts right.

Empty spaces are in the left and bottom, which could disrupt the structure if new tiles spawn there.\n\n#### 3. UP:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles `32` (row 0) and `8` (row 1) shift up, no merge. Result: `32|8|0|0`.\n- **Column 1**: Tiles `4` (row 0) and `2` (row 1) shift up, no merge. Result: `4|2|0|0`.\n- **Column 2**: Tile `16` (row 2) shifts up.

Empty spaces are in the bottom rows, which could still disrupt merging opportunities.\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles `32` (row 0) and `8` (row 1) shift down.

Empty spaces are in the top rows, which could interfere with future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe **LEFT** move is optimal because it concentrates larger tiles (`32`, `8`, `16`) in the left column, with `32` in the top-left corner (a strategic corner). This structure minimizes disruption from new tiles (likely to spawn in the right\/bottom) and sets up potential future merges (e.g., if another `8` or `16` appears in column 0).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 32|4|0|0\nRow 1: 8|2|0|0\nRow 2: 16|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|2|0|0\n```\nKey observations:\n- The only possible merges are in Column 1, where two 2s (Row 1, Column 1 and Row 3, Column 1) can merge if aligned.\n- Larger tiles (32, 16, 8) are in the left column, suggesting a strategy to keep them in the corner for future merges.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Shifting tiles left in each row results in no merges (no adjacent equal tiles). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain. Not optimal.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Shifting tiles right in each row also results in no merges (no adjacent equal tiles). Tiles move to the right edge but do not combine. No score gain. Not optimal.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Shifting tiles up causes Column 1 (values [4, 2, 0, 2]) to shift upward. The two 2s (Row 1 and Row 3) align in Row 1 and Row 2, merging into a 4 (score +4). After merging, the board becomes:\n   ```\n   Row 0: 32|4|0|0\n   Row 1: 8|4|0|0\n   Row 2: 16|0|0|0\n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0\n   ```\n   This keeps larger tiles (32, 16, 8) in the left column (top-left corner), supporting future merges (e.g., 4s in Row 0 and Row 1 of Column 1 could merge with a subsequent LEFT move).\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Shifting tiles down causes Column 1 (values [4, 2, 0, 2]) to shift downward. The two 2s (Row 1 and Row 3) align in Row 2 and Row 3, merging into a 4 (score +4). However, this moves larger tiles (32, 8, 16) down the left column, disrupting the corner concentration of large tiles. Future merges would be harder to coordinate.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move. It merges the 2s for a score, preserves the corner concentration of large tiles, and sets up future merging opportunities.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential, score gain, and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 4 | 0 | 0\nRow 1: 8 | 4 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 4 | 0\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). The board remains mostly unchanged except for row 3, where the 4 shifts to column 0. No score gain. Not optimal.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (adjacent tiles are distinct). The board shifts tiles to the right edge, but no score gain. Not optimal.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward. Key observation: Column 1 has two 4s (row 0 and row 1). When moving up, these 4s merge into an 8 (score +8). Column 2 has a 4 in row 3, which shifts up to row 0. The resulting board after merging and shifting:\n   ```\n   Row 0: 32 | 8 | 4 | 0\n   Row 1: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0\n   Row 2: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0\n   Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n   ```\n   This consolidates larger tiles (32, 16, 8) in the top-left corner, a strategic position to build higher tiles.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward. Column 1 has two 4s (row 0 and row 1), which merge into an 8 (score +8) when shifted down. The resulting board:\n   ```\n   Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n   Row 1: 32 | 0 | 0 | 0\n   Row 2: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0\n   Row 3: 16 | 8 | 4 | 0\n   ```\n   While this also merges the 4s, larger tiles (32, 8, 16) are spread across lower rows, making it harder to consolidate them in a corner.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is better because it merges the 4s (gaining 8 points), consolidates larger tiles (32, 16, 8) in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and leaves more empty space in lower rows for future moves.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given game board. The goal is to position tiles for future merges and maintain larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|8|4|0\nRow 1: 8|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|2|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal numbers). The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 32|8|4|0  \n   Row 1: 8|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 16|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 2|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   No immediate or obvious future merges are set up.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur. The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|32|8|4  \n   Row 1: 0|0|0|8  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|16  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|2  \n   ```  \n   Larger tiles are scattered in the rightmost column, with no adjacent equals to merge.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift up, but no merges occur. The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 32|8|4|0  \n   Row 1: 8|2|0|0  \n   Row 2: 16|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   No adjacent equals are created, and larger tiles remain spread out.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift down. After shifting, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 32|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 8|8|0|0  \n   Row 3: 16|2|4|0  \n   ```  \n   Notably, row 2 now has two adjacent 8s (8|8|0|0). This sets up a future merge opportunity (e.g., a subsequent LEFT swipe would merge these 8s into 16, earning 16 points). This positions smaller tiles for strategic merging and keeps larger tiles (32, 16) in the lower-left area, a common corner strategy for 2048.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN swipe creates the best setup for future merges by placing two 8s adjacently in row 2. This aligns with the strategy of positioning smaller tiles to merge into larger ones while keeping bigger tiles in a corner.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize scoring potential, maintain strategic tile placement (e.g., large tiles in corners), and enable future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 32|0|0|0\nRow 2: 8|8|8|0\nRow 3: 16|2|4|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.\n- **Row 1**: 32 shifts left to column 0 (no merge).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles `8|8|8|0` shift left. The first two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), leaving `16|8|0|0`.\n- **Row 3**: Tiles `16|2|4|0` are already left-aligned (no merge).\n\n**Resulting Board After LEFT**:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 32|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|8|0|0\nRow 3: 16|2|4|0\n```\n- **Key Advantage**: Column 0 now has 32 (Row 1), 16 (Row 2), and 16 (Row 3). These 16s in Rows 2 and 3 are adjacent, enabling a potential merge into 32 with a subsequent UP swipe. This sets up a strategic chain for future scoring.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.\n- **Row 1**: 32 shifts right to column 3 (no merge).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles `8|8|8|0` shift right. The last two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), leaving `0|0|8|16`.\n- **Row 3**: Tiles `16|2|4|0` shift right to `0|16|2|4` (no merge).\n\n**Resulting Board After RIGHT**:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|32\nRow 2: 0|0|8|16\nRow 3: 0|16|2|4\n```\n- **Key Disadvantage**: Large tiles (32, 16) are scattered in the right column, with smaller tiles (2, 4) in Row 3, limiting future merge potential.\n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Columns processed top-to-bottom**:\n  - Column 0: Tiles `0|32|8|16` shift up to `32|8|16|0` (no merge).\n  - Column 1: Tiles `0|0|8|2` shift up to `8|2|0|0` (no merge).\n  - Column 2: Tiles `0|0|8|4` shift up to `8|4|0|0` (no merge).\n  - Column 3: All zeros; no change.\n\n**Resulting Board After UP**:\n```\nRow 0: 32|8|8|0\nRow 1: 8|2|4|0\nRow 2: 16|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n- **Key Disadvantage**: No merges occur during the move (score +0), and the 8s in Row 0 (columns 1-2) are not aligned for immediate merging in the direction of the swipe (UP).\n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Tiles are already as far down as possible (no movement or merges). This is an invalid move.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe is optimal. It merges two 8s into 16 (scoring +16), consolidates large tiles (32, 16) in Column 0, and sets up adjacent 16s in Rows 2-3 of Column 0 for future merges. This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner and enabling strategic merging.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and the goal of maximizing score and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 32|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 16|8|0|2  \nRow 3: 16|2|4|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: All zeros, no change.  \n- Row 1: 32 shifts left, remains 32|0|0|0.  \n- Row 2: 16|8|0|2 → 16|8|2|0 (no merges).  \n- Row 3: 16|2|4|0 → 16|2|4|0 (no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges, no score gain. Poor for consolidation.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: All zeros, no change.  \n- Row 1: 32 shifts right, becomes 0|0|0|32.  \n- Row 2: 16|8|0|2 → 0|16|8|2 (no merges).  \n- Row 3: 16|2|4|0 → 0|16|2|4 (no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges, no score gain.

Result: [32, 4, 0, 0].  \n- Rows 2-3: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 2+2 (score +4), but no significant merging of larger tiles (32s remain separate).  \n\n\n### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [32, 8, 4, 2] has no adjacent duplicates, so it remains unchanged.  \n- **Row 1**: [32, 2, 0, 2] shifts right, merging the two 2s into 4. Result: [32, 0, 0, 4].  \n- Rows 2-3: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 2+2 (score +4), but 32s remain separate.  \n\n\n### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [32 (row0), 32 (row1), 0, 0] merges 32+32 into 64 (score +64). Result: [64, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 1**: [8 (row0), 2 (row1), 0, 0] has no duplicates, so it shifts up: [8, 2, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 2**: [4 (row0), 0, 0, 0] shifts up: [4, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 3**: [2 (row0), 2 (row1), 0, 0] merges 2+2 into 4 (score +4). Result: [4, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Resulting Board**:  \n  Row 0: 64 | 8 | 4 | 4  \n  Row 1: 0 | 2 | 0 | 0  \n  Rows 2-3: All zeros.  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 32+32 (score +64) and 2+2 (score +4), totaling +68. The 64 is placed in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), with smaller tiles aligned in the top row for potential future merges.  \n\n\n### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [32 (row0), 32 (row1), 0, 0] merges 32+32 into 64 (score +64), shifting to the bottom: [0, 0, 0, 64].  \n- **Column 1**: [8 (row0), 2 (row1), 0, 0] shifts down: [0, 0, 2, 8].  \n- **Column 2**: [4 (row0), 0, 0, 0] shifts down: [0, 0, 0, 4].  \n- **Column 3**: [2 (row0), 2 (row1), 0, 0] merges 2+2 into 4 (score +4), shifting to the bottom: [0, 0, 0, 4].  \n- **Resulting Board**:  \n  Rows 0-1: All zeros.  \n  Row 2: 0 | 2 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 3: 64 | 8 | 4 | 4  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 32+32 (score +64) and 2+2 (score +4), totaling +68. The 64 is placed in the bottom-left corner, but the top rows are empty, reducing immediate merging potential.  \n\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nUP and DOWN both merge critical tiles (32s and 2s) for high scores. However, UP places the 64 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) with smaller tiles aligned in the top row, enabling future merges (e.g., 4+4 into 8). This aligns better with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners and maintaining merge potential.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to maximize merging opportunities, keep large tiles in a corner, and maintain flexibility for future moves.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 8 | 4 | 4\nRow 1: 0 | 2 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 4 | 0\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two `4`s in columns 2 and 3 merge into `8`, resulting in `64 | 8 | 8 | 0` (score +8).\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left, resulting in `2 | 0 | 0 | 0`.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left, resulting in `4 | 0 | 0 | 0`.\n- **Row 3**: No change.\n\n**Resulting Board**:\n```\n64 | 8 | 8 | 0\n2 | 0 | 0 | 0\n4 | 0 | 0 | 0\n0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n- Key outcome: The `64` remains in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and the merged `8`s in row 0 (columns 1-2) are adjacent, creating future merging potential (e.g., merging into `16` with another LEFT swipe). The lower rows have empty spaces to accommodate new tiles.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two `4`s in columns 2 and 3 merge into `8`, resulting in `64 | 8 | 0 | 8` (score +8).\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right, resulting in `0 | 0 | 0 | 2`.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right, resulting in `0 | 0 | 0 | 4`.\n- **Row 3**: No change.\n\n**Resulting Board**:\n```\n64 | 8 | 0 | 8\n0 | 0 | 0 | 2\n0 | 0 | 0 | 4\n0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n- Key outcome: The `8`s in row 0 (columns 1 and 3) are separated by an empty tile, reducing immediate merging potential. The `64` remains in the top-left, but the structure is less favorable for future merges.\n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: `64` stays in row 0 (no merge).\n- **Column 1**: `8` (row 0) and `2` (row 1) are unmerged, resulting in `8 | 2 | 0 | 0`.\n- **Column 2**: The `4` (row 0) and `4` (row 2) merge into `8` (row 0), resulting in `8 | 0 | 0 | 0` (score +8).\n- **Column 3**: `4` (row 0) shifts up, resulting in `4 | 0 | 0 | 0`.\n\n**Resulting Board**:\n```\n64 | 8 | 8 | 4\n0 | 2 | 0 | 0\n0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n- Key outcome: The `64` remains in the top-left, but row 0 becomes nearly full (`64 | 8 | 8 | 4`), limiting space for new tiles. The `8`s in row 0 (columns 1-2) are adjacent but overshadowed by reduced flexibility.\n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: `64` shifts down to row 3, resulting in `0 | 0 | 0 | 64`.\n- **Column 1**: `8` (row 0) shifts down to row 2, and `2` (row 1) shifts down to row 3, resulting in `0 | 0 | 8 | 2`.\n- **Column 2**: The `4` (row 0) and `4` (row 2) merge into `8` (row 3), resulting in `0 | 0 | 0 | 8` (score +8).\n- **Column 3**: `4` (row 0) shifts down to row 3, resulting in `0 | 0 | 0 | 4`.\n\n**Resulting Board**:\n```\n0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n0 | 8 | 0 | 0\n64 | 2 | 8 | 4\n```\n- Key outcome: The `64` moves to the bottom-left corner, but the lower row (`64 | 2 | 8 | 4`) has small, scattered tiles with no immediate merging potential. This reduces strategic flexibility.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe **LEFT** swipe is optimal. It keeps the largest tile (`64`) in the top-left corner, merges the `4`s into an `8` (creating adjacent `8`s for future merging), and leaves empty spaces in lower rows to accommodate new tiles. This structure maximizes future merging opportunities and maintains strategic control.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic placement of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\n64|8|8|0\n2|32|0|0\n4|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - **Top Row**: `64|8|8|0` shifts left. The two `8`s merge into `16` (score +16), resulting in `64|16|0|0`.  \n   - **Second Row**: `2|32|0|0` shifts left to `2|32|0|0` (no merging).  \n   - **Third Row**: `4|0|0|0` shifts left to `4|0|0|0` (no merging).  \n   - **Fourth Row**: No change.  \n   - Result: Larger tiles (`64`, `16`, `32`, `4`) are consolidated left, with the largest tile (`64`) in the top-left corner (a strategic corner).  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - **Top Row**: `64|8|8|0` shifts right.

All columns (`64|2|4|0`, `8|32|0|0`, `8|0|0|0`, `0|0|0|0`) have no adjacent equal tiles and no empty spaces to shift tiles upward. No movement or merging occurs.  \n   - Result: Invalid move (no tiles shift or merge).  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - **First Column**: `64|2|4|0` shifts down to `0|64|2|4` (no merging).  \n   - **Second Column**: `8|32|0|0` shifts down to `0|0|8|32` (no merging).  \n   - **Third Column**: `8|0|0|0` shifts down to `0|0|0|8` (no merging).  \n   - **Fourth Column**: No change.  \n   - Result: Tiles shift but no merging occurs, and larger tiles are scattered.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe **LEFT** move merges the two `8`s into `16` (gaining 16 points) and consolidates larger tiles in the left column, keeping the largest tile (`64`) in the top-left corner (a strategic position).

The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|64|16  \n   Row 1: 0|0|2|64  \n   Row 2: 0|0|4|32  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   Larger tiles (64s, 32) cluster on the right but are not in a corner, limiting future merge potential.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift up, but no merges occur. The 32 in Row 2, Column 3 moves to Row 0, Column 3 (top-right corner). The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 64|16|0|32  \n   Row 1: 2|64|0|0  \n   Row 2: 4|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   The 32 is in a corner, but the 64s (Row 0, Column 0; Row 1, Column 1) are diagonal and not aligned for future merges.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift down, but no merges occur. The 32 in Row 2, Column 3 moves to Row 3, Column 3 (bottom-right corner). The 64 in Row 1, Column 1 moves to Row 3, Column 1, and smaller tiles (2, 4) shift down. The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 64|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 2|16|0|0  \n   Row 3: 4|64|0|32  \n   ```  \n   The 32 is in the bottom-right corner (a strategic corner), and the 64 in Row 3, Column 1 is positioned to potentially merge with future tiles. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners for stability.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhile no immediate merges are possible, the DOWN swipe optimally positions the 32 in the bottom-right corner and aligns the 64 in Row 3, Column 1 for future merges. This direction best follows the strategy of cornering larger tiles.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to strategically position tiles to enable future merges and maximize scoring potential.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 64|4|0|0\nRow 2: 2|16|0|0\nRow 3: 4|64|0|32\n```\nKey observations:\n- Larger tiles (64, 32) are scattered, with 32 in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3).\n- Many empty tiles (9 zeros) allow flexibility, but no immediate merges are possible (no adjacent equal tiles).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. Row 3 becomes `4|64|32|0`, and other rows remain mostly unchanged. This does not meaningfully group larger tiles or create opportunities for future merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, pushing non-zero tiles toward the right edge:\n   - Row 1: `0|0|64|4` (64 and 4 move right).\n   - Row 2: `0|0|2|16` (2 and 16 move right).\n   - Row 3: `0|4|64|32` (4, 64, 32 shift right, with 32 already in the bottom-right corner).  \n   This groups tiles on the right, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (e.g., 32 in the bottom-right, 64 adjacent to it). This setup increases the likelihood of future merges (e.g., if another 64 or 32 appears nearby).\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up, but no merges occur. Row 0 becomes `64|4|0|32`, spreading larger tiles (64, 32) across the top row. This scatters tiles and reduces the potential for corner-based merging.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down, but no changes occur (board remains identical to the original). This move is ineffective.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT groups tiles toward the right edge, positioning the 32 in the bottom-right corner and aligning 64 adjacent to it. This strategy supports future merges by concentrating larger tiles in a corner, making RIGHT the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to merge tiles for higher scores and position larger tiles strategically (preferably in a corner).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|64|4\nRow 2: 16|0|2|16\nRow 3: 0|4|64|32\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: Remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 1: Shifts to `64|4|0|0` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: Shifts to `16|2|16|0` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: Shifts to `4|64|32|0` (no merges).  \n   - No merges occur, and larger tiles (64, 32) are scattered.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: Remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 1: Remains `0|0|64|4` (no shifts possible).  \n   - Row 2: Shifts to `0|16|2|16` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: Remains `0|4|64|32` (no shifts possible).  \n   - No merges occur, and larger tiles stay scattered.  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed to shift tiles downward.  \n   - Column 0: Shifts to `0|0|0|16`.  \n   - Column 1: Shifts to `0|0|0|4`.  \n   - Column 2: Shifts to `0|64|2|64` (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: Shifts to `0|4|16|32` (no merges).  \n   - No merges occur, and the board structure remains largely unchanged.  \n\n4. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed to shift tiles upward.  \n   - Column 0: Shifts to `16|0|0|0`.  \n   - Column 1: Shifts to `4|0|0|0`.  \n   - Column 2: Shifts to `64|2|64|0` (no merges, but 64s align vertically).  \n   - Column 3: Shifts to `4|16|32|0` (no merges).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 16|4|64|4  \n     Row 1: 0|0|2|16  \n     Row 2: 0|0|64|32  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - Larger tiles (64, 32) are positioned in the bottom-right corner (row 2, columns 2-3), which aligns with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in a corner for future merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping **UP** positions larger tiles (64, 32) in the bottom-right corner, setting up for potential future merges while avoiding scattering of large tiles. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

Merging 16s into 32 in the **bottom-left corner (DOWN)** aligns with this strategy, as it positions the 32 in a corner for potential future merges.

Not a valid move.\n\n2. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: No change (all zeros).  \n   - Row 1: [0,16,64,4] → [16,64,4,0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,2,16] → [2,16,0,0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [32,4,64,32] → [32,4,64,32] (no merges).  \n   Valid (tiles shift), but no merges.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,0,0,32] → remains [0,0,0,32] (no movement).  \n   - Column 1: [0,16,0,4] → [0,0,16,4] (16 shifts down to row 2).  \n   - Column 2: [0,64,2,64] → remains [0,64,2,64] (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [0,4,16,32] → remains [0,4,16,32] (no movement).  \n   Valid (tiles shift), but no merges.\n\n4. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,0,0,32] → [32,0,0,0] (32 shifts up to row 0).  \n   - Column 1: [0,16,0,4] → [16,4,0,0] (16 and 4 shift up to rows 0 and 1).  \n   - Column 2: [0,64,2,64] → [64,2,64,0] (64, 2, 64 shift up to rows 0, 1, 2).  \n   - Column 3: [0,4,16,32] → [4,16,32,0] (4, 16, 32 shift up to rows 0, 1, 2).  \n   Valid (tiles shift), no merges, but row 3 becomes completely empty.  \n\n\n### Strategy Consideration:  \nThe key strategy is to keep larger tiles in a corner and maintain empty spaces for new tiles. Swiping UP moves larger tiles (32, 16, 64) to the top rows and leaves row 3 completely empty. This creates space for new small tiles (2 or 4) to spawn in row 3, avoiding interference with larger tiles in the top rows. This positions the board for future merging opportunities.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

Score gain: 0.  \n   - Result: No meaningful changes; larger tiles remain scattered.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (all tiles in each row are distinct). Score gain: 0.  \n   - Result: No meaningful changes; larger tiles remain scattered.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom. In Column 1 (values: 16, 4, 4, 0), the two 4s merge into 8 (score +8).  \n   - Other columns have no merges.  \n   - Result: Larger tiles (32, 16, 64) remain in the top row, with some smaller tiles shifted upward. Empty space remains in Row 3.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom to top. In Column 1 (values: 16, 4, 4, 0), the two 4s merge into 8 (score +8).  \n   - Column 0 (32, 0, 0, 0) shifts down, moving the 32 to the bottom-left corner (Row 3, Column 0).  \n   - Column 2 (64, 2, 64, 0) shifts down, aligning 64s in Row 1 and Row 3 (separated by 2, no merge).  \n   - Result: Larger tiles (32, 16, 64) consolidate in the bottom row (Row 3), with empty space in Row 0. This positions larger tiles in a corner, a strategic advantage for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and DOWN yield an 8-point score, but DOWN is superior because it consolidates larger tiles (32, 16, 64) in the bottom row, aligning them in a corner.

No merges occur in any column.  \n   - Resulting 0s: Row 0 (col 2 and col 3), which are top corners (less ideal for larger tiles).  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\n- No merges are possible in any direction, so the focus shifts to positioning 0s in strategic corners to facilitate future merges.  \n- LEFT and RIGHT swipes leave 0s in the bottom-right corner (Row 3, col 3), which is ideal for consolidating larger tiles (e.g., 32, 64) in corners.  \n- Between LEFT and RIGHT, LEFT is marginally better as it maintains the existing alignment of larger tiles (e.g., 32 in Row 0, col 0) without disrupting their positions.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and the goal of maximizing score and setting up future merges. The game board is:\n\n```\n32|16|64|4\n2|4|2|16\n16|64|32|0\n8|16|32|32\n```\n\n### LEFT\n- **Row 0**: 32, 16, 64, 4 (no merges, remains unchanged).  \n- **Row 1**: 2, 4, 2, 16 (no merges, remains unchanged).  \n- **Row 2**: 16, 64, 32, 0 (no merges, shifts left to 16|64|32|0).  \n- **Row 3**: 8, 16, 32, 32 (two 32s merge into 64, resulting in 8|16|64|0).  \n- **Score**: 64 (from merging 32+32=64).  \n- **Larger tiles**: 64s at (0,2), (2,1), (3,2).  \n\n### RIGHT\n- **Row 0**: 32, 16, 64, 4 (no merges, remains unchanged).  \n- **Row 1**: 2, 4, 2, 16 (no merges, remains unchanged).  \n- **Row 2**: 16, 64, 32, 0 (shifts right to 0|16|64|32).  \n- **Row 3**: 8, 16, 32, 32 (two 32s merge into 64, resulting in 0|8|16|64).  \n- **Score**: 64 (from merging 32+32=64).  \n- **Larger tiles**: 64s at (0,2), (2,2), (3,3).  \n\n### UP\n- **Column 0**: 32, 2, 16, 8 (no merges, remains unchanged).  \n- **Column 1**: 16, 4, 64, 16 (no merges, remains unchanged).  \n- **Column 2**: 64, 2, 32, 32 (two 32s merge into 64, resulting in 64|2|64|0).  \n- **Column 3**: 4, 16, 0, 32 (no merges, shifts up to 4|16|32|0).  \n- **Score**: 64 (from merging 32+32=64).  \n- **Larger tiles**: 64s at (0,2), (2,1), (2,2) (two 64s adjacent in row 2, which can merge in a future left swipe).  \n\n### DOWN\n- **Column 0**: 32, 2, 16, 8 (no merges, shifts down to 0|32|2|16).  \n- **Column 1**: 16, 4, 64, 16 (no merges, shifts down to 0|16|4|64).  \n- **Column 2**: 64, 2, 32, 32 (two 32s merge into 64, resulting in 0|64|2|64).  \n- **Column 3**: 4, 16, 0, 32 (no merges, shifts down to 0|4|16|32).  \n- **Score**: 64 (from merging 32+32=64).  \n- **Larger tiles**: 64s spread across rows 1 and 3, with no immediate merge potential.  \n\n### Optimal Move\nWhile all directions yield 64 points, **UP** is the best choice. After swiping up, row 2 has two adjacent 64s (at positions (2,1) and (2,2)), which can merge in a future left swipe to form a 128. This setup aligns with the strategy of grouping larger tiles to enable future merges, making UP the most strategic move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 64 | 4\nRow 1: 2 | 4 | 2 | 16\nRow 2: 16 | 64 | 64 | 32\nRow 3: 8 | 16 | 4 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles are distinct; no merge.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles are distinct; no merge.  \n   - Row 2: The two adjacent 64s merge into 128. New row: `16 | 128 | 32 | 0`.  \n   - Row 3: Tiles shift left but no merge.  \n   - Result: Merges 64s in Row 2, yielding 128 points. The 128 tile is in Row 2, Column 1 (middle-left).\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles are distinct; no merge.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles are distinct; no merge.  \n   - Row 2: The two adjacent 64s merge into 128. New row: `0 | 16 | 128 | 32`.  \n   - Row 3: Tiles shift right (0 moves to Column 0). New row: `0 | 8 | 16 | 4`.  \n   - Result: Merges 64s in Row 2, yielding 128 points. The 128 tile is in Row 2, Column 2 (middle-right, closer to the bottom-right corner).\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: Tiles are distinct; no merge.  \n   - Column 1: Tiles are distinct; no merge.  \n   - Column 2: The two 64s (Row 0 and Row 2) merge into 128. New column: `128 | 2 | 4 | 0`.  \n   - Column 3: Tiles are distinct; no merge.  \n   - Result: Merges 64s in Column 2, yielding 128 points. The 128 tile is in Row 0, Column 2 (top-middle).\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - No adjacent equal tiles in any column. Tiles shift down but no merges occur.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe key strategy is to keep larger tiles in a corner for future merges. Swiping RIGHT positions the new 128 tile in Row 2, Column 2 (closer to the bottom-right corner), which aligns with corner-based strategy. This placement leaves room to push larger tiles toward the bottom-right corner in subsequent moves, enhancing future merge potential.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|16|64|4\nRow 1: 2|4|2|16\nRow 2: 0|16|128|32\nRow 3: 64|8|16|4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles are all distinct (32, 16, 64, 4) → no shifts or merges.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles are all distinct (2, 4, 2, 16) → no shifts or merges.  \n   - **Row 2**: Shifts left, moving non-zero tiles to the left: `0|16|128|32` → `16|128|32|0` (no merges, but creates a zero in column 3).  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles are all distinct (64, 8, 16, 4) → no shifts or merges.  \n   - **Outcome**: No immediate merges, but row 2 now has a zero in column 3. This empty space could allow a new 32 to spawn next to the existing 32 in column 2, enabling a merge in the next move.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles are all distinct → no shifts or merges.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles are all distinct → no shifts or merges.  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles are already right-aligned (`0|16|128|32`) → no shifts or merges.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles are all distinct → no shifts or merges.  \n   - **Outcome**: No changes to the board structure; no new opportunities for merging.  \n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles (32, 2, 0, 64) shift up → `32|2|64|0` (no merges).  \n   - **Column 1**: Tiles (16, 4, 16, 8) are distinct → no shifts or merges.  \n   - **Column 2**: Tiles (64, 2, 128, 16) are distinct → no shifts or merges.  \n   - **Column 3**: Tiles (4, 16, 32, 4) are distinct → no shifts or merges.  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges; the 128 remains in the center, with no clear path to corner positioning.  \n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles (32, 2, 0, 64) shift down → `0|32|2|64` (no merges).  \n   - **Column 1**: Tiles (16, 4, 16, 8) are distinct → no shifts or merges.  \n   - **Column 2**: Tiles (64, 2, 128, 16) are distinct → no shifts or merges.  \n   - **Column 3**: Tiles (4, 16, 32, 4) are distinct → no shifts or merges.  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges; the 128 remains in the center, with limited future merging potential.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe LEFT move is optimal because it shifts the 128 in row 2 closer to the left edge and creates a zero in row 2, column 3. This empty space increases the likelihood of spawning a 32 next to the existing 32 in row 2, column 2, enabling a merge in subsequent moves. This aligns with the strategy of positioning larger tiles for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize merges and set up future opportunities for higher scores.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 64 | 4  \nRow 1: 2 | 4 | 2 | 16  \nRow 2: 16 | 128 | 32 | 16  \nRow 3: 64 | 8 | 16 | 4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   - Swiping LEFT or RIGHT does not result in any merges. All tiles in each row are distinct and cannot combine, so these moves provide no immediate score and do not improve the board state.  \n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - Swiping UP causes a merge in Column 3 (rows 1 and 2), where two 16s combine into a 32 (score +32). After merging, Column 3 becomes [4, 32, 4, 0]. However, no other tiles merge, and the 32 in row 1, column 3 has no adjacent 32s for future merges.  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Swiping DOWN also merges the two 16s in Column 3 (rows 1 and 2) into a 32 (score +32). After merging, Column 3 becomes [0, 4, 32, 4]. Notably, in Row 2, the merged 32 (column 3) is now adjacent to the existing 32 in column 2 (Row 2: [16, 128, 32, 32]). This creates a critical opportunity for a future merge (e.g., swiping RIGHT to combine these two 32s into a 64), which is a strategic advantage.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move because it merges the 16s in Column 3 (providing immediate score) and sets up adjacent 32s in Row 2, enabling a future merge for higher scores. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, score gain, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 64 | 64  \nRow 1: 2 | 4 | 2 | 4  \nRow 2: 16 | 128 | 32 | 32  \nRow 3: 64 | 8 | 16 | 4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: [32, 16, 64, 64] → Tiles shift left, merging the two 64s into 128.

New row: [0, 32, 16, 128]. Score: 128.  \n- **Row 1**: [2, 4, 2, 4] → No merges (all distinct). New row: [2, 4, 2, 4]. Score: 0.  \n- **Row 2**: [16, 128, 32, 32] → Tiles shift right, merging the two 32s into 64. New row: [16, 128, 0, 64]. Score: 64.  \n- **Row 3**: [64, 8, 16, 4] → No merges (all distinct). New row: [64, 8, 16, 4]. Score: 0.  \n- **Total Score**: 128 + 64 = 192.  \n- **Larger Tiles Positioning**: 128 (row 0, column 3) is in the top-right corner, which is strategically advantageous for keeping large tiles in corners.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- All columns have distinct values (no adjacent duplicates). No merges occur. Score: 0.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- All columns have distinct values (no adjacent duplicates). No merges occur. Score: 0.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 192 points, but RIGHT positions the 128 tile in the top-right corner, which aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners to minimize disruption in future moves.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|32|16|128\nRow 1: 2|4|2|4\nRow 2: 32|16|128|64\nRow 3: 64|8|16|4\n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Shifts tiles left to `[32, 16, 128, 0]` (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `[2, 4, 2, 4]` have no adjacent equal values (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles `[32, 16, 128, 64]` are all distinct (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles `[64, 8, 16, 4]` are all distinct (no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges, minimal tile movement.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `[0, 32, 16, 128]` cannot shift further right (no change).\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `[2, 4, 2, 4]` have no adjacent equal values (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles `[32, 16, 128, 64]` are all distinct (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles `[64, 8, 16, 4]` are all distinct (no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges, no meaningful movement.\n\n### UP Move:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles `[0, 2, 32, 64]` shift up to `[2, 32, 64, 0]` (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: Tiles `[32, 4, 16, 8]` are all distinct (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: Tiles `[16, 2, 128, 16]` are all distinct (no merges).\n- **Column 3**: Tiles `[128, 4, 64, 4]` are all distinct (no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges, minimal tile movement.\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- **Column 3**: Tiles `[128, 4, 64, 4]` shift down. The 128 (row 0) moves to the bottom (row 3, column 3), positioning the largest tile in the bottom-right corner (strategic corner placement).\n- **Other Columns**: No merges, but larger tiles (e.g., 128) are moved toward corners, aligning with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in corners for future merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile no immediate merges occur, the DOWN move strategically positions the 128 tile in the bottom-right corner, a critical corner for future merges. This aligns with the goal of keeping larger tiles in corners to maximize long-term merging potential.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile movement. The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number to merge.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4 | 32 | 16 | 128  \nRow 1: 2 | 4 | 2 | 4  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 128 | 64  \nRow 3: 64 | 8 | 16 | 4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All rows have no adjacent duplicates. For example, Row 1 (2, 4, 2, 4) has no adjacent equal tiles, so no merges. Tiles cannot shift left (grid is full). **Invalid**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Similarly, all rows have no adjacent duplicates.

All moves are invalid, but the problem requires selecting one of the four options. Given the constraints, a direction must be chosen. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of merging adjacent equal tiles and shifting tiles toward the edge of the grid. The current game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 4|32|16|128  \nRow 1: 2|4|2|4  \nRow 2: 32|16|128|64  \nRow 3: 64|8|16|4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows are already left-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 1 (`2|4|2|4`) has no adjacent duplicates, so no merging occurs. No tiles shift, and no score is gained.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - All rows are already right-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 1 (`2|4|2|4`) remains unchanged when shifted right, as no adjacent duplicates exist. No merging or shifting occurs.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - All columns are checked for vertical merges. For example, Column 3 (`128|4|64|4`) has no adjacent equal tiles (4s are separated by 64). Similarly, other columns (e.g., Column 2: `16|2|128|16`) have no adjacent duplicates. No merging or vertical shifts occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - All columns are checked for vertical merges. For example, Column 3 (`128|4|64|4`) has 4s separated by 64, so no merge. Column 2 (`16|2|128|16`) has 16s separated by 2 and 128, so no merge. Other columns also lack adjacent equal tiles. No merging or vertical shifts occur.  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The grid is **completely full** (no empty tiles, 0s).  \n- No adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value, so no merges are possible.  \n- By the rules, a valid move requires either adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to shift into. Since neither condition is met, there are no valid moves.  \n\n\nGiven the requirement to select one of the four directions, and no valid moves available, any direction is technically invalid. However, based on the problem constraints, we must choose from the options. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the validity of each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or moving tiles into empty spaces.

Since no direction leads to a merge or meaningful shift, any direction is technically a valid input (though the game would end soon after due to no valid moves).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of merging tiles and shifting them. The goal is to identify a direction that allows merging tiles to increase the score.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 4|32|16|128\nRow 1: 2|4|2|4\nRow 2: 32|16|128|64\nRow 3: 64|8|16|4\n```\nAll tiles are non-zero (the grid is full), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number (horizontally or vertically) to merge.\n\n### Direction Evaluation:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   - For LEFT: All rows have distinct adjacent tiles (e.g., Row 0: 4, 32, 16, 128; Row 1: 2, 4, 2, 4). No merges possible.  \n   - For RIGHT: Similarly, all rows have distinct adjacent tiles. No merges possible.  \n   - Both directions result in no tile movement or merging, making them invalid.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are checked vertically. All columns have distinct adjacent tiles (e.g., Column 0: 4, 2, 32, 64; Column 1: 32, 4, 16, 8). No merges possible.  \n   - No tile movement or merging occurs, making UP invalid.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are checked vertically, with tiles shifted downward. Key analysis focuses on Column 3:  \n     - Column 3: [128 (Row 0), 4 (Row 1), 64 (Row 2), 4 (Row 3)].  \n     - When shifting down, the 4 in Row 1 moves past 64 (Row 2) to Row 2, and 64 shifts up to Row 1. This results in Column 3 becoming [128, 64, 4, 4].  \n     - The two 4s in Row 2 and Row 3 are now adjacent and merge into 8. After merging, the 8 occupies Row 3, and the remaining tiles (128, 64) shift down to fill empty spaces.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly the DOWN direction allows merging (two 4s in Column 3 merge into 8), making it a valid move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning. The current game board has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value to merge. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 4 | 32 | 16 | 128  \nRow 1: 2 | 4 | 2 | 4  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 128 | 64  \nRow 3: 64 | 8 | 16 | 4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows have distinct adjacent tiles (no duplicates). For example, Row 1: [2, 4, 2, 4] has no adjacent duplicates. No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift left (grid is full).  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Similarly, all rows have distinct adjacent tiles. For example, Row 1 reversed: [4, 2, 4, 2] still has no adjacent duplicates. No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift right (grid is full).  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - All columns have distinct adjacent tiles. For example, Column 2: [16, 2, 128, 16] has no adjacent duplicates (16s are separated by 2 and 128). No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift up (grid is full).  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - All columns have distinct adjacent tiles. For example, Column 3: [128, 4, 64, 4] has no adjacent duplicates (4s are separated by 64). No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift down (grid is full).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no empty tiles, and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. This means no valid merges are possible in any direction. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and all moves are equivalently invalid, we choose arbitrarily.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merges and valid moves.

The goal is to identify valid moves that allow merging tiles or moving into empty spaces.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 4 | 32 | 16 | 128  \nRow 1: 2 | 4 | 2 | 4  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 128 | 64  \nRow 3: 64 | 8 | 16 | 4  \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty spaces**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no zeros), so valid moves must involve merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **Adjacent tile check**: For a move to be valid, there must be at least one pair of adjacent tiles (in the direction of the swipe) with the same value.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Each row is processed leftward. No adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., Row 0: 4, 32, 16, 128; Row 1: 2, 4, 2, 4). No merges occur, and no tiles shift (no empty spaces to fill). **No valid merges**.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Each row is processed rightward.

No merges occur, and no tiles shift. **No valid merges**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions lack adjacent tiles of the same value and have no empty spaces, meaning no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the most neutral choice (with no immediate negative impact) is selected.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules.

All tiles in every row are distinct and already left-aligned (no empty spaces). No merging or movement occurs. **Invalid**.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Each row is processed right-to-left. All tiles in every row are distinct and already right-aligned (no empty spaces). No merging or movement occurs. **Invalid**.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Each column is processed top-to-bottom. All columns are full (no empty spaces), and no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. No merging or movement occurs. **Invalid**.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Each column is processed bottom-to-top. All columns are full (no empty spaces), and no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. No merging or movement occurs. **Invalid**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is completely full (no empty tiles), and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. Thus, there are no valid moves. However, per the problem constraints, the answer must be one of the four directions. Since all moves are invalid, but a direction must be chosen, we select arbitrarily.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile alignment.

Row 1 (2,4,2,4) has alternating 2s and 4s, but no adjacent duplicates.\n   - **Columns**: Column 0 (4,2,32,64), Column 1 (32,4,16,8), Column 2 (16,2,128,16), Column 3 (128,4,64,4) also have no adjacent duplicates.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Shifting left or right in any row leaves tiles unchanged (no merges, no empty spaces to shift into).\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Shifting up or down in any column also leaves tiles unchanged (no merges, no empty spaces to shift into).\n\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid merges, any direction is functionally equivalent, but we choose **LEFT** as a default.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or tile movements in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number to merge.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 4 | 32 | 16 | 128  \nRow 1: 2 | 4 | 2 | 4  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 128 | 64  \nRow 3: 64 | 8 | 16 | 4  \n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: All rows have distinct adjacent tiles (no two equal adjacent tiles).

Swiping down would not merge any tiles, and no tiles would shift (grid is full).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied, and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number in any direction. Thus, no valid moves are possible.  \n\nAnswer: NO_VALID_MOVE  \n\nWait, but the problem specifies the answer must be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP', 'DOWN'. Since no valid moves exist, but the question requires selecting from these options, there might be an error. However, based on the rules, the game ends when no valid moves are left, but the answer format requires one of the four. Assuming a possible oversight, but strictly following analysis, there are no valid moves.  \n\nAnswer: (No valid move, but per instructions, must choose one. However, based on the grid, no direction works. If forced to pick, perhaps default, but no correct option.)  \n\nBut according to the problem's example, the answer must be one of the four. Since all directions are invalid, but the user expects an answer, perhaps the intended answer is a direction. However, based on the analysis, no direction is valid.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT (or any, but no correct option)  \n\nBut this is incorrect. The correct conclusion is no valid moves, but per the problem's constraints, the answer must be one of the four. Given the grid, the answer is that no direction is valid, but since the options don't include that, perhaps the answer is a direction (e.g., LEFT) as a placeholder.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the validity of each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. A valid move requires either adjacent tiles of the same number (which can merge) or empty spaces (0s) to shift tiles into. The current board has no empty spaces (all tiles are non-zero), so validity depends on the presence of adjacent same-numbered tiles that can merge.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 32 | 16 | 128  \nRow 1: 2 | 4 | 2 | 4  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 128 | 64  \nRow 3: 64 | 8 | 16 | 4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Each row is checked for adjacent same-numbered tiles.  \n   - Row 0: 4, 32, 16, 128 (no adjacent matches).  \n   - Row 1: 2, 4, 2, 4 (no adjacent matches).  \n   - Row 2: 32, 16, 128, 64 (no adjacent matches).  \n   - Row 3: 64, 8, 16, 4 (no adjacent matches).  \n   No merges or shifts are possible. **Invalid**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Similar to LEFT, but tiles shift right.

However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.

For example:  \n  - Row 1 has `2, 4, 2, 4`, but the 2s and 4s are not adjacent.  \n  - Column 2 has `16, 2, 128, 16`, but the 16s are separated by other tiles.  \n  - All other rows and columns similarly lack adjacent duplicates.  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Tiles cannot merge (no adjacent duplicates) and will not shift (grid is full). The board remains unchanged.  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: Tiles cannot merge (no adjacent duplicates) and will not shift (grid is full). The board remains unchanged.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves are invalid under the rules (no adjacent duplicates or empty spaces to shift into). However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we choose based on strategic positioning (e.g., keeping larger tiles in corners). The 128s (largest tiles) are in (0,3) and (2,2). A LEFT move keeps them in place, maintaining their corner-like positions.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for possible merges in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: [4, 32, 16, 128]  \nRow 1: [2, 4, 2, 4]  \nRow 2: [32, 16, 128, 64]  \nRow 3: [64, 8, 16, 4]  \n\n\n### LEFT Swipe:\nEach row is processed left-to-right. All tiles in every row are distinct and already left-aligned. No merges occur.  \n\n### RIGHT Swipe:\nEach row is processed right-to-left. All tiles in every row are distinct and already right-aligned. No merges occur.  \n\n\n### UP Swipe:\nEach column is processed top-to-bottom. All columns have distinct tiles with no adjacent duplicates. No merges occur.  \n\n\n### DOWN Swipe:\nEach column is processed bottom-to-top. We focus on **Column 3** (values: [128, 4, 64, 4]):  \n- The two 4s (at row 1 and row 3) are separated by 64 (row 2). When swiping down, the 4 at row 1 shifts past 64 to merge with the 4 at row 3, forming an 8. This merge is valid and generates a score of 8.  \n\nOther columns have no merges, but Column 3’s merge makes DOWN the only direction with a valid move.  \n\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of tile movement and merging. The current board has no empty tiles (0s), and all adjacent tiles (horizontally and vertically) are distinct. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **No Empty Tiles**: All tiles are occupied (no 0s), so movement requires merging adjacent equal tiles to create space.\n2. **No Adjacent Equal Tiles**: Checking all rows and columns, there are no adjacent tiles with the same value.

When swiping down, the top 16 (Row 0) shifts past 2 (Row 1) and 128 (Row 2) to merge with the bottom 16 (Row 3), forming 32. This creates an empty space in Row 0, Column 2.  \n   - **Column 3**: Tiles [128 (Row 0), 4 (Row 1), 64 (Row 2), 4 (Row 3)]. When swiping down, the top 4 (Row 1) shifts past 64 (Row 2) to merge with the bottom 4 (Row 3), forming 8.

For example:  \n   - Row 0: 4, 32, 16, 128 (all distinct).  \n   - Row 1: 2, 4, 2, 4 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n   - Columns (e.g., Column 3: 128, 4, 64, 4) also have no adjacent duplicates.  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Swiping left or right shifts tiles to the edge of the row. Since all rows are full and no adjacent tiles are equal, no merging occurs, and tiles cannot shift (no empty spaces). These moves are invalid.  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: Swiping up or down shifts tiles to the edge of the column. Similarly, all columns are full, and no adjacent tiles are equal. No merging or movement occurs. These moves are also invalid.  \n\n\nSince the grid is full with no adjacent equal tiles, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.

The goal is to identify valid moves where tiles can merge or shift into empty spaces. The current board has no empty tiles (all tiles are non-zero), so a valid move requires adjacent tiles of the same value that can merge when shifted.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 32 | 16 | 128  \nRow 1: 2 | 4 | 2 | 4  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 128 | 64  \nRow 3: 64 | 8 | 16 | 4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Each row is processed to shift tiles left. All tiles in every row are distinct (no adjacent equal values). For example:  \n     - Row 0: [4, 32, 16, 128] (no merges).  \n     - Row 1: [2, 4, 2, 4] (no merges).  \n     - Row 2: [32, 16, 128, 64] (no merges).  \n     - Row 3: [64, 8, 16, 4] (no merges).  \n   - No merges occur, and the grid remains unchanged. Invalid move.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row is processed to shift tiles right. All tiles in every row are distinct (no adjacent equal values). For example:  \n     - Row 0: [4, 32, 16, 128] (no merges).  \n     - Row 1: [2, 4, 2, 4] (no merges).  \n     - Row 2: [32, 16, 128, 64] (no merges).  \n     - Row 3: [64, 8, 16, 4] (no merges).  \n   - No merges occur, and the grid remains unchanged. Invalid move.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Each column is processed to shift tiles up. All tiles in every column are distinct (no adjacent equal values). For example:  \n     - Column 0: [4, 2, 32, 64] (no merges).  \n     - Column 1: [32, 4, 16, 8] (no merges).  \n     - Column 2: [16, 2, 128, 16] (no merges).  \n     - Column 3: [128, 4, 64, 4] (no merges).  \n   - No merges occur, and the grid remains unchanged. Invalid move.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Each column is processed to shift tiles down. All tiles in every column are distinct (no adjacent equal values). For example:  \n     - Column 0: [4, 2, 32, 64] (no merges).  \n     - Column 1: [32, 4, 16, 8] (no merges).  \n     - Column 2: [16, 2, 128, 16] (no merges).  \n     - Column 3: [128, 4, 64, 4] (no merges).  \n   - No merges occur, and the grid remains unchanged. Invalid move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full (no empty tiles), and no adjacent tiles of the same value exist in any row or column. Thus, **no valid moves** are available.

No two adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value, so no merges are possible regardless of the direction chosen.  \n- **Grid is Full**: There are no empty tiles (0s), meaning shifting tiles in any direction will not create empty spaces (since all tiles are already packed with no gaps).  \n- **Epoch Consideration**: The current epoch is 97, with 3 epochs remaining. Since no merges are possible, the goal is to choose a direction that minimally disrupts the board’s structure, ideally keeping larger tiles (e.g., 128, 64) in corners to preserve future merging potential.  \n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: None of these moves will result in tile merges or significant shifts, as the grid is full and all tiles are distinct.

The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: LEFT'\nRules:The game is played on a 4x4 grid, with each tile containing a number that is a power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048). Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n4|32|16|128\n2|4|2|4\n32|16|128|64\n64|8|16|4\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The goal is to position tiles for future merges and follow strategic principles (e.g., keeping larger tiles in a corner).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe initial board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|2|0|0  → 2 at (0,1)\nRow 1: 0|0|2|0  → 2 at (1,2)\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  → All empty\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  → All empty\n```\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,2,0,0] → shifts to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,2,0] → shifts to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Result: 2s at (0,0) and (1,0) (same column, not adjacent). No immediate merge, and tiles are spread vertically.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,2,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,2] (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,2,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,2] (no merge).  \n   - Result: 2s at (0,3) and (1,3) (same column, not adjacent). No immediate merge, and tiles are spread vertically.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 1 (vertical): [2,0,0,0] → 2 stays at (0,1).  \n   - Column 2 (vertical): [0,2,0,0] → 2 shifts up to (0,2).  \n   - Result: 2s at (0,1) and (0,2) (same row, adjacent). No immediate merge, but positioned for a future left swipe to merge them.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 1 (vertical): [2,0,0,0] → 2 shifts down to (3,1).  \n   - Column 2 (vertical): [0,2,0,0] → 2 shifts down to (3,2).  \n   - Result: 2s at (3,1) and (3,2) (same row, adjacent). No immediate merge, but positioned for a future right swipe to merge them.  \n\n### Strategic Choice:\nWhile both UP and DOWN position 2s adjacently in the same row, UP aligns better with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (top row). The 2s at (0,1) and (0,2) in row 0 are primed for a left swipe in the next move to merge into a 4, which is more favorable than positioning them in the bottom row (DOWN).\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|2|2|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### **1. Swipe LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0, 2, 2, 0] → Tiles shift left, merging the two adjacent 2s into a 4. Result: [4, 0, 0, 0]. Score +4.  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 0, 2] → Tiles shift left, moving the 2 to the first position. Result: [2, 0, 0, 0].  \n- Rows 2 and 3 remain unchanged (all zeros).  \n\nAfter swiping LEFT, the grid (before adding a new tile) becomes:  \n4|0|0|0  \n2|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n\nThis move merges two 2s into a 4, generating immediate score and positioning tiles to potentially merge further in future moves.  \n\n\n### **2. Swipe RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0, 2, 2, 0] → Tiles shift right, merging the two adjacent 2s into a 4. Result: [0, 0, 0, 4]. Score +4.  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 0, 2] → Tiles shift right, leaving the 2 in the last position. Result: [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n- Rows 2 and 3 remain unchanged (all zeros).  \n\nAfter swiping RIGHT, the grid (before adding a new tile) becomes:  \n0|0|0|4  \n0|0|0|2  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n\nWhile this also merges two 2s, the merged 4 and the 2 in Row 1 are positioned on the right edge, which is less strategic for future merges compared to LEFT.  \n\n\n### **3. Swipe UP**  \n- Columns are processed vertically. Tiles shift upward, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column to merge.  \n- **Column 1**: [2, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts to [2, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 2**: [2, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts to [2, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 3**: [0, 2, 0, 0] → Shifts to [2, 0, 0, 0].  \n\nAfter swiping UP, the grid (before adding a new tile) becomes:  \n0|2|2|2  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n\nNo merges occur, so no score is gained.  \n\n\n### **4. Swipe DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed vertically. Tiles shift downward, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column to merge.  \n- **Column 1**: [2, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts to [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n- **Column 2**: [2, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts to [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n- **Column 3**: [0, 2, 0, 0] → Shifts to [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n\nAfter swiping DOWN, the grid (before adding a new tile) becomes:  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|2|2|2  \n\nNo merges occur, so no score is gained.  \n\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nSwipping LEFT and RIGHT both merge two 2s into a 4, but LEFT positions the merged 4 and the 2 in Row 1 on the left edge, which is more strategic for future merges (e.g., aligning tiles to combine again in subsequent moves). UP and DOWN do not generate any merges, making them less optimal.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the current game board and strategic goals (keeping larger tiles in corners and setting up future merges).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|2|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### 1. LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: [4,0,0,0] → shifts left to [4,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [2,0,0,0] → shifts left to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,0] → remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- **Row 3**: [0,0,2,0] → shifts left to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n\nResulting grid after LEFT:  \n```\n4|0|0|0  \n2|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n2|0|0|0  \n```  \n- No immediate merges, but the largest tile (4) stays in the top-left corner (a strategic corner). The 2s in Row 1 and Row 3 of Column 0 are aligned vertically, setting up for a potential merge with a future UP move.\n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: [4,0,0,0] → shifts right to [0,0,0,4] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [2,0,0,0] → shifts right to [0,0,0,2] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,0] → remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- **Row 3**: [0,0,2,0] → shifts right to [0,0,0,2] (no merge).  \n\nResulting grid after RIGHT:  \n```\n0|0|0|4  \n0|0|0|2  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|2  \n```  \n- The largest tile (4) moves to the top-right corner, but the 2s are spread across Column 3, with no immediate setup for merges. This is less optimal than keeping 4 in the top-left corner.\n\n#### 3. UP:\n- **Column 0**: [4,2,0,0] → shifts up to [4,2,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,0] → remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,2] → shifts up to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,0] → remains [0,0,0,0].  \n\nResulting grid after UP:  \n```\n4|0|2|0  \n2|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n```  \n- The largest tile (4) stays in the top-left corner, but the 2s are spread across Row 0 (Column 2) and Row 1 (Column 0). No clear setup for future merges.\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: [4,2,0,0] → shifts down to [0,0,4,2] (no merge).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,0] → remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,2] → shifts down to [0,0,0,2] (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,0] → remains [0,0,0,0].  \n\nResulting grid after DOWN:  \n```\n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n4|0|0|0  \n2|0|2|0  \n```  \n- The largest tile (4) moves to Row 2 (not a corner), and the 2s in Row 3 (Columns 0 and 2) are horizontally separated. This is less optimal for maintaining large tiles in corners.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT keeps the largest tile (4) in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and aligns the 2s vertically in Column 0, setting up for a potential merge with a future UP move. This is the most strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|0|0\nRow 1: 2|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|2|0|0\nRow 3: 2|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All tiles are already shifted to the leftmost positions. Swiping left would not move any tiles (no empty spaces to fill, no merges). This is not a valid move.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles would shift to the right edge, but no merges occur. For example:  \n   - Row 0: [4,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,4]  \n   - Row 1: [2,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,2]  \n   - Row 2: [0,2,0,0] → [0,0,0,2]  \n   - Row 3: [2,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,2]  \n   While tiles move, no merging happens, and this does not strategically consolidate larger tiles.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward, and merging is possible in Column 0. Column 0 has [4, 2, 0, 2] (non-zero tiles: 4, 2, 2). Shifting up consolidates these to [4, 2, 2, 0], then merges the two 2s (rows 1 and 2) into a 4. Column 0 becomes [4, 4, 0, 0]. Column 1 has [0, 0, 2, 0], which shifts up to [2, 0, 0, 0]. The resulting board after merging:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 4|2|0|0  \n   Row 1: 4|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   This move merges two 2s into a 4 (score +4) and consolidates larger tiles (4s) in the top-left corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward. Column 0 has [4, 2, 0, 2] (non-zero tiles: 4, 2, 2). Shifting down consolidates these to [0, 4, 2, 2], then merges the two 2s (rows 2 and 3) into a 4. Column 0 becomes [0, 4, 0, 4]. Column 1 has [0, 0, 2, 0], which shifts down to [0, 0, 0, 2]. The resulting board:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 4|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 4|2|0|0  \n   ```  \n   While merging occurs (score +4), larger tiles (4s) are placed in the bottom-left corner, which is less strategic than consolidating in the top-left.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving UP merges tiles, increases the score, and positions larger tiles in the top-left corner, aligning with optimal strategy.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|2|0|0  \nRow 1: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|2|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:  \n- Row 0: [4, 2, 0, 0] → [4, 2, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- Row 1: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n- Row 3: [0, 2, 0, 0] → [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges, minimal tile rearrangement. No score gain.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n- Row 0: [4, 2, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 4, 2] (no merges).  \n- Row 1: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merges).  \n- Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n- Row 3: [0, 2, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges, tiles shifted right. No score gain.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:  \nProcess columns (tiles move upward, merging adjacent duplicates):  \n- **Column 0**: [4 (Row 0), 4 (Row 1), 0, 0] → [4, 4, 0, 0] → merge into 8 (Row 0), leaving [8, 0, 0, 0]. Score +8.  \n- **Column 1**: [2 (Row 0), 0, 0, 2 (Row 3)] → [2, 2, 0, 0] → merge into 4 (Row 0), leaving [4, 0, 0, 0]. Score +4.  \n- Columns 2-3: All zeros, no changes.  \n\n**Result**: Merges 4+4 into 8 and 2+2 into 4 (total score +12). Post-merge grid (before new tile):  \nRow 0: 8|4|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:  \nProcess columns (tiles move downward, merging adjacent duplicates):  \n- **Column 0**: [4 (Row 0), 4 (Row 1), 0, 0] → [0, 0, 4, 4] → merge into 8 (Row 3), leaving [0, 0, 0, 8]. Score +8.  \n- **Column 1**: [2 (Row 0), 0, 0, 2 (Row 3)] → [0, 0, 2, 2] → merge into 4 (Row 3), leaving [0, 0, 0, 4]. Score +4.  \n- Columns 2-3: All zeros, no changes.  \n\n**Result**: Merges 4+4 into 8 and 2+2 into 4 (total score +12). Post-merge grid (before new tile):  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 8|4|0|0  \n\n\n### Strategy Consideration:  \nBoth UP and DOWN yield the same score (12 points). However, keeping larger tiles in a corner (a common strategy) favors UP, as the merged 8 and 4 tiles are placed in the top-left corner (Row 0), which is more strategic for future merges compared to the bottom-left corner (Row 3).  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|4|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 4|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no tiles merge or move (e.g., row 0: `8|4|0|0` remains unchanged; row 3: `4|0|0|0` remains unchanged). This is not a valid move because no tiles actually shift.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right. Row 0 becomes `0|0|8|4`, and row 3 becomes `0|0|0|4`. While tiles move, no adjacent equal tiles are created, limiting future merge potential.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward. Column 0 (values `8, 0, 0, 4`) becomes `8|4|0|0` (row 0: `8`, row 1: `4`). Column 1 (value `4`) stays in row 0. The resulting board has no adjacent equal tiles, so no immediate merge opportunities.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward. Column 0 (values `8, 0, 0, 4`) shifts to `0|0|8|4` (row 2: `8`, row 3: `4`). Column 1 (value `4`) shifts to row 3, making row 3: `4|4|0|0`. This creates two adjacent `4`s in row 3, which can merge into an `8` with a subsequent LEFT move, generating score.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN creates adjacent `4`s in row 3, setting up a merge opportunity in the next move. This is the most strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes:\n\n### **Game Board** (Current State):\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 8|0|4|0  \nRow 3: 4|4|0|0  \n\n\n### **1. Swipe LEFT**  \n- **Row 0 & 1**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left. `8|0|4|0` becomes `8|4|0|0` (no merging, as 8 ≠ 4).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left. `4|4|0|0` merges into `8|0|0|0` (two 4s merge into 8, score +8).  \n\n**Resulting Board (before new tile)**:  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 8|4|0|0  \nRow 3: 8|0|0|0  \n\n**Key Insight**: Two 8s now align vertically in Column 0 (Row 2 and Row 3), setting up a potential merge into 16 with a subsequent UP swipe.  \n\n\n### **2. Swipe RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0 & 1**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right. `8|0|4|0` becomes `0|0|4|8` (no merging).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right. `4|4|0|0` merges into `0|0|0|8` (two 4s merge into 8, score +8).  \n\n**Resulting Board (before new tile)**:  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|4|8  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|8  \n\n**Key Insight**: Two 8s align vertically in Column 3 (Row 2 and Row 3), but merging them would require a DOWN swipe, which is less strategic for corner stacking.  \n\n\n### **3. Swipe UP**  \n- Columns shift up. Tiles move to the top, but no merges occur (e.g., Column 0: `0|0|8|4` → `8|4|0|0`; Column 1: `0|0|0|4` → `4|0|0|0`; Column 2: `0|0|4|0` → `4|0|0|0`; Column 3: all zeros).  \n**Result**: No merges, score +0.  \n\n\n### **4. Swipe DOWN**  \n- Columns shift down. Tiles move to the bottom, but no merges occur (e.g., Column 0: `0|0|8|4` → `0|0|8|4`; Column 1: `0|0|0|4` → `0|0|0|4`; Column 2: `0|0|4|0` → `0|0|0|4`; Column 3: all zeros).  \n**Result**: No merges, score +0.  \n\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield a merge (score +8), but LEFT strategically positions two 8s vertically in Column 0, enabling a future merge into 16 with a UP swipe. This aligns with the goal of keeping larger tiles in a corner and setting up for higher-scoring merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|2\nRow 2: 8|4|0|0\nRow 3: 8|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0 remains empty.  \n   - Row 1 shifts left to `2|0|0|0` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2 (`8|4|0|0`) and Row 3 (`8|0|0|0`) already have tiles as left as possible (no merges).  \n   - No tiles merge; minimal score gain.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0 remains empty.  \n   - Row 1 (`0|0|0|2`) stays the same (no merges).  \n   - Row 2 shifts right to `0|0|8|4` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3 shifts right to `0|0|0|8` (no merges).  \n   - No tiles merge; minimal score gain.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom.  \n   - **Column 0**: Contains `0, 0, 8, 8`. Tiles shift up to `8, 8, 0, 0`, then merge into `16` (row 0, column 0) with a score gain of 16.  \n   - **Column 1**: Contains `0, 0, 4, 0`. Tiles shift up to `4, 0, 0, 0`.  \n   - **Column 3**: Contains `0, 2, 0, 0`. Tiles shift up to `2, 0, 0, 0`.  \n   - After merging, the board becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 16|4|0|2  \n     Rows 1-3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - This move merges two 8s into a 16, securing a significant score gain and placing the largest tile (16) in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom to top.  \n   - **Column 0**: Contains `0, 0, 8, 8`. Tiles shift down to `0, 0, 0, 16` (merging into 16, row 3, column 0) with a score gain of 16.  \n   - **Column 1**: Contains `0, 0, 4, 0`. Tiles shift down to `0, 0, 0, 4`.  \n   - **Column 3**: Contains `0, 2, 0, 0`. Tiles shift down to `0, 0, 0, 2`.  \n   - After merging, the board becomes:  \n     ```\n     Rows 0-2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 16|4|0|2  \n     ```  \n   - This also merges two 8s into a 16 but places the largest tile in the bottom-left corner.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nBoth UP and DOWN merge the 8s into 16, but UP places the 16 in the top-left corner, a common strategic position to build future merges (e.g., aligning smaller tiles like 4 and 2 in the top row for potential subsequent merges). Thus, UP is the better choice.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (e.g., merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners, and maximizing future options).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|4|0|2\nRow 1: 0|8|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **UP**:  \n   Swiping up would not change the board because all non-zero tiles are already in the topmost positions of their columns (e.g., 16 in column 0, 4 in column 1, 2 in column 3, and 8 in column 1 of row 1). No tiles move, so this is an invalid move.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Swiping right shifts tiles to the rightmost positions:  \n   - Row 0: `0|16|4|2` (no merges, as 16, 4, and 2 are distinct).  \n   - Row 1: `0|0|0|8` (8 shifts to the rightmost column).  \n   The largest tile (16) moves to column 1 of row 0, which is not a corner. This is less strategic, as large tiles are better kept in corners.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Swiping down shifts tiles to the bottommost positions:  \n   - Column 0: 16 moves to row 3 (bottom-left corner).  \n   - Column 1: 4 (row 0) and 8 (row 1) shift down to rows 2 and 3, respectively.  \n   - Column 3: 2 moves to row 3.  \n   Resulting board after shifting (before new tile):  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 0|4|0|0  \n   Row 3: 16|8|0|2  \n   ```  \n   The 16 is now in the bottom-left corner (a good corner), but the 8 is adjacent to it. However, no merges occur, and the arrangement may not facilitate future merges as effectively as other options.\n\n4. **LEFT**:  \n   Swiping left shifts tiles to the leftmost positions:  \n   - Row 0: `16|4|2|0` (no merges, as 16, 4, and 2 are distinct).  \n   - Row 1: `8|0|0|0` (8 shifts to the leftmost column).  \n   Resulting board after shifting (before new tile):  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 16|4|2|0  \n   Row 1: 8|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   The largest tile (16) remains in the top-left corner (a strategic corner). The smaller tiles (4, 2, 8) are positioned in a way that could facilitate future merges (e.g., if a new 2 appears in row 0, column 3, a subsequent left swipe could merge it with the existing 2 in row 0, column 2).\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the best move because it keeps the largest tile (16) in the top-left corner, arranges smaller tiles in a way that supports future merges, and maintains strategic positioning for subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game board and strategic goals (e.g., merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|4|2|0\nRow 1: 8|0|0|0\nRow 2: 4|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles in each row shift left. However, all non-zero tiles in rows 0, 1, and 2 are already as far left as possible (no empty spaces to the left of them). No tiles move, and no merges occur. This is not a valid move.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles in each row shift right.  \n   - Row 0: [16,4,2,0] → [0,16,4,2] (tiles shift right into empty spaces).  \n   - Row 1: [8,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,8] (8 shifts right to the end).  \n   - Row 2: [4,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,4] (4 shifts right to the end).  \n   - Row 3: No change.  \n   No merges occur, and the largest tile (16) moves to row 0, column 1 (not a corner), which is suboptimal.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles in each column shift up. All non-zero tiles in columns 0, 1, and 2 are already as high as possible (no empty spaces above them). No tiles move, and no merges occur. This is not a valid move.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles in each column shift down.  \n   - Column 0: [16,8,4,0] → [0,16,8,4] (16 shifts to row 1, 8 to row 2, 4 to row 3).  \n   - Column 1: [4,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,4] (4 shifts down to row 3).  \n   - Column 2: [2,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,2] (2 shifts down to row 3).  \n   - Column 3: No change.  \n   After shifting, row 3 becomes [4,4,2,0]. While no merges occur in this move, the two 4s in row 3, columns 0 and 1 are now adjacent horizontally. This sets up a future merge (e.g., a subsequent LEFT swipe would merge them into 8, earning points). Additionally, the largest tile (16) remains in a column (column 0) closer to the bottom-left corner, aligning with strategic goals.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move, as it positions tiles to enable future merges and keeps larger tiles in a favorable corner-adjacent position.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|0|0|8\nRow 3: 8|8|2|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0\/1**: All zeros; no change.\n- **Row 2**: `[16, 0, 0, 8]` shifts left to `[16, 8, 0, 0]` (no merging, as 16 ≠ 8).\n- **Row 3**: `[8, 8, 2, 0]` shifts left. The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), and the 2 shifts left, resulting in `[16, 2, 0, 0]`.\n\n**Resulting Board After LEFT**:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|8|0|0\nRow 3: 16|2|0|0\n```\n- Larger tiles (16s) cluster in the left column, a strategic corner for future merges.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0\/1**: All zeros; no change.\n- **Row 2**: `[16, 0, 0, 8]` shifts right to `[0, 0, 16, 8]` (no merging).\n- **Row 3**: `[8, 8, 2, 0]` shifts right. The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), and the 2 shifts right, resulting in `[0, 0, 16, 2]`.\n\n**Resulting Board After RIGHT**:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|16|8\nRow 3: 0|0|16|2\n```\n- Larger tiles (16s) cluster in the right column, but less centralized than the left.\n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns shift upward. No merges occur (all tiles are distinct or isolated). The board becomes spread out, with larger tiles (16, 8, 8) scattered across row 0, reducing strategic clustering.\n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns shift downward. No merges occur (tiles remain distinct or isolated). The board remains sparse, with no meaningful progress in clustering or merging.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe is optimal. It merges the two 8s in row 3 into a 16 (scoring 16 points) and clusters larger tiles (16s) in the left column, a strategic corner that facilitates future merges (e.g., merging the two 16s in column 0 with a subsequent UP swipe).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 8|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|8|0|0\nRow 3: 16|2|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All non-zero tiles are already as far left as possible. No tiles shift or merge. This is an invalid move (no empty spaces to move into or adjacent equal tiles).  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles in each row shift right, but no merges occur (e.g., row 1: `8` moves to column 3; row 2: `16` and `8` shift to columns 2 and 3; row 3: `16` and `2` shift to columns 2 and 3). While valid (tiles move), no merging occurs, and this spreads tiles out, making future merges harder.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles in each column shift upward. For column 0 (values `0, 8, 16, 16`), the two `16`s merge into `32` (score +32), and `8` shifts to row 0. Column 1 (values `0, 0, 8, 2`) shifts upward but no merges occur.

For column 0 (values `0, 8, 16, 16`), the two `16`s merge into `32` (score +32), and `8` shifts to row 2. Column 1 (values `0, 0, 8, 2`) shifts downward but no merges occur.

No merging occurs. The board remains unchanged except for a new tile (2 or 4) in an empty cell. No score is gained.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row shifts right. Row 0 becomes `0|0|0|2`, Row 1 becomes `0|0|0|8`, Row 2 becomes `0|0|0|16`, and Row 3 becomes `0|0|32|2`. No merging occurs (tiles are distinct). No score is gained.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed. Column 0 (`[2,8,16,32]`) has distinct values and remains unchanged. Column 1 (`[0,0,0,2]`) shifts the `2` from Row 3 to Row 0, resulting in `[2,0,0,0]` for Column 1.  \n   - After shifting, the board becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 2|2|0|0  \n     Row 1: 8|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 16|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 32|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - This positions two `2`s in Row 0 (adjacent horizontally), setting up a potential merge in the next move (e.g., swiping LEFT afterward would merge them into a `4`). No merging occurs in this move, but it strategically aligns tiles for future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed. Column 0 (`[2,8,16,32]`) is already fully shifted down (no empty spaces below tiles). Column 1 (`[0,0,0,2]`) has the `2` already in the bottom row (Row 3). The board remains unchanged except for a new tile (2 or 4) in an empty cell. No score is gained.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving **UP** is the best choice. It shifts the `2` from Row 3, Column 1 to Row 0, Column 1, creating adjacent `2`s in Row 0. This sets up a future merge opportunity (e.g., swiping LEFT next turn to merge the `2`s into a `4`), which aligns with the goal of combining tiles to maximize scores.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given game board, focusing on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2|2|0|0  \nRow 1: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 16|2|0|0  \nRow 3: 32|0|0|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: The two `2`s merge into `4` (score +4). Result: `4|0|0|0`.  \n- **Row 1**: `8` shifts left (no merge). Result: `8|0|0|0`.  \n- **Row 2**: `16` and `2` are distinct, so they shift left (no merge). Result: `16|2|0|0`.  \n- **Row 3**: `32` shifts left (no merge).

Result: `0|0|0|4`.  \n- **Row 1**: `8` shifts right. Result: `0|0|0|8`.  \n- **Row 2**: `16` and `2` shift right (no merge). Result: `0|0|16|2`.  \n- **Row 3**: `32` shifts right. Result: `0|0|0|32`.  \n\nAfter RIGHT, the board becomes:  \n```\n0|0|0|4  \n0|0|0|8  \n0|0|16|2  \n0|0|0|32  \n```  \nKey outcome: Large tiles (`32, 16, 8, 4`) are scattered on the right edge, with no clear vertical or horizontal sequence for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- **Column 0**: `2, 8, 16, 32` (no zeros, so no movement\/merge).  \n- **Column 1**: `2` (Row 0) and `2` (Row 2) shift up, merge into `4` (score +4).

This sequence is strategically valuable for future merges (e.g., if another `4` appears in Column 0, it can merge with the existing `4`, and so on). Other moves either scatter large tiles or fail to build a useful sequence.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

Swiping LEFT preserves this alignment, keeping larger tiles concentrated in a corner—a critical strategy for future merges. Other directions (RIGHT, UP, DOWN) either spread large tiles or disrupt their alignment, reducing the potential for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, organizing large tiles in a corner).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 16|2|0|16  \nRow 3: 32|4|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1.

This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner for future merges.\n\n\n#### 2. RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [4,0,0,0] → Shifts right to [0,0,0,4] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [8,0,0,0] → Shifts right to [0,0,0,8] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [16,2,0,16] → Shifts right to [0,16,2,16] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [32,4,0,0] → Shifts right to [0,0,32,4] (no merges).  \n\nResult: Tiles spread out to the right, breaking the vertical stack of large tiles in the left column. This is less strategic for future merges.\n\n\n#### 3. UP Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: [4,8,16,32] → No change (no empty spaces).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,2,4] → Shifts up to [2,4,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,0] → No change.  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,16,0] → Shifts up to [16,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n\nResult: Scatters tiles (e.g., 16 moves to row 0, column 3), disrupting the vertical organization of large tiles.\n\n\n#### 4. DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: [4,8,16,32] → No change (no empty spaces).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,2,4] → No change (no empty spaces below 2 and 4).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,0] → No change.  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,16,0] → Shifts down to [0,0,0,16] (no merges).  \n\nResult: 16 moves to the bottom-right corner, but the left column remains organized. However, this does not enhance the vertical stack as effectively as LEFT.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe maintains the vertical stack of large tiles (4, 8, 16, 32) in the leftmost column, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner for future merges.

Additionally, the left column (column 0) now has `[4,4,16,32]`, setting up potential future merges (e.g., merging the two 4s with a subsequent UP swipe).\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - All rows shift right, but no tiles merge. The largest tile (32) remains in row 3, column 1 (not a corner). No strategic positioning gains.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns shift up, but no tiles merge. The largest tile (32) moves to row 2, column 1 (not a corner). Minimal strategic benefit.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns shift down, but no tiles merge. The largest tile (32) remains in row 3, column 1 (not a corner). No strategic advantage.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSwipping LEFT positions the largest tile (32) in the bottom-left corner and aligns smaller tiles (e.g., 4s) in the left column, creating opportunities for future merges.

Poor for immediate points.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles merge.  \n- Result: No score gain. Poor for immediate points.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- Tiles shift upward, and vertical merges are checked column-wise.  \n  - **Column 3**: [4, 16, 16, 2] → The two 16s (rows 1 and 2) merge into 32, adding 32 to the score.  \n  - Other columns: No merges, but tiles shift upward to fill empty spaces.  \n- Resulting grid after UP swipe:  \n  Row 0: [16, 16, 4, 4] (16s and 4s are adjacent, setting up for future left\/right merges)  \n  Row 1: [0, 32, 2, 32]  \n  Row 2: [0, 0, 4, 2]  \n  Row 3: [0, 0, 0, 0] (Empty row for new tiles, minimizing disruption to larger tiles).  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- Tiles shift downward, and vertical merges are checked column-wise.  \n  - **Column 3**: [4, 16, 16, 2] → The two 16s (rows 1 and 2) merge into 32, adding 32 to the score.  \n  - Other columns: No merges, but tiles shift downward.  \n- Resulting grid after DOWN swipe:  \n  Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 0] (Empty row for new tiles)  \n  Row 1: [0, 0, 4, 4]  \n  Row 2: [0, 16, 2, 32]  \n  Row 3: [16, 32, 4, 2] (Larger tiles spread across the bottom row).  \n\n\n### Key Considerations:  \n- Both UP and DOWN yield 32 points from merging 16s in Column 3.  \n- UP leaves row 0 with adjacent 16s and 4s, which can merge with a subsequent LEFT swipe (32 + 8 = 40 points). This sets up stronger future merges.  \n- UP also keeps the largest tile (32) in row 1, column 1, with empty space below (row 3) to avoid disruption from new tiles.  \n\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given 4x4 grid.

Columns are processed top to bottom. No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, and no tiles can move into empty spaces above (e.g., the 2 in Row 1, Column 0 cannot move up past the 64 in Row 0, Column 0). Thus, no merges or movement occur. **UP is invalid**.\n\n2. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward. Columns are processed bottom to top. Tiles move into empty spaces below, but no adjacent tiles in any column are equal (e.g., 64 and 2 in Column 0, 8 and 2 in Column 1). No merges occur, and the board rearranges but gains no score. **DOWN is valid but low-value**.\n\n3. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right. Rows are processed right to left. In Row 1 ([2,2,2,8]), the two rightmost 2s merge into 4 (score +4), and the row becomes [0,2,4,8]. Row 2 ([0,4,0,0]) shifts right to [0,0,0,4]. Other rows remain unchanged. While valid, this spreads smaller tiles to the right, making future merges less strategic.\n\n4. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left. Rows are processed left to right. In Row 1 ([2,2,2,8]), the two leftmost 2s merge into 4 (score +4), and the row becomes [4,2,8,0]. Row 2 ([0,4,0,0]) shifts left to [4,0,0,0]. Row 0 ([64,8,32,4]) remains unchanged (no merges). This keeps the largest tile (64) in the top-left corner and positions smaller tiles (4, 2, 8) to the right, setting up potential future merges (e.g., the 4 in Row 1, Column 0 and the 4 in Row 2, Column 0 could merge if UP is played next).\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the best move, as it merges tiles for immediate score, keeps the largest tile in a corner, and positions smaller tiles to enable future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile positioning. The goal is to maximize score and keep larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64|8|32|4\nRow 1: 4|2|8|0\nRow 2: 4|0|32|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles merge (all tiles in rows are distinct or separated by zeros). No score gain.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right, but similarly, no adjacent equal tiles merge. No score gain.  \n3. **UP**: Tiles shift upward. In **Column 0** (64, 4, 4, 0), the two 4s merge into 8 (score +8). The 64 remains in the top-left corner (a strategic corner). Other columns have no merges.  \n4. **DOWN**: Tiles shift downward. In **Column 0** (64, 4, 4, 0), the two 4s merge into 8 (score +8). However, the 64 (largest tile) moves from the top-left corner (row 0, col 0) to row 2, col 0, losing the corner position.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nKeeping the largest tile (64) in a corner (top-left) is critical for future merges. Swiping UP preserves 64 in the top-left corner, while DOWN moves it away from the corner. Thus, UP is the better strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down, focusing on merging opportunities, tile organization, and keeping larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 8 | 32 | 4  \nRow 1: 8 | 2 | 8 | 0  \nRow 2: 0 | 4 | 32 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1. Swipe Left:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are non-zero and distinct (64, 8, 32, 4). No merges; remains 64|8|32|4.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (8, 2, 8, 0) shift left but no adjacent duplicates. Remains 8|2|8|0.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (0, 4, 32, 0) shift left to 4|32|0|0. No merges.  \n- **Row 3**: All zeros; no change.  \n**Outcome**: No merges, but tiles shift left, maintaining the 64 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for large tiles). Empty spaces remain, allowing future merges.  \n\n\n#### 2. Swipe Right:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are non-zero and distinct (64, 8, 32, 4). No merges; remains 64|8|32|4.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (8, 2, 8, 0) shift right to 0|8|2|8. No merges.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (0, 4, 32, 0) shift right to 0|0|4|32. No merges.  \n- **Row 3**: All zeros; no change.  \n**Outcome**: No merges, and tiles shift right, moving smaller tiles away from the top-left corner (less strategic).  \n\n\n#### 3. Swipe Up:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles (64, 8, 0, 0) shift up; no merges (64 ≠ 8).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (8, 2, 4, 0) shift up; no merges (8 ≠ 2 ≠ 4).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles (32, 8, 32, 0) shift up; no merges (32 ≠ 8 ≠ 32).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles (4, 0, 0, 0) shift up; no merges.  \n**Outcome**: No movement or merges; the board remains unchanged.  \n\n\n#### 4. Swipe Down:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles (64, 8, 0, 0) shift down to 0|0|64|8. No merges.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (8, 2, 4, 0) shift down to 0|8|2|4. No merges.  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles (32, 8, 32, 0) shift down to 0|32|8|32. No merges.  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles (4, 0, 0, 0) shift down to 0|0|0|4. No merges.  \n**Outcome**: The 64 (largest tile) moves from the top-left corner to row 2, disrupting strategic corner placement.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwipe Left is the best move. It maintains the 64 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for large tiles), shifts smaller tiles left (facilitating future merges), and preserves empty spaces for new tiles. Other moves either leave the board unchanged (Up), move large tiles away from corners (Down), or shift tiles less strategically (Right).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board for possible merges and strategic tile placement. The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 64|8|32|4\nRow 1: 8|2|8|0\nRow 2: 4|32|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles merge in any row. The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles merge in any row. The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift upward. In **Column 3** (values: 4, 0, 0, 4), the two 4s shift upward and merge into an 8 (score +8). The merged 8 occupies Row 0, Column 3. Larger tiles like 64 (Row 0, Column 0) remain in the top-left corner, a strategic position.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift downward. In **Column 3** (values: 4, 0, 0, 4), the two 4s shift downward and merge into an 8 (score +8). However, the 64 (originally in Row 0, Column 0) shifts down to Row 1, Column 0, leaving the top-left corner empty. This disrupts the strategic placement of larger tiles.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe UP move merges tiles (scoring 8) while keeping the largest tile (64) in the top-left corner, a favorable position for future merges. The DOWN move also scores 8 but disrupts the corner placement of the 64. Thus, UP is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (e.g., merging tiles, positioning large tiles, and setting up future merges).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\n64|8|32|8\n8|2|8|0\n4|32|0|0\n0|0|0|32\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 1: `64|8|32|8` (no shifts\/merges, all tiles filled).  \n- Row 2: `8|2|8|0` (no shifts\/merges; 0 remains on the right).  \n- Row 3: `4|32|0|0` (no shifts\/merges; 0s stay).  \n- Row 4: `0|0|0|32` → shifts left to `32|0|0|0`.  \n- **Result**: No merges, score = 0. No strategic advantage.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 1: `64|8|32|8` (no shifts\/merges, all tiles filled).  \n- Row 2: `8|2|8|0` → shifts right to `8|2|0|8` (8s in columns 1 and 4, separated by 0).  \n- Row 3: `4|32|0|0` → shifts right to `0|0|4|32` (32 in column 4).  \n- Row 4: `0|0|0|32` (no shifts; 32 stays in column 4).  \n- **Key Observation**: Column 4 now has `8` (row 1), `8` (row 2), `32` (row 3), and `32` (row 4). This creates two vertically adjacent pairs (8s and 32s) that can merge in future moves (e.g., UP for 8s, DOWN for 32s).  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Column 1: `64|8|4|0` (no shifts\/merges; 0 remains at the bottom).  \n- Column 2: `8|2|32|0` (no shifts\/merges; 0 remains at the bottom).  \n- Column 3: `32|8|0|0` (no shifts\/merges; 0s stay).  \n- Column 4: `8|0|0|32` → shifts up to `8|32|0|0` (8 and 32 in rows 1 and 2, no merge).  \n- **Result**: No merges, score = 0. No strategic setup for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Column 1: `64|8|4|0` → shifts down to `0|64|8|4` (no merges).  \n- Column 2: `8|2|32|0` → shifts down to `0|8|2|32` (no merges).  \n- Column 3: `32|8|0|0` → shifts down to `0|0|32|8` (no merges).  \n- Column 4: `8|0|0|32` → shifts down to `0|0|8|32` (no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges, score = 0. No strategic advantage.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving **RIGHT** sets up vertical pairs of 8s (rows 1-2, column 4) and 32s (rows 3-4, column 4), which can be merged in subsequent moves. This aligns with the strategy of creating future merge opportunities.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the potential merges, score gains, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64|8|32|8\nRow 1: 0|8|2|8\nRow 2: 0|0|4|32\nRow 3: 0|8|0|32\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- No merges occur in any row. Tiles shift left but remain unmerged (e.g., Row 1: `0|8|2|8` → `8|2|8|0`; Row 3: `0|8|0|32` → `8|32|0|0`).  \n- Score gain: 0.  \n- Poor: No merges, minimal strategic benefit.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- No merges occur in any row. Tiles shift right but remain unmerged (e.g., Row 0: `64|8|32|8` stays; Row 1: `0|8|2|8` stays).  \n- Score gain: 0.  \n- Poor: No merges, no strategic improvement.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 1** (values: 8,8,0,8): Merges 8 (Row 0) and 8 (Row 1) into 16 (score +16).  \n- **Column 3** (values: 8,8,32,32): Merges 8 (Row 0) and 8 (Row 1) into 16 (score +16), and 32 (Row 2) and 32 (Row 3) into 64 (score +64).  \n- Total score gain: 16 + 16 + 64 = 96.  \n- Resulting board has 64s in top-left (Row 0, Col 0) and bottom-right (Row 2, Col 3) corners.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 1** (values: 8,8,0,8): Merges 8 (Row 1) and 8 (Row 0) into 16 (score +16).  \n- **Column 3** (values: 8,8,32,32): Merges 32 (Row 3) and 32 (Row 2) into 64 (score +64), and 8 (Row 1) and 8 (Row 0) into 16 (score +16).  \n- Total score gain: 16 + 64 + 16 = 96.  \n- Resulting board consolidates 64s in bottom-left (Row 3, Col 0) and bottom-right (Row 3, Col 3) corners, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners. This leaves top rows mostly empty, enhancing future flexibility.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nBoth UP and DOWN yield the same score, but DOWN better positions large tiles (64s) in the bottom corners, a key strategic advantage.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|32|32|0\nRow 2: 0|8|2|16\nRow 3: 64|16|4|64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles `[0,32,32,0]` shift left. The two `32`s merge into `64`, resulting in `[64,0,0,0]` (score +64).  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles `[0,8,2,16]` shift left to `[8,2,16,0]` (no merging).  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles `[64,16,4,64]` have no adjacent equals, so they remain `[64,16,4,64]` (no merging).  \n   - **Result**: Merges the `32`s in Row 1 into `64`, consolidates smaller tiles leftward, and positions the new `64` in Row 1, Column 0—aligning with the existing `64` in Row 3, Column 0 (potential future merge in Column 0).  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles `[0,32,32,0]` shift right. The two `32`s merge into `64`, resulting in `[0,0,0,64]` (score +64).  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles `[0,8,2,16]` shift right to `[0,8,2,16]` (no merging).  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles `[64,16,4,64]` have no adjacent equals, so they remain `[64,16,4,64]` (no merging).  \n   - **Result**: Merges the `32`s in Row 1 into `64`, but positions the new `64` in Row 1, Column 3—less aligned with existing larger tiles (Row 3, Column 0 and 3).  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - **Column 0**: `[0,0,0,64]` shifts up to `[64,0,0,0]` (no merging).  \n   - **Column 1**: `[0,32,8,16]` shifts up to `[32,8,16,0]` (no merging).  \n   - **Column 2**: `[0,32,2,4]` shifts up to `[32,2,4,0]` (no merging).  \n   - **Column 3**: `[0,0,16,64]` shifts up to `[16,64,0,0]` (no merging).  \n   - **Result**: No merging occurs, so no score. Tiles are spread out, with minimal strategic advantage.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles are already positioned at the bottom of their columns (e.g., `64` in Row 3, Column 0 and 3; `32` in Row 1, Column 1 and 2). No tiles move or merge.  \n   - **Result**: Invalid move (no tiles shift or merge).  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nLEFT swipe merges the `32`s in Row 1 into `64` (immediate score +64), consolidates smaller tiles leftward, and aligns the new `64` in Row 1, Column 0 with the existing `64` in Row 3, Column 0—setting up potential future merges in Column 0. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and facilitating future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and the goal of merging tiles for higher scores.

This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles (e.g., 64s) in corners (row1, col0 and row3, col0) and organizing smaller tiles for future merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles [64, 0, 0, 32] shift right to [0, 0, 64, 32] (no merges).  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles [8, 2, 16, 0] shift right to [0, 8, 2, 16] (no merges).  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles [64, 16, 4, 64] shift right (no merges, as adjacent tiles are distinct).  \n   - Result: Zeros accumulate on the left, which is less optimal for merging larger tiles in corners.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles [0, 64, 8, 64] shift up to [64, 8, 64, 0] (no merges).  \n   - **Column 1**: Tiles [0, 0, 2, 16] shift up to [2, 16, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - **Column 2**: Tiles [0, 0, 16, 4] shift up to [16, 4, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - **Column 3**: Tiles [0, 32, 0, 64] shift up to [32, 64, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Result: Larger tiles (e.g., 64s) are spread across rows 0, 1, and 2, reducing corner concentration.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles [0, 64, 8, 64] shift down (no change, as tiles are already as low as possible).  \n   - **Column 1**: Tiles [0, 0, 2, 16] shift down (no change).  \n   - **Column 2**: Tiles [0, 0, 16, 4] shift down (no change).  \n   - **Column 3**: Tiles [0, 32, 0, 64] shift down to [0, 0, 32, 64] (no merges).  \n   - Result: The board remains unchanged except for potential new tile placement, offering no strategic advantage.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving LEFT keeps the board compact, with larger tiles (64s) in the left column (row1, col0 and row3, col0), aligning with the strategy of cornering large tiles. This direction maximizes future merging opportunities.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (e.g., merging tiles, positioning large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 64|32|4|0\nRow 2: 8|2|16|0\nRow 3: 64|16|4|64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row).  \n   - Row 1: `64|32|4|0` (no change, as 0 is already at the end).  \n   - Row 2: `8|2|16|0` (no change).  \n   - Row 3: `64|16|4|64` (no merges).  \n   - Result: No merges, and large tiles (64s) remain scattered.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row).  \n   - Row 1: `0|64|32|4` (non-zeros shift right).  \n   - Row 2: `0|8|2|16` (non-zeros shift right).  \n   - Row 3: `64|16|4|64` (no merges).  \n   - Result: No merges, and large tiles (64s) are spread across rows 1 and 3.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift upward. Let’s analyze columns:  \n     - **Column 0**: `[0,64,8,64]` → shifts to `[64,8,64,0]` (no merges).  \n     - **Column 1**: `[0,32,2,16]` → shifts to `[32,2,16,0]` (no merges).  \n     - **Column 2**: `[0,4,16,4]` → shifts to `[4,16,4,0]` (no merges).  \n     - **Column 3**: `[0,0,0,64]` → shifts to `[64,0,0,0]` (no merges).  \n   - Post-shift board:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 64|32|4|64  \n     Row 1: 8|2|16|0  \n     Row 2: 64|16|4|0  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - Strategic benefit: Large tiles (64s) are positioned in the top-left and top-right corners (row 0, columns 0 and 3), aligning with the goal of keeping large tiles in corners for future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift downward. No merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any column).  \n   - Post-shift board remains nearly unchanged, with 64s still scattered.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving **UP** positions the largest tiles (64s) in the top-left and top-right corners, a strategic advantage for future merges. Other moves do not improve tile positioning as effectively.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

All rows remain mostly unchanged, with minimal empty space redistribution. No immediate or future merges are set up.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur.

Columns remain largely unchanged, with minimal empty space redistribution. No meaningful setup for future merges.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift down. Processing each column:  \n   - Column 0: [64, 8, 64, 0] → Shifts to [0, 64, 8, 64] (no merge).  \n   - Column 1: [32, 2, 16, 8] → No shift (no merge).  \n   - Column 2: [4, 16, 4, 0] → Shifts to [0, 4, 16, 4] (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: [64, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts to [0, 0, 0, 64] (no merge).  \n\n   However, after the down swipe, **Row 2 becomes [8, 16, 16, 0]**. This creates adjacent 16s in Row 2, which can be merged in the next move (e.g., a LEFT swipe would merge them into 32, generating score). This setup is critical for future progress.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN swipe strategically positions two 16s adjacent in Row 2, enabling a merge in the next move.

The row becomes [8, 32, 8, 0].  \n   - Row 3: [64, 8, 4, 64] shifts left to [64, 8, 4, 64] (no merges).  \n   - Result: Consolidates tiles to the left, merges 16s into 32, and keeps larger tiles (64s) in corners (row1 col0, row3 col0, row3 col3).  \n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - Row 0: [0, 32, 0, 16] shifts right to [0, 0, 32, 16] (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [64, 2, 4, 0] shifts right to [0, 64, 2, 4] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [8, 16, 16, 8] has adjacent 16s, which merge into 32 (score +32). The row becomes [0, 8, 32, 8].  \n   - Row 3: [64, 8, 4, 64] shifts right to [64, 8, 4, 64] (no merges).  \n   - Result: Merges 16s into 32 but spreads tiles to the right, with larger tiles (64s) less consolidated in corners.  \n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges. Tiles shift up but remain unmerged.  \n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom to top. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges. Tiles shift down but remain unmerged.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the 16s in Row 2 into 32 (score +32). However, LEFT consolidates tiles to the left, placing larger tiles (32, 64) in corners (e.g., 32 in Row 0 col0, 64 in Row 1 col0), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners. RIGHT spreads tiles and leaves larger tiles less consolidated. UP and DOWN yield no merges and are suboptimal.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic tile arrangement. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 64 | 2 | 4 | 0  \nRow 2: 8 | 32 | 8 | 2  \nRow 3: 64 | 8 | 4 | 64  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No Immediate Merges**: None of the directions result in immediate tile merges. All adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) are distinct, and empty spaces do not align to enable merges in any direction.\n- **Strategic Tile Placement**: Larger tiles (e.g., 64s) should ideally be kept in corners to facilitate future merges. The 64 in row 3, column 3 (bottom-right corner) is already in a corner.\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. The board remains mostly unchanged, with empty spaces in row 0 (columns 2-3) and row 1 (column 3). Larger tiles (e.g., 64s in row 1, column 0 and row 3, column 0) stay in the left column but do not form a corner cluster.\n\n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right, with empty spaces moving to the left. The 64 in row 3, column 3 (bottom-right corner) remains in place, reinforcing a corner cluster. Empty spaces appear in row 0 (columns 0-1) and row 1 (column 0), which could allow future tiles to spawn in non-critical areas, preserving the corner 64.\n\n3. **UP**: Tiles shift up, with empty spaces moving to the bottom rows (row 2 and row 3). This disrupts the existing tile distribution, potentially scattering larger tiles (e.g., 64s) and reducing the effectiveness of corner clustering.\n\n4. **DOWN**: Tiles shift down, with empty spaces moving to the top rows (row 0 and row 1). This also scatters larger tiles and does not reinforce the corner cluster of the 64 in row 3, column 3.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving **RIGHT** best preserves the 64 in the bottom-right corner and positions empty spaces in non-critical areas, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners for future merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile movement, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: [0, 0, 32, 16]\nRow 1: [16, 64, 2, 4]\nRow 2: [8, 32, 8, 2]\nRow 3: [64, 8, 4, 64]\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- All rows are already right-aligned with no empty spaces to the right of non-zero tiles. No tiles move. **Invalid**.\n\n#### **DOWN Move**:\n- All columns are already bottom-aligned with no empty spaces below non-zero tiles. No tiles move. **Invalid**.\n\n#### **LEFT Move**:\n- **Row 0** shifts left: `[0, 0, 32, 16] → [32, 16, 0, 0]` (no merges).\n- Other rows have no empty spaces between tiles and remain unchanged. No merges occur. **Valid but no immediate merges**.\n\n#### **UP Move**:\n- **Column 0** shifts up: `[0, 16, 8, 64] → [16, 8, 64, 0]`.\n- **Column 1** shifts up: `[0, 64, 32, 8] → [64, 32, 8, 0]`.\n- Columns 2 and 3 have no empty spaces above tiles and remain unchanged.\n- After shifting, **Row 2** becomes `[64, 8, 8, 2]`, where two adjacent 8s are positioned. This sets up a potential merge (into 16) in future moves if followed by a LEFT swipe. **Valid and strategically better for future merges**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move as it shifts tiles to create adjacent 8s in Row 2, enabling a future merge. This aligns with the strategy of positioning tiles to facilitate merges and keep larger tiles organized.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. The goal is to maximize score, merge tiles strategically, and position larger tiles in corners for future moves.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|64|32|16  \nRow 1: 8|32|2|4  \nRow 2: 64|8|8|2  \nRow 3: 8|0|4|64  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **UP Swipe**:  \n- Columns are processed top-to-bottom. No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, and no empty spaces force tiles to shift significantly. No merges occur, and the board remains largely unchanged. **No score gain**.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:  \n- Columns are processed bottom-to-top. No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, and empty spaces (only one 0 in row 3, column 1) do not lead to meaningful shifts. No merges occur, and the board remains largely unchanged. **No score gain**.\n\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:  \n- Rows are processed left-to-right.  \n  - Row 0: Tiles (16, 64, 32, 16) are distinct; no merges.  \n  - Row 1: Tiles (8, 32, 2, 4) are distinct; no merges.  \n  - Row 2: Tiles (64, 8, 8, 2) have adjacent 8s. They merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in `64|16|2|0`.  \n  - Row 3: Tiles (8, 0, 4, 64) shift left to `8|4|64|0` (no merges).  \n  - **Score gain: 16**.  \n  - Resulting 0s are in row 2 (column 3) and row 3 (column 3) (right side).\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n- Rows are processed right-to-left.  \n  - Row 0: Tiles (16, 64, 32, 16) are distinct; no merges.  \n  - Row 1: Tiles (8, 32, 2, 4) are distinct; no merges.  \n  - Row 2: Tiles (64, 8, 8, 2) have adjacent 8s. They merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in `0|64|16|2`.  \n  - Row 3: Tiles (8, 0, 4, 64) shift right to `0|8|4|64` (no merges).  \n  - **Score gain: 16**.  \n  - Resulting 0s are in row 2 (column 0) and row 3 (column 0) (left side).  \n\n### Key Considerations:\n- Both LEFT and RIGHT merges the 8s in row 2, yielding 16 points.  \n- **RIGHT Swipe** positions the 64 in row 3, column 3 (bottom-right corner), a strategic corner for large tiles. This corner placement minimizes interference from future tile spawns and facilitates merging smaller tiles toward the corner.  \n- LEFT Swipe leaves the 64 in row 3, column 2 (not a corner), which is less optimal for long-term strategy.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 64 | 32 | 16  \nRow 1: 8 | 32 | 2 | 4  \nRow 2: 2 | 64 | 16 | 2  \nRow 3: 0 | 8 | 4 | 64  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**:  \n- **Row 0**: [16, 64, 32, 16] – All tiles are distinct; no merging.  \n- **Row 1**: [8, 32, 2, 4] – All tiles are distinct; no merging.  \n- **Row 2**: [2, 64, 16, 2] – Tiles are distinct (2s are non-adjacent); no merging.  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 8, 4, 64] – Shifts left to [8, 4, 64, 0]; no merging.  \n**Result**: No merges, but the empty tile moves to (3,3).  \n\n#### **RIGHT**:  \n- **Row 0**: [16, 64, 32, 16] – All tiles are distinct; no merging.  \n- **Row 1**: [8, 32, 2, 4] – All tiles are distinct; no merging.  \n- **Row 2**: [2, 64, 16, 2] – Tiles are distinct (2s are non-adjacent); no merging.  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 8, 4, 64] – Already right-aligned; no change.  \n**Result**: No merges, no meaningful tile movement.  \n\n#### **UP**:  \n- **Column 0**: [16, 8, 2, 0] – Tiles shift up; no merging.  \n- **Column 1**: [64, 32, 64, 8] – 64s are separated by 32; no merging.  \n- **Column 2**: [32, 2, 16, 4] – All tiles are distinct; no merging.  \n- **Column 3**: [16, 4, 2, 64] – All tiles are distinct; no merging.  \n**Result**: No merges, no meaningful tile movement.  \n\n#### **DOWN**:  \n- **Column 0**: [16, 8, 2, 0] – Tiles shift down to [0, 16, 8, 2]; no merging.  \n- **Column 1**: [64, 32, 64, 8] – 64s are separated by 32; no merging.  \n- **Column 2**: [32, 2, 16, 4] – All tiles are distinct; no merging.  \n- **Column 3**: [16, 4, 2, 64] – Already bottom-aligned; no change.  \n**Result**: No merges, but the empty tile moves to (0,0).  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:  \nAll moves are valid (due to the empty tile at (3,0)), but the goal is to position larger tiles (e.g., 64s) to facilitate future merges. Moving **DOWN** shifts smaller tiles (2, 8, 16) in Column 0 downward, creating space in the top row. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles (e.g., 64s in Column 1 and 3) in lower rows, where they are less likely to block future merges.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate potential merges or shifts for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 64 | 32 | 16  \nRow 1: 16 | 32 | 2 | 4  \nRow 2: 8 | 64 | 16 | 2  \nRow 3: 2 | 8 | 4 | 64  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Grid is Full**: All tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces, i.e., no `0`).  \n- **No Adjacent Equal Tiles**: Checking rows and columns, no two adjacent tiles have the same value. For example:  \n  - Rows: All adjacent tiles (e.g., 4 & 64, 64 & 32, etc.) are distinct.  \n  - Columns: All adjacent tiles (e.g., 4 & 16, 64 & 32, etc.) are also distinct.  \n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\nA valid move requires either merging adjacent equal tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are equal:  \n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: No merges are possible, and no tiles can shift (as there are no empty spaces to move into).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves are invalid under the game rules (no merges or empty spaces to shift into).

Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are equal, all moves are technically invalid under the rules. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile all moves are invalid due to the full grid and lack of adjacent equal tiles, the problem specifies choosing one of the directions. Given no strategic advantage, any direction is equally arbitrary. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and the game rules.

Tiles cannot merge or shift left (since no empty spaces exist). No valid merges or shifts occur. **Invalid move.**\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nSimilar to LEFT, all rows are fully occupied with distinct numbers. Tiles cannot merge or shift right (no empty spaces). No valid merges or shifts occur. **Invalid move.**\n\n#### **DOWN**  \nColumns are checked for merging when tiles shift downward. All columns have distinct numbers (no adjacent duplicates). For example:  \n- Column 0: 4, 16, 8, 2 (all distinct)  \n- Column 1: 64, 32, 64, 8 (no adjacent duplicates when shifted down)  \n- Columns 2 and 3: All distinct.  \nNo merges or shifts occur. **Invalid move.**\n\n#### **UP**  \nColumns are checked for merging when tiles shift upward. Column 1 (64, 32, 64, 8) has two 64s separated by a 32. When shifting up:  \n- The top 64 (row 0) and the 64 in row 2 will merge into 128 (since they are the same and can shift upward past the 32 in row 1).  \n- The 8 in row 3 shifts up to row 2, leaving row 3 empty.  \nThis results in a merge (64 + 64 = 128) and creates an empty space. **Valid move with scoring.**  \n\n\nThe only valid move that allows merging and creates an empty space is **UP**.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning.

For example:\n  - Rows: All rows have unique adjacent values (e.g., Row 0: 4, 64, 32, 16; no duplicates).\n  - Columns: All columns also have unique adjacent values (e.g., Column 1: 64, 32, 64, 8; 64s are not adjacent).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT:** Tiles in each row are already packed with no gaps. No merges occur as adjacent tiles are distinct.  \n2. **UP\/DOWN:** Tiles in each column are fully packed with no gaps. No merges occur as adjacent tiles are distinct.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are equal, there are no valid moves that result in merging or shifting tiles.

For example:  \n   - Rows: All tiles in each row (4,64,32,16; 16,32,2,4; 8,64,16,2; 2,8,4,64) are distinct.  \n   - Columns: All tiles in each column (4,16,8,2; 64,32,64,8; 32,2,16,4; 16,4,2,64) are also distinct.  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Since all rows are full (no empty spaces) and no adjacent equal tiles, shifting left or right would not merge any tiles or move existing tiles (they are already compressed to the edges).  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: Similarly, all columns are full (no empty spaces) and no adjacent equal tiles, so shifting up or down would not merge any tiles or move existing tiles (they are already compressed to the top\/bottom edges).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThere are no valid moves because the grid is full, and no adjacent tiles can merge. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid merges or empty spaces, any direction would technically be invalid, but a default choice is required.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merge potential and tile alignment.

Invalid.  \n4. **UP**: Check columns for merges:  \n   - **Column 1** (values: 64, 32, 64, 8): When shifting up, the 64 in Row 2 moves up past the 32 in Row 1, resulting in [64, 64, 32, 8]. The two 64s merge into 128, creating a new tile (128) and leaving an empty space (0) in Row 1. The 32 and 8 then shift up to fill the empty space, resulting in [128, 32, 8, 0].

By the rules, a valid move requires either adjacent same tiles or empty spaces to shift tiles into. Since there are no empty spaces and no adjacent same tiles, **no valid moves exist**. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the strategic goal of aligning larger tiles (e.g., 64s) for future merges, moving **UP** is marginally better for potential future alignment.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid, checking for potential tile merges or valid shifts.

No adjacent tiles in any row are the same, so no merges occur. Tiles cannot shift left (already leftmost), making this move invalid.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**: Similarly, all rows are fully occupied with distinct numbers.

No merges occur.  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: Swiping up or down would not shift any tiles, as all columns are filled with distinct, non-zero values. No merges occur.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, there are no valid moves.

No horizontal merges are possible.  \n3. **Vertical Adjacents**: In all columns, adjacent tiles are distinct (e.g., Column 0: 4, 16, 8, 2; Column 1: 64, 32, 64, 8). The only repeated value (64 in Column 1, Rows 0 and 2) is not adjacent, so vertical merges are also impossible.  \n\n### Move Analysis:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Since all rows are full with distinct tiles, shifting left or right does not change the board (no merges or empty spaces to fill).  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: All columns are full with distinct tiles. Shifting up or down also leaves the board unchanged (no merges or empty spaces to fill).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are invalid because there are no adjacent tiles to merge and no empty spaces to shift into.

All tiles in every row are distinct (4,64,32,16; 16,32,2,4; 8,64,16,2; 2,8,4,64). No adjacent tiles are the same, so no merges occur. Since the grid is full, no tiles can shift into empty spaces. **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Each row is processed right-to-left. All tiles in every row remain distinct when reversed (16,32,64,4; 4,2,32,16; 2,16,64,8; 64,4,8,2).

Shifting up or down also does not cause merges. The grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Valid Moves:\nA valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles or moving into empty spaces. Since the grid is full (no empty spaces) and no adjacent tiles are equal, **no valid moves exist**. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.

However, to align with strategic principles (e.g., keeping larger tiles in a corner), moving **UP** might marginally better position tiles for potential future merges (though no immediate benefit exists).  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid for possible merges or shifts in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into.

The goal is to merge these 2s to gain points and set up for future moves.\n\n### Evaluation of Directions:\n1. **UP**: Swiping up moves tiles upward. The 2s in Row 3, columns 1 and 2 would shift to Row 0, columns 1 and 2. However, these 2s are now in the same row (Row 0) but not in the same column, so they do not merge. No score is gained, and this is less optimal.  \n2. **DOWN**: Swiping down attempts to move tiles downward. Since the 2s are already in the bottom row (Row 3), they cannot move further down. No tiles shift, so this is not a valid move.  \n3. **LEFT**: Swiping left shifts tiles in Row 3 to the left. The 2s in columns 1 and 2 move to columns 0 and 1. Since they are now adjacent and equal, they merge into a 4 (score +4). The merged 4 occupies column 0 of Row 3, leaving the rest of the row empty. This is a valid move that maximizes immediate points.  \n4. **RIGHT**: Swiping right shifts tiles in Row 3 to the right. The 2s in columns 1 and 2 move to columns 2 and 3. They merge into a 4 (score +4), occupying column 3 of Row 3. This is also valid but leaves the merged tile in the bottom-right corner instead of the bottom-left.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe problem emphasizes keeping larger tiles in a corner for future merges. Swiping LEFT places the merged 4 in the bottom-left corner (Row 3, column 0), which is a strategic corner position. This setup is more favorable for future moves, as it allows smaller tiles to be merged toward the corner.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current game board and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic placement of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 2|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 4|0|0|0\n```\nTiles are in column 0: 2 (row 1) and 4 (row 3).

No movement occurs. Not a valid move.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift to the right edge. Row 1 becomes `0|0|0|2`, and row 3 becomes `0|0|0|4`. This is valid (tiles move), but larger tiles (4) end up in the bottom-right corner, leaving less structure for future merges.  \n3. **DOWN**: Tiles shift down. 2 (row 1, column 0) moves to row 2, column 0 (since row 3, column 0 is occupied by 4). The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 2|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 4|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   Valid, but tiles are spread vertically with no immediate merge potential.  \n4. **UP**: Tiles shift up. 2 (row 1, column 0) moves to row 0, column 0; 4 (row 3, column 0) moves to row 1, column 0. The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 2|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 4|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   Valid, and larger tiles (4) are now in the top-left corner (row 1, column 0), aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner. This setup increases the chance of merging smaller tiles (e.g., a new 2 in row 0, column 1 could merge with row 0, column 0's 2 on a subsequent left swipe).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP positions tiles optimally for future merges and follows the strategy of concentrating larger tiles in a corner. \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to maximize future merging potential and follow the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 4|2|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [2,0,0,0] shifts left (no change, as 2 is already leftmost).  \n   - Row 1: [4,2,0,0] shifts left (no change, as 4 and 2 are already leftmost with no zeros between them).  \n   - No merges occur. The board remains nearly unchanged, with no new opportunities for merging in the next move.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [2,0,0,0] shifts right, resulting in [0,0,0,2].  \n   - Row 1: [4,2,0,0] shifts right, resulting in [0,0,4,2].  \n   - No merges occur. The larger tiles (4 and 2) are spread out, reducing future merging potential.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: [2,4,0,0] shifts up (no merges, as 2 and 4 are different).  \n   - Column 1: [0,2,0,0] shifts up, moving the 2 to Row 0, resulting in Row 0: [2,2,0,0].  \n   - No merges during the move, but Row 0 now has two adjacent 2s. This sets up a future merge opportunity (e.g., swiping LEFT next would merge these 2s into a 4, increasing the score).  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: [2,4,0,0] shifts down, resulting in [0,0,2,4].  \n   - Column 1: [0,2,0,0] shifts down, moving the 2 to Row 3, resulting in Row 3: [4,2,0,0].  \n   - No merges occur. The larger tiles (4 and 2) are spread to the bottom, with no adjacent duplicates to merge in the next move.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe UP move positions two 2s adjacently in Row 0, creating a strategic opportunity for merging in the next move. This aligns with the goal of building larger tiles and improving future scoring potential.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2|2|0|0\nRow 1: 4|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|2|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles `[2,2,0,0]` shift left, merging the two 2s into 4 (score +4). Result: `[4,0,0,0]`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `[4,0,0,0]` shift left (no merge). Result: `[4,0,0,0]`.  \n- **Row 2**: All zeros (no change).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `[0,0,2,0]` shift left, moving the 2 to the first position. Result: `[2,0,0,0]`.  \n\nAfter LEFT swipe, the board becomes:  \n```\n4|0|0|0  \n4|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n2|0|0|0  \n```  \nThis merges the 2s in Row 0, scores 4, and consolidates larger tiles (4s) in the left column, which can be merged vertically in subsequent moves (e.g., swiping UP to merge the two 4s in Column 0).\n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles `[2,2,0,0]` shift right, merging the two 2s into 4 (score +4). Result: `[0,0,0,4]`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `[4,0,0,0]` shift right (no merge). Result: `[0,0,0,4]`.  \n- **Row 2**: All zeros (no change).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `[0,0,2,0]` shift right, moving the 2 to the last position. Result: `[0,0,0,2]`.  \n\nAfter RIGHT swipe, the board becomes:  \n```\n0|0|0|4  \n0|0|0|4  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|2  \n```  \nThis also merges the 2s in Row 0 and scores 4, but consolidates larger tiles (4s) in the right column. While viable, the LEFT swipe keeps tiles in the left column, which aligns better with strategic corner consolidation.\n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns shift upward. No merges occur because:  \n  - Column 0: `[2,4,0,0]` (2 and 4 are distinct).  \n  - Column 1: `[2,0,0,0]` (single 2).  \n  - Column 2: `[0,0,0,2]` (single 2).  \n  - Column 3: All zeros.  \n\nResult: No score, and tiles are spread out. Not optimal.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns shift downward. No merges occur because:  \n  - Column 0: `[2,4,0,0]` (2 and 4 are distinct).  \n  - Column 1: `[2,0,0,0]` (single 2).  \n  - Column 2: `[0,0,0,2]` (single 2).  \n  - Column 3: All zeros.  \n\nResult: No score, and tiles are spread out. Not optimal.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the 2s in Row 0 (scoring 4). However, LEFT consolidates larger tiles (4s) in the left column, which is more strategic for future vertical merges (e.g., swiping UP to merge the two 4s in Column 0). This aligns with the goal of keeping larger tiles in a corner.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to see which maximizes scoring and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|0|0\nRow 1: 4|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|2\nRow 3: 2|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Tiles shift left in each row. No merges occur (all rows have a single non-zero tile with no adjacent duplicates). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right in each row. No merges occur (all rows have a single non-zero tile with no adjacent duplicates). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n3. **UP**: Tiles shift upward in each column.  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles are [4, 4, 0, 2]. Non-zero tiles [4, 4, 2] shift up. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), leaving [8, 2, 0, 0] in the column.  \n   - **Column 3**: Tiles are [0, 0, 2, 0]. The 2 shifts up to row 0, resulting in [2, 0, 0, 0] in the column.  \n   - Other columns (1, 2) remain empty.  \n   After UP, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 8|0|0|2  \n   Row 1: 2|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   The 8 (merged from 4s) is placed in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**: Tiles shift downward in each column.  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles are [4, 4, 0, 2]. Non-zero tiles [4, 4, 2] shift down. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), leaving [0, 0, 8, 2] in the column.  \n   - **Column 3**: Tiles are [0, 0, 2, 0]. The 2 shifts down to row 3, resulting in [0, 0, 0, 2] in the column.  \n   - Other columns (1, 2) remain empty.  \n   After DOWN, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 8|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 2|0|0|2  \n   ```  \n   The 8 is placed in row 2, column 0 (not a corner), which is less strategic than the top-left corner.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nUP and DOWN both merge the two 4s for a score of 8, but UP places the merged 8 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for future merges), making it the better move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to identify a move that sets up future merges and maintains strategic tile placement.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 0 | 0 | 2  \nRow 1: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 4 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift left in each row.  \n  - Row 0: [8, 0, 0, 2] → [8, 2, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n  - Row 1: [2, 0, 0, 0] → [2, 0, 0, 0] (no change).  \n  - Row 3: [0, 0, 4, 0] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n- Result: No merges. Tiles are spread across the left with no obvious future merge opportunities.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift right in each row.  \n  - Row 0: [8, 0, 0, 2] → [0, 0, 8, 2] (no merge).  \n  - Row 1: [2, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merge).  \n  - Row 3: [0, 0, 4, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merge).  \n- Result: No merges, but key tiles are now positioned on the right:  \n  - 8 (0,2), 2 (0,3), 2 (1,3), 4 (3,3).  \n- Strategic Value: The two 2s in column 3 (rows 0 and 1) are vertically adjacent. A subsequent DOWN swipe would merge them into a 4, creating a score opportunity.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift up in each column.  \n  - Column 0: [8, 2, 0, 0] → [8, 2, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n  - Column 2: [0, 0, 0, 4] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n  - Column 3: [2, 0, 0, 0] → [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n- Result: No merges. Tiles are spread across the top with no clear future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift down in each column.  \n  - Column 0: [8, 2, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 8, 2] (no merge).  \n  - Column 3: [2, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merge).  \n- Result: No merges. Tiles are spread across the bottom with minimal potential for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe RIGHT swipe positions two 2s vertically adjacent in column 3, creating a future merge opportunity (e.g., a subsequent DOWN swipe would merge them into a 4). This strategic setup makes RIGHT the best move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize merges and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2|0|8|2\nRow 1: 0|0|0|2\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n   - Result: No score gain, and tiles are scattered with no strategic advantage.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n   - Result: No score gain, and tiles remain scattered.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed top-to-bottom. For column 3 (values: 2, 2, 0, 4), tiles shift up to [2, 2, 4, 0]. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in [4, 0, 4, 0]. After shifting up again, the column becomes [4, 4, 0, 0].  \n   - Result: Score +4, but larger tiles (8, 4, 4) end up in the top rows, which is suboptimal for corner-based strategy.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom-to-top. For column 3 (values: 2, 2, 0, 4), tiles shift down to [0, 2, 2, 4]. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in [0, 0, 4, 4].  \n   - Result: Score +4, and larger tiles (8, 4, 4, 2) are positioned in the bottom rows (row 3 and row 2), aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (bottom right).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN swipe merges tiles for a score gain and positions larger tiles in the bottom rows, which is more strategic for future moves.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the game rules and strategic considerations.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|2|0|4  \nRow 3: 2|0|8|4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0 and Row 1 remain unchanged (all zeros).  \n- Row 2: [0,2,0,4] → shifts left to [2,4,0,0] (no merges).  \n- Row 3: [2,0,8,4] → shifts left to [2,8,4,0] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges, score 0.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0 and Row 1 remain unchanged (all zeros).  \n- Row 2: [0,2,0,4] → shifts right to [0,0,2,4] (no merges).  \n- Row 3: [2,0,8,4] → shifts right to [0,2,8,4] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges, score 0.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed from top to bottom, shifting tiles upward and merging adjacent equal values.  \n  - Column 0: [0,0,0,2] → shifts up to [2,0,0,0].  \n  - Column 1: [0,0,2,0] → shifts up to [2,0,0,0].  \n  - Column 2: [0,0,0,8] → shifts up to [8,0,0,0].  \n  - Column 3: [0,0,4,4] → shifts up to [4,4,0,0], then merges into [8,0,0,0] (score +8).  \n- **Result**: Merged 4s in Column 3, score 8. New board:  \n  Row 0: 2|2|8|8  \n  Rows 1-3: 0s.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed from bottom to top, shifting tiles downward and merging adjacent equal values.  \n  - Column 0: [0,0,0,2] → shifts down to [0,0,0,2] (no change).  \n  - Column 1: [0,0,2,0] → shifts down to [0,0,0,2].  \n  - Column 2: [0,0,0,8] → shifts down to [0,0,0,8] (no change).  \n  - Column 3: [0,0,4,4] → shifts down to [0,0,4,4], then merges into [0,0,0,8] (score +8).  \n- **Result**: Merged 4s in Column 3, score 8. New board:  \n  Row 3: 2|2|8|8  \n  Rows 0-2: 0s.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration  \nThe goal is to keep larger tiles in a corner. The largest tile (8) in the original board is in Row 3, Column 2. Swiping DOWN keeps the 8 in the bottom row (Row 3), a strategic corner. Swiping UP moves the 8 to the top row, which is less optimal for building toward a corner. Thus, DOWN is better for long-term strategy.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|4\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 2|2|8|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,0,4] shifts left → [4,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: [2,2,8,8] shifts left:  \n  - 2 and 2 merge into 4 (score +4), 8 and 8 merge into 16 (score +16).  \n  - Result: [4,16,0,0].  \n- **Final Board After LEFT**:  \n  Row 0: 4|0|0|0  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 4|16|0|0  \n- **Score Gain**: 20 (4 + 16).  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,0,4] shifts right → [0,0,0,4] (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: [2,2,8,8] shifts right:  \n  - 2 and 2 merge into 4 (score +4), 8 and 8 merge into 16 (score +16).  \n  - Result: [0,0,4,16].  \n- **Final Board After RIGHT**:  \n  Row 0: 0|0|0|4  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 0|0|4|16  \n- **Score Gain**: 20 (4 + 16).  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns shift upward, but no merges occur (tiles are isolated vertically).  \n- **Final Board After UP**:  \n  Row 0: 2|2|8|4  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|8  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n- **Score Gain**: 0.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns shift downward, but no merges occur (tiles are isolated vertically).  \n- **Final Board After DOWN**:  \n  Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|4  \n  Row 3: 2|2|8|8  \n- **Score Gain**: 0.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:  \nBoth LEFT and RIGHT yield 20 points, but RIGHT is preferable strategically. After RIGHT, the merged 16 tile is placed in the bottom-right corner (a common corner strategy for stability), and the 4 in row 0, column 3 remains in the top-right corner, aligning larger tiles along the right edge. This configuration minimizes disruption to larger tiles and supports future merging opportunities.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to position tiles for future merges and maximize score potential.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 1: 0|4|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|4|16  \n```\nKey tiles: 4 at (0,3), 4 at (1,1), 4 at (3,2), and 16 at (3,3). No immediate merges are possible, so we focus on positioning tiles to enable future merges.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,0,0,4] → shifts to [4,0,0,0].  \n   - Row 1: [0,4,0,0] → shifts to [4,0,0,0].  \n   - Row 3: [0,0,4,16] → shifts to [4,16,0,0].  \n   - Result: Tiles are spread left but not adjacent for merges. No immediate score gain.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,0,0,4] → remains [0,0,0,4].  \n   - Row 1: [0,4,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,4].  \n   - Row 3: [0,0,4,16] → remains [0,0,4,16].  \n   - Result: Tiles are spread right but not adjacent for merges. No immediate score gain.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 1 (contains 4 at (1,1)) shifts up to [4,0,0,0].  \n   - Column 2 (contains 4 at (3,2)) shifts up to [4,0,0,0].  \n   - Column 3 (contains 4 at (0,3) and 16 at (3,3)) shifts up to [4,16,0,0].  \n   - Result: Tiles are spread vertically but not adjacent for merges. No immediate score gain.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 1 (contains 4 at (1,1)) shifts down to [0,0,0,4].  \n   - Column 2 (contains 4 at (3,2)) remains at [0,0,0,4].  \n   - Column 3 (contains 4 at (0,3) and 16 at (3,3)) shifts down to [0,0,4,16].  \n   - Result: After shifting, row 3 becomes [0,4,4,16]. The two 4s in row 3 (columns 1 and 2) are now adjacent horizontally, setting up a potential merge with a subsequent LEFT swipe. This positions tiles for future score gains.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping DOWN aligns two 4s in row 3, creating a strategic opportunity for a merge in the next move. This is the best choice to maximize future scoring potential.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their effects on the game board:\n\n### Game Board (Current State):\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 3: 0|4|4|16  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: All zeros → no change.  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,2] → shifts left to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,4] → shifts left to [4,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,4,4,16] → 4 and 4 merge into 8, then 16 shifts left. Result: [8,16,0,0].  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 4+4=8 (score +8), but moves 16 from the bottom-right corner (column 3) to column 1, losing the corner position.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: All zeros → no change.  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,2] → already right-aligned (no movement).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,4] → already right-aligned (no movement).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,4,4,16] → 4 and 4 merge into 8 (right-aligned), 16 stays in column 3. Result: [0,0,8,16].  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 4+4=8 (score +8), keeps 16 in the bottom-right corner (column 3), which is strategic for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: All zeros → no change.  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,4] → 4 shifts up to row 0 → [4,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,4] → 4 shifts up to row 0 → [4,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 3**: [0,2,4,16] → 2 shifts to row 0, 4 to row 1, 16 to row 2 → [2,4,16,0].  \n- **Resulting Board**:  \n  Row 0: 0|4|4|2  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|4  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|16  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n- **Outcome**: No merges during the move (only shifts), and 16 moves from row 3 to row 2 (losing the bottommost position).  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- All tiles are already as far down as possible (no movement or merges).  \n- **Outcome**: Invalid move.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nSwiping **RIGHT** merges the 4s in row 3 (scoring 8) and keeps the 16 tile in the bottom-right corner, a strategic position for future merges. This is better than LEFT (moves 16 away from the corner) or UP (no merges, 16 moves up). DOWN is invalid.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 3: 0|4|8|16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### 1. RIGHT:\n- Tiles in all rows are already shifted right (e.g., row 1: `0|0|0|2`; row 2: `0|0|0|4`; row 3: `0|4|8|16`). No tiles can move further right.  \n- **Result**: No movement or merging. Not a valid move.\n\n#### 2. DOWN:\n- Columns are checked for downward movement. Columns 1 (`0|0|0|4`), 2 (`0|0|0|8`), and 3 (`0|2|4|16`) have tiles already at the bottom (e.g., 4 in row 3, column 1; 8 in row 3, column 2; 16 in row 3, column 3). No tiles can move down.  \n- **Result**: No movement or merging. Not a valid move.\n\n#### 3. UP:\n- Columns are checked for upward movement:  \n  - Column 1 (`0|0|0|4`) → 4 shifts to row 0.  \n  - Column 2 (`0|0|0|8`) → 8 shifts to row 0.  \n  - Column 3 (`0|2|4|16`) → 2, 4, 16 shift to rows 0, 1, 2 (no merging).  \n- **Result**: Tiles shift up, but no merging occurs. The 16 (originally in the corner at row 3, column 3) moves to row 2, column 3 (not a corner), which is suboptimal.\n\n#### 4. LEFT:\n- Rows are checked for leftward movement:  \n  - Row 1 (`0|0|0|2`) → 2 shifts to row 1, column 0.  \n  - Row 2 (`0|0|0|4`) → 4 shifts to row 2, column 0.  \n  - Row 3 (`0|4|8|16`) → 4, 8, 16 shift to columns 0, 1, 2 (no merging).  \n- **Result**: Tiles shift left, no merging, but the 16 remains in the bottom row (row 3, column 2), adjacent to the corner (row 3, column 3). This setup preserves the large tile in a strategic row and creates potential for future merges (e.g., 4s in row 2, column 0 and row 3, column 0 could merge with an upward swipe later).\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the best move as it shifts tiles meaningfully, keeps the largest tile (16) in the bottom row, and sets up for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|2\nRow 1: 2|0|0|0\nRow 2: 4|0|0|0\nRow 3: 4|8|16|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row).  \n   - Result: Tiles shift left, but no score gained. Not optimal.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - All tiles shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row).  \n   - Result: Tiles shift right, but no score gained. Not optimal.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed vertically (tiles shift upward).  \n   - **Column 0**: [0, 2, 4, 4] → Non-zero tiles [2, 4, 4]. Merging the two 4s (row 2 and 3) into 8 (score +8). Final column: [2, 8, 0, 0].  \n   - **Columns 1-3**: No merges (only single non-zero tiles).  \n   - Result: Merges 4s into 8 (score +8), but larger tiles (16, 8, 2) are spread across the top rows with no immediate follow-up merges.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed vertically (tiles shift downward).  \n   - **Column 0**: [0, 2, 4, 4] → Non-zero tiles [2, 4, 4]. Merging the two 4s (row 2 and 3) into 8 (score +8). Final column: [0, 0, 2, 8].  \n   - **Column 1**: [0, 0, 0, 8] → Tiles shift down (no merge). Final column: [0, 0, 0, 8].  \n   - **Column 2**: [0, 0, 0, 16] → Tiles shift down (no merge). Final column: [0, 0, 0, 16].  \n   - **Column 3**: [2, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift down. Final column: [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n   - Result: Merges 4s into 8 (score +8), and the bottom row (Row 3) becomes `8|8|16|2`. This sets up a **future merge opportunity** (the two 8s in Row 3 can merge with a subsequent LEFT swipe, creating a 16).\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is optimal because it merges the 4s (gaining 8 points) and positions two 8s adjacently in the bottom row, enabling a follow-up merge (e.g., LEFT in the next move) for higher scores.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given 4x4 grid.

The 16s are adjacent in the bottom row, and larger tiles are consolidated in the bottom row (a strategic corner). This setup allows future right swipes to merge the 16s into 32, building toward higher tiles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN move consolidates larger tiles (16s) in the bottom row, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.

This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving DOWN preserves the 16 (bottom-left corner) and 32 (bottom row) tiles, maintaining a strategic position for future merges. It also merges the two 8s for a score gain.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 2: 0|0|8|16  \nRow 3: 16|8|32|2  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: All zeros, no change.  \n- Row 1: [0,0,0,16] → shifts left to [16,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- Row 2: [0,0,8,16] → shifts left to [8,16,0,0] (no merge).  \n- Row 3: [16,8,32,2] → no empty spaces to shift left (already compact), so no change.  \n- **Result**: No merges, minimal tile movement. Not ideal.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: All zeros, no change.  \n- Row 1: [0,0,0,16] → already right-aligned, no change.  \n- Row 2: [0,0,8,16] → already right-aligned, no change.  \n- Row 3: [16,8,32,2] → already right-aligned, no change.  \n- **Result**: No tiles move or merge. Invalid move.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [0,0,0,16] → shifts up to [16,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,8] → shifts up to [8,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,8,32] → shifts up to [8,32,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,16,16,2] → shifts up to [16,16,2,0], then merges the two 16s into 32 (score +32), resulting in [32,2,0,0].  \n- **Result**: Merges two 16s into 32 (score +32), consolidates tiles upward, and positions larger tiles (16, 8, 8, 32) in the top row, creating opportunities for future merges (e.g., 8s in the top row can merge with a subsequent LEFT swipe).  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [0,0,0,16] → already down-aligned, no change.  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,8] → already down-aligned, no change.  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,8,32] → already down-aligned, no change.  \n- **Column 3**: [0,16,16,2] → shifts down to [0,16,16,2], then merges the two 16s into 32 (score +32), resulting in [0,0,32,2].  \n- **Result**: Merges two 16s into 32 (score +32), but tiles remain in lower rows, offering fewer opportunities for future merges compared to UP.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP is the best move. It merges two 16s into 32 (scoring 32), consolidates tiles upward, and positions smaller tiles (8s) adjacently in the top row, setting up for future merges. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (top-right corner here) and creating merge opportunities.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate their impact on tile merging and strategic positioning.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board (rows 0-3):\n- Row 0: 16|8|8|32  \n- Row 1: 0|0|32|2  \n- Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n- Row 3: 0|0|0|8  \n\n\n### 1. Swipe LEFT:\nTiles shift left, merging adjacent equal values:\n- **Row 0**: 16, 8, 8, 32 → 8 and 8 merge into 16. Result: 16|16|32|0 (score +16).  \n- **Row 1**: 0, 0, 32, 2 → 32 and 2 shift left. Result: 32|2|0|0.  \n- **Row 2**: All zeros remain 0|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 3**: 0, 0, 0, 8 → 8 shifts left. Result: 8|0|0|0.  \n\nAfter LEFT, larger tiles (16, 16, 32, 32) are positioned in the left columns, aligning with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner. The merged 16s in Row 0 (columns 0-1) can potentially merge again in a subsequent LEFT swipe, creating a 32.  \n\n\n### 2. Swipe RIGHT:\nTiles shift right, merging adjacent equal values:\n- **Row 0**: 16, 8, 8, 32 → 8 and 8 merge into 16. Result: 0|16|16|32 (score +16).  \n- **Row 1**: 0, 0, 32, 2 → 32 and 2 remain in place. Result: 0|0|32|2.  \n- **Row 2**: All zeros remain 0|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 3**: 0, 0, 0, 8 → 8 remains in place. Result: 0|0|0|8.  \n\nWhile RIGHT also merges the 8s, the resulting tile positions (16s in Row 0 columns 1-2, 32 in Row 0 column 3) are less centralized. The 32 in Row 1 column 2 is isolated, reducing opportunities for future merges compared to LEFT.  \n\n\n### 3. Swipe UP:\nTiles shift up. No merges occur because no adjacent equal values exist in columns:\n- **Column 0**: 16 (Row 0) shifts up; others remain 0. Result: 16|0|0|0.  \n- **Column 1**: 8 (Row 0) shifts up; others remain 0. Result: 8|0|0|0.  \n- **Column 2**: 8 (Row 0) and 32 (Row 1) shift up but do not merge. Result: 8|32|0|0.  \n- **Column 3**: 32 (Row 0), 2 (Row 1), 8 (Row 3) shift up but do not merge. Result: 32|2|8|0.  \n\nUP does not create merges, making it less optimal.  \n\n\n### 4. Swipe DOWN:\nTiles shift down. No merges occur because no adjacent equal values exist in columns:\n- **Column 0**: 16 (Row 0) shifts down to Row 3. Result: 0|0|0|16.  \n- **Column 1**: 8 (Row 0) shifts down to Row 3. Result: 0|0|0|8.  \n- **Column 2**: 8 (Row 0) and 32 (Row 1) shift down. Result: 0|0|8|32.  \n- **Column 3**: 32 (Row 0), 2 (Row 1), 8 (Row 3) shift down. Result: 0|32|2|8.  \n\nDOWN also does not create merges, making it less optimal.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the best move. It merges the 8s in Row 0, gains 16 points, and positions larger tiles (16s, 32s) in the left columns, enabling future merges (e.g., 16s in Row 0 can merge again with another LEFT swipe).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|16|32|0  \nRow 1: 32|2|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|8|0  \nRow 3: 8|0|0|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles move upward. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges occur. Score: 0.  \n\n2. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles move downward. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges occur. Score: 0.  \n\n3. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles move right. For Row 0: 16,16,32,0 → 0,16,16,32 → 0,0,32,32 → 0,0,0,64 (merges 16+16=32, 32+32=64, score +96). Other rows have no merges.

For Row 0: 16,16,32,0 → 32,32,0,0 → 64,0,0,0 (merges 16+16=32, 32+32=64, score +96). Other rows: Row 1 (32,2,0,0) stays, Row 2 (0,0,8,0) → 8,0,0,0, Row 3 (8,0,0,0) stays.

Both LEFT and RIGHT yield 96 score, but LEFT positions the largest tile (64) in the top-left corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN.

Result: [64, 0, 0, 0]. Score +64.\n- **Row 1**: [32, 2, 0, 0] → Tiles shift left (no merge). Result: [32, 2, 0, 0].\n- **Row 2**: [8, 0, 0, 8] → 8 and 8 merge into 16. Result: [16, 0, 0, 0]. Score +16.\n- **Row 3**: [8, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift left (no merge). Result: [8, 0, 0, 0].\n- **Outcome**: Larger tiles (64, 32, 16, 8) stack vertically in the leftmost column, creating a strategic corner for future merges. New tiles will fill empty spaces, minimizing disruption to the stack.\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: [32, 32, 0, 0] → 32 and 32 merge into 64 (right-aligned). Result: [0, 0, 0, 64].

Score +16.\n- **Row 3**: [8, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right (no merge). Result: [0, 0, 0, 8].\n- **Outcome**: Larger tiles stack vertically in the rightmost column, but the 32 and 2 in Row 1 (columns 2-3) may block future merges.\n\n#### **UP Move**:\n- **Column 0**: [32, 32, 8, 8] → 32+32=64 (top) and 8+8=16 (below). Result: [64, 16, 0, 0]. Score +64 +16.\n- **Column 1**: [0, 2, 0, 0] → 2 shifts up. Result: [2, 0, 0, 0].\n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 8, 0] → 8 shifts up. Result: [8, 0, 0, 0].\n- **Outcome**: 64 (top-left), 16 (Row 1, Column 0), 2 (Row 0, Column 1), and 8 (Row 0, Column 3) scatter smaller tiles in the top row, reducing merge efficiency.\n\n#### **DOWN Move**:\n- **Column 0**: [32, 32, 8, 8] → 8+8=16 (bottom) and 32+32=64 (above).

Result: [0, 0, 0, 8].\n- **Outcome**: 64 (Row 2, Column 0), 16 (Row 3, Column 0), 2 (Row 3, Column 1), and 8 (Row 3, Column 3) leave larger tiles spread out, limiting merge potential.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT move strategically stacks larger tiles (64, 32, 16, 8) in the leftmost column, creating a vertical sequence ideal for future merges. This alignment minimizes disruption from new tiles and maximizes the potential to combine adjacent tiles in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential, tile positioning, and strategic goals (e.g., keeping larger tiles in a corner).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64|0|0|0\nRow 1: 32|2|0|0\nRow 2: 16|0|0|32\nRow 3: 8|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: [64,0,0,0] → Shifts left to [64,0,0,0] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [32,2,0,0] → Shifts left to [32,2,0,0] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [16,0,0,32] → Shifts left to [16,32,0,0] (no merges, 16 and 32 are different).\n- **Row 3**: [8,0,0,0] → Shifts left to [8,0,0,0] (no merges).\n\nAfter LEFT, tiles shift to the left edge, keeping larger tiles (64, 32, 16, 8) aligned in the left column (top-left corner). This positions them for potential future merges if adjacent tiles of the same value appear. Empty spaces remain on the right, minimizing disruption to larger tiles.\n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: [64,0,0,0] → Shifts right to [0,0,0,64] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [32,2,0,0] → Shifts right to [0,0,32,2] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [16,0,0,32] → Shifts right to [0,0,16,32] (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: [8,0,0,0] → Shifts right to [0,0,0,8] (no merges).\n\nRIGHT scatters larger tiles (64, 32, 16, 8) to the right edge, making them less aligned for future merges. This is less strategic than keeping them in a corner.\n\n#### 3. UP:\n- **Column 0**: [64,32,16,8] → No shifts (all non-zero, no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [0,2,0,0] → Shifts up to [2,0,0,0] (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,0] → No change.\n- **Column 3**: [0,0,32,0] → Shifts up to [32,0,0,0] (no merges).\n\nUP moves smaller tiles (2, 32) to the top row, disrupting the alignment of larger tiles (64, 32, 16, 8) in the left column. This reduces their potential for future merges.\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: [64,32,16,8] → No shifts (all non-zero, no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [0,2,0,0] → Shifts down to [0,0,0,2] (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,0] → No change.\n- **Column 3**: [0,0,32,0] → Shifts down to [0,0,0,32] (no merges).\n\nDOWN moves smaller tiles (2, 32) to the bottom row, leaving larger tiles (64, 32, 16, 8) in the left column but scattered vertically. This is less optimal than LEFT for maintaining a corner focus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the best move. It keeps larger tiles (64, 32, 16, 8) aligned in the top-left corner, positions them for potential future merges, and minimizes disruption by confining empty spaces to the right.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities while keeping larger tiles consolidated.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 64|0|0|0\nRow 1: 32|2|4|0\nRow 2: 16|32|0|0\nRow 3: 8|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left in each row, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). The board remains largely unchanged, with no score gain. No strategic advantage.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right in each row, but again, no merges occur (adjacent tiles are distinct). The board shifts tiles to the right, but this does not consolidate larger tiles or set up future merges.  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down in each column. Columns 0 (64,32,16,8) remain unchanged (no zeros to shift into). Other columns (1, 2, 3) shift tiles to the bottom but do not create merges. No score gain, and larger tiles (64,32,16,8) are spread vertically, which is less strategic.  \n\n4. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift up in each column. Key observations:  \n     - Column 0 (64,32,16,8) remains unchanged (no zeros to shift into).  \n     - Column 1 (0,2,32,0) shifts 2 to row 0 and 32 to row 1.  \n     - Column 2 (0,4,0,0) shifts 4 to row 0.  \n     - Column 3 (0,0,0,2) shifts 2 to row 0.  \n   - Resulting board after UP:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 64|2|4|2  \n     Row 1: 32|32|0|0  \n     Row 2: 16|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 8|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - This sets up a critical future merge: the two 32s in Row 1 (columns 0 and 1) are now adjacent horizontally. A subsequent LEFT swipe would merge them into 64, yielding a score of 64. This aligns with the strategy of consolidating larger tiles and creating merge opportunities.  \n\n\nUP is the best move as it consolidates tiles, positions larger numbers (64,32,16,8) in Column 0 (a corner), and sets up a future merge of 32s. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize merges and position larger tiles strategically (preferably in a corner).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 2 | 4 | 0  \nRow 1: 32 | 32 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 8 | 2 | 0 | 0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles `64, 2, 4, 0` shift left but do not merge (no adjacent duplicates). Result: `64 | 2 | 4 | 0`.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles `32, 32, 0, 0` shift left and merge into `64` (since two 32s are adjacent). Result: `64 | 0 | 0 | 0` (score +64).  \n   - Row 2: Tiles `16, 0, 0, 0` shift left. Result: `16 | 0 | 0 | 0`.  \n   - Row 3: Tiles `8, 2, 0, 0` shift left. Result: `8 | 2 | 0 | 0`.  \n\n   After a LEFT swipe, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 64 | 2 | 4 | 0  \n   Row 1: 64 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 2: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 3: 8 | 2 | 0 | 0  \n   ```  \n   This consolidates the merged 64 in Row 1, Column 0, aligning it vertically with the existing 64 in Row 0, Column 0. This setup allows potential future merges (e.g., swiping up to merge the two 64s). Larger tiles (64, 64, 16, 8) are concentrated on the left, following a corner strategy.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles `64, 2, 4, 0` shift right. Result: `0 | 64 | 2 | 4` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: Tiles `32, 32, 0, 0` shift right and merge into `64`. Result: `0 | 0 | 0 | 64` (score +64).  \n   - Row 2: Tiles `16, 0, 0, 0` shift right. Result: `0 | 0 | 0 | 16`.  \n   - Row 3: Tiles `8, 2, 0, 0` shift right. Result: `0 | 0 | 8 | 2`.  \n\n   After a RIGHT swipe, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0 | 64 | 2 | 4  \n   Row 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 64  \n   Row 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 16  \n   Row 3: 0 | 0 | 8 | 2  \n   ```  \n   The merged 64 in Row 1, Column 3 is isolated from the existing 64 in Row 0, Column 1. Larger tiles are spread across the right side, making future merges less efficient.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom. No adjacent duplicates exist in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles shift upward but remain unmerged. This move does not improve the board structure.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom to top. No adjacent duplicates exist in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles shift downward but remain unmerged. This move also does not improve the board structure.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe is optimal because it merges the two 32s in Row 1, consolidates larger tiles (64, 64, 16, 8) on the left, and sets up potential future merges (e.g., merging the two 64s vertically with a subsequent UP swipe).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize score and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64|2|4|0\nRow 1: 64|8|0|0\nRow 2: 16|0|0|0\nRow 3: 8|2|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Swiping left shifts tiles to the left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row). The board remains nearly unchanged, with no score gained.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Swiping right shifts tiles to the right, but again, no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row). The board shifts tiles to the rightmost positions, but no score is gained.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Swiping up shifts tiles upward, merging where possible. Key changes occur in **Column 0** (vertical):  \n   - Column 0: `[64 (row0), 64 (row1), 16 (row2), 8 (row3)]`. The two 64s (row0 and row1) merge into 128 (score +128). The 16 (row2) and 8 (row3) shift up to row1 and row2, leaving row3 empty.  \n   - Other columns: No merges, but tiles shift upward (e.g., Column 3’s 2 shifts to row0).  \n\n   After swiping UP, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 128|2|4|2  \n   Row 1: 16|8|0|0  \n   Row 2: 8|2|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   The 128 (largest tile) is positioned in the top-left corner, a strategic corner for future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Swiping down shifts tiles downward. Column 0 also merges the two 64s into 128 (score +128), but the 128 is placed in row1 (not a corner). Other columns shift tiles downward, but no additional merges occur. The 128 is not in a corner, making it less strategic for future moves.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping UP merges the two 64s into 128, placing the largest tile in the top-left corner (a strategic position). This maximizes score and sets up better future moves compared to other directions.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128|2|4|0\nRow 1: 16|8|0|0\nRow 2: 8|2|0|0\nRow 3: 0|2|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \nTiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). The board remains mostly unchanged, with minimal movement of zeros. No score gain. **Not optimal**.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nTiles shift right, but no merges occur (adjacent tiles are distinct). The board remains mostly unchanged, with zeros shifted to the left. No score gain. **Not optimal**.\n\n#### **UP**  \nTiles shift upward. In column 1 (vertical), the two 2s in rows 2 and 3 merge into a 4 (score +4). However, the largest tile (128) remains in the top-left corner, and no other merges or strategic positioning improvements occur. **Modest score gain but limited strategic value**.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \nTiles shift downward. Key observations:  \n- **Column 0 (vertical)**: 128 (row 0), 16 (row 1), 8 (row 2), 0 (row 3) shift down, moving 128 to the bottom-left corner (row 3, column 0)—a strong corner position for large tiles.  \n- **Column 1 (vertical)**: 2 (row 0), 8 (row 1), 2 (row 2), 2 (row 3) shift down. The two 2s in rows 2 and 3 merge into a 4 (score +4).  \n- **Row 1 (horizontal)**: After shifting down, 8 (column 0) and 8 (column 1) become adjacent—setting up a future left swipe to merge them into 16 (score +16).  \n- **Row 3 (horizontal)**: After shifting down, 4 (column 1) and 4 (column 2) become adjacent—setting up a future left swipe to merge them into 8 (score +8).  \n\nThe DOWN move positions the largest tile (128) in a corner, creates immediate merges (2s → 4), and sets up high-value future merges (8s and 4s). This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners and enabling subsequent merges.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nDOWN is the best move, as it optimizes tile positioning, generates immediate score, and sets up future merging opportunities.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (e.g., merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 128|2|0|0\nRow 2: 16|8|0|2\nRow 3: 8|4|4|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.  \n- **Row 1**: `128|2|0|0` → Shifts left to `128|2|0|0` (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: `16|8|0|2` → Shifts left to `16|8|2|0` (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: `8|4|4|0` → Shifts left, merging the two `4`s into `8`. Result: `8|8|0|0` (score +8).  \n\nAfter LEFT, larger tiles (128, 16, 8) remain aligned in the left column, facilitating future merges (e.g., 8 and 16 could merge if moved up).\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.  \n- **Row 1**: `128|2|0|0` → Shifts right to `0|0|128|2` (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: `16|8|0|2` → Shifts right to `0|16|8|2` (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: `8|4|4|0` → Shifts right, merging the two `4`s into `8`. Result: `0|0|8|8` (score +8).  \n\nAfter RIGHT, the 128 (largest tile) moves to column 2, disrupting the corner alignment and reducing opportunities for future merges.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed upward, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. Tiles shift but no merges occur. This move provides no score and does not improve tile alignment.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed downward, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. Tiles shift but no merges occur. This move provides no score and does not improve tile alignment.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT is optimal because it merges tiles (scoring 8), keeps the largest tile (128) in the top-left corner, and aligns smaller tiles (16, 8) in the left column for future merges. RIGHT moves the 128 away from the corner, reducing strategic potential. UP and DOWN provide no merges or strategic benefits.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the resulting board states, score gains, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 128|2|0|2\nRow 2: 16|8|2|0\nRow 3: 8|8|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.\n- **Row 1**: `[128, 2, 0, 2]` shifts left to `[128, 2, 2, 0]`, then merges the two `2`s into `4` (score +4).

The goal is to maximize tile merges, score, and maintain strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 0]  \nRow 1: [128, 4, 8, 0]  \nRow 2: [16, 8, 2, 0]  \nRow 3: [16, 0, 0, 0]  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:  \n- Row 0 remains unchanged (all zeros).  \n- Row 1: [128, 4, 8, 0] → No merges (tiles are already as left as possible).  \n- Row 2: [16, 8, 2, 0] → No merges (tiles are already as left as possible).  \n- Row 3: [16, 0, 0, 0] → No merges (16 is already leftmost).  \n**Result**: No merges, no score gain. Unhelpful.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n- Row 0 remains unchanged (all zeros).  \n- Row 1: [128, 4, 8, 0] → Tiles shift right to [0, 128, 4, 8]. No merges.  \n- Row 2: [16, 8, 2, 0] → Tiles shift right to [0, 16, 8, 2]. No merges.  \n- Row 3: [16, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right to [0, 0, 0, 16]. No merges.  \n**Result**: No merges, no score gain. Unhelpful.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:  \nTiles move upward, merging where possible. We analyze columns:  \n- **Column 0**: [0, 128, 16, 16] → Non-zero tiles [128, 16, 16]. Shift up to [128, 16, 16, 0]. The two 16s merge into 32, resulting in [128, 32, 0, 0]. Score +32.  \n- **Column 1**: [0, 4, 8, 0] → Non-zero tiles [4, 8]. Shift up to [4, 8, 0, 0]. No merges.  \n- **Column 2**: [0, 8, 2, 0] → Non-zero tiles [8, 2]. Shift up to [8, 2, 0, 0]. No merges.  \n- **Column 3**: All zeros. No change.  \n\n**Result**: Merges the two 16s into 32 (score +32). The 128 remains in the top-left corner (strategic corner positioning), and rows 2-3 are mostly empty, leaving room for future moves.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:  \nTiles move downward, merging where possible. We analyze columns:  \n- **Column 0**: [0, 128, 16, 16] → Non-zero tiles [128, 16, 16]. Shift down to [0, 16, 16, 128]. The two 16s merge into 32, resulting in [0, 0, 32, 128].

No merges.  \n- **Column 3**: All zeros. No change.  \n\n**Result**: Merges the two 16s into 32 (score +32). However, the 128 is moved to the bottom-left corner, and rows 0-1 are empty. While functional, the top-left corner (where 128 was originally) is more strategically valuable for long-term merging.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe UP swipe merges the two 16s for a score gain, keeps the largest tile (128) in a strategic corner (top-left), and leaves significant empty space for future moves. This is the optimal choice.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential, score gain, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [128, 4, 8, 0] → Shifts left to [128, 4, 8, 0] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [32, 8, 2, 0] → Shifts left to [32, 8, 2, 0] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [0, 0, 0, 0] → No change.\n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 2, 0] → Shifts left to [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).\n- **Result**: No merges, score = 0. Larger tiles (128, 32) remain scattered, no strategic benefit.\n\n\n### RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [128, 4, 8, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 128, 4, 8] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [32, 8, 2, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 32, 8, 2] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [0, 0, 0, 0] → No change.\n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 2, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merges).\n- **Result**: No merges, score = 0. Larger tiles (128, 32) are pushed right, but no strategic advantage.\n\n\n### UP Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: [128, 32, 0, 0] → Shifts up to [128, 32, 0, 0] (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [4, 8, 0, 0] → Shifts up to [4, 8, 0, 0] (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: [8, 2, 0, 2] → Shifts up to [8, 2, 2, 0], then merges the two 2s into 4 → [8, 4, 0, 0]. Score += 4.\n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 0, 0] → No change.\n- **Result**: Merges 2+2 into 4 (score 4). The largest tile (128) remains in the top-left corner (strategically optimal), and smaller tiles align vertically for potential future merges.\n\n\n### DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: [128, 32, 0, 0] → Shifts down to [0, 0, 128, 32] (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [4, 8, 0, 0] → Shifts down to [0, 0, 4, 8] (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: [8, 2, 0, 2] → Shifts down to [0, 8, 2, 2], then merges the two 2s into 4 → [0, 8, 4, 0]. Score += 4.\n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 0, 0] → No change.\n- **Result**: Merges 2+2 into 4 (score 4). However, the largest tile (128) moves to row 2, column 0 (not a corner), reducing strategic positioning.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and DOWN yield a score of 4, but UP keeps the largest tile (128) in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and aligns smaller tiles vertically for future merges. This makes UP the better choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners, and maximizing future merges).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128|4|8|0\nRow 1: 32|8|4|0\nRow 2: 0|0|16|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left. Row 0 and Row 1 remain unchanged (no merges or movement into empty spaces). Row 2 shifts 16 to the first position (16|0|0|0).  \n   - No merges occur, so no score gain. The 128 remains in the top-left corner, but no future merges are set up.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right. Row 0 becomes 0|128|4|8, Row 1 becomes 0|32|8|4, and Row 2 becomes 0|0|0|16.  \n   - The 128 (largest tile) moves from the corner to the middle, which is suboptimal. No merges occur, so no score gain.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift up. Columns 0, 1, 2, and 3 have no merges or movement (tiles are already as high as possible).  \n   - No change to the board. Not a valid move.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down. Columns are processed from bottom to top:  \n     - Column 0: 128 (Row 0) and 32 (Row 1) move to Row 2 and 3 → [0,0,128,32].  \n     - Column 1: 4 (Row 0) and 8 (Row 1) move to Row 2 and 3 → [0,0,4,8].  \n     - Column 2: 8 (Row 0), 4 (Row 1), and 16 (Row 2) move to Row 3, 2, and 1 → [0,16,4,8].  \n     - Column 3: Remains [0,0,0,0].  \n   - Resulting board after DOWN:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|16|0  \n     Row 2: 128|4|4|0  \n     Row 3: 32|8|8|0  \n     ```  \n   - This sets up horizontal adjacents for future merges: two 4s in Row 2 (columns 1-2) and two 8s in Row 3 (columns 1-2). Swiping LEFT next would merge these, generating scores (8 and 16, respectively).  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nDOWN is the best move. It positions tiles to enable future merges, maintains larger tiles in the lower half (potential corner strategy), and avoids displacing the largest tile (128) from a strategic position.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize score and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|8|0  \nRow 2: 128|4|4|0  \nRow 3: 32|8|16|16  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **Left Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,8,0] → Shifts left to [8,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [128,4,4,0] → 4 and 4 merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in [128,8,0,0].  \n- **Row 3**: [32,8,16,16] → 16 and 16 merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in [32,8,32,0].  \n- **Total Score**: 8 + 32 = 40.  \n- **Large Tiles Position**: 128 remains in the top-left corner (row 2, column 0), which is strategic.  \n\n\n#### **Right Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,8,0] → Shifts right to [0,0,0,8] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [128,4,4,0] → 4 and 4 merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in [0,0,128,8].  \n- **Row 3**: [32,8,16,16] → 16 and 16 merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in [0,32,8,32].  \n- **Total Score**: 8 + 32 = 40.  \n- **Large Tiles Position**: 128 moves to row 2, column 2 (not a corner), which is less strategic.  \n\n\n#### **Up Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed top to bottom. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column, so no merges occur.  \n- **Total Score**: 0.  \n\n\n#### **Down Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed bottom to top. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column, so no merges occur.  \n- **Total Score**: 0.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLeft and right swipes yield the same score (40), but left keeps the largest tile (128) in the top-left corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners. Thus, left is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize score through merging and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 2\nRow 1: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 128 | 8 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 32 | 8 | 32 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. The 2 in Row 0 moves to the first position, but all other rows remain mostly unchanged. No score gain.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur. The 8 in Row 1 moves to the last position, and the 128 and 8 in Row 2 shift right, but no tiles merge. No score gain.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Columns are processed top to bottom. In Column 1 (values `0, 0, 8, 8`), the two 8s shift up to Rows 0 and 1, then merge into 16 (score +16). Other columns (0, 2, 3) shift tiles up but no additional merges. The resulting board has 16 in Row 0, Column 1, but larger tiles (128, 32) are spread across rows 1 and 2.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Columns are processed bottom to top. In Column 1 (values `0, 0, 8, 8`), the two 8s shift down to Rows 2 and 3, then merge into 16 (score +16). Other columns shift tiles down, with 32s in Row 3, Columns 0 and 2, and 2 in Row 3, Column 3. Larger tiles (128, 32) remain in lower rows, closer to the bottom edge, which aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nBoth UP and DOWN merge the 8s in Column 1 for a score of 16. However, moving DOWN positions larger tiles (128, 32) in lower rows, which is more strategic for future merges. This aligns with the example provided, where merging tiles in a column by moving down was optimal.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to merge tiles for higher scores and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|2|0\nRow 1: 8|0|0|0\nRow 2: 128|0|0|0\nRow 3: 32|16|32|2\n```\nKey observations:\n- No adjacent tiles of the same value exist initially, so merges depend on shifting tiles into positions where they can combine.\n- Larger tiles (128, 32, 16, 8) are concentrated in the left half of the grid, suggesting keeping them in the left corner (a common strategy) is beneficial.\n- Smaller tiles (2s) are scattered and can potentially be merged with strategic shifts.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,2,0] → Shifts to [2,0,0,0] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [8,0,0,0] → Shifts to [8,0,0,0] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [128,0,0,0] → Shifts to [128,0,0,0] (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: [32,16,32,2] → Shifts to [32,16,32,2] (no merges).\n- **Outcome**: No merges. Tiles shift left, but no new opportunities for immediate merging.\n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,2,0] → Shifts to [0,0,0,2] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [8,0,0,0] → Shifts to [0,0,0,8] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [128,0,0,0] → Shifts to [0,0,0,128] (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: [32,16,32,2] → Shifts to [32,16,32,2] (no merges).\n- **Outcome**: No merges. Larger tiles (e.g., 128) move to the right edge, potentially isolating them from future merges.\n\n#### 3. UP:\n- **Column 0**: [0,8,128,32] → Shifts to [8,128,32,0] (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,16] → Shifts to [16,0,0,0] (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: [2,0,0,32] → Shifts to [2,32,0,0] (no merges).\n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,2] → Shifts to [2,0,0,0] (no merges).\n- **Critical Observation**: After shifting, Row 0 becomes [8,16,2,2]. The two 2s in Row 0, Columns 2 and 3 are now adjacent horizontally. This sets up a future LEFT swipe to merge them into a 4, creating a small but valuable merge opportunity.\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: [0,8,128,32] → Shifts to [0,8,128,32] (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,16] → Shifts to [0,0,0,16] (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: [2,0,0,32] → Shifts to [0,0,2,32] (no merges).\n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,2] → Shifts to [0,0,0,2] (no merges).\n- **Outcome**: No merges. Tiles shift down, but no meaningful setup for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP move positions two 2s in Row 0, Columns 2 and 3, creating a horizontal adjacency. This sets up a future LEFT swipe to merge them into a 4, which is strategically valuable. Other moves (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) do not create such opportunities. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile alignment, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 16 | 2 | 2  \nRow 1: 128 | 0 | 32 | 0  \nRow 2: 32 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 4 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1.

New row: `4 | 0 | 0 | 0`.  \n\nResult: Larger tiles (128, 32, 32, 8, 16) align on the left, maintaining a corner strategy. A merge occurs, gaining 4 points.  \n\n\n#### 2. RIGHT  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4). New row: `0 | 8 | 16 | 4`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right. 128 and 32 move to columns 1 and 2. New row: `0 | 128 | 32 | 0`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right. 32 moves to column 3. New row: `0 | 0 | 0 | 32`.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right. 4 moves to column 3. New row: `0 | 0 | 0 | 4`.  \n\nResult: Larger tiles (128, 32, 32, 4) spread to the right, losing the corner alignment.  \n\n\n#### 3. UP  \n- **Column 0**: 8, 128, 32, 0 shift up (no merges). New column: `8 | 128 | 32 | 0`.  \n- **Column 1**: 16, 0, 0, 4 shift up (no merges). New column: `16 | 4 | 0 | 0`.  \n- **Column 2**: 2, 32, 0, 0 shift up (no merges). New column: `2 | 32 | 0 | 0`.  \n- **Column 3**: 2, 0, 0, 0 shift up (no merges). New column: `2 | 0 | 0 | 0`.  \n\nResult: No merges occur. Tiles remain scattered with no strategic alignment.  \n\n\n#### 4. DOWN  \n- **Column 0**: 8, 128, 32, 0 shift down (no merges). New column: `0 | 8 | 128 | 32`.  \n- **Column 1**: 16, 0, 0, 4 shift down (no merges). New column: `0 | 0 | 16 | 4`.  \n- **Column 2**: 2, 32, 0, 0 shift down (no merges). New column: `0 | 0 | 2 | 32`.  \n- **Column 3**: 2, 0, 0, 0 shift down (no merges). New column: `0 | 0 | 0 | 2`.  \n\nResult: No merges occur. Tiles spread downward, disrupting corner alignment.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT is the best move. It merges the two 2s in Row 0 (gaining 4 points) and aligns larger tiles (128, 32, 32, 8, 16) on the left, maintaining a corner strategy for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8|16|4|0\nRow 1:128|32|0|0\nRow 2:32|4|0|0\nRow 3:4|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All non-zero tiles are already left-aligned in their rows. Swiping left would not move any tiles or create merges. **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, filling empty spaces. For example:  \n   - Row 0: `8|16|4|0` → `0|8|16|4` (tiles shift right).  \n   - Row 1: `128|32|0|0` → `0|0|128|32` (tiles shift right).  \n   - Row 2: `32|4|0|0` → `0|0|32|4` (tiles shift right).  \n   - Row 3: `4|0|0|0` → `0|0|0|4` (tile shifts right).  \n   This is a valid move, but no merges occur, and larger tiles (e.g., 128) end up in non-corner positions, which is suboptimal for long-term strategy.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up, but all non-zero tiles in columns are already as high as possible (no empty spaces above them). Swiping up would not move any tiles. **Invalid move**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down, filling empty spaces. For example:  \n   - Column 0: `8|128|32|4` (no zeros, so no movement).  \n   - Column 1: `16|32|4|0` → `0|16|32|4` (tiles shift down).  \n   - Column 2: `4|0|0|0` → `0|0|0|4` (tile shifts down).  \n   - Column 3: All zeros (no change).  \n   After shifting, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0:8|0|0|0  \n   Row 1:128|16|0|0  \n   Row 2:32|32|0|0  \n   Row 3:4|4|4|0  \n   ```  \n   This is a valid move. Importantly, the largest tile (128) remains in the top-left area, and smaller tiles (32s, 4s) are positioned to enable future merges (e.g., merging the 32s in Row 2 with a subsequent LEFT swipe). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners and setting up for strategic merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move, as it positions tiles to enable future merges and keeps larger tiles in favorable positions.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the current game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|2|0|0  \nRow 1: 128|16|0|0  \nRow 2: 32|32|0|0  \nRow 3: 4|4|4|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [8, 2, 0, 0] → Shifts left with no merges (tiles: 8, 2, 0, 0).  \n- **Row 1**: [128, 16, 0, 0] → Shifts left with no merges (tiles: 128, 16, 0, 0).  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 32, 0, 0] → Merges 32 + 32 = 64 (score +64; tiles: 64, 0, 0, 0).  \n- **Row 3**: [4, 4, 4, 0] → Merges first two 4s into 8 (score +8; tiles: 8, 4, 0, 0).  \n**Total Score**: 64 + 8 = 72.  \n**Resulting Board**:  \nRow 0: 8|2|0|0  \nRow 1: 128|16|0|0  \nRow 2: 64|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 8|4|0|0  \n**Strategy Alignment**: Larger tiles (128, 64, 8) cluster on the left, maintaining a corner focus (optimal for future merges).  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [8, 2, 0, 0] → Shifts right with no merges (tiles: 0, 0, 8, 2).  \n- **Row 1**: [128, 16, 0, 0] → Shifts right with no merges (tiles: 0, 0, 128, 16).  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 32, 0, 0] → Merges 32 + 32 = 64 (score +64; tiles: 0, 0, 0, 64).  \n- **Row 3**: [4, 4, 4, 0] → Merges last two 4s into 8 (score +8; tiles: 0, 4, 8, 0).  \n**Total Score**: 64 + 8 = 72.  \n**Resulting Board**:  \nRow 0: 0|0|8|2  \nRow 1: 0|0|128|16  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|64  \nRow 3: 0|4|8|0  \n**Strategy Alignment**: Larger tiles cluster on the right, but empty spaces are on the left, which may disrupt future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP\/DOWN Swipes**:\n- **UP Swipe**: Columns shift upward, but no adjacent equal tiles exist (no merges, score 0).  \n- **DOWN Swipe**: Columns shift downward, but no adjacent equal tiles exist (no merges, score 0).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 72 points, but LEFT better aligns with the strategy of clustering larger tiles in a corner (left) and minimizing disruption from new tile spawns (empty spaces on the right).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the resulting state, focusing on merging opportunities and tile positioning (especially larger tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|2|0|0  \nRow 1: 128|16|0|0  \nRow 2: 64|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 8|4|0|4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [8, 2, 0, 0] → Shifts left with no merges (8 and 2 are distinct).

This setup also positions row 3’s 8s for potential future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize merges, score, and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|2|0|0\nRow 1: 128|16|2|0\nRow 2: 64|0|0|0\nRow 3: 8|8|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   Each row is processed left to right.  \n   - Row 0: `8|2|0|0` → No merges (8 and 2 are distinct).  \n   - Row 1: `128|16|2|0` → No merges (all distinct).  \n   - Row 2: `64|0|0|0` → No merges (only 64).  \n   - Row 3: `8|8|0|0` → The two 8s merge into 16, adding 16 to the score. The row becomes `16|0|0|0`.  \n\n   After a LEFT move, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 8|2|0|0  \n   Row 1: 128|16|2|0  \n   Row 2: 64|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 16|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   This move merges the 8s in Row 3, scores 16, and keeps larger tiles (128, 64) in the left column, aligning with the strategy of grouping large tiles in a corner.\n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   Each row is processed right to left.  \n   - Row 0: `8|2|0|0` → Tiles shift right to `0|0|8|2` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: `128|16|2|0` → Tiles shift right to `0|128|16|2` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: `64|0|0|0` → Tiles shift right to `0|0|0|64` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: `8|8|0|0` → The two 8s merge into 16, adding 16 to the score. The row becomes `0|0|0|16`.  \n\n   After a RIGHT move, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|8|2  \n   Row 1: 0|128|16|2  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|64  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|16  \n   ```  \n   This move also merges the 8s in Row 3 but scatters larger tiles (128, 64) away from the left corner, which is less strategic.\n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   Columns are processed top to bottom. No merges occur because all non-zero tiles in columns are distinct (e.g., Column 0: 8, 128, 64, 8; Column 1: 2, 16, 0, 8). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain. This is suboptimal.\n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   Columns are processed bottom to top. No merges occur because non-zero tiles in columns are distinct (e.g., Column 0: 8, 128, 64, 8; Column 1: 2, 16, 0, 8). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain. This is also suboptimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only moves that generate merges are LEFT and RIGHT. LEFT is preferred because it merges the 8s in Row 3, scores 16, and keeps larger tiles (128, 64) in the left column, aligning with the strategy of grouping large tiles in a corner for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and the goal of setting up future merges while keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 64 | 0  \nRow 1: 128 | 16 | 2 | 0  \nRow 2: 64 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). The board remains nearly unchanged, with 0s still on the right. No meaningful progress.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). The board rearranges with 0s on the left, but this does not create obvious opportunities for future merges.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in columns are distinct). The board remains nearly unchanged, with 0s still in lower rows. No meaningful progress.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down. Let’s process columns:  \n   - **Column 0**: [8, 128, 64, 16] (no merges, distinct values).  \n   - **Column 1**: [2, 16, 0, 0] → shifts to [0, 16, 2, 0] (no merges).  \n   - **Column 2**: [64, 2, 0, 0] → shifts to [0, 64, 2, 0] (no merges).  \n   - **Column 3**: All 0s (no change).  \n\n   After shifting down, the board becomes:  \n   Row 0: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 1: 128 | 16 | 64 | 0  \n   Row 2: 64 | 2 | 2 | 0  \n   Row 3: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n   Notably, row 2 now has two adjacent 2s (columns 1 and 2). While these do not merge in the current DOWN move (merging only occurs in the direction of the swipe, which is vertical for DOWN), this sets up a future LEFT swipe to merge these 2s into a 4, creating a strategic advantage.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move because it positions two 2s adjacently in row 2, enabling a potential merge in the next move (e.g., a subsequent LEFT swipe). This aligns with the strategy of setting up future merges to maximize scores.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

Larger tiles (128s) are positioned in Row 1 (columns 0 and 2), aligning horizontally for potential future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Column 0: 8, 128, 64, 16 (no merge).  \n- Column 1: 0, 0, 2, 16 → 2 and 16 shift down (no merge).  \n- Column 2: 0, 64, 64, 2 → 64 and 64 merge into 128 (score +128).  \n- Column 3: All zeros (no change).  \n**Result**: 128 points from Column 2. However, the merged 128 is positioned in Row 2 (column 2), making future merges with the existing 128 (Row 1, column 0) less likely.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and DOWN yield 128 points, but UP positions the merged 128 in Row 1 (column 2), adjacent to the existing 128 in Row 1 (column 0). This horizontal alignment increases the potential for future merges (e.g., via LEFT\/RIGHT swipes). Thus, UP is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their impact on the game board, focusing on potential merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 2 | 128 | 0\nRow 1: 128 | 16 | 2 | 0\nRow 2: 64 | 4 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \nTiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur. The board remains nearly unchanged, with no strategic advantage.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nTiles shift right. Let’s process each row:  \n- **Row 0**: [8, 2, 128, 0] → Tiles shift right: 0 | 2 | 128 | 8 (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [128, 16, 2, 0] → Tiles shift right: 0 | 2 | 16 | 128 (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [64, 4, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right: 0 | 0 | 64 | 4 (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [16, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right: 0 | 0 | 0 | 16 (no merges).  \n\nAfter swiping RIGHT, the board becomes:  \n```\nRow 0: 0 | 2 | 128 | 8  \nRow 1: 0 | 2 | 16 | 128  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 64 | 4  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 16  \n```  \n\nNotably, **column 1 now has two 2s (Row 0, Column 1 and Row 1, Column 1)**. This sets up a future merge opportunity (e.g., swiping UP next would merge these 2s into a 4, earning 4 points).  \n\n#### **UP**  \nTiles shift up, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. No merges occur. The board remains unchanged, with no strategic benefit.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \nTiles shift down. Processing each column:  \n- **Column 0**: [8, 128, 64, 16] → No shifts (all tiles are non-zero).  \n- **Column 1**: [2, 16, 4, 0] → Tiles shift down: 0 | 2 | 16 | 4 (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [128, 2, 0, 0] → Tiles shift down: 0 | 0 | 128 | 2 (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: All zeros → No change.  \n\nAfter swiping DOWN, the board has no immediate merge opportunities and does not position larger tiles (e.g., 128s) advantageously.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwipping RIGHT positions two 2s in the same column (Column 1), creating a future merge opportunity. This aligns with the strategy of setting up merges for higher scores.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning of large tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|8|2|128\nRow 1: 4|128|16|2\nRow 2: 0|0|64|4\nRow 3: 0|0|0|16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left → `8|2|128|0` (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: No empty spaces, so tiles remain → `4|128|16|2` (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left → `64|4|0|0` (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left → `16|0|0|0` (no merges).\n- **Outcome**: Tiles shift into empty spaces but no merges. The largest tile (128 in Row 0, Column 3) is moved out of the corner, which is suboptimal.\n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles cannot shift right (blocked by 128 in Column 3) → no change.\n- **Row 1**: No empty spaces, so tiles remain → no change.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles cannot shift right (blocked by 4 in Column 3) → no change.\n- **Row 3**: Tiles cannot shift right (16 is already in Column 3) → no change.\n- **Outcome**: No movement or merges. Invalid move.\n\n#### 3. UP:\n- **Column 0**: 4 shifts up from Row 1 to Row 0 → `4|0|0|0`.\n- **Column 1**: 8 and 128 remain in Rows 0 and 1 (no merges) → `8|128|0|0`.\n- **Column 2**: 2, 16, 64 remain in Rows 0-2 (no merges) → `2|16|64|0`.\n- **Column 3**: 128, 2, 4, 16 remain (no merges) → `128|2|4|16`.\n- **Outcome**: Tiles shift into empty spaces but no merges. The 128 in Row 0, Column 3 (top-right corner) is preserved, but no immediate merging opportunities are created.\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: 4 shifts down from Row 1 to Row 3 → `0|0|0|4`.\n- **Column 1**: 128 shifts down from Row 1 to Row 2, and 8 shifts down from Row 0 to Row 3 → `0|0|128|8`.\n- **Column 2**: 64 shifts down from Row 2 to Row 3, 16 shifts down to Row 2, and 2 shifts down to Row 1 → `0|2|16|64`.\n- **Column 3**: Tiles remain (no merges) → `128|2|4|16`.\n- **Key Observation**: After shifting, Row 1 becomes `0|0|2|2`, creating adjacent 2s. This sets up a future merge opportunity (e.g., moving RIGHT next turn to merge the 2s into a 4). The largest tile (128 in Row 0, Column 3) remains in the top-right corner, maintaining strategic positioning.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move. It preserves the large tile (128) in the corner, shifts smaller tiles to create a merge opportunity (2s in Row 1), and aligns with the strategy of building toward higher-scoring merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize immediate score and position larger tiles strategically (preferably in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|128\nRow 1: 0|0|2|2\nRow 2: 64|8|16|4\nRow 3: 4|128|64|16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: [0,0,0,128] → Tiles shift left, resulting in [128,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - **Row 1**: [0,0,2,2] → Tiles shift left, merging the two 2s into 4 (score +4). Result: [4,0,0,0].  \n   - **Row 2**: [64,8,16,4] → All distinct, so no merges. Result: [64,8,16,4].  \n   - **Row 3**: [4,128,64,16] → All distinct, so no merges. Result: [4,128,64,16].  \n   **Outcome**: 128 (row 0) moves to the top-left corner (strategic), and a 4 is formed in row 1 (score +4).  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: [0,0,0,128] → Tiles are already right-aligned (no change).  \n   - **Row 1**: [0,0,2,2] → Tiles shift right, merging the two 2s into 4 (score +4). Result: [0,0,0,4].  \n   - **Row 2**: [64,8,16,4] → All distinct, so no merges (no change).  \n   - **Row 3**: [4,128,64,16] → All distinct, so no merges (no change).  \n   **Outcome**: 128 (row 0) remains in the top-right corner, and a 4 is formed in row 1 (score +4).  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed top-to-bottom. No merges occur because all non-zero tiles in columns are distinct.  \n   **Outcome**: No score gain; tiles shift up but remain unmerged.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom-to-top. No merges occur because all non-zero tiles in columns are distinct.  \n   **Outcome**: No score gain; tiles shift down but remain unmerged.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield a +4 score from merging 2s in row 1. However, LEFT swiping moves the 128 (row 0) to the top-left corner, a strategic position to build larger tiles. RIGHT leaves the 128 in the top-right corner but does not improve positioning as effectively. Thus, LEFT is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score through merging and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 2 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 16 | 4  \nRow 3: 4 | 128 | 64 | 16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles in all rows are already left-aligned (no empty spaces to the left of non-zero tiles). No movement or merging occurs.  \n   - **Invalid**: No valid moves (no tiles shift or merge).  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [128, 2, 0, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 128, 2].  \n   - Row 1: [4, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 0, 4].  \n   - Rows 2 and 3: Tiles are already right-aligned (no empty spaces to the right of non-zero tiles). No merging.  \n   - **Valid but no merges**: Only shifts tiles right, no score gain.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 1: [2, 0, 8, 128] → Shifts up to [2, 8, 128, 0].  \n   - Column 2: [0, 0, 16, 64] → Shifts up to [16, 64, 0, 0].  \n   - Column 3: [0, 0, 4, 16] → Shifts up to [4, 16, 0, 0].  \n   - Column 0: [128, 4, 64, 4] → No movement (all tiles filled).  \n   - **Valid but no merges**: Tiles shift up, no score gain.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 1: [2, 0, 8, 128] → Shifts down to [0, 2, 8, 128].  \n   - Columns 2 and 3: Tiles remain in place (no empty spaces below non-zero tiles).  \n   - Column 0: [128, 4, 64, 4] → No movement (all tiles filled).  \n   - **Valid but no merges**: Tiles shift down, no score gain.  \n\n\n### Strategy Consideration:  \nAll valid moves (RIGHT, UP, DOWN) do not result in immediate merges. However, the key strategic principle is to keep larger tiles in corners to facilitate future merges. The largest tiles (128s) are currently in the top-left (Row 0, Col 0) and bottom-middle (Row 3, Col 1). Swiping DOWN keeps the top-left 128 in a corner and positions smaller tiles (e.g., 2, 8) in lower rows, potentially creating future merge opportunities.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to merge tiles for higher scores and strategically position larger tiles for future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 0 | 0 | 32\nRow 1: 4 | 2 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 16 | 4\nRow 3: 4 | 128 | 64 | 16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift left, filling empty spaces.  \n   - Row 0: `128, 0, 0, 32` → `128, 32, 0, 0` (no merges, 32 moves left).  \n   - Row 1: `4, 2, 0, 0` → `4, 2, 0, 0` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: `64, 8, 16, 4` (no empty spaces, no change).  \n   - Row 3: `4, 128, 64, 16` (no empty spaces, no change).  \n   Result: No merges, but 32 in Row 0 shifts closer to 128 (top-left corner), improving future merge potential.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right, filling empty spaces.  \n   - Row 0: `128, 0, 0, 32` → `0, 0, 128, 32` (no merges, 128 moves right, away from the corner).  \n   - Row 1: `4, 2, 0, 0` → `0, 0, 4, 2` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: `64, 8, 16, 4` (no empty spaces, no change).  \n   - Row 3: `4, 128, 64, 16` (no empty spaces, no change).  \n   Result: No merges, and 128 in Row 0 moves away from the top-left corner, reducing future merge potential.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift up, filling empty spaces.  \n   - Column 0: `128, 4, 64, 4` (no empty spaces, no change).  \n   - Column 1: `0, 2, 8, 128` → `2, 8, 128, 0` (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: `0, 0, 16, 64` → `16, 64, 0, 0` (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: `32, 0, 4, 16` → `32, 4, 16, 0` (no merges).  \n   Result: No merges, and larger tiles (e.g., 128 in Column 1) move upward but not into a corner, reducing strategic positioning.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift down, filling empty spaces.  \n   - Column 0: `128, 4, 64, 4` (no empty spaces, no change).  \n   - Column 1: `0, 2, 8, 128` (no empty spaces, no change).  \n   - Column 2: `0, 0, 16, 64` (no empty spaces, no change).  \n   - Column 3: `32, 0, 4, 16` → `0, 32, 4, 16` (no merges).  \n   Result: No merges, and 32 in Column 3 shifts down, away from the top-left corner.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the directions result in immediate merges. However, **LEFT** is optimal because it shifts the 32 in Row 0 closer to the 128 in the top-left corner, enhancing the potential for future merges. Larger tiles remain in strategic positions (e.g., 128 in Row 0, Column 0), aligning with the goal of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### **LEFT Swipe**  \nAll rows are already left-aligned with no empty spaces between tiles. No tiles can move left, and there are no adjacent equal tiles to merge. This is not a valid move.\n\n### **RIGHT Swipe**  \nTiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles exist to merge. Rows 0 and 1 will have tiles shift into empty spaces (e.g., row 0 becomes `0|128|32|16`), but no merges occur. While valid, it does not contribute to score or strategic tile grouping.\n\n### **UP Swipe**  \nColumns are processed top-to-bottom. Key observations:  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles are `16|0|16|64` (row 0 to 3). Removing zeros gives `[16, 16, 64]`. The two `16`s merge into `32` (score += 32), resulting in `[32, 64, 0, 0]` for the column.  \n- Other columns have no merges but shift tiles up where possible (e.g., column 3 becomes `4|16|0|0`).  \n\nAfter the up swipe, the board becomes:  \nRow 0: `128|32|32|4` (adjacent `32`s in columns 1-2, potential for future left-swipe merge)  \nRow 1: `4|2|64|16`  \nRow 2: `64|8|0|0`  \nRow 3: `4|128|0|0`  \n\nThis move creates adjacent `32`s in the top row, enabling future merges and keeps the largest tile (`128`) in the top-left corner, aligning with strategic goals.\n\n### **DOWN Swipe**  \nColumns are processed bottom-to-top. Key observations:  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles are `16|0|16|64` (row 0 to 3). Removing zeros gives `[16, 16, 64]`. The two `16`s merge into `32` (score += 32), resulting in `[0, 0, 32, 64]` for the column.  \n- Other columns have no merges.  \n\nAfter the down swipe, the board becomes:  \nRow 0: `128|32|0|0`  \nRow 1: `4|2|0|0`  \nRow 2: `64|8|32|4`  \nRow 3: `4|128|64|16`  \n\nWhile merging occurs, the merged `32` is isolated in row 2, reducing future merge potential compared to the up swipe.\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe UP swipe is optimal because it merges two `16`s into a `32` (scoring 32 points), creates adjacent `32`s in the top row (enabling future merges), and keeps the largest tile (`128`) in the top-left corner.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128|32|32|4\nRow 1: 4|2|64|16\nRow 2: 64|8|0|0\nRow 3: 4|128|16|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles `32` and `32` merge into `64` (score +64). The row becomes `128|64|4|0`.  \n- **Row 1**: No merges (all tiles are distinct). Row remains `4|2|64|16`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left but no merges. Row remains `64|8|0|0`.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left but no merges. Row remains `4|128|16|0`.  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 32s in Row 0 for 64 points. The largest tile (128) stays in the top-left corner, a strategic position.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles `32` and `32` merge into `64` (score +64). The row becomes `0|128|64|4`.  \n- **Row 1**: No merges. Row remains `4|2|64|16`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right, becoming `0|0|64|8`.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right, becoming `0|4|128|16`.  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 32s in Row 0 for 64 points, but the largest tile (128) moves to Row 0, Column 1 (not a corner), which is suboptimal.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Columns**: No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges. Tiles shift up but remain mostly unchanged.  \n- **Outcome**: No merges (0 points). No strategic benefit.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Columns**: No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges. Tiles shift down but remain mostly unchanged.  \n- **Outcome**: No merges (0 points). No strategic benefit.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT is the best move. It merges the 32s in Row 0 for 64 points and keeps the largest tile (128) in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize tile merges and maintain a strategic structure (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128|64|4|0\nRow 1: 4|2|64|16\nRow 2: 64|8|16|0\nRow 3: 4|128|16|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT Moves**:  \n   - **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row to merge. The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n   - **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right, but similarly, no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row to merge. No score gain.  \n\n2. **UP Move**:  \n   - Columns are processed from top to bottom. Key observation:  \n     - **Column 2** (tiles: 4, 64, 16, 16): The two 16s (rows 2 and 3) are adjacent when shifted up. They merge into a 32, adding 32 to the score.  \n   - After merging, the board structure becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 128|64|4|16  \n     Row 1: 4|2|64|0  \n     Row 2: 64|8|32|0  \n     Row 3: 4|128|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - Large tiles (128, 64) remain in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future merges.  \n\n3. **DOWN Move**:  \n   - Columns are processed from bottom to top. Key observation:  \n     - **Column 2** (tiles: 4, 64, 16, 16): The two 16s (rows 2 and 3) are adjacent when shifted down. They merge into a 32, adding 32 to the score.  \n   - After merging, the board structure becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 128|64|0|0  \n     Row 1: 4|2|4|0  \n     Row 2: 64|8|64|0  \n     Row 3: 4|128|32|16  \n     ```  \n   - While this also merges the 16s, the 128 in row 3 (column 1) is not in a corner, making it less strategic for future moves.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nBoth UP and DOWN merge the 16s for 32 points, but UP keeps large tiles (128, 64) in the top-left corner, which is better for long-term strategy.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify which direction maximizes strategic positioning for future merges, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners and minimizing disruption to high-value tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 64 | 4 | 16\nRow 1: 4 | 2 | 64 | 0\nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 32 | 0\nRow 3: 4 | 128 | 0 | 2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist to merge.  \n   - Row 0: [128, 64, 4, 16] (no change).  \n   - Row 1: [4, 2, 64, 0] (no change, as 0 is on the right).  \n   - Row 2: [64, 8, 32, 0] (no change).  \n   - Row 3: [4, 128, 2, 0] (2 shifts from column 3 to 2, 0 moves to column 3).  \n   - No merges occur; minimal tile movement.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, with empty spaces (0s) on the right.  \n   - Row 0: [128, 64, 4, 16] (no change, no 0s).  \n   - Row 1: [0, 4, 2, 64] (64 shifts from column 2 to 3).  \n   - Row 2: [0, 64, 8, 32] (32 shifts from column 2 to 3).  \n   - Row 3: [0, 4, 128, 2] (2 shifts from column 3 to 3, 4 shifts left).  \n   - No merges, but tiles in rows 1, 2, and 3 shift toward the right edge, potentially grouping smaller tiles for future merges.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift up, with empty spaces (0s) in lower rows.  \n   - Column 0: [128, 4, 64, 4] (no change, no 0s).  \n   - Column 1: [64, 2, 8, 128] (no change, no 0s).  \n   - Column 2: [4, 64, 32, 0] (no change, 0 remains in row 3).  \n   - Column 3: [16, 2, 0, 0] (2 shifts from row 3 to 1, 0s in rows 2 and 3).  \n   - No merges; only column 3 experiences minor movement.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift down, with empty spaces (0s) in upper rows.  \n   - Column 0: [128, 4, 64, 4] (no change, no 0s).  \n   - Column 1: [64, 2, 8, 128] (no change, no 0s).  \n   - Column 2: [0, 4, 64, 32] (4 shifts from row 0 to 1, 64 to row 2, 32 to row 3).  \n   - Column 3: [0, 0, 16, 2] (16 shifts from row 0 to 2, 2 remains in row 3).  \n   - No merges; column 2 and 3 experience movement but disrupt the alignment of larger tiles.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe key strategy is to keep larger tiles (e.g., 128 in row 0, column 0) in corners and arrange smaller tiles to enable future merges. Swiping RIGHT shifts smaller tiles (4, 2, 32, 2) toward the right edge, grouping them and creating potential for future merges. This direction avoids displacing the 128 in the top-left corner and positions smaller tiles for strategic growth.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile positioning, and strategic placement of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 64 | 4 | 16\nRow 1: 8 | 4 | 2 | 64\nRow 2: 0 | 64 | 8 | 32\nRow 3: 0 | 4 | 128 | 2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### 1. **Swipe LEFT**:\n- **Row 0**: All tiles are non-zero and distinct (128, 64, 4, 16). No merges or shifts.\n- **Row 1**: All tiles are non-zero and distinct (8, 4, 2, 64). No merges or shifts.\n- **Row 2**: [0, 64, 8, 32] → Shifts left to [64, 8, 32, 0] (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: [0, 4, 128, 2] → Shifts left to [4, 128, 2, 0] (no merges).\n\n  After swiping LEFT, no merges occur, but zeros are moved to the right end of rows 2 and 3. This leaves space for new tiles (2\/4) to spawn on the right, which is strategic for future merges. The largest tile (128) remains in the top-left corner, a strong position.\n\n#### 2. **Swipe RIGHT**:\n- **Row 0**: All tiles are non-zero and distinct (128, 64, 4, 16). No merges or shifts.\n- **Row 1**: All tiles are non-zero and distinct (8, 4, 2, 64). No merges or shifts.\n- **Row 2**: [0, 64, 8, 32] → No shifts (tiles are already right-aligned).\n- **Row 3**: [0, 4, 128, 2] → No shifts (tiles are already right-aligned).\n\n  Swiping RIGHT results in no merges or meaningful shifts. Zeros remain on the left, which is less optimal for future merges.\n\n#### 3. **Swipe UP**:\n- **Column 0**: [128, 8, 0, 0] → Shifts up to [128, 8, 0, 0] (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [64, 4, 64, 4] → No shifts (tiles are already top-aligned).\n- **Column 2**: [4, 2, 8, 128] → No shifts (tiles are already top-aligned).\n- **Column 3**: [16, 64, 32, 2] → No shifts (tiles are already top-aligned).\n\n  Swiping UP results in no merges and minimal shifts. The largest tile (128) stays in the top-left, but zeros remain in the bottom of column 0, which is less useful than zeros on the right.\n\n#### 4. **Swipe DOWN**:\n- **Column 0**: [128, 8, 0, 0] → Shifts down to [0, 0, 128, 8] (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [64, 4, 64, 4] → No shifts (tiles are already bottom-aligned).\n- **Column 2**: [4, 2, 8, 128] → No shifts (tiles are already bottom-aligned).\n- **Column 3**: [16, 64, 32, 2] → No shifts (tiles are already bottom-aligned).\n\n  Swiping DOWN moves the 128 from (0,0) to (2,0) and 8 to (3,0), disrupting the top-left corner. This weakens the position of the largest tile.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwipe LEFT is the best choice. It keeps the largest tile (128) in the top-left corner, shifts zeros to the right (optimal for future tile spawns), and maintains a structure that supports strategic merging of smaller tiles in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

DOWN  \n- **Column 0**: 128, 8, 64, 4 (all distinct, no merges or movement).  \n- **Column 1**: 64, 4, 8, 128 (all distinct, no merges or movement).  \n- **Column 2**: 4, 2, 32, 2 (all distinct, no merges or movement).  \n- **Column 3**: 16, 64, 0, 4 (tiles shift down; 64 (row 1, column 3) moves into the empty row 2, column 3, row 1 becomes 16, row 0 becomes 0).  \n- **Outcome**: 64 (a larger tile) moves into the empty space, improving tile positioning for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping DOWN moves the larger tile (64) into the empty space, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile positioning, and strategic goals (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 64 | 4 | 16  \nRow 1: 8 | 4 | 2 | 16  \nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 32 | 64  \nRow 3: 4 | 128 | 2 | 4  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The grid is **full** (no empty tiles), so valid moves require merging adjacent equal tiles (since there are no empty spaces to shift into otherwise).\n- The largest tiles are 128 (row 0, column 0) and 128 (row 3, column 1). Strategic play involves keeping large tiles in corners (e.g., top-left corner for the 128 in row 0, column 0).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   - All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. Swiping left or right would not merge any tiles, and since the grid is full, no tiles can shift (no empty spaces). Thus, LEFT and RIGHT are **invalid moves**.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - Column 3 (values: 16, 16, 64, 4) has adjacent 16s (row 0 and row 1). Swiping up merges these 16s into 32 (score +32).  \n   - After merging, the column becomes [32, 64, 4, 0] (row 3, column 3 becomes empty). This places the new 32 in the top row (row 0, column 3), adjacent to the top-left corner (128 in row 0, column 0), supporting a corner-based strategy.  \n   - The empty space (row 3, column 3) is in a corner, minimizing disruption to larger tiles.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 3 (values: 16, 16, 64, 4) could merge 16s if they shift down. However, the 16s are initially in row 0 and row 1, and swiping down would require them to shift past 64 and 4, resulting in merging at row 2 and row 3. This places the new 32 in the bottom row (row 3, column 3), which is less aligned with the top-left corner strategy.  \n   - The empty spaces created (row 0, column 3 and row 3, column 3) are less strategic for maintaining large tiles in a corner.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the optimal move. It merges the 16s in column 3, generates score, and positions the new 32 in the top row (supporting the top-left corner strategy). LEFT and RIGHT are invalid, and DOWN is less strategic for tile positioning.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for possible merges in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to identify the direction that allows the most strategic merging of tiles to maximize the score.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 64 | 4 | 32  \nRow 1: 8 | 4 | 2 | 64  \nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 32 | 4  \nRow 3: 4 | 128 | 2 | 64  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n#### LEFT:\n- All rows have distinct adjacent tiles (no duplicates). No merges occur.  \n  **Result:** No score gain.  \n\n#### RIGHT:\n- All rows have distinct adjacent tiles (no duplicates). No merges occur.  \n  **Result:** No score gain.  \n\n#### UP:\n- Columns are processed top-to-bottom.  \n  - Column 0: [128, 8, 64, 4] (all distinct).  \n  - Column 1: [64, 4, 8, 128] (all distinct).  \n  - Column 2: [4, 2, 32, 2] (2s are separated by 32, so no merge).  \n  - Column 3: [32, 64, 4, 64] (64s are separated by 4, so no merge).  \n  **Result:** No merges.  \n\n#### DOWN:\n- Columns are processed bottom-to-top.  \n  - **Column 2:** [4, 2, 32, 2]  \n    - The 2s in Row 1 and Row 3 are now adjacent after shifting down. They merge into 4. Score gain: 4.  \n  - **Column 3:** [32, 64, 4, 64]  \n    - The 64s in Row 1 and Row 3 are now adjacent after shifting down. They merge into 128. Score gain: 128.  \n  **Result:** Two merges (2+2=4 and 64+64=128), total score gain: 132.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the only direction with valid merges, providing the highest score gain.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for valid moves (merging adjacent tiles or shifting into empty spaces).

All rows have distinct values with no empty spaces, so no merging or shifting occurs. Both moves are invalid.\n\n2. **UP\/DOWN**: For vertical moves (UP\/DOWN), each column is checked. All columns have distinct values with no empty spaces. Even after reversing columns (to simulate DOWN as a left move), no adjacent equal tiles are found to merge. Thus, no merging or shifting occurs.

No merges possible.  \n\n### Evaluating Moves:\nSince the grid is full (no empty tiles) and no adjacent tiles have the same number, **no merges are possible in any direction**. By the rules, a valid move requires either merges or empty spaces to shift tiles. With no empty spaces and no merges, all moves are technically invalid. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.

However, vertical checks reveal two critical pairs:\n   - Column 3: `2` (row 2) and `2` (row 4) (separated by `32` in row 3).\n   - Column 4: `64` (row 2) and `64` (row 4) (separated by `4` in row 3).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Rows have no adjacent equal tiles, so no merges occur. Tiles cannot shift (grid is full), making these invalid.\n- **UP**: Columns have no adjacent equal tiles after shifting up. No merges, so invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Columns are processed to shift tiles downward. For column 4:\n  - Original column 4: `32` (row 1), `64` (row 2), `4` (row 3), `64` (row 4).\n  - When swiping down, `64` (row 2) shifts past `4` (row 3) to row 3, pushing `4` (row 3) up to row 2.

Swiping left or right would not cause any merges (no adjacent equal tiles), so these moves are invalid.\n\n2. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 3 (values: 32, 64, 4, 64): The two 64s (row 1 and row 3) can merge when shifted up. After merging, the column becomes [32, 128, 4, 0], adding 128 to the score.  \n   - Other columns have no merges. Only one valid merge occurs.\n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 3 (values: 32, 64, 4, 64): The two 64s (row 1 and row 3) merge when shifted down. After merging, the column becomes [0, 32, 4, 128], adding 128 to the score.  \n   - Column 2 (values: 4, 2, 32, 2): The two 2s (row 1 and row 3) merge when shifted down. After merging, the column becomes [0, 4, 32, 4], adding 4 to the score.  \n   - Two valid merges occur, yielding more score than the UP swipe.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nMerging larger tiles (like 64s into 128) in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3) aligns with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in a corner.

Since the grid is full, tiles cannot shift left (already packed). **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   Each row is processed rightward. All tiles in every row are distinct (no adjacent equal tiles), so no merging occurs. Since the grid is full, tiles cannot shift right (already packed). **Invalid move**.\n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   Each column is processed upward.

Tiles cannot shift right (no empty spaces), so no merges or movement occur.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   All columns are filled with distinct numbers (no two adjacent tiles are the same).

Swiping left or right would not shift or merge any tiles, as there are no adjacent equal values or empty spaces to fill.  \n2. **UP\/DOWN**: All columns are fully occupied with distinct values. Swiping up or down would not shift or merge any tiles, as there are no adjacent equal values (e.g., 2s in column 2 are separated by 32, and 64s in column 3 are separated by 4) and no empty spaces to fill.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThere are no valid moves, as the grid is full and no adjacent tiles have equal values.

Swiping left or right would not cause any merges, as tiles cannot shift into empty spaces (grid is full). Thus, LEFT\/RIGHT have no valid merges.  \n\n2. **UP\/DOWN**:  \n   All columns are checked for adjacent duplicates. Columns 0, 1, and 3 have distinct numbers. Column 2 has two 2s (at row1 and row3), but they are separated by a 32 (row2), so they are not adjacent. Column 3 has two 64s (at row1 and row3), but they are separated by a 4 (row2), also non-adjacent. Thus, UP\/DOWN also have no valid merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent tiles of the same number. By the rules, a valid move requires either adjacent duplicates to merge or empty spaces to shift into. Since neither condition is met, all moves are invalid.

Thus, there are no valid moves under the rules. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and assuming the game continues (epoch 88 < 100), the most neutral choice (with no immediate negative impact) is selected.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential for merging tiles in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). Merging tiles increases the score, so we prioritize moves that enable the most merges.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 128 | 64 | 4 | 32  \nRow 1: 8 | 4 | 2 | 64  \nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 32 | 4  \nRow 3: 4 | 128 | 2 | 64  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**:  \nEach row is processed left-to-right.

All tiles in every row are distinct (no adjacent equal tiles). No merges occur.  \n\n#### **UP**:  \nEach column is processed top-to-bottom. All tiles in every column are distinct (no adjacent equal tiles). No merges occur.  \n\n#### **DOWN**:  \nEach column is processed bottom-to-top. This direction enables merges in two columns:  \n- **Column 2** (values: 4, 2, 32, 2):  \n  When swiping down, the two 2s (row 1 and row 3) shift downward and become adjacent. They merge into a 4, adding 4 to the score.  \n- **Column 3** (values: 32, 64, 4, 64):  \n  When swiping down, the two 64s (row 1 and row 3) shift downward and become adjacent. They merge into a 128, adding 128 to the score.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe **DOWN** direction is the only move that triggers merges (two merges total: 2+2=4 and 64+64=128), maximizing the score.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into.

Adjacent equal tiles merge left-to-right. The first two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), leaving [4, 2] with zeros filling the remaining spaces.  \n   - Resulting Row 0: [4, 2, 0, 0].  \n   - Strategic Value: The merged 4 is placed in the top-left corner (a corner position, ideal for future merges). Empty spaces remain for new tiles, supporting flexibility in subsequent moves.  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - For Row 0: The tiles [2, 0, 2, 2] shift right, removing zeros to [2, 2, 2]. Adjacent equal tiles merge right-to-left. The last two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), leaving [0, 2, 4, 0].  \n   - Resulting Row 0: [0, 2, 4, 0].  \n   - Strategic Value: The merged 4 is placed in the middle (position 0,2), not a corner. This is less optimal for consolidating large tiles.  \n\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are vertical. All non-zero tiles are in Row 0, so shifting up leaves the board unchanged (no merges or movement). No score gain, and only a new tile is added. Poor strategic value.  \n\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns shift down, moving the 2s in Row 0 to Row 3.

This move scatters tiles downward, reducing consolidation.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe is optimal. It merges two 2s into a 4 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), gains score, and leaves empty spaces for future tiles.

Swipe LEFT  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left → 4|2|0|0 (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left → 2|0|0|0 (no merges).  \n- Result: No merges occur. Tiles are scattered, with no adjacent equal tiles to enable future merges.  \n\n\n### 2. Swipe RIGHT  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right → 0|0|4|2 (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right → 0|0|0|2 (no merges).  \n- Result: No merges occur. Tiles are pushed to the right edge, but no adjacent equal tiles are created for future merges.  \n\n\n### 3. Swipe UP  \n- **Column 0**: [4,0,0,0] → shifts up → 4|0|0|0.  \n- **Column 1**: [2,0,0,0] → shifts up → 2|0|0|0.  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,2] → shifts up → 2|0|0|0 (the 2 from Row 3, Column 2 moves to Row 0, Column 2).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,0] → remains 0|0|0|0.  \n- Resulting Board:  \n  Row 0: 4|2|2|0  \n  Rows 1-3: All 0s.  \n- Key Observation: After shifting up, Row 0 has two adjacent 2s (Columns 1 and 2). This sets up a future LEFT swipe to merge these 2s into a 4, which is strategic for scoring.  \n\n\n### 4. Swipe DOWN  \n- **Column 0**: [4,0,0,0] → shifts down → 0|0|0|4 (4 moves to Row 3, Column 0).  \n- **Column 1**: [2,0,0,0] → shifts down → 0|0|0|2 (2 moves to Row 3, Column 1).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,2] → shifts down → 0|0|0|2 (2 remains in Row 3, Column 2).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,0] → remains 0|0|0|0.  \n- Resulting Board:  \n  Row 3: 4|2|2|0  \n  Rows 0-2: All 0s.  \n- Key Observation: Row 3 has two adjacent 2s (Columns 1 and 2), similar to the UP swipe. However, the 4 (a larger tile) is moved to the bottom-left corner, which is less ideal for building a corner-focused strategy compared to keeping it in the top-left corner.  \n\n\n### Optimal Move  \nSwipping UP keeps the 4 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and positions two 2s adjacent in Row 0. This setup allows a future LEFT swipe to merge the 2s into a 4, maximizing scoring potential. Swiping DOWN also positions 2s adjacently but moves the 4 to the bottom corner, which is less optimal for long-term strategy. Thus, UP is the best choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 2 | 2 | 0  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 0 | 2 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles [4, 2, 2, 0] shift left. The 2s merge into 4, resulting in [4, 4, 0, 0] (score +4).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [0, 2, 0, 0] shift left to [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  ```\n  4|4|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  2|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  ```  \n  Tiles are spread across rows 0 and 2, limiting future merges.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles [4, 2, 2, 0] shift right. The 2s merge into 4, resulting in [0, 4, 4, 0] (score +4).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [0, 2, 0, 0] shift right to [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merge).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  ```\n  0|4|4|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|2  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  ```  \n  Tiles are centered in row 0 and row 3, reducing corner consolidation.\n\n### UP Move:\n- **Column 0**: [4, 0, 0, 0] shifts up (no merge).  \n- **Column 1**: [2, 0, 2, 0] shifts up. The 2s (row 0 and row 2) merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in [4, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 2**: [2, 0, 0, 0] shifts up (no merge).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  ```\n  4|4|2|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  ```  \n  All non-zero tiles are consolidated in the top row, maximizing future merge potential (e.g., 4+4 in row 0 with a subsequent LEFT move).\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- **Column 0**: [4, 0, 0, 0] shifts down to [0, 0, 0, 4].  \n- **Column 1**: [2, 0, 2, 0] shifts down. The 2s (row 0 and row 2) merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in [0, 0, 0, 4].  \n- **Column 2**: [2, 0, 0, 0] shifts down to [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n- Resulting board:  \n  ```\n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  4|4|2|0  \n  ```  \n  Tiles are in the bottom row, which is less strategic than consolidating in the top row for corner-based merging.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP move consolidates tiles in the top row, creating opportunities for future merges (e.g., 4+4 in row 0). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner for better control.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging rules.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\n4|4|2|2\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n```\nOnly the first row has tiles; the rest are empty. We need to check which direction allows merging tiles to maximize scores and strategic positioning.\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- Swiping left shifts all tiles in the first row to the left. \n- The first two tiles (4 and 4) merge into 8 (score +8). \n- The next two tiles (2 and 2) merge into 4 (score +4). \n- Resulting first row: `8|4|0|0`. \n- Empty spaces (positions 3 and 4) will later spawn a new 2 or 4. \n- Merging two pairs of tiles (4s and 2s) maximizes immediate score.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- Swiping right shifts all tiles in the first row to the right. \n- The last two tiles (2 and 2) merge into 4 (score +4). \n- The first two tiles (4 and 4) merge into 8 (score +8). \n- Resulting first row: `0|0|8|4`. \n- Empty spaces (positions 1 and 2) will later spawn a new 2 or 4. \n- Merging the same pairs (4s and 2s) as LEFT, with the same total score.\n\n### UP Move:\n- Swiping up shifts tiles upward. Since all tiles are already in the top row, no merging occurs. The board remains unchanged except for a new tile spawning in an empty space. No score is gained.\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- Swiping down shifts tiles downward. All tiles move to the bottom row, but no merging occurs (tiles are in separate rows). The board becomes:\n  ```\n  0|0|0|0\n  0|0|0|0\n  0|0|0|0\n  4|4|2|2\n  ```\n  No score is gained.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge two pairs of tiles, yielding the same score. However, keeping larger tiles in a corner (a common strategy) favors LEFT, as merging 4s into 8 in the top-left corner provides a stable base for future moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals of merging tiles and keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8|4|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|4|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: `8|4|0|0` (no merges, tiles shift left but remain as 8,4,0,0).  \n   - Row 1: `0|0|4|0` → shifts left to `4|0|0|0`.  \n   - Rows 2-3: Remain all 0s.  \n   - Result: No merges occur, and the 8 (largest tile) stays in the top-left, but no immediate merging opportunities for the 4s.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: `8|4|0|0` → shifts right to `0|0|8|4`.  \n   - Row 1: `0|0|4|0` → shifts right to `0|0|0|4`.  \n   - Rows 2-3: Remain all 0s.  \n   - Result: The 8 moves to row 0, column 2 (not a corner), and the 4s are in separate rows\/columns with no immediate merging potential.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom:  \n     - Column 0: `8,0,0,0` → stays `8,0,0,0`.  \n     - Column 1: `4,0,0,0` → stays `4,0,0,0`.  \n     - Column 2: `0,4,0,0` → shifts up to `4,0,0,0`.  \n     - Column 3: All 0s.  \n   - Resulting board after UP:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 8|4|4|0  \n     Rows 1-3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - The 8 (largest tile) remains in the top-left corner (a strategic corner). The 4s in row 0, columns 1-2 are adjacent, creating an immediate merging opportunity (e.g., a subsequent LEFT move would merge them into 8, earning 8 points).  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom to top:  \n     - Column 0: `8,0,0,0` → shifts down to `0,0,0,8`.  \n     - Column 1: `4,0,0,0` → shifts down to `0,0,0,4`.  \n     - Column 2: `0,4,0,0` → shifts down to `0,0,0,4`.  \n     - Column 3: All 0s.  \n   - Resulting board after DOWN:  \n     ```\n     Rows 0-2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 8|4|4|0  \n     ```  \n   - The 8 moves to the bottom-left corner, and the 4s in row 3, columns 1-2 are adjacent. However, the top-left corner (traditionally a strong position for building larger tiles) is left empty, making this less optimal than UP.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP keeps the largest tile (8) in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and positions two 4s adjacently in row 0, enabling a future merge (e.g., with a LEFT move). This aligns with the goal of combining tiles strategically and maintaining larger tiles in corners. \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile placement. The current board is:\n\nRow 0: 8|4|4|4  \nRows 1-3: All zeros.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   When moving left, tiles in row 0 shift to the left. The row [8,4,4,4] is processed as follows:  \n   - The 8 (position 0) stays.  \n   - The 4 (position 1) and 4 (position 2) merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in [8,8,4,0].  \n   This merges two 4s into an 8 and positions the 8s on the left, which can potentially merge again in future moves (e.g., another left swipe could merge the two 8s into 16).  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   When moving right, tiles in row 0 shift to the right. The row [8,4,4,4] is processed as follows:  \n   - The 4 (position 2) and 4 (position 3) merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in [8,4,0,8].  \n   This also merges two 4s into an 8, but the 8s are now on the far left and right (positions 0 and 3), making future merges less likely compared to LEFT.  \n\n3. **UP\/DOWN**:  \n   - **UP**: Tiles in row 0 (the top row) cannot move up further, so no merging occurs. The board remains unchanged except for a new tile spawn, which is inefficient.  \n   - **DOWN**: Tiles in row 0 shift to row 3 (the bottom row), but no vertical merging occurs (since all columns have only one tile). This only moves tiles without merging, making it less optimal.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:  \nMerging tiles and positioning larger tiles in a corner (as per the hint) is key. Moving LEFT positions the merged 8s adjacent on the left, enabling potential future merges (e.g., 8+8=16 with another left swipe). This is more strategic than RIGHT, where the 8s are spread out.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|8|4|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **UP**  \nMoving tiles upward: Columns are processed from top to bottom.  \n- Column 0: 8 (row 0), 2 (row 1), 0, 0 → No merging (8 and 2 are different).  \n- Column 1: 8 (row 0), 0, 0, 0 → No movement (8 is already at the top).  \n- Columns 2-3: All zeros.  \nNo tiles merge or shift meaningfully. **UP is not a valid move**.\n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \nMoving tiles downward: Columns are processed from bottom to top.  \n- Column 0: 8 (row 0), 2 (row 1), 0, 0 → 8 moves to row 2, 2 moves to row 3.  \n- Column 1: 8 (row 0), 0, 0, 0 → 8 moves to row 3.  \n- Column 2: 4 (row 0), 0, 0, 0 → 4 moves to row 3.  \n- Column 3: All zeros.  \nNo merging occurs (tiles are distinct). **DOWN does not merge any tiles**.\n\n\n#### **LEFT**  \nMoving tiles left: Rows are processed from left to right.  \n- Row 0: 8,8,4,0 → 8 and 8 merge into 16 (score +16), 4 shifts left. Result: 16|4|0|0.  \n- Row 1: 2,0,0,0 → 2 shifts left (no merge). Result: 2|0|0|0.  \n- Rows 2-3: All zeros.  \nThis move merges the two 8s into 16 (critical for scoring) and positions the 16 in the top-left corner, a strategic corner for larger tiles.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nMoving tiles right: Rows are processed from right to left.  \n- Row 0: 8,8,4,0 → 8 and 8 merge into 16 (score +16), 4 shifts right. Result: 0|0|4|16.  \n- Row 1: 2,0,0,0 → 2 shifts right. Result: 0|0|0|2.  \n- Rows 2-3: All zeros.  \nThis move also merges the two 8s into 16 but positions the 16 in the top-right corner. However, the 4 in row 0, column 2 is less aligned with future merging potential compared to the LEFT move.\n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nBoth LEFT and RIGHT merge the 8s, but LEFT positions the 16 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and leaves the 4 adjacent to the 16, increasing the potential for future merges (e.g., with a new 4). LEFT is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging potential.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\nRow 0: 16|4|0|4  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **UP**: Tiles move upward. However, no tiles can move up because there are no empty spaces above existing tiles (e.g., the 16 in Row 0, Column 0 has no empty space above it, and the 2 in Row 1, Column 0 cannot move up past the 16). This results in no movement, making UP an invalid move.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Tiles move downward. Columns are processed to shift tiles to the bottom:\n   - Column 0: [16, 2, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 16, 2] (no merging).  \n   - Column 1: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merging).  \n   - Column 3: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merging).  \n   This results in no merges and no score, making DOWN less effective.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Tiles move right. For Row 0: [16, 4, 0, 4] → reversed to [4, 0, 4, 16], shifted left to [4, 4, 0, 16], merged to [8, 0, 0, 16], then reversed back to [16, 0, 0, 8]. This merges the two 4s into 8 (score +8). However, the 16 remains in Column 0, and the merged 8 moves to Column 3, spreading larger tiles.\n\n4. **LEFT**: Tiles move left. For Row 0: [16, 4, 0, 4] → shifted left to [16, 4, 4, 0], then merged to [16, 8, 0, 0] (score +8). The 16 and merged 8 stay on the left, keeping larger tiles concentrated in the top-left corner, which aligns with strategic goals (keeping large tiles in a corner for future merges).\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is optimal because it merges the two 4s into an 8 (scoring 8) while keeping the larger tiles (16 and 8) concentrated in the top-left corner, facilitating future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping large tiles in a corner, and setting up future merges). The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 16|8|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|4|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left in each row.  \n   - Row 0: `16|8|0|0` (no merging, as 16 and 8 are distinct).  \n   - Row 1: `2|0|0|0` (no change).  \n   - Row 3: `0|0|4|0` → `4|0|0|0` (4 moves left).  \n   - Result: No merging occurs. The 16 remains in the top-left corner, but the 4 moves to row 3, column 0, which is less strategic for future merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right in each row.  \n   - Row 0: `16|8|0|0` → `0|0|16|8` (no merging).  \n   - Row 1: `2|0|0|0` → `0|0|0|2` (2 moves right).  \n   - Row 3: `0|0|4|0` → `0|0|0|4` (4 moves right).  \n   - Result: No merging. The 16 moves to row 0, column 2, which is not a corner, reducing strategic value.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift upward in each column.  \n   - Column 0: `16, 2, 0, 0` → `16, 2, 0, 0` (no merging).  \n   - Column 1: `8, 0, 0, 0` → `8, 0, 0, 0` (no merging).  \n   - Column 2: `0, 0, 0, 4` → `4, 0, 0, 0` (4 moves up to row 0, column 2).  \n   - Result: No merging, but the 4 moves to row 0, column 2, creating a sequence in the top row: `16|8|4|0`. This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner (16 in top-left) and building a descending sequence (16 → 8 → 4) for future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift downward in each column.  \n   - Column 0: `16, 2, 0, 0` → `0, 0, 16, 2` (16 moves to row 2, column 0; 2 moves to row 3, column 0).  \n   - Column 1: `8, 0, 0, 0` → `0, 0, 0, 8` (8 moves to row 3, column 1).  \n   - Column 2: `0, 0, 0, 4` → `0, 0, 0, 4` (4 stays in row 3, column 2).  \n   - Result: No merging. The 16 moves to row 2, column 0 (not a corner), reducing strategic value.  \n\n### Strategic Choice:\nMoving **UP** is optimal because it keeps the largest tile (16) in the top-left corner and positions the 4 in the top row (row 0, column 2), creating a sequence `16|8|4|0`. This sequence sets up potential future merges (e.g., if a new 4 is added to row 0, column 3, swiping left would merge the two 4s into 8, then the 8s into 16, etc.). This aligns with the goal of building a descending sequence in a corner for higher-scoring merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning (keeping larger tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 8 | 4 | 8\nRow 1: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles (16, 8, 4, 8) are already left-aligned with no adjacent duplicates to merge.  \n   - Row 1: The 2 shifts left to column 0 (no change from current state).  \n   - Rows 2-3: All zeros, no movement.  \n   - Result: No merges, but the largest tile (16) remains in the top-left corner (a strategic corner).  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles (16, 8, 4, 8) shift right but remain in their positions (no adjacent duplicates to merge).  \n   - Row 1: The 2 shifts right to column 3.  \n   - Rows 2-3: All zeros, no movement.  \n   - Result: No merges, and the 16 in row 0, column 0 (top-left corner) is left isolated, reducing strategic positioning.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns 0-3: Tiles in row 0 (16, 8, 4, 8) and row 1 (2) cannot move up further (row 0 is already occupied).  \n   - Result: No movement or merges. The board remains unchanged, which is inefficient.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: 16 (row 0) shifts down to row 2, and 2 (row 1) shifts down to row 3.  \n   - Columns 1-3: 8 (row 0), 4 (row 0), and 8 (row 0) shift down to row 3.  \n   - Result: Row 3 becomes [2, 8, 4, 8], and row 2 has [16, 0, 0, 0]. The 16 (largest tile) moves from the top-left corner to row 2, column 0, weakening strategic positioning.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe best move is **LEFT**, as it keeps the largest tile (16) in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and avoids disrupting the potential for future merges. Other moves either fail to merge tiles, move the largest tile away from the corner, or leave the board unchanged.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging opportunities:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16|8|4|8  \nRow 1: 2|2|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles (16, 8, 4, 8) are all non-zero and distinct, so no merging occurs. They remain as 16|8|4|8.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (2, 2, 0, 0) shift left. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in 4|0|0|0.  \n- Rows 2 and 3: All zeros, no change.  \n\nAfter moving LEFT, the board becomes:  \nRow 0: 16|8|4|8  \nRow 1: 4|0|0|0  \nRows 2-3: 0s.  \n\nThis move merges the 2s in Row 1, adds 4 to the score, and keeps the largest tile (16) in the top-left corner, aligning with the strategy of consolidating larger tiles in a corner.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles (16, 8, 4, 8) are all non-zero and distinct, so no merging occurs. They remain as 16|8|4|8.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (2, 2, 0, 0) shift right. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in 0|0|0|4.  \n- Rows 2 and 3: All zeros, no change.  \n\nAfter moving RIGHT, the board becomes:  \nRow 0: 16|8|4|8  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|4  \nRows 2-3: 0s.  \n\nThis also merges the 2s but places the merged 4 in the top-right corner, which is less aligned with consolidating the largest tile (16) in the top-left corner.\n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are already filled with tiles at the top (no empty spaces above non-zero tiles). Moving UP does not shift or merge any tiles, making it an invalid move.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles in each column shift down, but no merges occur (all non-zero tiles in columns are distinct). The board after moving DOWN would have tiles in the bottom rows, but no immediate score gain. This move does not consolidate tiles effectively.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nLEFT is the best move. It merges the 2s in Row 1, adds score, and keeps the largest tile (16) in the top-left corner, supporting future strategic merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes, focusing on merging tiles and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|8|4|8\nRow 1: 4|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|8\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- Row 0: No zeros, so tiles remain `16|8|4|8`.\n- Row 1: `4|0|0|0` shifts to `4|0|0|0` (no change).\n- Row 2: `0|0|0|8` shifts to `8|0|0|0`.\n- Row 3: No change.  \n**Result**: No merges. Score = 0.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Row 0: No zeros, so tiles remain `16|8|4|8`.\n- Row 1: `4|0|0|0` shifts to `0|0|0|4`.\n- Row 2: `0|0|0|8` remains `0|0|0|8` (already rightmost).\n- Row 3: No change.  \n**Result**: No merges. Score = 0.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Column 0: `16,4,0,0` shifts to `16,4,0,0` (no merge).\n- Column 1: `8,0,0,0` shifts to `8,0,0,0` (no merge).\n- Column 2: `4,0,0,0` shifts to `4,0,0,0` (no merge).\n- Column 3: `8,0,8,0` shifts to `8,8,0,0`, then merges into `16,0,0,0` (score += 16).  \n**Result**: Merged two 8s into 16. Score = 16. Board becomes:\n```\nRow 0: 16|8|4|16\nRow 1: 4|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Column 0: `16,4,0,0` shifts to `0,0,16,4` (no merge).\n- Column 1: `8,0,0,0` shifts to `0,0,0,8` (no merge).\n- Column 2: `4,0,0,0` shifts to `0,0,0,4` (no merge).\n- Column 3: `8,0,8,0` shifts to `0,0,8,8`, then merges into `0,0,0,16` (score += 16).  \n**Result**: Merged two 8s into 16. Score = 16. Board becomes:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|0|0|0\nRow 3: 4|8|4|16\n```\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nBoth UP and DOWN yield a merge (score 16). However, strategic positioning of larger tiles is critical. The DOWN swipe places the merged 16 in the bottom-right corner (a corner), which aligns with the 2048 strategy of keeping large tiles in corners to facilitate future merges. The UP swipe leaves 16s in both the top-left and top-right, which is less optimal for corner consolidation. Thus, DOWN is preferable.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|0|0|0\nRow 3: 4|8|4|16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: `[2,0,0,0]` shifts left to `[2,0,0,0]` (no change).  \n   - Row 1: All zeros, remains `[0,0,0,0]`.  \n   - Row 2: `[16,0,0,0]` shifts left to `[16,0,0,0]` (no change).  \n   - Row 3: `[4,8,4,16]` has no empty spaces, so it remains unchanged.  \n   - No merges occur, and the board structure remains largely the same. This move does not strategically position tiles for future merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: `[2,0,0,0]` shifts right to `[0,0,0,2]` (2 moves to the rightmost column).  \n   - Row 1: All zeros, remains `[0,0,0,0]`.  \n   - Row 2: `[16,0,0,0]` shifts right to `[0,0,0,16]` (16 moves to the rightmost column).  \n   - Row 3: `[4,8,4,16]` has no empty spaces, so it remains unchanged.  \n   - After this move, the 16 in Row 2 (now at Column 3) and the 16 in Row 3 (Column 3) are vertically aligned in the rightmost column. This positions them to potentially merge with a subsequent DOWN move, creating a 32 tile and earning score.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed to shift tiles upward:  \n     - Column 0: `[2,0,16,4]` shifts up to `[2,16,4,0]` (no merges).  \n     - Column 1: `[0,0,0,8]` shifts up to `[8,0,0,0]`.  \n     - Column 2: `[0,0,0,4]` shifts up to `[4,0,0,0]`.  \n     - Column 3: `[0,0,0,16]` shifts up to `[16,0,0,0]`.  \n   - The resulting board spreads larger tiles (2, 8, 4, 16) across Row 0, making it harder to merge them in future moves.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed to shift tiles downward:  \n     - Column 0: `[2,0,16,4]` shifts down to `[0,2,16,4]` (no merges).  \n     - Columns 1-3: Tiles remain in their original positions (no empty spaces to shift into).  \n   - This move does not meaningfully reposition tiles for future merges and leaves larger tiles (16, 4) spread out.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT strategically aligns the two 16 tiles in the rightmost column (Column 3), setting up a potential merge with a subsequent DOWN move. This positions larger tiles in a corner (right column) and creates opportunities for future high-value merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|16  \nRow 3: 4|8|4|16  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- Row 0: [0,0,0,2] → shifts left to [2,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n- Row 1: [0,0,0,0] → no change.  \n- Row 2: [4,0,0,16] → shifts left to [4,16,0,0] (no merges).  \n- Row 3: [4,8,4,16] → no adjacent equal tiles, so no merges.  \n**Result**: No merges, score 0.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- Row 0: [0,0,0,2] → already right-aligned (no change).  \n- Row 1: [0,0,0,0] → no change.  \n- Row 2: [4,0,0,16] → shifts right to [0,0,4,16] (no merges).  \n- Row 3: [4,8,4,16] → no adjacent equal tiles, so no merges.  \n**Result**: No merges, score 0.  \n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- Column 0: [0,0,4,4] → removes zeros → [4,4] → merges to 8 (score +8).  \n- Column 1: [0,0,0,8] → removes zeros → [8] (no merge).  \n- Column 2: [0,0,0,4] → removes zeros → [4] (no merge).  \n- Column 3: [2,0,16,16] → removes zeros → [2,16,16] → merges 16+16 to 32 (score +32).  \n**Result**: Merges 4+4=8 and 16+16=32, total score 40.

No merges occur (all non-zero tiles are distinct). Results in minimal tile rearrangement with no score gain. Not useful.\n\n#### **RIGHT**:\n- Tiles shift right in each row. No merges occur (non-zero tiles remain distinct and do not align). Results in negligible changes. Not useful.\n\n#### **UP**:\n- Tiles shift upward in each column. Key observation: Column 1 has two 16s (rows 1 and 3). When shifting up, these 16s merge into a 32 (score +32). Other columns:\n  - Column 2: 4 (row 3) shifts to row 0.\n  - Column 3: 4 (row 1), 2 (row 2), and 32 (row 3) shift up but remain distinct.\n- Post-merge board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 0|32|4|4\n  Row 1: 0|0|0|2\n  Row 2: 0|0|0|32\n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0\n  ```\n- Advantage: The 4s in row 0 (columns 2 and 3) are adjacent, setting up a future left swipe to merge them into 8 (additional score).\n\n#### **DOWN**:\n- Tiles shift downward in each column. Key observation: Column 1 has two 16s (rows 1 and 3). When shifting down, these 16s merge into a 32 (score +32). Other columns:\n  - Column 2: 4 (row 3) remains at the bottom.\n  - Column 3: 4 (row 1), 2 (row 2), and 32 (row 3) shift down but remain distinct.\n- Post-merge board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 0|0|0|0\n  Row 1: 0|0|0|4\n  Row 2: 0|0|0|2\n  Row 3: 0|32|4|32\n  ```\n- Disadvantage: The 32s in row 3 (columns 1 and 3) are not adjacent, limiting future merge potential.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is superior because it merges the 16s into a 32 (score +32) and positions 4s adjacently in row 0, enabling a future merge. DOWN also merges the 16s but leaves 32s non-adjacent, reducing future opportunities.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

The two 4s merge into 8, resulting in [32, 8, 0, 0]. Score: +8.\n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 0, 2] shifts left to [2, 0, 0, 0]. No merge.\n- **Row 2**: [0, 0, 16, 32] shifts left to [16, 32, 0, 0]. No merge.\n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 0, 0] remains unchanged.  \n**Result**: Merges 4s into 8, scores 8, and aligns larger tiles (32, 8, 2, 16, 32) on the left edge, which is strategic for future merges.\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: [0, 32, 4, 4] shifts right to [0, 32, 4, 4]. The two 4s merge into 8, resulting in [0, 32, 8, 0]. Score: +8.\n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 0, 2] shifts right to [0, 0, 0, 2]. No merge.\n- **Row 2**: [0, 0, 16, 32] shifts right to [0, 0, 16, 32]. No merge.\n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 0, 0] remains unchanged.  \n**Result**: Merges 4s into 8 but leaves larger tiles (32, 8) in the middle, which is less strategic than aligning them on the edge.\n\n#### **UP Move**:\n- Columns are processed vertically, but no tiles merge (all adjacent tiles are distinct or separated by zeros). No score, and no meaningful tile alignment.\n\n#### **DOWN Move**:\n- Columns are processed vertically, but no tiles merge (all adjacent tiles are distinct or separated by zeros). No score, and no meaningful tile alignment.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT move is optimal because it merges the 4s in Row 0 (scoring 8) and aligns larger tiles (32, 8, 2, 16, 32) on the left edge, which is a strategic position for future merges. RIGHT also merges the 4s but leaves tiles less optimally positioned. UP and DOWN do not merge any tiles.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|8|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 16|32|8|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles in each row are already shifted left with no empty spaces to fill or merges possible (e.g., row 0: `32|8|0|0` remains unchanged). No tiles move, so this is an invalid move.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but this scatters the larger tiles (32, 16) across the grid. For example:  \n   - Row 0 becomes `0|0|32|8`  \n   - Row 1 becomes `0|0|0|2`  \n   - Row 2 becomes `0|16|32|8`  \n   This spreads tiles and reduces the potential for merging in subsequent moves.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down, but larger tiles (32, 16) end up in lower rows (e.g., row 3: `16|32|8|0`). This makes it harder to merge them with adjacent tiles, as they are spread vertically with no immediate merging opportunities.\n\n4. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward, consolidating smaller tiles and creating merging opportunities:  \n   - Column 0 (32, 2, 16, 0) shifts up to `32|2|16|0` (no merges).  \n   - Column 1 (8, 0, 32, 0) shifts up to `8|32|0|0` (no merges).  \n   - Column 2 (0, 0, 8, 0) shifts up to `8|0|0|0` (no merges).  \n   - Column 3 remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n\n   After the UP move, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 32|8|8|0  \n   Row 1: 2|32|0|0  \n   Row 2: 16|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n\n   Notably, row 0 now has two adjacent 8s (`8|8`). This sets up a future LEFT move to merge them into 16, increasing the score. Additionally, the largest tile (32) remains in the top-left corner, a strategic position to keep larger tiles grouped for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP move consolidates tiles, creates merging opportunities, and maintains larger tiles in a corner, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcome of each possible swipe (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\nRow 0: 32 | 8 | 8 | 8  \nRow 1: 2 | 32 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: [32, 8, 8, 8] → Tiles shift left.

Result: `8|4|0|0`.  \n   - Column 3: All zeros, no change.  \n   - Larger tiles are scattered vertically, with no clear corner clustering.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: Tiles `32|2|16|0` shift down to `0|32|2|16` (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: Tiles `16|32|0|0` shift down to `0|0|16|32` (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: Tiles `8|4|0|0` shift down to `0|0|8|4` (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: All zeros, no change.  \n   - Larger tiles are spread downward, reducing strategic clustering.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile no direction immediately triggers merges, **LEFT** is optimal because it keeps larger tiles (32, 16, 8, 32, 16) clustered on the left, aligning with the strategy of cornering large tiles for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, potential merges, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 8 | 0\nRow 1: 2 | 32 | 4 | 0\nRow 2: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 0 | 4 | 0 | 0\n```\nKey observations:\n- No adjacent equal tiles in rows or columns (no immediate merges possible).\n- The largest tiles are 32 (at (0,0) and (1,1)) and 16 (at (2,0)).\n- Empty tiles (zeros) are spread across the grid, so all directions are valid moves (tiles can shift into empty spaces).\n\n### Evaluation of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. Row 3's 4 (column 1) moves to column 0, but no other changes. No strategic benefit for future merges.\n   \n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right, but no merges occur. Tiles spread out, moving larger tiles (e.g., 32, 16) away from corners. Less favorable for consolidating larger tiles.\n   \n3. **UP**: Tiles shift up, but no merges occur. Larger tiles (32, 16) remain in the upper half, but no meaningful grouping of smaller tiles for future merges.\n   \n4. **DOWN**: Tiles shift down, and while no vertical merges occur immediately, this move strategically positions smaller tiles for future horizontal merges. Specifically:\n   - The 4 in row 1, column 2 moves down to row 3, column 2.\n   - The 4 in row 3, column 1 stays in row 3, column 1.\n   - After moving down, row 3 becomes `16 | 4 | 4 | 0`, with two adjacent 4s in columns 1 and 2. These 4s can merge horizontally in a subsequent LEFT move, creating an 8 and contributing to higher scores.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nMoving DOWN positions two 4s adjacently in row 3, setting up a potential merge in the next move (e.g., LEFT). This aligns with the strategy of grouping smaller tiles to facilitate future merges and consolidate larger tiles.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the resulting board states, focusing on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 8 | 0\nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 2 | 32 | 8 | 0\nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 4 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: [0, 0, 8, 0] → Shifts to [8, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).\n- **Row 1**: [32, 16, 0, 0] → Shifts to [32, 16, 0, 0] (no merge).\n- **Row 2**: [2, 32, 8, 0] → Shifts to [2, 32, 8, 0] (no merge).\n- **Row 3**: [16, 4, 4, 0] → Shifts and merges 4s into 8 → [16, 8, 0, 0] (score +8).  \n**Result**: Limited merging (only 1 merge for 8 points).\n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: [0, 0, 8, 0] → Shifts to [0, 0, 0, 8] (no merge).\n- **Row 1**: [32, 16, 0, 0] → Shifts to [0, 0, 32, 16] (no merge).\n- **Row 2**: [2, 32, 8, 0] → Shifts to [0, 2, 32, 8] (no merge).\n- **Row 3**: [16, 4, 4, 0] → Shifts and merges 4s into 8 → [0, 16, 0, 8] (score +8).  \n**Result**: Same merging as LEFT (only 1 merge for 8 points).\n\n#### 3. UP:\nColumns are processed to shift tiles upward, merging adjacent equal values:\n- **Column 0**: [0, 32, 2, 16] → Shifts to [32, 2, 16, 0] (no merge).\n- **Column 1**: [0, 16, 32, 4] → Shifts to [16, 32, 4, 0] (no merge).\n- **Column 2**: [8, 0, 8, 4] → Shifts to [8, 8, 4, 0], then merges 8s into 16 → [16, 4, 0, 0] (score +16).\n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 0, 0] → No change.  \n**Result**: Merges two 8s into 16 (score +16). Larger tiles (32, 16) are positioned in the top row, supporting a corner strategy.\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\nColumns are processed to shift tiles downward, merging adjacent equal values:\n- **Column 0**: [0, 32, 2, 16] → Shifts to [0, 32, 2, 16] (no merge).\n- **Column 1**: [0, 16, 32, 4] → Shifts to [0, 16, 32, 4] (no merge).\n- **Column 2**: [8, 0, 8, 4] → Shifts to [0, 8, 8, 4], then merges 8s into 16 → [0, 16, 4, 0] (score +16).\n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 0, 0] → No change.  \n**Result**: Merges two 8s into 16 (score +16), but larger tiles (32, 16) are in the second row, less optimal for corner strategy.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP and DOWN both merge two 8s for 16 points, but UP positions larger tiles (32, 16) in the top row, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner. Thus, UP is the best move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, maximizing score, and positioning larger tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 16 | 0\nRow 1: 2  | 32 | 4  | 0\nRow 2: 16 | 4  | 16 | 0\nRow 3: 0  | 0  | 0  | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two `16`s merge into `32` (score +32). Result: `32 | 32 | 0 | 0`.  \n   - **Row 1**: No merges; tiles shift left. Result: `2 | 32 | 4 | 0`.  \n   - **Row 2**: No merges; tiles shift left. Result: `16 | 4 | 16 | 0`.  \n   - **Row 3**: No change (all zeros).  \n   - **Outcome**: Merges `16+16=32` in Row 0, creating adjacent `32`s in Row 0 (positions 0 and 1), which can merge into `64` in a subsequent LEFT move. This aligns with keeping larger tiles in a corner (top-left).\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two `16`s merge into `32` (score +32). Result: `0 | 0 | 32 | 32`.  \n   - **Row 1**: No merges; tiles shift right. Result: `0 | 2 | 32 | 4`.  \n   - **Row 2**: No merges; tiles shift right. Result: `0 | 16 | 4 | 16`.  \n   - **Row 3**: No change (all zeros).  \n   - **Outcome**: Merges `16+16=32` in Row 0, creating adjacent `32`s in Row 0 (positions 2 and 3). While this also allows future merging, the `32`s are in the top-right, which is less strategic than the top-left corner.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom. No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, so no merges occur. Tiles shift up but remain unmerged. No score gain.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom to top. No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, so no merges occur. Tiles shift down but remain unmerged. No score gain.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge `16+16=32` (score +32). However, LEFT positions the merged `32`s in the top-left (Row 0, positions 0 and 1), setting up for a future merge into `64` in the top-left corner—a strategic advantage. RIGHT positions the merged `32`s in the top-right, which is less optimal. UP and DOWN provide no merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN), focusing on merging opportunities, tile positioning, and future move potential.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|32|0|0\nRow 1: 2|32|4|0\nRow 2: 16|4|16|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: 32 and 32 merge into 64 (score +64). Row becomes `64|0|0|0`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left to `2|32|4|0` (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left to `16|4|16|0` (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left to `4|0|0|0` (no merges).  \n- Result: 64 in the top-left corner, but no immediate future merges for smaller tiles.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: 32 and 32 shift right and merge into 64 (score +64). Row becomes `0|0|0|64`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right to `0|2|32|4` (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right to `0|16|4|16` (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles remain `0|0|0|4` (no merges).  \n- Result: 64 in the top-right corner, but no immediate future merges for smaller tiles.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift up to `32|2|16|0` (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: 32 (Row 0) and 32 (Row 1) merge into 64 (score +64). Column becomes `64|4|0|0`.  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles shift up to `4|16|0|0` (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: 4 (Row 3) shifts up to `4|0|0|0` (no merges).  \n- Resulting Board:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 32|64|4|4  \n  Row 1: 2|4|16|0  \n  Row 2: 16|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n  ```  \n- Key Advantage: Row 0 now has adjacent 4s (columns 2 and 3), which can merge into 8 with a subsequent LEFT swipe (additional score +8).  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift down to `0|32|2|16` (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: 32 (Row 0) and 32 (Row 1) shift down and merge into 64 (score +64). Column becomes `0|0|64|4`.  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles shift down to `0|0|4|16` (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles remain `0|0|0|4` (no merges).  \n- Result: 64 in Row 2, Column 1 (not a corner), with no immediate future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe UP swipe merges the 32s into 64 (score +64) and positions two 4s adjacently in Row 0, enabling a future merge (4+4→8). This creates better opportunities for subsequent moves compared to LEFT\/RIGHT (which only place 64 in a corner without immediate follow-up merges) or DOWN (which leaves 64 in a non-corner position).  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|64|4|4  \nRow 1: 2|4|16|0  \nRow 2: 16|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|4|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8). New row: `32|64|8|0`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left (no merges). New row: `2|4|16|0`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left (no merges). New row: `16|0|0|0`.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left (no merges). New row: `4|0|0|0`.  \n- **Outcome**: Score +8. Larger tiles (32, 64) stay in the top row, but limited future merge potential.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8). New row: `32|64|0|8`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right (no merges). New row: `0|2|4|16`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right (no merges). New row: `0|0|0|16`.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right (no merges). New row: `0|0|0|4`.  \n- **Outcome**: Score +8. Notably, 16s align vertically in Column 3 (Row 1: 16, Row 2: 16). This sets up a future UP move to merge them into 32 (score +32), which is a strong strategic advantage.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed top to bottom. No merges occur because all non-zero tiles in columns are distinct.  \n- **Outcome**: No score gain. Poor for immediate and future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed bottom to top. No merges occur because non-zero tiles in columns are distinct.  \n- **Outcome**: No score gain. No meaningful setup for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield +8 score immediately, but RIGHT strategically positions two 16s vertically in Column 3, enabling a high-value merge (32) on the next UP move. This makes RIGHT the better choice.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging rules:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|32|64|8\nRow 1: 0|2|4|16\nRow 2: 8|0|0|16\nRow 3: 0|0|0|4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left in each row, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   32|64|8|0  \n   2|4|16|0  \n   8|16|0|0  \n   4|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   No score gain.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right in each row, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). The board remains nearly unchanged:  \n   ```\n   0|32|64|8  \n   0|2|4|16  \n   0|0|8|16  \n   0|0|0|4  \n   ```  \n   No score gain.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward in each column. In **Column 3** (values: 8, 16, 16, 4), the two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). The merged column becomes [8, 32, 4, 0]. Other columns shift without merging. The resulting board is:  \n   ```\n   8|32|64|8  \n   0|2|4|32  \n   0|0|0|4  \n   0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   Score gain: 32.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward in each column. In **Column 3** (values: 8, 16, 16, 4), the two 16s could merge into 32, but the merged tile would be placed lower, leaving fewer empty spaces. Other columns shift without meaningful merges. The resulting board has scattered tiles and fewer empty rows compared to UP.  \n   Score gain: 32 (same as UP, but less strategic).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP move provides a clear score gain (32) and consolidates larger tiles (32, 64) in the top rows, leaving empty space in the bottom rows for future moves. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize future merging potential and strategically position tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|32|64|8\nRow 1: 0|2|4|32\nRow 2: 0|0|0|4\nRow 3: 0|0|2|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles (8, 32, 64, 8) have no adjacent duplicates, so they stay as-is.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (0, 2, 4, 32) shift left to (2, 4, 32, 0).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (0, 0, 0, 4) shift left to (4, 0, 0, 0).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles (0, 0, 2, 0) shift left to (2, 0, 0, 0).  \n- **Result**: No merges occur. The board remains fragmented with no clear path for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles (8, 32, 64, 8) have no adjacent duplicates and no zeros to shift into, so they stay as-is.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (0, 2, 4, 32) shift right but remain (0, 2, 4, 32) (no zeros to fill).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (0, 0, 0, 4) shift right but remain (0, 0, 0, 4).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles (0, 0, 2, 0) shift right to (0, 0, 0, 2).  \n- **Result**: Minimal changes; no merges or strategic positioning.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles (8, 0, 0, 0) shift up to (8, 0, 0, 0).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (32, 2, 0, 0) shift up to (32, 2, 0, 0).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles (64, 4, 0, 2) shift up to (64, 4, 2, 0).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles (8, 32, 4, 0) shift up to (8, 32, 4, 0).  \n- **Result**: No merges. Larger tiles (64, 32, 8) remain spread out, limiting future merging opportunities.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles (8, 0, 0, 0) shift down to (0, 0, 0, 8).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (32, 2, 0, 0) shift down to (0, 0, 32, 2).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles (64, 4, 0, 2) shift down to (0, 64, 4, 2).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles (8, 32, 4, 0) shift down to (0, 8, 32, 4).  \n- **Result**: The board becomes:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 1: 0|0|64|8  \n  Row 2: 0|32|4|32  \n  Row 3: 8|2|2|4  \n  ```  \n  - **Key Observation**: The two 2s in Row 3 (columns 1 and 2) become adjacent. This positions them for a potential merge in the next move (e.g., swiping LEFT), which would create a 4 and increase the score.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nSwiping DOWN consolidates smaller tiles (e.g., the 2s in Row 3) into adjacent positions, creating future merging opportunities. This aligns with the strategy of grouping smaller tiles to build larger ones, while keeping larger tiles (64, 32) in positions that allow for controlled progression.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the merges and resulting scores.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|32|0\nRow 1: 0|0|64|8\nRow 2: 0|32|4|32\nRow 3: 8|2|2|4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,32,0] → Shifts to [32,0,0,0] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [0,0,64,8] → Shifts to [64,8,0,0] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [0,32,4,32] → Shifts to [32,4,32,0] (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: [8,2,2,4] → Shifts to [8,4,4,0] (merges 2+2 into 4, score +4).\n- **Total Score**: 4.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,32,0] → Shifts to [0,0,0,32] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [0,0,64,8] → Shifts to [0,0,64,8] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [0,32,4,32] → Shifts to [0,4,32,32] → Merges 32+32 into 64 (score +64).\n- **Row 3**: [8,2,2,4] → Shifts to [8,0,4,4] (merges 2+2 into 4, score +4).\n- **Total Score**: 64 + 4 = 68.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed by shifting tiles upward.

The first two `8`s merge into `16` (score +16), leaving `[16, 8, 0, 0]`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `[0, 2, 0, 32]` shift left to `[2, 32, 0, 0]` (no merging).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `[0, 0, 0, 4]` shift left to `[4, 0, 0, 0]` (no merging).  \n- **Result**: Merges only in Row 1 (score +16). Large tiles (64, 32s) remain spread across Row 0, with smaller tiles in the left column.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles `[4, 32, 64, 32]` have no adjacent duplicates, so no merging.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `[0, 8, 8, 8]` shift right. The last two `8`s merge into `16` (score +16), leaving `[0, 0, 8, 16]`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `[0, 2, 0, 32]` shift right to `[0, 0, 2, 32]` (no merging).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `[0, 0, 0, 4]` remain unchanged (no merging).  \n- **Result**: Merges only in Row 1 (score +16). The merged `16` in Row 1, Column 3 (rightmost column) aligns with the 64 in Row 0, Column 2, supporting a strategy of consolidating large tiles in the top-right corner.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are checked for upward shifts. All columns either have no adjacent duplicates or no empty spaces to shift tiles into. No merges or tile movements occur.  \n- **Result**: Invalid move (no tiles shift or merge).  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are checked for downward shifts. Tiles shift to the bottom but no adjacent duplicates exist to merge.  \n- **Result**: No merges (score +0). Large tiles remain scattered, with no strategic consolidation.  \n\n\n### Strategic Choice  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 16 points, but RIGHT is preferable. It consolidates the merged `16` in the rightmost column (Row 1, Column 3), aligning with the 64 in Row 0, Column 2. This supports a long-term strategy of building larger tiles in the top-right corner, facilitating future merges (e.g., potential 32s or 64s in the right column).  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 32 | 64 | 32\nRow 1: 0 | 4 | 8 | 16\nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 2 | 32\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 4\n```\nThe largest tile is 64 in row 0, column 2. The goal is to align tiles for future merges and keep larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles [4, 32, 64, 32] do not merge (no adjacent duplicates).  \n   - Row 1: [0, 4, 8, 16] shifts left to [4, 8, 16, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [0, 0, 2, 32] shifts left to [2, 32, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [0, 0, 0, 4] shifts left to [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - **Result**: No merges, minimal tile movement.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [4, 32, 64, 32] does not shift (no empty spaces to the right of non-zero tiles).  \n   - Row 1: [0, 4, 8, 16] does not shift (16 is already rightmost).  \n   - Row 2: [0, 0, 2, 32] does not shift (32 is already rightmost).  \n   - Row 3: [0, 0, 0, 4] does not shift (4 is already rightmost).  \n   - **Result**: No movement or merges.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns 0-2: Tiles are already shifted up (no empty spaces above non-zero tiles).  \n   - Column 3: [32, 16, 32, 4] has no adjacent duplicates to merge when shifted up.  \n   - **Result**: No movement or merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: [4, 0, 0, 0] shifts down to [0, 0, 0, 4] (4 moves to row 3).  \n   - Column 1: [32, 4, 0, 0] shifts down to [0, 0, 32, 4] (32 and 4 move to rows 2 and 3).  \n   - Column 2: [64, 8, 2, 0] shifts down to [0, 64, 8, 2] (64, 8, 2 move to rows 1, 2, 3).  \n   - Column 3: [32, 16, 32, 4] has no merges but shifts tiles down (no movement as all tiles are non-zero).  \n   - **Result**: Tiles cluster in the bottom rows, creating empty spaces at the top. This positions smaller tiles (e.g., 4s in row 3) for potential future merges.  \n\n### Strategic Choice:\nDOWN is the best move. It shifts tiles toward the bottom, clustering smaller tiles (e.g., 4s in row 3) and creating empty spaces at the top. This setup increases the likelihood of merging adjacent tiles in subsequent moves, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and preparing for future combinations.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

It merges tiles, moves the 64 to the top row, and aligns larger tiles strategically in the top row, supporting long-term cornering of high-value tiles.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, positioning large tiles in corners, and creating future opportunities).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 32 | 64 | 32\nRow 1: 0 | 4 | 8 | 16\nRow 2: 32 | 0 | 2 | 32\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: All tiles are non-zero and cannot shift left. Remains `8|32|64|32`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `[0,4,8,16]` shift left to `4|8|16|0` (empty space at column 3).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `[32,0,2,32]` shift left to `32|2|32|0` (empty space at column 3).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `[0,0,0,4]` shift left to `4|0|0|0` (empty spaces at columns 1-3).  \n\nNo merges occur, but tiles shift into more compact positions, creating empty spaces in the rightmost columns. This aligns smaller tiles (4, 8, 16, 2) for potential future merges and keeps larger tiles (8, 32, 64) in the left half, which supports corner-based strategies.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: All tiles are non-zero and cannot shift right. Remains `8|32|64|32`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `[0,4,8,16]` cannot shift right (already right-aligned). Remains `0|4|8|16`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `[32,0,2,32]` shift right to `0|32|2|32` (empty space at column 0).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `[0,0,0,4]` cannot shift right (already right-aligned). Remains `0|0|0|4`.  \n\nOnly Row 2 shifts, resulting in minimal movement. Fewer opportunities for future merges compared to LEFT.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles `[8,0,32,0]` shift up to `8|32|0|0` (empty spaces at rows 2-3).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles `[32,4,0,0]` shift up to `32|4|0|0` (empty spaces at rows 2-3).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles `[64,8,2,0]` shift up to `64|8|2|0` (empty space at row 3).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles `[32,16,32,4]` cannot shift up (no empty spaces between non-zero tiles).  \n\nNo merges occur, but tiles shift upward. However, larger tiles (64, 32) remain spread out, reducing corner consolidation.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles `[8,0,32,0]` shift down to `0|0|8|32` (empty spaces at rows 0-1).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles `[32,4,0,0]` shift down to `0|0|32|4` (empty spaces at rows 0-1).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles `[64,8,2,0]` shift down to `0|64|8|2` (empty space at row 0).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles `[32,16,32,4]` cannot shift down (no empty spaces between non-zero tiles).  \n\nNo merges occur, and larger tiles (64, 32) are scattered downward, reducing control over their positioning.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT is the best move.

RIGHT Swipe:\n- Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent identical tiles after shifting).\n- Example: Row 1 (4|8|16|0) becomes 0|4|8|16 (no merges).\n- No score gain; shifts empty tiles to the left but does not consolidate larger tiles.\n\n#### 3.

Valid moves depend on tiles shifting into empty spaces.\n- Empty tiles are at (2,3) and (3,3) (row 2, column 3; row 3, column 3).\n- Strategic goal: Position larger tiles in corners to facilitate future merges.\n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### LEFT:\n- All rows are either full (no zeros) or have zeros on the right. Tiles cannot shift left further (e.g., row 2: `4|2|16|0` is already left-aligned). No movement occurs. **Invalid move**.\n\n#### UP:\n- All columns are full (no zeros) except column 3. Tiles in column 3 (`64|16|0|0`) cannot shift up further (already top-aligned). No movement occurs. **Invalid move**.\n\n#### DOWN:\n- Columns 0-2 are full (no zeros). Column 3 (`64|16|0|0`) shifts down, moving `64` to (2,3) and `16` to (3,3). This leaves zeros at (0,3) and (1,3). However, this removes the 64 from the top-right corner (0,3) and places smaller tiles (16) in the bottom-right corner (3,3), which is suboptimal for corner positioning.\n\n#### RIGHT:\n- Rows 0 and 1 are full (no zeros), so they remain unchanged.  \n  - Row 2 (`4|2|16|0`) shifts right to `0|4|2|16`.  \n  - Row 3 (`32|16|64|0`) shifts right to `0|32|16|64`.  \n  This places the 64 from row 3 into the bottom-right corner (3,3), a strategic corner. Additionally, column 3 now has 64 at (0,3) (top-right corner) and 64 at (3,3) (bottom-right corner), creating potential for future merges (e.g., swiping UP\/DOWN could align these 64s for merging).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT is the best move, as it positions large tiles (64) in key corners and sets up future merging opportunities.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 32 | 4 | 64\nRow 1: 64 | 4 | 8 | 16\nRow 2: 0 | 4 | 2 | 16\nRow 3: 2 | 32 | 16 | 64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). Only row 2 shifts left (from `0|4|2|16` to `4|2|16|0`). No score gain. Poor move.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). No meaningful changes. No score gain. Poor move.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Columns are processed top to bottom. Key merges occur:  \n   - **Column 1** (32, 4, 4, 32): The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8). The 32 from row 3 shifts up to row 2.  \n   - **Column 3** (64, 16, 16, 64): The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). The 64 from row 3 shifts up to row 2.  \n   Resulting board after UP:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 8 | 32 | 4 | 64  \n   Row 1: 64 | 8 | 8 | 32  \n   Row 2: 2 | 32 | 2 | 64  \n   Row 3: 0 | 0 | 16 | 0  \n   ```  \n   This move creates adjacent 8s in row 1 (columns 1 and 2), which can be merged in a future LEFT move. Empty spaces are in the bottom row, minimizing disruption to larger tiles.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Columns are processed bottom to top. Key merges occur:  \n   - **Column 1** (32, 4, 4, 32): The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8). The 32 from row 0 shifts down to row 1.  \n   - **Column 3** (64, 16, 16, 64): The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). The 64 from row 0 shifts down to row 1.  \n   Resulting board after DOWN:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0 | 0 | 4 | 0  \n   Row 1: 8 | 32 | 8 | 64  \n   Row 2: 64 | 8 | 2 | 32  \n   Row 3: 2 | 32 | 16 | 64  \n   ```  \n   While merging scores are the same as UP, the empty spaces are in the top row, which could disrupt larger tiles. Additionally, the 8s in row 1 are not adjacent (separated by 32), limiting future merge potential.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is superior because it consolidates merges, positions larger tiles in upper rows, and creates adjacent 8s for future merging. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 32 | 4 | 64\nRow 1: 64 | 8 | 8 | 32\nRow 2: 2 | 32 | 2 | 64\nRow 3: 8 | 0 | 16 | 0\n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles (8, 32, 4, 64) are distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 1**: Two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). Result: [64, 16, 32, 0].\n- **Row 2**: Tiles (2, 32, 2, 64) are distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 3**: Tiles (8, 0, 16, 0) shift left to [8, 16, 0, 0]; no merges.  \n**Outcome**: Only 1 merge (8s in Row 1). Larger tiles (64, 32) are scattered across columns.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles (8, 32, 4, 64) are distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 1**: Two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). Result: [0, 64, 16, 32].\n- **Row 2**: Tiles (2, 32, 2, 64) are distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 3**: Tiles (8, 0, 16, 0) shift right to [0, 0, 8, 16]; no merges.  \n**Outcome**: Only 1 merge (8s in Row 1). Larger tiles (64, 32, 64) align on the right (Column 3), improving future merge potential.\n\n### UP\/DOWN Moves:\n- **UP**: Columns have no adjacent equal tiles (e.g., Column 0: 8, 64, 2, 8; Column 1: 32, 8, 32, 0). No merges.\n- **DOWN**: Columns also lack adjacent equal tiles (e.g., Column 3: 64, 32, 64, 0). No merges.  \n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nMoving RIGHT aligns larger tiles (64, 32, 64) on the right edge, a corner, which is strategic for future merges. LEFT scatters larger tiles, reducing long-term potential. UP\/DOWN provide no merges and are suboptimal.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile alignment, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis\nThe current game board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8|32|4|64\nRow 1: 0|64|16|32\nRow 2: 2|32|2|64\nRow 3: 0|4|8|16\n```\nKey observations:\n- No immediate merges are possible in the current configuration (no adjacent tiles with the same value).\n- The grid has two empty tiles (0s) in Row 1, Column 0 and Row 3, Column 0.\n- Larger tiles (64, 32) are scattered, and strategic alignment (e.g., cornering large tiles) is critical for future merges.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves\n\n#### LEFT Move\n- **Row 0**: Tiles (8, 32, 4, 64) are distinct and non-zero; no shifts or merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (0, 64, 16, 32) shift left to (64, 16, 32, 0) (creates a new empty tile in Column 3).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (2, 32, 2, 64) are non-zero and distinct; no shifts or merges.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles (0, 4, 8, 16) shift left to (4, 8, 16, 0) (creates a new empty tile in Column 3).  \n\nResulting grid after LEFT:\n```\nRow 0: 8|32|4|64  \nRow 1: 64|16|32|0  \nRow 2: 2|32|2|64  \nRow 3: 4|8|16|0  \n```\n- Empty tiles are now in Row 1, Column 3 and Row 3, Column 3 (right side), which is strategic for future merges (e.g., 32s in Row 1, Column 2 could merge with a new 32 in Row 1, Column 3).  \n\n\n#### RIGHT Move\n- **Row 0**: Tiles (8, 32, 4, 64) are distinct and non-zero; no shifts or merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (0, 64, 16, 32) are already right-aligned; no shifts.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (2, 32, 2, 64) are non-zero and distinct; no shifts or merges.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles (0, 4, 8, 16) are already right-aligned; no shifts.  \n\nResulting grid after RIGHT:\n```\nRow 0: 8|32|4|64  \nRow 1: 0|64|16|32  \nRow 2: 2|32|2|64  \nRow 3: 0|4|8|16  \n```\n- No new empty tiles created; preserves the original empty tiles (left side), which is less strategic for future merges.  \n\n\n#### UP Move\n- **Column 0**: Tiles (8, 0, 2, 0) shift up to (8, 2, 0, 0) (creates empty tiles in Rows 2 and 3).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (32, 64, 32, 4) are non-zero and distinct; no shifts or merges.  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles (4, 16, 2, 8) are non-zero and distinct; no shifts or merges.  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles (64, 32, 64, 16) are non-zero and distinct; no shifts or merges.  \n\nResulting grid after UP:\n```\nRow 0: 8|32|4|64  \nRow 1: 2|64|16|32  \nRow 2: 0|32|2|64  \nRow 3: 0|4|8|16  \n```\n- Empty tiles are in Rows 2 and 3, Column 0 (left side), which is less favorable for aligning large tiles in corners.  \n\n\n#### DOWN Move\n- **Column 0**: Tiles (8, 0, 2, 0) shift down to (0, 0, 8, 2) (creates empty tiles in Rows 0 and 1).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (32, 64, 32, 4) are non-zero and distinct; no shifts or merges.  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles (4, 16, 2, 8) are non-zero and distinct; no shifts or merges.  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles (64, 32, 64, 16) are non-zero and distinct; no shifts or merges.  \n\nResulting grid after DOWN:\n```\nRow 0: 0|32|4|64  \nRow 1: 0|64|16|32  \nRow 2: 8|32|2|64  \nRow 3: 2|4|8|16  \n```\n- Empty tiles are in Rows 0 and 1, Column 0 (left side), which does not help in cornering large tiles.  \n\n\n### Conclusion\nThe LEFT move strategically shifts tiles to the left, creating empty spaces on the right (Rows 1, Column 3 and Row 3, Column 3). This alignment is favorable for future merges (e.g., 32s in Row 1, Column 2 could merge with a new 32 in Row 1, Column 3). Other moves either preserve or create less strategic empty spaces. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to maximize merges and set up future opportunities for higher-scoring combinations.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 32 | 4 | 64  \nRow 1: 64 | 16 | 32 | 32  \nRow 2: 2 | 32 | 2 | 64  \nRow 3: 4 | 8 | 16 | 0  \n```\n\n### Evaluation of Each Move:\n1. **UP\/DOWN Swipes**:  \n   - **UP**: Processing columns upward, no adjacent equal tiles are found in any column (e.g., column 0: 8, 64, 2, 4; column 1: 32, 16, 32, 8). No merges occur.  \n   - **DOWN**: Similarly, processing columns downward also yields no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur.  \n\n2. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: All tiles (8, 32, 4, 64) are distinct; no merges.  \n   - **Row 1**: The two 32s (columns 2 and 3) merge into 64, resulting in `64 | 16 | 64 | 0` (score +64).  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles (2, 32, 2, 64) are distinct; no merges.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles (4, 8, 16, 0) shift left; no merges.  \n   - **Outcome**: Only one merge in Row 1, with 64s placed in columns 0 and 2 (non-adjacent).  \n\n3. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: All tiles (8, 32, 4, 64) are distinct; no merges.  \n   - **Row 1**: The two 32s (columns 2 and 3) merge into 64, shifting right to `64 | 16 | 0 | 64` (score +64).  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles (2, 32, 2, 64) are distinct; no merges.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles (4, 8, 16, 0) shift right to `0 | 4 | 8 | 16`; no merges.  \n   - **Key Insight**: After merging, column 3 (vertical) now has 64 (Row 0), 64 (Row 1 from merge), 64 (Row 2), and 0 (Row 3). This creates three 64s in a vertical column, setting up future opportunities to merge them (e.g., a subsequent UP swipe could merge the top two 64s into 128).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT swipe merges the 32s in Row 1, scores 64, and strategically positions three 64s vertically in column 3, enabling future high-value merges. This is more advantageous than LEFT, which only merges 32s without such vertical potential. UP and DOWN offer no merges.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) by evaluating tile merges, score gain, and strategic positioning of large tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 32 | 4 | 64\nRow 1: 2 | 64 | 16 | 64\nRow 2: 2 | 32 | 2 | 64\nRow 3: 0 | 4 | 8 | 16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- All rows have no adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to shift into. No merges occur. Score gain: 0.  \n- Result: No meaningful changes. Poor choice.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Similarly, all rows have no adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to shift into. No merges occur. Score gain: 0.  \n- Result: No meaningful changes. Poor choice.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles [8, 2, 2, 0] shift up. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4). Result: [8, 4, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles [32, 64, 32, 4] have no adjacent equals. No merges. Result: [32, 64, 32, 4].  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles [4, 16, 2, 8] have no adjacent equals. No merges. Result: [4, 16, 2, 8].  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles [64, 64, 64, 16] shift up. The first two 64s merge into 128 (score +128). Result: [128, 64, 16, 0].  \n- **Total Score Gain**: 4 + 128 = 132.  \n- **Key Strategic Benefit**: The largest tile (128) is positioned in the top-right corner, a prime location for future merges.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles [8, 2, 2, 0] shift down. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4). Result: [0, 8, 0, 4].  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles [32, 64, 32, 4] have no adjacent equals. No merges. Result: [32, 64, 32, 4].  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles [4, 16, 2, 8] have no adjacent equals. No merges. Result: [4, 16, 2, 8].  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles [64, 64, 64, 16] shift down. The two 64s in the middle merge into 128 (score +128). Result: [0, 64, 128, 16].  \n- **Total Score Gain**: 4 + 128 = 132.  \n- **Strategic Drawback**: The largest tile (128) is positioned in the middle of the grid (row 2, column 3), which is less ideal for future merges compared to a corner.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and DOWN yield the same score, but UP positions the largest tile (128) in the top-right corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners for better future merges. Thus, UP is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate potential merges and tile shifts. The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up for future moves.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 32 | 4 | 128  \nRow 1: 4 | 64 | 16 | 64  \nRow 2: 8 | 32 | 2 | 16  \nRow 3: 0 | 4 | 8 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: All tiles (8, 32, 4, 128) are distinct and no empty spaces exist. No shift or merge.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (4, 64, 16, 64) are distinct; 64s are not adjacent. No merge.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (8, 32, 2, 16) are distinct. No merge.  \n- **Row 3**: Empty spaces (0s) shift left, resulting in 4 | 8 | 0 | 0. No merge.  \n**Result**: No merges. Score = 0.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles (8, 32, 4, 128) are distinct. No shift or merge.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (4, 64, 16, 64) are distinct; 64s are not adjacent. No merge.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (8, 32, 2, 16) are distinct. No merge.  \n- **Row 3**: Empty spaces (0s) shift right, resulting in 0 | 0 | 4 | 8. No merge.  \n**Result**: No merges. Score = 0.  \n\n\n#### **UP Move**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles (8, 4, 8, 0) shift up. 8s are separated by 4, so no merge.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (32, 64, 32, 4) shift up. 32s are separated by 64, so no merge.  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles (4, 16, 2, 8) are distinct. No merge.  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles (128, 64, 16, 0) shift up. No merge.  \n**Result**: No merges. Score = 0.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Move**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles (8, 4, 8, 0) shift down. After shifting, 8s in rows 2 and 3 become adjacent and merge into 16.  \n  - Original: [8, 4, 8, 0] → Shift down → [0, 4, 8, 8] → Merge → [0, 4, 16, 0].  \n  - **Merge Score**: 16.  \n- **Other Columns**: No merges occur (columns 1, 2, 3 have distinct or non-adjacent tiles).  \n**Result**: One merge (8+8=16). Score = 16.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN move results in a merge of two 8s into a 16, yielding 16 points. Other moves do not produce merges. Thus, DOWN is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges and position larger tiles in corners for strategic advantage.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64|32|4|0\nRow 1: 8|64|16|128\nRow 2: 4|32|2|64\nRow 3: 8|4|8|16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows are already left-justified or have distinct values. No merges occur. The empty tile (row 0, column 3) remains in the same position. No strategic benefit.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but all rows have distinct values. No merges occur. The empty tile moves to row 0, column 0, which is not a corner. Unfavorable for large tile positioning.  \n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift down, but columns have distinct values. No merges occur. The empty tile remains in row 0, column 3. Larger tiles (e.g., 128 in row 1, column 3) stay in non-corner positions.  \n\n4. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed upward. Column 3 (originally `[0, 128, 64, 16]`) shifts up, moving 128 to row 0, column 3 (top-right corner), 64 to row 1, column 3, 16 to row 2, column 3, and leaving row 3, column 3 empty. This positions the 128 tile in a corner, aligning with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in corners. Other columns remain unchanged but do not block future merges.  \n\n\nThe UP swipe moves the 128 tile to the top-right corner (a strategic position) and leaves the empty tile in the bottom-right corner, which is ideal for future merges. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential for merging tiles and creating valid moves. The current game board is:\n\n```\n64|32|4|128\n8|64|16|64\n4|32|2|16\n8|4|8|32\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid Status**: All tiles are occupied (no zeros). A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or moving tiles into empty spaces. Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend solely on merging adjacent tiles.\n2. **Horizontal Adjacents**: No row contains adjacent tiles of the same number. For example:\n   - Row 0: 64, 32, 4, 128 (all distinct)\n   - Row 1: 8, 64, 16, 64 (64s are separated by 16, not adjacent)\n   - Row 2: 4, 32, 2, 16 (all distinct)\n   - Row 3: 8, 4, 8, 32 (8s are separated by 4, not adjacent)\n3. **Vertical Adjacents**: No column contains adjacent tiles of the same number. For example:\n   - Column 0: 64, 8, 4, 8 (8s are separated by 4, not adjacent)\n   - Column 1: 32, 64, 32, 4 (32s are separated by 64, not adjacent)\n   - Column 2: 4, 16, 2, 8 (all distinct)\n   - Column 3: 128, 64, 16, 32 (all distinct)\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: None of these directions result in merges because there are no adjacent tiles of the same number. Since the grid is full, no tiles can shift into empty spaces. Thus, all moves are invalid under the game rules.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent tiles to merge, meaning no valid moves remain. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the choice is arbitrary. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and game rules. The goal is to identify moves that enable tile merges (to gain score) or create empty spaces (to allow future moves). The grid is currently full (no 0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value to merge.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 32 | 4 | 128  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 16 | 64  \nRow 2: 4 | 32 | 2 | 16  \nRow 3: 8 | 4 | 8 | 32  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows are already left-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur.  \n   - Example: Row 0 (64, 32, 4, 128) remains unchanged; no merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - All rows are already right-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur.  \n   - Example: Row 1 (8, 64, 16, 64) remains unchanged; the 64s in columns 1 and 3 are not adjacent after shifting.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - All columns are already top-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur.  \n   - Example: Column 1 (32, 64, 32, 4) remains unchanged; the 32s in rows 0 and 2 are not adjacent after shifting.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - All columns are already bottom-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur.  \n   - Example: Column 0 (64, 8, 4, 8) remains unchanged; the 8s in rows 1 and 3 are not adjacent after shifting.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and there are no adjacent tiles with the same value. Thus, no valid moves exist to merge tiles or create empty spaces. However, per the problem constraints, the answer must be one of the four directions. Given no merges are possible, the choice is arbitrary, but typically, maintaining larger tiles in corners (e.g., RIGHT to keep 128 in the top-right) is a strategic heuristic.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or tile movements in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number to merge. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 32 | 4 | 128  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 16 | 64  \nRow 2: 4 | 32 | 2 | 16  \nRow 3: 8 | 4 | 8 | 32  \n\n\n### LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are 64, 32, 4, 128 (all distinct, no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles are 8, 64, 16, 64 (no adjacent duplicates, no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles are 4, 32, 2, 16 (all distinct, no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles are 8, 4, 8, 32 (no adjacent duplicates, no merges).  \nNo merges or tile movements occur.  \n\n\n### RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are 64, 32, 4, 128 (all distinct, no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles are 8, 64, 16, 64 (no adjacent duplicates, no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles are 4, 32, 2, 16 (all distinct, no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles are 8, 4, 8, 32 (no adjacent duplicates, no merges).  \nNo merges or tile movements occur.  \n\n\n### UP Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles are 64, 8, 4, 8 (no adjacent duplicates, no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles are 32, 64, 32, 4 (no adjacent duplicates, no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles are 4, 16, 2, 8 (all distinct, no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles are 128, 64, 16, 32 (all distinct, no merges).  \nNo merges or tile movements occur.  \n\n\n### DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles are 64, 8, 4, 8 (no adjacent duplicates, no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles are 32, 64, 32, 4 (no adjacent duplicates, no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles are 4, 16, 2, 8 (all distinct, no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles are 128, 64, 16, 32 (all distinct, no merges).  \nNo merges or tile movements occur.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full (no empty tiles), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number in any direction. This means no valid moves can merge tiles or shift them into empty spaces. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any direction is technically invalid, but a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges, tile movement, and strategic positioning of larger tiles. The current game board is:\n\n```\n64|32|4|128\n8|64|16|64\n4|32|2|16\n8|4|8|32\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid State**: The grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles, 0s). This means valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n2. **Adjacent Tiles**: No adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. For example:\n   - Row 1: 64, 32, 4, 128 (all distinct).\n   - Row 2: 8, 64, 16, 64 (64s are non-adjacent).\n   - Row 3: 4, 32, 2, 16 (all distinct).\n   - Row 4: 8, 4, 8, 32 (8s are non-adjacent).\n   - Columns: All columns also lack adjacent duplicates.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Since the grid is full, swiping left or right cannot shift tiles (no empty spaces to fill). No merges occur.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Similarly, swiping up or down cannot shift tiles (no empty spaces). No merges occur.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nEven though no immediate merges are possible, the goal is to position tiles for future merges. The largest tile (128) is in the top-right corner (row 1, column 4). Swiping **UP** keeps larger tiles (e.g., 128, 64) in the top rows, aligning with the strategy of consolidating larger tiles in a corner to facilitate future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid, where all tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces) and no adjacent tiles have the same value. A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since the grid is full, we focus on potential merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 32 | 4 | 128  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 16 | 64  \nRow 2: 4 | 32 | 2 | 16  \nRow 3: 8 | 4 | 8 | 32  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Each row is processed left to right. No adjacent tiles in any row are equal, so no merges occur. All tiles are already shifted left (no empty spaces), so no movement. **Invalid**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row is processed right to left. No adjacent tiles in any row are equal, so no merges occur. All tiles are already shifted right (no empty spaces), so no movement. **Invalid**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Each column is processed top to bottom. No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, so no merges occur. All tiles are already shifted up (no empty spaces), so no movement. **Invalid**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Each column is processed bottom to top. No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, so no merges occur. All tiles are already shifted down (no empty spaces), so no movement. **Invalid**.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions are invalid because the grid is full, and no adjacent tiles can merge. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the directions, we default to **DOWN** (common in such scenarios where no valid moves exist but an answer is required).\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or valid shifts in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number to merge.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 32 | 4 | 128\nRow 1: 8  | 64 | 16| 64\nRow 2: 4  | 32 | 2 | 16\nRow 3: 8  | 4  | 8 | 32\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 1 (`8, 64, 16, 64`) has no adjacent duplicates, and shifting left would not merge any tiles.  \n   - No merges occur in any row.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 1 (`8, 64, 16, 64`) has 64s separated by 16, so shifting right would not merge them.  \n   - No merges occur in any row.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - All columns have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Column 1 (`32, 64, 32, 4`) has 32s separated by 64, so shifting up would not merge them.  \n   - No merges occur in any column.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - All columns have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Column 0 (`64, 8, 4, 8`) has 8s separated by 4, so shifting down would not merge them.  \n   - No merges occur in any column.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied, and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number in any direction. According to the rules, no valid moves remain, and the game would end. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and no direction leads to a merge or valid shift, the answer is based on the absence of valid moves, but the required format forces a direction choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and grid dynamics.

For a move to be valid, there must be adjacent tiles of the same value to merge (since no empty spaces exist to shift into).\n2. **Adjacent Tiles Check**: No adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. This means no merges are possible in any direction.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Moving left or right would not shift tiles (grid is full), and no adjacent tiles in rows are the same to merge.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Moving up or down would not shift tiles (grid is full), and no adjacent tiles in columns are the same to merge.\n\nSince all moves are invalid (no merges possible and no empty spaces to shift into), the game would end. However, per the problem's requirement to select one of the four directions, we must choose based on the given options.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid, where all tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces) and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) are the same.

No adjacent equal tiles exist in any row, and no empty spaces allow tiles to shift. Thus, no movement or merging occurs.  \n2. **RIGHT Swipe**: Similarly, all rows are full with distinct values. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any row, and no empty spaces allow tiles to shift. No movement or merging occurs.  \n3. **UP Swipe**: All columns are fully occupied with distinct values.

For example, Row 0: `64, 32, 4, 128` (no duplicates), Row 1: `8, 64, 16, 64` (64s are separated by 16), Row 2: `4, 32, 2, 16` (no duplicates), Row 3: `8, 4, 8, 32` (8s are separated by 4). No merges or shifts are possible. **Invalid**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Similarly, all rows are fully occupied with no adjacent duplicates when shifted right. For example, Row 1: `8, 64, 16, 64` (64s remain separated by 16), Row 3: `8, 4, 8, 32` (8s remain separated by 4). No merges or shifts are possible. **Invalid**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   All columns are fully occupied with no adjacent duplicates. For example, Column 0: `64, 8, 4, 8` (8s are separated by 4), Column 1: `32, 64, 32, 4` (32s are separated by 64), Column 2: `4, 16, 2, 8` (no duplicates), Column 3: `128, 64, 16, 32` (no duplicates). No merges or shifts are possible. **Invalid**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Columns are fully occupied, but analyzing Column 0 (`64, 8, 4, 8`) and Column 1 (`32, 64, 32, 4`) reveals potential for merging after shifting. For Column 0, shifting down could align the two 8s (originally in Rows 1 and 3) into adjacent positions (Rows 2 and 3), allowing them to merge into 16. Similarly, Column 1’s 32s (Rows 0 and 2) could shift down to align and merge. While initial analysis suggested no merges, strategic shifting can create adjacency for merging. **Valid**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the only move that can potentially merge tiles (e.g., 8s in Column 0 or 32s in Column 1) after shifting, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges and strategic positioning. The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value to merge.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 32 | 4 | 128  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 16 | 64  \nRow 2: 4 | 32 | 2 | 16  \nRow 3: 8 | 4 | 8 | 32  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Each row is processed left-to-right.  \n   - Row 0: 64, 32, 4, 128 (no adjacent matches).  \n   - Row 1: 8, 64, 16, 64 (no adjacent matches; 64s are separated by 16).  \n   - Row 2: 4, 32, 2, 16 (no adjacent matches).  \n   - Row 3: 8, 4, 8, 32 (no adjacent matches; 8s are separated by 4).  \n   - **No merges possible**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row is processed right-to-left.  \n   - Row 0: 64, 32, 4, 128 (no adjacent matches).  \n   - Row 1: 8, 64, 16, 64 (no adjacent matches; 64s are separated by 16).  \n   - Row 2: 4, 32, 2, 16 (no adjacent matches).  \n   - Row 3: 8, 4, 8, 32 (no adjacent matches; 8s are separated by 4).  \n   - **No merges possible**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Each column is processed top-to-bottom.  \n   - Column 0: 64, 8, 4, 8 (no adjacent matches; 8s are separated by 4).  \n   - Column 1: 32, 64, 32, 4 (no adjacent matches; 32s are separated by 64).  \n   - Column 2: 4, 16, 2, 8 (no adjacent matches).  \n   - Column 3: 128, 64, 16, 32 (no adjacent matches).  \n   - **No merges possible**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Each column is processed bottom-to-top.  \n   - Column 0: 64, 8, 4, 8 (no adjacent matches; 8s are separated by 4).  \n   - Column 1: 32, 64, 32, 4 (no adjacent matches; 32s are separated by 64).  \n   - Column 2: 4, 16, 2, 8 (no adjacent matches).  \n   - Column 3: 128, 64, 16, 32 (no adjacent matches).  \n   - **No merges possible**.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions fail to produce merges, and since the grid is full with no empty spaces, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the directions. Given no strategic advantage, any direction is equally invalid, but we arbitrarily choose **LEFT**.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of tile merging and movement. The grid is:\n\n```\n64|32|4|128\n8|64|16|64\n4|32|2|16\n8|4|8|32\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Grid State**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no zeros), so there are no empty spaces to shift tiles into.\n- **Adjacent Tiles**: No horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles have the same value. For example:\n  - Rows: No adjacent duplicates (e.g., row 1: 8, 64, 16, 64 has 64s separated by 16).\n  - Columns: No adjacent duplicates (e.g., column 1: 32, 64, 32, 4 has 32s separated by 64).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Since all tiles are filled and no adjacent duplicates exist, shifting left or right will not cause any merging or movement of tiles. The grid remains unchanged.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Similarly, vertical shifts (up\/down) will not merge or move tiles, as there are no adjacent duplicates and no empty spaces to shift into.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNo valid moves exist because there are no adjacent tiles to merge and no empty spaces to shift into. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or shifts in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

For example:  \n   - Row 0: [64, 32, 4, 128] (no equal adjacent tiles).  \n   - Row 1: [8, 64, 16, 64] (no equal adjacent tiles).  \n   - Row 2: [4, 32, 2, 16] (no equal adjacent tiles).  \n   - Row 3: [8, 4, 8, 32] (no equal adjacent tiles).  \n   No merges or shifts occur. **LEFT is invalid**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Similar to LEFT, all rows are fully occupied with no adjacent equal tiles. Reversing rows to simulate right movement (equivalent to left movement on reversed rows) also shows no merges. For example:  \n   - Row 1 reversed: [64, 16, 64, 8] (no equal adjacent tiles).  \n   No merges or shifts occur. **RIGHT is invalid**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Each column is checked for adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces. All columns are fully occupied (no zeros), and no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. For example:  \n   - Column 0: [64, 8, 4, 8] (no equal adjacent tiles).  \n   - Column 1: [32, 64, 32, 4] (no equal adjacent tiles).  \n   - Column 2: [4, 16, 2, 8] (no equal adjacent tiles).  \n   - Column 3: [128, 64, 16, 32] (no equal adjacent tiles).  \n   No merges or shifts occur. **UP is invalid**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Each column is checked for adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces. All columns are fully occupied (no zeros), and no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. For example:  \n   - Column 1: [32, 64, 32, 4] (no equal adjacent tiles).  \n   - Column 3: [128, 64, 16, 32] (no equal adjacent tiles).  \n   No merges or shifts occur. **DOWN is invalid**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are invalid because there are no adjacent equal tiles to merge and no empty spaces to shift tiles into. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the answer defaults to the first invalid direction.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of tile movement, merging, and valid moves. A valid move requires either adjacent tiles of the same number (which can merge) or empty spaces (to shift tiles into). \n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 32 | 4 | 128  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 16 | 64  \nRow 2: 4 | 32 | 2 | 16  \nRow 3: 8 | 4 | 8 | 32  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   All rows are fully occupied (no zeros), and no adjacent tiles in any row are the same. Tiles cannot shift left, and no merges occur. No valid movement.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   All rows are fully occupied (no zeros), and no adjacent tiles in any row are the same. Tiles cannot shift right, and no merges occur. No valid movement.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   All columns are fully occupied (no zeros), and no adjacent tiles in any column are the same. Tiles cannot shift up, and no merges occur. No valid movement.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   All columns are fully occupied (no zeros), and no adjacent tiles in any column are the same. Tiles cannot shift down, and no merges occur. No valid movement.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is completely full with no empty spaces, and there are no adjacent tiles of the same number in any direction. This means no valid moves exist (as per the rules: a valid move requires either adjacent same tiles or empty spaces to shift into). However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we default to **DOWN** (common in such scenarios where no optimal move is apparent).  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for possible merges and tile shifts in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 64|32|4|128  \nRow 1: 8|64|16|64  \nRow 2: 4|32|2|16  \nRow 3: 8|4|8|32  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \nTiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row to merge. All rows remain unchanged. No score gain.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nTiles shift right. Key observation:  \n- **Row 1**: Original tiles [8, 64, 16, 64]. When shifted right, the two 64s (at positions 1 and 3) become adjacent (positions 2 and 3). They merge into 128, adding 128 to the score. The row becomes [8, 16, 0, 128].  \nOther rows have no merges. This direction results in a valid merge and score gain.  \n\n#### **UP**  \nTiles shift up. All columns have no adjacent equal tiles to merge. No score gain.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \nTiles shift down. All columns have no adjacent equal tiles to merge. No score gain.  \n\n\nThe only direction with a valid merge (and score gain) is **RIGHT**.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current 4x4 grid has no empty tiles (all 16 tiles are filled) and no immediately adjacent same-numbered tiles. A valid move requires either merging tiles by shifting them into adjacency or creating empty spaces (though none exist here). The goal is to maximize merges and score.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   No merges occur. All rows have unique or non-adjacent same-numbered tiles. For example, row 0: `64|32|4|128` (all unique), row 1: `8|64|16|64` (64s are separated by 16), etc. No valid merges.  \n\n2. **UP**:  \n   No merges occur. All columns have unique or non-adjacent same-numbered tiles. For example, column 0: `64|8|4|8` (8s are separated by 4), column 1: `32|64|32|4` (32s are separated by 64), etc. No valid merges.  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Limited merges. Column 0: `64|8|4|8` can merge 8s (row 1 and row 3) into 16 (score +16). Column 1: `32|64|32|4` can merge 32s (row 0 and row 2) into 64 (score +64). Total score: 80.  \n\n4. **RIGHT**:  \n   Significant merges. Row 1: `8|64|16|64` has 64s (columns 1 and 3) that shift right, merge into 128 (score +128). Row 3: `8|4|8|32` has 8s (columns 0 and 2) that shift right, merge into 16 (score +16). Total score: 144.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nMerging 64s into 128 (RIGHT) is more valuable than merging 32s into 64 (DOWN). Additionally, the 128 in row 1, column 3 (merged from RIGHT) aligns with the existing 128 in row 0, column 3, creating future merge potential.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on whether tiles can merge or shift into empty spaces (valid moves). A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or shifting tiles into empty spaces. The current grid has no empty tiles (no zeros), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 32 | 4 | 128  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 16 | 64  \nRow 2: 4 | 32 | 2 | 16  \nRow 3: 8 | 4 | 8 | 32  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: 64, 32, 4, 128 (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Row 1: 8, 64, 16, 64 (no adjacent duplicates; 64s are separated by 16).  \n   - Row 2: 4, 32, 2, 16 (all distinct).  \n   - Row 3: 8, 4, 8, 32 (no adjacent duplicates; 8s are separated by 4).  \n   - **No merges or shifts possible.**  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: 64, 32, 4, 128 (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Row 1: 8, 64, 16, 64 (no adjacent duplicates; 64s are separated by 16).  \n   - Row 2: 4, 32, 2, 16 (all distinct).  \n   - Row 3: 8, 4, 8, 32 (no adjacent duplicates; 8s are separated by 4).  \n   - **No merges or shifts possible.**  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: 64, 8, 4, 8 (no adjacent duplicates; 8s are separated by 4).  \n   - Column 1: 32, 64, 32, 4 (no adjacent duplicates; 32s are separated by 64).  \n   - Column 2: 4, 16, 2, 8 (all distinct).  \n   - Column 3: 128, 64, 16, 32 (all distinct).  \n   - **No merges or shifts possible.**  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: 64, 8, 4, 8 (no adjacent duplicates; 8s are separated by 4).  \n   - Column 1: 32, 64, 32, 4 (no adjacent duplicates; 32s are separated by 64).  \n   - Column 2: 4, 16, 2, 8 (all distinct).  \n   - Column 3: 128, 64, 16, 32 (all distinct).  \n   - **No merges or shifts possible.**  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions lack adjacent tiles to merge and have no empty spaces for tiles to shift into. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the move with the least negative impact (or the most neutral) is chosen. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and the goal of merging tiles to maximize scores.

When swiping down, tiles shift to the bottom. The non-zero tiles are [64, 8, 4, 8]. After shifting down, the column becomes [0, 64, 8, 8]. The two 8s (row 2 and row 3) are adjacent and merge into 16, adding 16 to the score.  \n- Other columns (1, 2, 3) have no merges.  \n\n**Result**: A merge of two 8s into 16, generating a score of 16.\n\nThe only direction that allows a merge (and thus increases the score) is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning.

Thus, valid moves depend solely on merging adjacent tiles.\n2. **Adjacent Tiles**: Checking all horizontal and vertical adjacent pairs, no two tiles are equal.

When moving down:  \n     - The `8` in row1 (column0) shifts down past `4` (row2, column0) to row3 (column0), merging with the `8` in row3 (column0) to form `16`.  \n     - This creates an empty space (0) in row1 (column0), and the `4` in row2 (column0) shifts down to row2 (column0).  \n   - Other columns (1, 2, 3) have no adjacent equal tiles and remain unchanged.  \n\n   The merge in column0 (row3) is valid, making DOWN a valid move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the only valid move, as it allows merging two `8` tiles in column0, row1 and row3, into a `16` tile.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The grid is:\n\n```\n64|32|4|128\n8|64|16|64\n4|32|2|16\n8|4|8|32\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **No Empty Tiles**: The grid is completely filled (no zeros), so any move must involve shifting tiles into occupied spaces or merging adjacent tiles.\n2. **No Immediate Merges**: All adjacent tiles (horizontally and vertically) are distinct. For example:\n   - Rows: No two adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., row 1: `8,64,16,64` has 64s separated by 16).\n   - Columns: No two adjacent tiles in any column are the same (e.g., column 1: `32,64,32,4` has 32s separated by 64).\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipe**: In a full grid with no adjacent duplicates, shifting left or right will not merge any tiles. All tiles remain in their original positions because there are no empty spaces to shift into, and no adjacent tiles to merge.\n- **UP\/DOWN Swipe**: Similarly, shifting up or down will not merge any tiles. Columns are full with distinct adjacent tiles, so no movement or merging occurs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are the same, no valid moves (merges or shifts into empty spaces) are possible. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given no strategic advantage, any direction is technically a valid input, though no actual change occurs.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. The grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number to merge.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 32 | 4 | 128\nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 16 | 64\nRow 2: 4 | 32 | 2 | 16\nRow 3: 8 | 4 | 8 | 32\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows are checked for adjacent merges. For example, Row 1: `8 | 64 | 16 | 64` has no adjacent duplicates. Similarly, other rows (0, 2, 3) also lack adjacent duplicates. No tiles merge or shift, so LEFT is invalid.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Rows are checked for merges when shifted right. For example, Row 1: `8 | 64 | 16 | 64` has no adjacent duplicates even when shifted right. Other rows (0, 2, 3) also lack merges. No tiles merge or shift, so RIGHT is invalid.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are checked for merges when shifted up. For example, Column 1: `32 | 64 | 32 | 4` has no adjacent duplicates. Other columns (0, 2, 3) also lack merges. No tiles merge or shift, so UP is invalid.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are checked for merges when shifted down. For example, Column 0: `64 | 8 | 4 | 8` has no adjacent duplicates. Other columns (1, 2, 3) also lack merges. No tiles merge or shift, so DOWN is invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid has no empty tiles, and no adjacent tiles share the same number. Thus, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, any direction is technically invalid, but a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) by evaluating if tiles can merge or shift, which contributes to scoring and strategic tile positioning. The game board is full (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number to merge.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Each row is processed to shift tiles left and merge adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Row 1: [64, 32, 4, 128] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [8, 64, 16, 64] (64s are separated by 16, no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [4, 32, 2, 16] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Row 4: [8, 4, 8, 32] (8s are separated by 4, no merges).  \n   No merges occur.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Each row is processed to shift tiles right and merge adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Row 1: [64, 32, 4, 128] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [8, 64, 16, 64] (64s are separated by 16, no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [4, 32, 2, 16] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Row 4: [8, 4, 8, 32] (8s are separated by 4, no merges).  \n   No merges occur.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Each column is processed to shift tiles up and merge adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Column 1: [64, 8, 4, 8] (8s are separated by 4, no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [32, 64, 32, 4] (32s are separated by 64, no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [4, 16, 2, 8] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 4: [128, 64, 16, 32] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   No merges occur.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Each column is processed to shift tiles down and merge adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Column 1: [64, 8, 4, 8] (8s are separated by 4, no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [32, 64, 32, 4] (32s are separated by 64, no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [4, 16, 2, 8] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 4: [128, 64, 16, 32] (all distinct, no merges).  \n   No merges occur.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves result in no merges, as there are no adjacent tiles of the same number. However, since the game requires selecting a direction, and strategic advice suggests keeping larger tiles in a corner (e.g., 128 in the top-right), LEFT is chosen as a neutral direction that does not disrupt the current tile distribution.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging rules. The goal is to identify which direction allows for the most strategic tile merges to maximize scores.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 32 | 4 | 128  \nRow 1: 8 | 64 | 16 | 64  \nRow 2: 4 | 32 | 2 | 16  \nRow 3: 8 | 4 | 8 | 32  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles `64, 32, 4, 128` are all distinct. No merges.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles `8, 64, 16, 64` are distinct. No merges.  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles `4, 32, 2, 16` are distinct. No merges.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles `8, 4, 8, 32` are distinct. No merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles `64, 32, 4, 128` are distinct. No merges.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles `8, 64, 16, 64` shift right. The two `64`s in columns 1 and 3 become adjacent after shifting, merging into `128`. The row becomes `0 | 8 | 16 | 128`.  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles `4, 32, 2, 16` are distinct. No merges.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles `8, 4, 8, 32` are distinct. No merges.  \n   **Result**: Merges `64 + 64 = 128` in Row 1, earning 128 points.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles `64, 8, 4, 8` are distinct. No merges.  \n   - **Column 1**: Tiles `32, 64, 32, 4` are distinct. No merges.  \n   - **Column 2**: Tiles `4, 16, 2, 8` are distinct. No merges.  \n   - **Column 3**: Tiles `128, 64, 16, 32` are distinct. No merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles `64, 8, 4, 8` are distinct. No merges.  \n   - **Column 1**: Tiles `32, 64, 32, 4` are distinct. No merges.  \n   - **Column 2**: Tiles `4, 16, 2, 8` are distinct. No merges.  \n   - **Column 3**: Tiles `128, 64, 16, 32` are distinct. No merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only direction with a valid merge is **RIGHT**, where two `64`s in Row 1 merge into `128`, providing a score boost. Other directions yield no merges.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of merging tiles and creating valid moves.

For example:\n   - Row 0: `64, 32, 4, 128` (all distinct).\n   - Row 1: `8, 64, 16, 64` (64s are separated by 16, not adjacent).\n   - Row 3: `8, 4, 8, 32` (8s are separated by 4, not adjacent).\n   - Columns: All columns also have distinct adjacent tiles (e.g., column 1: `32, 64, 32, 4` has 32s separated by 64).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipes**: Since the grid is full (no empty spaces) and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal, shifting left or right will not merge any tiles or change the board.\n- **UP\/DOWN Swipes**: Similarly, all columns are full with no adjacent equal tiles. Shifting up or down will not merge any tiles or alter the board.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere are no valid moves (no adjacent equal tiles to merge, and no empty spaces to shift tiles into). However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any direction is technically invalid, but we must choose from the options.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile alignment. The current board has no empty tiles (all positions are filled with distinct numbers), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number to merge. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **LEFT Move**  \nEach row is checked for adjacent duplicates. All rows have distinct numbers with no adjacent duplicates (e.g., Row 0: 64, 32, 4, 128; Row 1: 8, 64, 16, 64; etc.). No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift left (board remains unchanged). **Invalid move**.\n\n### **RIGHT Move**  \nSimilar to LEFT, all rows have distinct numbers with no adjacent duplicates. Tiles cannot shift right (board remains unchanged). **Invalid move**.\n\n### **UP Move**  \nEach column is checked for vertical duplicates. All columns have distinct numbers with no adjacent duplicates (e.g., Column 0: 64, 8, 4, 8; Column 1: 32, 64, 32, 4; etc.).

However, per the problem constraints, one of the four directions must be selected.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or tile movements in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or moving tiles into empty spaces.

For example:  \n     - Column 0: 64, 8, 4, 8 (8s remain separated by 4).  \n     - Column 1: 32, 64, 32, 4 (32s remain separated by 64).  \n     - Column 2: 4, 16, 2, 8 (all distinct).  \n     - Column 3: 128, 64, 16, 32 (all distinct).  \n   - No merges or shifts are possible. **Invalid**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions are invalid because there are no adjacent equal tiles to merge and no empty spaces to shift tiles into. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any direction is technically acceptable (as the game ends after the 100th epoch regardless). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move for the given 4x4 grid at epoch 100, we analyze the possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number that can merge. \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All rows are already left-aligned with no adjacent duplicates. For example:  \n   - Row 0: [64, 32, 4, 128] (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [8, 64, 16, 64] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [4, 32, 2, 16] (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [8, 4, 8, 32] (no merges).  \n   No merges occur, and the grid remains unchanged.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   All rows are already right-aligned with no adjacent duplicates. For example:  \n   - Row 0: [64, 32, 4, 128] (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [8, 64, 16, 64] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [4, 32, 2, 16] (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [8, 4, 8, 32] (no merges).  \n   No merges occur, and the grid remains unchanged.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   All columns are already top-aligned with no adjacent duplicates. For example:  \n   - Column 0: [64, 8, 4, 8] (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: [32, 64, 32, 4] (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [4, 16, 2, 8] (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [128, 64, 16, 32] (no merges).  \n   No merges occur, and the grid remains unchanged.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   All columns are already bottom-aligned with no adjacent duplicates. For example:  \n   - Column 0: [64, 8, 4, 8] (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: [32, 64, 32, 4] (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [4, 16, 2, 8] (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [128, 64, 16, 32] (no merges).  \n   No merges occur, and the grid remains unchanged.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe grid is fully occupied with no adjacent tiles of the same number, meaning no valid merges are possible. However, since the game ends after the 100th epoch, any direction is technically acceptable. \n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: LEFT'\nRules:The game is played on a 4x4 grid, with each tile containing a number that is a power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048). Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n64|32|4|128\n8|64|16|64\n4|32|2|16\n8|4|8|32\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

In rows 1 and 2, the 2s are already in the leftmost position (column 0) and cannot move further. No tiles merge or shift, so this is not a valid move.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right. In rows 1 and 2, the 2s move to the rightmost position (column 3). However, the 2s remain in separate rows and do not merge. This is a valid move (tiles shift into empty spaces) but does not merge tiles.  \n3. **UP**: Tiles shift upward. Column 0 contains 2 (row 1) and 2 (row 2). When shifting up:  \n   - The 2 in row 1 moves to row 0.  \n   - The 2 in row 2 moves to row 1.  \n   - These adjacent 2s merge into a 4 in row 0, column 0. This is a valid move and scores 4.  \n4. **DOWN**: Tiles shift downward. Column 0 contains 2 (row 1) and 2 (row 2). When shifting down:  \n   - The 2 in row 1 moves to row 3.  \n   - The 2 in row 2 moves to row 2.  \n   - These adjacent 2s merge into a 4 in row 3, column 0. This is a valid move and scores 4.  \n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nThe goal is to merge tiles strategically and keep larger tiles in corners. Both UP and DOWN merge the 2s into a 4. However, merging upward places the 4 in the top-left corner (row 0, column 0), which aligns with the strategy of building larger tiles in a corner for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on strategic goals like consolidating tiles, keeping larger tiles in a corner, and setting up for future merges.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|2|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\nThe largest tile is 4 (at (0,0)), and there is a 2 at (2,2). All other tiles are empty (0).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [4,0,0,0] → 4 stays, no change.  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,0] → no change.  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,2,0] → 2 shifts to (2,0).  \n   - Resulting board (before new tile):  \n     ```\n     4|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     2|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - This spreads the 2 to row 2, column 0, away from the 4. Not ideal for future merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [4,0,0,0] → 4 shifts to (0,3).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,0] → no change.  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,2,0] → 2 shifts to (2,3).  \n   - Resulting board (before new tile):  \n     ```\n     0|0|0|4  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|2  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - This moves the 4 and 2 to the far right, spreading them out. Poor for corner consolidation.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom.  \n   - Column 0: [4,0,0,0] → 4 stays at (0,0).  \n   - Column 2: [0,0,2,0] → 2 shifts up to (0,2).  \n   - Resulting board (before new tile):  \n     ```\n     4|0|2|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - The 4 (largest tile) remains in the top-left corner, and the 2 is consolidated into the top row. This positions tiles for potential future merges (e.g., if a new 2 spawns next to the existing 2 in row 0).\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom to top.  \n   - Column 0: [4,0,0,0] → 4 shifts down to (3,0).  \n   - Column 2: [0,0,2,0] → 2 shifts down to (3,2).  \n   - Resulting board (before new tile):  \n     ```\n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     4|0|2|0  \n     ```  \n   - The 4 moves to the bottom-left corner, but this spreads tiles downward, making it harder to consolidate toward a single corner.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving **UP** consolidates the 4 (largest tile) in the top-left corner and positions the 2 in the top row, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and setting up for future merges. This is the most strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given game board. The goal is to position tiles for future merges and keep larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|2|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|2\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\nKey tiles: 4 (row 0, col 0), 2 (row 0, col 2), and 2 (row 2, col 3).\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left in each row.  \n   - Row 0: [4, 0, 2, 0] → [4, 2, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 2] → [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   Result: Tiles are spread out with no immediate merge potential. Larger tile (4) remains in row 0, col 0, but 2s are not positioned for easy merging.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right in each row.  \n   - Row 0: [4, 0, 2, 0] → [0, 0, 4, 2] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 2] → [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merge).  \n   Result: Tiles are pushed right, but 4 and 2s are not adjacent for merging. Larger tile (4) moves to row 0, col 2, which is not a corner.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up in each column.  \n   - Column 0: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Column 2: [2, 0, 0, 0] → [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: [0, 0, 2, 0] → [2, 0, 0, 0] (2 from row 2, col 3 moves up to row 0, col 3).  \n   Result: Row 0 becomes [4, 0, 2, 2]. The two 2s in row 0, cols 2-3 are adjacent horizontally, setting up for a future LEFT swipe to merge them into 4. The 4 remains in the top-left corner (a strategic position).\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down in each column.  \n   - Column 0: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (4 moves to row 3, col 0).  \n   - Column 2: [2, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 2] (2 moves to row 3, col 2).  \n   - Column 3: [0, 0, 2, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 2] (2 from row 2, col 3 moves to row 3, col 3).  \n   Result: Row 3 becomes [4, 0, 2, 2]. The two 2s in row 3, cols 2-3 are adjacent, but the 4 is moved to the bottom-left corner. While this is also a corner, the 2s are in the bottom row, which may be less optimal for immediate merging compared to the top row.\n\n\n### Optimal Move:\nSwiping UP positions the 4 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and aligns the two 2s in the top row (adjacent horizontally). This setup allows for a future LEFT swipe to merge the 2s into 4, creating a chain of merges. \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|0|2|2  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### 1. Swipe LEFT  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The 4 stays, the 0s are filled by shifting 2 and 2 left. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4). Result: 4|4|0|0.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left. The 2 shifts to the first position. Result: 2|0|0|0.  \n- Rows 2 and 3 remain unchanged (all 0s).  \n- After merging, the board has 4|4 in Row 0 (adjacent, ready to merge again in a future LEFT move) and 2 in Row 1, column 0 (easy to integrate into future moves).  \n\n\n### 2. Swipe RIGHT  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The 4 shifts to column 2, and the two 2s merge into 4 (score +4) in column 3. Result: 0|0|4|4.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right. The 2 stays in column 3. Result: 0|0|0|2.  \n- Rows 2 and 3 remain unchanged.  \n- While 4|4 in Row 0 (columns 2-3) can merge in a future RIGHT move, the 2 in Row 1, column 3 is less accessible for merging compared to the 2 in Row 1, column 0 after a LEFT move.  \n\n\n### 3. Swipe UP  \n- Columns are processed upward:  \n  - Column 0: 4 shifts to Row 0 (no merge).  \n  - Column 2: 2 shifts to Row 0 (no merge).  \n  - Column 3: 2 (Row 0) and 2 (Row 1) merge into 4 (Row 0, score +4).  \n- Resulting board: Row 0: 4|0|2|4; Rows 1-3: 0s.  \n- No adjacent mergable tiles in Row 0, limiting future scoring potential.  \n\n\n### 4. Swipe DOWN  \n- Columns are processed downward:  \n  - Column 0: 4 shifts to Row 3.  \n  - Column 2: 2 shifts to Row 3.  \n  - Column 3: 2 (Row 0) and 2 (Row 1) merge into 4 (Row 3, score +4).  \n- Resulting board: Row 3: 4|0|2|4; Rows 0-2: 0s.  \n- No adjacent mergable tiles in Row 3, limiting future scoring potential.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe LEFT move is optimal because it creates adjacent 4s in Row 0 (ready to merge into 8 in a future LEFT move) and positions the 2 in Row 1, column 0 for easier integration. This setup maximizes future scoring opportunities.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|4|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|2|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### 1. Swipe LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: The two adjacent 4s merge into 8 (score +8). The row becomes 8|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 1**: The 2 shifts left to the first position: 2|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 2**: The 2 shifts left to the first position: 2|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 3**: Remains empty.  \n\nResulting board after LEFT swipe (before new tile spawn):  \n8|0|0|0  \n2|0|0|0  \n2|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n\nThis move merges the 4s in Row 0, earning 8 points, and consolidates smaller tiles (2s) in the left column, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (top-left here).\n\n\n### 2. Swipe RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: The two 4s shift right and merge into 8 (score +8). The row becomes 0|0|8|0.  \n- **Row 1**: The 2 shifts right to the last position: 0|0|0|2.  \n- **Row 2**: The 2 shifts right to the last position: 0|0|0|2.  \n- **Row 3**: Remains empty.  \n\nResulting board after RIGHT swipe (before new tile spawn):  \n0|0|8|0  \n0|0|0|2  \n0|0|0|2  \n0|0|0|0  \n\nThis also merges the 4s for 8 points but places the 8 in the middle-right of Row 0, with 2s in the rightmost column. This is less optimal for corner consolidation.\n\n\n### 3. Swipe UP:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles (4, 2, 0, 0) shift up but do not merge (different values). Column becomes 4|2|0|0.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (4, 0, 2, 0) shift up but do not merge. Column becomes 4|2|0|0.  \n- Columns 2-3: Remain empty.  \n\nResulting board after UP swipe (before new tile spawn):  \n4|4|0|0  \n2|2|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n\nNo merges occur, so no score is earned. This move does not improve tile consolidation.\n\n\n### 4. Swipe DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles (4, 2, 0, 0) shift down to the bottom, resulting in 0|0|4|2.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (4, 0, 2, 0) shift down to the bottom, resulting in 0|0|4|2.  \n- Columns 2-3: Remain empty.  \n\nResulting board after DOWN swipe (before new tile spawn):  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n4|4|0|0  \n2|2|0|0  \n\nNo merges occur, so no score is earned. This move scatters tiles downward without strategic benefit.\n\n\n### Strategic Evaluation:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the 4s for 8 points, but LEFT consolidates the 8 in the top-left corner (a strong corner for future merges) and aligns 2s in the left column, enabling potential upward merges. RIGHT places the 8 in the middle-right, which is less optimal for corner-based strategies. UP and DOWN do not merge tiles and are suboptimal.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible swipe (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic placement of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 0 | 2 | 0  \nRow 1: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Each row shifts left, but no merges occur (non-zero tiles in rows 0-2 are [8,2], [2], [2], respectively, with no adjacent duplicates).  \n   - Result: No score gain; tiles shift left but remain unmerged.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Each row shifts right, but no merges occur (non-zero tiles in rows 0-2 are [8,2], [2], [2], respectively, with no adjacent duplicates).  \n   - Result: No score gain; tiles shift right but remain unmerged.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom.  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles [8, 2, 2, 0] shift up. The two 2s in rows 1 and 2 merge into a 4, resulting in [8, 4, 0, 0]. This merge gives a score of 4.  \n   - Other columns (1, 2, 3) have no merges.  \n   - Result: 8 remains in the top-left corner (row 0, column 0), and a merged 4 is placed in row 1, column 0. This maintains larger tiles in a corner, aligning with strategic goals.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom to top.  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles [8, 2, 2, 0] shift down. The two 2s in rows 2 and 3 merge into a 4, resulting in [0, 8, 4, 0]. This merge also gives a score of 4.  \n   - However, the 8 (originally in row 0, column 0) shifts down to row 1, column 0, moving it away from the corner.  \n\n### Strategic Choice:  \nUP is preferable because it keeps the largest tile (8) in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future merges. DOWN moves the 8 away from the corner, which is less optimal. LEFT and RIGHT do not merge any tiles, making them worse than UP and DOWN.  \n\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|2|0  \nRow 1: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|2|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: Tiles shift left → `8|2|0|0` (no merging).  \n- Row 1: Tiles shift left → `4|0|0|0` (no merging).  \n- Row 2: All zeros → remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n- Row 3: Tiles shift left → `2|0|0|0` (no merging).  \n**Result**: No merges. Poor for scoring.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: Tiles shift right → `0|0|8|2` (no merging).  \n- Row 1: Tiles shift right → `0|0|0|4` (no merging).  \n- Row 2: All zeros → remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n- Row 3: Tiles shift right → `0|0|0|2` (no merging).  \n**Result**: No merges.

LEFT  \n- **Row 0**: [8,0,4,0] shifts left to [8,4,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [4,0,0,0] shifts left to [4,0,0,0] (no change).  \n- **Row 2**: All zeros (no change).  \n- **Row 3**: [4,0,0,0] shifts left to [4,0,0,0] (no change).  \n- **Result**: No merges.

However, UP places the `16` in the top-left corner, a more strategic position for building larger tiles in a corner (a key strategy for 2048). LEFT and RIGHT do not merge any tiles and provide no score gain. Thus, UP is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes:\n\n### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **First row (16|0|4|4):** Tiles shift left. The 0s are filled by shifting tiles, so 16 stays, and the two 4s merge into 8 (score +8). Result: `16|8|0|0`.  \n- **Second row (0|0|2|0):** Tiles shift left, so 2 moves to the first position. Result: `2|0|0|0`.  \n- **Third and fourth rows (all 0s):** No change.  \n- **Outcome:** Merges the 4s, keeps 16 in the corner, and consolidates tiles leftward. Valid and strategic.  \n\n\n### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **First row (16|0|4|4):** Tiles shift right. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), and 16 shifts to the third column. Result: `0|0|16|8`.  \n- **Second row (0|0|2|0):** Tiles shift right, so 2 moves to the rightmost position. Result: `0|0|0|2`.  \n- **Third and fourth rows (all 0s):** No change.  \n- **Outcome:** Merges the 4s but moves 16 away from the corner, which is less strategic.  \n\n\n### **UP Swipe**  \n- Tiles shift upward. All non-zero tiles are already in the top rows (first and second rows), so no movement or merging occurs.  \n- **Outcome:** Invalid move (no tiles shift or merge).  \n\n\n### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- Tiles shift downward. The 16 in the first row moves to the bottom row, and smaller tiles (4, 2) spread out. No merging occurs.  \n- **Outcome:** Scatters tiles without merging, reducing strategic consolidation.  \n\n\nThe LEFT swipe is optimal: it merges the 4s for immediate score, keeps the largest tile (16) in the corner, and consolidates tiles leftward—key for long-term strategy.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (maximizing merges and positioning larger tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|8|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|2  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**:  \n- Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal numbers).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 16|8|0|0  \n  Row 1: 2|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 2|0|0|0  \n  ```  \n- No immediate merges, and the 16 (largest tile) stays in the top-left, but 2s are scattered in column 0 with no clear path to merge soon.\n\n#### **RIGHT**:  \n- Tiles shift right. Non-zero tiles move to the rightmost positions:  \n  - Row 0: [16,8,0,0] → [0,0,16,8] (16 and 8 shift right).  \n  - Row 1: [2,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,2] (2 shifts right).  \n  - Row 3: [0,0,0,2] → [0,0,0,2] (no change).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 0|0|16|8  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|2  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|2  \n  ```  \n- Key observation: Two 2s are now aligned vertically in column 3 (rows 1 and 3). Swiping UP next would merge these 2s into a 4 (scoring 4), which is a strategic setup for future merges.\n\n#### **UP**:  \n- Tiles shift up, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal numbers).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 16|8|0|2  \n  Row 1: 2|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n  ```  \n- The 16 stays in the top-left, but the 2 from row 3 shifts to row 0, scattering small tiles and limiting merge potential.\n\n#### **DOWN**:  \n- Tiles shift down, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal numbers).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 16|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 2|8|0|2  \n  ```  \n- The 16 moves to row 2, column 0, and 2s are scattered in row 3 with no clear merge path.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping **RIGHT** positions the two 2s vertically in column 3, enabling a merge in the next move (e.g., swiping UP). This aligns with strategic goals of setting up future merges and maintaining larger tiles (16 and 8) in the top-right, a strong corner position.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given game board:\n\n### Game Board\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|16|8\nRow 1: 0|0|0|2\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 2|0|0|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### 1. **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles `16` and `8` shift left to columns 0 and 1 (no merge, since 16 ≠ 8).

No movement or merging occurs. **Invalid move** (no tiles shift).\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward. Column 1 (32, 8, 4, 0) becomes [0, 32, 8, 4] (tiles shift down). Column 2 (8, 0, 0, 0) becomes [0, 0, 0, 8]. Other columns remain empty.

Importantly, this positions two 8s in column 4 (row 1 and row 2), setting up a potential merge (e.g., via UP in the next move).\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nRIGHT is preferred because it positions the 8s in column 4, creating an opportunity for merging in subsequent moves (e.g., swiping UP to merge the two 8s into 16).

The goal is to maximize score through merging and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 32 | 8  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 8  \nRow 2: 2 | 0 | 0 | 4  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles [0, 0, 32, 8] shift left to [32, 8, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [0, 0, 0, 8] shift left to [8, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [2, 0, 0, 4] shift left to [2, 4, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Remains [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Outcome**: No merges, so no score. Larger tiles (32, 8, 8) are scattered with no clear strategy.  \n\n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles [0, 0, 32, 8] are already right-aligned (no movement).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [0, 0, 0, 8] are already right-aligned (no movement).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [2, 0, 0, 4] shift right to [0, 0, 2, 4] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Remains [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Outcome**: Only minor movement in Row 2, no merges. No score, and larger tiles remain scattered.  \n\n\n#### 3. UP:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles [0, 0, 2, 0] shift up to [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: All zeros (no movement).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles [32, 0, 0, 0] remain [32, 0, 0, 0] (no movement).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles [8, 8, 4, 0] shift up: the two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), and the 4 shifts up to Row 1. Final column: [16, 4, 0, 0].  \n- **Resulting Board**:  \n  Row 0: 2 | 0 | 32 | 16  \n  Row 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 4  \n  Rows 2-3: All zeros.  \n- **Outcome**: Merges two 8s into 16 (score +16). Larger tiles (32, 16) are consolidated in the top row, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.  \n\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles [0, 0, 2, 0] shift down to [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: All zeros (no movement).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles [32, 0, 0, 0] shift down to [0, 0, 0, 32] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles [8, 8, 4, 0] shift down: the two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), and the 4 shifts down to Row 2. Final column: [0, 0, 4, 16].  \n- **Resulting Board**:  \n  Rows 0-1: All zeros.  \n  Row 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 4  \n  Row 3: 2 | 0 | 32 | 16  \n- **Outcome**: Merges two 8s into 16 (score +16). Larger tiles (32, 16) are in the bottom row, but this scatters them further from a corner compared to UP.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is optimal because it consolidates larger tiles (32, 16) in the top row, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner. This positions them for potential future merges and maintains more strategic flexibility. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) on the given game board, focusing on tile merging opportunities and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 2|0|32|16  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|4|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: [2, 0, 32, 16] → [2, 32, 16, 0] (no merges).  \n- Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 4] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- Row 3: [0, 4, 0, 0] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- Result: No merges. Larger tiles (32, 16) are not in a corner, and 4s are scattered.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: [2, 0, 32, 16] → [0, 2, 32, 16] (no merges).  \n- Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 4] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merges).  \n- Row 3: [0, 4, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merges).  \n- Result:  \n  - Larger tiles (32, 16) are positioned in the top row, right side (16 in the top-right corner).  \n  - Two 4s are now aligned vertically in column 3 (row 1 and row 3), creating a future merge opportunity if swiped down.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Column 0: [2, 0, 0, 0] → [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- Column 1: [0, 0, 0, 4] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- Column 3: [16, 4, 0, 0] → [16, 4, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- Result: No merges. 4s are scattered (row 0, column 1 and row 1, column 3), with no clear future merge potential.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Column 0: [2, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merges).  \n- Column 1: [0, 0, 0, 4] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merges).  \n- Column 2: [32, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 32] (no merges).  \n- Column 3: [16, 4, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 16, 4] (no merges).  \n- Result: No merges. Larger tiles (32, 16) are not in a corner, and 4s are scattered.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping RIGHT positions the largest tiles (32, 16) in the top row, right side (with 16 in the top-right corner), aligns 4s vertically in column 3 for future merging, and maintains strategic positioning for higher scores.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. The goal is to merge tiles strategically, ideally keeping larger tiles in a corner (e.g., bottom right) for future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|2|32|16  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|8|4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left in each row.

Merges occur in column 3 (two 4s merge into 8, scoring 8 points).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     Row 0: 0|2|32|16  \n     Row 1: 0|0|8|8  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   - Merged 8s in row 1, but large tiles (32, 16) remain in row 0, not positioned for future corner-based merges.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift downward. Merges occur in column 3 (two 4s merge into 8, scoring 8 points).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 0|0|32|16  \n     Row 3: 0|2|8|8  \n   - Large tiles (32, 16) are moved to row 2 (right side), and merged 8s are in row 3 (right side). This positions larger tiles in the bottom-right corner, aligning with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner for future merges (e.g., merging the 8s in row 3 next move).\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping DOWN positions large tiles (32, 16, 8, 8) in the bottom-right corner, enabling future strategic merges. This is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|2|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|32|16  \nRow 3: 0|2|8|8  \n\n\n### **LEFT Move Analysis**  \nWhen swiping LEFT, tiles shift to the left edge, and adjacent equal tiles merge:  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,2,0] → Shifts to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,0] → Remains [0,0,0,0] (no change).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,32,16] → Shifts to [32,16,0,0] (no merge, 32 and 16 are different).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,2,8,8] → Shifts to [2,8,8,0]. The two 8s merge into 16, resulting in [2,16,0,0] (score +16).  \n\n**Resulting Board After LEFT:**  \nRow 0: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 32|16|0|0  \nRow 3: 2|16|0|0  \n\nThis move merges the 8s in Row 3, scores 16, and positions larger tiles (32, 16) on the left edge, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.  \n\n\n### **RIGHT Move Analysis**  \nWhen swiping RIGHT, tiles shift to the right edge, and adjacent equal tiles merge:  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,2,0] → Shifts to [0,0,0,2] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,0] → Remains [0,0,0,0] (no change).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,32,16] → Shifts to [0,0,32,16] (no merge, 32 and 16 are different).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,2,8,8] → Shifts to [0,2,8,8]. The two 8s merge into 16, resulting in [0,0,2,16] (score +16).  \n\n**Resulting Board After RIGHT:**  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|32|16  \nRow 3: 0|0|2|16  \n\nThis move also merges the 8s but leaves larger tiles (32, 16) in the middle-right, less optimal for corner stacking.  \n\n\n### **UP Move Analysis**  \nWhen swiping UP, tiles shift upward, and adjacent equal tiles merge vertically:  \n- **Column 0**: All zeros → No change.  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,2] → Shifts to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 2**: [2,0,32,8] → Shifts to [2,32,8,0] (no merge, values are distinct).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,16,8] → Shifts to [16,8,0,0] (no merge, 16 and 8 are different).  \n\n**Resulting Board After UP:**  \nRow 0: 0|2|2|16  \nRow 1: 0|0|32|8  \nRow 2: 0|0|8|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\nNo merges occur, so no score is gained. This move scatters smaller tiles and does not optimize large tile placement.  \n\n\n### **DOWN Move Analysis**  \nWhen swiping DOWN, tiles shift downward, and adjacent equal tiles merge vertically:  \n- **Column 0**: All zeros → No change.  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,2] → Remains [0,0,0,2] (no merge).  \n- **Column 2**: [2,0,32,8] → Shifts to [0,2,32,8] (no merge, values are distinct).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,16,8] → Remains [0,0,16,8] (no merge, 16 and 8 are different).  \n\n**Resulting Board After DOWN:**  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|2|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|32|16  \nRow 3: 0|2|8|8  \n\nNo merges occur, so no score is gained. This move leaves the board nearly unchanged.  \n\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe LEFT move merges the 8s in Row 3 (scoring 16) and positions larger tiles (32, 16) on the left edge, aligning with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner for future merges. This is the most optimal choice.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 2 | 8 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 2 | 16 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT  \nTiles shift left, but no merges occur. All rows remain unchanged (e.g., Row 0: [2,8,0,0], Row 2: [32,16,0,0], etc.). No score gained.  \n\n#### 2. RIGHT  \nTiles shift right, but no merges occur. Rows become [0,0,2,8] (Row 0), [0,0,32,16] (Row 2), [0,0,2,16] (Row 3). No score gained.  \n\n#### 3. UP  \nTiles shift upward. Key changes occur in **Column 1**:  \n- Column 1 (original: [8,0,16,16]) shifts up to [8,16,16,0]. The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in [8,32,0,0].  \n- Column 0 (original: [2,0,32,2]) shifts up to [2,32,2,0] (no merges).  \nAfter UP, the board becomes:  \nRow 0: 2 | 8 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 32 | 32 | 0 | 0 (two 32s adjacent, setting up for a future merge)  \nRow 2: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nThis move gains 32 points and positions large tiles (32s) for potential future merges.  \n\n#### 4. DOWN  \nTiles shift downward. Key changes occur in **Column 1**:  \n- Column 1 (original: [8,0,16,16]) shifts down to [0,8,16,16]. The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32), resulting in [0,8,0,32].  \n- Column 0 (original: [2,0,32,2]) shifts down to [0,2,32,2] (no merges).  \nAfter DOWN, the board becomes:  \nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 2 | 8 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 32 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 2 | 32 | 0 | 0  \nThis move also gains 32 points but leaves fewer opportunities for immediate future merges compared to UP.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP is optimal because it merges two 16s into a 32 (gaining 32 points) and positions two 32s in the same row (Row 1), creating a strategic setup for future merges (e.g., swiping left next turn to merge the 32s into a 64).  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 8 | 16 | 0  \nRow 1: 32 | 32 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **UP Move**:  \n   Processing columns vertically, no adjacent tiles in any column are the same, and tiles are already as far up as possible. No tiles shift or merge. This is not a valid move.  \n\n2. **DOWN Move**:  \n   Tiles shift downward, but no adjacent tiles merge (e.g., column 0: [2, 32, 2, 0] becomes [0, 2, 32, 2]; column 1: [8, 32, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 8, 32]). No score is gained, and the board rearranges without meaningful merging.  \n\n3. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - Row 0: [2, 8, 16, 0] shifts right to [0, 2, 8, 16] (no merging).  \n   - Row 1: [32, 32, 0, 0] shifts right to [0, 0, 32, 32], which merges into [0, 0, 0, 64] (score +64).  \n   - Row 2: [2, 0, 0, 0] shifts right to [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n   The 64 tile ends up in the bottom-right corner.  \n\n4. **LEFT Move**:  \n   - Row 0: [2, 8, 16, 0] shifts left to [2, 8, 16, 0] (no merging).  \n   - Row 1: [32, 32, 0, 0] shifts left to [64, 0, 0, 0] (merges into 64, score +64).  \n   - Row 2: [2, 0, 0, 0] shifts left to [2, 0, 0, 0].  \n   The 64 tile ends up in the top-left corner, aligning with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in a corner for future merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nBoth LEFT and RIGHT merge the 32s into 64 (gaining 64 points). However, LEFT positions the 64 tile in the top-left corner, which is a strategic corner for future merges (e.g., potential future 64 tiles in row 1, column 0 can merge). This makes LEFT the better choice.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities and strategically position larger tiles, ideally in corners.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 8 | 16 | 0\nRow 1: 64 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift to the left in each row.  \n   - Row 0: `2 | 8 | 16 | 0` (no change, as tiles are already left-aligned).  \n   - Row 1: `64 | 0 | 0 | 0` (no change, 64 is left-aligned).  \n   - Row 2: `2 | 0 | 0 | 0` (no change, 2 is left-aligned).  \n   - Row 3: `8 | 0 | 0 | 0` (8 shifts left from column 3 to column 0).  \n   No merges occur, but the 64 (largest tile) remains in the top-left corner (row 1, column 0), a strategic corner position.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift to the right in each row.  \n   - Row 0: `0 | 2 | 8 | 16` (tiles shift right).  \n   - Row 1: `0 | 0 | 0 | 64` (64 shifts right to column 3).  \n   - Row 2: `0 | 0 | 0 | 2` (2 shifts right to column 3).  \n   - Row 3: `0 | 0 | 0 | 8` (no change, 8 is right-aligned).  \n   No merges occur, but the 64 moves from the top-left corner to the top-right corner (row 1, column 3), which is less optimal for future merging (as smaller tiles are spread across columns).\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward in each column.  \n   - Column 0: `2 | 64 | 2 | 0` → `2 | 64 | 2 | 0` (no merges, tiles shift up).  \n   - Column 1: `8 | 0 | 0 | 0` → `8 | 0 | 0 | 0` (no change).  \n   - Column 2: `16 | 0 | 0 | 0` → `16 | 0 | 0 | 0` (no change).  \n   - Column 3: `0 | 0 | 0 | 8` → `8 | 0 | 0 | 0` (8 shifts up to row 0, column 3).  \n   Resulting board:  \n   `Row 0: 2 | 8 | 16 | 8`  \n   `Row 1: 64 | 0 | 0 | 0`  \n   `Row 2: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0`  \n   `Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0`  \n   No merges occur, but the 64 remains in row 1, column 0 (top-left corner). However, row 0 now has two 8s (columns 1 and 3), separated by 16, which limits immediate merging potential.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward in each column.  \n   - Column 0: `2 | 64 | 2 | 0` → `0 | 2 | 64 | 2` (tiles shift down, no merges).  \n   - Column 1: `8 | 0 | 0 | 0` → `0 | 0 | 0 | 8` (8 shifts down to row 3, column 1).  \n   - Column 2: `16 | 0 | 0 | 0` → `0 | 0 | 0 | 16` (16 shifts down to row 3, column 2).  \n   - Column 3: `0 | 0 | 0 | 8` → `0 | 0 | 0 | 8` (no change).  \n   Resulting board:  \n   `Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0`  \n   `Row 1: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0`  \n   `Row 2: 64 | 0 | 0 | 0`  \n   `Row 3: 2 | 8 | 16 | 8`  \n   No merges occur, and the 64 moves to row 2, column 0 (not a corner), reducing strategic positioning.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions are valid (no merges occur), but **LEFT** is optimal. It keeps the largest tile (64) in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and consolidates tiles to the left, leaving empty spaces on the right for future moves. This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners to facilitate future merging.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to position tiles for future merges and keep larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2|8|16|0\nRow 1:64|0|0|0\nRow 2:2|0|32|0\nRow 3:8|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n   - Result: Tiles remain scattered with zeros on the right. No immediate or obvious future merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur.  \n   - Result: Tiles cluster on the right edge, but larger tiles (64, 32, 16, 8) are spread across different rows in the right column. No clear setup for future merges.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift up, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in columns).  \n   - Result: Larger tiles (64, 32) remain in the middle, with smaller tiles above and below. No strategic grouping.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down. Key observation: The 8 in Row 0, Column 1 (originally in Row 0, Column 1) shifts down to Row 3, Column 1. This positions two 8s in Row 3: one at Column 0 (original) and one at Column 1 (moved).  \n   - Result: Row 3 becomes `8|8|32|0`, with two adjacent 8s. This sets up a future LEFT swipe to merge these 8s into 16, generating score.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping DOWN positions two 8s in Row 3, Columns 0 and 1, creating a clear opportunity for a merge in the next move (e.g., a subsequent LEFT swipe). This aligns with the strategy of setting up future merges to maximize score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize score and position larger tiles strategically (e.g., in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2|0|0|0\nRow 1: 64|0|0|0\nRow 2: 2|0|16|4\nRow 3: 8|8|32|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n\n#### **LEFT Move**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left → `2|0|0|0` (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left → `64|0|0|0` (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left → `2|16|4|0` (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left → `16|32|0|0` (merges `8+8=16`, score +16).  \n- **Result**: 64 remains in the top-left corner. 16 and 32 are in row 3, but the right side of the grid has empty spaces.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Move**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right → `0|0|0|2` (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right → `0|0|0|64` (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right → `0|2|16|4` (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right → `0|0|32|16` (merges `8+8=16`, score +16).  \n- **Result**: 64 moves to the top-right corner (a strategic corner). 32 and 16 are in the bottom row, adjacent to 64’s column (column 3), creating potential for future merges (e.g., 16 + 16 → 32, then 32 + 32 → 64, aligning with 64 in the corner).  \n\n#### **UP Move**  \n- Columns are processed, but no adjacent tiles merge. Tiles shift up but no score is added. The board remains fragmented, with 64 in the top-left and 8, 16, 32 scattered.  \n\n#### **DOWN Move**  \n- Columns are processed, but no adjacent tiles merge. Tiles shift down but no score is added. The board structure remains similar to the original, with no strategic positioning of large tiles.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nBoth LEFT and RIGHT moves yield 16 points, but RIGHT is superior. Swiping RIGHT positions 64 in the top-right corner (a strategic corner) and aligns 32 and 16 in the bottom row, adjacent to 64’s column. This setup supports future merges (e.g., 16 + 16 → 32, then 32 + 32 → 64), maximizing long-term potential.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. The goal is to maximize merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|2\nRow 1: 4|0|0|64\nRow 2: 0|2|16|4\nRow 3: 0|0|16|32\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all non-zero tiles in each row are distinct).  \n   - Result: No score gain, and tiles are spread out with no strategic positioning.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (non-zero tiles in each row remain distinct).  \n   - Result: No score gain, and tiles remain scattered.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed upward. Column 2 (values `[0,0,16,16]`) merges the two 16s into a 32 (score +32).  \n   - Other columns (0, 1, 3) have no merges.  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 4|2|32|2  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|64  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|4  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|32  \n     ```  \n   - Larger tiles (32, 64) are spread across rows, which is suboptimal for corner-based strategy.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed downward. Column 2 (values `[0,0,16,16]`) merges the two 16s into a 32 (score +32).  \n   - Column 3 (values `[2,64,4,32]`) has no merges. Columns 0 and 1 shift tiles downward but no merges.  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|0|2  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|64  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|4  \n     Row 3: 4|2|32|32  \n     ```  \n   - Key advantage: The bottom row (Row 3) now has adjacent 32s (columns 2 and 3), which can merge into 64 with a subsequent RIGHT swipe. This positions larger tiles (64, 32s) in the right column, aligning with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe DOWN swipe merges the 16s for a score gain and positions the 32s adjacently in the bottom row, setting up for future merges. This is more strategic than other moves.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|2\nRow 1: 0|2|0|64\nRow 2: 0|0|0|4\nRow 3: 4|2|32|32\n```\n\n### 1. LEFT Swipe Analysis:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,0,2] → Shifts left to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).\n- **Row 1**: [0,2,0,64] → Shifts left to [2,64,0,0] (no merge).\n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,4] → Shifts left to [4,0,0,0] (no merge).\n- **Row 3**: [4,2,32,32] → Shifts left, and the two 32s merge into 64 → [4,2,64,0] (merge score: 64).\n\n### 2. RIGHT Swipe Analysis:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,0,2] → Stays [0,0,0,2] (no merge).\n- **Row 1**: [0,2,0,64] → Shifts right to [0,0,2,64] (no merge).\n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,4] → Stays [0,0,0,4] (no merge).\n- **Row 3**: [4,2,32,32] → Shifts right, and the two 32s merge into 64 → [0,4,2,64] (merge score: 64).\n\n### 3. UP Swipe Analysis:\n- **Column 0**: [0,0,0,4] → Shifts up to [4,0,0,0] (no merge).\n- **Column 1**: [0,2,0,2] → Shifts up, and the two 2s merge into 4 → [4,0,0,0] (merge score: 4).\n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,32] → Shifts up to [32,0,0,0] (no merge).\n- **Column 3**: [2,64,4,32] → No merges (distinct values).\n\n### 4. DOWN Swipe Analysis:\n- **Column 0**: [0,0,0,4] → Stays [0,0,0,4] (no merge).\n- **Column 1**: [0,2,0,2] → Shifts down, and the two 2s merge into 4 → [0,0,0,4] (merge score: 4).\n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,32] → Stays [0,0,0,32] (no merge).\n- **Column 3**: [2,64,4,32] → No merges (distinct values).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **LEFT and RIGHT** swipes yield the highest immediate score (64) from merging the 32s in Row 3.\n- **RIGHT swipe** places the merged 64 in the rightmost column (corner), aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners. This positions the 64 (Row 3, Column 3) adjacent to the existing 64 (Row 1, Column 3), potentially enabling future merges.\n- **LEFT swipe** places the merged 64 in Row 3, Column 2, which is less optimal for corner consolidation.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

All rows already have non-zero tiles as far right as possible (e.g., row 0: `[0,0,0,2]`; row 1: `[0,0,2,64]`). No tiles move or merge. **Invalid move** (no change).\n\n2. **LEFT Swipe**: Tiles shift left. \n   - Row 0: `[0,0,0,2]` → `[2,0,0,0]` (no merge).\n   - Row 1: `[0,0,2,64]` → `[2,64,0,0]` (no merge).\n   - Row 2: `[0,0,16,4]` → `[16,4,0,0]` (no merge).\n   - Row 3: `[0,4,2,64]` → `[4,2,64,0]` (no merge).  \n   Larger tiles (64s) move away from the right corner (e.g., row 1’s 64 shifts to column 1), reducing future merge potential. **Suboptimal**.\n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**: Tiles shift down. Columns are checked for movement:\n   - Column 0: All zeros. No change.\n   - Column 1: `[0,0,0,4]` → no movement (4 already at the bottom).\n   - Column 2: `[0,2,16,2]` → no movement (tiles blocked by others).\n   - Column 3: `[2,64,4,64]` → no movement (tiles blocked by others).  \n   No tiles move or merge. **Invalid move**.\n\n4. **UP Swipe**: Tiles shift up. Columns are checked for movement and merging:\n   - Column 0: All zeros. No change.\n   - Column 1: `[0,0,0,4]` → `[4,0,0,0]` (4 moves up to row 0).\n   - Column 2: `[0,2,16,2]` → `[2,16,2,0]` (2, 16, 2 shift up, no merge).\n   - Column 3: `[2,64,4,64]` → `[2,64,4,64]` (no merge, but tiles remain in place).  \n\n   After the up swipe, the board becomes:\n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|4|2|2\n   Row 1: 0|0|16|64\n   Row 2: 0|0|2|4\n   Row 3: 0|0|0|64\n   ```\n   Key advantages: \n   - Larger tiles (64s) remain in the right column (row 1, column 3 and row 3, column 3), preserving the corner strategy.\n   - Creates empty spaces on the left, allowing future flexibility.\n   - Sets up potential merges (e.g., row 0’s `2|2` could merge with a subsequent left swipe).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe is the best move, as it preserves large tiles in the corner and creates opportunities for future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges, strategically position larger tiles, and set up future opportunities.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|4|2|2  \nRow 1: 0|0|16|64  \nRow 2: 0|0|2|4  \nRow 3: 0|32|0|64  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [0,4,2,2] shift left. The two 2s merge into 4, resulting in [4,4,0,0] (score +4).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [0,0,16,64] shift left to [16,64,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [0,0,2,4] shift left to [2,4,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [0,32,0,64] shift left to [32,64,0,0] (no merge).  \n- Result: Larger tiles (16,64,32,64) shift left, but empty spaces are on the right. This scatters larger tiles, reducing future merge potential.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [0,4,2,2] shift right. The two 2s merge into 4, resulting in [0,4,4,0] (score +4).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [0,0,16,64] remain [0,0,16,64] (no merge, already right-aligned).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [0,0,2,4] remain [0,0,2,4] (no merge, already right-aligned).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [0,32,0,64] shift right to [0,0,32,64] (no merge).  \n- Result: Larger tiles (16,64,32,64) stay or shift right, clustering on the right edge. Empty spaces are on the left, where new tiles (2\/4) will spawn, preserving the right side for larger tiles. This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed upward. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. Larger tiles (32,16,64) become scattered, with no meaningful progress.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed downward. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. Larger tiles remain scattered, with no strategic benefit.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping **RIGHT** merges the 2s in Row 0, clusters larger tiles (16,64,32,64) on the right edge, and leaves empty spaces on the left (where new tiles spawn).

Result: [0,0,0,8]. Score +8.  \n   - Other rows (1-3) have no merges and remain mostly unchanged.  \n   **Resulting Board**:  \n   ```\n   0|0|0|8  \n   0|0|16|64  \n   0|8|2|4  \n   0|0|32|64  \n   ```  \n   This move only merges the 4s in Row 0 but leaves larger tiles scattered, limiting future merge opportunities.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns 0-3 are processed top-to-bottom. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles shift upward but remain unmerged.  \n   **Resulting Board**: No meaningful changes, no score.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns 0-3 are processed bottom-to-top. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles shift downward but remain unmerged.  \n   **Resulting Board**: No meaningful changes, no score.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT move merges the 4s in Row 0, aligns larger tiles to the left, and sets up potential future merges (e.g., 8s in Row 0 and Row 2).

The goal is to maximize merges, consolidate larger tiles in a corner, and set up future opportunities for higher-scoring combinations.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|8|0\nRow 1: 16|64|0|0\nRow 2: 8|4|4|0\nRow 3: 32|64|4|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Move**  \nTiles shift left, merging adjacent equal values:  \n- **Row 0**: [8, 0, 8, 0] → shifts to [8, 8, 0, 0] → merges into [16, 0, 0, 0] (score +16).  \n- **Row 1**: [16, 64, 0, 0] → shifts to [16, 64, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [8, 4, 4, 0] → shifts to [8, 4, 4, 0] → merges into [8, 8, 0, 0] (score +8).  \n- **Row 3**: [32, 64, 4, 0] → shifts to [32, 64, 4, 0] (no merges).  \n\n**Resulting Grid (before new tile)**:  \nRow 0: 16|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 16|64|0|0  \nRow 2: 8|8|0|0  \nRow 3: 32|64|4|0  \n\n**Key Benefits**:  \n- Merges 8s in Row 0 (into 16) and 4s in Row 2 (into 8).  \n- Larger tiles (32, 64, 16) are consolidated in the left column, setting up future merges (e.g., 16s in Row 0 and Row 1 can merge with a subsequent UP move).  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**  \nTiles shift right, merging adjacent equal values:  \n- **Row 0**: [8, 0, 8, 0] → shifts to [0, 0, 8, 8] → merges into [0, 0, 0, 16] (score +16).  \n- **Row 1**: [16, 64, 0, 0] → shifts to [0, 0, 16, 64] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [8, 4, 4, 0] → shifts to [0, 8, 4, 4] → merges into [0, 8, 8, 0] (score +8).  \n- **Row 3**: [32, 64, 4, 0] → shifts to [0, 32, 64, 4] (no merges).  \n\n**Resulting Grid (before new tile)**:  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 1: 0|0|16|64  \nRow 2: 0|8|8|0  \nRow 3: 0|32|64|4  \n\n**Key Drawback**:  \nLarger tiles (16, 64, 32) are spread across columns, reducing alignment for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP Move**  \nTiles shift up, merging adjacent equal values:  \n- **Column 0**: [8, 16, 8, 32] → no merges (all distinct).  \n- **Column 1**: [0, 64, 4, 64] → shifts to [64, 4, 64, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [8, 0, 4, 4] → shifts to [8, 4, 4, 0] → merges into [8, 8, 0, 0] (score +8).  \n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 0, 0] → no changes.  \n\n**Resulting Grid (before new tile)**:  \nRow 0: 8|64|8|0  \nRow 1: 16|4|8|0  \nRow 2: 8|64|0|0  \nRow 3: 32|0|0|0  \n\n**Key Drawback**:  \nLarger tiles (32, 64) are scattered, with limited alignment for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Move**  \nTiles shift down, merging adjacent equal values:  \n- **Column 0**: [8, 16, 8, 32] → no merges (all distinct).  \n- **Column 1**: [0, 64, 4, 64] → shifts to [0, 64, 4, 64] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [8, 0, 4, 4] → shifts to [0, 8, 4, 4] → merges into [0, 8, 0, 8] (score +8).  \n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 0, 0] → no changes.  \n\n**Resulting Grid (before new tile)**:  \nRow 0: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 16|64|8|0  \nRow 2: 8|4|0|0  \nRow 3: 32|64|8|0  \n\n**Key Drawback**:  \nLarger tiles (32, 64) are not consolidated into a corner, limiting future merge potential.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe LEFT move is optimal.

However, LEFT aligns tiles to the left, a common strategy to keep larger tiles (e.g., 32, 64) in a corner, facilitating future merges. RIGHT scatters tiles to the right, which is less strategic. UP and DOWN provide no score gain and do not improve board structure.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given 4x4 grid.

However, UP positions larger tiles (e.g., 128) in the top row, which aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners\/edges. Additionally, after UP, row 1 has [16,0,0,16], creating potential for future merges (e.g., swiping LEFT to merge the 16s). In contrast, DOWN leaves fewer adjacent equal tiles for future moves.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential, score gain, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 128 | 8 | 8\nRow 1: 16 | 0 | 0 | 16\nRow 2: 32 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 4 | 0\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). Result: `32 | 128 | 16 | 0`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left. The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). Result: `32 | 0 | 0 | 0`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left (no merges). Result: `32 | 0 | 0 | 0`.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left (no merges). Result: `4 | 0 | 0 | 0`.  \n**Total Score Gain**: 16 + 32 = 48.  \n**Outcome**: Larger tiles (32, 128) are positioned on the left, with empty spaces on the right. This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner (left) and leaving space for new tiles to spawn without disrupting them.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). Result: `0 | 32 | 128 | 16`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right. The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). Result: `0 | 0 | 0 | 32`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right (no merges). Result: `0 | 0 | 0 | 32`.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right (no merges). Result: `0 | 0 | 0 | 4`.  \n**Total Score Gain**: 16 + 32 = 48.  \n**Outcome**: Larger tiles (128, 32s) are on the right, but 128 is in the middle of the row, making it less stable compared to the left-aligned position in the LEFT move.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Columns**: No adjacent tiles merge. Tiles shift upward but remain unmerged.  \n**Result**: No score gain. Larger tiles are scattered, with no strategic advantage.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Columns**: No adjacent tiles merge. Tiles shift downward but remain unmerged.  \n**Result**: No score gain. Larger tiles are spread out, with no clear corner positioning.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 48 points, but LEFT positions larger tiles (32, 128) on the left edge, a strategic corner, and leaves empty spaces on the right for safe new tile spawning. This aligns better with the goal of maintaining large tiles in a corner and enabling future merges (e.g., 32s in column 0 can merge upward in subsequent moves).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 32 | 128 | 16 | 0  \nRow 1: 32 | 0 | 0 | 4  \nRow 2: 32 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Move**:  \n- Row 0: [32, 128, 16, 0] → Shifts left to [32, 128, 16, 0] (no merges).  \n- Row 1: [32, 0, 0, 4] → Shifts left to [32, 4, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- Rows 2-3: Tiles are already left-aligned (no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges, no score.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:  \n- Row 0: [32, 128, 16, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 32, 128, 16] (no merges).  \n- Row 1: [32, 0, 0, 4] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 32, 4] (no merges).  \n- Row 2: [32, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 0, 32] (no merges).  \n- Row 3: [4, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges, no score.  \n\n\n#### **UP Move**:  \nColumns are processed from top to bottom, merging adjacent equal tiles:  \n- **Column 0**: [32 (Row0), 32 (Row1), 32 (Row2), 4 (Row3)].  \n  - The first two 32s (Row0 and Row1) merge into 64 (score +64).  \n  - The next 32 (Row2) shifts up to Row1.  \n  - The 4 (Row3) shifts up to Row2.  \n  - Final Column 0: [64, 32, 4, 0].  \n- **Column 1**: [128 (Row0), 0, 0, 0] → No merges, remains [128, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 2**: [16 (Row0), 0, 0, 0] → No merges, remains [16, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 3**: [0 (Row0), 4 (Row1), 0, 0] → 4 shifts up to Row0. Final Column 3: [4, 0, 0, 0].  \n\n**Result**: Merges 32+32 in Column 0, earning 64 points.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Move**:  \nColumns are processed from bottom to top, but no adjacent equal tiles are aligned to merge:  \n- **Column 0**: [32, 32, 32, 4] → Tiles shift down but do not merge (no two adjacent equal tiles after shifting).  \n- Other columns: No merges (tiles are sparse and non-adjacent).  \n**Result**: No merges, no score.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe UP move merges two 32s into 64, earning 64 points, making it the best option.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging opportunities, and strategic positioning. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 64|128|16|4\nRow 1: 32|0|0|8\nRow 2: 4|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **UP**: Tiles shift upward. All tiles are already as high as possible (no empty spaces above them). No movement or merging occurs. This is an invalid move.  \n2. **LEFT**: Tiles shift left. Row 0 remains unchanged (no empty spaces to the left of tiles). Row 1 (32|0|0|8) becomes 32|8|0|0 (no merging). Row 2 (4|0|0|0) becomes 4|0|0|0 (no change). Row 3 remains 0s. No merging occurs, but tiles shift left. Valid but no score gain.  \n3. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right. Row 0 remains unchanged (tiles are already right-aligned). Row 1 (32|0|0|8) becomes 0|0|32|8 (no merging). Row 2 (4|0|0|0) becomes 0|0|0|4 (no merging). Row 3 remains 0s. No merging occurs, but tiles shift right. Valid but no score gain.  \n4. **DOWN**: Tiles shift downward. Each column is processed to shift tiles to the bottom:  \n   - Column 0 (64, 32, 4, 0) becomes (0, 64, 32, 4).  \n   - Column 1 (128, 0, 0, 0) becomes (0, 0, 0, 128).  \n   - Column 2 (16, 0, 0, 0) becomes (0, 0, 0, 16).  \n   - Column 3 (4, 8, 0, 0) becomes (0, 0, 4, 8).  \n\n   After moving down, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 64|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 32|0|0|4  \n   Row 3: 4|128|16|8  \n   ```  \n   No merging occurs (all adjacent tiles in the direction of movement are distinct), but tiles shift downward. This is a valid move.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe goal is to consolidate larger tiles in a corner for future merges. Moving DOWN shifts the larger tiles (64, 128) toward the bottom row, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner (e.g., bottom-left or bottom-right). This positions tiles to potentially merge in subsequent moves, whereas LEFT\/RIGHT keep larger tiles spread out in the top row, increasing the risk of blocking.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile positioning. The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities and keep larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|16\nRow 1: 64|0|0|0\nRow 2: 32|0|0|4\nRow 3: 4|128|16|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: [0,0,0,16] → Shifts to [16,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- Row 1: [64,0,0,0] → Shifts to [64,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- Row 2: [32,0,0,4] → Shifts to [32,4,0,0] (no merge).  \n- Row 3: [4,128,16,8] → Already left-aligned (no merge).  \n**Result**: No merges; large tiles (64, 128) remain scattered.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: [0,0,0,16] → Stays [0,0,0,16] (no merge).  \n- Row 1: [64,0,0,0] → Shifts to [0,0,0,64] (no merge).  \n- Row 2: [32,0,0,4] → Shifts to [0,0,32,4] (no merge).  \n- Row 3: [4,128,16,8] → Already right-aligned (no merge).  \n**Result**: No merges; large tiles (64, 128) remain scattered.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0** (0,64,32,4): Non-zero tiles (64,32,4) shift up → [64,32,4,0].  \n- **Column 1** (0,0,0,128): Only 128 shifts up → [128,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 2** (0,0,0,16): Only 16 shifts up → [16,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 3** (16,0,4,8): Non-zero tiles (16,4,8) shift up → [16,4,8,0].  \n\nAfter UP swipe, the board becomes:  \n```\nRow 0: 64|128|16|16  \nRow 1: 32|0|0|4  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|8  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n```  \n- **Key Observation**: The 64 (largest tile in column 0) moves to the top-left corner (0,0), a strategic corner position. Additionally, two 16s appear adjacent in Row 0 (columns 2 and 3), setting up potential future merges (e.g., swiping LEFT next could merge them into 32).  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0** (0,64,32,4): Non-zero tiles (64,32,4) remain in place (already shifted down) → [0,64,32,4].  \n- **Column 1** (0,0,0,128): 128 remains at the bottom → [0,0,0,128].  \n- **Column 2** (0,0,0,16): 16 remains at the bottom → [0,0,0,16].  \n- **Column 3** (16,0,4,8): Non-zero tiles (16,4,8) shift down → [0,16,4,8].  \n\nAfter DOWN swipe, the board becomes:  \n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 64|0|0|16  \nRow 2: 32|0|0|4  \nRow 3: 4|128|16|8  \n```  \n**Result**: No merges; large tiles (64, 128) remain in non-corner positions, with no clear setup for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe UP direction moves the 64 to the top-left corner (a strategic position) and positions two 16s adjacently in Row 0, creating opportunities for future merges. This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners and setting up for higher scores.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 128 | 16 | 16  \nRow 1: 32 | 0 | 16 | 4  \nRow 2: 4 | 0 | 0 | 8  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [64, 128, 16, 16] → Merges 16+16 into 32 → [64, 128, 32, 0].  \n   - Row 1: [32, 0, 16, 4] → Shifts left to [32, 16, 4, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [4, 0, 0, 8] → Shifts left to [4, 8, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Result: Larger tiles (64, 128, 32) stay in the top row, but the rightmost tile in row 0 becomes empty, limiting future merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [64, 128, 16, 16] → Merges 16+16 into 32 → [0, 64, 128, 32].  \n   - Row 1: [32, 0, 16, 4] → Shifts right to [0, 32, 16, 4] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [4, 0, 0, 8] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 4, 8] (no merges).  \n   - Result: Larger tiles (64, 128, 32) are spread across row 0, with empty space on the left, which is less strategic.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: [64, 32, 4, 0] → Shifts up to [64, 32, 4, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: [128, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts up to [128, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [16, 16, 0, 0] → Merges 16+16 into 32 → [32, 0, 0, 0].  \n   - Column 3: [16, 4, 8, 0] → Shifts up to [16, 4, 8, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Result: Merges 16s in column 2 into 32, keeping larger tiles (64, 128, 32) in the top row. This aligns with the strategy of concentrating larger tiles in a corner (top row) for future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: [64, 32, 4, 0] → Shifts down to [0, 64, 32, 4] (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: [128, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts down to [0, 0, 0, 128] (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [16, 16, 0, 0] → Merges 16+16 into 32 → [0, 0, 0, 32].  \n   - Column 3: [16, 4, 8, 0] → Shifts down to [0, 16, 4, 8] (no merges).  \n   - Result: Spreads larger tiles (64, 128, 32) across lower rows, reducing strategic positioning.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving **UP** merges the 16s in column 2 into 32, retains larger tiles (64, 128, 32) in the top row, and aligns with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and the goal of merging tiles for higher scores while arranging larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\n64|128|32|16\n32|64|0|4\n4|0|0|8\n0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles `64|128|32|16` have no zeros, so they remain unchanged.  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles `32|64|0|4` shift left, resulting in `32|64|4|0` (no merges).  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles `4|0|0|8` shift left, resulting in `4|8|0|0` (no merges).  \n   - **Row 4**: Remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n   No merges occur, but tiles in rows 2 and 3 shift closer to the left edge, potentially setting up future merges if adjacent tiles of the same value appear.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles `64|128|32|16` have no zeros, so they remain unchanged.  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles `32|64|0|4` shift right, resulting in `0|32|64|4` (no merges).  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles `4|0|0|8` shift right, resulting in `0|0|4|8` (no merges).  \n   - **Row 4**: Remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n   No merges occur, and tiles shift to the right edge, but this leaves more zeros on the left, which may not be as strategic for future merges.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed to shift tiles upward. However, all columns already have tiles packed with no gaps (e.g., column 1: `64|32|4|0` has no zeros between tiles), so no movement or merges occur. The board remains unchanged. This is ineffective as it wastes a move.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed to shift tiles downward. Tiles move to the bottom of each column, but no merges occur (e.g., column 1: `64|32|4|0` becomes `0|64|32|4`; column 2: `128|64|0|0` becomes `0|0|128|64`). The resulting board has empty top rows but no immediate benefit for merging.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nAll moves fail to produce merges, but **LEFT** is preferable. It shifts tiles in rows 2 and 3 closer to the left edge, reducing scattered empty spaces and potentially aligning tiles for future merges (e.g., if a new 4 or 8 spawns adjacent to existing tiles in row 3). UP is ineffective, and RIGHT\/DOWN leave tiles less aligned for strategic merging.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 1: 64|128|32|16\nRow 2: 32|64|4|0\nRow 3: 4|8|8|0\nRow 4: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 1**: All tiles are distinct and already shifted left; no merges.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles are `32|64|4|0`; shifting left moves `4` to the third position, no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles are `4|8|8|0`. Shifting left merges the two `8`s into `16` (score +16). The row becomes `4|16|0|0`.  \n- **Row 4**: All zeros; no change.  \n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 1**: All tiles are distinct and already shifted right; no merges.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles are `32|64|4|0`; shifting right moves `4` to the fourth position, no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles are `4|8|8|0`. Shifting right merges the two `8`s into `16` (score +16). The row becomes `0|0|4|16`.  \n- **Row 4**: All zeros; no change.  \n\n### UP Move:\n- **Column 1**: `64|32|4|0` (no merges, tiles already shifted up).  \n- **Column 2**: `128|64|8|0` (no merges, tiles already shifted up).  \n- **Column 3**: `32|4|8|0` (no merges, tiles already shifted up).  \n- **Column 4**: `16|0|0|0` (no merges, tiles already shifted up).  \nNo merges occur, so no score.  \n\n### DOWN Move:\n- **Column 1**: `64|32|4|0` shifts down to `0|64|32|4` (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: `128|64|8|0` shifts down to `0|128|64|8` (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: `32|4|8|0` shifts down to `0|32|4|8` (no merges).  \n- **Column 4**: `16|0|0|0` shifts down to `0|0|0|16` (no merges).  \nNo merges occur, so no score.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield a merge (score +16). However, LEFT consolidates the merged `16` in the third row's second position, keeping larger tiles (e.g., 128, 64) on the left side of the grid. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner to facilitate future merges. RIGHT places the merged `16` on the right, which is less beneficial for maintaining a consolidated structure.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up for future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 128 | 32 | 16  \nRow 1: 32 | 64 | 4 | 0  \nRow 2: 4 | 16 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur. The board remains unchanged. No score gained.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur. The board remains unchanged. No score gained.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Columns are processed top to bottom. In Column 0 (values: 64, 32, 4, 4), the two 4s in rows 2 and 3 merge into 8 (score +8). Other columns have no merges. The resulting board after UP is:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 64 | 128 | 32 | 16  \n   Row 1: 32 | 64 | 4 | 0  \n   Row 2: 8 | 16 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   ```  \n   This move creates an empty bottom row but does not set up significant future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Columns are processed bottom to top. In Column 0 (values: 64, 32, 4, 4), the two 4s in rows 2 and 3 merge into 8 (score +8). Other columns shift down but have no merges. The resulting board after DOWN is:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 1: 64 | 128 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 2: 32 | 64 | 32 | 0  \n   Row 3: 8 | 16 | 4 | 16  \n   ```  \n   Notably, Row 2 now has two 32s (columns 0 and 2). A subsequent LEFT swipe would merge these 32s into 64 (score +64), creating a strong setup for future high-value merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhile UP and DOWN both yield an 8-point merge, DOWN strategically positions two 32s in Row 2, enabling a high-value merge on the next move. This makes DOWN the better choice.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles.

This sets up a potential merge in the next move (e.g., swiping UP could merge these two 64s into 128, increasing the score).\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,0,0,64] → remains [0,0,0,64] (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: [64,128,0,0] → shifts right to [0,0,64,128] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [32,64,32,0] → shifts right to [0,32,64,32] (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: [8,16,4,16] → remains [8,16,4,16] (no merge).  \n\n   No strategic advantage; larger tiles (128) are not positioned to enable future merges.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns shift up, but no adjacent equal tiles merge. For example:  \n     - Column 0: [0,64,32,8] → shifts up to [64,32,8,0] (no merge).  \n     - Column 1: [0,128,64,16] → shifts up to [128,64,16,0] (no merge).  \n\n   No immediate or future merge opportunities are created.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns shift down, but no adjacent equal tiles merge. For example:  \n     - Column 0: [0,64,32,8] → shifts down to [0,64,32,8] (no merge).  \n     - Column 1: [0,128,64,16] → shifts down to [0,128,64,16] (no merge).  \n\n   No strategic positioning of larger tiles to enable future merges.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nLEFT is the best move because it aligns two 64s vertically (Row 0, Column 0 and Row 1, Column 0), creating a potential merge in the next move (e.g., swiping UP). This positions larger tiles in a corner (top-left) and sets up future scoring opportunities.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score through tile merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 64 | 128 | 0 | 64  \nRow 2: 32 | 64 | 32 | 0  \nRow 3: 8 | 16 | 4 | 16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles merge. All rows remain mostly unchanged (e.g., row 0: `64|0|0|0`; row 1: `64|128|64|0`).  \n   - **No score gain**.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 2: `32|64|32|0` shifts right, merging the two `32`s into `64` (score +64).  \n   - Other rows (e.g., row 1: `0|64|128|64`) have no merges.  \n   - **Score gain: 64**.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0 (vertical): `64` (row 0) and `64` (row 1) merge into `128` (score +128). The merged `128` shifts to row 0, with `32` (row 2) and `8` (row 3) shifting up to rows 1 and 2, respectively.  \n   - Other columns (e.g., column 1: `0|128|64|16` shifts to `128|64|16|0`) have no merges.  \n   - **Score gain: 128**.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0 (vertical): `64` (row 0) and `64` (row 1) merge into `128` (score +128), shifting to row 1. `32` (row 2) and `8` (row 3) remain in rows 2 and 3.  \n   - Other columns (e.g., column 1: `0|128|64|16` shifts to `0|128|64|16`) have no merges.  \n   - **Score gain: 128**, but large tiles (e.g., `128`s) end up in the middle row (row 1), which is less strategic than positioning them in the top row.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and DOWN yield a 128-point merge, but UP is better because it positions the merged `128` in the top row (row 0), aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners. This setup is more favorable for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize score through merges and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 128 | 32 | 64  \nRow 1: 32 | 64 | 4 | 16  \nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **UP\/DOWN Swipes**:  \n   - Swiping up or down does not result in any merges. All columns contain distinct numbers (no adjacent equal tiles), so tiles only shift without merging. These moves yield no score and do not improve tile positioning.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift right. The two 128s merge into 256 (score +256), resulting in `[0, 32, 64, 256]`.  \n   - Rows 1-3: No merges (tiles are distinct or already at the right edge).  \n   - The 256 tile is placed in the top-right corner.  \n\n3. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift left. The two 128s merge into 256 (score +256), resulting in `[256, 32, 64, 0]`.  \n   - Rows 1-3: No merges (tiles are distinct or already at the left edge).  \n   - The 256 tile is placed in the top-left corner.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:  \nThe key is to position larger tiles in a corner to facilitate future merges. Swiping left places the 256 tile (the new largest tile) in the top-left corner, a common strategic position to build a \"snake-like\" pattern of smaller tiles leading toward the corner. This setup allows for better control over future merges and reduces the risk of blocking larger tiles. Swiping right places the 256 in the top-right corner, but the top-left corner is more advantageous given the current tile distribution (smaller tiles are already on the left side of lower rows).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile alignment, and strategic positioning (keeping larger tiles in a corner).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 256 | 32 | 64 | 32  \nRow 1: 32 | 64 | 4 | 16  \nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n### Key Observations:\n- No adjacent tiles of the same value exist in any row or column, so **no merges occur in any direction**.  \n- The largest tile (256) is in the top-left corner (row 0, column 0), a strategic position to prioritize.  \n- The goal is to preserve this corner and align smaller tiles to enable future merges toward the corner.  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all tiles in rows are distinct).  \n   - The 256 remains in the top-left corner, and smaller tiles (32, 64, 32) stay in the top row, maintaining alignment for potential future merges toward the corner.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur.  \n   - The 256 remains in the top-left, but smaller tiles in the top row (32, 64, 32) shift right, creating empty spaces on the left. This could disrupt alignment for future corner-based merges.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift upward, but no merges occur.  \n   - Smaller tiles in columns (e.g., 32, 8, 2 in column 0) stack below the 256, which could block future merges toward the top-left corner.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift downward, but no merges occur.  \n   - Smaller tiles in columns (e.g., 32, 8, 2 in column 0) shift to the bottom, creating empty spaces at the top. This introduces unpredictability in where new tiles (2\/4) will spawn, potentially disrupting the corner strategy.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving **LEFT** preserves the 256 in the top-left corner and keeps smaller tiles aligned in the top row, maintaining the best setup for future merges toward the corner.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging rules.

Shifts right, resulting in [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n\n**Result**: One merge (16+16→32), score +32. However, the 8 in Row 2 moves right, disrupting the corner strategy.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed upward. All columns have distinct or non-adjacent tiles (e.g., Column 0: 256, 32, 8, 2; Column 1: 32, 64, 16, 0). No merges occur.  \n\n**Result**: No merges, no score gain.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed downward. All columns have distinct or non-adjacent tiles (e.g., Column 0: 256, 32, 8, 2; Column 1: 32, 64, 16, 0). No merges occur.  \n\n**Result**: No merges, no score gain.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both produce one merge (32 points), but LEFT preserves the 256 in the top-left corner (a strategic position). RIGHT disrupts tile placement by moving the 8 in Row 2 rightward. Thus, LEFT is optimal.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities while keeping larger tiles in a corner (here, the 256 tile is already in the top-left corner, which is desirable).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 256 | 32 | 64 | 32  \nRow 1: 32 | 64 | 4 | 16  \nRow 2: 8 | 32 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 2 | 0 | 0 | 4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal numbers).  \n   - Resulting board has no new adjacent equal tiles, leaving no immediate merging opportunities.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal numbers).  \n   - Resulting board also has no new adjacent equal tiles, similar to LEFT.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift up, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal numbers in columns).  \n   - Resulting board does not create new adjacent equal tiles for future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down. While no merges occur during this move, the resulting board sets up future merging opportunities:  \n     - Row 1 becomes `32 | 32 | 0 | 32` (two adjacent 32s in columns 0 and 1).  \n     - These adjacent 32s can merge into a 64 in the next move (e.g., swiping LEFT), creating a strategic advantage.  \n\n\nThe DOWN move is optimal because it positions two 32s adjacently in Row 1, enabling a merge in the next move.

Valid moves depend on shifting tiles into empty spaces.\n\n### Evaluation of Directions\n\n#### LEFT\n- **Row 0**: [256, 2, 64, 0] (64 shifts left into the empty space, no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [64, 32, 0, 0] (no movement).\n- **Row 2**: [8, 128, 16, 0] (no movement).\n- **Row 3**: [2, 32, 8, 0] (no movement).  \n  Result: No merges. 256 remains in the top-left corner, but 64 shifts to Row 0, Column 2. Limited strategic improvement.\n\n#### RIGHT\n- **Row 0**: [0, 256, 2, 64] (256 shifts right from Column 0 to Column 1, losing its corner position).\n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 64, 32] (64 and 32 shift right).\n- **Row 2**: [0, 8, 128, 16] (8, 128, 16 shift right).\n- **Row 3**: [0, 2, 32, 8] (2, 32, 8 shift right).  \n  Result: No merges. 256 moves away from the corner, which is strategically poor.\n\n#### UP\n- **Column 0**: [256, 64, 8, 2] (no movement, all tiles filled).\n- **Column 1**: [2, 32, 128, 32] (no movement, all tiles filled).\n- **Column 2**: [16, 8, 0, 0] (16 and 8 shift up into empty spaces).\n- **Column 3**: [64, 0, 0, 0] (no movement, 64 remains in Row 0).  \n  Result: No merges. 256 stays in the top-left corner, but 64 remains in Row 0, Column 3 with limited strategic benefit.\n\n#### DOWN\n- **Column 0**: [256, 64, 8, 2] (no movement, all tiles filled).\n- **Column 1**: [2, 32, 128, 32] (no movement, all tiles filled).\n- **Column 2**: [0, 0, 16, 8] (no movement, 16 and 8 remain in Rows 2 and 3).\n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 0, 64] (64 shifts down from Row 0, Column 3 to Row 3, Column 3, a corner position).  \n  Result: No merges, but 64 moves to the bottom-right corner. This positions two large tiles (256 in top-left and 64 in bottom-right) in corners, which is strategically optimal for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion\nDOWN is the best move. It keeps the largest tile (256) in the top-left corner and moves 64 to the bottom-right corner, maintaining a strategic corner-based layout for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score, create future merge opportunities, and keep large tiles in corners.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 256 | 2 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 0 | 64  \nRow 2: 8 | 128 | 16 | 0  \nRow 3: 2 | 32 | 8 | 64  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Each row shifts left, but no adjacent tiles merge (all non-zero tiles are distinct or separated by zeros). No score gain. Unfavorable.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Each row shifts right, but no adjacent tiles merge (non-zero tiles remain distinct or separated by zeros). No score gain. Unfavorable.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- Tiles shift upward, and columns are processed for merges:  \n  - **Column 3**: Original tiles [0, 64, 0, 64] shift up to [64, 64, 0, 0]. The two 64s merge into 128, adding 128 to the score.  \n  - Other columns (0, 1, 2) have no merges but shift tiles upward.  \n- Resulting board after UP:  \n  Row 0: 256 | 2 | 16 | 128  \n  Row 1: 64 | 32 | 8 | 0  \n  Row 2: 8 | 128 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 3: 2 | 32 | 0 | 0  \n- Key advantage: 256 (largest tile) remains in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and empty spaces are distributed to allow future moves.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles shift downward, and columns are processed for merges:  \n  - **Column 3**: Original tiles [0, 64, 0, 64] shift down to [0, 0, 64, 64]. The two 64s merge into 128, adding 128 to the score.  \n  - Other columns (0, 1, 2) have no merges but shift tiles downward.  \n- Resulting board after DOWN:  \n  Row 0: 2 | 2 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 1: 8 | 32 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 2: 64 | 128 | 16 | 0  \n  Row 3: 256 | 32 | 8 | 128  \n- Disadvantage: 256 (largest tile) moves to the bottom-left corner, disrupting the top-left corner strategy.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP is preferred because it keeps the largest tile (256) in the top-left corner, a strategic position, while still merging two 64s into 128 for score.

LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: [8, 0, 256, 2] → Shifts left to [8, 256, 2, 0] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [0, 64, 32, 64] → Shifts left to [64, 32, 64, 0] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [0, 8, 128, 16] → Shifts left to [8, 128, 16, 0] (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: [2, 32, 16, 128] → No zeros, so no shift (no merges).\n- **Outcome**: Tiles consolidate to the left, creating empty spaces on the right (Row 0-2, Column 3). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles (e.g., 256, 128) in a corner (right side) and leaves room for future merges.\n\n#### 2. RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: [8, 0, 256, 2] → Shifts right to [0, 8, 256, 2] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [0, 64, 32, 64] → No shift (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [0, 8, 128, 16] → No shift (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: [2, 32, 16, 128] → No zeros, so no shift (no merges).\n- **Outcome**: Minimal tile movement, with only Row 0 shifting right. This leaves fewer empty spaces and does not meaningfully consolidate tiles.\n\n#### 3. UP Move:\n- **Column 0**: [8, 0, 0, 2] → Shifts up to [8, 2, 0, 0] (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [0, 64, 8, 32] → Shifts up to [64, 8, 32, 0] (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: [256, 32, 128, 16] → No shift (no merges).\n- **Column 3**: [2, 64, 16, 128] → No shift (no merges).\n- **Outcome**: Tiles shift upward, but large tiles (256, 128) are scattered, reducing corner consolidation.\n\n#### 4. DOWN Move:\n- **Column 0**: [8, 0, 0, 2] → Shifts down to [0, 0, 8, 2] (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [0, 64, 8, 32] → Shifts down to [0, 0, 64, 32] (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: [256, 32, 128, 16] → No shift (no merges).\n- **Column 3**: [2, 64, 16, 128] → No shift (no merges).\n- **Outcome**: Tiles shift downward, but large tiles (256, 128) remain scattered, and empty spaces are created in the top rows, which are less strategic.\n\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nThe LEFT move consolidates tiles to the left, creating empty spaces on the right (a corner-adjacent area). This positions larger tiles (256, 128) near the right side, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners and leaving room for future merges. Other moves either scatter large tiles or create fewer strategic empty spaces.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up for future merges, prioritizing keeping larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 256 | 2 | 0\nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 64 | 32\nRow 2: 8 | 128 | 16 | 0\nRow 3: 2 | 32 | 16 | 128\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   - Swiping LEFT or RIGHT does not result in any merges. All rows are already filled with non-zero tiles (or have zeros that do not allow adjacent merges). No score is gained, and the board structure remains largely unchanged. These moves are suboptimal.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - Column 2 (tiles: 2, 64, 16, 16) has two adjacent 16s. Swiping UP merges these 16s into a 32, adding 32 points.  \n   - Column 3 (tiles: 0, 32, 0, 128) shifts upward, moving 32 to row 0 and 128 to row 1. This moves the 128 from its corner position (row 3, col 3) to row 1, col 3, which is less ideal for future merges.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 2 (tiles: 2, 64, 16, 16) also has two adjacent 16s. Swiping DOWN merges these 16s into a 32, adding 32 points (same as UP).  \n   - Column 3 (tiles: 0, 32, 0, 128) shifts downward, keeping the 128 in its original corner position (row 3, col 3). This preserves a large tile in a corner, which is strategically valuable.  \n   - Additionally, after swiping DOWN, row 3 becomes `2 | 32 | 32 | 128`, with two adjacent 32s. This sets up a potential future merge (e.g., swiping LEFT next turn would merge these 32s into a 64).\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping DOWN is optimal. It retains the 128 in the corner, provides an immediate 32-point merge, and sets up adjacent 32s in row 3 for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential merges and resulting board states for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

The goal is to identify the direction that maximizes score through merging and strategically positions larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 256 | 4 | 32\nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 64 | 128\nRow 2: 8 | 128 | 32 | 0\nRow 3: 2 | 32 | 0 | 8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \nTiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row to merge. For example:  \n- Row 0: `8, 256, 4, 32` (all distinct).  \n- Row 1: `64, 32, 64, 128` (64s are separated by 32).  \n- Row 2: `8, 128, 32, 0` (no merges).  \n- Row 3: `2, 32, 0, 8` (no merges).  \n**No merges or score gain.**\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nTiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row to merge. For example:  \n- Row 0: `8, 256, 4, 32` (all distinct).  \n- Row 1: `64, 32, 64, 128` (64s are separated by 32).  \n- Row 2: `8, 128, 32, 0` (no merges).  \n- Row 3: `2, 32, 0, 8` (no merges).  \n**No merges or score gain.**\n\n#### **UP**  \nTiles shift up, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column to merge. For example:  \n- Column 0: `8, 64, 8, 2` (8s are separated by 64).  \n- Column 1: `256, 32, 128, 32` (32s are separated by 128).  \n- Column 2: `4, 64, 32, 0` (no merges).  \n- Column 3: `32, 128, 0, 8` (no merges).  \n**No merges or score gain.**\n\n#### **DOWN**  \nTiles shift down, and two key merges occur:  \n1. **Column 0**: `8 (row0), 64 (row1), 8 (row2), 2 (row3)`.  \n   - The 8s in row0 and row2 are aligned vertically. When shifting down, these 8s merge into 16, adding 16 to the score.  \n2. **Column 1**: `256 (row0), 32 (row1), 128 (row2), 32 (row3)`.  \n   - The 32s in row1 and row3 are aligned vertically. When shifting down, these 32s merge into 64, adding 64 to the score.  \n\n**Total score gain: 16 + 64 = 80.**\n\n### Conclusion:  \nDOWN is the only direction with valid merges, resulting in a significant score increase.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize immediate merges and position larger tiles strategically (e.g., in corners) for future moves.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 256 | 0 | 32\nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 4 | 32\nRow 2: 8 | 128 | 64 | 128\nRow 3: 2 | 32 | 32 | 8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left → `8 | 256 | 32 | 0` (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left → `64 | 32 | 4 | 32` (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left → `8 | 128 | 64 | 128` (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left → `2 | 64 | 8 | 0` (merges 32 and 32 into 64, +64 points).  \n- **Outcome**: Only one merge (64 points). Larger tiles (256, 128) remain scattered.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right → `8 | 256 | 32 | 0` (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right → `64 | 32 | 4 | 32` (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right → `8 | 128 | 64 | 128` (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right → `0 | 2 | 64 | 8` (merges 32 and 32 into 64, +64 points).  \n- **Outcome**: Only one merge (64 points). Larger tiles (256, 128) remain scattered.  \n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift up → `8 | 64 | 8 | 2` (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles shift up → `256 | 32 | 128 | 32` (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles shift up → `4 | 64 | 32 | 0` (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles shift up → `64 | 128 | 8 | 0` (merges 32 and 32 into 64, +64 points).  \n- **Outcome**: One merge (64 points). Larger tiles (256, 128) stay in the top\/middle rows, with empty spaces in the bottom row (ideal for future tile spawns).  \n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles shift down → `8 | 64 | 8 | 2` (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles shift down → `256 | 32 | 128 | 32` (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles shift down → `0 | 32 | 64 | 4` (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles shift down → `0 | 64 | 128 | 8` (merges 32 and 32 into 64, +64 points).  \n- **Outcome**: One merge (64 points). Larger tiles (256, 128) remain scattered, with empty spaces in the top row (less ideal for future moves).  \n\n\n### Key Observations:  \nAll moves yield 64 points from merging 32s. However, **UP** is optimal because:  \n- It positions the 256 (largest tile) in the top row, a strategic corner-adjacent position.  \n- Empty spaces are created in the bottom row, minimizing interference with larger tiles.  \n- The merged 64 in the top-right corner (row 0, column 3) supports future corner-based growth.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic positioning of tiles.\n\n### LEFT\n- **Row 0**: [8, 256, 4, 64] – All distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 1**: [64, 32, 64, 128] – All distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 2**: [8, 128, 32, 8] – All distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 3**: [2, 32, 32, 0] – The two 32s merge into 64. Score: 64.\n\n### RIGHT\n- **Row 0**: [8, 256, 4, 64] – All distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 1**: [64, 32, 64, 128] – All distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 2**: [8, 128, 32, 8] – All distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 3**: [2, 32, 32, 0] – The two 32s merge into 64 (shifted right). Score: 64.\n\n### UP\n- **Column 0**: [8, 64, 8, 2] – All distinct; no merges.\n- **Column 1**: [256, 32, 128, 32] – All distinct; no merges.\n- **Column 2**: [4, 64, 32, 32] – The two 32s (row 2 and 3) merge into 64. This new 64 (row 2) then merges with the existing 64 (row 1) to form 128. Score: 64 (from 32+32) + 128 (from 64+64) = 192.\n- **Column 3**: [64, 128, 8, 0] – All distinct; no merges.\n\n### DOWN\n- **Column 0**: [8, 64, 8, 2] – All distinct; no merges.\n- **Column 1**: [256, 32, 128, 32] – All distinct; no merges.\n- **Column 2**: [4, 64, 32, 32] – The two 32s (row 2 and 3) merge into 64 (shifted down). Score: 64.\n- **Column 3**: [64, 128, 8, 0] – All distinct; no merges.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe UP direction yields the highest score (192) due to two consecutive merges in column 2. Additionally, merging larger tiles (64 → 128) aligns with the strategy of building higher-value tiles.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score through tile merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 256 | 4 | 64\nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 64 | 128\nRow 2: 8 | 128 | 64 | 8\nRow 3: 2 | 32 | 4 | 0\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The only adjacent tiles with the same value are the two `64`s in Column 2 (Row 1 and Row 2). Merging these would yield a `128` and add 128 to the score.\n- Other tiles are distinct or non-adjacent, so no merges occur in LEFT or RIGHT swipes.\n\n\n### Direction Evaluation:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipes**:  \n   No merges occur in these directions. Tiles shift but remain distinct, resulting in no score gain. These are suboptimal.\n\n2. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 2 (Row 1 and Row 2) contains two `64`s. When swiping UP, these merge into a `128` at Row 1, Column 2. The `4` from Row 3, Column 2 shifts up to Row 2, Column 2.  \n   - Resulting board after UP:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 8 | 256 | 4 | 64  \n     Row 1: 64 | 32 | 128 | 128  (two adjacent 128s in Row 1)  \n     Row 2: 8 | 128 | 4 | 8  \n     Row 3: 2 | 32 | 0 | 0  (two empty tiles)  \n     ```  \n   - This creates a strategic advantage: the adjacent `128`s in Row 1 can be merged in a subsequent LEFT swipe, yielding a `256`.\n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 2 (Row 1 and Row 2) also contains two `64`s. When swiping DOWN, these merge into a `128` at Row 2, Column 2. The `4` from Row 0, Column 2 shifts down to Row 1, Column 2.  \n   - Resulting board after DOWN:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 8 | 256 | 0 | 64  \n     Row 1: 64 | 32 | 4 | 128  \n     Row 2: 8 | 128 | 128 | 0  (two adjacent 128s in Row 2)  \n     Row 3: 2 | 32 | 4 | 8  \n     ```  \n   - While this also merges the `64`s, the adjacent `128`s in Row 2 are less strategically positioned compared to Row 1 (closer to the top where the largest tile, `256`, resides).\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is optimal because it merges the `64`s in Column 2 (yielding 128 points) and positions two `128`s in Row 1, which can be merged in a subsequent LEFT swipe to form a `256`. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and enabling future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges and position tiles strategically for future moves.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 256 | 4 | 64\nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 128 | 128\nRow 2: 8 | 128 | 4 | 8\nRow 3: 2 | 32 | 0 | 64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Columns are processed top to bottom. No adjacent tiles in any column are the same, and no empty spaces allow meaningful shifts. No merges occur.  \n\n2. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Columns are processed bottom to top. No adjacent tiles in any column are the same, and no empty spaces allow meaningful shifts. No merges occur.  \n\n3. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Rows are processed left to right.  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles (8, 256, 4, 64) are all distinct; no merges.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles (64, 32, 128, 128) have adjacent 128s. Merging them gives 256, with the row becoming (64, 32, 256, 0). Score +256.  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles (8, 128, 4, 8) are distinct; no merges.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles (2, 32, 0, 64) shift left to (2, 32, 64, 0). No merges.  \n\n4. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Rows are processed right to left.  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles (8, 256, 4, 64) are all distinct; no merges.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles (64, 32, 128, 128) have adjacent 128s. Merging them gives 256, with the row becoming (0, 64, 32, 256). Score +256.  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles (8, 128, 4, 8) are distinct; no merges.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles (2, 32, 0, 64) shift right to (0, 2, 32, 64). No merges.  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\n- Only LEFT and RIGHT swipes result in a merge (128 + 128 = 256 in Row 1).  \n- After a LEFT swipe, the merged 256 in Row 1, Column 2 is diagonally adjacent to the existing 256 in Row 0, Column 1. This positions larger tiles closer together, potentially enabling future merges.  \n- After a RIGHT swipe, the merged 256 in Row 1, Column 3 is farther from the existing 256 in Row 0, Column 1, reducing the likelihood of future merges.  \n\n\nThe LEFT swipe is more strategic as it aligns larger tiles (256s) closer together, improving long-term merging potential. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 256 | 4 | 64  \nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 256 | 16  \nRow 2: 8 | 128 | 4 | 8  \nRow 3: 2 | 32 | 64 | 0  \n\n### Key Observations:\n- No adjacent tiles in any row or column have the same value, so no immediate merges are possible.  \n- The only empty tile (0) is in Row 3, Column 3. Valid moves must involve shifting tiles into this empty space.  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows are fully occupied with distinct values. Shifting left will not merge any tiles or move tiles (no empty spaces to fill). No change occurs.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 3 (2 | 32 | 64 | 0) will shift right, moving 2, 32, 64 to the rightmost positions. Row 3 becomes 0 | 2 | 32 | 64.  \n   - No merges occur, but the 64 (a larger tile) is placed in the bottom-right corner (Row 3, Column 3).  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are fully occupied with distinct values. Shifting up will not merge any tiles or move tiles (no empty spaces to fill). No change occurs.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 3 (64 | 16 | 8 | 0) will shift down, moving the 8 (Row 2, Column 3) into the empty space (Row 3, Column 3). Row 2, Column 3 becomes 0, and Row 3, Column 3 becomes 8.  \n   - No merges occur, but the 8 (smaller tile) is placed in the bottom-right corner (Row 3, Column 3), leaving an empty space in Row 2, Column 3.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe goal is to position larger tiles in corners for future merges. Moving RIGHT places the 64 (a larger tile) in the bottom-right corner (Row 3, Column 3), which aligns with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in corners. However, the 8 in Row 2, Column 3 (after moving DOWN) could potentially merge with other 8s in future moves if they shift into adjacent positions. Despite this, the 64 in the corner is more valuable for long-term strategy.  \n\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile alignment. The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 256 | 4 | 64\nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 256 | 16\nRow 2: 8 | 128 | 4 | 8\nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Each row is processed leftward. No adjacent tiles in any row are equal, so no merges occur. Tiles remain in their original positions as the grid is full (no empty spaces to shift into).  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row is processed rightward. Similar to LEFT, no adjacent tiles in any row are equal, and the grid is full, so no merges or shifts occur. Tiles remain unchanged.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed upward. Checking columns:  \n     - Column 0: [8, 64, 8, 32] (no adjacent equals).  \n     - Column 1: [256, 32, 128, 2] (no adjacent equals).  \n     - Column 2: [4, 256, 4, 32] (no adjacent equals).  \n     - Column 3: [64, 16, 8, 64] (no adjacent equals).  \n   - No merges occur, but upward movement aligns larger tiles (e.g., 256 in row 0, column 1) toward the top, which is a strategic corner for larger tiles.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed downward. Similar to UP, no adjacent tiles in any column are equal, and the grid is full. Tiles remain unchanged, with larger tiles shifting away from the top corner.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhile no merges are possible in any direction, the UP move strategically aligns larger tiles (e.g., 256 in row 0, column 1) toward the top, a common strategy to keep larger tiles in a corner for future merges. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges and valid shifts in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same value. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 256 | 4 | 64  \nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 256 | 16  \nRow 2: 8 | 128 | 4 | 8  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 64  \n\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles [8, 256, 4, 64] are all unique; no merges.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles [64, 32, 256, 16] are all unique; no merges.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles [8, 128, 4, 8] have 8s in columns 0 and 3, but they are not adjacent after shifting left (no zeros to allow movement); no merges.  \n   - Row 3: Tiles [32, 2, 32, 64] have 32s in columns 0 and 2, but they are not adjacent after shifting left (no zeros to allow movement); no merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles [8, 256, 4, 64] are all unique; no merges.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles [64, 32, 256, 16] are all unique; no merges.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles [8, 128, 4, 8] have 8s in columns 0 and 3, but they are not adjacent after shifting right (no zeros to allow movement); no merges.  \n   - Row 3: Tiles [32, 2, 32, 64] have 32s in columns 0 and 2, but they are not adjacent after shifting right (no zeros to allow movement); no merges.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: Tiles [8, 64, 8, 32] have 8s in rows 0 and 2, but they are not adjacent after shifting up (no zeros to allow movement); no merges.  \n   - Column 1: Tiles [256, 32, 128, 2] are all unique; no merges.  \n   - Column 2: Tiles [4, 256, 4, 32] have 4s in rows 0 and 2, but they are not adjacent after shifting up (no zeros to allow movement); no merges.  \n   - Column 3: Tiles [64, 16, 8, 64] have 64s in rows 0 and 3, but they are not adjacent after shifting up (no zeros to allow movement); no merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: Tiles [8, 64, 8, 32] have 8s in rows 0 and 2, but they are not adjacent after shifting down (no zeros to allow movement); no merges.  \n   - Column 1: Tiles [256, 32, 128, 2] are all unique; no merges.  \n   - Column 2: Tiles [4, 256, 4, 32] have 4s in rows 0 and 2, but they are not adjacent after shifting down (no zeros to allow movement); no merges.  \n   - Column 3: Tiles [64, 16, 8, 64] have 64s in rows 0 and 3, but they are not adjacent after shifting down (no zeros to allow movement); no merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied with no adjacent tiles of the same value. By the rules, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we choose **LEFT** (arbitrarily, as no direction offers a valid merge).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate potential merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to identify a move that allows merging tiles to increase the score.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 256 | 4 | 64  \nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 256 | 16  \nRow 2: 8 | 128 | 4 | 8  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 64  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows have distinct adjacent tiles (no same numbers in sequence). For example, Row 3 (32, 2, 32, 64) has 32s separated by 2, so no merge.  \n   - **Result**: No merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Similar to LEFT, all rows have distinct adjacent tiles. For example, Row 2 (8, 128, 4, 8) has 8s separated by 128 and 4, so no merge.  \n   - **Result**: No merges.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - All columns have distinct adjacent tiles. For example, Column 0 (8, 64, 8, 32) has 8s separated by 64, so no merge.  \n   - **Result**: No merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 3 (64, 16, 8, 64) contains two 64s (row 0 and row 3). When moving DOWN, the top 64 (row 0) shifts down past 16 (row 1) and 8 (row 2) to merge with the bottom 64 (row 3).  \n   - **Merge**: 64 (row 0) + 64 (row 3) → 128 (row 3).  \n   - **Score**: 128.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only valid merge occurs with a DOWN swipe, where the two 64s in Column 3 merge into 128. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges and valid moves. The game board is:\n\n```\n8|256|4|64  \n64|32|256|16  \n8|128|4|8  \n32|2|32|64  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **No Empty Tiles**: All tiles are filled (no 0s), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent or movable same-numbered tiles.\n2. **Adjacent Tiles**: Checking all horizontal and vertical adjacent tiles reveals no pairs of the same number. For example:\n   - Row 0: 8, 256, 4, 64 (all distinct).\n   - Row 1: 64, 32, 256, 16 (all distinct).\n   - Row 2: 8, 128, 4, 8 (8s are non-adjacent).\n   - Row 3: 32, 2, 32, 64 (32s are non-adjacent).\n   - Columns: Similarly, no adjacent same numbers (e.g., column 0: 8, 64, 8, 32; 8s are non-adjacent).\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Tiles cannot shift left or right because there are no empty spaces. Non-adjacent same-numbered tiles (e.g., 32s in row 3, 8s in row 2) cannot merge as they are separated by distinct tiles.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Tiles cannot shift up or down for the same reason (no empty spaces). Non-adjacent same-numbered tiles (e.g., 8s in column 0, 4s in column 2) remain separated by distinct tiles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full with no adjacent same-numbered tiles, there are no valid moves to merge or shift tiles. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid merges, any direction is technically invalid, but a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to identify merges and strategic positioning of tiles. The current game board is full (no empty tiles), so valid moves require adjacent merges or tile shifts. Here's the analysis:\n\n### LEFT Move\n- **Row 0**: [8, 256, 4, 64]  \n  All tiles are distinct. No merges.  \n- **Row 1**: [64, 32, 256, 16]  \n  All tiles are distinct. No merges.  \n- **Row 2**: [8, 128, 4, 8]  \n  Tiles are distinct. No merges.  \n- **Row 3**: [32, 2, 32, 64]  \n  - Shift left: Tiles shift to [32, 32, 2, 64] (removing gaps).  \n  - Merge: The two 32s merge into 64 (score +64).  \n  - Final row: [64, 2, 64, 0] (with a new empty tile at column 3).  \n\n### RIGHT Move\n- All rows have distinct tiles. No merges or shifts that create merges.  \n\n### UP Move\n- All columns have distinct tiles. No merges or shifts that create merges.  \n\n### DOWN Move\n- All columns have distinct tiles. No merges or shifts that create merges.  \n\nThe only move that results in a merge is **LEFT**, where the two 32s in Row 3 merge into 64, creating an empty tile and scoring 64. This move also aligns larger tiles for potential future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles. The grid is currently full (no empty tiles), so valid moves require adjacent equal tiles that can merge or tiles that can shift into empty spaces (though there are no empty spaces here). The key is to identify if any direction allows merging or sets up future merges.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 256 | 4 | 64\nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 256 | 16\nRow 2: 8 | 128 | 4 | 8\nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Each row is processed left. All rows are full with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and tiles do not shift. No score or grid change.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row is processed right. All rows are full with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and tiles do not shift. No score or grid change.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Each column is processed up. All columns are full with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and tiles do not shift. No score or grid change.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Each column is processed down. All columns are full with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and tiles do not shift. No score or grid change.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions result in no immediate merges or tile shifts, as the grid is full with no adjacent equal tiles. However, strategic positioning (e.g., keeping larger tiles in corners) is a long-term goal. Among the options, **DOWN** is chosen as a plausible direction to potentially align larger tiles (e.g., 256s, 128) for future merges, even if no immediate benefit is observed.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify a direction that allows merging tiles to increase the score, as merging is the primary way to score points and avoid game over.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 256 | 4 | 64  \nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 256 | 16  \nRow 2: 8 | 128 | 4 | 8  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 64  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles are [8, 256, 4, 64].

The 64s are separated by 16 and 8; no adjacency, so no merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same value. According to the rules, a valid move requires either adjacent same tiles or empty spaces to shift tiles into. Since neither condition is met, there are no valid moves.

Shifting down will not merge any tiles.  \n   - Example: Column 3 `[64, 16, 8, 64]` remains unchanged; no merges.  \n\n4. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 3 `[32, 2, 32, 64]` is critical. When shifting right:  \n     - Tiles shift to the right, and the two `32`s (originally in columns 0 and 2) become adjacent in columns 1 and 2 after shifting.  \n     - These `32`s merge into `64` (score +64).  \n     - The resulting `64`s (now in columns 2 and 3) then merge into `128` (score +128).  \n   - This direction enables two merges, significantly increasing the score.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT allows merging the `32`s in Row 3 into `64`, followed by merging the `64`s into `128`, making it the most strategic move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of merging adjacent tiles of the same value and maximizing score. The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 256 | 4 | 64\nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 256 | 16\nRow 2: 8 | 128 | 4 | 8\nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 32 | 64\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The grid is **completely full** (no empty tiles, 0s). Valid moves require either merging adjacent tiles of the same value or shifting into empty spaces. Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend solely on merging adjacent tiles in the direction of the swipe.\n- No adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. For example:\n  - Row 0: All tiles (8, 256, 4, 64) are distinct.\n  - Row 1: All tiles (64, 32, 256, 16) are distinct.\n  - Row 2: Tiles (8, 128, 4, 8) have 8s, but they are not adjacent (separated by 128 and 4).\n  - Row 3: Tiles (32, 2, 32, 64) have 32s, but they are not adjacent (separated by 2).\n  - Columns also have no adjacent duplicates (e.g., column 2 has 4, 256, 4, 32, but the 4s are separated by 256).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipes**: No adjacent tiles in rows can merge, and the grid is full, so no tiles shift. Invalid.\n- **UP\/DOWN Swipes**: No adjacent tiles in columns can merge, and the grid is full, so no tiles shift. Invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere are no valid moves (no adjacent merges possible, no empty spaces to shift into). However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we default to a direction that aligns with strategic goals (e.g., consolidating larger tiles in a corner, though no merges occur here). \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and grid dynamics.

Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend solely on merging adjacent tiles.\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All rows are fully occupied with distinct values (no adjacent duplicates). For example:  \n   - Row 0: [8, 256, 4, 64] (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [64, 32, 256, 16] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [8, 128, 4, 8] (8s are non-adjacent).  \n   - Row 3: [32, 2, 32, 64] (32s are non-adjacent).  \n   No merges or shifts occur. **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Similar to LEFT, all rows are fully occupied with no adjacent duplicates. Tiles cannot shift right (no empty spaces), and no merges occur. **Invalid move**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   All columns are fully occupied. Checking columns:  \n   - Column 0: [8, 64, 8, 32] (8s are non-adjacent).  \n   - Column 1: [256, 32, 128, 2] (all distinct).  \n   - Column 2: [4, 256, 4, 32] (4s are non-adjacent).  \n   - Column 3: [64, 16, 8, 64] (64s are non-adjacent).  \n   No merges or shifts occur. **Invalid move**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Columns remain fully occupied, with no adjacent duplicates. Tiles cannot shift down (no empty spaces), and no merges occur. **Invalid move**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent tiles of the same value, meaning no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the most plausible choice (despite no merges) is **UP**, as it aligns with strategic patterns (e.g., consolidating larger tiles in corners).\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges and strategic positioning.

Swiping right shifts tiles right but does not merge any tiles. No score is gained.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - All columns have distinct adjacent tiles (no two same numbers are adjacent).

Swiping down shifts tiles down but does not merge any tiles. No score is gained.  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\nThe grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number in any direction. This means no immediate merges are possible. However, the game allows swiping even if no merges occur, as long as tiles can shift (though in this case, tiles are already fully packed). Since the epoch is 92 (8 epochs remaining), the goal is to choose a direction that minimally disrupts tile positioning to allow future merges. Given the lack of immediate merges, any direction is technically valid, but strategically, **LEFT** is chosen as a neutral move that maintains tile alignment for potential future shifts.\n\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile alignment.

At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n8|256|4|64\n64|32|256|16\n8|128|4|8\n32|2|32|64\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

We need to evaluate how each direction shifts these tiles and positions them for future merges.\n\n#### 1. Swipe LEFT:\n- Row 0: [0,0,0,2] → shifts to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).\n- Row 2: [0,2,0,0] → shifts to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).\n- Resulting board after LEFT: 2s at (0,0) and (2,0) (same column, vertically separated).  \n- No immediate merge, but tiles are in column 0.\n\n#### 2. Swipe RIGHT:\n- Row 0: [0,0,0,2] → remains [0,0,0,2] (already rightmost).\n- Row 2: [0,2,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,2] (no merge).\n- Resulting board after RIGHT: 2s at (0,3) and (2,3) (same column, vertically separated).  \n- Tiles are in column 3, a corner-aligned column, which aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners.\n\n#### 3. Swipe UP:\n- Column 1: [0,0,2,0] → shifts 2 to (0,1).\n- Column 3: [2,0,0,0] → 2 remains at (0,3).\n- Resulting board after UP: 2s at (0,1) and (0,3) (same row, horizontally separated).  \n- No immediate merge, and tiles are spread across the row.\n\n#### 4. Swipe DOWN:\n- Column 1: [0,0,2,0] → shifts 2 to (3,1).\n- Column 3: [2,0,0,0] → shifts 2 to (3,3).\n- Resulting board after DOWN: 2s at (3,1) and (3,3) (same row, horizontally separated).  \n- No immediate merge, and tiles are spread across the row.\n\n### Strategic Evaluation:\nThe key is to position tiles for future merges. Swiping RIGHT places both 2s in column 3 (same column, rows 0 and 2). This setup allows for a potential merge in the next move by swiping UP, as the 2s would shift upward and become adjacent in the column, merging into a 4. This aligns with the strategy of clustering tiles in a corner column to facilitate merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given game board. The goal is to merge tiles strategically, preferably moving larger tiles into a corner for future merges.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|2|2\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|2\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [0,0,2,2] shift left, merging the two 2s into 4. Result: [4,0,0,0].  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [0,0,0,2] shift left to [2,0,0,0].  \n- **Resulting Board (before new tile)**:  \n  Row 0: 4|0|0|0  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 2|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n- The 4 is in the top-left corner, but the 2 is below it, leaving limited immediate merge potential.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [0,0,2,2] shift right, merging the two 2s into 4. Result: [0,0,0,4].  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [0,0,0,2] remain at [0,0,0,2] (already right-aligned).  \n- **Resulting Board (before new tile)**:  \n  Row 0: 0|0|0|4  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|2  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n- The 4 is in the top-right corner, but the 2 is below it, with no immediate adjacency for merging.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles [2 (row0), 0 (row1), 2 (row2), 0 (row3)] shift up, merging the two 2s into 4. Result: [4,0,0,0] (top of column 3).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles [2 (row0), 0 (row1), 0 (row2), 0 (row3)] shift up to [2,0,0,0] (top of column 2).  \n- **Resulting Board (before new tile)**:  \n  Row 0: 0|0|2|4  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n- The 4 is in the top-right corner, and the 2 is adjacent to it in the top row, but the top row is less strategic for long-term merges.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles [2 (row0), 0 (row1), 2 (row2), 0 (row3)] shift down, merging the two 2s into 4. Result: [0,0,0,4] (bottom of column 3).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles [2 (row0), 0 (row1), 0 (row2), 0 (row3)] shift down to [0,0,0,2] (bottom of column 2).  \n- **Resulting Board (before new tile)**:  \n  Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 0|0|2|4  \n- The 4 is in the bottom-right corner (a strategic corner for building larger tiles), and the 2 is adjacent to it in the bottom row, creating a favorable setup for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe DOWN swipe merges two 2s into a 4, places the 4 in the bottom-right corner (a key strategic position), and positions a 2 adjacent to it in the bottom row. This setup maximizes the potential for future merges and aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and rules:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|2|4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **RIGHT**:  \n   Moving right shifts tiles to the right edge. For all rows:  \n   - Row 0: All zeros (no change).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,2] is already right-aligned (no change).  \n   - Row 2: All zeros (no change).  \n   - Row 3: [0,0,2,4] is already right-aligned (no change).  \n   The board remains unchanged, so RIGHT is **invalid**.\n\n2. **DOWN**:  \n   Moving down shifts tiles to the bottom edge. For all columns:  \n   - Columns 0-1: All zeros (no change).  \n   - Column 2: [0,0,0,2] (tile at row 3) is already bottom-aligned (no change).  \n   - Column 3: [0,2,0,4] (tiles at rows 1 and 3) are already bottom-aligned (no change).  \n   The board remains unchanged, so DOWN is **invalid**.\n\n3. **LEFT**:  \n   Moving left shifts tiles to the left edge. For all rows:  \n   - Row 0: All zeros (no change).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,2] → [2,0,0,0] (shifts left).  \n   - Row 2: All zeros (no change).  \n   - Row 3: [0,0,2,4] → [2,4,0,0] (shifts left).  \n   The board changes, so LEFT is **valid**. However, the 4 (originally in row 3, column 3) moves to row 3, column 1, which is not a corner.\n\n4. **UP**:  \n   Moving up shifts tiles to the top edge. For all columns:  \n   - Columns 0-1: All zeros (no change).  \n   - Column 2: [0,0,0,2] → [2,0,0,0] (shifts to row 0).  \n   - Column 3: [0,2,0,4] → [2,4,0,0] (shifts to rows 0 and 1).  \n   The resulting board is:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|2|2  \n   Row 1: 0|0|0|4  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   This move is **valid**. The 4 (originally in row 3, column 3) moves to row 1, column 3 (top-right corner), and two 2s are now adjacent in row 0 (columns 2-3), setting up for a potential merge in the next move (e.g., LEFT). This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner and creating merge opportunities.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move, as it positions the 4 in a corner and creates adjacent 2s for future merging.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|2|2  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|4  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### 1. Swipe LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4). Row 0 becomes: 4|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left. 2 moves to column 0, 4 to column 1. No merges. Row 1 becomes: 2|4|0|0.  \n- Rows 2 and 3 remain unchanged (all 0s).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  4|0|0|0  \n  2|4|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n- Key outcome: Merges occur, and larger tiles (4) are consolidated in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future moves.  \n\n\n### 2. Swipe RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4). Row 0 becomes: 0|0|0|4.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right. 2 moves to column 2, 4 to column 3. No merges. Row 1 becomes: 0|0|2|4.  \n- Rows 2 and 3 remain unchanged (all 0s).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  0|0|0|4  \n  0|0|2|4  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n- Key outcome: Merges occur, but larger tiles (4) are placed in the top-right corner, which is less central for future consolidation.  \n\n\n### 3. Swipe UP:\n- Columns are processed top to bottom.  \n  - Column 0: [0,2,0,0] → 2 shifts to row 0.  \n  - Column 1: [0,0,0,0] → No change.  \n  - Column 2: [2,0,0,0] → 2 shifts to row 0.  \n  - Column 3: [2,4,0,0] → 2 stays in row 0, 4 in row 1 (no merge).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  2|0|2|2  \n  0|0|0|4  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n- Key outcome: No merges, only tile movement.  \n\n\n### 4. Swipe DOWN:\n- Columns are processed bottom to top.  \n  - Column 0: [0,2,0,0] → 2 shifts to row 3.  \n  - Column 1: [0,0,0,0] → No change.  \n  - Column 2: [2,0,0,0] → 2 shifts to row 3.  \n  - Column 3: [2,4,0,0] → 2 shifts to row 2, 4 to row 3 (no merge).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|0  \n  0|0|0|2  \n  2|0|2|4  \n- Key outcome: No merges, only tile movement.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both trigger a merge (score +4), but LEFT consolidates the 4 in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future merges. UP and DOWN do not merge any tiles. Thus, LEFT is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, potential merges, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|0|0\nRow 1: 2|4|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|2|0|0\n```\nThe goal is to position tiles to enable future merges and keep larger tiles in a corner.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: `[4,0,0,0]` → shifts to `[4,0,0,0]` (no change).  \n   - Row 1: `[2,4,0,0]` → shifts to `[2,4,0,0]` (no change).  \n   - Row 3: `[0,2,0,0]` → shifts to `[2,0,0,0]`.  \n   - Result: No merges. Tiles remain scattered, with 4s in (0,0) and (1,1), which limits future merges.  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: `[4,0,0,0]` → shifts to `[0,0,0,4]`.  \n   - Row 1: `[2,4,0,0]` → shifts to `[0,0,2,4]`.  \n   - Row 3: `[0,2,0,0]` → shifts to `[0,0,0,2]`.  \n   - Result: No merges. 4s are in (0,3) and (1,3) (right column), but they are not adjacent, limiting future merges.  \n\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: `[4,2,0,0]` → shifts to `[4,2,0,0]` (no merge).  \n   - Column 1: `[0,4,0,2]` → shifts to `[4,2,0,0]` (4 from row 1 moves to row 0, 2 from row 3 moves to row 1).  \n   - Result:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 4|4|0|0  \n     Row 1: 2|2|0|0  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - Key observation: 4s in row 0 (columns 0 and 1) and 2s in row 1 (columns 0 and 1) become adjacent. This positions tiles for future left\/right merges (e.g., a left move would merge the 4s into 8 and 2s into 4, generating score).  \n\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: `[4,2,0,0]` → shifts to `[0,0,4,2]` (4 from row 0 moves to row 2, 2 from row 1 moves to row 3).  \n   - Column 1: `[0,4,0,2]` → shifts to `[0,0,4,2]` (4 from row 1 moves to row 2, 2 from row 3 stays).  \n   - Result:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 4|4|0|0  \n     Row 3: 2|2|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - Similar to UP, 4s and 2s are adjacent, but they are in lower rows (row 2 and 3). While this also enables future merges, the top rows (row 0 and 1) are empty, which is less strategic than keeping larger tiles in upper rows.  \n\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nMoving UP positions the 4s and 2s in the top rows (row 0 and 1), adjacent to each other. This sets up for immediate merges in the next move (e.g., a left swipe would merge the 4s into 8 and 2s into 4). Keeping larger tiles in the top rows aligns with the strategy of cornering larger tiles for future growth.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential, score gain, and strategic tile placement.\n\n### LEFT Move Analysis:\n- **Row 1 (4|4|2|0):** Tiles shift left. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), and the 2 moves to the next available spot. Result: 8|2|0|0.\n- **Row 2 (2|2|0|0):** Tiles shift left. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4). Result: 4|0|0|0.\n- **Rows 3-4:** All zeros, no change.  \n**Total Score Gain:** 8 + 4 = 12.  \n**Resulting Board:**  \n8|2|0|0  \n4|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \nLarger tiles (8, 4) are consolidated in the top-left corner, a strategic position.\n\n\n### RIGHT Move Analysis:\n- **Row 1 (4|4|2|0):** Tiles shift right.

Swiping up causes no movement or merging. This is not a valid move, as no tiles shift.\n\n\n### DOWN Move Analysis:\nTiles shift down, but no merging occurs (e.g., 4 and 2 in columns 1 and 2 are not equal). The board becomes:  \n0|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n4|4|0|0  \n2|2|2|0  \nNo score gain, and the tile arrangement is less consolidated compared to LEFT\/RIGHT.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 12 points, but LEFT consolidates larger tiles in the top-left corner, a more strategic position for future merges. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning.

Tiles are clustered in the top rows but not strategically positioned for future merges.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles in each column shift down.  \n   - Column 0: `0|0|8|4` (8 and 4 shift to rows 2 and 3).  \n   - Column 1: `0|0|0|2` (2 shifts to row 3).  \n   - Column 2: `0|0|0|2` (2 shifts to row 3).  \n   - Column 3: `0|0|0|0` (no change).  \n   - **Result After Shifting**:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 8|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 4|2|2|0  \n     ```  \n   - **Key Observation**: The two 2s in Row 3 (columns 1 and 2) are now adjacent horizontally. This positions them for a potential merge in the next move (e.g., a subsequent LEFT swipe would merge these 2s into a 4, generating score).  \n\n### Strategic Rationale:  \nThe DOWN swipe groups the smaller tiles (2s) into adjacent positions in the bottom row, setting up future merges.

It merges the two `2`s in Row 3 into a `4` (score +4), consolidates larger tiles (2, 8, 4) in the left column (a strategic corner), and sets up future merges (e.g., merging the new `4`s in Row 3 into an `8`).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

Result: `[8,0,0,0]` (score +8).  \n\n   After the left swipe (before adding a new tile), the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 2|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 8|2|0|0  \n   Row 3: 8|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   This positions larger tiles (8s) in the left column, aligning them vertically for potential future merges (e.g., swiping up could merge the 8s in Row 2 and Row 3).\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: All zeros, no change.  \n   - **Row 1**: `[2,0,0,0]` shifts right to `[0,0,0,2]` (no merge).  \n   - **Row 2**: `[8,0,0,2]` shifts right to `[0,0,8,2]` (no merge, as 8 and 2 differ).  \n   - **Row 3**: `[4,4,0,0]` shifts right, merging the two 4s into 8.

The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain. This is not optimal.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth left and right swipes merge the 4s in Row 3, yielding 8 points. However, the left swipe positions the 8s in the left column, aligning them vertically for potential future merges (e.g., swiping up could merge the 8s in Row 2 and Row 3). This strategic alignment is more favorable for building higher tiles.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes, focusing on merging tiles and positioning larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|2|0|0\nRow 1: 2|0|0|0\nRow 2: 8|2|0|0\nRow 3: 8|0|0|0\n```\n\n### LEFT Swipe:\n- Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row).  \n- Result: No score gain, minimal tile rearrangement. **Not optimal.**\n\n### RIGHT Swipe:\n- Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row).  \n- Result: No score gain, minimal tile rearrangement. **Not optimal.**\n\n### UP Swipe:\n- Process columns top-to-bottom:  \n  - **Column 0 (0, 2, 8, 8):** Tiles shift up → [2, 8, 8, 0].

UP also leaves more empty space in lower rows, providing flexibility for future moves.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, positioning large tiles in corners, and setting up future merges).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 2 | 4 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 4  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     Row 0: 2 | 4 | 0 | 0  \n     Row 1: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n     Row 2: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 (4 from row 2, column 3 shifts left)  \n     Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   - No score gain.

The 4s in row 3 (columns 1 and 3) are now in the same row, making them adjacent after a future LEFT swipe (they would shift to columns 1 and 2, allowing a merge into 8). This positions tiles for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move, as it consolidates the largest tile (16) in a corner and aligns 4s in the same row for potential future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping large tiles in a corner).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 2|0|0|8\nRow 3: 16|4|0|4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0 & 1**: All zeros; no change.\n- **Row 2**: [2,0,0,8] shifts left to [2,8,0,0] (no merge, as 2 and 8 are different).\n- **Row 3**: [16,4,0,4] shifts left. The two 4s merge into 8, resulting in [16,8,0,0].

This arrangement is strategically better for future merges and maintaining tile concentration.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to position tiles for future merges while keeping larger tiles in a corner for strategic advantage.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 2|0|0|0\nRow 3: 32|16|0|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [4,0,0,0] → [4,0,0,0] (no change, no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,0] (no change).  \n   - Row 2: [2,0,0,0] → [2,0,0,0] (no change, no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [32,16,0,8] → [32,16,8,0] (tiles shift left; 32, 16, 8 are aligned consecutively in columns 0-2, no merges).  \n   - Outcome: Larger tiles (32, 16, 8) are aligned in the bottom row, leaving column 3 empty. This positions them for potential future merges (e.g., 8+8, 16+16, 32+32) if new tiles spawn in column 3.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [4,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,4] (4 shifts right, no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,0] (no change).  \n   - Row 2: [2,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,2] (2 shifts right, no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [32,16,0,8] → [0,32,16,8] (tiles shift right; 32, 16, 8 are spread across columns 1-3, no merges).  \n   - Outcome: Larger tiles are shifted away from the bottom-left corner, reducing strategic positioning for future merges.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0 (4,0,2,32) → [4,2,32,0] (tiles shift up, no merges).  \n   - Column 1 (0,0,0,16) → [16,0,0,0] (16 shifts up, no merges).  \n   - Column 3 (0,0,0,8) → [8,0,0,0] (8 shifts up, no merges).  \n   - Outcome: Tiles (4, 16, 8) are spread across the top row, making future merges less likely.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0 (4,0,2,32) → [0,4,2,32] (tiles shift down, no merges).  \n   - Column 1 (0,0,0,16) → [0,0,0,16] (no change).  \n   - Column 3 (0,0,0,8) → [0,0,0,8] (no change).  \n   - Outcome: Tiles (4, 2) are scattered in the middle rows, with 32, 16, 8 in the bottom row but not aligned consecutively.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping LEFT aligns the largest tiles (32, 16, 8) consecutively in the bottom row, keeping them in the bottom-left corner (a strategic position) and creating opportunities for future merges. This is the best move.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential, strategic positioning of large tiles, and future move setup.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|2|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 2|0|0|0\nRow 3: 32|16|8|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [4,2,0,0] → Shifts left to [4,2,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,0] → Remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- **Row 2**: [2,0,0,0] → Shifts left to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: [32,16,8,0] → Shifts left to [32,16,8,0] (no merge).  \n- **Outcome**: No merges occur. Large tiles (32, 16, 8) stay in the bottom row, but no progress toward future merges.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [4,2,0,0] → Shifts right to [0,0,4,2] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,0] → Remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- **Row 2**: [2,0,0,0] → Shifts right to [0,0,0,2] (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: [32,16,8,0] → Shifts right to [0,32,16,8] (no merge).  \n- **Outcome**: No merges occur. The largest tile (32) moves from the bottom-left corner to the bottom-middle, weakening strategic positioning.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [4,0,2,32] → Shifts up to [4,2,32,0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 1**: [2,0,0,16] → Shifts up to [2,16,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,8] → Shifts up to [8,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,0] → Remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- **Outcome**: No merges occur. The largest tile (32) moves from row 3 to row 2, losing the bottom-left corner position.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [4,0,2,32] → Shifts down to [0,4,2,32] (no merge).  \n- **Column 1**: [2,0,0,16] → Shifts down to [0,0,2,16] (no merge).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,8] → Shifts down to [0,0,0,8] (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,0] → Remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- **Key Observation**: After shifting, **Row 2 becomes [2,2,0,0]** (two adjacent 2s in the same row). This sets up a future LEFT swipe to merge these 2s into a 4, creating scoring potential.  \n- **Strategic Positioning**: The largest tile (32) remains in the bottom-left corner, maintaining a strong corner position for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN swipe is optimal because it preserves the largest tile (32) in the bottom-left corner and sets up adjacent 2s in Row 2, enabling a future merge.

Tiles shift upward, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). Tiles spread across rows, making future merges harder. Not optimal.  \n\n\n#### **Down Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed. Tiles shift downward, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). Larger tiles (32, 16, 8) remain in the bottom row but are not aligned for easy merging. Not optimal.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe left swipe is the best move. It merges 2s in Row 2 for immediate score, keeps larger tiles (32, 16, 8) in the bottom-left corner (a strategic position), and sets up Row 2’s 4s for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

Column 0 becomes `0|8|8|32`, with two 8s adjacent (row 1 and row 2), enabling future merges (e.g., merging into 16 with an UP swipe).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN keeps the largest tile (32) in the bottom-left corner, preserves the 16 and 8 in the bottom row, merges the 4s in column 0, and creates adjacent 8s in column 0 for future merging. This aligns best with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner and maximizing merging potential.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize score through merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 8|4|2|0  \nRow 3: 32|16|8|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1.

DOWN Move:\n- **Column 0**: [0,8,8,32] shifts down → [0,8,8,32]. The two 8s merge into 16, resulting in [0,0,16,32] (score +16).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,4,16] shifts down → [0,0,4,16] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,2,8] shifts down → [0,0,2,8] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: All zeros, no change.  \n**New Board**:  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 16|4|2|0  \nRow 3: 32|16|8|0  \n**Score Gain**: 16.  \n\n\n### Decision:\nBoth UP and DOWN moves merge the two 8s in Column 0, yielding a score of 16. However, DOWN is preferred because it keeps the largest tile (32) in the bottom-left corner, a strategic position for future merges. Larger tiles are better anchored in corners to avoid blocking smaller tiles. LEFT and RIGHT moves do not produce merges and are suboptimal.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile alignment, merging opportunities, and strategic placement of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|8|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|4|2|0\nRow 3: 32|16|8|0\n```\nKey observations:\n- The largest tile is 32, positioned in the bottom-left corner (row 3, column 0), which is an ideal corner for strategic play.\n- Other large tiles (16, 8) are adjacent to 32 in row 3 (columns 1 and 2), and 16 is also in row 2, column 0.\n- No adjacent tiles of the same value exist, so merges are not immediately possible. Valid moves rely on shifting tiles into empty spaces.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: [0,8,0,0] → Shifts left to [8,0,0,0] (8 moves to column 0).\n- **Row 1**: All zeros → No change.\n- **Row 2**: [16,4,2,0] → Already left-aligned (no empty spaces to the left of tiles) → No change.\n- **Row 3**: [32,16,8,0] → Already left-aligned (no empty spaces to the left of tiles) → No change.\n\nResulting board after LEFT:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|4|2|0\nRow 3: 32|16|8|0\n```\n- **Strategic Value**: The 32 (bottom-left corner) remains in place, and the 8 (row 0, column 0) aligns vertically with 16 (row 2, column 0) and 32 (row 3, column 0). This groups larger tiles in the left column, setting up potential future merges (e.g., 8 and 16 could merge if shifted upward later).\n\n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: [0,8,0,0] → Shifts right to [0,0,0,8] (8 moves to column 3).\n- **Row 1**: All zeros → No change.\n- **Row 2**: [16,4,2,0] → Shifts right to [0,16,4,2] (tiles move to columns 1-3).\n- **Row 3**: [32,16,8,0] → Shifts right to [0,32,16,8] (tiles move to columns 1-3).\n\nResulting board after RIGHT:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|8\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|16|4|2\nRow 3: 0|32|16|8\n```\n- **Strategic Value**: Larger tiles (32, 16, 8) shift to the right side of row 3, but this breaks the alignment of 32 with the bottom-left corner, reducing control over future merges.\n\n\n#### 3. UP:\n- **Column 0**: [0,0,16,32] → Shifts up to [16,32,0,0] (16 and 32 move to rows 0 and 1).\n- **Column 1**: [8,0,4,16] → Shifts up to [8,4,16,0] (8, 4, 16 move to rows 0, 1, 2).\n- **Column 2**: [0,0,2,8] → Shifts up to [2,8,0,0] (2 and 8 move to rows 0 and 1).\n- **Column 3**: All zeros → No change.\n\nResulting board after UP:\n```\nRow 0: 16|8|2|0\nRow 1: 32|4|8|0\nRow 2: 0|16|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n- **Strategic Value**: The 32 (originally in the bottom-left corner) shifts to row 1, column 0, disrupting the corner alignment. This reduces the ability to build a stable base for larger tiles.\n\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: [0,0,16,32] → Shifts down to [0,0,16,32] (no change, as tiles are already at the bottom).\n- **Column 1**: [8,0,4,16] → Shifts down to [0,8,4,16] (8 moves to row 1).\n- **Column 2**: [0,0,2,8] → Shifts down to [0,0,2,8] (no change, as tiles are already at the bottom).\n- **Column 3**: All zeros → No change.\n\nResulting board after DOWN:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|8|0|0\nRow 2: 16|4|2|0\nRow 3: 32|16|8|0\n```\n- **Strategic Value**: No meaningful changes to tile alignment; the 32 remains in the bottom-left corner, but no progress is made toward merging or grouping tiles.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT move is optimal because it retains the 32 in the bottom-left corner (a strategic corner) and aligns the 8 (row 0, column 0) vertically with 16 (row 2, column 0) and 32 (row 3, column 0). This setup facilitates future merges and maintains control over larger tiles.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|0|0\nRow 1: 2|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|4|2|0\nRow 3: 32|16|8|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles in each row are already left-aligned with no adjacent equal values to merge. Swiping left would not change the board, as no tiles can move left (no empty spaces to the left of existing tiles). No merges or movement occur. **Not a valid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles in each row can shift right into empty spaces (all rows have trailing zeros).  \n   - Row 0: `8` moves to the rightmost position → `0|0|0|8`.  \n   - Row 1: `2` moves to the rightmost position → `0|0|0|2`.  \n   - Row 2: `16`, `4`, `2` shift right → `0|16|4|2`.  \n   - Row 3: `32`, `16`, `8` shift right → `0|32|16|8`.  \n   No merges occur, but tiles move into new positions. **Valid move**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles in each column can shift up into empty spaces (columns have leading zeros).  \n   - Column 0: `8`, `2`, `16`, `32` (all distinct, no merging) → remains `8|2|16|32`.  \n   - Column 1: `0`, `0`, `4`, `16` → `4|16|0|0`.  \n   - Column 2: `0`, `0`, `2`, `8` → `2|8|0|0`.  \n   - Column 3: All zeros → remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n   Tiles move up, but no merges occur. **Valid move**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles in each column are already bottom-aligned with no empty spaces below them. Swiping down would not change the board, as no tiles can move down (no empty spaces below existing tiles). **Not a valid move**.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe goal is to group larger tiles in a corner for future merges. Swiping right aligns tiles to the right edge, creating a diagonal sequence of `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`, `32` (row 1 to row 3, rightmost columns). This configuration positions larger tiles (32, 16, 8) in the bottom-right area, which is ideal for future merging opportunities. Swiping up scatters tiles less effectively, leaving larger tiles (32, 16) in the left columns. Thus, **RIGHT** is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN, focusing on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|8\nRow 1: 0|16|0|2\nRow 2: 0|16|4|2\nRow 3: 0|32|16|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift left in each row, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n- Result: No score gain, and tiles are spread out with empty spaces. Not optimal.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift right in each row, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n- Result: Minimal movement, no score gain. Not optimal.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift upward in columns. Key merges:  \n  - Column 1 (rows 1-2): Two 16s merge into 32 (score +32).  \n  - Column 3 (rows 1-2): Two 2s merge into 4 (score +4).  \n- Total score: 36.  \n- Post-move board has larger tiles (32, 32) in the top half, which may disrupt corner-based strategies.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift downward in columns. Key merges:  \n  - Column 1 (rows 1-2): Two 16s merge into 32 (score +32).  \n  - Column 3 (rows 1-2): Two 2s merge into 4 (score +4).  \n- Total score: 36.  \n- Post-move board retains larger tiles (32, 16, 8) in the bottom row (row 3) and column 1 (rows 2-3), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and DOWN yield the same score, but DOWN better positions larger tiles in the bottom row, facilitating future merges (e.g., 32s in column 1 could merge into 64 with another DOWN swipe, and 4s in row 2 could merge into 8 with a LEFT swipe). Thus, DOWN is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|8\nRow 2: 4|32|4|4\nRow 3: 0|32|16|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: No change (all zeros).  \n- Row 1: 8 shifts left to position 0 → `8|0|0|0`.  \n- Row 2: 4, 32, 4, 4 → 4, 32, 8 (merged 4+4), 0 → `4|32|8|0` (score +8).  \n- Row 3: 0, 32, 16, 8 shifts left to `32|16|8|0`.  \n**Total Score: 8**  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: No change (all zeros).  \n- Row 1: 8 stays in position 3 → `0|0|0|8`.  \n- Row 2: 4, 32, 4, 4 → 0, 4, 32, 8 (merged 4+4) → `0|4|32|8` (score +8).  \n- Row 3: 0, 32, 16, 8 stays → `0|32|16|8`.  \n**Total Score: 8**  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Column 0: [0, 0, 4, 0] → 4 shifts up to row 0 → `4|0|0|0`.  \n- Column 1: [0, 0, 32, 32] → 32 and 32 merge into 64 (row 0) → `64|0|0|0` (score +64).  \n- Column 2: [0, 0, 4, 16] → 4 shifts up to row 0, 16 to row 1 → `4|16|0|0`.  \n- Column 3: [0, 8, 4, 8] → 8 shifts up to row 0, 4 to row 1, 8 to row 2 → `8|4|8|0`.  \n**Total Score: 64**  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Column 0: [0, 0, 4, 0] → 4 shifts down to row 3 → `0|0|0|4`.  \n- Column 1: [0, 0, 32, 32] → 32 and 32 merge into 64 (row 3) → `0|0|0|64` (score +64).  \n- Column 2: [0, 0, 4, 16] → 4 stays in row 2, 16 in row 3 → `0|0|4|16`.  \n- Column 3: [0, 8, 4, 8] → 8 (row 1) shifts down to row 2, 4 (row 2) shifts to row 1, then 8 (row 2) and 8 (row 3) merge into 16 (row 3) → `0|4|0|16` (score +16).  \n**Total Score: 64 + 16 = 80**  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nDOWN yields the highest score (80) by merging 32+32=64 and 8+8=16. Additionally, larger tiles (64, 16) are positioned in the bottom row, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score through tile merges and strategically position larger tiles for future moves.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 2: 0|32|4|4  \nRow 3: 4|64|16|8  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,8] → shifts left to [8,0,0,0].  \n- **Row 2**: [0,32,4,4] → shifts left, merging 4+4=8. Result: [32,8,0,0]. Score +8.  \n- **Row 3**: [4,64,16,8] → no merges (distinct values). Remains [4,64,16,8].  \n**Outcome**: 8 score, but larger tiles (32, 64) are scattered, with limited future merge potential.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,8] → no change (already rightmost).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,32,4,4] → shifts right, merging 4+4=8. Result: [0,0,32,8]. Score +8.  \n- **Row 3**: [4,64,16,8] → no merges (distinct values). Remains [4,64,16,8].  \n**Outcome**: 8 score. Notably, row 2 column 3 (8) and row 3 column 3 (8) now align vertically in column 3, setting up a potential merge in the next move (e.g., UP). This positions larger tiles (32, 64, 16) in the right half of the grid, which is strategic for future merges.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed top-to-bottom.  \n- **Column 0**: [0,0,0,4] → shifts up to [4,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,32,64] → shifts up to [0,32,64,0].  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,4,16] → shifts up to [0,0,4,16].  \n- **Column 3**: [0,8,4,8] → shifts up to [8,4,8,0].  \n**Outcome**: No merges (score 0). Larger tiles are fragmented, reducing future merge potential.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed bottom-to-top.  \n- **Column 0**: [0,0,0,4] → no change (already bottom-aligned).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,32,64] → no change (32 and 64 are distinct and bottom-aligned).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,4,16] → no change (4 and 16 are distinct and bottom-aligned).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,8,4,8] → no change (8, 4, 8 are distinct and bottom-aligned).  \n**Outcome**: No merges (score 0). Larger tiles remain scattered with no strategic positioning.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT provides an immediate 8 score and strategically positions tiles (e.g., 8s in column 3) for future merges. This aligns with the goal of keeping larger tiles in a corner and creating opportunities for higher-value merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 16|0|0|8\nRow 2: 0|0|32|8\nRow 3: 4|64|16|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row).  \n   - Result: No score gain, and the board remains mostly sparse with no strategic advantage.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row).  \n   - Result: No score gain, similar to LEFT with no meaningful changes.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed upward. Column 3 (values [0,8,8,8]) merges the top two 8s into 16 (score +16).  \n   - Result: Board becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 16|64|32|16  \n     Row 1: 4|0|16|8  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - While this merges one pair, the larger tiles (64, 32, 16) are spread across the top row, with no immediate follow-up merges possible.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed downward. Column 3 (values [0,8,8,8]) merges the bottom two 8s into 16 (score +16).  \n   - Result: Board becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 16|0|32|0  \n     Row 3: 4|64|16|16  \n     ```  \n   - The key advantage here is that row 3 now has adjacent 16s (columns 2 and 3), which can merge into 32 with a subsequent LEFT move, setting up future score gains. Larger tiles (64) remain in the bottom row, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners for better merging opportunities.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nDOWN is the optimal move, as it merges a pair of 8s for immediate score and positions the board for future merges (e.g., the 16s in row 3 can merge with a LEFT swipe next).\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the resulting board state, merges, and strategic positioning of tiles. The current game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 16|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|0|32|8\nRow 3: 4|64|16|16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [16,0,0,0] → Shifts left to [16,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,0] → Remains empty.  \n- **Row 2**: [16,0,32,8] → Shifts left to [16,32,8,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [4,64,16,16] → Shifts left, merging the two 16s into 32 → [4,64,32,0] (score +32).  \n- **Result**: 16s in Row 0 and Row 2 (Column 0) remain unmerged, and larger tiles are scattered.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [16,0,0,0] → Shifts right to [0,0,0,16] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,0] → Remains empty.  \n- **Row 2**: [16,0,32,8] → Shifts right to [0,16,32,8] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [4,64,16,16] → Shifts right, merging the two 16s into 32 → [4,64,0,32] (score +32).  \n- **Result**: Larger tiles (64, 32) are spread across the board, with no strategic cornering.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [16,0,16,4] → Shifts up, merging the two 16s into 32 → [32,4,0,0] (score +32).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,64] → Shifts up to [64,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,32,16] → Shifts up to [32,16,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,8,16] → Shifts up to [8,16,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: Merges the two 16s in Column 0, consolidates 64 in the top row (strategic cornering), and leaves empty rows below for future moves.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [16,0,16,4] → Shifts down, merging the two 16s into 32 → [0,0,32,4] (score +32).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,64] → Remains [0,0,0,64] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,32,16] → Shifts down to [0,0,32,16] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,8,16] → Shifts down to [0,0,8,16] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: 64 remains in the bottom row, and larger tiles are spread without clear strategic positioning.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe **UP** direction merges the two 16s in Column 0 (increasing the score and tile value), consolidates the 64 in the top row (favoring corner strategy), and leaves empty rows below for future flexibility. This makes it the optimal move.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on their ability to merge tiles and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 64 | 32 | 8\nRow 1: 4 | 0 | 16 | 16\nRow 2: 0 | 16 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `32, 64, 32, 8` have no adjacent equals, so they remain unchanged.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `4, 0, 16, 16` shift left. The `16` and `16` merge into `32` (score +32), resulting in `4, 32, 0, 0`.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles `0, 16, 0, 0` shift left to `16, 0, 0, 0`.\n- **Row 3**: No change.\n\nResulting board after LEFT:\n```\n32|64|32|8\n4|32|0|0\n16|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n```\nEmpty spaces are concentrated on the right, leaving room for future tile spawns without disrupting larger tiles. The merged `32` in Row 1, Column 1 is adjacent to the `64` in Row 0, Column 1, which could facilitate future merges.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `32, 64, 32, 8` have no adjacent equals, so they remain unchanged.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `4, 0, 16, 16` shift right. The `16` and `16` merge into `32` (score +32), resulting in `0, 4, 0, 32`.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles `0, 16, 0, 0` shift right to `0, 0, 0, 16`.\n- **Row 3**: No change.\n\nResulting board after RIGHT:\n```\n32|64|32|8\n0|4|0|32\n0|0|0|16\n0|0|0|0\n```\nEmpty spaces are concentrated on the left, but the merged `32` in Row 1, Column 3 is less strategically positioned relative to the `64` in Row 0, Column 1.\n\n### UP\/DOWN Moves:\nNeither UP nor DOWN results in tile merges, as columns do not contain adjacent equal tiles. These moves only shift tiles without scoring, making them less optimal than LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nLEFT merges the `16`s in Row 1 into a `32`, positions the `32` adjacent to the `64` in Row 0 (Column 1), and leaves empty spaces on the right to avoid disrupting larger tiles. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and facilitating future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|64|32|8\nRow 1: 4|32|0|0\nRow 2: 16|0|0|0\nRow 3: 4|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows are already compressed left (no zeros in the leftmost positions). No merges occur, and the board remains unchanged. No score gain.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Rows 1, 2, and 3 shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles merge. The board rearranges tiles to the right but without merges. No score gain.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are already compressed upward (no zeros in the top positions). No merges occur, and the board remains unchanged. No score gain.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed by shifting tiles downward. Key observations:  \n     - Column 1 (64, 32, 0, 0) shifts down to [0, 0, 64, 32].  \n     - Column 2 (32, 0, 0, 0) shifts down to [0, 0, 0, 32].  \n     - Column 3 (8, 0, 0, 0) shifts down to [0, 0, 0, 8].  \n   - After shifting, **Row 3 becomes [4, 32, 32, 8]**, with two adjacent 32s. This sets up a future merge opportunity (e.g., swiping left in the next move would merge these 32s into 64, yielding a score of 64).  \n\n### Strategic Rationale:\nMoving DOWN positions two 32s adjacently in Row 3, creating a critical merge opportunity for future moves. This aligns with the strategy of grouping smaller tiles to facilitate larger merges, which is key to maximizing scores. Other directions do not create such strategic opportunities.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board for possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate their outcomes based on merging potential, score gain, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|0|0|0\nRow 1: 4|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|64|0|32\nRow 3: 4|32|32|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left, remains `32|0|0|0` (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left, remains `4|0|0|0` (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left, becomes `16|64|32|0` (no merges, as 16, 64, 32 are distinct).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left. The two adjacent `32`s merge into `64` (score +64), resulting in `4|64|8|0`.\n\n**Result**: Score gain of 64. Larger tiles (e.g., 32 in Row 0, Column 0) remain in the top-left corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right, becomes `0|0|0|32` (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right, becomes `0|0|0|4` (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right, becomes `0|16|64|32` (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right. The two adjacent `32`s merge into `64` (score +64), resulting in `0|4|64|8`.\n\n**Result**: Score gain of 64. However, the 32 in Row 0 moves to the top-right corner, which is less optimal than keeping it in the top-left corner.\n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed upward. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. Tiles remain in their positions (e.g., Column 0: `32|4|16|4`; Column 1: `0|0|64|32`; etc.).\n\n**Result**: No score gain. No strategic advantage.\n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed downward. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. Tiles remain in their positions (e.g., Column 0: `32|4|16|4`; Column 1: `0|0|64|32`; etc.).\n\n**Result**: No score gain. No strategic advantage.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT swipes both yield a score gain of 64, but LEFT is preferable because it keeps the 32 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for larger tiles), whereas RIGHT moves it to the top-right. This aligns with the goal of keeping larger tiles in corners for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. The key is to identify merges that maximize score and position larger tiles advantageously.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 32|0|0|0\nRow 1: 4|0|16|0\nRow 2: 16|64|32|0\nRow 3: 4|64|8|0\n```\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows shift left, but no adjacent tiles are equal. No merges occur. Score: 0. Unfavorable.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - All rows shift right, but no adjacent tiles are equal. No merges occur. Score: 0. Unfavorable.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed upward. The critical column is Column 1: `[0, 0, 64, 64]`.  \n     - Shifting up removes zeros, consolidating the 64s to the top: `[64, 64, 0, 0]`.  \n     - The two 64s merge into 128 (score += 128).  \n   - Other columns (0, 2, 3) have no merges. After merging, the board becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 32|128|16|0  \n     Row 1: 4|0|32|0  \n     Row 2: 16|0|8|0  \n     Row 3: 4|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - The 128 is positioned in the top row, near the 32 in the top-left corner, which aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed downward. Column 1: `[0, 0, 64, 64]` also merges 64s into 128 (score += 128).  \n   - However, the merged 128 is placed in the bottom row (Row 3), which is less strategic for future merges compared to the top row.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and DOWN merge the 64s into 128, but UP positions the 128 in the top row, closer to the top-left corner (a strategic position for future merges). Thus, UP is the better move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 128 | 16 | 0\nRow 1: 4 | 2 | 32 | 0\nRow 2: 16 | 0 | 8 | 0\nRow 3: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct).  \n   - Example: Row 2 becomes `16 | 8 | 0 | 0` (shifting 8 left into empty space), but no merges.  \n   - Result: No score gain, minimal tile rearrangement.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, filling empty spaces. No merges occur immediately, but tiles compact to the right edge.  \n   - Example: Row 0 becomes `0 | 32 | 128 | 16` (16 moves to the rightmost empty space), Row 1 becomes `0 | 4 | 2 | 32`, Row 2 becomes `0 | 0 | 16 | 8`, and Row 3 becomes `0 | 0 | 0 | 4`.  \n   - Strategic benefit: Larger tiles (e.g., 128, 16, 32) are aligned to the right, which helps in cornering larger tiles for future merges (a common 2048 strategy).  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift up, but no merges occur (all columns have distinct or non-adjacent tiles).  \n   - Example: Column 1 (`128 | 2 | 0 | 0`) remains `128 | 2 | 0 | 0` (no movement into empty spaces).  \n   - Result: No score gain, no meaningful tile rearrangement.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down, but no merges occur (columns have distinct or non-adjacent tiles).  \n   - Example: Column 1 (`128 | 2 | 0 | 0`) becomes `0 | 0 | 128 | 2` (shifting 128 and 2 down), but no merges.  \n   - Strategic downside: Larger tiles (e.g., 128) are scattered, making cornering harder.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhile no immediate merges are possible, **RIGHT** is the best move. It compacts tiles to the right edge, aligning larger tiles (128, 16, 32) toward the right, which facilitates future merges and follows the strategy of cornering larger tiles.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize future merging potential and align larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 32 | 128 | 16  \nRow 1: 0 | 4 | 2 | 32  \nRow 2: 2 | 0 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **Left Swipe**:  \n- Tiles shift left, filling empty spaces but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  Row 0: 32 | 128 | 16 | 0  \n  Row 1: 4 | 2 | 32 | 0  \n  Row 2: 2 | 16 | 8 | 0  \n  Row 3: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n- No score gain; larger tiles (128, 32) are scattered, reducing future merge potential.\n\n#### **Right Swipe**:  \n- Tiles shift right, but most tiles are already right-aligned. No merges occur.  \n- Resulting board:  \n  Row 0: 0 | 32 | 128 | 16 (unchanged)  \n  Row 1: 0 | 4 | 2 | 32 (unchanged)  \n  Row 2: 0 | 2 | 16 | 8 (slight shift)  \n  Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 (unchanged)  \n- No score gain; tiles remain poorly aligned for merging.\n\n#### **Up Swipe**:  \n- Tiles shift upward, filling empty spaces but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  Row 0: 2 | 32 | 128 | 16  \n  Row 1: 0 | 4 | 2 | 32  \n  Row 2: 0 | 0 | 16 | 8  \n  Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 4  \n- No score gain; the largest tile (128) remains in the top row, not in a corner.\n\n#### **Down Swipe**:  \n- Tiles shift downward, stacking them toward the bottom. No merges occur immediately, but this aligns tiles for future merging:  \n  - Column 0: [0, 0, 2, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 2] (2 moves to bottom).  \n  - Column 1: [32, 4, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 32, 4] (32 and 4 shift down).  \n  - Column 2: [128, 2, 16, 0] → [0, 128, 2, 16] (128 shifts down to row 1).  \n  - Column 3: [16, 32, 8, 4] → [16, 32, 8, 4] (no change).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 16  \n  Row 1: 0 | 0 | 128 | 32  \n  Row 2: 0 | 32 | 2 | 8  \n  Row 3: 2 | 4 | 16 | 4  \n- While no merges occur immediately, this move positions the largest tile (128) in row 1, column 2, closer to the bottom-right corner. Smaller tiles (32, 16, 4) are stacked toward the bottom, creating opportunities for future merges when new tiles (2\/4) are added.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping **DOWN** aligns tiles toward the bottom, improving the strategic positioning of larger tiles for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (e.g., merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners, and creating future merge opportunities).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|16\nRow 1: 8|0|128|32\nRow 2: 0|32|2|8\nRow 3: 2|4|16|4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Tiles shift left in each row.  \n  - Row 0: [0,0,0,16] → [16,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n  - Row 1: [8,0,128,32] → [8,128,32,0] (no merges).  \n  - Row 2: [0,32,2,8] → [32,2,8,0] (no merges).  \n  - Row 3: [2,4,16,4] → [2,4,16,4] (no merges).  \n- Result: No merges, 16 moves to the top-left corner (row 0, column 0).  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Tiles shift right in each row.  \n  - Row 0: [0,0,0,16] → [0,0,0,16] (no merges).  \n  - Row 1: [8,0,128,32] → [0,8,128,32] (no merges).  \n  - Row 2: [0,32,2,8] → [0,32,2,8] (no merges).  \n  - Row 3: [2,4,16,4] → [2,4,16,4] (no merges).  \n- Result: No merges, 16 remains in the top-right corner (row 0, column 3).  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Tiles shift up in each column.  \n  - Column 0: [0,8,0,2] → [8,2,0,0] (no merges).  \n  - Column 1: [0,0,32,4] → [32,4,0,0] (no merges).  \n  - Column 2: [0,128,2,16] → [128,2,16,0] (no merges).  \n  - Column 3: [16,32,8,4] → [16,32,8,4] (no merges).  \n- Result: No merges, but larger tiles (128, 32, 16) stack in the top row ([8,32,128,16]), aligning them for potential future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles shift down in each column.  \n  - Column 0: [0,8,0,2] → [0,0,8,2] (no merges).  \n  - Column 1: [0,0,32,4] → [0,0,32,4] (no merges).  \n  - Column 2: [0,128,2,16] → [0,128,2,16] (no merges).  \n  - Column 3: [16,32,8,4] → [16,32,8,4] (no merges).  \n- Result: No merges, with larger tiles scattered and fewer opportunities for future merges.  \n\n\n### Strategic Decision:\nAll directions yield no immediate merges, but **UP** is preferred. It stacks larger tiles (128, 32, 16) in the top row, aligning them for potential future merges. This arrangement follows the strategy of keeping large tiles in a line (top row) to facilitate merging as smaller tiles are shifted into position.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify a move that maximizes future merging potential while adhering to strategic principles (e.g., keeping larger tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 32 | 128 | 16  \nRow 1: 2 | 4 | 2 | 32  \nRow 2: 32 | 0 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles are all distinct (8, 32, 128, 16) with no zeros, so no movement or merging.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles (2, 4, 2, 32) are distinct with no zeros, so no movement or merging.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles shift left to fill zeros: [32, 0, 16, 8] → [32, 16, 8, 0].  \n   - Row 3: Tiles shift left to fill zeros: [0, 0, 0, 4] → [4, 0, 0, 0].  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges, but tiles in Row 2 (32, 16, 8) and Row 3 (4) shift left, grouping smaller tiles and creating empty spaces on the right for future merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles are all distinct (8, 32, 128, 16) with no zeros, so no movement or merging.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles (2, 4, 2, 32) are distinct with no zeros, so no movement or merging.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles shift right to fill zeros: [32, 0, 16, 8] → [0, 32, 16, 8].  \n   - Row 3: Tiles (0, 0, 0, 4) already occupy the rightmost position, so no movement.  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges, but tiles in Row 2 shift right, leaving empty spaces on the left.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom. All columns have distinct tiles with no adjacent duplicates, so no merging. Tiles shift up to fill zeros but remain in non-overlapping positions.  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges or meaningful tile grouping.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom to top. All columns have distinct tiles with no adjacent duplicates, so no merging. Tiles shift down to fill zeros but do not meaningfully group.  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges or strategic improvement.  \n\n### Strategic Choice:\nNone of the moves result in immediate merges, but the LEFT swipe groups smaller tiles (32, 16, 8 in Row 2 and 4 in Row 3) to the left, creating empty spaces on the right. This aligns with the strategy of organizing tiles to facilitate future merges, especially with larger tiles like 128 in the top row (corner-adjacent).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 32 | 128 | 16\nRow 1: 2 | 4 | 2 | 32\nRow 2: 32 | 16 | 8 | 0\nRow 3: 4 | 0 | 64 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: No zeros; no movement.  \n   - Row 1: No zeros; no movement.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles [32, 16, 8, 0] shift left but remain [32, 16, 8, 0] (no merging).  \n   - Row 3: Tiles [4, 0, 64, 0] shift left to [4, 64, 0, 0] (no merging).  \n   - No merges occur, and only Row 3 shifts tiles. Larger tiles (e.g., 64) are not positioned optimally.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: No zeros; no movement.  \n   - Row 1: No zeros; no movement.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles [32, 16, 8, 0] shift right to [32, 16, 0, 8] (no merging).  \n   - Row 3: Tiles [4, 0, 64, 0] shift right to [0, 4, 0, 64] (no merging).  \n   - Key improvement: The 64 tile moves to the bottom-right corner (Row 3, Column 3), a strategic corner for future merges.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns 0-3 have no empty spaces that allow tiles to shift upward. No movement occurs. Invalid move.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 1: [32, 4, 16, 0] shifts down to [0, 32, 4, 16] (no merging).  \n   - Column 3: [16, 32, 0, 0] shifts down to [0, 0, 16, 32] (no merging).  \n   - No merges, and larger tiles (e.g., 64) do not gain a strategic position.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nMoving RIGHT positions the 64 tile in the bottom-right corner, a critical corner for building larger tiles. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners to facilitate future merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile positioning, and strategic advantage. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 8|32|128|16\nRow 1: 2|4|2|32\nRow 2: 0|32|16|8\nRow 3: 0|32|4|64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   - **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur.  \n   - **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right, but similarly, no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur.  \n   Both LEFT and RIGHT result in no score gain and minimal strategic benefit.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed top-to-bottom. In Column 1 (values: 32, 4, 32, 32), the two bottom 32s (rows 2 and 3) merge into 64, adding 64 to the score. Other columns have no merges.  \n   - Resulting board after UP:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 8|32|128|16  \n     Row 1: 2|4|2|32  \n     Row 2: 0|64|16|8  \n     Row 3: 0|0|4|64  \n     ```  \n   - The 64 merges but is placed in row 2, not a corner.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom-to-top. In Column 1 (values: 32, 4, 32, 32), the two bottom 32s (rows 2 and 3) merge into 64, adding 64 to the score. Other columns have no merges.  \n   - Resulting board after DOWN:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 8|32|128|16  \n     Row 1: 2|4|2|32  \n     Row 2: 0|0|16|8  \n     Row 3: 0|64|4|64  \n     ```  \n   - The 64 merges and is placed in row 3 (a corner row), which aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP and DOWN both yield a 64 merge, but DOWN positions the merged 64 in the bottom row (a corner), which is more strategic for future moves. LEFT and RIGHT provide no merges and are suboptimal.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to identify merges and strategic tile positioning.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 16 | 0 | 128 | 16  \nRow 1: 0 | 32 | 2 | 32  \nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 2 | 64 | 4 | 64  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: Shifts to [16, 128, 16, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: Shifts to [32, 2, 32, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: Shifts to [8, 4, 16, 8] (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: Shifts to [2, 64, 4, 64] (no merges).  \n   - **Result**: No merges.

Shifting right aligns them (16, 16) with 128 in between, but no merge (no score).  \n- **Row 1**: 2, 32, 2, 32 → shifts to 0, 0, 2, 2, 32, 32 → merges into 0, 0, 4, 64 (scores 4 + 64 = 68).  \n- **Row 2**: 8, 4, 16, 8 → 8s in columns 0 and 3. Shifting right aligns them (8, 8) → merges into 0, 4, 16, 16 → 16s merge into 32 (scores 16 + 32 = 48).  \n- **Row 3**: 2, 64, 4, 64 → 64s in columns 1 and 3. Shifting right pushes 4 to column 3, aligning 64s in columns 2 and 3 → merges into 2, 0, 0, 128 (scores 64 + 64 = 128).  \nTotal score from RIGHT: 68 + 48 + 128 = 244.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: 32, 2, 8, 2 → 2s in rows 1 and 3.

For example:\n  - Row 0: 32, 16, 128, 16 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 1: 2, 32, 2, 32 (2s and 32s are separated by other tiles).\n  - Row 2: 8, 4, 16, 8 (8s are separated by 4 and 16).\n  - Row 3: 2, 64, 4, 64 (64s are separated by 4).\n  - Columns similarly have no adjacent duplicates.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\nA valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces.

All rows have non-zero tiles with no adjacent duplicates, so no merges occur. The board remains unchanged.  \n\n### RIGHT Move Analysis  \nFor each row, tiles are shifted right. Only the fourth row (row 3: `2|64|4|64`) has mergable tiles. When processing right:  \n- Reverse row 3 to `64|4|64|2` (simulating a left move on the reversed row).  \n- The reversed row `64|4|64|2` shifts left, causing the two `64`s to merge into `128`.  \n- Reversing back, the row becomes `0|2|4|128`.  \n\nThis results in a merge of the two `64`s into a `128`, adding 128 to the score.  \n\n### UP Move Analysis  \nFor each column, tiles are shifted up. All columns have non-zero tiles with no adjacent duplicates, so no merges occur. The board remains unchanged.  \n\n### DOWN Move Analysis  \nFor each column, tiles are shifted down. All columns have non-zero tiles with no adjacent duplicates, so no merges occur.

Thus, no valid merges are possible in any direction. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four moves, a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and the game rules. The goal is to identify which move allows merging tiles (to gain score) or sets up for future merges while keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 1: 2 | 32 | 2 | 32  \nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 2 | 64 | 4 | 64  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows are fully occupied (no zeros). Tiles cannot shift left because there are no empty spaces. No adjacent tiles in any row are equal, so no merges occur.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows are fully occupied. Tiles cannot shift right because there are no empty spaces. No adjacent tiles in any row are equal, so no merges occur.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - All columns are fully occupied. Tiles cannot shift up because there are no empty spaces. No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, so no merges occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - All columns are fully occupied. Tiles cannot shift down because there are no empty spaces. No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, so no merges occur.  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\nThe grid is completely full (no zeros), and no two adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. According to the rules, a valid move requires either adjacent equal tiles (to merge) or empty spaces (to shift tiles). Since neither condition is met, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the directions, and **RIGHT** is chosen as a strategic choice to potentially set up future merges by shifting larger tiles toward the right corner.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges and valid shifts in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). A valid move requires either adjacent tiles with the same number (which can merge) or empty spaces (0s) to shift tiles into. The current grid has no empty tiles (all positions are filled with non-zero values), so valid moves depend on adjacent tiles with the same number.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 1: 2 | 32 | 2 | 32  \nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 2 | 64 | 4 | 64  \n```\n\n### Direction Evaluation:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Each row is processed left-to-right. No adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., Row 0: 32, 16, 128, 16; Row 1: 2, 32, 2, 32; etc.). No merges or shifts occur.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Each row is processed right-to-left. No adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., Row 0: 32, 16, 128, 16; Row 3: 2, 64, 4, 64; etc.). No merges or shifts occur.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Each column is processed top-to-bottom. No adjacent tiles in any column are the same (e.g., Column 0: 32, 2, 8, 2; Column 3: 16, 32, 8, 64; etc.). No merges or shifts occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Each column is processed bottom-to-top. No adjacent tiles in any column are the same (e.g., Column 0: 32, 2, 8, 2; Column 1: 16, 32, 4, 64; etc.). No merges or shifts occur.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles), and no adjacent tiles have the same number. Thus, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any direction is technically invalid, but the answer must be chosen as per the instructions.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) by evaluating tile merges and shifts on the given 4x4 grid.

Tiles shift up but no merges.  \n**Result**: No merges.  \n\n\n#### 4. DOWN  \n- **Column 0**: [32, 2, 8, 2] – No adjacent duplicates. Tiles shift down but no merges.  \n- **Column 1**: [16, 32, 4, 64] – No adjacent duplicates. Tiles shift down but no merges.  \n- **Column 2**: [128, 2, 16, 4] – No adjacent duplicates. Tiles shift down but no merges.  \n- **Column 3**: [16, 32, 8, 64] – No adjacent duplicates. Tiles shift down but no merges.  \n**Result**: No merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe grid is fully occupied, and there are no adjacent tiles with the same value to merge. All directions result in no valid merges. Since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we choose arbitrarily (common in such edge cases).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning.

No merging.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles `2, 64, 4, 64` have non-adjacent 64s. No merging.  \n   Result: No merges, but tiles shift left (no empty spaces, so grid remains unchanged).  \n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles `32, 16, 128, 16` have non-adjacent 16s. No merging.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles `2, 32, 2, 32` have non-adjacent 2s and 32s. No merging.  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles `8, 4, 16, 8` have non-adjacent 8s.

No merging.  \n   - **Column 3**: Tiles `16, 32, 8, 64` are all distinct. No merging.  \n   Result: No merges, tiles shift up (grid remains unchanged).  \n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   - **Column 0**: Tiles `32, 2, 8, 2` have non-adjacent 2s.

No merging.  \n   Result: No merges, tiles shift down (grid remains unchanged).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves fail to merge tiles or create empty spaces. However, since the game requires selecting a direction, **LEFT** is chosen as a default strategic move to potentially align smaller tiles for future merges. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning.

For example:\n  - Row 0: 32, 16, 128, 16 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 1: 2, 32, 2, 32 (duplicates are separated by other tiles).\n  - Row 2: 8, 4, 16, 8 (duplicates are separated by other tiles).\n  - Row 3: 2, 64, 4, 64 (duplicates are separated by other tiles).\n  - Columns (vertical check) also have no adjacent duplicates.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, none of these moves will result in tile movement or merging. A valid move requires either merging or shifting into empty spaces, which is impossible here.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere are no valid moves left. However, per the problem constraints, the answer must be one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid moves, any direction is technically invalid, but we select the first option.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to identify merges that maximize the score and strategically position larger tiles.

No merges occur. Score: 0.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [2, 32, 2, 32] shift right. The 2s (positions 0 and 2) merge into 4, and the 32s (positions 1 and 3) merge into 64. This generates 4 + 64 = 68 points.  \n- Other rows (0, 2, 3) have no merges. Total score: 68.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- All columns have no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur.

Tiles cannot shift left, and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal to merge. No merges or shifts occur.  \n- **RIGHT Swipe**: Similarly, all rows are full. Tiles cannot shift right, and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal to merge. No merges or shifts occur.  \n- **UP Swipe**: All columns are full (no 0s).

A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles or moving tiles into empty spaces. Since there are no empty spaces, only merges can make a move valid.\n- **Adjacent Tiles**: No horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles have the same value. For example:\n  - Row 0: 32, 16, 128, 16 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 1: 2, 32, 2, 32 (2s and 32s are separated by other tiles).\n  - Row 2: 8, 4, 16, 8 (8s are separated by 4 and 16).\n  - Row 3: 2, 64, 4, 64 (64s are separated by 4).\n  - Columns: All columns also lack adjacent duplicates (e.g., Column 0: 32, 2, 8, 2; Column 1: 16, 32, 4, 64; etc.).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Shifting tiles left or right does not create adjacent duplicates (e.g., row 1: [2, 32, 2, 32] shifted left\/right remains [2, 32, 2, 32] with no merges).\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Shifting tiles up or down also fails to create adjacent duplicates (e.g., column 0: [32, 2, 8, 2] shifted up\/down remains [32, 2, 8, 2] with no merges).\n\nSince no valid merges are possible and the grid is full, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, any direction would technically be invalid, but we proceed with the assumption that the game continues.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile alignment. The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 32|16|128|16  \nRow 1: 2|32|2|32  \nRow 2: 8|4|16|8  \nRow 3: 2|64|4|64  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles (0s):** The grid is fully occupied, so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **Adjacent tiles:** No horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles have the same value in the current state. Merges can only occur if tiles shift to become adjacent during a move.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT:**  \n   - Each row is processed leftward. For example, Row 1: `[2, 32, 2, 32]` would shift left, but the 2s and 32s are not adjacent. No merges occur.  \n   - All rows and columns remain unchanged as no adjacent duplicates are present to merge.  \n\n2. **RIGHT:**  \n   - Each row is processed rightward. For example, Row 3: `[2, 64, 4, 64]` would shift right, but the 64s are not adjacent. No merges occur.  \n   - All rows and columns remain unchanged.  \n\n3. **UP:**  \n   - Columns are processed upward. For example, Column 0: `[32, 2, 8, 2]` has 2s in Row 1 and Row 3, but they are separated by 8 (Row 2). No merges occur.  \n   - All columns remain unchanged.  \n\n4. **DOWN:**  \n   - Columns are processed downward. For example, Column 3: `[16, 32, 8, 64]` has no adjacent duplicates. No merges occur.  \n   - All columns remain unchanged.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) result in no merges or shifts since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge. However, the problem requires selecting one direction. Given the strategic goal of aligning larger tiles (e.g., 32, 64, 128) to corners for future merges, **LEFT** is chosen as a neutral direction that does not disrupt potential future alignments.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning. The current board has no empty tiles (all tiles are non-zero), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number to merge. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 1: 2 | 32 | 2 | 32  \nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 2 | 64 | 4 | 64  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No Empty Tiles**: The grid is fully occupied (16 tiles, no zeros).  \n- **No Adjacent Merges**: There are no horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles with the same number. For example:  \n  - Row 0: 32, 16, 128, 16 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Row 1: 2, 32, 2, 32 (2s and 32s are separated by other tiles).  \n  - Row 2: 8, 4, 16, 8 (8s are separated by 4 and 16).  \n  - Row 3: 2, 64, 4, 64 (64s are separated by 4).  \n  - Columns: All columns also lack adjacent duplicates (e.g., Column 0: 32, 2, 8, 2; Column 1: 16, 32, 4, 64; etc.).  \n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, none of these moves will result in tile merging. Additionally, without empty spaces, tiles cannot shift into new positions. Thus, all moves are invalid under the game rules (no merges or empty spaces to move into).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe game ends because there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the choice is arbitrary. For consistency with strategic goals (e.g., preparing for future merges), **UP** is selected as a neutral direction.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and tile arrangement. The current board has no empty tiles (all values are non-zero), so valid moves depend on adjacent tiles of the same value.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 1: 2 | 32 | 2 | 32  \nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 2 | 64 | 4 | 64  \n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: All rows are already packed left with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur.  \n2. **RIGHT**: All rows are already packed right with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur.  \n3. **UP**: All columns are already packed top with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur.  \n4. **DOWN**: All columns are already packed bottom with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur.  \n\n### Key Observations:\n- There are no empty tiles (0s), so no tiles can shift into empty spaces.  \n- No adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value, so no merges are possible in any direction.  \n\nSince the grid is full and no valid merges exist, the game would typically end. However, the problem requires selecting one of the directions. Given no strategic advantage, any direction is technically acceptable, but we choose **LEFT** as a default.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and game rules. The goal is to maximize score and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 1: 2 | 32 | 2 | 32  \nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 2 | 64 | 4 | 64  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: [32, 16, 128, 16] has no adjacent or shiftable tiles. No merges.  \n- **Row 1**: [2, 32, 2, 32] shifts left, bringing the two 2s and two 32s adjacent. Merges: 2+2=4 (score +4) and 32+32=64 (score +64). Result: [4, 64, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 2**: [8, 4, 16, 8] has no adjacent or shiftable tiles. No merges.  \n- **Row 3**: [2, 64, 4, 64] has no adjacent or shiftable tiles. No merges.  \n**Total Score Gain**: 4 + 64 = 68. Creates two empty tiles (row 1, columns 2-3) for future moves.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: [32, 16, 128, 16] has no adjacent or shiftable tiles. No merges.  \n- **Row 1**: [2, 32, 2, 32] shifts right, bringing the two 32s adjacent. Merge: 32+32=64 (score +64). Result: [0, 0, 2, 64].  \n- **Row 2**: [8, 4, 16, 8] has no adjacent or shiftable tiles. No merges.  \n- **Row 3**: [2, 64, 4, 64] has no adjacent or shiftable tiles. No merges.  \n**Total Score Gain**: 64. Creates two empty tiles (row 1, columns 0-1) but leaves smaller tiles (2) on the right.\n\n\n#### **UP\/DOWN Moves**:\n- All columns have no adjacent or shiftable tiles (no merges or movement possible). These moves are invalid.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is optimal. It merges both 2s and 32s in row 1, yielding a higher score (68 vs. 64 for RIGHT) and strategically positions larger tiles (4, 64) on the left, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify valid moves that allow merging tiles (to increase the score) or moving tiles into empty spaces. The current grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 1: 2 | 32 | 2 | 32  \nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 2 | 64 | 4 | 64  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   For each row, tiles shift left. No adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., Row 0: 32, 16, 128, 16; Row 1: 2, 32, 2, 32; etc.). No merges occur, and no tiles move (grid remains unchanged). **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right. Similar to LEFT, no adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., Row 3: 2, 64, 4, 64; Row 1: 2, 32, 2, 32; etc.). No merges or movement. **Invalid move**.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Columns are processed to shift tiles up. All columns have distinct adjacent values (e.g., Column 0: 32, 2, 8, 2; Column 3: 16, 32, 8, 64; etc.). No merges or movement. **Invalid move**.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Columns are processed to shift tiles down. All columns have distinct adjacent values (e.g., Column 0: 32, 2, 8, 2; Column 3: 16, 32, 8, 64; etc.). No merges or movement. **Invalid move**.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied, and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) are the same. Thus, there are no valid moves.

When moving right, tiles shift to the right. The two `64` tiles in positions 1 and 3 are adjacent after shifting and merge into `128`.  \n   - Result for Row 3: `0|2|4|128` (merged `64` → `128`, scoring 128 points).

The current grid has no empty tiles (all values are non-zero), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same number.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\n32|16|128|16\n2|32|2|32\n8|4|16|8\n2|64|4|64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   For each row, tiles shift left. No adjacent tiles in any row are the same, so no merges occur. Example:  \n   - Row 2: `2|32|2|32` → Shifting left leaves tiles unchanged (no merges).  \n   - All rows remain unchanged after shifting.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right. Similarly, no adjacent tiles in any row are the same, so no merges occur. Example:  \n   - Row 4: `2|64|4|64` → Shifting right leaves tiles unchanged (no merges).  \n   - All rows remain unchanged after shifting.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Columns shift upward. No adjacent tiles in any column are the same, so no merges occur. Example:  \n   - Column 1: `32|2|8|2` → Shifting up leaves tiles unchanged (no merges).  \n   - All columns remain unchanged after shifting.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Columns shift downward. No adjacent tiles in any column are the same, so no merges occur. Example:  \n   - Column 4: `16|32|8|64` → Shifting down leaves tiles unchanged (no merges).  \n   - All columns remain unchanged after shifting.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full (no empty tiles), and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) are the same. Thus, **no valid moves** exist to merge tiles or create empty spaces. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we choose based on strategic conventions (e.g., minimizing disruption to larger tiles). The largest tile (128) is in the top row; moving LEFT keeps larger tiles consolidated leftward, aligning with common 2048 strategies.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or tile movements in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or shifting tiles into empty spaces. The current grid has no empty tiles (all tiles are non-zero), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent duplicates.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 1: 2 | 32 | 2 | 32  \nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 2 | 64 | 4 | 64  \n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: 32, 16, 128, 16 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n- **Row 1**: 2, 32, 2, 32 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n- **Row 2**: 8, 4, 16, 8 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n- **Row 3**: 2, 64, 4, 64 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n**Result**: No movement or merges. Invalid.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: 32, 16, 128, 16 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n- **Row 1**: 2, 32, 2, 32 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n- **Row 2**: 8, 4, 16, 8 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n- **Row 3**: 2, 64, 4, 64 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n**Result**: No movement or merges. Invalid.\n\n### UP Move:\n- **Column 0**: 32, 2, 8, 2 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n- **Column 1**: 16, 32, 4, 64 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n- **Column 2**: 128, 2, 16, 4 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n- **Column 3**: 16, 32, 8, 64 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n**Result**: No movement or merges. Invalid.\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- **Column 0**: 32, 2, 8, 2 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n- **Column 1**: 16, 32, 4, 64 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n- **Column 2**: 128, 2, 16, 4 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n- **Column 3**: 16, 32, 8, 64 (no adjacent duplicates; no merges or shifts).  \n**Result**: No movement or merges. Invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number in any direction. Thus, no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the answer defaults to an arbitrary choice (though no valid moves are possible).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile movement. The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value in the direction of the swipe.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|16|128|16  \nRow 1: 2|32|2|32  \nRow 2: 8|4|16|8  \nRow 3: 2|64|4|64  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows are fully occupied. No adjacent tiles in any row have the same value (e.g., Row 0: 32,16,128,16; Row 1: 2,32,2,32). Tiles cannot merge or shift left. No valid merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Similarly, all rows are full. No adjacent tiles in any row have the same value when processed rightward (e.g., Row 0: 32,16,128,16; Row 1: 2,32,2,32). Tiles cannot merge or shift right. No valid merges.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - All columns are fully occupied. No adjacent tiles in any column have the same value (e.g., Column 0: 32,2,8,2; Column 1: 16,32,4,64). Tiles cannot merge or shift up. No valid merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - All columns are fully occupied. No adjacent tiles in any column have the same value (e.g., Column 0: 32,2,8,2; Column 3: 16,32,8,64). Tiles cannot merge or shift down. No valid merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. Thus, no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement. The current grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same number to merge.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 32 | 16 | 128 | 16  \nRow 1: 2 | 32 | 2 | 32  \nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 16 | 8  \nRow 3: 2 | 64 | 4 | 64  \n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows have no adjacent identical tiles. For example, Row 1: `2, 32, 2, 32` has 2s and 32s separated by other numbers, so no merges.  \n   - No merges occur in any row.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Similar to LEFT, no adjacent identical tiles in any row. For example, Row 3: `2, 64, 4, 64` has 64s separated by 4, so no merges.  \n   - No merges occur in any row.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - All columns have no adjacent identical tiles. For example, Column 0: `32, 2, 8, 2` has 2s separated by 8, so no merges.  \n   - No merges occur in any column.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - All columns have no adjacent identical tiles. For example, Column 3: `16, 32, 8, 64` has all distinct values, so no merges.  \n   - No merges occur in any column.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full (no empty tiles), and there are no adjacent identical tiles in any direction. This means no merges are possible, and technically, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we choose a direction that minimally disrupts tile alignment. Given the lack of merges, any direction is equally valid, but **LEFT** is chosen as a default strategic choice to keep larger tiles consolidated.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic positioning of tiles. The grid is:\n\n```\n32|16|128|16\n2|32|2|32\n8|4|16|8\n2|64|4|64\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No Empty Tiles**: The grid is completely filled (no zeros), so any valid move must involve merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **Adjacent Tiles**: Checking all rows and columns, there are no adjacent tiles with the same value. For example:\n  - Rows: All rows have distinct adjacent values (e.g., row 2: `2, 32, 2, 32` has 2s and 32s separated by other tiles).\n  - Columns: All columns also have distinct adjacent values (e.g., column 1: `32, 2, 8, 2` has 2s separated by 8).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, shifting left or right will not change the positions of the tiles. No merges occur.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Similarly, shifting up or down will not alter the tile positions, as there are no empty spaces to shift into and no adjacent tiles to merge.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent tiles of the same value, meaning there are no valid moves to merge tiles or shift into empty spaces. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and all moves are functionally equivalent (no merges or shifts), any direction is technically a valid answer under the constraints.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning. The grid is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 32|16|128|16\nRow 1: 2|32|2|32\nRow 2: 8|4|16|8\nRow 3: 2|64|4|64\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Grid State**: All tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent equal tiles.\n- **Adjacent Tiles**: No horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles are equal. For example:\n  - Row 0: 32, 16, 128, 16 (16s are separated by 128).\n  - Row 1: 2, 32, 2, 32 (2s and 32s are separated by other tiles).\n  - Row 2: 8, 4, 16, 8 (8s are separated by 4 and 16).\n  - Row 3: 2, 64, 4, 64 (64s are separated by 4).\n- **Merging Potential**: Since no adjacent tiles are equal, no merges occur in any direction. All swipes will leave the grid unchanged.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: All directions result in no tile movement or merging because the grid is full, and no adjacent tiles can merge. The board remains identical after any swipe.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWith no valid merges possible and the grid full, any direction is technically a valid move (as per the problem constraints requiring one of the four options). A strategic choice (e.g., LEFT) is selected to maintain consistency.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid, which has no empty tiles (all tiles are non-zero). A valid move requires either adjacent tiles of the same number (to merge) or empty spaces to shift tiles into. Since the grid is full, only moves with adjacent same tiles are valid.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 32|16|128|16  \nRow 1: 2|32|2|32  \nRow 2: 8|4|16|8  \nRow 3: 2|64|4|64  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Each row is processed to shift tiles left and merge adjacent equals.  \n   - Row 0: [32,16,128,16] – No adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Row 1: [2,32,2,32] – 2s and 32s are non-adjacent (separated by 32 and 2, respectively).

By the rules, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the most plausible choice (despite no immediate merges) is **LEFT**, as it is a common strategic direction to consolidate smaller tiles. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and the game rules.

The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: LEFT'\nRules:The game is played on a 4x4 grid, with each tile containing a number that is a power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048). Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n32|16|128|16\n2|32|2|32\n8|4|16|8\n2|64|4|64\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 2|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|2|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [2,0,0,0] shifts left to [2,0,0,0] (no merging).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,2,0] shifts left to [2,0,0,0] (no merging).  \n   - Rows 2 and 3 remain all zeros.  \n   - After moving left, the grid becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 2|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 2|0|0|0  \n     Rows 2-3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - The two 2s are now in the same column (column 0, rows 0 and 1), adjacent vertically. This positions them to merge if a subsequent UP move is made, creating a 4 and earning points.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [2,0,0,0] shifts right to [0,0,0,2] (no merging).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,2,0] shifts right to [0,0,0,2] (no merging).  \n   - Rows 2 and 3 remain all zeros.  \n   - After moving right, the grid becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|0|2  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|2  \n     Rows 2-3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - The two 2s are in the same column (column 3, rows 0 and 1), adjacent vertically. This allows merging with a DOWN move, but the 2s are in the rightmost column, which is less strategic for corner consolidation.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: [2,0,0,0] shifts up to [2,0,0,0] (no merging).  \n   - Column 2: [0,2,0,0] shifts up to [2,0,0,0] (no merging).  \n   - After moving up, the grid becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 2|0|2|0  \n     Rows 1-3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - The two 2s are in the same row (row 0, columns 0 and 2), separated by a zero. They cannot merge immediately, and merging would require a subsequent LEFT move, but this is less efficient than vertical adjacency.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: [2,0,0,0] shifts down to [0,0,0,2] (no merging).  \n   - Column 2: [0,2,0,0] shifts down to [0,0,0,2] (no merging).  \n   - After moving down, the grid becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 3: 2|0|2|0  \n     Rows 0-2: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - The two 2s are in the same row (row 3, columns 0 and 2), separated by a zero. Merging would require a subsequent RIGHT move, which is less efficient than vertical adjacency.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nMoving LEFT consolidates the 2s in the leftmost column (a corner), making them vertically adjacent. This positions them for a future UP move to merge into a 4, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners and enabling efficient merging. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the current game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left in each row.  \n   - Row 0: [2,0,0,0] → remains [2,0,0,0] (no merging).  \n   - Row 1: [2,0,0,0] → remains [2,0,0,0] (no merging).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,0,2] → shifts to [2,0,0,0] (no merging).  \n   - Row 3: [0,0,0,0] → remains empty.  \n   - **Result**: No merging occurs. No score is gained.  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right in each row.  \n   - Row 0: [2,0,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,2] (no merging).  \n   - Row 1: [2,0,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,2] (no merging).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,0,2] → remains [0,0,0,2] (no merging).  \n   - Row 3: [0,0,0,0] → remains empty.  \n   - **Result**: No merging occurs. No score is gained.  \n\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift upward column-wise.  \n   - **Column 0**: [2 (row 0), 2 (row 1), 0 (row 2), 0 (row 3)] → The two 2s merge into 4 (top of the column). Score +4.  \n   - **Column 3**: [0 (row 0), 0 (row 1), 2 (row 2), 0 (row 3)] → The 2 shifts up to row 0.  \n   - **Resulting Board**:  \n     Row 0: 4|0|0|2  \n     Rows 1-3: All empty.  \n   - **Score Gained**: 4. Larger tile (4) is consolidated in the top-left corner (a strategic corner).  \n\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift downward column-wise.  \n   - **Column 0**: [2 (row 0), 2 (row 1), 0 (row 2), 0 (row 3)] → The two 2s shift down and merge into 4 (bottom of the column). Score +4.  \n   - **Column 3**: [0 (row 0), 0 (row 1), 2 (row 2), 0 (row 3)] → The 2 shifts down to row 3.  \n   - **Resulting Board**:  \n     Rows 0-2: All empty.  \n     Row 3: 4|0|0|2  \n   - **Score Gained**: 4. Larger tile (4) is consolidated in the bottom-left corner.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and DOWN merge the two 2s into a 4, gaining 4 points. However, the strategy emphasizes keeping larger tiles in a corner to facilitate future merges. Swiping UP places the 4 in the top-left corner, which is a common strategic corner for building higher tiles. This position is more favorable for future moves, as it leaves space below to merge additional tiles upward.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|0|2\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|2|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**:\n- Tiles in each row shift left. For Row 0: `4|0|0|2` becomes `4|2|0|0` (no merges, as 4 and 2 are distinct). Other rows remain empty. No score gain.\n\n#### **RIGHT**:\n- Tiles in each row shift right. For Row 0: `4|0|0|2` becomes `0|0|4|2` (no merges). Row 3: `0|0|2|0` becomes `0|0|0|2`. No merges occur. No score gain.\n\n#### **UP**:\n- Tiles in each column shift upward. Columns are processed as follows:\n  - Column 0: `4|0|0|0` → remains `4|0|0|0`.\n  - Column 1: `0|0|0|0` → remains `0|0|0|0`.\n  - Column 2: `0|0|0|2` → `2` shifts up to Row 0: `2|0|0|0`.\n  - Column 3: `2|0|0|0` → `2` stays in Row 0: `2|0|0|0`.\n  \n  After shifting, Row 0 becomes `4|0|2|2`. The two `2`s in Row 0 (columns 2 and 3) are adjacent and merge into a `4`. The merged board becomes:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 4|0|0|4\n  Rows 1-3: All 0s\n  ```\n  Score increases by 4 (from merging two `2`s into `4`).\n\n#### **DOWN**:\n- Tiles in each column shift downward. Columns are processed as follows:\n  - Column 0: `4|0|0|0` → `4` shifts down to Row 3: `0|0|0|4`.\n  - Column 1: `0|0|0|0` → remains `0|0|0|0`.\n  - Column 2: `0|0|0|2` → `2` stays in Row 3: `0|0|0|2`.\n  - Column 3: `2|0|0|0` → `2` shifts down to Row 3: `0|0|0|2`.\n  \n  After shifting, Row 3 becomes `4|0|2|2`. The two `2`s in Row 3 (columns 2 and 3) are adjacent and merge into a `4`. The merged board becomes:\n  ```\n  Rows 0-2: All 0s\n  Row 3: 4|0|0|4\n  ```\n  Score increases by 4 (from merging two `2`s into `4`).\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nBoth UP and DOWN result in merging two `2`s into a `4` (score +4). However, keeping larger tiles in a corner (a common 2048 strategy) favors UP here. After UP, the merged `4`s are in the top row (Row 0), which can facilitate future merges by shifting tiles upward again. This aligns with building toward a corner (top-left or top-right) for better control.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic tile positioning.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\nRow 0: 4|0|2|2  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|2|0|0  \n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [4,0,2,2] shifts left → [4,2,2,0]. The adjacent 2s merge into 4, resulting in [4,4,0,0].

Columns 2-3: [2,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,2].  \n   - Resulting board (before new tile):  \n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 4|2|2|2  \n   - No merges occur; tiles are spread across Row 3 without immediate merging potential.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is optimal because it merges 2s in Row 0 (scoring +4) and positions 4s in the top-left corner, a strategic location for building larger tiles.

This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (top-left) and enabling future merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right in each row.  \n   - Row 0: [8,2,0,0] → [0,0,8,2] (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: [4,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,4] (4 moves right).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,0,4] → [0,0,0,4] (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: [2,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,2] (2 moves right).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|8|2  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|4  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|4  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|2  \n     ```  \n   - No immediate merges, and larger tiles (8, 4, 4) are scattered, making it harder to build a corner.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift up in each column.  \n   - Column 0: [8,4,0,2] → [8,4,2,0] (no merge).  \n   - Column 1: [2,0,0,0] → [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: [0,0,4,0] → [4,0,0,0] (4 moves up).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 8|2|0|4  \n     Row 1: 4|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 2|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - No merges, and larger tiles (8, 4, 2) are spread across columns, reducing strategic positioning.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift down in each column.  \n   - Column 0: [8,4,0,2] → [0,8,4,2] (no merge).  \n   - Column 1: [2,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,2] (2 moves down).  \n   - Column 3: [0,0,4,0] → [0,0,0,4] (4 moves down).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 8|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 4|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 2|2|0|4  \n     ```  \n   - While two `2`s are adjacent in Row 3, Columns 0-1, this does not create a clear path for merging larger tiles, and the 8 is isolated in Row 1, Column 0.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe positions the `4` from Row 2, Column 3 into Row 2, Column 0, creating adjacent `4`s in Column 0 (Row 1 and Row 2). This sets up a future UP swipe to merge these `4`s into an `8`, reinforcing the top-left corner and enabling further strategic merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize merges and set up for future moves, ideally keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|2|0|0  \nRow 1: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 2|0|2|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: [8,2,0,0] → No merges (8 and 2 are distinct).  \n- Row 1: [4,0,0,0] → No merges.  \n- Row 2: [4,0,0,0] → No merges.  \n- Row 3: [2,0,2,0] → 2s merge into 4 (score +4).  \n- Result: Only 1 merge (row 3) with minimal score gain.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: [8,2,0,0] → Tiles shift right to [0,0,8,2] (no merges).  \n- Row 1: [4,0,0,0] → Tiles shift right to [0,0,0,4] (no merges).  \n- Row 2: [4,0,0,0] → Tiles shift right to [0,0,0,4] (no merges).  \n- Row 3: [2,0,2,0] → Tiles shift right to [0,0,2,2], then merge into 4 (score +4).  \n- Result: Only 1 merge (row 3), same as LEFT but with tiles shifted right.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Column 0 (rows 0-3: [8,4,4,2]):  \n  - Tiles shift up: 8,4,4,2.  \n  - 4s in rows 1 and 2 merge into 8 (score +8).  \n  - Remaining 2 shifts up to row 2.  \n  - Column 0 becomes [8,8,2,0].  \n- Column 1 (rows 0-3: [2,0,0,0]):  \n  - Tiles shift up to [2,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n- Columns 2-3: All zeros (no changes).  \n- Result: Merges 4s in column 0 for 8 points. Larger tiles (8s) stack vertically in column 0 (top-left corner), ideal for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Column 0 (rows 0-3: [8,4,4,2]):  \n  - Tiles shift down: 0,8,8,2 (4s merge into 8, score +8).  \n- Column 1 (rows 0-3: [2,0,0,0]):  \n  - Tiles shift down to [0,0,0,2] (no merges).  \n- Columns 2-3: All zeros (no changes).  \n- Result: Merges 4s in column 0 for 8 points, but 8s stack in the middle of column 0, less ideal for corner-based strategy.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP and DOWN both merge 4s for 8 points, but UP positions the 8s in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), making future merges (e.g., 8+8=16) more accessible. LEFT and RIGHT are less optimal due to fewer merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|2|2|0  \nRow 1: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|4|0|0  \n\n\n### 1. Swipe LEFT  \n- **Row 0**: [8, 2, 2, 0] → 8 and 2s shift left. The two 2s merge into 4, resulting in 8|4|0|0 (score +4).  \n- **Row 1**: [8, 0, 0, 0] → 8 shifts left, no merge: 8|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 2**: [2, 0, 0, 0] → 2 shifts left, no merge: 2|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 4, 0, 0] → 4 shifts left, no merge: 4|0|0|0.  \n- **Outcome**: Only a small merge (2+2=4) in Row 0. Larger tiles (8s) remain scattered.  \n\n\n### 2. Swipe RIGHT  \n- **Row 0**: [8, 2, 2, 0] → 8 shifts right, 2s merge into 4, resulting in 0|8|4|0 (score +4).  \n- **Row 1**: [8, 0, 0, 0] → 8 shifts right: 0|0|0|8.  \n- **Row 2**: [2, 0, 0, 0] → 2 shifts right: 0|0|0|2.  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 4, 0, 0] → 4 shifts right: 0|0|0|4.  \n- **Outcome**: Only a small merge (2+2=4) in Row 0. Larger tiles (8s) are moved to the right but not aligned for future merges.  \n\n\n### 3. Swipe UP  \n- **Column 0**: [8 (Row 0), 8 (Row 1), 2 (Row 2), 0 (Row 3)] → 8s merge into 16 (Row 0), 2 shifts up to Row 1: 16|2|0|0 (score +16).  \n- **Column 1**: [2 (Row 0), 0 (Row 1), 0 (Row 2), 4 (Row 3)] → 2 and 4 shift up, no merge: 2|4|0|0.  \n- **Column 2**: [2 (Row 0), 0 (Row 1), 0 (Row 2), 0 (Row 3)] → 2 shifts up: 2|0|0|0.  \n- **Column 3**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Outcome**: Merges the two 8s into 16 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), providing a large score boost (16). Larger tiles are consolidated for future merges.  \n\n\n### 4. Swipe DOWN  \n- **Column 0**: [8 (Row 0), 8 (Row 1), 2 (Row 2), 0 (Row 3)] → 8s merge into 16 (Row 2), 2 shifts down to Row 3: 0|0|16|2 (score +16).  \n- **Column 1**: [2 (Row 0), 0 (Row 1), 0 (Row 2), 4 (Row 3)] → 2 and 4 shift down, no merge: 0|0|2|4.  \n- **Column 2**: [2 (Row 0), 0 (Row 1), 0 (Row 2), 0 (Row 3)] → 2 shifts down: 0|0|0|2.  \n- **Column 3**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 8s into 16 but places it in Row 2, which is not as strategic as the top-left corner.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nSwiping UP merges the two 8s into 16 in the top-left corner (a critical strategic position) and provides the highest immediate score (16). This move consolidates larger tiles and sets up future merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|2|2|2\nRow 1: 2|4|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two adjacent 2s (positions 1 and 2) merge into 4 (score +4), and the remaining 2 (position 3) shifts left. Result: `16|4|2|0`.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left (no merging, as 2 and 4 are distinct). Result: `2|4|0|0`.\n- Rows 2 and 3: Remain all 0s.\n- Outcome: The 16 (largest tile) stays in the top-left corner, and merging 2s in Row 0 improves scoring potential.\n\n### RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two rightmost 2s (positions 2 and 3) merge into 4 (score +4), and the remaining 2 (position 1) shifts right. Result: `16|0|2|4`.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right (no merging). Result: `0|0|2|4`.\n- Rows 2 and 3: Remain all 0s.\n- Outcome: The 16 stays in the top-left corner, but merging occurs less effectively, and smaller tiles are scattered on the right.\n\n### UP Swipe:\n- All non-zero tiles are already in the top positions of their columns (no movement or merging possible). This is an invalid move, as no tiles shift or merge.\n\n### DOWN Swipe:\n- Tiles shift downward, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in columns to merge. Result: Tiles cluster at the bottom (e.g., Row 2: `16|2|0|0`, Row 3: `2|4|2|2`), but no merging occurs (score +0). The 16 moves to Row 2, reducing corner stability.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nLEFT is optimal.

Columns are processed for merges:  \n  - **Column 1**: Tiles [4, 4, 0, 2] shift up to [4, 4, 2, 0]. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8). The 2 shifts to row 1.  \n  - Other columns: No merges (distinct or non-adjacent tiles).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  Row 0: 16|8|2|0  \n  Row 1: 2|2|0|0  \n  Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n- Score gain: 8. Larger tiles (16, 8) are positioned in the top-left corner, a strategic advantage for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles shift downward. Columns are processed for merges:  \n  - **Column 1**: Tiles [4, 4, 0, 2] shift down to [0, 4, 4, 2]. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8). The 2 remains in row 3.  \n  - Other columns: No merges (distinct or non-adjacent tiles).  \n- Resulting board:  \n  Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 16|8|0|0  \n  Row 3: 2|2|2|0  \n- Score gain: 8. Larger tiles (16, 8) are in row 2, less optimal for future merges compared to the top-left corner.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP is the best move. It merges two 4s into an 8 (gaining 8 points), positions larger tiles (16, 8) in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and leaves row 1 with adjacent 2s that can merge in future moves.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the current game board and merging rules.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|8|2|0\nRow 1: 2|2|0|8\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. No merges (16, 8, 2 remain; 0 fills the rightmost spot). New row: `16|8|2|0`.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left. The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), and the 8 shifts left.

However, DOWN consolidates the merged 16s in the bottom row (row 3), aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (bottom-left in this case). This positioning allows for future merges (e.g., swiping left to merge the adjacent 16s in row 3 into 32) while keeping smaller tiles (4 in row 2) isolated and less disruptive.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their effects on the game board.

Invalid move (no valid shifts or merges).  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: All zeros, no change.  \n   - Row 1: [2,0,0,0] → 2 shifts right to [0,0,0,2].  \n   - Row 2: [16,0,0,0] → 16 shifts right to [0,0,0,16].  \n   - Row 3: [4,16,2,4] → No zeros, so tiles remain in place.  \n   - **Result**: Tiles in Rows 1 and 2 shift right, but no merges occur.

The goal is to maximize merges, keep larger tiles in corners, and set up future moves.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 16 | 2 | 4  \nRow 1: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 4 | 0 | 0 | 4  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- Row 0: No merges (tiles are already left-aligned).  \n- Row 1: 16 stays left-aligned (no merges).  \n- Row 2: Two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in `8 | 0 | 0 | 0`.  \n- Row 3: No changes.  \n- Result: Larger tiles (16, 8) are spread in the left column, with limited future merge potential.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Row 0: No merges (tiles are already right-aligned).  \n- Row 1: 16 shifts to the rightmost column (no merges).  \n- Row 2: Two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in `0 | 0 | 0 | 8`.  \n- Row 3: No changes.  \n- Result: Larger tiles (16, 8) are in the right column, but the top row remains fragmented.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Column 0: Tiles shift up (no merges).  \n- Column 1: 16 stays top-aligned (no merges).  \n- Column 2: 2 stays top-aligned (no merges).  \n- Column 3: Two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in `8 | 0 | 0 | 0` in the top row.  \n- Result: 8 is in the top-right corner, but the 16 in row 0, column 1 blocks potential merges of adjacent 2s.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Column 0: Tiles shift down (2 → row 1, 16 → row 2, 4 → row 3).  \n- Column 1: 16 shifts down to row 3 (rightmost position).  \n- Column 2: 2 shifts down to row 3.  \n- Column 3: Two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), resulting in `0 | 0 | 0 | 8` in the bottom row.  \n- Result: 8 is in the bottom-right corner (a strategic corner), and 16s are positioned in the bottom row (row 3, column 1) and row 2, column 0. This setup allows future merges by shifting tiles toward the bottom-right corner.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN swipe moves the merged 8 to the bottom-right corner (a key strategic position) and positions larger tiles (16s) in the bottom row, setting up for future merges. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners and maximizing long-term potential.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game board and rules:\n\n### Game Board (Current State):\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 16|4|0|0  \nRow 3: 4|16|2|8  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### 1. LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.  \n- **Row 1**: [2,0,0,0] → [2,0,0,0] (no movement, already leftmost).  \n- **Row 2**: [16,4,0,0] → [16,4,0,0] (no movement, already leftmost).  \n- **Row 3**: [4,16,2,8] → [4,16,2,8] (no movement, no adjacent zeros).  \n- **Result**: No tiles move or merge. **Invalid move** (no valid movement).  \n\n\n#### 2. RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.  \n- **Row 1**: [2,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,2] (moves right into empty spaces).  \n- **Row 2**: [16,4,0,0] → [0,0,16,4] (moves right into empty spaces).  \n- **Row 3**: [4,16,2,8] → [4,16,2,8] (no movement, already rightmost).  \n- **Result**: Tiles in Row 1 and Row 2 shift right. No merging occurs. **Valid move** (tiles move), but no immediate score gain.  \n\n\n#### 3. UP Swipe:\n- **Column 0** (vertical): [0,2,16,4] → [2,16,4,0] (tiles shift up).  \n- **Column 1** (vertical): [0,0,4,16] → [4,16,0,0] (tiles shift up).  \n- **Column 2** (vertical): [0,0,0,2] → [2,0,0,0] (tile shifts up).  \n- **Column 3** (vertical): [0,0,0,8] → [8,0,0,0] (tile shifts up).  \n- **Post-Shift Board**:  \n  Row 0: 2|4|2|8  \n  Row 1: 16|16|0|0  \n  Row 2: 4|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n- **Key Observation**: Row 1 now has adjacent 16s (16|16|0|0), which can merge into 32 with a subsequent LEFT swipe, creating a high-value tile.  \n- **Result**: Tiles move up, creating a strategic setup for future merges. **Valid move** with potential for score gain.  \n\n\n#### 4. DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: [0,2,16,4] → [0,2,16,4] (no movement, tiles already as low as possible).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,4,16] → [0,0,4,16] (no movement, tiles already as low as possible).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,2] → [0,0,0,2] (no movement, tile already at the bottom).  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,8] → [0,0,0,8] (no movement, tile already at the bottom).  \n- **Result**: No tiles move or merge. **Invalid move**.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe is the best choice because it shifts tiles upward, creating adjacent 16s in Row 1. This sets up a strategic opportunity to merge these 16s into 32 with a subsequent LEFT swipe, maximizing future score potential.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize score and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 4 | 2 | 8\nRow 1: 16 | 16 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 8 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   - Row 0: `[2, 4, 2, 8]` (no merges, as all tiles are distinct).  \n   - Row 1: `[16, 16, 0, 0]` → merges into `[32, 0, 0, 0]` (score +32).  \n   - Row 2: `[4, 0, 0, 0]` (no merges, shifts left to `[4, 0, 0, 0]`).  \n   - Row 3: `[0, 0, 8, 0]` (no merges, shifts left to `[8, 0, 0, 0]`).  \n   - Result: 32 is placed in Row 1, Column 0 (top-left corner).  \n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - Row 0: `[2, 4, 2, 8]` (no merges, as all tiles are distinct).  \n   - Row 1: `[16, 16, 0, 0]` → merges into `[0, 0, 0, 32]` (score +32).  \n   - Row 2: `[4, 0, 0, 0]` (no merges, shifts right to `[0, 0, 0, 4]`).  \n   - Row 3: `[0, 0, 8, 0]` (no merges, shifts right to `[0, 0, 0, 8]`).  \n   - Result: 32 is placed in Row 1, Column 3 (top-right corner).  \n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   - Columns are processed top-to-bottom. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in columns are equal. Score remains 0.  \n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom-to-top. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in columns are equal. Score remains 0.  \n\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Scoring**: Only LEFT and RIGHT moves generate a score (32 points from merging the two 16s in Row 1).  \n- **Strategy**: The goal is to keep larger tiles in corners. Both LEFT and RIGHT moves place the merged 32 in a corner (top-left or top-right). However, the top-right corner (from RIGHT) is more strategic, as it aligns with common 2048 strategies to concentrate large tiles in a corner and leave smaller tiles spread out for future merges.  \n\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on their impact on merging tiles, score gain, and future strategic positioning.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 2|4|2|8\nRow 1: 0|0|0|32\nRow 2: 0|0|0|4\nRow 3: 0|4|0|8\n```\n\n### LEFT\/RIGHT Moves:\n- **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all tiles in each row are distinct or already at the left edge).  \n- **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (all tiles in each row are distinct or already at the right edge).  \n\nNeither LEFT nor RIGHT generates merges, so they are suboptimal.\n\n### UP Move:\n- **Column 1 (vertical)**: Contains `4` (Row 0), `0` (Row 1), `0` (Row 2), `4` (Row 3). When moving UP, the two `4`s merge into `8` (score +8).  \n- Other columns (0, 2, 3) have no merges (distinct tiles or no adjacent duplicates).  \n\nResulting board after UP:\n```\nRow 0: 2|8|2|8  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|32  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|8  \n```\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- **Column 1 (vertical)**: Contains `4` (Row 0), `0` (Row 1), `0` (Row 2), `4` (Row 3). When moving DOWN, the two `4`s merge into `8` (score +8).  \n- Other columns (0, 2, 3) have no merges (distinct tiles or no adjacent duplicates).  \n\nResulting board after DOWN:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|32  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 3: 2|8|2|8  \n```\n\n### Strategic Comparison:\nBoth UP and DOWN generate a merge of `4`s into `8` (score +8). However, DOWN is more strategic because:  \n- Larger tiles (32, 8, 4, 8) are consolidated in Column 3 (a corner), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.  \n- Future moves (e.g., another DOWN) could merge the `8`s in Column 3 (Row 0 and Row 3) into `16`, creating a higher-value tile.  \n\nThus, DOWN is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|8\nRow 1: 0|0|0|32\nRow 2: 16|0|0|4\nRow 3: 2|8|2|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,0,8] → Shifts left to [8,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,32] → Shifts left to [32,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [16,0,0,4] → Shifts left to [16,4,0,0] (no merges, 16 ≠ 4).  \n- **Row 3**: [2,8,2,8] → No merges (no adjacent equal tiles), remains [2,8,2,8].  \n\nAfter LEFT swipe, the board becomes:  \n```\nRow 0: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 32|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 16|4|0|0  \nRow 3: 2|8|2|8  \n```  \nNo merges occur (score 0), but larger tiles (8, 32, 16) are shifted left, creating empty spaces on the right for future merges.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,0,8] → Already right-aligned, no change.  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,32] → Already right-aligned, no change.  \n- **Row 2**: [16,0,0,4] → Shifts right to [0,0,16,4] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [2,8,2,8] → No merges (no adjacent equal tiles), remains [2,8,2,8].  \n\nAfter RIGHT swipe, the board remains mostly unchanged, with no merges (score 0). Larger tiles stay right-aligned but fail to create useful empty spaces.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [0,0,16,2] → Shifts up to [16,2,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,8] → Shifts up to [8,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,2] → Shifts up to [2,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [8,32,4,8] → No merges (no adjacent equal tiles), remains [8,32,4,8].  \n\nAfter UP swipe, the board becomes:  \n```\nRow 0: 16|8|2|8  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|32  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|8  \n```  \nNo merges occur (score 0), but smaller tiles (16, 8, 2) clutter the top row, reducing future merging potential.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [0,0,16,2] → Already bottom-aligned, no change.  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,8] → Already bottom-aligned, no change.  \n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,2] → Already bottom-aligned, no change.  \n- **Column 3**: [8,32,4,8] → No merges (no adjacent equal tiles), remains [8,32,4,8].  \n\nAfter DOWN swipe, the board remains unchanged (score 0), with no meaningful tile repositioning.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe shifts larger tiles (8, 32, 16) to the left edge, creating empty spaces on the right. This strategic positioning allows for future merges by moving smaller tiles into these empty spaces, aligning with the goal of keeping larger tiles in a corner. Other directions either fail to reposition tiles usefully or clutter the board.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on strategic goals such as grouping tiles for future merges and positioning larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|0|0\nRow 1: 32|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|4|0|2\nRow 3: 2|8|2|8\n```\nKey observations:\n- No adjacent tiles of the same number exist, so no immediate merges are possible.\n- Many empty tiles (zeros) allow tiles to shift in any direction.\n- Larger tiles (32, 16, 8) are concentrated in the left column, suggesting a potential corner strategy (top-left).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. Row 0 and 1 remain unchanged (already left-aligned). Row 2 becomes `16|4|2|0` (shifting 2 left), and Row 3 remains `2|8|2|8` (no zeros to shift into). This does not meaningfully group tiles for future merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right. Row 0 becomes `0|0|0|8`, Row 1 becomes `0|0|0|32`, Row 2 becomes `0|16|4|2`, and Row 3 remains `2|8|2|8`. This moves larger tiles (8, 32) to the right edge but does not create adjacency for future merges.\n\n3. **UP**: Tiles shift upward. Columns are processed top-to-bottom:\n   - Column 0: `8|32|16|2` (no shift, all non-zero).\n   - Column 1: `0|0|4|8` → shifts to `4|8|0|0` (4 and 8 move up).\n   - Column 2: `0|0|0|2` → shifts to `2|0|0|0` (2 moves up).\n   - Column 3: `0|0|2|8` → shifts to `2|8|0|0` (2 and 8 move up).\n\n   After UP, the board becomes:\n   ```\n   Row 0: 8|4|2|2\n   Row 1: 32|8|0|8\n   Row 2: 16|0|0|0\n   Row 3: 2|0|0|0\n   ```\n   Notably, Row 0 now has adjacent 2s (`2|2` in columns 2-3), which can merge with a subsequent LEFT move. This sets up future merges and aligns with the strategy of grouping smaller tiles for progression.\n\n4. **DOWN**: Tiles shift downward, but no meaningful shifts occur (most tiles are already at the bottom of their columns). The board remains nearly unchanged, offering no strategic advantage.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move. It shifts smaller tiles upward, creating adjacency (2s in Row 0) for future merges and maintains larger tiles (32, 16, 8) in the top-left corner, a strategic position for long-term progression.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, score gain, and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board (rows 0-3):\n- Row 0: 8|4|2|2  \n- Row 1: 32|8|0|8  \n- Row 2: 16|0|0|16  \n- Row 3: 2|0|0|0  \n\n\n### LEFT Move:\nTiles shift left, merging adjacent equal values:\n- **Row 0**: [8,4,2,2] → 8,4, (2+2=4), 0 → Score +4.  \n- **Row 1**: [32,8,0,8] → 32, (8+8=16), 0, 0 → Score +16.  \n- **Row 2**: [16,0,0,16] → (16+16=32), 0, 0, 0 → Score +32.  \n- **Row 3**: [2,0,0,0] → 2,0,0,0 (no merge).  \n\nTotal score gain: 4 + 16 + 32 = 52.  \nResulting board (rows 0-3):  \n8|4|4|0  \n32|16|0|0  \n32|0|0|0  \n2|0|0|0  \n\n\n### RIGHT Move:\nTiles shift right, merging adjacent equal values:\n- **Row 0**: [8,4,2,2] → 8,4,0, (2+2=4) → Score +4.  \n- **Row 1**: [32,8,0,8] → 32,0,0, (8+8=16) → Score +16.  \n- **Row 2**: [16,0,0,16] → 0,0,0, (16+16=32) → Score +32.  \n- **Row 3**: [2,0,0,0] → 0,0,0,2 (no merge).  \n\nTotal score gain: 4 + 16 + 32 = 52.  \nResulting board (rows 0-3):  \n8|4|0|4  \n32|0|0|16  \n0|0|0|32  \n0|0|0|2  \n\n\n### UP\/DOWN Moves:\n- **UP**: Columns are processed.

No adjacent equal tiles exist after shifting (e.g., column 0: [8,32,16,2] remains; column 3: [2,8,16,0] shifts to [0,2,8,16]). No merges, score gain = 0.  \n\n\n### Strategic Comparison:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 52 points, but LEFT is better strategically:  \n- LEFT consolidates larger tiles (32s) in the left column (rows 1 and 2), creating vertical adjacency that could merge into 64 with a future UP move.  \n- LEFT leaves 4s in row 0 (columns 2) adjacent, allowing a future LEFT move to merge them into 8.  \n- RIGHT scatters larger tiles (32, 16) in the right column, with less potential for immediate merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

Result: [2, 4, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 0, 0] → No change.  \n\nLEFT merges two pairs (8+8 and 16+16) for a total score of 48 and consolidates larger tiles (32, 64, 32) on the left, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [8, 8, 16, 0] → Shift right, merge 8+8=16 (score +16), then 16+16=32 (score +32). Result: [0, 0, 32, 0].  \n- **Row 1**: [64, 32, 0, 0] → Shift right. Result: [0, 64, 32, 0].  \n- **Row 2**: [2, 4, 0, 0] → Shift right. Result: [0, 2, 4, 0].  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 0, 0] → No change.  \n\nRIGHT also merges two pairs but scatters larger tiles (64, 32) in the middle of the row, which is less strategic for future merges.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are [8, 64, 2, 0], [8, 32, 4, 0], [16, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]. Shifting up causes no merges (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns shifted down also have no adjacent equal tiles, resulting in no merges.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT is optimal as it merges tiles for the highest immediate score and consolidates large tiles on the left, supporting future strategic merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential, tile alignment, and future strategy.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 16 | 0 | 0\nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 2  | 4  | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 0  | 0  | 16| 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **Swipe LEFT**:\n   - **Row 0**: The two 16s merge into 32 (score +32). Result: `32 | 0 | 0 | 0`.\n   - **Row 1**: 64 and 32 are distinct and shift left (no merge). Result: `64 | 32 | 0 | 0`.\n   - **Row 2**: 2 and 4 are distinct and shift left (no merge). Result: `2 | 4 | 0 | 0`.\n   - **Row 3**: The 16 shifts left to column 0. Result: `16 | 0 | 0 | 0`.\n   - **Outcome**: Merges 16s in Row 0 but leaves larger tiles (32, 64, 16) spread across the left column with no immediate future merge potential.\n\n2. **Swipe RIGHT**:\n   - **Row 0**: The two 16s shift right and merge into 32 (score +32). Result: `0 | 0 | 0 | 32`.\n   - **Row 1**: 64 and 32 shift right to columns 2 and 3 (no merge). Result: `0 | 0 | 64 | 32`.\n   - **Row 2**: 2 and 4 shift right to columns 2 and 3 (no merge). Result: `0 | 0 | 2 | 4`.\n   - **Row 3**: The 16 shifts right to column 3. Result: `0 | 0 | 0 | 16`.\n   - **Outcome**: Merges 16s in Row 0 and aligns 32 (Row 0, Column 3) with 32 (Row 1, Column 3) vertically. This creates a future merge opportunity (e.g., swiping UP to merge the two 32s).\n\n3. **Swipe UP**:\n   - Columns are processed, but no adjacent tiles are identical. No merges occur. Tiles shift up but remain unmerged. This move is inefficient as it provides no score or strategic advantage.\n\n4. **Swipe DOWN**:\n   - Columns are processed, but no adjacent tiles are identical. No merges occur. Tiles shift down but remain unmerged. This move is also inefficient.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwipe RIGHT merges the 16s in Row 0 (gaining 32 points) and aligns 32s vertically in Column 3, creating a future merge opportunity. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (top-right) and setting up for subsequent merges. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

No change.  \n- **Row 3**: [2, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right. New row: [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n**Result**: 128 is placed in the top-right corner (row 0, column 3), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.

Larger tiles remain scattered, making this move ineffective.  \n\n\n#### 4. **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [4, 0, 0, 2] → Tiles shift down. No merge. New column: [0, 0, 4, 2].  \n- **Column 1**: [0, 0, 0, 0] → No change.  \n- **Column 2**: [64, 2, 0, 0] → Tiles shift down. No merge.

All non-zero tiles are already in the rightmost positions (e.g., 128 in Row 0, Column 3; 4 in Row 1, Column 3; 16 in Row 2, Column 3; 2 in Row 3, Column 3). No movement or merges occur. **No score gain.**\n\n#### 2. **UP**  \nTiles shift upward. Columns are processed top-to-bottom:  \n- Columns 0 and 1: All zeros, no change.  \n- Column 2: [4 (Row 0), 2 (Row 1), 0 (Row 2), 4 (Row 3)] → Shifts to [4, 2, 4, 0] (no merges, as 4, 2, 4 are distinct).  \n- Column 3: [128, 4, 16, 2] → All distinct, no merges.  \nNo score gain. The board remains nearly unchanged.\n\n#### 3. **DOWN**  \nTiles shift downward. Columns are processed bottom-to-top:  \n- Columns 0 and 1: All zeros, no change.  \n- Column 2: [4 (Row 0), 2 (Row 1), 0 (Row 2), 4 (Row 3)] → Shifts to [0, 4, 2, 4] (no merges, as 4, 2, 4 are distinct).  \n- Column 3: [128, 4, 16, 2] → All distinct, no merges.  \nNo score gain. Minimal tile movement.\n\n#### 4. **LEFT**  \nTiles shift left. Each row is processed leftward:  \n- Row 0: [0, 0, 4, 128] → Shifts to [4, 128, 0, 0] (no merge, 4 ≠ 128).  \n- Row 1: [0, 0, 2, 4] → Shifts to [2, 4, 0, 0] (no merge, 2 ≠ 4).  \n- Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 16] → Shifts to [16, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n- Row 3: [0, 0, 4, 2] → Shifts to [4, 2, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n\nWhile no immediate merges occur, **LEFT** consolidates smaller tiles (4, 2, 16) on the left side, aligning them for potential future merges. Larger tiles (128, 16) are positioned in corners (top-right and bottom-left), which is strategic for long-term progression.\n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT is the best move, as it consolidates tiles for future merges and maintains larger tiles in corners.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|128|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|4|0|0  \nRow 2: 16|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 4|2|64|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all tiles are already as left as possible). The board remains unchanged except for a new tile (2\/4) in an empty space. No strategic benefit.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right. Key observations:  \n   - Row 0: `4|128|0|0` → `0|0|4|128` (128 moves to the top-right corner, a strategic corner for large tiles).  \n   - Row 1: `2|4|0|0` → `0|0|2|4` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: `16|0|0|0` → `0|0|0|16` (16 moves to the bottom-right of its row).  \n   - Row 3: `4|2|64|0` → `0|4|2|64` (64 stays in the right half).  \n   This positions the largest tile (128) in the top-right corner, aligning with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in corners for future merges.  \n\n3. **UP**: Tiles shift up. No merges occur, and large tiles (128, 64, 16) remain scattered. No meaningful improvement.  \n\n4. **DOWN**: Tiles shift down. No merges occur, and large tiles remain spread across the grid. No strategic advantage.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT positions the largest tile (128) in the top-right corner, a critical strategic position for future merges. This aligns with the goal of consolidating large tiles in corners to maximize scoring potential.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

Unlikely to improve tile alignment.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n- Tiles shift right in each row, but all non-zero tiles are already at the right edge.  \n- Result: No movement or merges. Invalid move (no tiles shift).  \n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:  \n- Columns are processed bottom-to-top.  \n  - Column 2 (values: 4, 2, 0, 2) shifts down, merging the two 2s into a 4 (score +4).  \n  - Other columns have no merges (non-zero tiles are distinct or already at the bottom).  \n- Result: Merges 2s in column 2, but leaves 4s in non-adjacent positions (row 1 and row 3 of column 2), limiting future merges.  \n\n#### **UP Swipe**:  \n- Columns are processed top-to-bottom.  \n  - Column 0 (values: 0, 0, 0, 2) shifts up, moving the 2 to row 0 (top).  \n  - Column 1 (values: 0, 0, 0, 4) shifts up, moving the 4 to row 0 (top).  \n  - Column 2 (values: 4, 2, 0, 2) shifts up, merging the two 2s into a 4 (score +4).  \n  - Column 3 (values: 128, 4, 16, 64) has no merges (all distinct).  \n- Result: Merges 2s in column 2, moves small tiles (2, 4) to the top row, and aligns 4s in row 0 (columns 1 and 2) for potential future merges (e.g., a subsequent LEFT swipe could merge these 4s into an 8). The 128 remains in the top-right corner (a strategic corner), supporting long-term growth.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe UP swipe maximizes immediate merges, improves tile alignment for future moves, and keeps the largest tile (128) in a corner.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN.

The 128 stays in the top-right corner, but smaller tiles (4) block larger tiles (16, 64) in the same column, limiting future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: 2, 0, 0, 0 → 2 shifts down. Result: 0 | 0 | 0 | 2.  \n- **Column 1**: 4, 0, 0, 0 → 4 shifts down. Result: 0 | 0 | 0 | 4.  \n- **Column 2**: 4, 4, 0, 16 → 4 and 4 merge to 8 (shifts down); 16 stays.

The goal is to maximize score through tile merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current 4x4 grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 8 | 128 | 0\nRow 1: 32 | 8 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 16 | 0 | 64 | 0\nRow 3: 16 | 64 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [2, 8, 128, 0] → No merges (tiles already shifted left).\n- **Row 1**: [32, 8, 0, 0] → No merges (tiles already shifted left).\n- **Row 2**: [16, 0, 64, 0] → Shifts to [16, 64, 0, 0] (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: [16, 64, 0, 0] → Shifts to [16, 64, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges, no score gain.\n\n### RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [2, 8, 128, 0] → Shifts to [0, 2, 8, 128] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [32, 8, 0, 0] → Shifts to [0, 0, 32, 8] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [16, 0, 64, 0] → Shifts to [0, 0, 16, 64] (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: [16, 64, 0, 0] → Shifts to [0, 0, 16, 64] (no merges).  \n**Result**: No merges, no score gain.\n\n### UP Swipe:\nColumns are processed top to bottom, with merges checked after shifting.  \n- **Column 0**: [2, 32, 16, 16] → Shifts up, merges 16s (row 2 and 3) into 32 (score +32). New column: [2, 32, 32, 0].  \n- **Column 1**: [8, 8, 0, 64] → Shifts up, merges 8s (row 0 and 1) into 16 (score +16). New column: [16, 64, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 2**: [128, 0, 64, 0] → Shifts up, no merges.

Larger tiles (128, 64s) are positioned in the top-right corner, a strategic corner for future merges.\n\n### DOWN Swipe:\nColumns are processed bottom to top, with merges checked after shifting.  \n- **Column 0**: [2, 32, 16, 16] → Shifts down, merges 16s (row 2 and 3) into 32 (score +32).

Larger tiles (128, 64s) are in the bottom-right corner but less centralized for future merges compared to UP.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and DOWN yield 48 points, but UP positions the 128 (largest tile) in the top-right corner with adjacent 64s in row 1, setting up for future merges (e.g., swiping right to merge 64s into 128). This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 2 | 16 | 128 | 0  \nRow 1: 32 | 64 | 64 | 32  \nRow 2: 32 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### 1. LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left, no merges (remains [2, 16, 128, 0]).  \n- **Row 1**: 64 and 64 merge into 128 (score +128), resulting in [32, 128, 32, 0].  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left, no merges (remains [32, 0, 0, 0]).  \n- **Row 3**: No change.  \n- **Result**: 128 in Row 0, Column 2 (not a corner), and 128 in Row 1, Column 1 (suboptimal placement).  \n\n\n#### 2. RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right, no merges (becomes [0, 2, 16, 128]).  \n- **Row 1**: 64 and 64 merge into 128 (score +128), resulting in [0, 32, 128, 32].  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right (becomes [0, 0, 0, 32]).  \n- **Row 3**: No change.  \n- **Result**: 128 in Row 0, Column 3 (top-right corner, an ideal corner for large tiles). The 128 in Row 1, Column 2 is adjacent to smaller tiles, leaving room for future merges.  \n\n\n#### 3. UP Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: 32 (Row 1) and 32 (Row 2) merge into 64 (score +64), resulting in [2, 64, 0, 0].  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles shift up (remains [16, 64, 0, 0]).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles shift up (remains [128, 64, 0, 0]).  \n- **Column 3**: 32 (Row 1) shifts up to Row 0 (becomes [32, 0, 0, 0]).  \n- **Result**: 128 remains in Row 0, Column 2 (not a corner), and only a 64 merge (lower score than LEFT\/RIGHT).  \n\n\n#### 4. DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: 32 (Row 1) and 32 (Row 2) merge into 64 (score +64), resulting in [0, 2, 0, 64].  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles shift down (becomes [0, 0, 16, 64]).  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles shift down (becomes [0, 0, 128, 64]).  \n- **Column 3**: 32 (Row 1) shifts down to Row 3 (becomes [0, 0, 0, 32]).  \n- **Result**: 128 moves to Row 2, Column 2 (suboptimal placement), and only a 64 merge (lower score than LEFT\/RIGHT).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT swipe merges the 64s in Row 1 (score +128) and positions the 128 in the top-right corner, a strategic corner for large tiles. This aligns with the goal of keeping large tiles in corners and maximizing future merging potential.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score through merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 2 | 16 | 128  \nRow 1: 0 | 32 | 128 | 32  \nRow 2: 8 | 0 | 0 | 32  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all tiles in rows are distinct or non-adjacent). No score gain.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (tiles remain non-adjacent). No score gain.  \n3. **UP**: Tiles shift upward. In column 3, the two 32s (row 1 and row 2) merge into 64, adding 64 to the score. The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 8 | 2 | 16 | 128  \n   Row 1: 0 | 32 | 128 | 64  \n   Row 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   ```  \n   Larger tiles (128, 64) are in the top-right area, but no clear future merges are set up.  \n\n4. **DOWN**: Tiles shift downward. In column 3, the two 32s (row 1 and row 2) merge into 64 (adding 64 to the score). Additionally, the 128 in row 0, column 3 shifts to row 3, column 3, and the 128 in row 1, column 2 shifts to row 3, column 2. This positions two 128s adjacent horizontally in row 3, columns 2 and 3. The board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 2: 0 | 2 | 16 | 64  \n   Row 3: 8 | 32 | 128 | 128  \n   ```  \n   The adjacent 128s in row 3 set up a future merge (e.g., with a LEFT swipe, they would merge into 256), making this a strategically better move.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is optimal because it merges 32s into 64 (scoring 64) and positions two 128s adjacently in the bottom row, enabling future high-value merges.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners). The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 64|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|2|16|128  \nRow 3: 8|32|128|64  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: `64|0|0|0` → Tiles shift left, remains `64|0|0|0` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: `0|0|0|0` → No change.  \n   - Row 2: `0|2|16|128` → Tiles shift left to `2|16|128|0` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: `8|32|128|64` → Tiles are already leftmost, remains `8|32|128|64` (no merges).  \n   - **Key Observation**: After moving LEFT, the 128 in Row 2, Column 2 and the 128 in Row 3, Column 2 become vertically adjacent. This sets up a potential merge (into 256) in the next move (e.g., UP), which is strategically valuable.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: `64|0|0|0` → Tiles shift right to `0|0|0|64` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: `0|0|0|0` → No change.  \n   - Row 2: `0|2|16|128` → Tiles are already rightmost, remains `0|2|16|128` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: `8|32|128|64` → Tiles are already rightmost, remains `8|32|128|64` (no merges).  \n   - **Result**: No merges or strategic positioning of large tiles.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns shift upward, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). The resulting board groups tiles in the top rows but does not create adjacent large tiles for future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns shift downward, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). The resulting board remains similar to the original, with no strategic advantage.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT positions the two 128s (Row 2, Column 2 and Row 3, Column 2) vertically adjacent, creating a future merge opportunity (e.g., UP) to form a 256 tile.

Larger tiles (e.g., 256, 128, 64) remain scattered, offering no strategic advantage.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles in columns shift downward into empty spaces. Key observations:  \n     - The 256 (row 0, column 2) moves to row 3, column 2.  \n     - The 64 (row 0, column 3) moves to row 3, column 3.  \n     - The 128 (row 3, column 0) stays in place.  \n   - After moving DOWN, the bottom row (row 3) becomes `128 | 32 | 256 | 64`, consolidating larger tiles (128, 256, 64) in the bottom row.

The two 64s merge into 128 (score +128), resulting in [0, 0, 128, 32].  \n- Other rows: No merges.  \n\nAfter merging, the 128 is placed in row 0, column 2 (not a corner), which is less optimal than the top-left corner from a LEFT swipe.\n\n#### **UP\/DOWN Swipes**  \n- **UP Swipe**: Merges two 32s in column 3 into 64 (score +64), but no significant merges elsewhere.  \n- **DOWN Swipe**: Merges two 32s in column 3 into 64 (score +64), with no other merges.  \n\nBoth UP and DOWN yield lower scores (64) compared to LEFT\/RIGHT (128).\n\n### Conclusion  \nLEFT swipe provides the highest score (128) and strategically positions the merged 128 in the top-left corner, aligning with the goal of keeping large tiles in corners.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize immediate score and position tiles strategically (e.g., keeping larger tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 32 | 0 | 0\nRow 1: 2 | 32 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 8 | 2\nRow 3: 128 | 32 | 256 | 64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. All rows have no adjacent duplicates or empty spaces between tiles to allow merging. No score is gained. **Not optimal**.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur. Similar to LEFT, no adjacent duplicates or empty spaces between tiles enable merging. No score is gained. **Not optimal**.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Columns are processed upward. In Column 1 (values: 32, 32, 16, 32), the two 32s in Rows 0 and 1 merge into 64 (score +64). Other columns have no merges. The resulting board has 256 in Row 1, Column 2 (middle row), which is less ideal for corner strategy.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Columns are processed downward. In Column 1 (values: 32, 32, 16, 32), the two 32s in Rows 0 and 1 (after shifting down) merge into 64 (score +64). The 256 remains in Row 3, Column 2 (bottom row), which aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners. The bottom row (128, 64, 256, 64) positions 256 adjacent to 64s, potentially enabling future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP and DOWN both yield 64 points, but DOWN keeps the 256 in the bottom row (better for corner strategy) and positions smaller tiles to allow future merges. Thus, DOWN is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize future merging potential and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 16 | 0 | 0\nRow 1: 2 | 64 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 8 | 2\nRow 3: 128 | 32 | 256 | 64\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles in rows 0 and 1 are already left-aligned (no zeros to shift into), and rows 2 and 3 are full. No tiles move or merge. **No valid change.**\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles `128` and `16` shift right to columns 2 and 3 → `0 | 0 | 128 | 16`.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles `2` and `64` shift right to columns 2 and 3 → `0 | 0 | 2 | 64`.  \n   - Rows 2 and 3: Already full (no zeros), so no change.  \n   This move shifts smaller tiles to the right, freeing left columns and creating space for future merges. **Valid move with no immediate merges but strategic setup.**\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns 2 and 3 (originally with zeros) shift tiles upward:  \n     - Column 2: `8` (row 2) and `256` (row 3) shift to rows 0 and 1 → `8 | 256 | 0 | 0`.  \n     - Column 3: `2` (row 2) and `64` (row 3) shift to rows 0 and 1 → `2 | 64 | 0 | 0`.  \n   - Other columns remain unchanged (no merges). **Valid move but less strategic for future merges.**\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   All non-zero tiles are already as low as possible (no zeros to shift into). No tiles move or merge. **No valid change.**\n\n### Strategic Rationale:\nThe RIGHT swipe is optimal because it shifts smaller tiles (128, 16 in row 0; 2, 64 in row 1) to the right, freeing left columns. This setup creates space for larger tiles (e.g., the 128s in column 0) to potentially merge in future moves. Additionally, the 64 in row 1, column 3 (after RIGHT) aligns with the 64 in row 3, column 3, setting up a possible merge with a subsequent DOWN swipe.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0 | 128 | 128 | 16  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 2 | 64  \nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 8 | 2  \nRow 3: 128 | 32 | 256 | 64  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0, 128, 128, 16] → Shift left, merging the two 128s into 256. New row: [256, 16, 0, 0]. Score +256.  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 2, 64] → Shift left, tiles become [2, 64, 0, 0]. No merge.  \n- **Row 2**: [8, 16, 8, 2] → No adjacent equal tiles; remains unchanged.  \n- **Row 3**: [128, 32, 256, 64] → No adjacent equal tiles; remains unchanged.  \n\nThe 256 merges in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for large tiles), improving future merge potential.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0, 128, 128, 16] → Shift right, merging the two 128s into 256. New row: [0, 0, 256, 16]. Score +256.  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 2, 64] → Shift right; remains [0, 0, 2, 64]. No merge.  \n- **Row 2**: [8, 16, 8, 2] → No adjacent equal tiles; remains unchanged.  \n- **Row 3**: [128, 32, 256, 64] → No adjacent equal tiles; remains unchanged.  \n\nThe 256 merges in column 2 of row 0, which is not a corner, making it less strategic for future moves.\n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed by shifting tiles upward. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges occur. No score gain.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed by shifting tiles downward. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges occur. No score gain.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the 128s in row 0 for a 256 tile. However, LEFT places the 256 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for large tiles), which is better for future merges. UP and DOWN provide no merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, maintaining large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 256 | 16 | 0 | 16  \nRow 1: 2 | 64 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 8 | 2  \nRow 3: 128 | 32 | 256 | 64  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [256, 16, 0, 16] → Shift left, then merge adjacent 16s → [256, 32, 0, 0] (score +32).  \n- **Row 1**: [2, 64, 0, 0] → Shift left (no merges) → [2, 64, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 2**: [8, 16, 8, 2] → No merges (all tiles distinct) → remains [8, 16, 8, 2].  \n- **Row 3**: [128, 32, 256, 64] → No merges (all tiles distinct) → remains [128, 32, 256, 64].  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 16s in Row 0, keeping 256 in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for large tiles).  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [256, 16, 0, 16] → Shift right, then merge adjacent 16s → [0, 256, 32, 0] (score +32).  \n- **Row 1**: [2, 64, 0, 0] → Shift right (no merges) → [0, 0, 2, 64].  \n- **Row 2**: [8, 16, 8, 2] → No merges (all tiles distinct) → remains [8, 16, 8, 2].  \n- **Row 3**: [128, 32, 256, 64] → No merges (all tiles distinct) → remains [128, 32, 256, 64].  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 16s in Row 0 but moves 256 to the second column (not a corner), which is suboptimal for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [256, 2, 8, 128] → No merges (all distinct).  \n- **Column 1**: [16, 64, 16, 32] → No merges (all distinct).  \n- **Column 2**: [0, 0, 8, 256] → Shift up → [8, 256, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [16, 0, 2, 64] → Shift up → [16, 2, 64, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Outcome**: No merges, leaving large tiles scattered.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [256, 2, 8, 128] → No merges (all distinct).  \n- **Column 1**: [16, 64, 16, 32] → No merges (all distinct).  \n- **Column 2**: [0, 0, 8, 256] → Shift down → [0, 0, 8, 256] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [16, 0, 2, 64] → Shift down → [0, 16, 2, 64] (no merges).  \n- **Outcome**: No merges, leaving large tiles scattered.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT is the best move. It merges 16s in Row 0 (scoring 32) while keeping the largest tile (256) in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 256|32|0|0\nRow 1: 2|64|0|2\nRow 2: 8|16|8|2\nRow 3: 128|32|256|64\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The only adjacent equal tiles are the two `2`s in Column 3 (Row 1 and Row 2). Merging these will generate a `4` and score points.\n- Other tiles are either non-adjacent or not equal, so no other merges are possible in any direction except for these two `2`s.\n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   - Swiping LEFT or RIGHT does not merge any tiles. Tiles shift but remain unmerged (e.g., Row 1: `2|64|0|2` shifts to `2|64|2|0` when swiped LEFT, but no merges occur). These moves do not contribute to scoring and leave the board structure largely unchanged.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - Swiping UP moves tiles upward. In Column 3, the two `2`s (Row 1 and Row 2) merge into a `4` (score +4). The merged `4` moves to Row 0, Column 3, and the `64` in Row 3, Column 3 shifts up to Row 1, Column 3.  \n   - Resulting board after UP (before new tile spawn):  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 256|32|8|4  \n     Row 1: 2|64|256|64  \n     Row 2: 8|16|0|0  \n     Row 3: 128|32|0|0  \n     ```\n   - This consolidates tiles upward, keeping the largest tile (`256` in Row 0, Column 0) in a corner and creating empty spaces in lower rows for future tile spawns.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Swiping DOWN moves tiles downward. In Column 3, the two `2`s (Row 1 and Row 2) merge into a `4` (score +4). The merged `4` moves to Row 2, Column 3, and the `64` in Row 3, Column 3 remains in place.  \n   - Resulting board after DOWN (before new tile spawn):  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 256|32|0|0  \n     Row 1: 2|64|0|0  \n     Row 2: 8|16|8|4  \n     Row 3: 128|32|256|64  \n     ```\n   - This leaves empty spaces in upper rows but does not meaningfully consolidate larger tiles into a corner.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is preferred because it merges the `2`s into a `4` while consolidating tiles upward, keeping the largest tile (`256`) in the top-left corner. This structure is more strategic for future merges and maintaining control over the board.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify which move maximizes strategic potential (e.g., merging opportunities, preserving large tiles in corners, or creating space for future moves).\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 256 | 32 | 8 | 4  \nRow 1: 2 | 64 | 256 | 64  \nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 2 | 0  \nRow 3: 128 | 32 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles (256, 32, 8, 4) are distinct and non-zero; no merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (2, 64, 256, 64) are distinct and non-zero; no merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (8, 16, 2, 0) shift left but remain (8, 16, 2, 0) (no merging).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles (128, 32, 0, 0) shift left but remain (128, 32, 0, 0) (no merging).  \n- **Outcome**: No merges. Large tiles (256, 128) stay in place, but no strategic improvement.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles (256, 32, 8, 4) are distinct and non-zero; no merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (2, 64, 256, 64) are distinct and non-zero; no merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (8, 16, 2, 0) shift right to (0, 8, 16, 2) (no merging).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles (128, 32, 0, 0) shift right to (0, 0, 128, 32) (no merging).  \n- **Outcome**: No merges. Large tiles (256, 128) are displaced from corners (e.g., 128 moves to column 2), reducing strategic positioning.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles (256, 2, 8, 128) are distinct and non-zero; no merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (32, 64, 16, 32) are distinct and non-zero; no merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles (8, 256, 2, 0) shift up but remain (8, 256, 2, 0) (no merging).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles (4, 64, 0, 0) shift up but remain (4, 64, 0, 0) (no merging).  \n- **Outcome**: No merges. The board remains unchanged, with no improvement in tile arrangement.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: Tiles (256, 2, 8, 128) are distinct and non-zero; no merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles (32, 64, 16, 32) are distinct and non-zero; no merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles (8, 256, 2, 0) shift down to (0, 8, 256, 2) (no merging).  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles (4, 64, 0, 0) shift down to (0, 0, 4, 64) (no merging).  \n- **New Board After Down**:  \n  Row 0: 256 | 32 | 0 | 0  \n  Row 1: 2 | 64 | 8 | 0  \n  Row 2: 8 | 16 | 256 | 4  \n  Row 3: 128 | 32 | 2 | 64  \n- **Outcome**: No immediate merges, but large tiles (256 in row 0, column 0; 128 in row 3, column 0) remain in corners. Smaller tiles are spread out, creating potential for future merges (e.g., 64s in row 3, column 3 and row 1, column 1 could align with future moves).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhile no move results in immediate merges, **DOWN** is the most strategic choice. It preserves large tiles in corners (256 in row 0, column 0; 128 in row 3, column 0) and rearranges smaller tiles to create opportunities for future merges. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile positioning.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 1: 256 | 32 | 16 | 0  \nRow 2: 2 | 64 | 8 | 0  \nRow 3: 8 | 16 | 256 | 4  \nRow 4: 128 | 32 | 2 | 64  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \nTiles shift left in each row. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any row, so no merges occur. The board remains nearly unchanged, with 0s still in row1-col4 and row2-col4.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nTiles shift right in each row. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any row, so no merges occur. The board shifts right, with 0s now in row1-col1 and row2-col1. Larger tiles (256, 128) are scattered, which is suboptimal for future merges.  \n\n#### **UP**  \nTiles shift up in each column. Column 4 (0, 0, 4, 64) shifts up, moving 4 to row1-col4 and 64 to row2-col4. This results in:  \n- Row 1: 256 | 32 | 16 | 4  \n- Row 2: 2 | 64 | 8 | 64  \n- Row 3: 8 | 16 | 256 | 0  \n- Row 4: 128 | 32 | 2 | 0  \n\nNo merges occur, but 0s are now in row3-col4 and row4-col4, freeing space in the bottom rows. Larger tiles (256, 128) remain in stable positions (row1-col1, row3-col3, row4-col1), which is favorable for future merging.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \nTiles shift down in each column. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column, so no merges occur. The board remains unchanged, with 0s still in row1-col4 and row2-col4.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nAll moves are valid (no merges possible), but **UP** optimizes tile positioning by consolidating 0s in the bottom-right, leaving larger tiles (256, 128) in stable corners. This setup improves the potential for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities and keep larger tiles in strategic positions.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 256 | 32 | 16 | 4  \nRow 1: 2 | 64 | 8 | 64  \nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 256 | 0  \nRow 3: 128 | 32 | 2 | 128  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows have no empty spaces (except row 2, which has a 0 at the end). Tiles in each row are already shifted left, so no tiles move or merge. **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 2 (originally `8 | 16 | 256 | 0`) shifts right to `0 | 8 | 16 | 256` (tiles move to fill the empty space). No merges occur. The empty space moves to row 2, column 0. While valid, this spreads the 256 tile (row 2, column 3) away from other large tiles, reducing future merging potential.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 3 (originally `4 | 64 | 0 | 128`) shifts down to `0 | 4 | 64 | 128` (tiles move to fill the empty space). No merges occur. The empty space moves to row 0, column 3. This leaves large tiles (256 in row 0, column 0; 128 in row 3, column 3) in corners but does not create immediate merging opportunities.\n\n4. **UP**:  \n   - Column 3 (originally `4 | 64 | 0 | 128`) shifts up to `4 | 64 | 128 | 0` (tiles move to fill the empty space). No merges occur, but the empty space moves to row 3, column 3. After the move, a new tile (2 or 4) will spawn in the empty space. If the new tile is 2, row 3 becomes `128 | 32 | 2 | 2`, allowing a future left swipe to merge the two 2s into a 4. This creates a strategic merging opportunity, which aligns with the goal of combining smaller tiles to build larger ones.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping **UP** is optimal because it positions the empty space in a location (row 3, column 3) that creates a potential merge of 2s in row 3 if a new 2 spawns there. This supports future strategic merging and maintains larger tiles in corners.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

This means no valid moves can merge tiles or shift tiles into empty spaces. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any direction is technically a valid input (though no merges or shifts occur).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify moves that enable tile merges (to increase the score) or create empty spaces (to allow future moves).

For a move to be valid, there must either be adjacent tiles with the same value (to merge) or empty spaces to shift tiles into. Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend solely on merging adjacent equal tiles.\n2. **Adjacent Tiles Check**:  \n   - **Horizontal**: No adjacent tiles in any row have the same value. For example, Row 1 has \"2, 64, 8, 64,\" but the 64s are separated by an 8 and not adjacent.  \n   - **Vertical**: No adjacent tiles in any column have the same value. For example, Column 1 has \"32, 64, 16, 32,\" but the 32s are separated by 64 and 16 and not adjacent.  \n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Shifting left or right would not merge any tiles (no adjacent equals) and leaves the grid unchanged (no empty spaces to shift into).  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: Shifting up or down would also not merge any tiles (no adjacent equals) and leaves the grid unchanged (no empty spaces to shift into).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full with no adjacent equal tiles, there are no valid moves. However, per the problem’s requirement to select one of the four directions, any direction is technically invalid, but we must choose one.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile positioning.

For example:\n   - Row 0: 256, 32, 16, 4 (all distinct).  \n   - Row 1: 2, 64, 8, 64 (64s are separated by 8, not adjacent).  \n   - Row 2: 8, 16, 256, 128 (all distinct).  \n   - Row 3: 128, 32, 2, 8 (all distinct).  \n   - Columns: All columns also have distinct values (e.g., Column 1: 32, 64, 16, 32—32s are separated by 64 and 16).  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are the same, none of these directions result in merges. However, the goal is to choose a direction that strategically positions tiles for future merges.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nLarger tiles (e.g., 256 in Row 0, Column 0) are ideally kept in corners to minimize disruption. Moving LEFT preserves the 256 in the top-left corner, which is a strong position for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

No merging.  \n- **Outcome**: Row 1 gains a 128, with an empty tile (0) in column 1.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed top-to-bottom. All columns have distinct tiles (e.g., column 0: 256, 2, 8, 128; column 1: 32, 64, 16, 32). No merges occur. Score: +0.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed bottom-to-top. Only column 1 (32, 64, 16, 32) has potential duplicates, but no adjacent merges occur. Score: +0.  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **LEFT** and **RIGHT** both yield +128 from merging the two 64s in Row 1.  \n- **RIGHT** places the merged 128 in the rightmost column (corner), which aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners for future merges.  \n- **LEFT** leaves the 128 in the middle of Row 1, which may be less strategic for future moves.  \n\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic positioning.

However, the problem requires selecting one of the directions. Given the lack of valid merges, any direction is technically invalid, but the task specifies choosing from the options.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to identify potential tile merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles. The game board is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same value. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **LEFT**  \nProcessing each row leftward:  \n- **Row 1 (256|32|16|4):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n- **Row 2 (2|64|8|64):** Tiles 64 are in positions 2 and 4, separated by 8. No adjacency after shifting left; no merges.  \n- **Row 3 (8|16|256|128):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n- **Row 4 (128|32|2|8):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n\n### **RIGHT**  \nProcessing each row rightward:  \n- **Row 1 (256|32|16|4):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n- **Row 2 (2|64|8|64):** Tiles 64 are in positions 2 and 4, separated by 8. No adjacency after shifting right; no merges.  \n- **Row 3 (8|16|256|128):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n- **Row 4 (128|32|2|8):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n\n### **UP**  \nProcessing each column upward:  \n- **Column 1 (256|2|8|128):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n- **Column 2 (32|64|16|32):** Tiles 32 are in positions 1 and 4, separated by 64 and 16. No adjacency after shifting up; no merges.  \n- **Column 3 (16|8|256|2):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n- **Column 4 (4|64|128|8):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n\n### **DOWN**  \nProcessing each column downward:  \n- **Column 1 (256|2|8|128):** All tiles are distinct; no merges.  \n- **Column 2 (32|64|16|32):** Tiles 32 are in positions 1 and 4, separated by 64 and 16.

However, since the grid is full but the game has not yet ended (epoch 56 < 100), any direction is a valid move. Strategically, keeping larger tiles (e.g., 256) in corners is preferred. Moving LEFT keeps the 256 in row 1, column 1 (a corner) undisturbed, making it a reasonable choice.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to maximize tile merges and score while strategically positioning larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 256 | 32 | 16 | 4\nRow 1: 2 | 64 | 8 | 64\nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 256 | 128\nRow 3: 128 | 32 | 2 | 8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows have distinct tiles (no adjacent duplicates). Tiles are already shifted leftmost, so no merges occur. No score gain.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles are distinct and already shifted rightmost. No merges.  \n   - **Row 1**: Original tiles: `[2, 64, 8, 64]`. When shifting right, the `64` tiles (positions 2 and 4) become adjacent after shifting: `[2, 8, 64, 64]`. These merge into `128`, leaving `[2, 8, 0, 128]`. Score gain: `128`.  \n   - **Rows 2 and 3**: Tiles are distinct. No merges.  \n   - **Key Outcome**: Merges `64 + 64` into `128` in Row 1, gaining 128 points.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - All columns have distinct tiles (no adjacent duplicates). Tiles are already shifted topmost, so no merges occur. No score gain.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - **Column 1**: Original tiles: `[32, 64, 16, 32]`. When shifting down, the `32` tiles (positions 0 and 3) become adjacent after shifting: `[64, 16, 32, 32]`. These merge into `64`, leaving `[64, 16, 0, 64]`. Score gain: `64`.  \n   - Other columns: Tiles are distinct. No merges.  \n   - **Key Outcome**: Merges `32 + 32` into `64` in Column 1, gaining 64 points.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe RIGHT swipe results in the highest score gain (128 points) by merging two `64` tiles in Row 1. This is better than the DOWN swipe (64 points) and the other directions (no merges).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning. The grid is currently full (no empty tiles, 0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value to merge. \n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 256 | 32 | 16 | 4  \nRow 1: 2 | 64 | 8 | 64  \nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 256 | 128  \nRow 3: 128 | 32 | 2 | 8  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No empty tiles**: All 16 tiles are non-zero, so moves rely on merging adjacent equal tiles.\n- **Adjacent tile pairs**: Checking all horizontal and vertical adjacent pairs (e.g., 256-32, 32-16, 16-4 in Row 0; 2-64, 64-8, 8-64 in Row 1; etc.) reveals no pairs of equal values. For example, the two 64s in Row 1 (columns 1 and 3) are separated by an 8, and the two 32s in Column 1 (rows 0 and 3) are separated by 64 and 16. No other adjacent pairs exist.\n\n### Move Evaluation:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: No merges possible in any row, as all tiles are distinct and no empty spaces allow shifting.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: No merges possible in any column, as all tiles are distinct and no empty spaces allow shifting.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, there are no valid moves.

The goal is to identify moves that merge tiles (to gain score) or position tiles strategically for future merges.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 256 | 32 | 16 | 4  \nRow 1: 2 | 64 | 8 | 64  \nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 256 | 128  \nRow 3: 128 | 32 | 2 | 8  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **Left Swipe**:  \n   Each row shifts left. All tiles in every row are distinct (no adjacent equal tiles), so no merges occur. The board remains unchanged, and no score is gained.  \n\n2. **Right Swipe**:  \n   Each row shifts right. All tiles in every row are distinct (no adjacent equal tiles), so no merges occur. The board remains unchanged, and no score is gained.  \n\n3. **Up Swipe**:  \n   Each column shifts up. All tiles in every column are distinct (no adjacent equal tiles), so no merges occur. The board remains unchanged, and no score is gained.  \n\n4. **Down Swipe**:  \n   Each column shifts down. All tiles in every column are distinct (no adjacent equal tiles), so no merges occur.

This means no valid merges are possible in any direction.  \n- By the game rules, a valid move requires either merging adjacent equal tiles or moving tiles into empty spaces. Since both conditions are unmet, all moves are technically invalid. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nTo position tiles for potential future merges, keeping larger tiles (e.g., 256, 128) in corners is advisable. Swiping left maintains the 256 in the top-left corner, a common strategic position for high-value tiles.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning.

For example:  \n   - Row 1 has 64s at (1,1) and (1,3), but they are separated by an 8 (non-adjacent).  \n   - Column 1 has 32s at (0,1) and (3,1), but they are separated by 64 and 16 (non-adjacent).  \n   - All other rows and columns also lack adjacent equal tiles.  \n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: No merges occur in any row because no adjacent equal tiles exist. Tiles remain in their positions since there are no empty spaces to shift into.  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: No merges occur in any column for the same reason—no adjacent equal tiles, and no empty spaces to shift tiles into.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nSince no immediate merges are possible, the goal shifts to positioning tiles for future merges. The largest tile (256) is in the top-left corner (0,0), a strategic corner to preserve. Moving LEFT maintains this corner position, keeping larger tiles concentrated and potentially setting up future merges as new tiles (2\/4) are added.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to identify valid merges and strategic positioning of tiles.

After shifting, they become adjacent in rows 2 and 3, merging into 64 (score +64).  \n- **Columns 2-3**: All tiles are distinct (no merges).  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nBoth UP and DOWN swipes merge the 32s in column 1, yielding 64 points. However, keeping larger tiles in corners is strategic. The largest tiles (256, 128) are in corners (row 0, col 0; row 2, col 2; row 3, col 0). Swiping DOWN moves the merged 64 to row 3, col 1, aligning with the bottom row (where larger tiles like 128 in row 3, col 0 are already positioned).

The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 256 | 32 | 16 | 4  \nRow 1: 2 | 64 | 8 | 64  \nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 256 | 128  \nRow 3: 128 | 32 | 2 | 8  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid State**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same number.\n2. **Merging Opportunities**:  \n   - Row 1 has two `64` tiles (columns 1 and 3, 0-based). These are separated by an `8`, so they are not adjacent horizontally.  \n   - Column 1 has two `32` tiles (rows 0 and 3, 0-based). These are separated by `64` and `16`, so they are not adjacent vertically.  \n   - No other adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same number.  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT**: All rows are full with distinct tiles. No merging occurs, and the board remains unchanged.  \n- **RIGHT**: Row 1 has `2 | 64 | 8 | 64`. When moving right, tiles shift toward the right edge. The `64` in column 1 and `64` in column 3 could potentially align if the `8` between them shifts left, making the `64`s adjacent. This would allow merging into `128`, creating a valid move.  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: Columns are full with distinct tiles. No merging occurs, and the board remains unchanged.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe `64` tiles in Row 1 are the only potential candidates for merging. Swiping RIGHT maximizes the chance of aligning these `64`s (by shifting the `8` left), enabling a merge and creating an empty space for future moves. This aligns with the strategy of combining smaller tiles to build larger ones.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the consequences of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to identify valid moves (merging adjacent tiles or shifting into empty spaces) and prioritize strategic merges to maximize scores.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 256 | 32 | 16 | 4\nRow 1: 2 | 64 | 8 | 64\nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 256 | 128\nRow 3: 128 | 32 | 2 | 8\n```\nAll tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same value. We check for horizontal and vertical adjacents:\n\n- **Row 0**: All tiles (256, 32, 16, 4) are distinct and non-adjacent.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles (2, 64, 8, 64) have 64s separated by 8 (not adjacent).\n- **Row 2**: All tiles (8, 16, 256, 128) are distinct.\n- **Row 3**: All tiles (128, 32, 2, 8) are distinct.\n- **Columns**: All columns also have distinct adjacent tiles (e.g., Column 1: 32, 64, 16, 32—32s are non-adjacent).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: No merges possible in any row, as tiles are distinct and no empty spaces exist to shift into.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: No merges possible in any column, as tiles are distinct and no empty spaces exist to shift into.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent tiles of the same value, meaning there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we arbitrarily choose **DOWN** (as no direction is valid, but the format requires an answer).\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to check for valid merges or tile movements on the given 4x4 grid.

For example:  \n  - Row 1 has two 64s but they are separated by an 8 (not adjacent).  \n  - Column 1 has two 32s (row 0 and row 3) but they are separated by 64 and 16 (not adjacent).  \n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Each row is processed to shift tiles left. No merges occur because no adjacent equal tiles exist. The grid remains unchanged, but this move keeps larger tiles (e.g., 256 in row 0, column 0) in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row is processed to shift tiles right. No merges occur (same reason as LEFT). This move pushes smaller tiles to the right, which may not align with the goal of grouping larger tiles in a corner.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Each column is processed to shift tiles up. No merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles). This move could disrupt the current arrangement of larger tiles (e.g., 256 in row 2, column 2).  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Each column is processed to shift tiles down. No merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles). This move pushes larger tiles (e.g., 128 in row 3, column 0) further down, which may not be optimal for future merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSince no immediate merges are possible, the best move prioritizes maintaining larger tiles in a corner (top-left) to facilitate future merges. Moving LEFT aligns with this strategy.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

The goal is to maximize score by merging tiles and strategically positioning larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 256 | 32 | 16 | 4  \nRow 1: 2 | 64 | 8 | 64  \nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 256 | 128  \nRow 3: 128 | 32 | 2 | 8  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Move**  \nAll rows have no adjacent equal tiles and no empty spaces. Tiles cannot merge or shift left. The board remains unchanged except for a new tile (2 or 4) added, which does not improve the layout.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Move**  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles are [2, 64, 8, 64]. When moving right, the two 64s (positions 1 and 3) shift right and become adjacent, merging into 128. The row becomes [2, 8, 128, 0]. This merge adds 128 to the score and creates an empty space (0) where a new tile will spawn.  \n- Other rows have no adjacent equal tiles, so they remain unchanged.  \n\n#### **UP Move**  \nAll columns have no adjacent equal tiles and no empty spaces. Tiles cannot merge or shift up. The board remains unchanged except for a new tile, which provides no strategic benefit.  \n\n#### **DOWN Move**  \nAll columns have no adjacent equal tiles and no empty spaces. Tiles cannot merge or shift down. The board remains unchanged except for a new tile, which provides no strategic benefit.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only direction with a valid merge (64 + 64 → 128) is **RIGHT**, which increases the score and creates an empty space for future moves. This is the most strategic choice.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges, score gain, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 256 | 32 | 16 | 4\nRow 1: 2 | 64 | 8 | 64\nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 256 | 128\nRow 3: 128 | 32 | 2 | 8\n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are distinct (256, 32, 16, 4) → no merges.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles [2, 64, 8, 64] shift left. The two 64s merge into 128, resulting in [2, 128, 8, 0]. Score gain: 128.\n- **Row 2\/3**: Tiles are distinct → no merges.  \nResult: Row 1 has a 128 in column 1, with an empty tile in column 3. No further strategic merges are set up.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are distinct (256, 32, 16, 4) → no merges.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles [2, 64, 8, 64] shift right. The two 64s merge into 128, resulting in [0, 2, 8, 128]. Score gain: 128.\n- **Row 2\/3**: Tiles are distinct → no merges.  \nResult: Row 1 has a 128 in column 3, adjacent to the 128 in Row 2, column 3 (original board). This sets up a potential merge of two 128s into 256 in a subsequent UP move, which is strategically valuable.\n\n### UP\/DOWN Moves:\n- **UP**: All columns have distinct tiles (e.g., Column 0: 256, 2, 8, 128; Column 1: 32, 64, 16, 32; etc.) → no merges.  \n- **DOWN**: Similarly, all columns have distinct tiles → no merges.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe RIGHT move merges the 64s in Row 1, column 3, aligning a 128 with the existing 128 in Row 2, column 3. This positions the board for a future UP move to merge these 128s into 256, a high-value merge. In contrast, the LEFT move does not set up such a strategic opportunity.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and tile movement. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 256 | 32 | 16 | 4\nRow 1: 2 | 64 | 8 | 64\nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 256 | 128\nRow 3: 128 | 32 | 2 | 8\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The grid is **completely full** (no zeros), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same number.\n- No adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value, meaning no merges are possible in any direction.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**: All rows are processed left-to-right. Since no adjacent tiles in any row are the same, no merges occur. Tiles remain in their current positions.  \n2. **RIGHT**: All rows are processed right-to-left. Similarly, no adjacent tiles in any row are the same, so no merges occur. Tiles remain in their current positions.  \n3. **UP**: All columns are processed top-to-bottom. No adjacent tiles in any column are the same, so no merges occur. Tiles remain in their current positions.  \n4. **DOWN**: All columns are processed bottom-to-top. No adjacent tiles in any column are the same, so no merges occur. Tiles remain in their current positions.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, **no valid moves exist** to create new merges or shift tiles. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid merges, any direction is technically acceptable, but we choose **LEFT** as a default.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement.

Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend on adjacent same-value tiles.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Each row is processed leftward. No adjacent same-value tiles exist in any row. For example, row 1 (`2|64|8|64`) has 64s separated by 8, so no merge. All rows remain unchanged. No score gain, but tiles stay left-aligned, which is strategic for future merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Each row is processed rightward. Similarly, no adjacent same-value tiles exist in any row. For example, row 1 (`2|64|8|64`) has 64s separated by 8, so no merge. All rows remain unchanged. No score gain, and tiles shift right, which may scatter larger tiles.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Each column is processed upward. No adjacent same-value tiles exist in any column. For example, column 1 (`32|64|16|32`) has 32s separated by 64 and 16, so no merge. All columns remain unchanged. No score gain, and vertical alignment offers no immediate advantage.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Each column is processed downward. No adjacent same-value tiles exist in any column. For example, column 1 (`32|64|16|32`) has 32s separated by 64 and 16, so no merge. All columns remain unchanged. No score gain, and vertical alignment may disrupt tile grouping.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nSince no merges are possible in any direction, the choice focuses on maintaining a strategic tile arrangement. Left-aligned tiles (LEFT move) keep larger tiles (e.g., 256 in row 0) consolidated in the top-left corner, which is a common 2048 strategy to facilitate future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merges and movement potential.

However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and the game has not yet reached epoch 100, the only plausible choice (despite no immediate merges) is **RIGHT** (a common strategy to consolidate tiles).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement. The current game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 256|32|16|4  \nRow 1: 2|64|8|64  \nRow 2: 8|16|256|128  \nRow 3: 128|32|2|8  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Grid State**: All tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces), so the grid is full.  \n- **Adjacent Tiles**: No horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles have the same value. For example:  \n  - Row 1 has 64s in columns 1 and 3, but they are separated by an 8 (not adjacent).  \n  - Column 1 has 32s in rows 0 and 3, but they are separated by 64 and 16 (not adjacent).  \n- **Valid Moves**: A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, all swipes will not result in merges or tile movement. However, the game continues until the 100th epoch, so a direction must still be chosen.  \n\n\n### Evaluation of Directions:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Swiping left or right will not shift any tiles (grid is full, no merges).  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: Swiping up or down will also not shift any tiles (grid is full, no merges).  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nSince no merges are possible, the choice prioritizes maintaining larger tiles in corners. The largest tiles (256, 128) are already in corners (e.g., 256 at (0,0), 128 at (3,0)). Swiping LEFT minimally disturbs the current arrangement, keeping larger tiles in place.  \n\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for possible merges and strategic tile placement. The game board is:\n\nRow 0: 256 | 32 | 16 | 4  \nRow 1: 2 | 64 | 8 | 64  \nRow 2: 8 | 16 | 256 | 128  \nRow 3: 128 | 32 | 2 | 8  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles are distinct (256, 32, 16, 4). No merges.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles are 2, 64, 8, 64. When shifted left, the two 64s (positions 1 and 3) become adjacent, merging into 128. The row becomes [2, 128, 8, 0], adding 128 to the score.  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles are distinct (8, 16, 256, 128). No merges.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles are distinct (128, 32, 2, 8). No merges.  \n   **Result**: Merges occur in Row 1, yielding 128 points.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - All rows have distinct tiles with no adjacent duplicates. Shifting right does not trigger any merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges, 0 points.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are analyzed for vertical merges. All columns have distinct tiles (e.g., Column 0: 256, 2, 8, 128; Column 1: 32, 64, 16, 32). No adjacent duplicates to merge.  \n   **Result**: No merges, 0 points.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are analyzed for vertical merges. All columns have distinct tiles (e.g., Column 0: 256, 2, 8, 128; Column 1: 32, 64, 16, 32). No adjacent duplicates to merge.  \n   **Result**: No merges, 0 points.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only move that triggers a merge (and thus increases the score) is **LEFT**, where two 64s in Row 1 merge into 128. This move also keeps larger tiles (e.g., 256 in Row 0, Column 0) in a corner, aligning with strategic goals.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. The key is to check for possible merges or tile movements into empty spaces, as valid moves require either merging adjacent equal tiles or moving tiles into empty spaces.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 256|32|16|4  \nRow 1: 2|64|8|64  \nRow 2: 8|16|256|128  \nRow 3: 128|32|2|8  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles are 256, 32, 16, 4 (all distinct).

No merges possible. **Invalid**.\n\n### DOWN Move:\nCheck columns for merges:\n- **Column 1** (values: 32, 64, 16, 32, top to bottom):  \n  When moving down, the 32 (row 0) shifts past 64 (row 1) and 16 (row 2) to row 2, adjacent to the 32 (row 3). These two 32s merge into 64, creating a valid merge.  \n\nNo other columns have merges, but the merge in column 1 makes DOWN a valid move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merges and valid moves.

For example:\n   - Row 1 has two 64s, but they are separated by an 8 (not adjacent).\n   - Column 1 has two 32s, but they are in rows 0 and 3 (separated by rows 1 and 2, not adjacent).\n   - All other tiles are unique in their adjacent positions.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipe**: Since all rows are full and no adjacent tiles in any row are the same, swiping left or right will not merge any tiles. Tiles cannot shift further left\/right (already at the edges), so no valid movement.\n- **UP\/DOWN Swipe**: Similarly, all columns are full, and no adjacent tiles in any column are the same. Swiping up or down will not merge tiles, and tiles cannot shift further up\/down (already at the edges), so no valid movement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent tiles of the same value, meaning there are no valid moves.

Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n256|32|16|4\n2|64|8|64\n8|16|256|128\n128|32|2|8\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

However, since the 2s are already in the rightmost column (column 3), swiping right leaves them unchanged. Swiping left moves them to the leftmost column (column 0), but no merging occurs. These moves do not increase the score and fail to combine tiles, making them suboptimal.\n\n2. **UP\/DOWN**: Swiping up or down affects the column containing the 2s (column 3).  \n   - **UP**: The 2s in row 1 and row 2 of column 3 move upward. They stack in row 0 and row 1, then merge into a 4 (since they are adjacent and equal). This merges the 2s, increasing the score by 4.  \n   - **DOWN**: The 2s in row 1 and row 2 of column 3 move downward. They stack in row 2 and row 3, then merge into a 4 (adjacent and equal).

Merging the 2s into a 4 in a corner (either top-right or bottom-right) aligns with this strategy. Between UP and DOWN, merging into the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3) is preferable, as it positions the new 4 in a corner, leaving more flexibility for future merges as new tiles (2 or 4) spawn in empty spaces.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the potential outcomes of each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 2|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|4\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The largest tile is 4, located at (3, 3) (bottom-right corner).\n- The only other tile is 2, located at (2, 0) (middle-left of row 2).\n- No immediate merges are possible, as the 2 and 4 are not adjacent.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Swiping left moves all tiles to the left. The 2 in (2, 0) stays (already leftmost), and the 4 in (3, 3) moves to (3, 0). This moves the largest tile (4) from the bottom-right corner to the bottom-left corner, disrupting the corner strategy. No merges occur.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Swiping right moves all tiles to the right. The 2 in (2, 0) moves to (2, 3) (rightmost of row 2), and the 4 in (3, 3) stays (already rightmost). This positions the 2 in (2, 3), vertically adjacent to the 4 in (3, 3) (same column). This setup allows potential future merges if a new 2 is added in row 1, 3 (e.g., a 2 in row 1, 3 and the 2 in row 2, 3 could merge with a DOWN swipe, creating a 4 that could then merge with the 4 in row 3, 3). The 4 remains in the bottom-right corner, preserving the corner strategy.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Swiping up moves all tiles upward. The 2 in (2, 0) moves to (0, 0), and the 4 in (3, 3) moves to (0, 3). This moves the 4 to the top-right corner but scatters the 2 and 4 across the top row, reducing their adjacency and making future merges less likely.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Swiping down moves all tiles downward. The 2 in (2, 0) moves to (3, 0), and the 4 in (3, 3) stays (already bottommost). This positions the 2 in (3, 0), far from the 4 in (3, 3) (same row but separated by empty tiles). No merges are enabled, and the 2 is not positioned to support future merges with the 4.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping RIGHT keeps the largest tile (4) in the bottom-right corner and positions the 2 in a column adjacent to the 4, creating opportunities for future merges. This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners and setting up for strategic merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, and down on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to position tiles for future merges while keeping larger tiles in a corner (a common strategy in 2048).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|2|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|2\nRow 3: 0|0|0|4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left in each row.  \n   - Row 0: `0|2|0|0` → `2|0|0|0` (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: `0|0|0|2` → `2|0|0|0` (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: `0|0|0|4` → `4|0|0|0` (no merge).  \n   Result: Tiles cluster in the left column, but no merges occur. The 4 (largest tile) moves to the bottom-left corner, which is less ideal than keeping it in the bottom-right.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right in each row.  \n   - Row 0: `0|2|0|0` → `0|0|0|2` (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: `0|0|0|2` → `0|0|0|2` (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: `0|0|0|4` → `0|0|0|4` (no merge).  \n   Result: Tiles cluster in the right column. The 4 (largest tile) remains in the bottom-right corner (desirable). The 2 in Row 0, Column 3 and the 2 in Row 2, Column 3 are now aligned vertically in Column 3, setting up for a potential merge in the next move (e.g., swiping up would merge these 2s into a 4).\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up in each column.  \n   - Column 1: `2` (Row 0) → remains in Row 0 (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: `2` (Row 2) and `4` (Row 3) → shift up to Row 0 and Row 1 (no merge).  \n   Result: Tiles spread across the top rows, but no merges occur. The 4 moves to Row 1, Column 3, losing its position in the bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down in each column.  \n   - Column 1: `2` (Row 0) → shifts to Row 3 (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: `2` (Row 2) and `4` (Row 3) → remain in place (no merge).  \n   Result: Tiles cluster in the bottom rows, but no merges occur. The 4 stays in the bottom-right, but the 2 from Row 0, Column 1 moves to Row 3, Column 1, which does not set up for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping **RIGHT** keeps the largest tile (4) in the bottom-right corner (a strategic position) and aligns two 2s vertically in Column 3. This setup allows for a potential merge of these 2s into a 4 in the next move (e.g., swiping up), maximizing future scoring opportunities.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 2|0|0|2  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: [0,0,0,2] → shifts left to [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- Row 1: [0,0,0,0] → unchanged.  \n- Row 2: [2,0,0,2] → shifts left to [2,2,0,0], then merges to [4,0,0,0] (score +4).  \n- Row 3: [0,0,0,4] → shifts left to [4,0,0,0] (no merge).  \nResult: 2, 0, 0, 0 in Row 0; 0, 0, 0, 0 in Row 1; 4, 0, 0, 0 in Row 2; 4, 0, 0, 0 in Row 3.  \nLarger tiles (4s) are spread in Column 0, reducing corner consolidation.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: [0,0,0,2] → unchanged (already rightmost).  \n- Row 1: [0,0,0,0] → unchanged.  \n- Row 2: [2,0,0,2] → shifts right to [0,0,2,2], then merges to [0,0,0,4] (score +4).  \n- Row 3: [0,0,0,4] → unchanged (already rightmost).  \nResult: 0,0,0,2 in Row 0; 0,0,0,0 in Row 1; 0,0,0,4 in Row 2; 0,0,0,4 in Row 3.  \nLarger tiles (4s) are in Row 2 and 3, Column 4 (bottom-right corner), but the 2 in Row 0, Column 4 blocks potential merging.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Column 0: [0,0,2,0] → shifts up to [2,0,0,0].  \n- Column 3: [2,0,2,4] → shifts up to [2,2,4,0], then merges 2s to [4,4,0,0] (score +4).  \nResult: 2,0,0,4 in Row 0; 0,0,0,4 in Row 1; 0,0,0,0 in Row 2; 0,0,0,0 in Row 3.  \nLarger tiles (4s) are in Row 0 and 1, Column 4, moving them away from the bottom-right corner.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Column 0: [0,0,2,0] → shifts down to [0,0,0,2].  \n- Column 3: [2,0,2,4] → shifts down to [0,2,2,4], then merges 2s to [0,0,4,4] (score +4).  \nResult: 0,0,0,0 in Row 0; 0,0,0,0 in Row 1; 0,0,0,4 in Row 2; 0,0,0,4 in Row 3.  \nLarger tiles (4s) are stacked vertically in the bottom-right corner (Row 2 and 3, Column 4), ideal for future merging (e.g., next DOWN move could merge them into 8).  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nMoving **DOWN** consolidates the largest tiles (4s) in the bottom-right corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given 4x4 grid.

The goal is to maximize score and strategically position larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|4|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 3: 0|4|4|8  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 1: `0|0|4|0` shifts left to `4|0|0|0` (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: `0|0|0|8` shifts left to `8|0|0|0` (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: `0|4|4|8` shifts left, merges `4` and `4` into `8`, resulting in `8|8|0|0` (score +8).  \n   - Outcome: Tiles are scattered, with no large merges. Not optimal.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 1: `0|0|4|0` shifts right to `0|0|0|4` (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: `0|0|0|8` remains `0|0|0|8` (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: `0|4|4|8` shifts right, merges `4` and `4` into `8`, then merges `8` and `8` into `16` (score +8 +16=24). Result: `0|0|0|16`.  \n   - Outcome: 16 in the bottom-right corner, but other rows are less organized.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: All zeros, no change.  \n   - Column 1: `[0,0,0,4]` shifts up to `[4,0,0,0]` (no merge).  \n   - Column 2: `[0,4,0,4]` shifts up, merges `4` and `4` into `8` (score +8). Result: `[8,0,0,0]`.  \n   - Column 3: `[0,0,8,8]` shifts up, merges `8` and `8` into `16` (score +16). Result: `[16,0,0,0]`.  \n   - Outcome: Row 0 becomes `0|4|8|16`, with all other rows empty. The 16 is in the top-right corner, and smaller tiles (4, 8) are aligned to the left, creating a strategic sequence for future merges.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: All zeros, no change.  \n   - Column 1: `[0,0,0,4]` remains `[0,0,0,4]` (no merge).  \n   - Column 2: `[0,4,0,4]` shifts down, merges `4` and `4` into `8` (score +8). Result: `[0,0,0,8]`.  \n   - Column 3: `[0,0,8,8]` shifts down, merges `8` and `8` into `16` (score +16). Result: `[0,0,0,16]`.  \n   - Outcome: Row 3 becomes `0|4|8|16`, with all other rows empty. The 16 is in the bottom-right corner, but the sequence is less accessible for future merges compared to the UP swipe.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe results in the largest tile (16) in the top-right corner, with smaller tiles (4, 8) aligned to the left. This configuration maximizes future merge potential (e.g., a new 4 in row 0, column 0 could merge left with the existing 4, creating an 8, and so on). \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, positioning large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|4|8|16\nRow 1: 0|0|4|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **UP**: Tiles move upward. All non-zero tiles are already in the top rows (row 0 and row 1) with no empty spaces above them. Swiping UP results in no movement or merges. **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles move right. Row 0 (0|4|8|16) remains unchanged (16 is already rightmost). Row 1 (0|0|4|0) shifts 4 to the rightmost column, becoming 0|0|0|4. No merges occur. While valid (tiles move), it does not position tiles for future merges effectively.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Tiles move left. Row 0 (0|4|8|16) shifts to 4|8|16|0 (no merges). Row 1 (0|0|4|0) shifts to 4|0|0|0 (no merges). The 16 remains in row 0, column 2 (not a corner), and no immediate merges are set up.\n\n4. **DOWN**: Tiles move downward. Let’s process each column:\n   - Column 0: All zeros (no change).\n   - Column 1: 4 (row 0) moves down to row 3 → column 1 becomes 0|0|0|4.\n   - Column 2: 8 (row 0) and 4 (row 1) move down to row 2 and row 3 → column 2 becomes 0|0|8|4.\n   - Column 3: 16 (row 0) moves down to row 3 (bottom-right corner) → column 3 becomes 0|0|0|16.\n\n   After moving down, the board becomes:\n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0\n   Row 1: 0|0|0|0\n   Row 2: 0|0|8|0\n   Row 3: 0|4|4|16\n   ```\n   - The 16 is now in the bottom-right corner (ideal for large tile positioning).\n   - Row 3 has adjacent 4s (columns 1 and 2), which can merge with a subsequent LEFT swipe, setting up future points.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move. It positions the largest tile (16) in the bottom-right corner and sets up adjacent 4s in row 3 for a potential merge in the next move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to merge tiles strategically, maximize score, and position larger tiles (especially the 16) in a corner for future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 4 | 0 | 0\nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 8 | 0\nRow 3: 0 | 4 | 4 | 16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [0, 4, 0, 0] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 0] (no change).  \n   - Row 2: [0, 0, 8, 0] → [8, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: [0, 4, 4, 16] → [8, 16, 0, 0] (merges 4 and 4 into 8, +8 score).  \n   - Result: 16 moves to row 3, column 2 (not a corner).  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [0, 4, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 0] (no change).  \n   - Row 2: [0, 0, 8, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 8] (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: [0, 4, 4, 16] → [0, 0, 8, 16] (merges 4 and 4 into 8, +8 score).  \n   - Result: 16 remains in row 3, column 3 (corner), which is optimal for future merges.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: All zeros (no change).  \n   - Column 1: [4, 0, 0, 4] → [8, 0, 0, 0] (merges 4 and 4 into 8, +8 score).  \n   - Column 2: [0, 0, 8, 4] → [8, 4, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: [0, 0, 0, 16] → [16, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Result: 16 moves to row 0, column 3 (corner), but 8s in row 0 (columns 1 and 2) are adjacent horizontally, which could merge in a future left swipe.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: All zeros (no change).  \n   - Column 1: [4, 0, 0, 4] → [0, 0, 0, 8] (merges 4 and 4 into 8, +8 score).  \n   - Column 2: [0, 0, 8, 4] → [0, 0, 8, 4] (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: [0, 0, 0, 16] → [0, 0, 0, 16] (no merge).  \n   - Result: 16 remains in row 3, column 3 (corner), but 8 and 4 in row 3 (columns 1 and 2) are less strategically positioned.  \n\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nThe **RIGHT** swipe keeps the 16 in the bottom-right corner (optimal for future merges) and positions the merged 8 in row 3, column 2, which can potentially merge with other 8s in subsequent moves. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners and setting up for future combinations.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to align tiles strategically, particularly keeping larger tiles in a corner (here, the 16 in the bottom-right corner) to facilitate future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|4|0|8  \nRow 3: 0|0|8|16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left. Row 0: `0|0|0|4` → `4|0|0|0`. Row 2: `0|4|0|8` → `4|8|0|0`. Row 3: `0|0|8|16` → `8|16|0|0`.  \n   - No merges occur. The 16 in (3,3) moves to (3,1), losing its corner position. **Not ideal**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right. Row 0: `0|0|0|4` (no change). Row 2: `0|4|0|8` → `0|0|4|8`. Row 3: `0|0|8|16` (no change).  \n   - No merges occur. The 16 stays in (3,3), but 8s in (2,3) and (3,2) are diagonal, not adjacent for future merges. **Less strategic**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift up. Column 1: `0|0|4|0` → `4|0|0|0`. Column 2: `0|0|0|8` → `8|0|0|0`. Column 3: `4|0|8|16` → `4|8|16|0`.  \n   - No merges occur. The 16 moves from (3,3) to (2,3), leaving its corner. **Not ideal**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down. Column 1: `0|0|4|0` → `0|0|0|4` (4 moves to row 3). Column 3: `4|0|8|16` → `0|4|8|16` (4 moves to row 1, 8 stays in row 2, 16 remains in row 3).  \n   - No merges occur, but the 16 stays in the bottom-right corner (3,3). Row 3 becomes `0|4|8|16`, aligning 4, 8, and 16 in sequence. This setup facilitates future merges (e.g., a new 4 in row 3, column 0 could merge with the existing 4 in (3,1), then 8s, etc.). **Best for strategic alignment**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping **DOWN** keeps the largest tile (16) in the corner and aligns smaller tiles in a sequence, optimizing for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and simulate each possible swipe (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to evaluate merges, tile alignment, and strategic positioning of larger tiles. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|2|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 3: 0|4|8|16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. The 16 in row 3, column 3 (bottom-right corner) moves to column 2, losing its corner position. This weakens the strategic alignment of large tiles.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right. The 16 remains in the bottom-right corner, and the right column (column 3) becomes [2, 4, 8, 16] (from top to bottom). While this preserves the corner, no merges occur immediately, and future merges depend on new tile spawns.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift upward. Let’s simulate column-wise:  \n     - Column 1 (originally [0, 0, 0, 4]) shifts to [4, 0, 0, 0].  \n     - Column 2 (originally [2, 0, 0, 8]) shifts to [2, 8, 0, 0].  \n     - Column 3 (originally [0, 4, 8, 16]) shifts to [4, 8, 16, 0].  \n   - After shifting, the board becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|4|2|4  \n     Row 1: 0|0|8|8  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|16  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - Notably, row 1 now has adjacent 8s (columns 2 and 3). While these do not merge during the UP swipe (merging only occurs in the direction of the move, i.e., vertically), this setup allows a future LEFT swipe to merge the 8s into 16, generating score. The 16 remains in the bottom-right corner (row 2, column 3), maintaining strategic positioning.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift downward, but no meaningful movement or merges occur. The board remains nearly unchanged, making this move ineffective.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe UP swipe is optimal. It positions the 16 in a corner, creates adjacent 8s in row 1 (enabling a future merge for score), and maintains strategic alignment for subsequent moves.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes:\n\n### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: `0|4|2|4` shifts left to `4|2|4|0` (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: `0|0|8|8` shifts left, merging the two 8s into 16. Result: `16|0|0|0` (score +16).  \n- **Row 2**: `0|0|0|16` shifts left to `16|0|0|0` (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: `0|0|0|2` shifts left to `2|0|0|0` (no merges).  \nAfter LEFT, the 16s from Row 1 and Row 2 are in the left column (Column 0), which may not align for future merges.  \n\n\n### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: `0|4|2|4` shifts right (no merges, remains `0|4|2|4`).  \n- **Row 1**: `0|0|8|8` shifts right, merging the two 8s into 16. Result: `0|0|0|16` (score +16).  \n- **Row 2**: `0|0|0|16` shifts right (no merges, remains `0|0|0|16`).  \n- **Row 3**: `0|0|0|2` shifts right (no merges, remains `0|0|0|2`).  \nAfter RIGHT, the 16 from Row 1 (Column 3) and the existing 16 in Row 2 (Column 3) are vertically adjacent in the rightmost column. This positions them for a potential future merge (e.g., swiping UP to combine into 32), which is strategic for higher scores.  \n\n\n### **UP Swipe**  \n- All columns have no adjacent equal tiles, and tiles are already shifted up. No movement or merges occur. **Invalid move**.  \n\n\n### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- Columns shift tiles down, but no merges occur (all tiles in columns are distinct). Tiles move but do not merge, resulting in no score gain. This is less optimal than LEFT\/RIGHT.  \n\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nRIGHT is the best move. It merges the 8s in Row 1 into 16 (scoring +16) and positions the 16s vertically in the rightmost column, setting up for future merges (e.g., 16 + 16 = 32). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (right column) for better long-term merging potential.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. The goal is to maximize score through merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|4|2|4  \nRow 1: 0|0|4|16  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|2  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT**:  \n- Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n- Result: No score gain. Not optimal.\n\n#### **RIGHT**:  \n- Tiles are already as far right as possible, with no merges or movement.  \n- Result: Invalid move (no valid merges or shifts).  \n\n#### **UP**:  \n- Columns are processed top-to-bottom.  \n  - **Column 3**: [4, 16, 16, 2] → 16 and 16 merge into 32 (score +32).  \n- Result: Score gain of 32. The 32 is placed in row 1, column 3.  \n\n#### **DOWN**:  \n- Columns are processed bottom-to-top.  \n  - **Column 3**: [4, 16, 16, 2] → 16 and 16 merge into 32 (score +32).  \n  - **Row 3**: After shifting, [0, 4, 2, 2] → 2 and 2 merge into 4 (score +4).  \n- Result: Total score gain of 36. The 32 is placed in row 2, column 3, and the 4 (from merged 2s) is in row 3, column 3.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nDOWN yields the highest score (36) due to two merges (16+16=32 and 2+2=4). It also positions the 32 in a corner (row 2, column 3), aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

Result: [4,32,2,0].  \n\nTotal score from merges: 0.  \n\n\n### **DOWN Swipe Analysis**  \nColumns are shifted down, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles after shifting):  \n- **Column 0**: [0,16,0,0] → Shift down, 16 moves to Row 3. Result: [0,0,0,16].  \n- **Column 1**: [2,16,0,0] → Shift down, 2 moves to Row 2, 16 to Row 3. Result: [0,0,2,16].  \n- **Column 2**: [2,8,0,0] → Shift down, 2 moves to Row 2, 8 to Row 3. Result: [0,0,2,8].  \n- **Column 3**: [4,32,2,0] → Shift down, 4 moves to Row 1, 2 to Row 2, 32 to Row 3. Result: [0,4,2,32].  \n\nTotal score from merges: 0.  \n\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 36 points, but RIGHT better aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (right side). The 32s in Row 1 after a RIGHT swipe are positioned on the right, which is more strategic for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges and set up future opportunities.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|4|4\nRow 1: 0|32|8|32\nRow 2: 0|0|0|2\nRow 3: 0|0|2|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `[0,0,4,4]` shift left. The two `4`s merge into `8`, resulting in `[8,0,0,0]`. Score +8.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `[0,32,8,32]` shift left to `[32,8,32,0]` (no merges, as `32`s are separated by `8`).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles `[0,0,0,2]` shift left to `[2,0,0,0]` (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles `[0,0,2,0]` shift left to `[2,0,0,0]` (no merges).\n\n**Resulting Board (LEFT)**:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|0|0\nRow 1: 32|8|32|0\nRow 2: 2|0|0|0\nRow 3: 2|0|0|0\n```\n- New tile (2 or 4) added to a random empty cell. The `2`s in Row 2 and 3 (Column 0) can merge with a subsequent UP swipe.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `[0,0,4,4]` shift right. The two `4`s merge into `8`, resulting in `[0,0,0,8]`. Score +8.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `[0,32,8,32]` shift right to `[0,32,8,32]` (no merges, as `32`s are separated by `8`).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles `[0,0,0,2]` shift right to `[0,0,0,2]` (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles `[0,0,2,0]` shift right to `[0,0,0,2]` (no merges).\n\n**Resulting Board (RIGHT)**:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|8\nRow 1: 0|32|8|32\nRow 2: 0|0|0|2\nRow 3: 0|0|0|2\n```\n- New tile (2 or 4) added to a random empty cell. The `2`s in Row 2 and 3 (Column 3) can merge with a subsequent DOWN swipe.\n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed, but no merges occur. Tiles shift upward but do not combine (e.g., `4,8,0,2` in Column 2 and `4,32,2,0` in Column 3 remain unmerged). No score gain.\n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed, but no merges occur. Tiles shift downward but do not combine (e.g., `0,32,0,0` in Column 1 and `4,8,0,2` in Column 2 remain unmerged). No score gain.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the `4`s in Row 0 for +8 score. However, LEFT positions the merged `8` in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for larger tiles) and aligns `2`s in Column 0 (enabling a future UP swipe to merge them). This setup is marginally better for long-term tile organization.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic positioning of tiles. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|0|0\nRow 1: 32|8|32|0\nRow 2: 2|0|0|4\nRow 3: 2|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- Row 0: 8 remains in column 0 (no change).  \n- Row 1: 32, 8, 32, 0 → Tiles shift left but no merges (32s are separated by 8).  \n- Row 2: 2, 0, 0, 4 → Shifts to 2|4|0|0 (no merge).  \n- Row 3: 2 shifts to column 0 (no change).  \n**Result:** No merges. Unproductive.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- Row 0: 8 shifts to column 3.  \n- Row 1: 32, 8, 32, 0 → Shifts to 0|32|8|32 (no merges, 32s separated by 8).  \n- Row 2: 2, 0, 0, 4 → Shifts to 0|0|2|4 (no merge).  \n- Row 3: 2 shifts to column 3.  \n**Result:** No merges. Unproductive.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- **Column 0** (tiles: 8, 32, 2, 2):  \n  - 2 (row 2) and 2 (row 3) merge into 4 (row 2).  \n  - Tiles shift up: 8 (row 0), 32 (row 1), 4 (row 2), 0 (row 3).  \n- **Column 1** (tiles: 0, 8, 0, 0):  \n  - 8 (row 1) shifts up to row 0.  \n- **Column 2** (tiles: 0, 32, 0, 0):  \n  - 32 (row 1) shifts up to row 0.  \n- **Column 3** (tiles: 0, 0, 4, 0):  \n  - 4 (row 2) shifts up to row 0.  \n\nResulting board:  \n```\nRow 0: 8|8|32|4  \nRow 1: 32|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n```  \n**Merge:** Two 2s in column 0 merge into 4 (score +4). Additionally, row 0 now has adjacent 8s (columns 0 and 1), which can merge on a subsequent LEFT swipe, creating strategic value.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- **Column 0** (tiles: 8, 32, 2, 2):  \n  - 2 (row 2) and 2 (row 3) merge into 4 (row 3).  \n  - Tiles shift down: 0 (row 0), 8 (row 1), 32 (row 2), 4 (row 3).  \n- **Column 1** (tiles: 0, 8, 0, 0):  \n  - 8 (row 1) shifts down to row 3.  \n- **Column 2** (tiles: 0, 32, 0, 0):  \n  - 32 (row 1) shifts down to row 3.  \n- **Column 3** (tiles: 0, 0, 4, 0):  \n  - 4 (row 2) shifts down to row 3.  \n\nResulting board:  \n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 32|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 4|8|32|4  \n```  \n**Merge:** Two 2s in column 0 merge into 4 (score +4). However, no adjacent large tiles are positioned for future merges, reducing strategic value.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP is the best move. It merges the 2s (gaining 4 points) and positions adjacent 8s in row 0, setting up a potential 16 merge on the next LEFT swipe. This aligns with the strategy of grouping large tiles and creating merge opportunities.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges, score, and position larger tiles strategically (preferably in a corner).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|8|32|4\nRow 1: 32|0|0|0\nRow 2: 4|0|0|8\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \nWhen swiping left, tiles in each row shift left, merging adjacent equal tiles:  \n- **Row 0**: `8|8|32|4` → The two `8`s merge into `16` (score +16), resulting in `16|32|4|0`.  \n- **Row 1**: `32|0|0|0` → Shifts left to `32|0|0|0` (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: `4|0|0|8` → Shifts left to `4|8|0|0` (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: All zeros (no change).  \n\nResulting board after LEFT:  \n```\n16|32|4|0  \n32|0|0|0  \n4|8|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n```  \nThis move merges two `8`s into `16`, scores 16, and consolidates larger tiles (16, 32) in the top-left corner, a strategic position.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nWhen swiping right, tiles in each row shift right, merging adjacent equal tiles:  \n- **Row 0**: `8|8|32|4` → The two `8`s merge into `16` (score +16), resulting in `0|32|4|16`.  \n- **Row 1**: `32|0|0|0` → Shifts right to `0|0|0|32` (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: `4|0|0|8` → Shifts right to `0|0|4|8` (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: All zeros (no change).  \n\nResulting board after RIGHT:  \n```\n0|32|4|16  \n0|0|0|32  \n0|0|4|8  \n0|0|0|0  \n```  \nThis move also merges two `8`s into `16` and scores 16, but larger tiles (16, 32) are scattered, less strategically positioned.\n\n#### **UP**  \nWhen swiping up, tiles in each column shift up, merging adjacent equal tiles:  \n- **Column 0**: `8|32|4|0` → No merges (all values differ).  \n- **Column 1**: `8|0|0|0` → No merges (only `8`).  \n- **Column 2**: `32|0|0|0` → No merges (only `32`).  \n- **Column 3**: `4|0|8|0` → No merges (4 and 8 differ).  \n\nResulting board after UP:  \nNo merges occur, and tiles remain mostly unchanged. This move does not improve the board.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \nWhen swiping down, tiles in each column shift down, merging adjacent equal tiles:  \n- **Column 0**: `8|32|4|0` → No merges (all values differ).  \n- **Column 1**: `8|0|0|0` → No merges (only `8`).  \n- **Column 2**: `32|0|0|0` → No merges (only `32`).  \n- **Column 3**: `4|0|8|0` → No merges (4 and 8 differ).  \n\nResulting board after DOWN:  \nNo merges occur, and tiles shift down but do not consolidate meaningfully.\n\n### Conclusion  \nLEFT and RIGHT both merge two `8`s into `16` (scoring 16). However, LEFT consolidates larger tiles (16, 32) in the top-left corner, a strategic position for future merges. RIGHT scatters larger tiles, making future merges harder. UP and DOWN do not provide meaningful merges or strategic positioning.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to identify a move that either merges tiles for immediate score or sets up future merges while keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 16 | 32 | 4 | 0  \nRow 1: 32 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 4 | 8 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 4 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles merge (e.g., row 0: [16, 32, 4, 0] remains; row 3: [0, 4, 0, 0] becomes [4, 0, 0, 0]).  \n   - No immediate score gain. Larger tiles (16, 32) stay in the left, but no clear setup for future merges.  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles merge (e.g., row 0: [16, 32, 4, 0] becomes [0, 16, 32, 4]; row 1: [32, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 0, 32]).  \n   - No immediate score gain. Larger tiles move right, which is suboptimal (prefer cornering larger tiles).  \n\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift up. Columns are processed top to bottom:  \n     - Column 0: [16, 32, 4, 0] → [16, 32, 4, 0] (no merges).  \n     - Column 1: [32, 0, 8, 4] → [32, 8, 4, 0] (no merges).  \n     - Column 2: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n     - Column 3: All zeros (no change).  \n   - After shifting, row 2 becomes [4, 4, 0, 0] (two 4s adjacent in the same row). This sets up a future LEFT swipe to merge these 4s into an 8 (score gain).  \n   - Larger tiles (16, 32) remain in the top-left corner, aligning with strategic advice.  \n\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift down. Columns are processed bottom to top:  \n     - Column 0: [16, 32, 4, 0] → [0, 16, 32, 4] (no merges).  \n     - Column 1: [32, 0, 8, 4] → [0, 32, 8, 4] (no merges).  \n     - Column 2: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merges).  \n     - Column 3: All zeros (no change).  \n   - No immediate score gain, and larger tiles shift down, which is less optimal than keeping them in the top-left.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move. It keeps larger tiles (16, 32) in the top-left corner and sets up row 2 with two adjacent 4s, enabling a future LEFT swipe to merge them for score. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 32 | 4 | 0\nRow 1: 32 | 8 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 4 | 4 | 2 | 0\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `[16, 32, 4, 0]` shift left with no merges (all distinct). Result: `[16, 32, 4, 0]`.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `[32, 8, 0, 0]` shift left with no merges. Result: `[32, 8, 0, 0]`.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles `[4, 4, 2, 0]` shift left. The two `4`s merge into `8`, and `2` shifts left. Result: `[8, 2, 0, 0]` (score +8).\n- **Row 3**: No change.\n\n**Outcome**: Merges 4+4 into 8 (score +8). Larger tiles (16, 32) remain spread across the left\/middle columns with limited future merge potential.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `[16, 32, 4, 0]` shift right. Result: `[0, 16, 32, 4]` (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `[32, 8, 0, 0]` shift right. Result: `[0, 0, 32, 8]` (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles `[4, 4, 2, 0]` shift right. The two `4`s merge into `8`, and `2` shifts right. Result: `[0, 0, 2, 8]` (score +8).\n- **Row 3**: No change.\n\n**Outcome**: Merges 4+4 into 8 (score +8). Larger tiles (32 in Row 0, Column 2 and Row 1, Column 2) are vertically adjacent, creating future merge potential (e.g., a subsequent UP swipe could merge these 32s into 64).\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed vertically. No adjacent tiles merge (all distinct). Tiles shift up but remain in non-mergeable positions. No score gained.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed vertically. Tiles shift down but no merges occur (all distinct). No score gained.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge 4+4 into 8 (score +8). However, RIGHT positions two 32s vertically adjacent in Column 2 (Row 0 and Row 1), creating a strategic advantage for future merges (e.g., UP swipe to merge 32+32 into 64). This aligns with the goal of consolidating larger tiles for higher scores.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to maximize merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|16|32|4  \nRow 1: 0|0|32|8  \nRow 2: 0|0|8|2  \nRow 3: 0|0|4|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Each row shifts left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist to merge. All rows remain mostly unchanged (e.g., Row 0 becomes `16|32|4|0`). No score is gained.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Each row shifts right, but no adjacent equal tiles exist to merge. Only Row 3 changes (from `0|0|4|0` to `0|0|0|4`). No score is gained.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Columns are processed, shifting tiles upward. Key observations:  \n   - **Column 2**: Contains `32` (Row 0), `32` (Row 1), `8` (Row 2), `4` (Row 3). The two `32`s merge into `64` (score +64). The merged column becomes `64|8|4|0`.  \n   - **Column 3**: Contains `4` (Row 0), `8` (Row 1), `2` (Row 2), `0` (Row 3). Tiles shift up, resulting in `4|8|2|0`.  \n   - After merging, the board becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|16|64|4  \n     Row 1: 0|0|8|8  \n     Row 2: 0|0|4|2  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   This positions the `64` (largest tile) in the top row, with `16` adjacent to it, and sets up `8`s in Row 1 for a potential future merge (e.g., swiping RIGHT).  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Columns are processed, shifting tiles downward. Key observations:  \n   - **Column 2**: Contains `32` (Row 0), `32` (Row 1), `8` (Row 2), `4` (Row 3). The two `32`s merge into `64` (score +64), but the merged column becomes `0|64|8|4`.  \n   - **Column 3**: Contains `4` (Row 0), `8` (Row 1), `2` (Row 2), `0` (Row 3). Tiles shift down, resulting in `0|4|8|2`.  \n   - After merging, the board becomes:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|64|4  \n     Row 2: 0|0|8|8  \n     Row 3: 0|16|4|2  \n     ```  \n   Here, the `64` is in Row 1, and the `16` is in the bottom row, which is less ideal for cornering larger tiles.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP is better because it positions the largest tile (`64`) in the top row, adjacent to `16`, and leaves empty space in the bottom row for future moves. The `8`s in Row 1 also set up a potential merge opportunity.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 2|16|64|4\nRow 1: 0|0|8|8\nRow 2: 0|0|4|2\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\nKey observations:\n- The only adjacent equal tiles are the two `8`s in Row 1 (columns 2 and 3).\n- Other tiles are distinct and cannot merge immediately.\n- The goal is to merge the `8`s and position larger tiles strategically (e.g., in a corner).\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### **UP**:\n- Swiping up shifts tiles upward. Columns 0–3 have no adjacent equal tiles, and tiles are already as high as possible. No movement or merging occurs. **Invalid move**.\n\n#### **DOWN**:\n- Swiping down shifts tiles downward. Columns 0–3 have no adjacent equal tiles, and tiles shift to the bottom but do not merge. No merging of the `8`s in Row 1 (they are in the same row, not column). **No meaningful merging**.\n\n#### **RIGHT**:\n- Swiping right shifts tiles to the right. In Row 1, the two `8`s shift right and merge into `16` (score +16). The merged `16` ends up in Row 1, column 3 (right end). Other rows (0, 2, 3) have no merging. This places the merged `16` in the right, but the larger tiles (64, 16 in Row 0) are not aligned with a corner.\n\n#### **LEFT**:\n- Swiping left shifts tiles to the left. In Row 1, the two `8`s shift left and merge into `16` (score +16). The merged `16` ends up in Row 1, column 0 (left end). Other rows (0, 2, 3) have no merging but remain stable. This places the merged `16` in the left, aligning with the top-left corner (Row 0, column 0 has a `2`), which supports a strategic corner-based growth pattern.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is optimal because it merges the `8`s into a `16` in the leftmost position of Row 1, aligning with the top-left corner. This setup facilitates future merging and strategic tile placement.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile positioning, and strategic advantage.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 16 | 64 | 4\nRow 1: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 4 | 2 | 0 | 4\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). The board remains mostly unchanged with no score gain. Not optimal.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (adjacent tiles are distinct). The board has minimal changes, with no score gain. Not optimal.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed upward. Key observation: Column 3 (values [4, 0, 4, 0]) has two 4s. When shifting up, these 4s stack in the top of the column (rows 0 and 1) and merge into an 8, yielding 8 points. \n- Post-merge board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 2 | 16 | 64 | 8\n  Row 1: 16 | 2 | 0 | 0\n  Row 2: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0\n  Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n  ```\n- The largest tile (64) is in the top-right corner, a strategic position. Smaller tiles (16, 8) are adjacent to 64, facilitating future merges.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed downward. Key observation: Column 3 (values [4, 0, 4, 0]) has two 4s. When shifting down, these 4s stack in the bottom of the column (rows 2 and 3) and merge into an 8, yielding 8 points. \n- Post-merge board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n  Row 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n  Row 2: 2 | 16 | 0 | 0\n  Row 3: 4 | 2 | 64 | 8\n  ```\n- The largest tile (64) is in the bottom-right corner, but the board has more empty spaces in the top rows, which may limit future merges.\n\n### Strategic Preference:\nWhile both UP and DOWN yield a merge (8 points), UP positions the largest tile (64) in the top-right corner with smaller tiles (16, 8) adjacent to it. This aligns with the 2048 strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner and arranging smaller tiles to facilitate future merges. UP is therefore the better move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

The grid remains mostly unchanged, with empty spaces filled by a new tile. No immediate or future merge opportunities are created.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles in each row shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles). Similar to LEFT, the grid structure remains unhelpful for future merges.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles in each column shift up, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles). Larger tiles (e.g., 64) stay in the top row, which is less ideal for corner-based strategies.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles in each column shift down. Key observations:  \n   - The 64 in row 0, column 2 moves to row 3, column 2 (bottom row), aligning with a corner-adjacent position.  \n   - The 16 in row 2, column 3 moves to row 3, column 3 (bottom-right corner).  \n   - After shifting, row 2 becomes `16 | 16 | 0 | 8` (from column 0 and 1 processing). These two 16s are now adjacent horizontally, creating a future merge opportunity (e.g., a subsequent LEFT swipe would merge them into 32).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping DOWN positions larger tiles (64, 16) in the bottom row (a strategic corner-adjacent area) and creates adjacent 16s in row 2, enabling a future merge. This aligns with the goal of maximizing scores through strategic tile placement.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential, future move opportunities, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 2|16|0|0\nRow 2: 16|16|0|8\nRow 3: 4|2|64|16\n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: No change (all zeros).\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left to `2|16|0|0` (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: The two `16`s merge into `32` (score +32), and the `8` shifts left: `32|8|0|0`.\n- **Row 3**: Tiles are distinct, so no merges: `4|2|64|16`.\n\n**Resulting Board (LEFT):**\n```\n0|0|0|0\n2|16|0|0\n32|8|0|0\n4|2|64|16\n```\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: No change (all zeros).\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right to `0|0|2|16` (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: The two `16`s merge into `32` (score +32), and the `8` shifts right: `0|0|8|32`.\n- **Row 3**: Tiles are distinct, so no merges: `4|2|64|16`.\n\n**Resulting Board (RIGHT):**\n```\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|2|16\n0|0|8|32\n4|2|64|16\n```\n\n### UP Move:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles `[0,2,16,4]` shift up to `2|16|4|0` (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: Tiles `[0,16,16,2]` merge the two `16`s into `32` (score +32), with the `2` shifting up: `32|2|0|0`.\n- **Column 2**: Tiles `[0,0,0,64]` shift up to `64|0|0|0` (no merges).\n- **Column 3**: Tiles `[0,0,8,16]` shift up to `8|16|0|0` (no merges).\n\n**Resulting Board (UP):**\n```\n2|32|64|8\n16|2|0|16\n4|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles `[0,2,16,4]` shift down to `0|0|2|16` (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: Tiles `[0,16,16,2]` merge the two `16`s into `32` (score +32), with the `2` shifting down: `0|0|2|32`.\n- **Column 2**: Tiles `[0,0,0,64]` shift down to `0|0|0|64` (no merges).\n- **Column 3**: Tiles `[0,0,8,16]` shift down to `0|0|8|16` (no merges).\n\n**Resulting Board (DOWN):**\n```\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n2|2|0|8\n16|32|64|16\n```\n\n### Strategic Evaluation:\n- **Merging Potential**: All directions merge two `16`s into `32` (score +32).\n- **Empty Tiles**: All directions leave 8 empty tiles, so no advantage here.\n- **Larger Tile Positioning**: \n  - UP moves the `64` to the top row (row 0, column 2), grouping larger tiles (32, 64) in the top row, which is ideal for future merges. \n  - UP also leaves the `16`s in row 1 (columns 0 and 3), which could merge with a right swipe later. \n  - Other directions spread larger tiles (e.g., 64 in row 3 for RIGHT\/LEFT\/DOWN), making future merges harder.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP move optimally positions larger tiles (32, 64) in the top row, creating better opportunities for future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 32 | 64 | 8\nRow 1: 16 | 2 | 16 | 16\nRow 2: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **UP**  \nProcessing columns upward:  \n- Column 0: [2, 16, 4, 0] (no merges, tiles shift up but remain distinct).  \n- Column 1: [32, 2, 0, 0] (no merges, tiles shift up).  \n- Column 2: [64, 16, 0, 0] (no merges, tiles shift up).  \n- Column 3: [8, 16, 0, 0] (no merges, tiles shift up).  \n**Result**: No merges occur.

The goal is to maximize score, merge tiles strategically, and position larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|4|8|4\nRow 1: 2|0|16|128\nRow 2: 0|0|32|2\nRow 3: 2|0|16|32\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Each row shifts left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n- Result: No score, minimal tile rearrangement.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Each row shifts right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n- Result: No score, minimal tile rearrangement.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed upward. Key observation: Column 0 has two 2s (row 1 and row 3). Shifting up merges these 2s into a 4 (score +4).  \n- Post-merge board:  \n  - Row 0: 4|4|8|4 (4 from merged 2s in column 0, 4 shifted up from column 1).  \n  - Rows 1-3: Empty spaces in columns 0-1, larger tiles (128, 32, 16) remain in their corners.  \n- Strategy: Positions 4s in row 0 (adjacent) for potential future left merge, keeping 128 in the top-right corner (a strategic corner).  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed downward.

However, UP positions 4s in row 0 (top row), which can be merged with a subsequent LEFT move, creating a higher-value tile (8). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners (128 in top-right) and setting up future merges.

The goal is to maximize future merging potential and keep larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board (rows 0-3):\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 4 | 8 | 4\nRow 1: 8 | 2 | 16 | 128\nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 32 | 2\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 16 | 32\n```\nKey observations:\n- The largest tile (128) is in the top-right corner (row 1, column 3).\n- Other large tiles (32, 16) are in the bottom-right region (rows 2-3, columns 2-3).\n- Empty tiles (zeros) are in rows 2-3, columns 0-1.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### 1. Swipe LEFT:\n- Tiles in rows 2 and 3 shift left (e.g., row 2: `0|0|32|2` → `32|2|0|0`; row 3: `0|0|16|32` → `16|32|0|0`).\n- No merges occur (all tiles in rows 0-1 are distinct and already left-aligned).\n- Zeros shift to the right (rows 2-3, columns 2-3). New tiles added here could block larger tiles (e.g., 128, 32) in the right.\n\n\n#### 2. Swipe RIGHT:\n- Tiles in rows 0-1 are already right-aligned (no movement).\n- Tiles in rows 2-3 are already right-aligned (no movement).\n- No merges or changes to the board. Zeros remain in rows 2-3, columns 0-1. No strategic benefit.\n\n\n#### 3. Swipe UP:\n- Columns are processed top-to-bottom. Tiles in columns 0-1 shift up (e.g., column 0: `2|8|0|0` → `2|8|0|0`; column 1: `4|2|0|0` → `4|2|0|0`).\n- Tiles in columns 2-3 are already top-aligned (no movement).\n- No merges occur. Zeros remain in rows 2-3, columns 0-1. No improvement in tile alignment.\n\n\n#### 4. Swipe DOWN:\n- Columns are processed bottom-to-top. Tiles in columns 0-1 shift down (e.g., column 0: `2|8|0|0` → `0|0|2|8`; column 1: `4|2|0|0` → `0|0|4|2`).\n- Tiles in columns 2-3 remain unchanged (no merges, already bottom-aligned).\n- Zeros shift to the top-left (rows 0-1, columns 0-1). New tiles added here (2 or 4) will be in the top-left, away from the larger tiles (128, 32) in the right, minimizing blocking of future merges.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping DOWN shifts empty tiles to the top-left, keeping larger tiles (128, 32) in the right corner. This aligns with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner and isolating new tiles in a less critical area, maximizing future merging potential.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities and keep larger tiles in a corner (e.g., 128 in the bottom-right corner).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|8|4\nRow 1: 0|8|16|128\nRow 2: 2|4|32|2\nRow 3: 8|2|16|32\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     Row 0: 8|4|0|0  \n     Row 1: 8|16|128|0  \n     Row 2: 2|4|32|2  \n     Row 3: 8|2|16|32  \n   - No immediate merges; zeros are created on the right, but this does not strategically position larger tiles.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct).  \n   - Resulting board remains nearly unchanged, with no meaningful shifts or merges.  \n   - Larger tiles (e.g., 128) stay in place, but no progress toward corner consolidation.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift up, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in columns are distinct).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     Row 0: 2|8|8|4  \n     Row 1: 8|4|16|128  \n     Row 2: 0|2|32|2  \n     Row 3: 0|0|16|32  \n   - While row 0 gains adjacent 8s, merging would require a subsequent left swipe. However, this does not prioritize consolidating the largest tile (128) in a corner.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift down, with the key objective of moving the largest tile (128) toward the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3).  \n   - Column 3 (containing 128) shifts down, moving 128 closer to the bottom.  \n   - Other tiles (e.g., 32s, 16s) in lower rows are positioned to potentially merge in future moves.  \n   - Resulting board after shifting (no immediate merges, but strategic positioning):  \n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|8|4  \n     Row 2: 2|8|16|128  \n     Row 3: 8|4|32|32 (example; exact positions depend on tile shifts, but 128 moves closer to the corner).  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping **DOWN** strategically moves the largest tile (128) toward the bottom-right corner, positions smaller tiles for future merges, and aligns with the goal of consolidating larger tiles in a corner.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities, tile positioning, and strategic preservation of large tiles (especially the 128 in the bottom-right corner).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 0 | 8 | 4\nRow 1: 0 | 8 | 16 | 128\nRow 2: 2 | 4 | 32 | 2\nRow 3: 8 | 2 | 16 | 32\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The largest tile is 128, positioned in the bottom-right corner (Row 1, Column 3). Preserving this corner for large tiles is strategic.\n- Merging tiles to increase score and create space is critical.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: [8, 0, 8, 4] shifts left → [8, 8, 4, 0]. Merges 8+8=16, score +16. New row: [16, 4, 0, 0].\n- **Row 1**: [0, 8, 16, 128] shifts left → [8, 16, 128, 0]. 128 moves from Column 3 to Column 2 (no longer in the corner).\n- **Rows 2 and 3**: No merges (tiles are distinct).  \n**Issue**: 128 leaves the corner, reducing strategic stability.\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: [8, 0, 8, 4] shifts right → [0, 8, 8, 4]. Merges 8+8=16, score +16. New row: [0, 0, 16, 4].\n- **Row 1**: [0, 8, 16, 128] shifts right → remains [0, 8, 16, 128] (128 stays in Column 3, preserving the corner).\n- **Rows 2 and 3**: No merges (tiles are distinct).  \n**Advantage**: 128 stays in the corner, and Row 0 gains a merged 16.\n\n#### **UP Move**:\n- Columns are processed upward. No merges occur in any column, as adjacent tiles are distinct. The 128 remains in Row 1, Column 3, but no meaningful merging or space creation occurs.  \n**Issue**: No score gain or strategic improvement.\n\n#### **DOWN Move**:\n- Columns are processed downward. No merges occur in any column, as adjacent tiles are distinct. The 128 remains in Row 1, Column 3, but no meaningful merging or space creation occurs.  \n**Issue**: No score gain or strategic improvement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe RIGHT move preserves the 128 in the bottom-right corner, merges two 8s in Row 0 for a score gain, and avoids disrupting the positioning of larger tiles. This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners and prioritizing merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

The goal is to identify a move that maximizes merging opportunities or strategically positions larger tiles for future merges.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 4 | 64 | 4\nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 32 | 128\nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 64 | 2\nRow 3: 8 | 2 | 16 | 64\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: [0, 4, 64, 4] → Shifts left to [4, 64, 4, 0] (no merges, as 4s are separated by 64).  \n   - **Row 1**: [0, 0, 32, 128] → Shifts left to [32, 128, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - **Row 2**: [64, 8, 64, 2] → No shifts (all non-zero, no adjacent duplicates).  \n   - **Row 3**: [8, 2, 16, 64] → No shifts (all non-zero, no adjacent duplicates).  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges, but shifts tiles left, creating empty spaces on the right for future merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: [0, 4, 64, 4] → Shifts right to [0, 4, 64, 4] (no merges, as 4s are separated by 64).  \n   - **Row 1**: [0, 0, 32, 128] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 32, 128] (no merges).  \n   - **Row 2**: [64, 8, 64, 2] → No shifts (all non-zero, no adjacent duplicates).  \n   - **Row 3**: [8, 2, 16, 64] → No shifts (all non-zero, no adjacent duplicates).  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges, with tiles already aligned right.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - **Column 0**: [0, 0, 64, 8] → Shifts up to [64, 8, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - **Column 1**: [4, 0, 8, 2] → Shifts up to [4, 8, 2, 0] (no merges).  \n   - **Column 2**: [64, 32, 64, 16] → Shifts up to [64, 32, 64, 16] (no merges, as 64s are separated by 32).  \n   - **Column 3**: [4, 128, 2, 64] → Shifts up to [4, 128, 2, 64] (no merges).  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges, with tiles shifted upward but no adjacent duplicates.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - **Column 0**: [0, 0, 64, 8] → Shifts down to [0, 0, 64, 8] (no merges).  \n   - **Column 1**: [4, 0, 8, 2] → Shifts down to [0, 4, 8, 2] (no merges).  \n   - **Column 2**: [64, 32, 64, 16] → Shifts down to [64, 32, 64, 16] (no merges, as 64s are separated by 32).  \n   - **Column 3**: [4, 128, 2, 64] → Shifts down to [4, 128, 2, 64] (no merges).  \n   - **Outcome**: No merges, with tiles shifted downward but no adjacent duplicates.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the directions result in immediate merges. However, **LEFT** is chosen because it shifts tiles to the left, creating empty spaces on the right. This setup allows for potential future merges (e.g., 4s in Row 0 could align if new tiles spawn on the right).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down, focusing on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 64 | 4 | 2\nRow 1: 32 | 128 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 64 | 2\nRow 3: 8 | 2 | 16 | 64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **Left Swipe**:\n- No merges occur in any row. Tiles in rows with zeros (Row 1) shift left but remain unmerged. No strategic benefit.\n\n#### **Right Swipe**:\n- Tiles in rows with zeros (Row 1) shift right but remain unmerged. No merges in other rows. No strategic benefit.\n\n#### **Down Swipe**:\n- Column 3 (values: 2, 0, 2, 64) shifts down, merging the two 2s into a 4 (score +4). However, this leaves 4 in Row 2, Column 3, with 64 in the bottom-right corner. No other merges occur, and no meaningful setup for future moves.\n\n#### **Up Swipe**:\n- Column 3 (values: 2, 0, 2, 64) shifts up, merging the two 2s into a 4 (score +4). \n- Column 2 (values: 4, 0, 64, 16) shifts up, resulting in 4, 64, 16, 0. \n- **Key Setup**: Row 1 (originally 32, 128, 0, 0) becomes 32, 128, 64, 64 after the up swipe. This creates adjacent 64s in Row 1, Columns 2 and 3, which can merge into 128 (score +128) with a subsequent right swipe. This setup aligns with strategic goals of merging larger tiles and positioning them toward corners.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe up swipe not only merges the 2s in Column 3 but also sets up a critical merge of 64s in Row 1 for the next move. This strategic positioning of tiles (e.g., 64s in Row 1) is more valuable than the down swipe, which offers no such future opportunities.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the resulting tile positions, merges, and strategic value (e.g., corner placement of large tiles).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|64|4|4\nRow 1: 32|128|64|64\nRow 2: 64|8|16|64\nRow 3: 8|2|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: 4, 64, 4, 4 → merge the two rightmost 4s into 8 → new row: `4|64|8|0` (score +8).  \n- **Row 1**: 32, 128, 64, 64 → merge the two rightmost 64s into 128 → new row: `32|128|128|0` (score +128).  \n- **Rows 2 and 3**: No merges (distinct tiles or zeros).  \n- **Total Score**: 8 + 128 = 136.  \n- **Issue**: Merged tiles (8, 128) are not in corners, and empty spaces are on the right, which may not align with strategic corner placement.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: 4, 64, 4, 4 → reverse and process left, merge the two leftmost 4s into 8 → new row: `0|4|64|8` (score +8).  \n- **Row 1**: 32, 128, 64, 64 → reverse and process left, merge the two leftmost 64s into 128 → new row: `0|32|128|128` (score +128).  \n- **Rows 2 and 3**: No merges.  \n- **Total Score**: 8 + 128 = 136.  \n- **Issue**: Merged tiles (8, 128) are not in corners, and empty spaces are on the left, which may disrupt tile alignment.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 3**: 4, 64, 64, 0 → merge the two 64s (rows 1 and 2) into 128 → new column: `4|128|0|0` (score +128).  \n- **Other Columns**: No merges (distinct tiles).  \n- **Total Score**: 128.  \n- **Issue**: The merged 128 is in row 1, column 3 (not a corner), limiting future merge potential.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 3**: 4, 64, 64, 0 → reverse and process up, merge the two 64s (rows 1 and 2 of the reversed column) into 128 → new column: `0|0|4|128` (score +128).  \n- **Column 2**: 4, 64, 16, 0 → reverse and process up, shift tiles down → new column: `0|4|64|16`.  \n- **Other Columns**: No merges.  \n- **Resulting Board**:  \n  Row 0: `4|64|0|0`  \n  Row 1: `32|128|4|0`  \n  Row 2: `64|8|64|4`  \n  Row 3: `8|2|16|128`  \n- **Strategic Value**: The merged 128 is placed in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), a key position for building larger tiles (e.g., 2048) by keeping large tiles in corners. Empty spaces are on the top, avoiding interference with the corner.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nDOWN is optimal because it places the merged 128 in the bottom-right corner, aligning with strategic corner placement for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities, tile positioning, and future move potential.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 64 | 0 | 64\nRow 1: 32 | 128 | 4 | 0\nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 64 | 4\nRow 3: 8 | 2 | 16 | 128\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: `[4, 64, 0, 64]` → Non-zero tiles `[4, 64, 64]` merge to `[4, 128]` (score +128). Final row: `[4, 128, 0, 0]`.\n- **Row 1**: `[32, 128, 4, 0]` → Non-zero tiles `[32, 128, 4]` (no merges). Final row: `[32, 128, 4, 0]`.\n- **Row 2**: `[64, 8, 64, 4]` → Non-zero tiles `[64, 8, 64, 4]` (no merges). Final row: `[64, 8, 64, 4]`.\n- **Row 3**: `[8, 2, 16, 128]` → Non-zero tiles (no merges). Final row: `[8, 2, 16, 128]`.\n- **Result**: 3 empty tiles. Two 128s in column 1 (rows 0 and 1) could merge with a future UP move.\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: `[4, 64, 0, 64]` → Non-zero tiles `[4, 64, 64]` reversed → `[64, 64, 4]` merge to `[128, 4]`, reversed back → `[4, 128]`. Final row: `[0, 4, 128, 0]` (score +128).\n- **Row 1**: `[32, 128, 4, 0]` → Non-zero tiles `[32, 128, 4]` reversed → `[4, 128, 32]` (no merges), reversed back → `[32, 128, 4]`. Final row: `[0, 32, 128, 4]`.\n- **Row 2**: `[64, 8, 64, 4]` → Non-zero tiles (no merges). Final row: `[64, 8, 64, 4]`.\n- **Row 3**: `[8, 2, 16, 128]` → Non-zero tiles (no merges). Final row: `[8, 2, 16, 128]`.\n- **Result**: 3 empty tiles. Two 128s in column 2 (rows 0 and 1) could merge with a future UP move. Additionally, column 3 (rows 1 and 2) has two 4s, which can merge with a future DOWN move (potential 8 score).\n\n#### **UP\/DOWN Moves**:\n- **UP**: No merges occur. Only 2 empty tiles remain.\n- **DOWN**: No merges occur. Only 2 empty tiles remain.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 128 score and 3 empty tiles. However, RIGHT sets up a future merge opportunity (two 4s in column 3) and maintains strategic tile positioning for subsequent moves. Thus, RIGHT is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 2 | 4 | 128\nRow 1: 0 | 32 | 128 | 4\nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 64 | 4\nRow 3: 8 | 2 | 16 | 128\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \nShifting left moves tiles to the left edge of each row. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any row, so no merges occur. Score gain: 0.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nShifting right moves tiles to the right edge of each row. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any row, so no merges occur. Score gain: 0.  \n\n#### **UP**  \nShifting up moves tiles upward, merging vertically. Only column 3 has adjacent equal tiles:  \n- Column 3: `[128, 4, 4, 128]`. The two 4s in rows 1 and 2 merge into 8 (score +8). After merging, the 128 in row 3 shifts up to row 2. The resulting column 3 becomes `[128, 8, 128, 0]`. Other columns have no merges.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \nShifting down moves tiles downward, merging vertically. Only column 3 has adjacent equal tiles:  \n- Column 3: `[128, 4, 4, 128]`. The two 4s in rows 1 and 2 merge into 8 (score +8). After merging, the 128 in row 0 shifts down to row 1. The resulting column 3 becomes `[0, 128, 8, 128]`. Other columns have no merges.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:  \nBoth UP and DOWN yield a merge (4+4=8) for 8 points. However, DOWN is preferable because it consolidates larger tiles (128s) in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), a strategic corner to prioritize for future merges. This placement aligns with the goal of keeping larger tiles in a corner to maximize merging potential.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN.

No score.  \n\n\n### Decision:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 320 points, but RIGHT positions the 256 tile in the top-right corner, aligning with strategic advice to keep larger tiles in corners. This setup improves future merge potential (e.g., with the 128 tile in row 3, column 3).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging rules.

It merges the 32s in row 0 (gaining 64 points), preserves the 256 in the right corner, and aligns the new 64 with the right column for future merging opportunities.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (e.g., merging tiles, positioning large tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|128|64|4\nRow 1: 0|16|2|256\nRow 2: 64|8|128|8\nRow 3: 8|2|16|128\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct).  \n   - Row 0 becomes `128|64|4|0` (0 in column 3).  \n   - Row 1 becomes `16|2|256|0` (0 in column 3).  \n   - Rows 2 and 3 remain unchanged (no zeros to shift into).  \n   - Large tiles (128, 256) are spread across columns 0–2, moving away from the right corner.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct).  \n   - Rows 0, 1, 2, and 3 remain mostly unchanged (tiles are already as far right as possible).  \n   - Large tiles (256 in row 1, column 3; 128 in row 3, column 3) stay in the rightmost column (column 3), a strategic corner.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift up, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in columns are distinct).  \n   - Column 0 becomes `64|8|0|0` (zeros in rows 2–3).  \n   - Other columns remain unchanged.  \n   - Large tiles (128, 256) are scattered, with no clear corner concentration.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in columns are distinct).  \n   - Columns remain mostly unchanged (tiles are already as far down as possible).  \n   - Large tiles (256, 128) stay in their positions but do not reinforce a corner.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe key goal is to keep large tiles in a corner to facilitate future merges. The rightmost column (column 3) already contains the largest tiles: 256 (row 1, column 3) and 128 (row 3, column 3). Swiping RIGHT preserves these tiles in the right corner, aligning with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner for potential future merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential, tile movement, and strategic placement of large tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 128 | 64 | 4\nRow 1: 4 | 16 | 2 | 256\nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 128 | 8\nRow 3: 8 | 2 | 16 | 128\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift right. No adjacent tiles in any row are equal, so no merges occur. Tiles in row 0 (0, 128, 64, 4) cannot shift right (already at the right edge). Other rows have no empty spaces to move into. **No valid movement.**\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift down. Columns are checked for merges or movement. All columns have distinct values, and no tiles can shift down into empty spaces (only one empty tile in row 0, column 0). **No valid movement.**\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift up. Columns are checked for merges or movement. Column 0 (0, 4, 64, 8) can shift up: 4 moves to row 0, 64 to row 1, 8 to row 2, and 0 to row 3. However, no merges occur, and large tiles (e.g., 128 in row 0, column 1) remain in non-corner positions. **Valid but suboptimal.**\n\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift left. Row 0 (0, 128, 64, 4) shifts left: 128 moves to column 0 (top-left corner), 64 to column 1, 4 to column 2, and 0 to column 3. No merges in other rows, but this move strategically places the 128 tile in the top-left corner (a strong position for future merges). Other large tiles (256 in row 1, column 3; 128 in row 3, column 3) remain in corners. **Valid and optimal.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the best move, as it strategically positions the 128 tile in a corner while maintaining other large tiles in corners.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128|64|4|4  \nRow 1: 4|16|2|256  \nRow 2: 64|8|128|8  \nRow 3: 8|2|16|128  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two `4`s in columns 2 and 3 merge into `8`. New row: `128|64|8|0`. Score from merge: `8`.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles are distinct (`4|16|2|256`), so they shift left with no merges.  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles are distinct (`64|8|128|8`), so they shift left with no merges.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles are distinct (`8|2|16|128`), so they shift left with no merges.  \n   **Total Score**: `8`.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles shift right.

No merges occur.  \n   **Total Score**: `0`.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield `8` points, but the goal is to keep larger tiles in corners and facilitate future merges. The `256` (row 1, column 3) and `128`s (row 0, column 0; row 3, column 3) are already in corners. Swiping LEFT merges the `4`s in row 0, consolidating smaller tiles toward the left edge (row 0 becomes `128|64|8|0`). This positions smaller tiles (`8`) adjacent to larger tiles (`64`, `128`) in the left, creating opportunities for future merges (e.g., if another `8` appears in column 3, a subsequent LEFT swipe could merge them into `16`).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules.

By the rules, there are **no valid moves** because there are no merges possible and no empty spaces to shift tiles into.

For example:\n  - Row 0: 128, 64, 8, 64 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 1: 4, 16, 2, 256 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 2: 64, 8, 128, 8 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 3: 8, 2, 16, 128 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - All columns also have no adjacent equal tiles.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN:** Since there are no adjacent equal tiles and no empty spaces, swiping in any direction will not result in merges or tile shifts. All moves leave the board unchanged, making them invalid under the rules (valid moves require either merging adjacent tiles or shifting into empty spaces).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent equal tiles, so no valid moves exist.

For example, Row 0 has [128, 64, 8, 64] (no duplicates), Row 1 has [4, 16, 2, 256] (no duplicates), Row 2 has [64, 8, 128, 8] (no duplicates), and Row 3 has [8, 2, 16, 128] (no duplicates).

No merges or shifts are possible.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied, and there are no adjacent tiles of the same number in any row or column. Thus, **no valid moves** exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and all directions are invalid, the answer defaults to this conclusion.  \n\nAnswer: NO_VALID_MOVE  \n\n**Note**: The problem constraints require the answer to be one of LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Since no valid moves exist, but the format requires selecting one, the intended answer may be inferred as none, but per the problem’s structure, the answer is provided as above.  \n\nAnswer: NO_VALID_MOVE","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 game board. The goal is to identify if any direction allows tiles to merge or shift into empty spaces (valid moves). The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 64 | 8 | 64\nRow 1: 4 | 16 | 2 | 256\nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 128 | 8\nRow 3: 8 | 2 | 16 | 128\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Each row is processed left to right. Tiles shift left, and adjacent equal tiles merge.  \n   - Row 0: [128, 64, 8, 64] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Row 1: [4, 16, 2, 256] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Row 2: [64, 8, 128, 8] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Row 3: [8, 2, 16, 128] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   **Result**: No merges or shifts. Invalid move.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Each row is processed right to left. Tiles shift right, and adjacent equal tiles merge.  \n   - Row 0: [128, 64, 8, 64] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Row 1: [4, 16, 2, 256] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Row 2: [64, 8, 128, 8] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Row 3: [8, 2, 16, 128] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   **Result**: No merges or shifts. Invalid move.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Each column is processed top to bottom. Tiles shift up, and adjacent equal tiles merge.  \n   - Column 0: [128, 4, 64, 8] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Column 1: [64, 16, 8, 2] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Column 2: [8, 2, 128, 16] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Column 3: [64, 256, 8, 128] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   **Result**: No merges or shifts. Invalid move.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Each column is processed bottom to top. Tiles shift down, and adjacent equal tiles merge.  \n   - Column 0: [128, 4, 64, 8] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Column 1: [64, 16, 8, 2] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Column 2: [8, 2, 128, 16] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Column 3: [64, 256, 8, 128] has no adjacent equal tiles.  \n   **Result**: No merges or shifts. Invalid move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions result in no valid moves, as there are no adjacent equal tiles to merge and no empty spaces to shift tiles into. The grid is full, and no merges are possible in any direction.\n\nAnswer: NO_VALID_MOVE (Note: Since the problem requires selecting from LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, but no valid moves exist, this is a special case. However, based on the given constraints, the intended answer may assume a valid move exists, but analysis shows none.) \n\n(Note: The problem may expect a direction despite no valid moves, but based on the rules, there are no valid moves. However, per the problem's requirement to choose from the four options, the answer is provided as per the instructions.) \n\nAnswer: LEFT (or any direction, but LEFT is arbitrary as no valid moves exist)","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merge opportunities and strategic tile placement. The current grid is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 128|64|8|64  \nRow 1: 4|16|2|256  \nRow 2: 64|8|128|8  \nRow 3: 8|2|16|128  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid Status**: The grid is completely full (no empty tiles, 0s).  \n2. **Merge Opportunities**: No adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. For example:  \n   - Row 0: 128, 64, 8, 64 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n   - Row 2: 64, 8, 128, 8 (8s are separated by 128, not adjacent).  \n   - All columns also lack adjacent duplicates.  \n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: Since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, none of these moves will result in tile merges or shifts. All directions leave the grid unchanged, as there are no empty spaces to move tiles into.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nWith no valid merges and a full grid, the game would typically end. However, since the problem requires selecting a direction, we prioritize keeping larger tiles (e.g., 256, 128s) in corners for future opportunities. The 256 is in the bottom-right area, and 128s are spread across corners. A downward move aligns with consolidating tiles toward the bottom, which might preserve flexibility if a new tile (2\/4) is added (though the grid is full here).  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 64 | 8 | 64\nRow 1: 4 | 16 | 2 | 256\nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 128 | 8\nRow 3: 8 | 2 | 16 | 128\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No Empty Tiles**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no zeros), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **No Immediate Merges**: Checking all rows and columns, there are no adjacent tiles with the same value. For example:\n  - Row 0: 128, 64, 8, 64 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 1: 4, 16, 2, 256 (all distinct).\n  - Row 2: 64, 8, 128, 8 (8s are non-adjacent).\n  - Row 3: 8, 2, 16, 128 (all distinct).\n  - Columns: All columns also lack adjacent duplicates.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP**: Swiping in these directions does not result in any tile merges because there are no adjacent duplicates to merge, and all tiles are already tightly packed (no empty spaces to shift into).\n- **DOWN**: Similarly, swiping down does not cause merges, but it aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles (e.g., 256 in Row 1, Column 3; 128 in Row 3, Column 3) in the bottom-right corner, which is a common optimal strategy for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile no immediate merges are possible, swiping DOWN aligns with strategic positioning to preserve larger tiles in a corner, facilitating potential future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges and valid moves. The grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles, 0s), so valid moves depend on adjacent tiles of the same value. \n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 128 | 64 | 8 | 64  \nRow 1: 4 | 16 | 2 | 256  \nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 128 | 8  \nRow 3: 8 | 2 | 16 | 128  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: For each row, shifting left or right would not merge any tiles because no adjacent tiles in the rows are equal. All rows are full, so tiles cannot shift into empty spaces.  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: For each column, shifting up or down would also not merge any tiles, as no adjacent tiles in the columns are equal. All columns are full, so tiles cannot shift into empty spaces.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and there are no adjacent tiles with the same value. Thus, no merges are possible in any direction. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Since no direction offers a strategic advantage, any direction is technically valid (though no merges occur). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and game rules.

No merges occur, and the grid remains full with no shifting. **Invalid move**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Each column is processed top-to-bottom.

No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, and no tiles can shift up. **Invalid move**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Each column is processed bottom-to-top. All columns have distinct values (e.g., Column 1: 64, 16, 8, 2; Column 2: 8, 2, 128, 16; etc.).

However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any direction is technically invalid, but a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile movement. The current board is fully occupied (no empty tiles, 0s), and we need to check for adjacent tiles that can merge or spaces to move tiles into (valid moves).\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 128 | 64 | 8 | 64  \nRow 1: 4 | 16 | 2 | 256  \nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 128 | 8  \nRow 3: 8 | 2 | 16 | 128  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows are fully occupied with distinct or non-adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift left (no empty spaces).  \n   - Example: Row 0 (128, 64, 8, 64) has 64s at positions 1 and 3 (non-adjacent), so no merge. Other rows similarly have no merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - All rows are fully occupied with distinct or non-adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift right (no empty spaces).  \n   - Example: Row 2 (64, 8, 128, 8) has 8s at positions 1 and 3 (non-adjacent), so no merge.

No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift up (no empty spaces).  \n   - Example: Column 0 (128, 4, 64, 8) has all distinct values, so no merge. Other columns similarly have no merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - All columns are fully occupied with distinct tiles. No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift down (no empty spaces).  \n   - Example: Column 3 (64, 256, 8, 128) has all distinct values, so no merge. Other columns similarly have no merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is completely full, and there are no adjacent tiles with the same value (horizontally or vertically). Since there are no empty spaces to move tiles into and no merges possible, **no valid moves exist**. However, the problem requires selecting one of the directions, so a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or tile shifts in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent equal tiles to merge.

No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles are 4, 16, 2, 256. No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles are 64, 8, 128, 8. No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Row 3: Tiles are 8, 2, 16, 128. No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles are 128, 64, 8, 64. No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Row 1: Tiles are 4, 16, 2, 256. No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Row 2: Tiles are 64, 8, 128, 8.

This means no valid moves exist (since valid moves require either adjacent equal tiles to merge or empty spaces to shift tiles into). However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and all directions result in no movement or merges, any direction could be chosen. For consistency, we select **LEFT**.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles. The current game board is:\n\n```\n128|64|8|64\n4|16|2|256\n64|8|128|8\n8|2|16|128\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Each row is processed leftward. No adjacent tiles in any row are equal, so no merges occur. All tiles remain in their current positions as the row is fully occupied.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Each row is processed rightward. Similarly, no adjacent tiles in any row are equal, so no merges occur. All tiles remain in their current positions as the row is fully occupied.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Each column is processed upward. No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, so no merges occur. All tiles remain in their current positions as the column is fully occupied.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Each column is processed downward. No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, so no merges occur. All tiles remain in their current positions as the column is fully occupied.  \n\n### Key Observations:  \n- The grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles), and no two adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. Thus, no valid merges are possible for any direction.  \n- Since the game has not yet reached the 100th epoch, a move must still be chosen. Given the lack of immediate merges, the choice prioritizes strategic positioning. Larger tiles (e.g., 256, 128s) are spread across the grid, but no direction clearly improves their grouping.  \n\nGiven the constraints, any direction is technically valid (as the game does not end until the 100th epoch or no valid moves). A common strategy is to prefer directions that might set up future merges, but with no immediate advantage, any direction is acceptable.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and 2048 game rules. The goal is to identify valid moves (tiles can shift into empty spaces or merge adjacent equal tiles) and prioritize strategic merging to maximize scores.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 1: 128|64|8|64  \nRow 2: 4|16|2|256  \nRow 3: 64|8|128|8  \nRow 4: 8|2|16|128  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   For each row, tiles shift left, merging adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - Row 1: [128, 64, 8, 64] (no adjacent duplicates; no change).  \n   - Row 2: [4, 16, 2, 256] (no adjacent duplicates; no change).  \n   - Row 3: [64, 8, 128, 8] (no adjacent duplicates; no change).  \n   - Row 4: [8, 2, 16, 128] (no adjacent duplicates; no change).  \n   **Result**: No merges or shifts. Invalid move.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   For each row, tiles shift right, merging adjacent equal tiles (processed by reversing the row, merging left, then reversing back).  \n   - Row 1: [128, 64, 8, 64] → reversed [64, 8, 64, 128] (no adjacent duplicates; no change).  \n   - Row 2: [4, 16, 2, 256] → reversed [256, 2, 16, 4] (no adjacent duplicates; no change).  \n   - Row 3: [64, 8, 128, 8] → reversed [8, 128, 8, 64] (no adjacent duplicates; no change).  \n   - Row 4: [8, 2, 16, 128] → reversed [128, 16, 2, 8] (no adjacent duplicates; no change).  \n   **Result**: No merges or shifts.

Invalid move.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   For each column, tiles shift down, merging adjacent equal tiles (bottom to top, processed by reversing the column, merging up, then reversing back).  \n   - Column 1: [128, 4, 64, 8] → reversed [8, 64, 4, 128] (no adjacent duplicates; no change).  \n   - Column 2: [64, 16, 8, 2] → reversed [2, 8, 16, 64] (no adjacent duplicates; no change).  \n   - Column 3: [8, 2, 128, 16] → reversed [16, 128, 2, 8] (no adjacent duplicates; no change).  \n   - Column 4: [64, 256, 8, 128] → reversed [128, 8, 256, 64] (no adjacent duplicates; no change).  \n   **Result**: No merges or shifts. Invalid move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are invalid because there are no adjacent equal tiles to merge and no empty spaces to shift tiles into. However, the problem requires selecting one of the options. Given the example provided, \"DOWN\" is chosen as a default.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or tile movements in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The current board has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent equal tiles that can merge.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 128 | 64 | 8 | 64  \nRow 1: 4 | 16 | 2 | 256  \nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 128 | 8  \nRow 3: 8 | 2 | 16 | 128  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   All rows are fully occupied with no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 0 (128, 64, 8, 64) has no adjacent duplicates, and no tiles can shift left (no empty spaces). This applies to all rows. No merges or movement occur.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   Similarly, all rows are fully occupied. For example, Row 2 (64, 8, 128, 8) has 8s separated by 128 (not adjacent), so no merges. Tiles cannot shift right (no empty spaces). No valid moves here.  \n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   All columns are fully occupied. Column 0 (128, 4, 64, 8) has no adjacent equal tiles, and tiles cannot shift up (no empty spaces). This applies to all columns. No merges or movement occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   All columns are fully occupied. Column 3 (64, 256, 8, 128) has no adjacent equal tiles, and tiles cannot shift down (no empty spaces). No valid moves here.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe grid is full (no empty tiles), and there are no adjacent equal tiles in any direction. By the rules, there are no valid moves left.

This means no merges are possible in any direction. However, the game has not yet ended (epoch 88 < 100), so a move must still be chosen. To align with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners, the 256 (row 1, column 3) and 128s (row 0, column 0; row 2, column 2; row 3, column 3) are already positioned in corners. Moving DOWN maintains the existing corner alignment of larger tiles.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and the game rules. The key is to check for valid moves, defined as either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or moving tiles into empty spaces. The grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves must involve merging adjacent tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\n128|64|8|64\n4|16|2|256\n64|8|128|8\n8|2|16|128\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows are full (no 0s).

No merges occur.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number. All moves are invalid (no merges or empty spaces to shift into). However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any direction is technically a valid answer under the given constraints.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or shifts in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The current grid is fully occupied (no 0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number to merge. \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: All rows have distinct adjacent tiles. For example, Row 0: [128, 64, 8, 64] has no adjacent duplicates. No merges or shifts occur.  \n- **RIGHT**: Similarly, all rows have distinct adjacent tiles. Row 2: [64, 8, 128, 8] has 8s separated by 128, so no merges. No shifts occur.  \n- **UP**: All columns have distinct adjacent tiles. Column 0: [128, 4, 64, 8] has no duplicates. No merges or shifts.  \n- **DOWN**: All columns have distinct adjacent tiles. Column 3: [64, 256, 8, 128] has no duplicates. No merges or shifts.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent tiles of the same number, meaning no valid merges or shifts are possible in any direction. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we choose arbitrarily (as no direction is more optimal than others).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential for merging tiles in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to identify which move allows for the most strategic merging or avoids immediate game termination.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 128 | 64 | 8 | 64  \nRow 1: 4 | 16 | 2 | 256  \nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 128 | 8  \nRow 3: 8 | 2 | 16 | 128  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Each row is compressed left. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any row (e.g., Row 0: 128, 64, 8, 64; Row 1: 4, 16, 2, 256; Row 2: 64, 8, 128, 8; Row 3: 8, 2, 16, 128). No merges occur.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row is compressed right. Similarly, no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row (e.g., Row 0: 128, 64, 8, 64; Row 1: 4, 16, 2, 256; Row 2: 64, 8, 128, 8; Row 3: 8, 2, 16, 128). No merges occur.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Each column is compressed upward. All columns have distinct values (e.g., Column 0: 128, 4, 64, 8; Column 1: 64, 16, 8, 2; Column 2: 8, 2, 128, 16; Column 3: 64, 256, 8, 128). No merges occur.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Each column is compressed downward. All columns have distinct values (same as UP analysis). No merges occur.  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) are equal. By the rules, a valid move requires either adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to shift tiles into. Since there are no empty spaces or adjacent equal tiles, **all moves are technically invalid**. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.  \n\n\nGiven the lack of valid merges, any direction is functionally equivalent. For consistency, we select the first direction (LEFT).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of merging tiles and maximizing score. The current epoch is 98, with 2 epochs remaining before the game ends. The grid is fully occupied (no 0s), so valid moves require either merging adjacent equal tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend on merging adjacent equal tiles.\n\n### Grid Analysis:\nThe game board is:\n```\nRow 0: 128 | 64 | 8 | 64\nRow 1: 4 | 16 | 2 | 256\nRow 2: 64 | 8 | 128 | 8\nRow 3: 8 | 2 | 16 | 128\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [128, 64, 8, 64] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Row 1: [4, 16, 2, 256] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Row 2: [64, 8, 128, 8] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Row 3: [8, 2, 16, 128] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   Result: No merges or shifts.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [128, 64, 8, 64] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Row 1: [4, 16, 2, 256] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Row 2: [64, 8, 128, 8] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Row 3: [8, 2, 16, 128] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   Result: No merges or shifts.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: [128, 4, 64, 8] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Column 1: [64, 16, 8, 2] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Column 2: [8, 2, 128, 16] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Column 3: [64, 256, 8, 128] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   Result: No merges or shifts.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: [128, 4, 64, 8] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Column 1: [64, 16, 8, 2] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Column 2: [8, 2, 128, 16] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   - Column 3: [64, 256, 8, 128] → No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n   Result: No merges or shifts.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions fail to produce merges or shifts since the grid is full and no adjacent tiles are equal. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, any direction is equally invalid, but we arbitrarily choose **LEFT** as the answer.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and check for valid moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules. A valid move requires either adjacent tiles of the same number (which can merge) or empty spaces (0s) to shift tiles into. The current grid has no empty spaces (all tiles are non-zero), so valid moves depend on the presence of adjacent duplicates.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128|64|8|64  \nRow 1: 4|16|2|256  \nRow 2: 64|8|128|8  \nRow 3: 8|2|16|128  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   - All rows have no adjacent duplicates. For example, Row 0: `128,64,8,64` (no duplicates), Row 1: `4,16,2,256` (no duplicates), Row 2: `64,8,128,8` (no duplicates), Row 3: `8,2,16,128` (no duplicates). Tiles cannot shift left (no empty spaces) and no merges occur. **Invalid**.\n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - All rows have no adjacent duplicates. For example, Row 0: `128,64,8,64` (no duplicates), Row 1: `4,16,2,256` (no duplicates), Row 2: `64,8,128,8` (no duplicates), Row 3: `8,2,16,128` (no duplicates). Tiles cannot shift right (no empty spaces) and no merges occur. **Invalid**.\n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   - All columns have no adjacent duplicates. For example, Column 0: `128,4,64,8` (no duplicates), Column 1: `64,16,8,2` (no duplicates), Column 2: `8,2,128,16` (no duplicates), Column 3: `64,256,8,128` (no duplicates). Tiles cannot shift up (no empty spaces) and no merges occur. **Invalid**.\n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   - All columns have no adjacent duplicates. For example, Column 0: `128,4,64,8` (no duplicates), Column 1: `64,16,8,2` (no duplicates), Column 2: `8,2,128,16` (no duplicates), Column 3: `64,256,8,128` (no duplicates). Tiles cannot shift down (no empty spaces) and no merges occur. **Invalid**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full (no empty spaces), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number. All moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are invalid. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Since no valid moves exist, any direction is technically acceptable, but the answer must be chosen as per the problem's constraints.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the valid move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or tile movements. The grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles, i.e., no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number (horizontal or vertical) to merge. \n\n### Checking Rows (Left\/Right Moves):\n- **Row 0**: [128, 64, 8, 64] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Row 1**: [4, 16, 2, 256] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Row 2**: [64, 8, 128, 8] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Row 3**: [8, 2, 16, 128] – No adjacent duplicates.\n\n### Checking Columns (Up\/Down Moves):\n- **Column 0**: [128, 4, 64, 8] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Column 1**: [64, 16, 8, 2] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Column 2**: [8, 2, 128, 16] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Column 3**: [64, 256, 8, 128] – No adjacent duplicates.\n\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles (horizontal or vertical) have the same number, there are no valid merges. However, the game ends after the 100th epoch, and the answer must be one of the four directions.

Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n128|64|8|64\n4|16|2|256\n64|8|128|8\n8|2|16|128\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The two adjacent 2s in row 3 (columns 0 and 1) will merge into a 4 (since they are the same value). After merging, row 3 becomes `[4, 0, 0, 0]`. This is a valid move that merges tiles and increases the score by 4. The merged 4 is placed in the bottom-left corner, which aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Swiping right shifts all tiles in row 3 to the right. The two 2s in row 3 (columns 0 and 1) will shift to columns 2 and 3, becoming adjacent. They merge into a 4, and row 3 becomes `[0, 0, 0, 4]`. This is also a valid move that merges tiles and increases the score by 4. The merged 4 is placed in the bottom-right corner, another corner.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Swiping up shifts tiles upward. The 2s in row 3 (columns 0 and 1) will move to row 0 (columns 0 and 1), resulting in row 0 becoming `[2, 2, 0, 0]`. However, no merging occurs because the 2s are in the same row (not column), and merging only happens for adjacent tiles in the direction of the swipe (vertical for UP\/DOWN). Thus, this move does not merge tiles and is less optimal.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Swiping down has no effect because the 2s are already in the bottom row (row 3). Tiles cannot move further down, so this is an invalid move.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT are valid moves that merge the 2s into a 4. However, LEFT places the merged 4 in the bottom-left corner, which is a strategic corner to prioritize for future merges. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to position tiles strategically to facilitate future merges, with a focus on keeping larger tiles (here, the 4) in a corner.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board has a 4 at (3,0) (bottom-left) and a 2 at (1,2). All other tiles are empty. We need to evaluate how each move shifts these tiles and sets up for future merges.\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros, remains unchanged.\n- **Row 1**: The 2 at (1,2) shifts left to (1,0) (since columns 0-1 are empty). Row 1 becomes `2|0|0|0`.\n- **Row 2**: All zeros, remains unchanged.\n- **Row 3**: The 4 at (3,0) is already left-aligned, so row 3 remains `4|0|0|0`.\n\nAfter moving LEFT, the 4 stays in the bottom-left corner (3,0), and the 2 moves to (1,0), aligning them vertically in column 0. This positions them to potentially merge with a new 2 in column 0 (e.g., a new 2 in (2,0) could allow merging 2s in column 0 with a subsequent UP move).\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros, remains unchanged.\n- **Row 1**: The 2 at (1,2) shifts right to (1,3). Row 1 becomes `0|0|0|2`.\n- **Row 2**: All zeros, remains unchanged.\n- **Row 3**: The 4 at (3,0) shifts right to (3,3). Row 3 becomes `0|0|0|4`.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT, the 4 moves to the bottom-right corner (3,3), and the 2 moves to (1,3). While this keeps the 4 in a corner, the 2 is now in column 3, which is less aligned with the 4 for future merges compared to the LEFT move.\n\n### UP Move:\n- **Column 0**: The 4 at (3,0) shifts up to (0,0). Column 0 becomes `4|0|0|0`.\n- **Column 2**: The 2 at (1,2) shifts up to (0,2). Column 2 becomes `2|0|0|0`.\n- Other columns remain unchanged.\n\nAfter moving UP, the 4 moves to the top-left corner (0,0), and the 2 moves to (0,2). While the 4 is in a corner, the 2 is now in row 0, which is less aligned with the 4 for vertical merges compared to the LEFT move.\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- **Column 0**: The 4 at (3,0) remains in place (already bottom-aligned). Column 0 remains `0|0|0|4`.\n- **Column 2**: The 2 at (1,2) shifts down to (3,2). Column 2 becomes `0|0|0|2`.\n- Other columns remain unchanged.\n\nAfter moving DOWN, the 4 stays in the bottom-left corner (3,0), and the 2 moves to (3,2). While the 4 is in a corner, the 2 is now in row 3, column 2, which is less aligned with the 4 for horizontal merges compared to the LEFT move.\n\n### Strategic Decision:\nThe LEFT move aligns the 2 (now at (1,0)) and 4 (at (3,0)) vertically in column 0, making it easier to merge with a new 2 in column 0 (e.g., a new 2 in (2,0) could merge 2s in column 0 with a subsequent UP move). This setup supports the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (4 in bottom-left) and positioning smaller tiles to facilitate future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategy of merging tiles and keeping larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 2|0|0|2\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 4|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 1: [2,0,0,2] → Tiles shift left, merging the two 2s into 4.

Tiles move but do not combine.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns shift downward. No merges occur (e.g., column 0 has [0,2,0,4] → [0,0,2,4]; column 3 has [0,2,0,0] → [0,0,0,2]).  \n   - No score from merging. Tiles move but do not combine.  \n\n### Strategy Consideration:\n- Merging tiles (LEFT\/RIGHT) is better than non-merging moves (UP\/DOWN) because they generate score and reduce tile count.  \n- Between LEFT and RIGHT, the RIGHT move positions the merged 4s in the right corner (column 3), aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners. This setup allows future merges (e.g., swiping UP could merge the two 4s in column 3 into an 8).  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 2: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT:\n- Tiles shift left, but no merges occur.  \n  - Row 1: [0,0,0,4] → [4,0,0,0]  \n  - Row 2: [2,0,0,0] → [2,0,0,0] (no change)  \n  - Row 3: [0,0,0,4] → [4,0,0,0]  \n  - Result: No merges, score = 0.  \n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- Tiles shift right, but no merges occur.  \n  - Row 2: [2,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,2]  \n  - Other rows remain unchanged.  \n  - Result: No merges, score = 0.  \n\n#### 3. UP:\n- Tiles shift upward. Columns are processed:  \n  - **Column 0**: [0,0,2,0] → [2,0,0,0] (2 moves to row 0).  \n  - **Column 3**: [0,4,0,4] → [4,4,0,0] (4s from rows 1 and 3 shift up to rows 0 and 1). These 4s merge into 8 (score += 8), resulting in [8,0,0,0].  \n  - Resulting board:  \n    Row 0: 2|0|0|8  \n    Rows 1-3: All zeros.  \n  - Score: 8.  \n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- Tiles shift downward. Columns are processed:  \n  - **Column 0**: [0,0,2,0] → [0,0,0,2] (2 moves to row 3).  \n  - **Column 3**: [0,4,0,4] → [0,0,4,4] (4s from rows 1 and 3 shift down to rows 2 and 3). These 4s merge into 8 (score += 8), resulting in [0,0,0,8].  \n  - Resulting board:  \n    Row 3: 2|0|0|8  \n    Rows 0-2: All zeros.  \n  - Score: 8.  \n\n\n### Decision:\nBoth UP and DOWN merge the 4s in column 3, yielding 8 points. However, strategic gameplay advises keeping larger tiles in corners. Swiping DOWN places the merged 8 in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), a common corner for building higher tiles. This aligns with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in a corner for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|4|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 2|0|0|8  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0 remains unchanged (all zeros).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,4,0] → 4 shifts left to [4,0,0,0].  \n   - Row 2 remains unchanged.  \n   - Row 3: [2,0,0,8] → 2 and 8 shift left to [2,8,0,0].  \n   Result: Tiles are scattered, with 4 in row 1 and 2\/8 in row 3. No merging occurs.  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0 remains unchanged.  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,4,0] → 4 shifts right to [0,0,0,4].  \n   - Row 2 remains unchanged.  \n   - Row 3: [2,0,0,8] → 2 shifts right to [0,0,2,8].  \n   Result: Tiles are shifted right, but still scattered (4 in row 1, 2\/8 in row 3). No merging occurs.  \n\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,0,0,2] → 2 shifts up to row 0 → [2,0,0,0].  \n   - Column 2: [0,4,0,0] → 4 shifts up to row 0 → [4,0,0,0].  \n   - Column 3: [0,0,0,8] → 8 shifts up to row 0 → [8,0,0,0].  \n   Result: Tiles consolidate to row 0 as [2,0,4,8]. No merging occurs, but tiles are in the top row.  \n\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,0,0,2] → 2 remains in row 3 (already at the bottom).  \n   - Column 2: [0,4,0,0] → 4 shifts down to row 3 → [0,0,0,4].  \n   - Column 3: [0,0,0,8] → 8 remains in row 3 (already at the bottom).  \n   Result: Tiles consolidate to row 3 as [2,0,4,8]. No merging occurs, but tiles are in the bottom row, aligned left-to-right.  \n\n\n### Strategy Consideration:  \nIn 2048, a key strategy is to consolidate larger tiles in a corner (e.g., bottom-right) to facilitate future merges. Swiping DOWN moves all existing tiles (2, 4, 8) to the bottom row, aligning them left-to-right (2, 0, 4, 8). This positions the largest tile (8) in the bottom-right corner, a strong position for building higher tiles. This consolidation is more strategic than other moves, which leave tiles scattered or in less optimal rows.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|4|0\nRow 3: 2|0|4|8\n```\nKey tiles: 4 (row 2, column 2), 2 (row 3, column 0), 4 (row 3, column 2), and 8 (row 3, column 3).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0 and 1 remain empty.  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,4,0] → shifts left to [4,0,0,0].  \n   - Row 3: [2,0,4,8] → shifts left to [2,4,8,0].  \n   - No merges occur. No score gain. Not optimal.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0 and 1 remain empty.  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,4,0] → shifts right to [0,0,0,4].  \n   - Row 3: [2,0,4,8] → shifts right to [0,2,4,8].  \n   - No merges occur. No score gain. Not optimal.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,0,0,2] → shifts up to [2,0,0,0].  \n   - Column 1: All zeros. No change.  \n   - Column 2: [0,0,4,4] → merges 4+4 into 8 (score +8), shifts up to [8,0,0,0].  \n   - Column 3: [0,0,0,8] → shifts up to [8,0,0,0].  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 2|0|8|8  \n     Rows 1-3: All zeros  \n     ```  \n   - Merges 4s in column 2, but large tiles (8s) end up in the top row.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,0,0,2] → already at the bottom (row 3). No change.  \n   - Column 1: All zeros. No change.  \n   - Column 2: [0,0,4,4] → merges 4+4 into 8 (score +8), shifts down to [0,0,0,8].  \n   - Column 3: [0,0,0,8] → already at the bottom (row 3). No change.  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     Rows 0-2: All zeros  \n     Row 3: 2|0|8|8  \n     ```  \n   - Merges 4s in column 2, and large tiles (8s) end up in the bottom row, which aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner (bottom-right).\n\n### Strategic Preference:\nMoving DOWN merges the 4s (score +8) and positions the resulting 8s in the bottom row, a corner-adjacent area. This setup is favorable for future merges (e.g., 8+8 into 16 with a right move) and keeps larger tiles in a stable corner.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|2|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 2|0|8|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:\n   - Row 0: `[0,2,0,0]` → shifts to `[2,0,0,0]` (no merge).\n   - Row 1: All zeros → unchanged.\n   - Row 2: All zeros → unchanged.\n   - Row 3: `[2,0,8,8]` → shifts left, merging the two `8`s into `16`. Result: `[2,16,0,0]` (score +16).\n   - Outcome: 16 is placed in (3,1), not a corner.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:\n   - Row 0: `[0,2,0,0]` → shifts right to `[0,0,0,2]` (no merge).\n   - Row 1: All zeros → unchanged.\n   - Row 2: All zeros → unchanged.\n   - Row 3: `[2,0,8,8]` → shifts right, merging the two `8`s into `16`. Result: `[0,0,2,16]` (score +16).\n   - Outcome: 16 is placed in (3,3), the bottom-right corner (a strategic corner for large tiles).\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:\n   - Columns shift upward, but no merges occur (all tiles are isolated in their columns). Result: No score gain.\n   - Outcome: Tiles cluster in the top row, with no merges, making it less optimal.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:\n   - Columns shift downward, but no merges occur (all tiles are isolated in their columns). Result: No score gain.\n   - Outcome: Tiles cluster in the bottom row, with no merges, making it less optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the `8`s into `16` (score +16), but RIGHT places the `16` in the bottom-right corner (a strategic corner), which is better for future moves. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to position tiles strategically (especially the largest tile, 16 in the bottom-right corner) and set up for future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 1: 0|0|4|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|2|16  \n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur.

The board becomes:  \n     Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 2: 0|0|4|2  \n     Row 3: 0|0|2|16  \n   - Tiles (4, 2, 2) are positioned in the bottom two rows, adjacent to the 16. This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner and clustering smaller tiles nearby for future merges (e.g., 2s or 4s could merge in subsequent moves).\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping **DOWN** moves tiles toward the bottom-right corner (where the 16 is located), setting up for potential future merges. This aligns with the strategic goal of clustering smaller tiles near larger ones to maximize scoring opportunities.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|4|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|4|2\nRow 3: 0|0|2|16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles shift left. Row 0 becomes `[4,0,0,0]`, Row 2 becomes `[4,2,0,0]`, Row 3 becomes `[2,16,0,0]`.  \n   - No merges occur. The 16 (largest tile) moves from column 3 to column 1 (row 3), leaving the corner.  \n   - Poor for preserving large tiles in corners.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles shift right. Row 0 becomes `[0,0,0,4]`, Row 2 remains `[0,0,4,2]`, Row 3 remains `[0,0,2,16]`.  \n   - No merges occur. The 16 stays in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), but no setup for future merges.  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down. Row 3 becomes `[0,4,2,16]` (16 stays in the bottom-right corner). Rows 0-2 remain mostly empty.  \n   - No merges occur. No meaningful setup for future merges.  \n\n4. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles shift up. Columns are processed:  \n     - Column 1 (originally `[4,0,0,0]`) shifts to `[4,0,0,0]`.  \n     - Column 2 (originally `[0,0,4,2]`) shifts to `[4,2,0,0]`.  \n     - Column 3 (originally `[0,0,2,16]`) shifts to `[2,16,0,0]`.  \n   - Resulting board after shifting:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 0|4|4|2  \n     Row 1: 0|0|2|16  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - **Key Benefit**: The 16 (largest tile) moves to row 1, column 3 (top-right corner), a strategic corner. Additionally, two 4s in row 0 (columns 1 and 2) are adjacent, setting up a potential merge with a subsequent LEFT move (which would merge them into 8, scoring points).  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving UP positions the largest tile (16) in a corner and sets up adjacent 4s in row 0 for a future merge. This aligns with strategic goals of preserving large tiles and enabling merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential, tile positioning, and strategic goals (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|4|4|2\nRow 1: 2|0|2|16\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two `4`s merge into `8`, and the `2` shifts left. Result: `8|2|0|0`. Score: +8.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left. The two `2`s merge into `4`, and the `16` shifts left. Result: `4|16|0|0`. Score: +4.\n- **Rows 2-3**: No change (all zeros).  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 4+4 and 2+2, total score +12. The `16` moves to row 1, column 1 (not a corner).\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two `4`s merge into `8`, and the `2` stays rightmost. Result: `0|0|8|2`. Score: +8.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right. The two `2`s merge into `4`, and the `16` stays rightmost. Result: `0|0|4|16`. Score: +4.\n- **Rows 2-3**: No change (all zeros).  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 4+4 and 2+2, total score +12. The `16` remains in row 1, column 3 (right corner), which is strategic for keeping large tiles in corners.\n\n### UP Move:\n- Columns shift up. No merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in columns). Result: Tiles shift up but remain unmerged. No score gain.  \n- **Outcome**: No merges, poor for score and positioning.\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- Columns shift down. No merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in columns). Result: Tiles shift down but remain unmerged. No score gain.  \n- **Outcome**: No merges, poor for score and positioning.\n\n### Key Strategy:\nThe `16` is critical to preserve in a corner for future merges. Swiping RIGHT keeps `16` in the right corner (row 1, column 3), while LEFT moves it to a non-corner position. Both LEFT and RIGHT merge tiles, but RIGHT optimizes tile positioning.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to position tiles for future merges and maximize scoring opportunities.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|8|2  \nRow 1: 0|0|4|16  \nRow 2: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n```\n\n### LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,8,2] → shifts to [8,2,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,4,16] → shifts to [4,16,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [8,0,0,0] → remains [8,0,0,0] (no change).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,0,0,0] → no change.  \n- **Result**: Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. Larger tiles (8, 16) are not positioned for future merges.  \n\n\n### RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,8,2] → no change (tiles already right-aligned).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,4,16] → no change (tiles already right-aligned).  \n- **Row 2**: [8,0,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,8] (8 moves to column 3).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,0,0,0] → no change.  \n- **Result**: Only the 8 in Row 2 moves right, but no merges occur. Larger tiles (16, 8) are spread out.  \n\n\n### DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: [0,0,8,0] → 8 shifts to Row 3, Column 0 → [0,0,0,8].  \n- **Column 2**: [8,4,0,0] → 8 shifts to Row 2, Column 2; 4 shifts to Row 3, Column 2 → [0,0,8,4].  \n- **Column 3**: [2,16,0,0] → 2 shifts to Row 2, Column 3; 16 shifts to Row 3, Column 3 → [0,0,2,16].  \n- **Result**: Tiles shift down, but no merges occur. The 16 is moved to the bottom-right corner (good), but no immediate merge potential.  \n\n\n### UP Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: [0,0,8,0] → 8 shifts to Row 0, Column 0 → [8,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 2**: [8,4,0,0] → 8 remains in Row 0, Column 2; 4 remains in Row 1, Column 2 → [8,4,0,0].  \n- **Column 3**: [2,16,0,0] → 2 remains in Row 0, Column 3; 16 remains in Row 1, Column 3 → [2,16,0,0].  \n- **Result**: After shifting up, Row 0 becomes [8,0,8,2]. This positions two 8s in Row 0 (columns 0 and 2) with a single empty space (column 1) between them.  \n\n### Strategic Advantage of UP Swipe:\nThe UP move strategically positions two 8s in the same row (Row 0). In subsequent moves (e.g., a LEFT swipe), these 8s can shift into adjacent positions and merge into a 16, generating score. This setup aligns with the goal of merging smaller tiles to form larger ones, a key strategy for maximizing scores.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize score, maintain larger tiles in corners, and set up future merges.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|8|2\nRow 1: 0|0|4|16\nRow 2: 0|0|8|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\nKey observations: The largest tile is 16 in Row 1, Column 3 (bottom-right corner). Merging tiles and keeping large tiles in corners is critical.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### **UP**:\n- Columns are processed upward. Most columns have no adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to shift into. Tiles remain in place, making UP an invalid move (no meaningful change).\n\n#### **DOWN**:\n- Columns are processed downward. Tiles shift to the bottom, but no adjacent equal tiles merge (e.g., Column 2: [8,4,8,0] shifts to [0,8,4,8] with no merges). No score is gained, and the 16 in the bottom-right corner is not optimized.\n\n#### **LEFT**:\n- Rows are processed leftward:\n  - Row 0: [8,0,8,2] → merges 8 and 8 into 16 (score +16), resulting in [16,2,0,0].\n  - Row 1: [0,0,4,16] → shifts to [4,16,0,0] (no merge).\n  - Row 2: [0,0,8,0] → shifts to [8,0,0,0] (no merge).\n- Result: 16 moves from Row 1, Column 3 (corner) to Row 1, Column 1 (non-corner), weakening the corner strategy.\n\n#### **RIGHT**:\n- Rows are processed rightward:\n  - Row 0: [8,0,8,2] → merges 8 and 8 into 16 (score +16), resulting in [0,0,16,2].\n  - Row 1: [0,0,4,16] → remains [0,0,4,16] (no merge, 16 stays in Row 1, Column 3, the bottom-right corner).\n  - Row 2: [0,0,8,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,8] (8 moves to Row 2, Column 3, adjacent to the 16 in the corner).\n- Result: The 16 remains in the bottom-right corner, and the 8 moves to an adjacent position (Row 2, Column 3), setting up potential future merges (e.g., a new 8 in Row 3, Column 3 could merge with the existing 8 in Row 2, Column 3).\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT is optimal because it merges the 8s in Row 0 (gaining 16 points), keeps the largest tile (16) in the bottom-right corner, and positions the 8 in an adjacent corner column, supporting future merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score through merges and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|16|2\nRow 1: 0|0|4|16\nRow 2: 0|0|0|8\nRow 3: 0|0|4|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \nTiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). Result:  \nRow 0: 16|2|0|0  \nRow 1: 4|16|0|0  \nRow 2: 8|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 4|0|0|0  \n*No score gain.*\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nTiles shift right, but no merges occur (adjacent tiles are distinct).

In Column 2 (values: 16, 4, 0, 4), the two 4s merge into 8 (score +8). Result:  \nRow 0: 0|0|16|2  \nRow 1: 0|0|8|16  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n*Score gain: 8.*\n\n#### **DOWN**  \nTiles shift down, merging vertically. In Column 2 (values: 16, 4, 0, 4), the two 4s merge into 8 (score +8). Additionally, Row 3 after shifting becomes [0|0|8|8], setting up a potential merge of 8s in the next move (e.g., a RIGHT swipe would merge them into 16). Result:  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|16|2  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 3: 0|0|8|8  \n*Score gain: 8. Strategic advantage: 8s in Row 3 can merge next.*\n\n### Conclusion:  \nBoth UP and DOWN yield an 8-point merge, but DOWN positions the 8s in Row 3, creating a future merge opportunity (RIGHT swipe to merge 8s into 16). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners and setting up future merges.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|4|0|2\nRow 2: 0|0|16|16\nRow 3: 0|0|8|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **UP**:  \n   Swiping up shifts tiles upward. Columns are processed, but no adjacent equal tiles exist to merge. The board remains mostly unchanged with no score gain.  \n   **Result**: No merges, score = 0.\n\n2. **DOWN**:  \n   Swiping down shifts tiles downward. Columns are processed, but no adjacent equal tiles exist to merge. The board remains mostly unchanged with no score gain.  \n   **Result**: No merges, score = 0.\n\n3. **LEFT**:  \n   Swiping left shifts tiles to the left in each row:  \n   - Row 0: No change (all zeros).  \n   - Row 1: [0,4,0,2] → [4,2,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,16,16] → [16,16,0,0] → merge into 32 → [32,0,0,0] (score +32).  \n   - Row 3: [0,0,8,8] → [8,8,0,0] → merge into 16 → [16,0,0,0] (score +16).  \n   **Total Score**: 32 + 16 = 48.  \n   **New Board**:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 4|2|0|0  \n   Row 2: 32|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 16|0|0|0  \n   ```\n\n4. **RIGHT**:  \n   Swiping right shifts tiles to the right in each row:  \n   - Row 0: No change (all zeros).  \n   - Row 1: [0,4,0,2] → [0,0,4,2] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,16,16] → [0,0,16,16] → merge into 32 → [0,0,0,32] (score +32).  \n   - Row 3: [0,0,8,8] → [0,0,8,8] → merge into 16 → [0,0,0,16] (score +16).  \n   **Total Score**: 32 + 16 = 48.  \n   **New Board**:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 0|0|4|2  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|32  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|16  \n   ```\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT yield the same score (48). However, the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (e.g., bottom-right) is key for future merges. Swiping RIGHT places the largest merged tile (32) in the bottom-right area (row 2, column 3) and the next largest (16) directly below it (row 3, column 3), aligning them toward the bottom-right corner. This setup is more favorable for building a \"snake-like\" structure to merge larger tiles in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals of merging tiles and positioning larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|8|4|2\nRow 2: 0|0|0|32\nRow 3: 0|0|0|16\n```\nKey tiles: 8, 4, 2 (row 1), 32 (row 2, column 3), 16 (row 3, column 3). Larger tiles (32, 16) are in the right column (column 3), rows 2 and 3.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **RIGHT**:  \n   All tiles in rows 1-3 are already shifted as far right as possible (no empty spaces to the right of non-zero tiles). This move does not change the board and is not a valid move (no tiles shift).\n\n2. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 1: [0,8,4,2] shifts left to [8,4,2,0].  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,0,32] shifts left to [32,0,0,0].  \n   - Row 3: [0,0,0,16] shifts left to [16,0,0,0].  \n   Result: Larger tiles (32, 16) move to the left column (column 0), breaking the right-column grouping. This reduces alignment with the \"keep larger tiles in a corner\" strategy.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 1: [0,8,0,0] shifts up to [8,0,0,0].  \n   - Column 2: [0,4,0,0] shifts up to [4,0,0,0].  \n   - Column 3: [0,2,32,16] shifts up to [2,32,16,0].  \n   Result: Tiles 8, 4, 2 move to row 0, while 32 and 16 remain in column 3 (rows 1 and 2). This scatters smaller tiles upward, reducing potential for future merges in the critical right column.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 1: [0,8,0,0] shifts down to [0,0,0,8].  \n   - Column 2: [0,4,0,0] shifts down to [0,0,0,4].  \n   - Column 3: [0,2,32,16] remains (no space to shift further down).  \n   Result: Tiles 8 and 4 move to row 3 (bottom row), aligning with 16 (row 3, column 3). Larger tiles (32, 16) stay in the right column (column 3), rows 2 and 3. This positions smaller tiles (8, 4) in the bottom row, adjacent to the larger 16, creating opportunities for future merges (e.g., 4 + 4 → 8, 8 + 8 → 16, etc.).\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving **DOWN** keeps larger tiles (32, 16) in the right column (a corner) and positions smaller tiles (8, 4) in the bottom row, aligning with strategic goals of grouping tiles for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to position tiles for future merges, particularly focusing on larger tiles (32, 16s) to maximize scoring opportunities.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 16 | 0  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 2  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 32  \nRow 3: 0 | 8 | 4 | 16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. The board becomes:  \n   Row 0: [16, 0, 0, 0], Row 1: [2, 0, 0, 0], Row 2: [32, 0, 0, 0], Row 3: [8, 4, 16, 0].  \n   No merges, and larger tiles (32, 16s) are spread across columns with no clear path for future merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right. The 16 in Row 0, Column 2 moves to Row 0, Column 3. Other tiles remain in place (since they are already right-aligned). The board becomes:  \n   Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 16], Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 2], Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 32], Row 3: [0, 8, 4, 16].  \n   This groups the 16s in Column 3 (Row 0 and Row 3), with 2 (Row 1) and 32 (Row 2) between them. This positions the 16s vertically, creating a potential future merge if a subsequent down swipe aligns them.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up. The 8 (Row 3, Column 1) moves to Row 0, Column 1; 16 (Row 0, Column 2) stays; 4 (Row 3, Column 2) moves to Row 1, Column 2; 2 (Row 1, Column 3) moves to Row 0, Column 3; 32 (Row 2, Column 3) moves to Row 1, Column 3; 16 (Row 3, Column 3) moves to Row 2, Column 3. The board becomes:  \n   Row 0: [0, 8, 16, 2], Row 1: [0, 0, 4, 32], Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 16], Row 3: [0, 0, 0, 0].  \n   Larger tiles (8, 16, 32) are spread across rows with no clear path for immediate or future merges.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down. The 16 (Row 0, Column 2) moves to Row 2, Column 2. Other tiles remain in place (since they are already bottom-aligned). The board becomes:  \n   Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 0], Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 2], Row 2: [0, 0, 16, 32], Row 3: [0, 8, 4, 16].  \n   Larger tiles (16, 32, 8) are spread across columns with no clear path for merges.\n\n### Key Insight:  \nSwiping **RIGHT** groups the two 16s vertically in Column 3 (Row 0 and Row 3). This positions them to potentially merge in a subsequent down swipe, where the 16 in Row 0, Column 3 would shift down past 2 (Row 1, Column 3) and 32 (Row 2, Column 3) to align with the 16 in Row 3, Column 3, creating a 32 tile and increasing the score. This strategic positioning of larger tiles in a column supports future merges, making RIGHT the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic positioning of tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 2: 0|16|0|32  \nRow 3: 0|8|4|16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Each row shifts tiles to the left.  \n   - Row 0: `[0,0,0,16]` → `[16,0,0,0]` (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: `[0,0,0,2]` → `[2,0,0,0]` (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: `[0,16,0,32]` → `[16,32,0,0]` (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: `[0,8,4,16]` → `[8,4,16,0]` (no merge).  \n   - Result: Tiles are consolidated to the left, aligning 16s in Row 0 (Column 0) and Row 2 (Column 0), which could merge in future moves. Larger tiles (32, 16) are positioned on the left, supporting a corner strategy.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Each row shifts tiles to the right.  \n   - Row 0: `[0,0,0,16]` (no change).  \n   - Row 1: `[0,0,0,2]` (no change).  \n   - Row 2: `[0,16,0,32]` → `[0,0,16,32]` (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: `[0,8,4,16]` (no change).  \n   - Result: No merges, and tiles are spread out, reducing future merge potential.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns shift tiles upward.  \n   - Column 0: All zeros (no change).  \n   - Column 1: `[0,0,16,8]` → `[16,8,0,0]` (no merge).  \n   - Column 2: `[0,0,0,4]` → `[4,0,0,0]` (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: `[16,2,32,16]` (no change, no merge).  \n   - Result: Tiles are spread vertically, with 16s in Row 0 (Column 1) and Row 3 (Column 3), limiting future merge opportunities.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns shift tiles downward.  \n   - Column 0: All zeros (no change).  \n   - Column 1: `[0,0,16,8]` (no change).  \n   - Column 2: `[0,0,0,4]` (no change).  \n   - Column 3: `[16,2,32,16]` (no change, no merge).  \n   - Result: No merges, and tiles remain in their original positions, providing no strategic advantage.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nNone of the moves result in immediate merges. However, **LEFT** consolidates tiles to the left, aligning 16s in Column 0 (Rows 0 and 2) and positioning larger tiles (32, 16) on the left. This supports a corner strategy, increasing future merge potential.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to merge tiles, increase the score, and position larger tiles in a corner for future merges.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 16|0|0|0\nRow 1: 2|4|0|0\nRow 2: 16|32|0|0\nRow 3: 8|4|16|0\n```\nKey observations:\n- No adjacent tiles of the same number exist, so no immediate merges are possible.\n- Empty tiles (0s) are concentrated on the right side of the grid.\n- Larger tiles (16, 32) are spread across the left and middle columns.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all non-zero tiles are already left-aligned with no adjacent duplicates). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain. Larger tiles stay on the left but are not positioned in a corner.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, moving all non-zero tiles to the rightmost possible positions. This clusters larger tiles (16, 32) along the right edge:  \n   - Row 0: 0|0|0|16 (16 in the top-right corner).  \n   - Row 1: 0|0|2|4 (smaller tiles on the right).  \n   - Row 2: 0|0|16|32 (16 and 32 on the right).  \n   - Row 3: 0|8|4|16 (8, 4, 16 on the right).  \n   This positions larger tiles in the right corner, aligning with the strategy of cornering large tiles for future merges.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up, but no merges occur (columns have no adjacent duplicates). The board remains scattered, with larger tiles (16, 32) spread across rows 0–3. No clear benefit for future merges.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down, but no merges occur (columns have no adjacent duplicates). Larger tiles remain spread across the grid, with no strategic cornering.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping **RIGHT** moves larger tiles (16, 32) to the right edge, positioning them in the top-right and bottom-right corners. This setup facilitates future merges by clustering tiles along a corner, which is critical for long-term strategy.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize merging opportunities and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 1: 16|0|2|4  \nRow 2: 0|0|16|32  \nRow 3: 0|8|4|16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT**  \nWhen swiping left, tiles in each row shift to the leftmost possible positions.  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,0,16] → [16,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [16,0,2,4] → [16,2,4,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,16,32] → [16,32,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,8,4,16] → [8,4,16,0] (no merge).  \n\nAfter swiping left, the board becomes:  \n```\nRow 0: 16|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 16|2|4|0  \nRow 2: 16|32|0|0  \nRow 3: 8|4|16|0  \n```  \nNotably, three 16s align vertically in Column 0 (Rows 0, 1, 2). This positions them for potential merging in subsequent moves (e.g., swiping up next could merge the top two 16s into a 32).\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nSwiping right shifts tiles to the rightmost positions.  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,0,16] → [0,0,0,16] (no change).  \n- **Row 1**: [16,0,2,4] → [0,16,2,4] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,16,32] → [0,0,16,32] (no change).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,8,4,16] → [0,8,4,16] (no change).  \n\nNo merges occur, and tiles remain scattered, offering no clear path for future merges.\n\n#### **UP**  \nSwiping up shifts tiles to the top of each column.  \n- **Column 0**: [0,16,0,0] → [16,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,8] → [8,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,2,16,4] → [2,16,4,0] (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [16,4,32,16] → [16,4,32,16] (no merge).  \n\nNo merges occur, and larger tiles (e.g., 32 in Row 2, Column 3) remain isolated.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \nSwiping down shifts tiles to the bottom of each column.  \n- **Column 0**: [0,16,0,0] → [0,0,0,16] (no merge).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,8] → [0,0,0,8] (no change).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,2,16,4] → [0,2,16,4] (no merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [16,4,32,16] → [16,4,32,16] (no merge).  \n\nNo merges occur, and tiles are spread out without strategic grouping.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nSwiping **LEFT** aligns three 16s vertically in Column 0, creating a future opportunity to merge them (e.g., by swiping up next). This move strategically positions tiles for higher-scoring merges, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the given 4x4 grid. The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up future merging opportunities.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|0|0|0\nRow 1: 16|2|4|0\nRow 2: 16|32|4|0\nRow 3: 8|4|16|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT**  \nShifting tiles left would not merge any tiles, as no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nShifting tiles right also fails to merge any tiles, as no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. Tiles shift to the right, but no score is gained.  \n\n#### **UP**  \nProcessing columns top-to-bottom:  \n- **Column 0**: [16, 16, 16, 8] → Merges the first two 16s into 32 (score +32). Remaining tiles shift up to [32, 16, 8, 0].  \n- **Column 1**: [0, 2, 32, 4] → No merges (all tiles are distinct). Shifts to [2, 32, 4, 0].  \n- **Column 2**: [0, 4, 4, 16] → Merges the two 4s into 8 (score +8).

Remaining tiles shift down to [0, 16, 32, 8].  \n- **Column 1**: [0, 2, 32, 4] → No merges (all tiles are distinct). Shifts to [0, 2, 32, 4].  \n- **Column 2**: [0, 4, 4, 16] → Merges the two 4s (row1 and row2) into 8 (score +8).

Swiping LEFT in the next move would merge these 32s into 64, providing a significant score boost. This strategic advantage makes DOWN the better choice.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 16|2|0|0\nRow 2: 32|32|8|0\nRow 3: 8|4|16|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles cannot move down because the bottom row (Row 3) is full, and no tiles in upper rows can shift into empty spaces below. No valid merges or movements occur. **DOWN is invalid**.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward, but no vertical merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in columns). The resulting board has no merged tiles, so no score gain. **UP provides no immediate benefit**.\n\n3. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 1 (16|2|0|0) shifts right to 0|0|16|2 (no merge).  \n   - Row 2 (32|32|8|0) shifts right: 32 and 32 merge into 64 (score +64), resulting in 0|0|8|64.  \n   - Row 3 (8|4|16|8) remains unchanged (no merges).  \n   The 64 tile ends up in the rightmost column (corner), but empty spaces are left in the left columns.\n\n4. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 1 (16|2|0|0) remains 16|2|0|0 (no merge).  \n   - Row 2 (32|32|8|0) shifts left: 32 and 32 merge into 64 (score +64), resulting in 64|8|0|0.  \n   - Row 3 (8|4|16|8) remains unchanged (no merges).  \n   The 64 tile ends up in the leftmost column (corner), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners. This positions larger tiles (64, 16) in the left, creating potential for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is optimal because it merges the 32s into a 64 tile in the left corner, aligning with strategic goals of consolidating large tiles in corners.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (e.g., consolidating tiles, setting up future merges, and keeping larger tiles in a corner). The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|32\nRow 1: 16|2|0|0\nRow 2: 64|8|0|0\nRow 3: 8|4|16|8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. Row 0 becomes `[32,0,0,0]`, Row 1 remains `[16,2,0,0]`, Row 2 remains `[64,8,0,0]`, and Row 3 remains `[8,4,16,8]`. This leaves empty spaces on the right, but no meaningful consolidation of larger tiles.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur. Row 0 remains `[0,0,0,32]`, Row 1 becomes `[0,0,16,2]`, Row 2 becomes `[0,0,64,8]`, and Row 3 remains `[8,4,16,8]`. This shifts smaller tiles to the right but does not meaningfully group larger tiles.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward, consolidating non-zero tiles toward the top. Columns are processed as follows:  \n   - Column 0: `[0,16,64,8]` → `[16,64,8,0]` (non-zero tiles stack upward).  \n   - Column 1: `[0,2,8,4]` → `[2,8,4,0]`.  \n   - Column 2: `[0,0,0,16]` → `[16,0,0,0]`.  \n   - Column 3: `[32,0,0,8]` → `[32,8,0,0]`.  \n\n   The resulting board after UP is:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 16|2|16|32  \n   Row 1: 64|8|0|8  \n   Row 2: 8|4|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   This consolidates larger tiles (16, 32, 64) in the top two rows, leaving empty spaces in the bottom row. This setup aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (top row) and creates potential for future merges (e.g., 16s in Row 0 could merge if the 2 between them is moved).\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward, but no merges occur. Columns remain largely unchanged, with minimal consolidation. For example, Column 0 remains `[0,16,64,8]`, Column 1 remains `[0,2,8,4]`, Column 2 remains `[0,0,0,16]`, and Column 3 becomes `[0,0,32,8]`. This does not meaningfully group tiles or set up future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe UP move consolidates larger tiles (16, 32, 64) in the top rows, aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner, and creates opportunities for future merges. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 16 | 2 | 16 | 32  \nRow 1: 64 | 8 | 0 | 8  \nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 8 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles (16, 2, 16, 32) have no adjacent duplicates, so no merges. Tiles shift left but remain in place.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (64, 8, 0, 8) shift left to (64, 8, 8, 0). The two 8s merge into 16, resulting in (64, 16, 0, 0). Score +16.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (8, 4, 8, 0) shift left but no adjacent duplicates, so no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: No tiles, remains unchanged.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles (16, 2, 16, 32) have no adjacent duplicates, so no merges. Tiles shift right but remain in place.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (64, 8, 0, 8) shift right to (64, 0, 8, 8). The two 8s merge into 16, resulting in (64, 0, 0, 16). Score +16.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (8, 4, 8, 0) shift right to (0, 8, 4, 8). No adjacent duplicates, so no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: No tiles, remains unchanged.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed upward, but no columns have adjacent duplicates. Tiles shift up but no merges occur.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed downward, but no columns have adjacent duplicates. Tiles shift down but no merges occur.  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\n- Only LEFT and RIGHT result in merges (row 1’s 8s merging into 16, +16 score).  \n- **Strategy**: Larger tiles (64 in row 1, column 0; 32 in row 0, column 3) are already in corners. Moving RIGHT positions the merged 16 in row 1, column 3, adjacent to the 32 in row 0, column 3. This aligns with the strategy of building toward larger tiles in corners, as future merges in column 3 (e.g., 16 + 16 → 32, then 32 + 32 → 64) are more likely.  \n\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

The largest tile (64) remains in Row 1, Column 2 (not a corner), and smaller tiles are scattered. No strategic advantage.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up, but no merges occur. The 64 stays in Row 1, Column 2 (not a corner), and the 32 remains in Row 0, Column 3 (top-right corner). However, the 64 is not positioned in a corner, limiting future merging potential.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down, but no merges occur. The 64 moves to Row 2, Column 2 (not a corner), and smaller tiles spread across lower rows. This disrupts the current structure without strategic benefit.\n\n4. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left. Row 1 (originally `0|0|64|16`) becomes `64|16|0|0`, moving the largest tile (64) to Row 1, Column 0 (top-left corner), a strategic corner position. Row 0 remains unchanged (`16|2|16|32`), keeping the 32 in Row 0, Column 3 (top-right corner). Row 2 (`2|8|4|8`) stays the same. This positions large tiles in corners and clusters smaller tiles for potential future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT strategically positions the largest tile (64) in the top-left corner and maintains the 32 in the top-right corner, creating a structure favorable for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, potential merges, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|2|16|32\nRow 1: 64|16|0|0\nRow 2: 2|8|4|8\nRow 3: 0|0|2|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 3 (0|0|2|0) shifts left to 2|0|0|0. Other rows have no empty spaces to shift into, so they remain unchanged.  \n   - No merges occur.  \n   - Larger tiles (64, 32, 16s) stay in their positions, but no strategic advantage is gained.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 1 (64|16|0|0) shifts right to 0|0|64|16. Row 3 (0|0|2|0) shifts right to 0|0|0|2. Other rows remain unchanged.  \n   - No merges occur.  \n   - The 64 tile moves from row 1, column 0 to row 1, column 2, which is not a corner, reducing strategic positioning.  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles shift down, but no merges occur. The 64 tile moves from row 1, column 0 to row 2, column 0 (middle left), and the 32 tile moves from row 0, column 3 to row 1, column 3 (middle right).  \n   - Larger tiles are no longer in corners, which is suboptimal for future merges.  \n\n4. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom. Tiles shift up, filling empty spaces.  \n   - Row 1 becomes 64|16|4|8 (no merges), row 2 becomes 2|8|2|0, and row 3 becomes all zeros (0|0|0|0).  \n   - Larger tiles (64 in row 1, column 0; 32 in row 0, column 3) remain in or near corners, maintaining strategic positioning.  \n   - Row 3 being empty provides flexibility for spawning new tiles, which can be moved up to merge with existing tiles (e.g., a new 2 in row 3, column 0 could merge with the 2 in row 2, column 0 when swiped up).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move because it preserves the position of larger tiles in corners, creates an empty row (row 3) for future tile spawning, and maintains strategic flexibility for merging smaller tiles.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes on the given 4x4 grid:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16|2|16|32  \nRow 1: 64|16|4|8  \nRow 2: 2|8|2|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|8  \n\n\n### **LEFT Move**  \nTiles shift left, but no merges occur because no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. The board remains mostly unchanged, with only Row 3 shifting 8 to the leftmost position.  \n**Result**: No merges, score = 0.  \n\n\n### **RIGHT Move**  \nTiles shift right, but again, no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. Row 2 shifts tiles right (0|2|8|2), but no merges.  \n**Result**: No merges, score = 0.  \n\n\n### **UP Move**  \nTiles shift upward, and we check columns for merges:  \n- **Column 3**: [32, 8, 0, 8]. When shifting up, the 8 from Row 3 moves to Row 2, creating adjacent 8s in Rows 1 and 2. These merge into 16, adding 16 to the score.  \nOther columns have no merges.  \n\n**Result After UP**:  \nRow 0: 16|2|16|32  \nRow 1: 64|16|4|16  \nRow 2: 2|8|2|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n**Score**: 16.  \n\n\n### **DOWN Move**  \nTiles shift downward, and we check columns for merges:  \n- **Column 3**: [32, 8, 0, 8]. When shifting down, the 8 from Row 1 moves to Row 2, creating adjacent 8s in Rows 2 and 3. These merge into 16, adding 16 to the score.  \n\n**Result After DOWN**:  \nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 16|2|16|32  \nRow 2: 64|16|4|16  \nRow 3: 2|8|2|0  \n**Score**: 16.  \n\n\n### **Comparison**  \nBoth UP and DOWN yield a merge (8+8=16, score=16). However, UP leaves larger tiles (64 in Row 1, Column 0; 32 in Row 0, Column 3) in corners, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners. DOWN moves large tiles to lower rows, which may limit future merges. Thus, UP is more strategic.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate their impact on the game board, focusing on merges, score gains, and future flexibility.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 16 | 2 | 16 | 32  \nRow 1: 64 | 16 | 4 | 16  \nRow 2: 2 | 8 | 2 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 2 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [16, 2, 16, 32] has no adjacent duplicates or empty spaces to shift, so no change.  \n- **Row 1**: [64, 16, 4, 16] has no adjacent duplicates, so no change.  \n- **Row 2**: [2, 8, 2, 0] shifts left but no merges (tiles remain [2, 8, 2, 0]).  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 2, 0] shifts left to [2, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Result**: No merges, minimal tile movement. Poor for scoring.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [16, 2, 16, 32] has no adjacent duplicates or empty spaces to shift, so no change.  \n- **Row 1**: [64, 16, 4, 16] has no adjacent duplicates, so no change.  \n- **Row 2**: [2, 8, 2, 0] shifts right to [0, 2, 8, 2]. No merges.  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 2, 0] shifts right to [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n- **Result**: No merges, minimal tile movement. Poor for scoring.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [16, 64, 2, 0] shifts up (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [2, 16, 8, 0] shifts up (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [16, 4, 2, 2] shifts up. The two 2s (row 2 and 3) merge into 4 (row 2), row 3 becomes 0. Score +4.  \n- **Column 3**: [32, 16, 0, 0] shifts up (no merges).  \n- **Result**: Merges 2s in column 2, score +4. Row 3 becomes entirely empty, preserving flexibility for future moves.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [16, 64, 2, 0] shifts down to [0, 16, 64, 2] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [2, 16, 8, 0] shifts down to [0, 2, 16, 8] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [16, 4, 2, 2] shifts down. The two 2s (row 2 and 3) merge into 4 (row 3), row 2 becomes 0. Score +4.  \n- **Column 3**: [32, 16, 0, 0] shifts down to [0, 0, 32, 16] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: Merges 2s in column 2, score +4. Row 3 fills with tiles, reducing future flexibility.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nBoth UP and DOWN merge the 2s in column 2, but UP leaves row 3 empty, which is critical for maintaining flexibility and spawning new tiles. This makes UP the better choice.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging opportunities:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16|2|16|32  \nRow 1: 64|16|4|16  \nRow 2: 2|8|4|0  \nRow 3: 32|0|0|0  \n\n\n### **LEFT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: All tiles are already left-aligned; no merges or shifts.  \n- **Row 1**: All tiles are left-aligned; no merges or shifts.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [2,8,4] are left-aligned (no zeros to shift into).  \n- **Row 3**: 32 is already left-aligned.  \n**Result**: No merges, score = 0.  \n\n\n### **RIGHT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles [16,2,16,32] are right-aligned; no merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [64,16,4,16] are right-aligned; no merges.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [2,8,4] shift right to [0,2,8,4].  \n- **Row 3**: 32 shifts right to [0,0,0,32].  \n**Result**: No merges, score = 0.  \n\n\n### **UP Move**:\n- **Column 0**: [16,64,2,32] (all distinct, no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [2,16,8,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [16,4,4,0]. The two 4s in rows 1 and 2 merge into 8 (score += 8). After merging, the column becomes [16,8,0,0].  \n- **Column 3**: [32,16,0,0] (no merges).  \n**Result**: Merges 4+4→8 (score = 8). Larger tiles (64, 32, 16) remain in top-left\/top-right corners, preserving strategic positioning.  \n\n\n### **DOWN Move**:\n- **Column 0**: [16,64,2,32] (all distinct, no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [2,16,8,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [16,4,4,0]. Reversed column [0,4,4,16] merges 4+4→8 (score += 8), resulting in [0,0,16,8].  \n- **Column 3**: [32,16,0,0]. Reversed column [0,0,16,32] shifts right, resulting in [0,0,16,32].  \n**Result**: Merges 4+4→8 (score = 8), but larger tiles (32) are pushed to the bottom row, disrupting corner positioning.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and DOWN yield a score of 8, but UP preserves larger tiles in top corners (e.g., 64 in row 1, column 0; 32 in row 0, column 3), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners. UP is thus the better move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16 | 2 | 16 | 32  \nRow 1: 64 | 16 | 8 | 16  \nRow 2: 2 | 8 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 32 | 32 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [16, 2, 16, 32] shift left with no merges (no adjacent equal numbers).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [64, 16, 8, 16] shift left with no merges.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [2, 8, 0, 0] shift left with no changes.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [32, 32, 0, 0] shift left, merging the two 32s into 64. Score increases by 64. Resulting row: [64, 0, 0, 0].  \n\nAfter LEFT, the merged 64 in row 3, column 0 aligns with the existing 64 in row 1, column 0 (same column), supporting future merges. Larger tiles consolidate on the left, a strategic corner.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [16, 2, 16, 32] shift right with no merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [64, 16, 8, 16] shift right with no merges.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [2, 8, 0, 0] shift right to [0, 0, 2, 8] with no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [32, 32, 0, 0] shift right, merging the two 32s into 64. Resulting row: [0, 0, 0, 64].  \n\nWhile RIGHT also merges the 32s, the merged 64 ends up in row 3, column 3 (bottom-right corner). This isolates it from other large tiles (e.g., 64 in row 1, column 0), reducing future merge potential.\n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed top to bottom. No adjacent equal tiles in any column (e.g., column 0: [16, 64, 2, 32]; column 1: [2, 16, 8, 32]; etc.). No merges occur, and tiles remain largely unchanged.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed bottom to top. No adjacent equal tiles in any column (e.g., column 0: [16, 64, 2, 32]; column 1: [2, 16, 8, 32]; etc.). No merges occur, and tiles remain largely unchanged.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the 32s in row 3 into 64, but LEFT consolidates the merged 64 in the left corner (row 3, column 0), aligning with the existing 64 in row 1, column 0. This structure supports future merges and follows the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on valid moves and strategic positioning. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 16|2|16|32  \nRow 1: 64|16|8|16  \nRow 2: 2|8|0|0  \nRow 3: 64|4|0|0  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Valid Moves**: A valid move requires either adjacent tiles to merge or tiles to shift into empty spaces. Currently, there are no adjacent tiles with the same value, so valid moves depend on tiles shifting into empty spaces (zeros in Row 2 and Row 3, Columns 2-3).\n- **Invalid Moves**: \n  - **LEFT**: All non-zero tiles in Rows 0 and 1 are already left-aligned, and Rows 2 and 3 have no room to shift left further. No movement occurs.\n  - **UP**: All non-zero tiles in Columns 0 and 1 are already top-aligned, and Columns 2 and 3 have no room to shift up further. No movement occurs.\n- **Valid Moves**:\n  - **RIGHT**: Tiles in Rows 2 and 3 (2, 8, 64, 4) can shift right into empty Columns 2-3. This results in:\n    ```\n    Row 0: 16|2|16|32  \n    Row 1: 64|16|8|16  \n    Row 2: 0|0|2|8  \n    Row 3: 0|0|64|4  \n    ```\n  - **DOWN**: Tiles in Columns 2 and 3 (16, 8, 32, 16) can shift down into empty Rows 2-3. This results in:\n    ```\n    Row 0: 16|2|0|0  \n    Row 1: 64|16|0|0  \n    Row 2: 2|8|16|32  \n    Row 3: 64|4|8|16  \n    ```\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe goal is to keep larger tiles in a corner for future merges. The largest tiles are 64 (left column) and 32 (right column). Swiping **DOWN** moves the 32 (originally in Row 0, Column 3) to Row 2, Column 3, aligning it with smaller tiles (16, 8) in the bottom-right area. This positions larger tiles toward the bottom, which can facilitate future merges as smaller tiles shift into place. Swiping **RIGHT** keeps 32 in the top-right but leaves less strategic alignment for merging. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 2 | 0 | 2\nRow 1: 64 | 16 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 2 | 8 | 16 | 32\nRow 3: 64 | 4 | 8 | 16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1. **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [16, 2, 0, 2] → Non-zero tiles shift left: [16, 2, 2]. The two 2s merge into 4, resulting in [16, 4, 0, 0]. Score: +4.\n- **Row 1**: [64, 16, 0, 0] → Non-zero tiles shift left (no merges): [64, 16, 0, 0].\n- **Row 2**: [2, 8, 16, 32] → All non-zero, no merges.\n- **Row 3**: [64, 4, 8, 16] → All non-zero, no merges.\n- **Outcome**: Merges 2s in Row 0, keeping larger tiles (e.g., 16, 64) in the left column (a corner), aligning with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in corners.\n\n#### 2. **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [16, 2, 0, 2] → Non-zero tiles shift right: [0, 16, 2, 2]. The two 2s merge into 4, resulting in [0, 16, 4, 0]. Score: +4.\n- **Row 1**: [64, 16, 0, 0] → Non-zero tiles shift right (no merges): [0, 0, 64, 16].\n- **Row 2**: [2, 8, 16, 32] → All non-zero, no merges.\n- **Row 3**: [64, 4, 8, 16] → All non-zero, no merges.\n- **Outcome**: Merges 2s in Row 0 but moves the 16 in Row 0 to column 1, reducing corner concentration of large tiles.\n\n#### 3. **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed, but no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. Tiles shift up but no merges occur. No score gain.\n- **Outcome**: No merges, minimal benefit.\n\n#### 4. **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed, but no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. Tiles shift down but no merges occur. No score gain.\n- **Outcome**: No merges, minimal benefit.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT swipe merges the 2s in Row 0, gains a small score, and keeps larger tiles (16, 64) in the left column (a corner), which is strategically optimal.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 4 | 0 | 0\nRow 1: 64 | 16 | 0 | 32\nRow 2: 2 | 8 | 16 | 32\nRow 3: 64 | 4 | 8 | 16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- All rows have no adjacent equal tiles to merge. Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. This move does not improve the board or score.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- All rows have no adjacent equal tiles to merge. Tiles shift right, but no merges occur. This move also does not improve the board or score.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 3** (vertical) has tiles `[0, 32, 32, 16]`. When swiping up, the two `32` tiles (rows 1 and 2 of column 3) merge into `64` (score +64). The merged `64` moves to row 0 of column 3 (top-right corner, a strategic corner for large tiles). Other columns have no merges but shift up. This move creates a merge and positions a large tile in a corner.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 3** (vertical) has tiles `[0, 32, 32, 16]`. When swiping down, the two `32` tiles (rows 1 and 2 of column 3) merge into `64` (score +64). However, the merged `64` moves to row 2 of column 3, which is not a corner. This move creates a merge but does not optimize tile positioning as effectively as UP.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP swipe merges two `32` tiles into `64` (score +64) and positions the `64` in the top-right corner, a strategic location for future merges. Other directions (LEFT, RIGHT) do not create merges, and DOWN does not optimize tile positioning as well.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN), focusing on merging opportunities, tile movement, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 4 | 16 | 64  \nRow 1: 64 | 16 | 8 | 16  \nRow 2: 2 | 8 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 64 | 4 | 0 | 2  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### 1. Swipe LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: All tiles are non-zero and already left-aligned. No movement.  \n- **Row 1**: All tiles are non-zero and left-aligned. No movement.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `2` and `8` are already left-aligned. No movement.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `64`, `4`, and `2` shift left into empty spaces. Row 3 becomes `64 | 4 | 2 | 0` (the `2` moves from column 3 to column 2, filling the empty space).  \n\nNo merges occur, but row 3 gains an empty tile at column 3, grouping empty spaces in the bottom-right corner (rows 2 and 3, columns 2-3). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles (e.g., 64s in column 0) in a corner while consolidating empty spaces elsewhere.\n\n#### 2. Swipe RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: All tiles are non-zero and right-aligned. No movement.  \n- **Row 1**: All tiles are non-zero and right-aligned. No movement.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `2` and `8` shift right into empty spaces. Row 2 becomes `0 | 0 | 2 | 8`.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles are already right-aligned (no movement).  \n\nNo merges occur, but row 2 gains empty tiles at columns 0-1. This scatters empty spaces, making it harder to consolidate larger tiles.\n\n#### 3. Swipe UP:\n- **Column 0**: All tiles are non-zero and top-aligned. No movement.  \n- **Column 1**: All tiles are non-zero and top-aligned. No movement.  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles `16` and `8` are already top-aligned. No movement.  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles `64`, `16`, and `2` shift up into empty spaces. Column 3 becomes `64 | 16 | 2 | 0`.  \n\nNo merges occur, and empty spaces remain scattered (row 3, column 3). This does not meaningfully consolidate tiles or empty spaces.\n\n#### 4. Swipe DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: All tiles are non-zero and bottom-aligned. No movement.  \n- **Column 1**: All tiles are non-zero and bottom-aligned. No movement.  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles `16` and `8` shift down into empty spaces. Column 2 becomes `0 | 0 | 16 | 8`.  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles are already bottom-aligned (no movement).  \n\nNo merges occur, and empty spaces are scattered (rows 0-1, column 2). This does not improve tile consolidation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwipping LEFT consolidates empty spaces in the bottom-right corner (rows 2-3, columns 2-3) while leaving larger tiles (64s in column 0) undisturbed. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and creating space for future merges. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and simulate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. The goal is to identify moves that create opportunities for merging tiles (to increase scores) while avoiding filling the grid without valid moves.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|4|16|64  \nRow 1: 64|16|8|16  \nRow 2: 2|8|0|0  \nRow 3: 64|4|2|4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- All rows are already filled with non-zero tiles (no empty spaces to shift into). No tiles move, and no merges occur. **Not a valid move** (no tiles shift or merge).\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Row 2 (originally `2|8|0|0`) shifts right to `0|0|2|8`, but no other rows have empty spaces to shift into. No merges occur. While valid (tiles move), it does not create new adjacent pairs for future merges.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are pushed upward, but most columns are already filled with non-zero tiles. Columns 2 and 3 (with empty spaces) shift tiles up, but no merges occur. No new adjacent pairs are created for future merges.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are pushed downward. Key changes occur in Columns 2 and 3 (with empty spaces):\n  - **Column 2** (originally `16|8|0|2`) shifts down to `0|16|8|2`.\n  - **Column 3** (originally `64|16|0|4`) shifts down to `0|64|16|4`.\n- After the shift, **Row 1** becomes `64|16|16|64` (two adjacent `16`s in columns 1 and 2), and **Row 2** becomes `2|8|8|16` (two adjacent `8`s in columns 1 and 2). These adjacent pairs set up opportunities for merging in subsequent moves (e.g., swiping LEFT to merge the `16`s and `8`s).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN swipe creates new adjacent pairs of equal tiles, enabling future merges and strategic score growth.

No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, so no merges occur.  \n- **Total Score**: 0.  \n\n\n### Key Considerations:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 48 points, but LEFT is preferable because it consolidates larger tiles (e.g., `64`s in Row 1 and Row 3) toward the left edge, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 16 | 4 | 16 | 0  \nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 64 | 32  \nRow 2: 2 | 16 | 16 | 0  \nRow 3: 64 | 4 | 2 | 4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [16, 4, 16, 0] shift left but no merges (16, 4, 16 are not adjacent).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [64, 32, 64, 32] shift left but no merges (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [2, 16, 16, 0] shift left. The two 16s merge into 32, resulting in [2, 32, 0, 0]. Score gain: 32.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [64, 4, 2, 4] shift left but no merges.  \n\n**Result**: Row 2 merges 16s into 32 (32 points). No setup for future large merges.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [16, 4, 16, 0] shift right to [0, 16, 4, 16]. No merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [64, 32, 64, 32] shift right but no merges.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [2, 16, 16, 0] shift right to [0, 2, 0, 32]. The two 16s merge into 32. Score gain: 32.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [64, 4, 2, 4] shift right but no merges.  \n\n**Result**: Row 2 merges 16s into 32 (32 points). Additionally, row 2, column 0 becomes empty (0), creating space for 64s in column 0 (row 1 and row 3) to potentially merge in future moves.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed upward. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges.  \n**Result**: No score gain.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed downward. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges.  \n**Result**: No score gain.  \n\n\n### Key Insight:  \nBoth LEFT and RIGHT yield a 32-point merge in row 2. However, RIGHT leaves row 2, column 0 empty. This empty space allows the 64 in row 3, column 0 to shift upward into row 2, column 0 in future moves, making it adjacent to the 64 in row 1, column 0. This sets up a potential merge of two 64s into 128, a critical strategic advantage.  \n\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

Result: [16, 64, 4, 0].  \n\n**Total Score Gain**: 4 + 64 = 68.  \n**Post-Move Setup**: Row 1 becomes [16, 32, 64, 64], with adjacent 64s that can merge in future left swipes. Larger tiles (e.g., 64 in row 0, column 0) are positioned in the top-left corner, a strategic corner for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \nTiles shift downward, merging equal tiles in columns:  \n- **Column 0**: [0, 64, 16, 64] → Shifts to [0, 64, 16, 64] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [16, 32, 0, 4] → Shifts to [0, 16, 32, 4] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [4, 64, 2, 2] → Shifts and merges 2+2=4 (score +4).

After RIGHT, the 128 (largest merged tile) is placed in the rightmost column (row 1, column 3), aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners. This positions the 128 to potentially merge with future tiles if they shift right, while empty spaces (left columns) allow flexibility for new tiles to be directed toward the corner.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up for future merges.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 16 | 4 | 16\nRow 1: 0 | 16 | 32 | 128\nRow 2: 0 | 64 | 4 | 8\nRow 3: 16 | 0 | 0 | 4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- All rows shift left, but no adjacent tiles merge. Score gain: 0.  \n- Result: No meaningful changes; no strategic advantage.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- All rows shift right, but no adjacent tiles merge. Score gain: 0.  \n- Result: No meaningful changes; no strategic advantage.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- Columns shift upward. Only column 1 (values: 16, 16, 64, 0) has a merge: 16 + 16 = 32. Score gain: 32.  \n- Result: Larger tiles (64, 32, 128) cluster in the top rows, but future merges are limited.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- Columns shift downward. Column 1 (values: 16, 16, 64, 0) merges 16 + 16 = 32. Score gain: 32.  \n- Post-DOWN board:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 16  \n  Row 1: 0 | 0 | 4 | 128  \n  Row 2: 64 | 32 | 32 | 8  \n  Row 3: 16 | 64 | 4 | 4  \n  ```  \n- **Strategic Advantage**: Row 2 has adjacent 32s (columns 1 and 2), and row 3 has adjacent 4s (columns 2 and 3). A subsequent LEFT swipe would merge these pairs (32+32=64 and 4+4=8), yielding 72 additional points. This sets up stronger future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhile UP and DOWN both yield 32 points immediately, DOWN provides better long-term potential for future merges (e.g., via a LEFT swipe afterward). Thus, DOWN is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities, tile positioning, and strategic goals (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 8 | 0 | 16\nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 4 | 128\nRow 2: 64 | 32 | 32 | 8\nRow 3: 16 | 64 | 4 | 4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: [0, 8, 0, 16] → Shifts to [8, 16, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 4, 128] → Shifts to [4, 128, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [64, 32, 32, 8] → Merges 32s into 64 → [64, 64, 8, 0] (score +64).  \n- **Row 3**: [16, 64, 4, 4] → Merges 4s into 8 → [16, 64, 8, 0] (score +8).  \n- **Result**: 128 (largest tile) moves to row 1, column 1 (center), which is suboptimal.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: [0, 8, 0, 16] → Shifts to [0, 0, 8, 16] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 4, 128] → Shifts to [0, 0, 4, 128] (no merge; 128 stays in row 1, column 3, a corner-adjacent position).  \n- **Row 2**: [64, 32, 32, 8] → Merges 32s into 64 → [0, 64, 64, 8] (score +64).  \n- **Row 3**: [16, 64, 4, 4] → Merges 4s into 8 → [16, 64, 0, 8] (score +8).  \n- **Result**: 128 remains in row 1, column 3 (corner-adjacent), and 64s in row 2, columns 1-2 are adjacent (potential for future merging).  \n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- Columns are processed top to bottom. No merges occur because no adjacent tiles in columns are equal. Score remains 0.  \n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- Columns are processed bottom to top. Only 4s in row 3, column 2-3 merge into 8 (score +8). 128 moves down to row 2, column 3 (worse positioning).  \n\n### Strategic Considerations:  \n- **Largest Tile (128)**: RIGHT keeps 128 in row 1, column 3 (corner-adjacent), while LEFT moves it to the center.  \n- **Merging Potential**: RIGHT creates adjacent 64s in row 2, columns 1-2 (can merge into 128 in a subsequent move).  \n- **Corner Tiles**: RIGHT places 16 in row 0, column 3 (top-right corner) and 8 in row 3, column 3 (bottom-right corner), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, score gain, and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|8|16\nRow 1: 2|0|4|128\nRow 2: 0|64|64|8\nRow 3: 0|16|64|8\n```\nKey observations:\n- The largest tile is 128 at (1,3).\n- There are two 64s in row 2 (columns 1 and 2) and two 64s in row 3 (column 2) and row 2 (column 2).\n- Two 8s in row 2 (column 3) and row 3 (column 3) can merge.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### LEFT:\n- Row 0: [0,0,8,16] → [8,16,0,0] (no merges).\n- Row 1: [2,0,4,128] → [2,4,128,0] (no merges).\n- Row 2: [0,64,64,8] → [128,8,0,0] (64+64=128, score +128).\n- Row 3: [0,16,64,8] → [16,64,8,0] (no merges).\n- **Total score gain: 128**.

New board has 256 in Row 3, Column 2.  \n\n### Conclusion  \nThe **LEFT** swipe provides the highest immediate score (256 + 8 = 264) by merging two pairs of tiles (128s and 4s). It also positions the new 256 tile in a strategic location (Row 2, Column 0), avoiding clutter and maintaining flexibility for future moves. Other moves (right, up, down) either yield no merges or fewer merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize tile merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 1: 8|16|0|0  \nRow 2: 128|4|128|4  \nRow 3: 2|16|128|16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,0,0,16] → shifts to [16,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: [8,16,0,0] → shifts to [8,16,0,0] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [128,4,128,4] → no merges (tiles are not adjacent after shifting).  \n   - Row 3: [2,16,128,16] → no merges (tiles are already left-aligned).  \n   **Result**: No merges, minimal tile movement.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,0,0,16] → no change (16 is already right-aligned).  \n   - Row 1: [8,16,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,8,16] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [128,4,128,4] → no merges (tiles are not adjacent after shifting).  \n   - Row 3: [2,16,128,16] → no merges (tiles are already right-aligned).  \n   **Result**: No merges, minimal tile movement.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,8,128,2] → shifts to [8,128,2,0] (no merge).  \n   - Column 1: [0,16,4,16] → shifts to [16,4,16,0] (no merge).  \n   - Column 2: [0,0,128,128] → 128s merge into 256 (row 0, column 2).  \n   - Column 3: [16,0,4,16] → shifts to [16,4,16,0] (no merge).  \n   **Result**: Merges two 128s into 256, but 256 is placed in the top-middle (row 0, column 2).\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,8,128,2] → no change (tiles are already bottom-aligned).  \n   - Column 1: [0,16,4,16] → no change (tiles are already bottom-aligned).  \n   - Column 2: [0,0,128,128] → 128s merge into 256 (row 3, column 2).  \n   - Column 3: [16,0,4,16] → shifts to [0,16,4,16] (no merge).  \n   **Result**: Merges two 128s into 256, with 256 placed in the bottom-middle (row 3, column 2), adjacent to the bottom-right corner.\n\n### Key Consideration:\nStrategically, larger tiles should be kept in corners. The DOWN swipe places the merged 256 in the bottom row (closer to the bottom-right corner), which is more favorable for future merges and tile alignment. UP places 256 in the top row, which is less optimal.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN, focusing on tile merges and score gains.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 16 | 0 | 0\nRow 1: 8 | 16 | 0 | 16\nRow 2: 128 | 4 | 0 | 4\nRow 3: 2 | 16 | 256 | 16\n```\n\n### LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [0,16,0,0] → shifts to [16,0,0,0] (no merge).\n- **Row 1**: [8,16,0,16] → shifts to [8,16,16,0], merging the two 16s into 32 → [8,32,0,0] (score +32).\n- **Row 2**: [128,4,0,4] → shifts to [128,4,4,0], merging the two 4s into 8 → [128,8,0,0] (score +8).\n- **Row 3**: [2,16,256,16] → no merges (all tiles are distinct).\n- **Total Score Gain**: 32 + 8 = 40.\n\n### RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [0,16,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,16] (no merge).\n- **Row 1**: [8,16,0,16] → shifts to [0,8,0,32] (merging 16s into 32, score +32).\n- **Row 2**: [128,4,0,4] → shifts to [0,128,0,8] (merging 4s into 8, score +8).\n- **Row 3**: [2,16,256,16] → shifts to [0,2,256,32] (merging 16s into 32, score +32).\n- **Total Score Gain**: 32 + 8 + 32 = 72.\n\n### UP Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: [0,8,128,2] → shifts to [8,128,2,0] (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [16,16,4,16] → shifts to [32,4,16,0] (merging 16s into 32, score +32).\n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,256] → shifts to [256,0,0,0] (no merge).\n- **Column 3**: [0,16,4,16] → shifts to [16,4,16,0] (no merges).\n- **Total Score Gain**: 32.\n\n### DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: [0,8,128,2] → shifts to [0,8,128,2] (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [16,16,4,16] → shifts to [0,32,4,16] (merging 16s into 32, score +32).\n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,256] → shifts to [0,0,0,256] (no merge).\n- **Column 3**: [0,16,4,16] → shifts to [0,16,4,16] (no merges).\n- **Total Score Gain**: 32.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe RIGHT swipe results in the highest score gain (72) due to three merges (two 16s in Row 1, two 4s in Row 2, and two 16s in Row 3). Additionally, larger tiles like 256 remain in a stable position (Row 3, Column 2), which aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to create opportunities for merging tiles (to increase the score) and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 16  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 8 | 32  \nRow 2: 0 | 2 | 128 | 8  \nRow 3: 2 | 16 | 256 | 16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 16 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n     Row 1: 8 | 32 | 0 | 0  \n     Row 2: 2 | 128 | 8 | 0  \n     Row 3: 2 | 16 | 256 | 16  \n     ```  \n   - No immediate merges, and no obvious setup for future merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n   - Resulting board remains nearly unchanged, with no new merge opportunities.  \n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift down, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n   - Resulting board remains nearly unchanged, with no new merge opportunities.  \n\n4. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift up. Columns are processed from top to bottom:  \n     - Column 0: `[0, 0, 0, 2]` → `[2, 0, 0, 0]` (2 moves to row 0).  \n     - Column 1: `[0, 0, 2, 16]` → `[2, 16, 0, 0]` (2 moves to row 0, 16 to row 1).  \n     - Column 2: `[0, 8, 128, 256]` → `[8, 128, 256, 0]` (8 to row 0, 128 to row 1, 256 to row 2).  \n     - Column 3: `[16, 32, 8, 16]` → `[16, 32, 8, 16]` (no shifts, no merges).  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     Row 0: 2 | 2 | 8 | 16  \n     Row 1: 0 | 16 | 128 | 32  \n     Row 2: 0 | 0 | 256 | 8  \n     Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 16  \n     ```  \n   - **Key Insight**: Row 0 now has two adjacent 2s (`[2, 2, 8, 16]`). This sets up a merge opportunity for the next move (e.g., swiping LEFT would merge the 2s into a 4, earning 4 points).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe creates an immediate merge opportunity in the next move by placing two 2s adjacent to each other in Row 0. This is the most strategic move to maximize future scoring potential.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN based on potential merges, tile consolidation, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 2 | 8 | 16  \nRow 1: 0 | 16 | 128 | 32  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 0 | 32 | 0 | 16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \nWhen swiping left, tiles shift to the left edge of each row, with merges prioritized from left to right:  \n- **Row 0**: [2, 2, 8, 16] → The two 2s merge into 4.

No merge.  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 32, 0, 16] → Tiles shift left. Result: [32, 16, 0, 0]. No merge.  \n\n**Outcome**: The 256 (largest tile) moves to the left edge (row 2, column 0), consolidating larger tiles on the left. Merges occur, and empty spaces are created on the right for future moves.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nWhen swiping right, tiles shift to the right edge of each row, with merges prioritized from right to left:  \n- **Row 0**: [2, 2, 8, 16] → The two 2s merge into 4.

No merge.  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 32, 0, 16] → Tiles shift right. Result: [0, 0, 32, 16]. No merge.  \n\n**Outcome**: Merges occur, but larger tiles (e.g., 256, 128) remain scattered, with less consolidation in a corner.  \n\n#### **UP**  \nWhen swiping up, tiles shift to the top of each column, with merges prioritized from top to bottom:  \n- **Column 0**: [2, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift up. Result: [2, 0, 0, 0]. No merge.  \n- **Column 1**: [2, 16, 0, 32] → Tiles shift up. Result: [2, 16, 32, 0]. No merge.  \n- **Column 2**: [8, 128, 256, 0] → Tiles shift up. Result: [8, 128, 256, 0]. No merge.  \n- **Column 3**: [16, 32, 8, 16] → Tiles shift up. Result: [16, 32, 8, 16]. No merge.  \n\n**Outcome**: No merges occur, and tiles remain spread out with minimal consolidation.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \nWhen swiping down, tiles shift to the bottom of each column, with merges prioritized from bottom to top:  \n- **Column 0**: [2, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift down. Result: [0, 0, 0, 2]. No merge.  \n- **Column 1**: [2, 16, 0, 32] → Tiles shift down. Result: [0, 2, 16, 32]. No merge.  \n- **Column 2**: [8, 128, 256, 0] → Tiles shift down. Result: [0, 8, 128, 256]. No merge.  \n- **Column 3**: [16, 32, 8, 16] → Tiles shift down. Result: [16, 32, 8, 16]. No merge.  \n\n**Outcome**: No merges occur, and tiles remain scattered with no strategic consolidation.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT is the best move. It consolidates larger tiles (e.g., 256) to the left edge (a corner), creates merges (2+2=4 for immediate score), and generates empty spaces on the right for future moves.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile alignment, and strategic placement of larger tiles. The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities while keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 8 | 16 | 0\nRow 1: 16 | 128 | 32 | 0\nRow 2: 256 | 8 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 32 | 16 | 0 | 4\n```\nKey observations:\n- Larger tiles (256, 128, 32, 16) are spread across the grid, with the largest tile (256) in row 2, column 0 (a corner).\n- Empty spaces (0s) are present in all rows, ensuring all directions are valid moves.\n- No immediate merges are possible in any direction, so the focus is on positioning tiles to enable future merges.\n\n### Direction Evaluation:\n#### 1. LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [4, 8, 16, 0] → Tiles shift left (no merges), remains [4, 8, 16, 0].\n- **Row 1**: [16, 128, 32, 0] → Tiles shift left (no merges), remains [16, 128, 32, 0].\n- **Row 2**: [256, 8, 0, 0] → Tiles shift left (no merges), remains [256, 8, 0, 0].\n- **Row 3**: [32, 16, 0, 4] → Tiles shift left to [32, 16, 4, 0] (no merges).\n\n**Outcome**: Tiles shift left, keeping larger tiles (256, 128) in the left half of the grid. This aligns with the strategy of concentrating larger tiles in a corner (256 remains in row 2, column 0).\n\n#### 2. RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [4, 8, 16, 0] → Tiles shift right to [0, 4, 8, 16] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [16, 128, 32, 0] → Tiles shift right to [0, 16, 128, 32] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [256, 8, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right to [0, 0, 256, 8] (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: [32, 16, 0, 4] → Tiles shift right to [0, 32, 16, 4] (no merges).\n\n**Outcome**: Larger tiles (256, 128, 16) spread to the right, reducing concentration in a corner. Less strategic for future merges.\n\n#### 3. UP Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: [4, 16, 256, 32] → No merges, remains [4, 16, 256, 32].\n- **Column 1**: [8, 128, 8, 16] → No merges, remains [8, 128, 8, 16].\n- **Column 2**: [16, 32, 0, 0] → Tiles shift up to [16, 32, 0, 0] (no merges).\n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 0, 4] → Tiles shift up to [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).\n\n**Outcome**: Minimal tile movement; 256 remains in row 2, column 0, but no meaningful alignment for future merges.\n\n#### 4. DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: [4, 16, 256, 32] → No merges, remains [4, 16, 256, 32].\n- **Column 1**: [8, 128, 8, 16] → No merges, remains [8, 128, 8, 16].\n- **Column 2**: [16, 32, 0, 0] → Tiles shift down to [0, 0, 16, 32] (no merges).\n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 0, 4] → No movement, remains [0, 0, 0, 4].\n\n**Outcome**: Tiles shift down, but larger tiles (256, 128) are not meaningfully aligned, and empty spaces are scattered.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe best aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles (e.g., 256) in a corner and concentrating tiles to enable future merges. Other directions either spread tiles or fail to improve positioning. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities, tile positioning, and future setup. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 8 | 16 | 4\nRow 1: 16 | 128 | 32 | 0\nRow 2: 256 | 8 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 32 | 16 | 4 | 0\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Larger Tiles**: The largest tiles are 256 (row 2, column 0), 128 (row 1, column 1), and 32 (row 1, column 2; row 3, column 0). Strategic play involves keeping large tiles in corners and setting up merges for smaller tiles.\n- **Empty Spaces**: There are 4 empty tiles (row 1, column 3; row 2, columns 2-3; row 3, column 3). A valid move shifts tiles into these spaces, potentially creating merges.\n- **Merge Opportunities**: The goal is to create adjacent tiles of the same value to merge them, increasing the score.\n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- All rows are already filled with non-zero tiles (except row 1, column 3; row 2, columns 2-3; row 3, column 3). No tiles can merge or shift left. No score gain, and no meaningful setup for future merges.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). The 256 (row 2, column 0) would move to column 2, disrupting the corner positioning of large tiles. Poor setup for future moves.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed top to bottom. Tiles shift up, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in columns are distinct). The 4 in row 3, column 2 moves up to row 2, column 2, but no immediate or obvious future merges are set up.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed bottom to top. Tiles shift down, creating critical merges and setup:\n  - **Column 2**: 16 (row 0), 32 (row 1), 0 (row 2), 4 (row 3) → Shifts down to [0, 16, 32, 4].\n  - **Column 3**: 4 (row 0), 0 (row 1), 0 (row 2), 0 (row 3) → Shifts down to [0, 0, 0, 4].\n  - **Row 3**: After shifting, row 3 becomes [32, 16, 4, 4]. This creates adjacent 4s in row 3, columns 2-3, which can merge into 8 with a subsequent LEFT swipe, generating score and improving tile alignment.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN swipe creates adjacent 4s in row 3, setting up a merge opportunity for the next move. This aligns with strategic goals of positioning tiles for future merges while preserving the corner placement of large tiles (e.g., 256 remains in row 2, column 0).\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 4|8|0|2\nRow 1: 16|128|16|0\nRow 2: 256|8|32|0\nRow 3: 32|16|4|4\n```\nKey observations:  \n- The largest tiles (256, 128) are on the left side of the grid, which is strategic for future merges.  \n- Row 3 has adjacent 4s (columns 2 and 3) that can merge if shifted left or right.  \n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [4,8,0,2] shift left → [4,8,2,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [16,128,16,0] shift left → [16,128,16,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [256,8,32,0] shift left → [256,8,32,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [32,16,4,4] shift left → [32,16,8,0] (4+4=8 merge, score +8).  \n\nResult: Merges 4s in Row 3, retains large tiles (256, 128) on the left, and keeps the grid organized for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles [4,8,0,2] shift right → [0,4,8,2] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [16,128,16,0] shift right → [0,16,128,16] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [256,8,32,0] shift right → [0,256,8,32] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [32,16,4,4] shift right → [0,32,16,8] (4+4=8 merge, score +8).  \n\nResult: Merges 4s in Row 3 but moves large tiles (256, 128) away from the left edge, reducing strategic positioning.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed vertically, but no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. No merges occur, and tiles remain in their current positions.  \n\nResult: No merges, no score, and no improvement in tile positioning.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed vertically, but no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. No merges occur, and tiles remain in their current positions.  \n\nResult: No merges, no score, and no improvement in tile positioning.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe LEFT move is optimal. It merges the 4s in Row 3 (gaining 8 points) while preserving the strategic placement of large tiles (256, 128) on the left edge, which is critical for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities and keep larger tiles in strategic positions.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|8|2|0\nRow 1: 16|128|16|0\nRow 2: 256|8|32|0\nRow 3: 32|16|8|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows are already left-aligned with no gaps between non-zero tiles. No merges occur, and the board remains unchanged. This provides no immediate or future benefits.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles in rows 0–2 shift right to fill the empty column (column 3). For example, row 0 becomes `0|4|8|2`, row 1 becomes `0|16|128|16`, and row 2 becomes `0|256|8|32`. Row 3 remains unchanged. No merges occur, and larger tiles (e.g., 256, 128) are moved away from the left edge, reducing corner consolidation.  \n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Columns are already bottom-aligned with no gaps between non-zero tiles. No tiles shift or merge. The board remains unchanged, offering no strategic advantage.  \n\n4. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - The only empty spaces are in column 3 (rows 0–2). Swiping up shifts the `2` in row 3, column 3 upward to row 0, column 3. This results in row 0 becoming `4|8|2|2` (two adjacent `2`s in columns 2 and 3). While no immediate merge occurs, this sets up a future merge opportunity: swiping left in the next move would merge the two `2`s into a `4`, generating score and freeing space.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe is optimal because it positions two `2`s adjacently in row 0, creating a future merge opportunity. This aligns with strategic goals of setting up merges and maintaining larger tiles (e.g., 256 in row 2, column 0) in a corner.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and the goal of maximizing score and strategic tile placement.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|8|2|2  \nRow 1: 16|128|16|4  \nRow 2: 256|8|32|0  \nRow 3: 32|16|8|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [4,8,2,2] → The two adjacent 2s merge into 4. New row: [4,8,4,0]. Score +4.  \n- **Row 1**: [16,128,16,4] → No adjacent equal tiles. Tiles shift left but remain [16,128,16,4].  \n- **Row 2**: [256,8,32,0] → Tiles shift left (no merging). New row: [256,8,32,0].  \n- **Row 3**: [32,16,8,0] → Tiles shift left (no merging). New row: [32,16,8,0].  \n\n**Outcome**: Merges 2s in Row 0, keeps large tiles (e.g., 256) in the corner (Row 2, Column 0), and maintains strategic positioning.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [4,8,2,2] → The two 2s merge into 4 (shifted right). New row: [0,4,8,4]. Score +4.  \n- **Row 1**: [16,128,16,4] → No adjacent equal tiles. Tiles shift right but remain [16,128,16,4].  \n- **Row 2**: [256,8,32,0] → Tiles shift right. New row: [0,256,8,32].  \n- **Row 3**: [32,16,8,0] → Tiles shift right. New row: [0,32,16,8].  \n\n**Outcome**: Merges 2s in Row 0 but moves large tiles (e.g., 256) away from the corner (Row 2, Column 1), which is suboptimal for strategic placement.\n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Columns**: All columns have distinct values (e.g., Column 0: [4,16,256,32]; Column 1: [8,128,8,16]). No merges occur, and tiles remain in place.  \n\n**Outcome**: No score gain and no strategic improvement.\n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Columns**: All columns have distinct values (e.g., Column 0: [4,16,256,32]; Column 1: [8,128,8,16]). No merges occur, and tiles remain in place.  \n\n**Outcome**: No score gain and no strategic improvement.\n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nLEFT is the best move. It merges the 2s in Row 0 for a score gain, preserves the 256 tile in the corner (Row 2, Column 0), and maintains better strategic positioning for future moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate merging opportunities, score gain, and tile positioning.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|8|4|0  \nRow 1: 16|128|16|4  \nRow 2: 256|8|32|32  \nRow 3: 32|16|8|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [4, 8, 4, 0] → Shifts left, no merges (tiles are distinct).  \n- **Row 1**: [16, 128, 16, 4] → Shifts left, no merges (tiles are distinct).  \n- **Row 2**: [256, 8, 32, 32] → The two 32s merge into 64. New row: [256, 8, 64, 0]. Score gain: 64.  \n- **Row 3**: [32, 16, 8, 0] → Shifts left, no merges (tiles are distinct).  \n\nResult: Merges 32+32=64, score +64. Larger tiles (256, 128) remain in corners or edges.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [4, 8, 4, 0] → Shifts right, no merges (tiles are distinct). New row: [0, 4, 8, 4].  \n- **Row 1**: [16, 128, 16, 4] → Shifts right, no merges (tiles are distinct).  \n- **Row 2**: [256, 8, 32, 32] → The two 32s merge into 64. New row: [256, 8, 0, 64]. Score gain: 64.  \n- **Row 3**: [32, 16, 8, 0] → Shifts right, no merges (tiles are distinct). New row: [0, 32, 16, 8].  \n\nResult: Merges 32+32=64, score +64. However, larger tiles (256, 128) are spread out, less optimal for corner strategy.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [4, 16, 256, 32] → Shifts up, no merges (tiles are distinct).  \n- **Column 1**: [8, 128, 8, 16] → The two 8s merge into 16. New column: [16, 128, 16, 0]. Score gain: 16.  \n- **Column 2**: [4, 16, 32, 8] → Shifts up, no merges (tiles are distinct).  \n- **Column 3**: [0, 4, 32, 0] → Shifts up, no merges (tiles are distinct). New column: [4, 32, 0, 0].  \n\nResult: Merges 8+8=16, score +16. Smaller score gain compared to LEFT\/RIGHT.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [4, 16, 256, 32] → Shifts down, no merges (tiles are distinct).  \n- **Column 1**: [8, 128, 8, 16] → Shifts down, no merges (tiles are distinct).  \n- **Column 2**: [4, 16, 32, 8] → Shifts down, no merges (tiles are distinct).  \n- **Column 3**: [0, 4, 32, 0] → Shifts down, no merges (tiles are distinct). New column: [0, 0, 32, 4].  \n\nResult: No merges, score +0.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nLEFT and RIGHT both merge 32+32=64 (score +64), but LEFT keeps the 256 in the corner (row 2, column 0), aligning with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in corners. UP and DOWN are less optimal due to lower or no score gain.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, tile arrangement, and future opportunities.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|8|4|0\nRow 1: 16|128|16|4\nRow 2: 256|8|64|0\nRow 3: 32|16|8|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: [4,8,4,0] → Shifts left but no merges (4,8,4,0).  \n- Row 1: [16,128,16,4] → No merges (16,128,16,4).  \n- Row 2: [256,8,64,0] → Shifts left but no merges (256,8,64,0).  \n- Row 3: [32,16,8,2] → No merges (32,16,8,2).  \n- **Result**: No merges, no strategic improvement.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: [4,8,4,0] → Shifts right to [0,4,8,4] (no merges).  \n- Row 1: [16,128,16,4] → No merges (16,128,16,4).  \n- Row 2: [256,8,64,0] → Shifts right to [0,256,8,64] (no merges).  \n- Row 3: [32,16,8,2] → No merges (32,16,8,2).  \n- **Result**: No merges, no strategic improvement.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns shift down, but no adjacent equal tiles merge.  \n- Example: Column 3 ([0,4,0,2]) shifts to [0,0,4,2] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges, no strategic improvement.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns shift up, creating key opportunities:  \n  - Column 3 ([0,4,0,2]) shifts up to [4,2,0,0].  \n  - Row 0 becomes [4,8,4,4] (4 in column 2 and 4 in column 3 are now adjacent).  \n  - This sets up a future merge of the two 4s in Row 0 if a subsequent LEFT move is made.  \n- **Result**: No immediate merges, but strategically positions tiles for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion  \nUP is the best move because it aligns two 4s in Row 0 (columns 2 and 3), creating a merge opportunity in the next move. This setup improves the potential for future scoring and strategic tile arrangement.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate potential merges and score gains.

Result: `[0, 256, 8, 64]`.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `[32, 16, 8, 4]` have no merges (non-zero and no adjacent equals).  \n**Total Score Gain**: 8 + 16 = 24.\n\n### UP Swipe Analysis:\n- All columns have no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur.  \n**Total Score Gain**: 0.\n\n### DOWN Swipe Analysis:\n- All columns have no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur.  \n**Total Score Gain**: 0.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe RIGHT swipe yields the highest score gain (24) due to merging two `4`s into `8` and then two `8`s into `16` in Row 0.

Result: [0, 0, 8, 32].  \n- Column 0 (128, 16, 0, 32): Shifts down to [0, 128, 16, 32].  \n- **Key Setup**: Row 1 becomes [128, 128, 0, 2] (two adjacent 128s). This sets up a future LEFT swipe to merge 128+128=256 (high-value merge).  \n- **Score gain**: 48. Strong future merge potential.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhile UP and DOWN both yield 48 points, DOWN strategically positions two 128s in Row 1, enabling a high-value merge in the next move.

Swiping UP merges these 256s into a 512 (score gain: 512). After merging, the column shifts up, resulting in `[128, 512, 4, 0]`. Other columns have no merges but may shift (e.g., column 3 shifts up to `[2, 4, 0, 0]`).  \n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Columns are processed bottom-to-top.

After merging, the column shifts down, resulting in `[0, 128, 512, 4]`. Other columns have no merges but may shift (e.g., column 3 shifts down to `[0, 0, 2, 4]`).  \n\n### Key Decision:  \nBoth UP and DOWN merge the 256s for a 512 score. However, UP is preferable because merging upward aligns the 512 (the new largest tile) in row 1, column 1, which is more central and leaves more empty spaces in lower rows for future moves. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner-adjacent position to facilitate future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging opportunities, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 128 | 16 | 2\nRow 1: 8 | 512 | 8 | 4\nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 16 | 0\nRow 3: 64 | 0 | 128 | 8\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No immediate merges**: There are no adjacent tiles with the same number in any direction (horizontal or vertical). Valid moves depend on shifting tiles into empty spaces (zeros).\n- **Larger tiles**: The largest tile is 512 (row 1, column 1), followed by 128 (row 0, column 1; row 3, column 2), 64 (row 3, column 0), and 16s (row 0, column 2; row 2, column 0; row 2, column 2).\n- **Empty spaces**: Two zeros are present at (row 2, column 3) and (row 3, column 1).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**:\n- Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. Row 3 (64, 0, 128, 8) becomes 64, 128, 8, 0. Other rows remain unchanged. No strategic advantage; minimal tile rearrangement.\n\n#### **RIGHT**:\n- Tiles shift right, but no merges occur. Row 2 (16, 4, 16, 0) becomes 0, 16, 4, 16. Row 3 (64, 0, 128, 8) becomes 0, 64, 128, 8. No meaningful tile alignment for future merges.\n\n#### **UP**:\n- Tiles shift up, but no merges occur. Column 3 (2, 4, 0, 8) becomes 2, 4, 8, 0. Column 1 (128, 512, 4, 0) becomes 128, 512, 4, 0. No significant repositioning of large tiles.\n\n#### **DOWN**:\n- Tiles shift down, with key rearrangements:\n  - Column 1 (128, 512, 4, 0) becomes 0, 128, 512, 4 (512 moves down to row 2, column 1).\n  - Column 3 (2, 4, 0, 8) becomes 0, 2, 4, 8 (smaller tiles stack at the bottom).\n  - Row 1 becomes 8, 128, 8, 2 (8s in columns 0 and 2, separated by 128).\n\n### Strategic Advantage of DOWN:\nMoving DOWN positions the 512 tile lower (row 2, column 1), aligning it toward a corner (bottom-left or bottom-right). Additionally, the 8s in row 1 (columns 0 and 2) are now positioned such that a future RIGHT move could shift them into adjacent positions, enabling a merge (8 + 8 = 16). This setup creates potential for future merges, which is critical for scoring.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities and keep larger tiles strategically positioned.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|16|32\nRow 1: 8|128|8|2\nRow 2: 16|512|16|4\nRow 3: 64|4|128|8\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Empty Tiles**: Only 1 empty tile (row 0, column 1).\n- **Largest Tiles**: 512 (row 2, column 1), 128 (row 1, column 1; row 3, column 2), 64 (row 3, column 0).\n- **Adjacent Same Tiles**: None. Valid moves depend on shifting tiles into the empty space.\n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0 shifts left: [4, 0, 16, 32] → [4, 16, 32, 0].  \n   - Other rows have no zeros, so no changes.  \n   - No merges occur. The empty tile moves to row 0, column 3.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0 shifts right: [4, 0, 16, 32] → [0, 4, 16, 32].  \n   - Other rows have no zeros, so no changes.  \n   - No merges occur. The empty tile moves to row 0, column 0.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 1 (with the empty tile) shifts up: [0, 128, 512, 4] → [128, 512, 4, 0].  \n   - This moves the 128 (row 1, column 1) up to the empty tile (row 0, column 1), shifts 512 (row 2, column 1) to row 1, column 1, and 4 (row 3, column 1) to row 2, column 1.  \n   - The empty tile moves to row 3, column 1.  \n   - Larger tiles (128, 512) are consolidated upward, potentially setting up future merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - No tiles can move into the empty space (row 0, column 1) because all tiles below are already as far down as possible.  \n   - No shifts or merges occur. **Invalid move**.  \n\n\n### Optimal Move:\nMoving **UP** consolidates larger tiles (128, 512) upward, positions them closer to each other, and creates a new empty space in a lower row (row 3, column 1). This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner and setting up future merging opportunities.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges, score gains, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 4 | 128 | 16 | 32  \nRow 1: 8 | 512 | 8 | 2  \nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 16 | 4  \nRow 3: 64 | 64 | 128 | 8  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: All tiles (4, 128, 16, 32) are distinct. No merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (8, 512, 8, 2) are distinct. No merges.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles (16, 4, 16, 4) are distinct. No merges.  \n- **Row 3**: 64 and 64 merge into 128 (score +128). The merged 128 and original 128 (third tile) are adjacent but cannot merge again in the same move. Row becomes [128, 128, 8, 0].  \n\n**Total Score**: 128.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles (4, 128, 16, 32) are distinct. No merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles (8, 512, 8, 2) are distinct. No merges.  \n- **Row 2**: 16 (first tile) and 16 (third tile) merge into 32 (score +32); 4 (second tile) and 4 (fourth tile) merge into 8 (score +8). Row becomes [0, 0, 32, 8].  \n- **Row 3**: 64 and 64 merge into 128 (score +128); the merged 128 and original 128 (third tile) merge into 256 (score +256). Row becomes [0, 0, 256, 8].  \n\n**Total Score**: 32 + 8 + 128 + 256 = 424.  \n\n\n#### **UP Move**:\n- All columns (4, 8, 16, 64; 128, 512, 4, 64; 16, 8, 16, 128; 32, 2, 4, 8) have distinct tiles. No merges.  \n\n**Total Score**: 0.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Move**:\n- Only Column 2 (16, 8, 16, 128) has a merge: 16 (first tile) and 16 (third tile) merge into 32 (score +32). Other columns have no merges.  \n\n**Total Score**: 32.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe RIGHT move yields the highest score (424) due to multiple merges (32, 8, 128, 256) and strategically positions larger tiles (e.g., 256) in the right, which aligns with the goal of keeping large tiles in a corner for future merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the potential merges and scores.

Merging them creates a 256 tile, with the row becoming (32, 256, 8, 0). This gives a score of 256.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0-2**: Tiles are all distinct; no merges.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles (32, 128, 128, 8) have adjacent 128s.

This aligns larger tiles vertically, which is strategic for future merges. RIGHT places the 256 in Column 2, which is less aligned with the 512. Thus, LEFT is better for long-term tile management.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges, score gain, and long-term strategy (keeping large tiles in a corner and maintaining compactness).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 128 | 16 | 32\nRow 1: 4 | 512 | 8 | 2\nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 16 | 4\nRow 3: 32 | 256 | 8 | 8\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are all distinct (64, 128, 16, 32) → no merges.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles are all distinct (4, 512, 8, 2) → no merges.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles are all distinct (8, 4, 16, 4) → no merges.\n- **Row 3**: Tiles are [32, 256, 8, 8].

Score gain: 0.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Merges**: Only LEFT and RIGHT moves yield merges (8s in row 3 → 16).\n- **Strategy**: Keeping large tiles (512, 256, 128) in column 1 (a strong column) is critical. LEFT move preserves 256 in column 1, aligning with this strategy. RIGHT move shifts 256 to column 2, weakening column 1.\n- **Empty Space**: LEFT move places the empty space in column 3, which is less disruptive to the existing structure compared to RIGHT move (empty space in column 0).\n\nThus, LEFT is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate potential merges and score gains.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 128 | 16 | 32  \nRow 1: 4 | 512 | 8 | 2  \nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 16 | 4  \nRow 3: 32 | 256 | 16 | 256  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Move**  \n- All rows have distinct tiles (no adjacent equal values). No merges occur. The board remains unchanged except for a new tile (2 or 4) added. **No score gain.**  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**  \n- **Row 3** (32 | 256 | 16 | 256) is critical. When moving right:  \n  - Tiles shift to the right. The 256 in column 1 moves past 16 (column 2) to column 2, and 16 shifts to column 1.  \n  - This results in [32, 16, 256, 256] for Row 3.

No adjacent same tiles exist in any row, so LEFT\/RIGHT are invalid.  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: For vertical moves, we check columns for adjacent same tiles. All columns have distinct values (e.g., Column 0: 64, 4, 8, 32; Column 3: 32, 2, 4, 256). No adjacent same tiles exist in any column, so UP\/DOWN are invalid.  \n\nSince the grid is full with no adjacent same tiles, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the strategic advice to cluster larger tiles (e.g., 512, 256, 128) and the lack of valid merges, **DOWN** is chosen as a default direction.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile movement. The grid is:\n\n```\n64|128|4|32\n4|512|16|2\n8|4|8|4\n32|256|32|256\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **No Empty Tiles**: All tiles are occupied (no `0`s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value to merge.\n2. **Adjacent Tiles Check**: We check horizontal and vertical adjacents for merges:\n   - **Horizontal (Same Row)**: No adjacent tiles with the same value in any row.\n   - **Vertical (Same Column)**: No adjacent tiles with the same value in any column.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipe**: Since all tiles are already packed with no gaps and no adjacent duplicates, swiping left or right will not shift or merge any tiles.\n- **UP\/DOWN Swipe**: Similarly, vertical swipes will not shift or merge tiles because there are no empty spaces and no vertical duplicates.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and there are no adjacent tiles to merge. Thus, no valid moves exist. However, per the problem constraints, the answer must be one of the four directions.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential and strategic positioning.

For example:  \n  - Row 0: 64, 128, 4, 32 (all distinct).  \n  - Row 1: 4, 512, 16, 2 (all distinct).  \n  - Row 2: 8, 4, 8, 4 (8s and 4s are separated by other tiles, not adjacent).  \n  - Row 3: 32, 256, 32, 256 (32s and 256s are separated by other tiles, not adjacent).  \n- **Valid Moves**: A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles or shifting into empty spaces. Since the grid is full, only merges count. No merges are possible in any direction.  \n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Tiles in each row cannot merge (no adjacent equals) and cannot shift (no empty spaces).  \n- **UP\/DOWN**: Tiles in each column cannot merge (no adjacent equals) and cannot shift (no empty spaces).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions result in no valid merges or shifts. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the options, the choice defaults to a direction that minimally disrupts tile positioning. \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid, which is fully occupied (no empty tiles, 0s) and contains no adjacent equal tiles. A valid move requires either merging adjacent equal tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since the grid is full, valid moves depend on merging adjacent equal tiles.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All rows have non-adjacent distinct values. For example, Row 0: [64, 128, 4, 32] has no adjacent equals; Row 2: [8, 4, 8, 4] has 8s and 4s separated by other tiles (no adjacency); Row 3: [32, 256, 32, 256] has 32s and 256s separated by other tiles.

For example, Column 0: [64, 4, 8, 32] and Column 3: [32, 2, 4, 256] have no adjacent equals. No merges or shifts are possible.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   All columns have non-adjacent distinct values. For example, Column 1: [128, 512, 4, 256] and Column 2: [4, 16, 8, 32] have no adjacent equals. No merges or shifts are possible.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent equal tiles, so no valid moves exist. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.

Shifting down would not modify the grid, as no merges or shifts into empty spaces are possible.  \n\nSince there are no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles to merge, no valid moves exist. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, any direction is technically invalid, but we choose one as per the problem’s requirement.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same value. Here's the breakdown for each direction:\n\n### LEFT Swipe\n- **Row 1 (64|128|4|32):** All tiles are distinct. No merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Row 2 (4|512|16|2):** All tiles are distinct. No merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Row 3 (8|4|8|4):** Tiles are 8, 4, 8, 4. Adjacent tiles are distinct (8≠4, 4≠8, 8≠4). No merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Row 4 (32|256|32|256):** Tiles are 32, 256, 32, 256. Adjacent tiles are distinct (32≠256, 256≠32, 32≠256). No merging or shifting occurs.  \n\n### RIGHT Swipe\n- **Row 1 (64|128|4|32):** All tiles are distinct. No merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Row 2 (4|512|16|2):** All tiles are distinct. No merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Row 3 (8|4|8|4):** Tiles are 8, 4, 8, 4. Adjacent tiles are distinct (8≠4, 4≠8, 8≠4). No merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Row 4 (32|256|32|256):** Tiles are 32, 256, 32, 256. Adjacent tiles are distinct (32≠256, 256≠32, 32≠256). No merging or shifting occurs.  \n\n### UP Swipe\n- **Column 1 (64|4|8|32):** All tiles are distinct. No merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Column 2 (128|512|4|256):** All tiles are distinct. No merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Column 3 (4|16|8|32):** All tiles are distinct. No merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Column 4 (32|2|4|256):** All tiles are distinct. No merging or shifting occurs.  \n\n### DOWN Swipe\n- **Column 1 (64|4|8|32):** All tiles are distinct. No merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Column 2 (128|512|4|256):** All tiles are distinct. No merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Column 3 (4|16|8|32):** All tiles are distinct. No merging or shifting occurs.  \n- **Column 4 (32|2|4|256):** All tiles are distinct. No merging or shifting occurs.  \n\n### Conclusion\nThe grid is full (no empty tiles), and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. Thus, **no valid moves** exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we arbitrarily choose LEFT (as all directions are invalid).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement. The grid is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 128 | 4 | 32  \nRow 1: 4 | 512 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 8 | 4  \nRow 3: 32 | 256 | 32 | 256  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid Status**: All tiles are occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value to merge. If no such pairs exist, the game ends.\n2. **Row Analysis**:\n   - **Row 0**: 64, 128, 4, 32 (all distinct, no merges possible).\n   - **Row 1**: 4, 512, 16, 2 (all distinct, no merges possible).\n   - **Row 2**: 8, 4, 8, 4 (adjacent tiles are distinct; 8s and 4s are separated by different values, so no merges).\n   - **Row 3**: 32, 256, 32, 256 (adjacent tiles are distinct; 32s and 256s are separated by different values, so no merges).\n3. **Column Analysis**:\n   - **Column 0**: 64, 4, 8, 32 (all distinct, no merges).\n   - **Column 1**: 128, 512, 4, 256 (all distinct, no merges).\n   - **Column 2**: 4, 16, 8, 32 (all distinct, no merges).\n   - **Column 3**: 32, 2, 4, 256 (all distinct, no merges).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Shifting tiles left or right in any row does not create adjacent equal tiles (all rows have distinct adjacent values). No merges occur.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Shifting tiles up or down in any column does not create adjacent equal tiles (all columns have distinct adjacent values). No merges occur.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent tiles can merge. However, since the problem requires selecting a move (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and no direction leads to immediate merges, the choice defaults to a direction that minimally disrupts tile organization. Given the larger tiles (e.g., 512, 256) are spread out, any direction is functionally equivalent in the short term. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 128 | 4 | 32\nRow 1: 4 | 512 | 16 | 2\nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 8 | 4\nRow 3: 32 | 256 | 32 | 256\n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: All tiles are distinct (64, 128, 4, 32). No merges; remains unchanged.\n- **Row 1**: All tiles are distinct (4, 512, 16, 2). No merges; remains unchanged.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles [8, 4, 8, 4] shift left. Adjacent 8s merge into 16 (score +16), and adjacent 4s merge into 8 (score +8). Result: [16, 8, 0, 0].\n- **Row 3**: Tiles [32, 256, 32, 256] shift left. Adjacent 32s merge into 64 (score +64), and adjacent 256s merge into 512 (score +512). Result: [64, 512, 0, 0].\n\n**Total merges for LEFT**: 16 + 8 + 64 + 512 = 590. Larger tiles (512, 16) are positioned left, aligning with a corner strategy.\n\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: All tiles are distinct (64, 128, 4, 32). No merges; remains unchanged.\n- **Row 1**: All tiles are distinct (4, 512, 16, 2). No merges; remains unchanged.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles [8, 4, 8, 4] shift right. No adjacent merges (8s and 4s are not aligned); remains unchanged.\n- **Row 3**: Tiles [32, 256, 32, 256] shift right. Adjacent 32s merge into 64 (score +64), and adjacent 256s merge into 512 (score +512). Result: [0, 64, 0, 512].\n\n**Total merges for RIGHT**: 64 + 512 = 576. Fewer merges than LEFT, and larger tiles are scattered with zeros.\n\n\n### UP\/DOWN Moves:\n- **UP**: All columns (64, 4, 8, 32; 128, 512, 4, 256; 4, 16, 8, 32; 32, 2, 4, 256) have distinct tiles. No merges or shifts.\n- **DOWN**: All columns are full with distinct tiles. No merges or shifts.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT maximizes merges (590 score) and positions larger tiles (512, 16) strategically in the left, supporting future moves. RIGHT has fewer merges, and UP\/DOWN have none. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and score gains.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 128 | 4 | 32\nRow 1: 4 | 512 | 16 | 2\nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 8 | 4\nRow 3: 32 | 256 | 32 | 256\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   - All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 2: `8,4,8,4` and Row 3: `32,256,32,256` cannot merge when shifted left because the same numbers are separated by different values. No merges occur.  \n\n2. **UP Move**:  \n   - Columns (vertical analysis) have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Column 0: `64,4,8,32` and Column 1: `128,512,4,256` are all distinct. No merges occur.  \n\n3. **DOWN Move**:  \n   - Similar to UP, columns have no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur.  \n\n4. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - **Row 2**: `8,4,8,4` can merge when shifted right. The 8s (positions 0 and 2) and 4s (positions 1 and 3) align to merge:  \n     - `8 + 8 = 16` (score +16).  \n     - `4 + 4 = 8` (score +8).  \n     Result: `[0, 0, 16, 8]`.  \n   - **Row 3**: `32,256,32,256` can merge when shifted right. The 32s (positions 0 and 2) and 256s (positions 1 and 3) align to merge:  \n     - `32 + 32 = 64` (score +64).  \n     - `256 + 256 = 512` (score +512).  \n     Result: `[0, 0, 64, 512]`.  \n\nRIGHT move results in four merges (8+8, 4+4, 32+32, 256+256) with a total score gain of \\(16 + 8 + 64 + 512 = 600\\), which is significantly higher than other moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and the rules of merging tiles.

For example:  \n  - Column 0: `64 | 4 | 8 | 32` has no duplicates.  \n  - Column 3: `32 | 2 | 4 | 256` has no duplicates.  \n  No merges occur in any column for up\/down swipes.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent tiles are equal. By the rules, there are no valid moves. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any direction is technically a placeholder (as no merges occur).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges and valid moves. The current board is:\n\n```\n64|128|4|32\n4|512|16|2\n8|4|8|4\n32|256|32|256\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid State**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same value (since empty spaces are absent).\n2. **Horizontal Adjacents**: Checking rows for adjacent equal values:\n   - Row 1: 64, 128, 4, 32 (all distinct).\n   - Row 2: 4, 512, 16, 2 (all distinct).\n   - Row 3: 8, 4, 8, 4 (8s and 4s are separated by different values, not adjacent).\n   - Row 4: 32, 256, 32, 256 (32s and 256s are separated by different values, not adjacent).\n3. **Vertical Adjacents**: Checking columns for adjacent equal values:\n   - Column 1: 64, 4, 8, 32 (all distinct).\n   - Column 2: 128, 512, 4, 256 (all distinct).\n   - Column 3: 4, 16, 8, 32 (all distinct).\n   - Column 4: 32, 2, 4, 256 (all distinct).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere are no adjacent tiles with the same value, and the grid is full (no empty spaces). By the rules, a valid move requires either adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to shift tiles into. Since neither condition is met, **no valid moves exist**. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. In such cases, any direction is technically invalid, but the game will end after the move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move for the given 4x4 grid in epoch 99, we analyze the validity of each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or shifting tiles into empty spaces. The grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles in the direction of the swipe.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 64 | 128 | 4 | 32  \nRow 1: 4 | 512 | 16 | 2  \nRow 2: 8 | 4 | 8 | 4  \nRow 3: 32 | 256 | 32 | 256  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: All tiles (64, 128, 4, 32) are distinct.

However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we arbitrarily choose based on strategic considerations (e.g., preparing for the final epoch). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move for the 100th epoch, we analyze the game board and evaluate the score potential of each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n64|128|4|32\n4|512|16|2\n8|4|8|4\n32|256|32|256\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Merging these tiles will yield a higher score (4) and is strategically beneficial.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   - Swiping LEFT or RIGHT affects rows. Each row (Row 1 and Row 2) contains only one 2. Moving left\/right shifts the 2 to the leftmost\/rightmost position in its row but does not merge any tiles (no score gain). These moves do not utilize the vertical alignment of the 2s.  \n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - Swiping UP affects columns. In Column 2, the two 2s (Row 1 and Row 2) shift upward. Since they are adjacent and equal, they merge into a 4. The merged tile occupies (1,2), and the rest of Column 2 becomes empty. This move generates a score of 4.  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Swiping DOWN also affects Column 2. The two 2s (Row 1 and Row 2) shift downward to the bottom of the column (Row 3 and Row 4). They merge into a 4, which occupies (4,2). This move also generates a score of 4.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe goal is to keep larger tiles in a corner for future merges. Swiping UP places the merged 4 in (1,2), adjacent to the top-left corner (1,1). This positions the tile to potentially shift into the corner with subsequent moves (e.g., a left swipe if a new tile appears in (1,1)). Swiping DOWN places the 4 in (4,2), adjacent to the bottom-left corner (4,1), but the top-left corner is more commonly used as a strategic anchor in 2048. Thus, UP is slightly more advantageous for future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile movement, merging potential, and strategic positioning (keeping larger tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|4|2|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **UP**: Tiles in row 0 (4 and 2) are already in the top row and cannot move upward. No tiles shift or merge, making this an invalid move (no empty space above to move into, and no adjacent equal tiles to merge).  \n\n2. **LEFT**: Moving left shifts row 0’s tiles to the left, resulting in row 0: [4, 2, 0, 0]. No merging occurs (4 and 2 are different). While this is valid, the tiles remain in the top row, which is less optimal for corner-based strategy.  \n\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving right shifts row 0’s tiles to the right, resulting in row 0: [0, 0, 4, 2]. No merging occurs. The tiles stay in the top row, similar to the LEFT move, but still not leveraging corner positioning.  \n\n4. **DOWN**: Moving down shifts tiles in columns 1 and 2 (4 and 2) to the bottom row (row 3). After moving down, the board becomes:  \n   Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 0|4|2|0  \n   This is a valid move, and the tiles are now in the bottom row (a corner), aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners. This positions them to potentially merge with future tiles added to the bottom row, facilitating higher-score combinations.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN optimally positions the existing tiles (4 and 2) in the bottom row (a corner), supporting strategic merging and long-term score growth.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the potential outcomes of each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board State:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 2|4|2|0\n```\nAll tiles are in the bottom row (Row 3). We evaluate each move:\n\n### 1. Swipe LEFT:\n- The bottom row `[2,4,2,0]` shifts left. Since there are no adjacent equal tiles to merge, the row remains `[2,4,2,0]` (tiles are already left-aligned). No merging occurs, and a new tile (2 or 4) will spawn in an empty spot. This does not consolidate tiles effectively.\n\n### 2. Swipe RIGHT:\n- The bottom row `[2,4,2,0]` shifts right. Tiles move to the rightmost positions, resulting in `[0,2,4,2]`. No merging occurs (no adjacent equal tiles), and a new tile will spawn. This scatters the tiles further right but does not consolidate them.\n\n### 3. Swipe UP:\n- Each column is processed, moving tiles upward. The tiles in Row 3 (2, 4, 2) shift to the top of their respective columns:\n  - Column 0: 2 moves to Row 0.\n  - Column 1: 4 moves to Row 0.\n  - Column 2: 2 moves to Row 0.\n  - Column 3: Remains empty.\n- After swiping up, the board becomes:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 2|4|2|0\n  Row 1: 0|0|0|0\n  Row 2: 0|0|0|0\n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0\n  ```\n- No merging occurs, but all existing tiles are consolidated in the top row. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (top row) to facilitate future merges. A new tile will spawn in an empty spot, potentially creating adjacent equal tiles for future moves.\n\n### 4. Swipe DOWN:\n- Tiles are already in the bottom row (Row 3), so no movement occurs. The board remains unchanged, and a new tile will spawn. This is ineffective as it does not consolidate or reposition tiles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping UP consolidates all existing tiles in the top row, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner. This positions the board for potential future merges (e.g., if a new tile spawns adjacent to existing tiles in the top row). Other moves (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) do not consolidate tiles as effectively.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging potential:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 2|4|2|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- Row 0: [2,4,2,0] shifts left (no merges, as 2,4,2 are distinct).  \n- Row 1: [2,0,0,0] shifts left (no merges).  \n- Rows 2-3: All zeros (no change).  \n- **Result**: No merges, no score gain.  \n\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- Row 0: [2,4,2,0] shifts right to [0,2,4,2] (no merges).  \n- Row 1: [2,0,0,0] shifts right to [0,0,0,2] (no merges).  \n- Rows 2-3: All zeros (no change).  \n- **Result**: No merges, no score gain.  \n\n\n### UP Move:\n- Column 0: [2 (row0), 2 (row1), 0, 0] shifts up.

The two 2s merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in [0,0,0,4].  \n- Column 1: [4 (row0), 0, 0, 0] shifts down to [0,0,0,4] (no merge).  \n- Column 2: [2 (row0), 0, 0, 0] shifts down to [0,0,0,2] (no merge).  \n- Column 3: All zeros (no change).  \n- **Result**: Merges two 2s into 4 (score +4). New board (before adding a new tile):  \n  Row 3: 4|4|2|0  \n  Rows 0-2: All zeros.  \n\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\nThe goal is to merge tiles strategically and keep larger tiles in a corner. The UP move positions the merged 4 in the top-left corner (row 0, column 0), with another 4 adjacent (row 0, column 1). This setup allows potential future merges (e.g., swiping left to merge the two 4s into 8), which aligns with the strategy of building larger tiles in a corner. In contrast, the DOWN move places the merged 4 in the bottom-left corner, which is less optimal for immediate follow-up merges.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging rules.

The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), and the 2 moves to the next available spot. Result: [8, 2, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 1**: [0,2,0,0] → Tiles shift left. The 2 moves to the first position. Result: [2, 0, 0, 0].  \n- Rows 2 and 3 remain unchanged (all zeros).  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 4s into 8, consolidates tiles on the left, and keeps larger tiles in the top-left corner (strategic for future merges).  \n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: [4,4,2,0] → Tiles shift right. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8), and the 2 moves to the rightmost position. Result: [0, 0, 2, 8].  \n- **Row 1**: [0,2,0,0] → Tiles shift right. The 2 moves to the rightmost position. Result: [0, 0, 0, 2].  \n- Rows 2 and 3 remain unchanged.  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 4s into 8 but scatters tiles to the right, making future consolidations harder.  \n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- Columns are processed vertically. All non-zero tiles are already at the top (no movement or merging possible).  \n- **Outcome**: No valid moves (tiles do not shift or merge).  \n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- Columns are processed vertically. Tiles shift down but do not merge (no adjacent equal tiles in columns).  \n- **Outcome**: Tiles are scattered downward with no merges, reducing strategic consolidation.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe LEFT swipe merges the 4s into 8 (maximizing score) and consolidates tiles on the left, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner.

The 4s in row 3 (columns 2-3) are adjacent, setting up a potential merge in the next move (e.g., swiping right to merge them into 8).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move. It merges two 2s (scoring 4) and positions 4s adjacently for future merges, while keeping larger tiles (8) in a corner for strategic growth.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

The two 8s in row 0, columns 2 and 3 are adjacent, creating a direct opportunity to merge them into 16 with a subsequent LEFT swipe. This positions larger tiles (8s) in the top-right corner, aligning with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:\n   - Column 0: `0|0|0|2` (2 shifts down to row 3).\n   - Column 1: No change (all zeros).\n   - Column 2: `0|0|8|4` (8 and 4 shift down, no merge).\n   - Column 3: `0|0|0|8` (two 4s merge into 8, +8 score).\n   - Result: Larger tiles (8s) are spread across rows 2 and 3, with no adjacent merging opportunities in the immediate next move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe positions the 8s adjacently in the top row, enabling a future merge into 16.

Non-zero tiles: [2, 8, 8]. The two 8s merge into 16, so row 0 becomes [2, 16, 0, 0] (score +16).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left. Non-zero tiles: [4, 4]. They merge into 8, so row 1 becomes [8, 0, 0, 0] (score +8).  \n- Result: 16 is in (0,1) (not a corner), 8 is in (1,0).  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. Non-zero tiles: [2, 8, 8]. The two 8s merge into 16, placed at the rightmost column (3). The 2 shifts to column 2, so row 0 becomes [0, 0, 2, 16] (score +16).  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right. Non-zero tiles: [4, 4]. They merge into 8, placed at the rightmost column (3), so row 1 becomes [0, 0, 0, 8] (score +8).  \n- Result: 16 is in (0,3) (top-right corner), 8 is in (1,3) (directly below 16 in the same column).  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Tiles shift up in columns. No merges occur because no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles shift down in columns. No merges occur because no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **LEFT** and **RIGHT** both merge tiles (16 and 8) and generate score, but **RIGHT** strategically positions the largest tile (16) in the top-right corner (a corner is optimal for future merges).  \n- The 8 in (1,3) (RIGHT result) is directly below 16, creating a vertical alignment that facilitates future merges (e.g., if another 8 appears in row 2,3, swiping up could merge them).  \n\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 2 | 0 | 2 | 16  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 8  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two 2s merge into 4, resulting in [4, 16, 0, 0]. Score: +4.  \n- **Row 1**: The 8 shifts left to [8, 0, 0, 0]. No merges.  \n- **Rows 2-3**: No changes.  \n- **Outcome**: The 16 moves to (0,1), not a corner. Larger tiles are not optimally positioned.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two 2s merge into 4, resulting in [0, 0, 4, 16]. Score: +4.  \n- **Row 1**: The 8 stays in (1,3) (no change).  \n- **Rows 2-3**: No changes.  \n- **Outcome**: The 16 remains in the top-right corner (0,3), and the merged 4 is adjacent to it. This positions larger tiles in a corner, a strategic advantage for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns shift up. All tiles are already as high as possible (no empty spaces above them). No merges occur.  \n- **Outcome**: No score, and tile positions remain unchanged.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns shift down. Tiles spread to the bottom rows (e.g., 2s move to (3,0) and (3,2); 16 moves to (2,3), 8 to (3,3)).  \n- **Outcome**: Larger tiles (16, 8) are spread out, not in a corner. Poor positioning for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving RIGHT keeps the 16 in the top-right corner, merges the 2s into 4 (adjacent to 16), and maintains strategic positioning for future moves.

This aligns two 4s vertically, setting up a potential merge in the next move (e.g., swiping UP would merge these 4s into 8).  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Columns shift up, but no merges occur.

The 16 is initially in the bottom-right corner (row 2, column 3). A DOWN swipe preserves the 16 in this corner, while an UP swipe moves it to row 1, column 3 (not a corner). Additionally, the DOWN swipe leaves two 8s adjacent in row 3, which can merge with a subsequent RIGHT swipe, creating opportunities for higher scores.  \n\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the resulting board state, focusing on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement (preferably keeping larger tiles in a corner).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|4|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|4\nRow 2: 0|0|0|16\nRow 3: 0|2|8|8\n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,4,0] → shifts left to [4,0,0,0] (no merge).\n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,4] → shifts left to [4,0,0,0] (no merge).\n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,16] → shifts left to [16,0,0,0] (no merge).\n- **Row 3**: [0,2,8,8] → shifts left to [2,16,0,0] (8+8 merges to 16, +16 score).\n\nResulting board after LEFT:\n```\n4|0|0|0\n4|0|0|0\n16|0|0|0\n2|16|0|0\n```\nLarger tiles (16s) are spread across columns 0 and 1, with no clear corner concentration.\n\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,4,0] → shifts right to [0,0,0,4] (no merge).\n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,4] → shifts right to [0,0,0,4] (no merge).\n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,16] → shifts right to [0,0,0,16] (no merge).\n- **Row 3**: [0,2,8,8] → shifts right to [0,0,2,16] (8+8 merges to 16, +16 score).\n\nResulting board after RIGHT:\n```\n0|0|0|4\n0|0|0|4\n0|0|0|16\n0|0|2|16\n```\nLarger tiles (16s) are concentrated in the rightmost column (column 3), with 4s stacked above them in the same column. This setup allows for potential vertical merges (e.g., 4+4 and 16+16) in subsequent moves, and the 16s occupy the bottom-right corner, a strategic position.\n\n\n### UP Move:\n- Columns are processed top-to-bottom, but no adjacent equal tiles exist.

The resulting board has scattered small tiles with no strategic positioning. Not optimal.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nTiles shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row). The board remains largely unchanged, with no meaningful progress. Not optimal.\n\n#### **UP**  \nTiles shift upward. In column 3:  \n- The 4s (row 0 and row 1) merge into 8 (score +8).  \n- The 16s (row 2 and row 3) merge into 32 (score +32).  \nResulting board:  \n```\nRow 0: 0|8|2|8  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|32  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n```  \nWhile merging 4s and 16s yields 40 points, the 32 ends up in row 1 (not a corner), which is less stable for future merges.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \nTiles shift downward. In column 3:  \n- The 16s (row 2 and row 3) merge into 32 (score +32).  \n- The 4s (row 0 and row 1) merge into 8 (score +8).  \nResulting board:  \n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 3: 0|8|2|32  \n```  \nThe 32 merges into the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), a strategic position for building larger tiles. This aligns with the goal of keeping large tiles in corners for stability.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nDOWN is optimal because it merges the 16s into 32 in the bottom-right corner (a stable position) and merges the 4s into 8 above it, setting up for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on strategic goals (merging potential, positioning large tiles, and setting up future moves).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|2\nRow 2: 0|0|0|8\nRow 3: 0|8|2|32\n```\nKey observations:\n- The largest tile (32) is in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), an ideal position to protect it.\n- Smaller tiles (2, 8) are scattered, with two 2s (row 1, column 3 and row 3, column 2) that could potentially merge if aligned.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros, no change.\n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,2] → shifts to [2,0,0,0].\n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,8] → shifts to [8,0,0,0].\n- **Row 3**: [0,8,2,32] → shifts to [8,2,32,0].\n- **Result**: No merges occur. Tiles shift left, but the 32 moves to row 3, column 2 (away from the corner), and the two 2s remain isolated.\n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros, no change.\n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,2] → remains [0,0,0,2] (already right-aligned).\n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,8] → remains [0,0,0,8] (already right-aligned).\n- **Row 3**: [0,8,2,32] → remains [0,8,2,32] (no space to shift right).\n- **Result**: No changes to tile positions except adding a new tile. No merges or strategic improvements.\n\n#### 3. UP:\n- **Column 0**: All zeros, no change.\n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,8] → shifts up to [8,0,0,0].\n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,2] → shifts up to [2,0,0,0].\n- **Column 3**: [0,2,8,32] → shifts up to [2,8,32,0].\n- **Result**: The two 2s (from row 1, column 3 and row 3, column 2) are now in row 0, columns 2 and 3, adjacent horizontally. This sets up a future merge (e.g., a subsequent LEFT move would merge them into a 4). The 32 remains in the right column (row 2, column 3), preserving its corner-adjacent position.\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: All zeros, no change.\n- **Column 1**: [0,0,0,8] → remains [0,0,0,8] (already bottom-aligned).\n- **Column 2**: [0,0,0,2] → remains [0,0,0,2] (already bottom-aligned).\n- **Column 3**: [0,2,8,32] → remains [0,2,8,32] (no space to shift down).\n- **Result**: No changes to tile positions except adding a new tile. No merges or strategic improvements.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP aligns the two 2s in row 0, columns 2 and 3, creating a setup for a future merge. This move preserves the 32 in a corner-adjacent position and strategically positions smaller tiles for potential merging. Other moves either leave tiles scattered or fail to set up future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

Merge 2s → [8, 4, 0, 0] (score +4).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 0, 8] → Shift left → [8, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 2**: [0, 0, 0, 32] → Shift left → [32, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 3**: [4, 0, 0, 0] → No change.  \n- **Result**: Larger tiles (32, 8, 8, 4) cluster in the left column, but the largest tile (32) is no longer in a corner.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0, 8, 2, 2] → Shift right → [0, 8, 2, 2]. Merge 2s → [0, 8, 0, 4] (score +4).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 0, 8] → No change (8 is already rightmost).  \n- **Row 2**: [0, 0, 0, 32] → No change (32 is already rightmost).  \n- **Row 3**: [4, 0, 0, 0] → Shift right → [0, 0, 0, 4].  \n- **Result**: Larger tiles (4, 8, 32, 4) cluster in the right column, with the largest tile (32) securely in the bottom-right corner. This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns shift upward, but no merges occur. The largest tile (32) remains in row 2, column 3, but smaller tiles (2, 8, 4) scatter across the grid. No clear advantage.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns shift downward, but no merges occur. The largest tile (32) moves to row 3, column 3 (bottom-right corner), but other tiles (4, 8, 2) spread across the bottom row. No immediate scoring and less strategic clustering.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nMoving RIGHT keeps the largest tile (32) in the bottom-right corner, clusters smaller tiles toward the right column, and provides a scoring opportunity (merging 2s in row 0). This aligns with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges, keep larger tiles in corners, and set up for future merges.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|8|4\nRow 1: 0|0|8|8\nRow 2: 0|0|0|32\nRow 3: 0|0|0|4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,8,4] → shifts left to [8,4,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,8,8] → shifts left, merging 8+8 into 16 → [16,0,0,0] (score +16).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,32] → shifts left to [32,0,0,0].  \n- **Row 3**: [0,0,0,4] → shifts left to [4,0,0,0].  \n- **Result**: 32 (row 2, column 0), 16 (row 1, column 0), 8 (row 0, column 0), and 4 (row 3, column 0) cluster in the left column. While merging occurs, the 32 (a large tile) is moved from its original right corner.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,8,4] → already right-aligned (no change).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,8,8] → shifts right, merging 8+8 into 16 → [0,0,0,16] (score +16).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,32] → already right-aligned (no change).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,0,0,4] → already right-aligned (no change).  \n- **Result**: 32 (row 2, column 3) remains in the right corner, 16 (row 1, column 3) is directly above it, and 4 (row 3, column 3) is below. This keeps large tiles (32, 16) in the right corner, setting up for potential future merges (e.g., 16+16 or 32+32).\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0-1**: All zeros (no change).  \n- **Column 2**: [8,8,0,0] → shifts up, merging 8+8 into 16 → [16,0,0,0] (score +16).  \n- **Column 3**: [4,8,32,4] → already up-aligned (no merge).  \n- **Result**: 16 (row 0, column 2) is placed in the middle, while 32 (row 2, column 3) stays in the right corner. This leaves 32 isolated without adjacent large tiles for future merges.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0-1**: All zeros (no change).  \n- **Column 2**: [8,8,0,0] → shifts down, merging 8+8 into 16 → [0,0,0,16] (score +16).  \n- **Column 3**: [4,8,32,4] → already down-aligned (no merge).  \n- **Result**: 16 (row 3, column 2) is placed in the bottom-middle, while 32 (row 2, column 3) remains in the right corner. This leaves 16 and 4 (row 3, column 3) adjacent but not strategically positioned for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping **RIGHT** preserves the 32 in its right-corner position, merges the 8s in row 1 into 16 (placing it directly above 32), and keeps smaller tiles (4) in the right column. This setup maximizes the potential for future merges (e.g., 16+16 or 32+32) and maintains large tiles in a corner, which is optimal for long-term progression.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to identify a move that sets up future merges and strategically positions larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|8|4  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|16  \nRow 2: 0|0|16|32  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **RIGHT**: All tiles are already as far right as possible (no tiles shift). This is an invalid move.  \n2. **DOWN**: Tiles shift down, but no merges occur. The resulting board has no adjacent equal tiles, providing no immediate or future merge opportunities.  \n3. **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. The resulting board clusters tiles on the left but does not create adjacent equal tiles for future merges.  \n4. **UP**: Tiles shift up. In row 1, after shifting, two 16s (from column 2 and column 3) become adjacent horizontally. While no merge occurs during the UP move, this positions the 16s to merge in a subsequent RIGHT swipe, creating a 32 tile (scoring 32). This setup is strategic for future high-value merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move because it positions two 16s adjacently in row 1, enabling a merge with a subsequent RIGHT swipe. This aligns with the strategy of setting up future merges to maximize scores.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|0|8|4  \nRow 1: 0|0|16|16  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|32  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**:\n- **Row 0**: [4, 0, 8, 4] → shifts left to [4, 8, 4, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 16, 16] → shifts left, merging 16s into 32 (score +32) → [32, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 2**: [0, 0, 0, 32] → shifts left to [32, 0, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 0, 4] → shifts left to [4, 0, 0, 0].  \n- Result: 32s in Row 1 and Row 2 (Column 0) could merge with an UP swipe later, but larger tiles cluster on the left edge.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**:\n- **Row 0**: [4, 0, 8, 4] → shifts right to [0, 4, 8, 4] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 16, 16] → shifts right, merging 16s into 32 (score +32) → [0, 0, 0, 32].  \n- **Row 2**: [0, 0, 0, 32] → shifts right to [0, 0, 0, 32] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [0, 0, 0, 4] → shifts right to [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merges).  \n- Result: 32s in Row 1 and Row 2 (Column 3) are vertically adjacent, setting up a potential merge into 64 with an UP swipe. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner (bottom-right corner here).  \n\n#### **UP**:\n- All columns are already maximally shifted upward, with no adjacent equal tiles to merge. No tiles move or merge → **invalid move**.  \n\n#### **DOWN**:\n- Tiles shift down, but no adjacent equal tiles merge. Only empty spaces are filled, but no score is gained → **less optimal than LEFT\/RIGHT**.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT is the best move. It merges the 16s in Row 1 into a 32 (scoring 32) and positions the 32s in Row 1 and Row 2 (Column 3), enabling a future merge into 64 with an UP swipe. This aligns with the strategy of concentrating larger tiles in a corner (bottom-right) for better long-term merging potential.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their effects on the game board:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|4|8|4\nRow 1: 0|0|0|32\nRow 2: 0|0|0|32\nRow 3: 0|2|0|4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,4,8,4] → shifts to [4,8,4,0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,32] → shifts to [32,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,0,32] → shifts to [32,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [0,2,0,4] → shifts to [2,4,0,0] (no merges).  \n   - **Result**: No merges, score = 0.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,4,8,4] → no change (tiles already right-aligned, no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [0,0,0,32] → no change (32 already rightmost).  \n   - Row 2: [0,0,0,32] → no change (32 already rightmost).  \n   - Row 3: [0,2,0,4] → shifts to [0,0,2,4] (no merges).  \n   - **Result**: No merges, score = 0.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 3 (critical column with 32s):  \n     - Original tiles: [4 (row0), 32 (row1), 32 (row2), 4 (row3)].  \n     - Tiles shift up, and the two 32s (row1 and row2) merge into 64 (score += 64).  \n     - Resulting column 3: [4 (row0), 64 (row1), 4 (row2), 0 (row3)].  \n   - Other columns:  \n     - Column 1: [4 (row0), 0, 0, 2 (row3)] → shifts to [4 (row0), 2 (row1), 0, 0].  \n     - Columns 0 and 2: No merges, remain mostly empty.  \n   - **Result**: Merges 32s into 64, score = 64.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 3 (critical column with 32s):  \n     - Original tiles: [4 (row0), 32 (row1), 32 (row2), 4 (row3)].  \n     - Tiles shift down, and the two 32s (row1 and row2) merge into 64 (score += 64).  \n     - Resulting column 3: [0 (row0), 4 (row1), 64 (row2), 4 (row3)].  \n   - Other columns:  \n     - Column 1: [4 (row0), 0, 0, 2 (row3)] → shifts to [0, 0, 4 (row2), 2 (row3)].  \n     - Column 2: [8 (row0), 0, 0, 0] → shifts to [0, 0, 0, 8 (row3)].  \n   - **Result**: Merges 32s into 64, score = 64.  \n\n\n### Key Consideration:\nBoth UP and DOWN merge the 32s into 64, but UP leaves row 3 completely empty (more flexibility for future moves) and positions the 64 in row 1, column 3 (right column, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner). DOWN leaves row 0 empty but positions the 64 in row 2, column 3 (less optimal for corner-based growth). Thus, UP is preferred.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

No merges occur because adjacent tiles in columns are distinct (e.g., 4, 64, 4 in column 3).  \n  **Result**: No score gain, and tile positions remain largely unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe RIGHT swipe is optimal because it merges the 2s in row 1 (scoring 4) while keeping the 64 tile in the rightmost column (a strategic corner position).

Similar to LEFT but shifts tiles right; still limited future merging.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 1** (vertical): [16,0,16,0] → Shift up → [16,16,0,0] → Merge 16+16=32 (Score +32).  \n- **Column 2**: [8,4,0,0] → Shift up → [8,4,0,0] (No merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [8,64,8,0] → Shift up → [8,64,8,0] (No merge).  \n- **Row 0**: [0,32,8,8] (32 from merged 16s, 8s adjacent).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,4,64] (64 remains in column 3).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,0,8] (8 shifted up).  \n- **Row 3**: All zeros.  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 16+16=32 (score +32). 8s in Row 0 (columns 2-3) are adjacent, enabling a future RIGHT swipe to merge them (8+8=16). 64 remains in column 3, close to the bottom-right corner.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 1**: [16,0,16,0] → Shift down → [0,0,16,16] → Merge 16+16=32 (Score +32).  \n- **Column 2**: [8,4,0,0] → Shift down → [0,0,8,4] (No merge).  \n- **Column 3**: [8,64,8,0] → Shift down → [0,8,64,8] (No merge).  \n- **Row 3**: [0,32,4,8] (32 from merged 16s).  \n- **Row 2**: [0,0,8,64] (64 shifted down).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,8] (8 shifted down).  \n- **Row 0**: All zeros.  \n- **Outcome**: Merges 16+16=32 (score +32). 8s in Column 3 (rows 1 and 3) are not adjacent, limiting future merging. 64 shifts to Row 2 (column 3), but no immediate merging opportunities.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP and DOWN both merge two 16s into 32 (score +32). However, UP leaves 8s in Row 0 (columns 2-3) adjacent, creating a future merging opportunity (RIGHT swipe). Additionally, 64 remains in Row 1 (column 3), close to the bottom-right corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners. UP is thus the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. The goal is to maximize merges, maintain high-value tiles in corners, and set up future merging opportunities.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|32|8|8  \nRow 1: 0|0|4|64  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 3: 0|0|32|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: `[0, 32, 8, 8]` → Tiles shift left, merging the two `8`s into `16`. New row: `[32, 16, 0, 0]` (score +16).  \n- **Row 1**: `[0, 0, 4, 64]` → Tiles shift left to `[4, 64, 0, 0]` (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: `[0, 0, 0, 8]` → Tiles shift left to `[8, 0, 0, 0]` (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: `[0, 0, 32, 0]` → Tiles shift left to `[32, 0, 0, 0]` (no merge).  \n- **Outcome**: High-value tiles (`32`, `16`, `64`) are scattered in the left\/middle columns. The `64` (highest tile) moves from column 3 to column 1, leaving it exposed in the middle.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: `[0, 32, 8, 8]` → Tiles shift right, merging the two `8`s into `16`. New row: `[0, 32, 0, 16]` (score +16).  \n- **Row 1**: `[0, 0, 4, 64]` → Tiles shift right (no merge) → `[0, 0, 4, 64]`.  \n- **Row 2**: `[0, 0, 0, 8]` → Tiles shift right (no merge) → `[0, 0, 0, 8]`.  \n- **Row 3**: `[0, 0, 32, 0]` → Tiles shift right to `[0, 0, 0, 32]` (no merge).  \n- **Outcome**: High-value tiles (`64`, `16`, `32`) are aligned in the right column (column 3). The `64` (highest tile) remains in column 3 (a corner-adjacent position), and merged `16` and `32` also occupy column 3, setting up potential vertical merges in future moves.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- Columns are processed, but no merges occur. Tiles shift upward but remain unmerged.  \n- **Outcome**: No score gain, and high-value tiles remain scattered.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- Columns are processed, but no merges occur. Tiles shift downward but remain unmerged.  \n- **Outcome**: No score gain, and high-value tiles are spread across columns.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe RIGHT swipe merges the `8`s in Row 0 into a `16` (score +16) and keeps the highest tile (`64`) in the right column (column 3). Aligning high-value tiles in the right column (a corner-adjacent area) strategically positions them for future vertical merges, making RIGHT the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging rules:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 1: 32|0|32|16  \nRow 2: 0|0|4|64  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|8  \nRow 4: 0|0|0|32  \n\n\n### **LEFT Move Analysis**  \nWhen swiping left, tiles shift to the left, and adjacent equal tiles merge.  \n\n- **Row 1**: `32|0|32|16` → Tiles shift left, merging the two 32s into 64. Result: `64|16|0|0` (score +64).  \n- **Row 2**: `0|0|4|64` → Tiles shift left. Result: `4|64|0|0` (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: `0|0|0|8` → Tiles shift left. Result: `8|0|0|0` (no merge).  \n- **Row 4**: `0|0|0|32` → Tiles shift left. Result: `32|0|0|0` (no merge).  \n\nAfter LEFT, the board becomes:  \n64|16|0|0  \n4|64|0|0  \n8|0|0|0  \n32|0|0|0  \n\nThis move merges two 32s into a 64 (gaining 64 points) and consolidates larger tiles (64, 64, 32, 16, 8) on the left, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner for future merges.  \n\n\n### **RIGHT Move Analysis**  \nWhen swiping right, tiles shift to the right, and adjacent equal tiles merge.  \n\n- **Row 1**: `32|0|32|16` → Tiles shift right, but the 32s are not adjacent after shifting. Result: `0|0|64|16` (merge of 32s, score +64).  \n- **Row 2**: `0|0|4|64` → Tiles shift right. Result: `0|0|4|64` (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: `0|0|0|8` → Tiles shift right. Result: `0|0|0|8` (no merge).  \n- **Row 4**: `0|0|0|32` → Tiles shift right. Result: `0|0|0|32` (no merge).  \n\nAfter RIGHT, the board becomes:  \n0|0|64|16  \n0|0|4|64  \n0|0|0|8  \n0|0|0|32  \n\nThis move merges the 32s but leaves larger tiles scattered on the right, making future merges less strategic.  \n\n\n### **UP Move Analysis**  \nWhen swiping up, tiles shift upward, and adjacent equal tiles merge.  \n\n- **Column 1**: `32|0|0|0` → Tiles shift up (no change, already at the top).  \n- **Column 2**: `0|0|0|0` → No tiles to shift.  \n- **Column 3**: `32|4|0|0` → Tiles shift up (no merge, 32 ≠ 4).  \n- **Column 4**: `16|64|8|32` → Tiles shift up (no merges, all distinct).  \n\nAfter UP, the board remains unchanged. No valid merges or tile movements occur, making UP an invalid move.  \n\n\n### **DOWN Move Analysis**  \nWhen swiping down, tiles shift downward, and adjacent equal tiles merge.  \n\n- **Column 1**: `32|0|0|0` → Tiles shift down (32 moves to the bottom). Result: `0|0|0|32`.  \n- **Column 2**: `0|0|0|0` → No tiles to shift.  \n- **Column 3**: `32|4|0|0` → Tiles shift down (32 and 4 move to lower rows). Result: `0|0|32|4`.  \n- **Column 4**: `16|64|8|32` → Tiles shift down (no merges, all distinct).  \n\nAfter DOWN, the board becomes:  \n0|0|0|16  \n0|0|0|64  \n0|0|32|8  \n32|0|4|32  \n\nNo merges occur, and tiles are scattered, making this move less beneficial.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe LEFT move is optimal because it merges two 32s into a 64 (gaining 64 points) and consolidates larger tiles on the left, aligning with strategic corner positioning for future merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential, tile positioning, and strategic alignment with game goals (e.g., keeping larger tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 16 | 0 | 0\nRow 1: 4 | 64 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 32 | 16 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All tiles in each row shift left to fill empty spaces.  \n   - Row 0: `64, 16, 0, 0` → No change (no merges, as 64 ≠ 16).  \n   - Row 1: `4, 64, 0, 0` → No change (no merges, as 4 ≠ 64).  \n   - Row 2: `8, 0, 0, 0` → No change (only one tile).  \n   - Row 3: `32, 16, 0, 0` → No change (no merges, as 32 ≠ 16).  \n   - **Result**: No merges, but tiles remain on the left edge, keeping larger tiles (64) in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for future merges).\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - All tiles in each row shift right to fill empty spaces.  \n   - Row 0: `64, 16, 0, 0` → Becomes `0, 0, 64, 16` (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: `4, 64, 0, 0` → Becomes `0, 0, 4, 64` (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: `8, 0, 0, 0` → Becomes `0, 0, 0, 8` (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: `32, 16, 0, 0` → Becomes `0, 0, 32, 16` (no merges).  \n   - **Result**: No merges, and larger tiles (64) are moved away from the top-left corner, which is less strategic.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - All tiles in each column shift up to fill empty spaces.  \n   - Column 0: `64, 4, 8, 32` → No change (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 1: `16, 64, 0, 16` → Becomes `16, 64, 16, 0` (no merges, as 16 ≠ 64 ≠ 16).  \n   - Columns 2-3: All zeros → No change.  \n   - **Result**: No merges, and tiles are scattered vertically, reducing strategic positioning.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - All tiles in each column shift down to fill empty spaces.  \n   - Column 0: `64, 4, 8, 32` → No change (all distinct, no merges).  \n   - Column 1: `16, 64, 0, 16` → Becomes `0, 16, 64, 16` (no merges, as 16 ≠ 64 ≠ 16).  \n   - Columns 2-3: All zeros → No change.  \n   - **Result**: No merges, and tiles are spread out vertically, which is less strategic.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile no direction triggers immediate merges, moving **LEFT** keeps larger tiles (e.g., 64 in the top-left corner) aligned with the strategic goal of concentrating large tiles in a corner. This positioning facilitates future merges and maintains a favorable grid structure.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

After LEFT, the `64` tiles remain in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for larger tiles), and the merged `32`s in Row 3 can potentially merge again with a subsequent LEFT swipe.

However, moving UP positions the new 128 in the upper middle (row 0, column 2) and retains 64 in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), which is a strategic corner for future merges. This alignment leaves more empty spaces in lower rows, allowing flexibility for new tiles to spawn and merge with existing tiles.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score through merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 4 | 128 | 16\nRow 1: 0 | 32 | 8 | 4\nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 32\nRow 3: 0 | 64 | 0 | 64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **Swipe LEFT**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left: `[0, 4, 128, 16]` → `[4, 128, 16, 0]` (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift left: `[0, 32, 8, 4]` → `[32, 8, 4, 0]` (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift left: `[0, 0, 0, 32]` → `[32, 0, 0, 0]` (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift left: `[0, 64, 0, 64]` → `[64, 64, 0, 0]`. The two 64s merge into 128, resulting in `[128, 0, 0, 0]` (score +128).\n\nAfter LEFT swipe, the 128 tile is positioned at the bottom-left corner (row 3, column 0). Column 0 now has 4 (row 0), 32 (row 1), 32 (row 2), and 128 (row 3), creating a potential future merge of the two 32s in column 0 with a subsequent UP swipe.\n\n#### **Swipe RIGHT**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right: `[0, 4, 128, 16]` → `[0, 4, 128, 16]` (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: Tiles shift right: `[0, 32, 8, 4]` → `[0, 32, 8, 4]` (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: Tiles shift right: `[0, 0, 0, 32]` → `[0, 0, 0, 32]` (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles shift right: `[0, 64, 0, 64]` → `[0, 0, 64, 64]`. The two 64s merge into 128, resulting in `[0, 0, 0, 128]` (score +128).\n\nAfter RIGHT swipe, the 128 tile is positioned at the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3). This does not create immediate opportunities for further merges in adjacent columns.\n\n#### **Swipe UP**:\n- Columns are processed top to bottom. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles only shift up but remain unmerged. This move yields no score.\n\n#### **Swipe DOWN**:\n- Columns are processed bottom to top. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column, so no merges occur. Tiles only shift down but remain unmerged. This move yields no score.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the 64s in row 3 for 128 points. However, LEFT positions the 128 in the bottom-left corner and sets up a potential future merge of 32s in column 0, aligning with the strategy of consolidating larger tiles in a corner. UP and DOWN are invalid for merging. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score through merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4|128|16|0  \nRow 1: 32|8|4|0  \nRow 2: 32|4|0|0  \nRow 3: 128|0|0|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   All non-zero tiles are already shifted left in their rows. No merges occur. Tiles remain unchanged. No score gain. Unfavorable.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right but do not merge (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). No score gain. Unfavorable.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - **Column 0**: [4, 32, 32, 128]. The two 32s merge into 64 (score +64). The 128 shifts up to row 2.  \n   - Other columns: No merges (tiles are distinct or separated by zeros).  \n   Result: Merges 32+32→64, but the 128 (largest tile) moves from row 3 (corner) to row 2. Less optimal for corner positioning.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - **Column 0**: [4, 32, 32, 128]. The two 32s merge into 64 (score +64). The 128 remains in row 3 (bottom-left corner).  \n   - **Row 3**: After shifting, tiles become [128, 4, 4, 0]. Two 4s are adjacent (columns 1 and 2), creating a future merge opportunity (if swiped left later).  \n   Result: Merges 32+32→64, keeps the 128 in the corner, and sets up potential future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is optimal because it merges tiles (gaining 64 points), keeps the largest tile (128) in the bottom-left corner (strategic for stability), and creates adjacent 4s in row 3 for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate merges, tile alignment, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|32|0|0\nRow 1: 4|128|0|0\nRow 2: 64|8|16|0\nRow 3: 128|4|4|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: `[0, 32, 0, 0]` → shifts left to `[32, 0, 0, 0]` (no merge).\n- **Row 1**: `[4, 128, 0, 0]` → shifts left to `[4, 128, 0, 0]` (no merge).\n- **Row 2**: `[64, 8, 16, 0]` → shifts left to `[64, 8, 16, 0]` (no merge).\n- **Row 3**: `[128, 4, 4, 0]` → shifts left, merging the two `4`s into `8` → `[128, 8, 0, 0]` (merge score: 8).\n\nAfter LEFT, larger tiles (128, 64, 32) remain in the left column, consolidating them in the bottom-left corner—a strategic position.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: `[0, 32, 0, 0]` → shifts right to `[0, 0, 0, 32]` (no merge).\n- **Row 1**: `[4, 128, 0, 0]` → shifts right to `[0, 0, 4, 128]` (no merge).\n- **Row 2**: `[64, 8, 16, 0]` → shifts right to `[0, 64, 8, 16]` (no merge).\n- **Row 3**: `[128, 4, 4, 0]` → shifts right, merging the two `4`s into `8` → `[0, 128, 8, 0]` (merge score: 8).\n\nAfter RIGHT, larger tiles (128, 64) are spread across columns, reducing corner consolidation.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed upward. All tiles in columns are unique (e.g., Column 0: `[0, 4, 64, 128]`; Column 1: `[32, 128, 8, 4]`), so no merges occur. Tiles shift up but remain unmerged, with no score gain.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed downward. All tiles in columns are unique (e.g., Column 0: `[0, 4, 64, 128]`; Column 1: `[32, 128, 8, 4]`), so no merges occur. Tiles shift down but remain unmerged, with no score gain.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the `4`s in Row 3, but LEFT consolidates larger tiles (128, 64, 32) in the left column (bottom-left corner), a strategic position for future merges. UP and DOWN do not merge any tiles, making them suboptimal.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement. The goal is to maximize score and position larger tiles advantageously.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 32|0|0|0\nRow 1: 4|128|0|0\nRow 2: 64|8|16|0\nRow 3: 128|8|32|0\n```\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n#### LEFT:\n- Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur. The board remains mostly unchanged. **No score gain.**\n\n#### RIGHT:\n- Tiles shift right, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row. No merges occur. The board remains mostly unchanged. **No score gain.**\n\n#### UP:\n- Tiles shift upward. Key observation: Column 1 (values: `0, 128, 8, 8`) contains two adjacent 8s. When shifting up:\n  - Non-zero tiles in Column 1: `128, 8, 8`.\n  - These shift upward, with the two 8s merging into 16 (score +16).\n  - Resulting Column 1: `128 (row0), 16 (row1), 0 (row2), 0 (row3)`.\n- Other columns (0, 2, 3) have no merges but shift tiles upward. \n- Post-UP board:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 32|128|16|0\n  Row 1: 4|16|32|0\n  Row 2: 64|0|0|0\n  Row 3: 128|0|0|0\n  ```\n- **Score gain: 16.**\n\n#### DOWN:\n- Tiles shift downward. Column 1 (values: `0, 128, 8, 8`) has two 8s, but shifting down does not align them for merging (128 blocks their movement). No merges occur in Column 1.\n- Other columns also lack merges. **No score gain.**\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nUP is the only move that triggers a merge (two 8s → 16), providing immediate score and maintaining larger tiles (e.g., 128, 64) in positions that could support future merges. LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN do not offer merging opportunities.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential, tile alignment, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 32|128|16|32  \nRow 1: 4|16|32|0  \nRow 2: 64|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 128|0|0|0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles in each row shift left, but no adjacent tiles in any row are equal (e.g., Row 0: [32, 128, 16, 32] has no merges).  \n   - No score gain, and tile positions remain mostly unchanged.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles in each row shift right. For example, Row 1 becomes [0, 4, 16, 32], and Row 2\/3 become [0, 0, 0, 64] and [0, 0, 0, 128].  \n   - No merges occur, and larger tiles (64, 128) are moved to the bottom-right corner, but no immediate merging opportunities are created.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles in each column shift up. Columns like Column 1 ([128, 16, 0, 0]) shift to [128, 16, 0, 0], with no merges.  \n   - No score gain, and tile positions remain mostly unchanged.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles in each column shift down. Key observations:  \n     - Column 3 ([32, 0, 0, 0]) shifts to [0, 0, 0, 32] (32 moves to Row 3, Column 3).  \n     - Column 2 ([16, 32, 0, 0]) shifts to [0, 0, 16, 32] (16 and 32 move to Row 2 and 3, Column 2).  \n     - After shifting, Row 3 becomes [128, 16, 32, 32], with two adjacent 32s in Columns 2 and 3.  \n   - While no merges occur in this move, the two 32s in Row 3 set up a future merge opportunity (e.g., a subsequent LEFT swipe would merge them into 64, gaining score).  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:  \nThe DOWN move positions two 32s adjacently in Row 3, creating a potential merge in the next move. This aligns with the strategy of setting up future merges while keeping larger tiles (128, 64) in the bottom-left\/center area, which is favorable for long-term progression.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The key goals are to maximize score, create empty spaces for future moves, and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 32|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 64|128|16|32  \nRow 3: 128|16|32|32  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: [32, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- Row 1: [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- Row 2: [64, 128, 16, 32] (no merges, already left-aligned).  \n- Row 3: [128, 16, 64, 0] (two 32s merge into 64, +64 score).  \n- **Result**: 7 empty spaces. Larger tiles (128 in row3, col0) remain in a corner, but no setup for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 32] (32 shifts right).  \n- Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 4] (4 shifts right).  \n- Row 2: [64, 128, 16, 32] (no merges, already right-aligned).  \n- Row 3: [0, 128, 16, 64] (two 32s merge into 64, +64 score).  \n- **Result**: 9 empty spaces (most among all moves). The 128 in row3, col1 aligns vertically with the 128 in row2, col1, setting up a potential merge of 128s (into 256) in the next move (e.g., swiping UP).  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Column 0: [32, 4, 64, 128] (no merges, already top-aligned).  \n- Column 1: [128, 16, 0, 0] (128 and 16 shift up).  \n- Column 2: [16, 32, 0, 0] (16 and 32 shift up).  \n- Column 3: [64, 0, 0, 0] (two 32s merge into 64, +64 score).  \n- **Result**: 7 empty spaces. Larger tiles (128 in row3, col0) remain in a corner, but no clear setup for future merges.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Column 0: [32, 4, 64, 128] (no merges, already bottom-aligned).  \n- Column 1: [0, 0, 128, 16] (no merges, already bottom-aligned).  \n- Column 2: [0, 0, 16, 32] (no merges, already bottom-aligned).  \n- Column 3: [0, 0, 0, 64] (two 32s merge into 64, +64 score).  \n- **Result**: 7 empty spaces. Larger tiles (128 in row3, col0) remain in a corner, but no setup for future merges.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe RIGHT move maximizes empty spaces (9), merges the 32s for +64 score, and strategically positions the 128s in row2, col1 and row3, col1 to enable a future merge (into 256) with a subsequent UP swipe. This aligns with the goal of creating opportunities for higher-scoring merges.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

This setup is more favorable for future merges and reduces disruption from new tiles spawning in empty top rows.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities while keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|32\nRow 1: 16|0|0|4\nRow 2: 0|0|0|32\nRow 3: 128|256|32|64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift to the right. Most rows (e.g., Row 0, Row 2) remain unchanged as they only have one non-zero tile. Row 1 becomes `0|0|16|4`, and Row 3 remains `128|256|32|64` (no zeros to shift into). No merges occur, and this move does not meaningfully reposition tiles.\n\n2. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift upward. Columns are processed:  \n   - Column 0: `[0,16,0,128]` → shifts to `[16,128,0,0]`.  \n   - Column 1: `[0,0,0,256]` → shifts to `[256,0,0,0]`.  \n   - Column 2: `[0,0,0,32]` → shifts to `[32,0,0,0]`.  \n   - Column 3: `[32,4,32,64]` → no shifts (no zeros).  \n   After shifting, the grid becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 16|256|32|32  \n   Row 1: 128|0|0|4  \n   Row 2: 0|0|0|32  \n   Row 3: 0|0|0|64  \n   ```  \n   While Row 0 has adjacent 32s, merging only occurs in the direction of the swipe (up\/down affects columns, not rows). No merges happen here, and larger tiles (128, 256) are moved upward, which is suboptimal.\n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift downward. Columns are processed:  \n   - Column 0: `[0,16,0,128]` → shifts to `[0,0,16,128]`.  \n   - Column 1: `[0,0,0,256]` → remains `[0,0,0,256]`.  \n   - Column 2: `[0,0,0,32]` → remains `[0,0,0,32]`.  \n   - Column 3: `[32,4,32,64]` → no shifts (no zeros).  \n   This move does not create meaningful merges and leaves larger tiles (128, 256) in the bottom row but does not improve their positioning.\n\n4. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift to the left. Rows are processed:  \n   - Row 0: `[0,0,0,32]` → shifts to `[32,0,0,0]`.  \n   - Row 1: `[16,0,0,4]` → shifts to `[16,4,0,0]`.  \n   - Row 2: `[0,0,0,32]` → shifts to `[32,0,0,0]`.  \n   - Row 3: `[128,256,32,64]` → no shifts (no zeros).  \n   After shifting, the grid becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 32|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 16|4|0|0  \n   Row 2: 32|0|0|0  \n   Row 3: 128|256|32|64  \n   ```  \n   This move keeps larger tiles (128, 256, 64) in the bottom row (a strategic corner), creates empty spaces on the right for future tile spawns, and positions 32s in Rows 0 and 2 (Column 0) for potential future merging if followed by an up\/down swipe.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe LEFT swipe is optimal as it preserves larger tiles in the bottom row, creates empty spaces for future moves, and positions smaller tiles for potential merging in subsequent steps.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

No merges occur, and the board remains unchanged except for potential new tile placement (2 or 4) in empty right positions. This move does not create new merging opportunities.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: `32|0|0|0` → shifts right to `0|0|0|32`.  \n   - Row 1: `16|4|2|0` → shifts right to `0|16|4|2`.  \n   - Row 2: `32|0|0|0` → shifts right to `0|0|0|32`.  \n   - Row 3: `128|256|32|64` (already right-aligned, no change).  \n\n   After this move, the 32s in Row 0 and Row 2 are now in Column 3, and Row 1’s 16, 4, 2 shift right, freeing Column 0 (Row 1) to be empty. This creates space for potential future merges of the 32s in Column 3 or Column 0.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles in columns shift upward, but no merges occur. Larger tiles (e.g., 256 in Row 3, Column 1) are moved upward, disrupting their placement in the bottom row, which is suboptimal for strategic tile grouping.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles in columns shift downward, but no merges occur. The bottom row (Row 3) remains unchanged, but other rows shift downward without creating new merging opportunities.\n\n### Strategic Rationale:\nThe RIGHT swipe is the best choice because it repositions smaller tiles (16, 4, 2 in Row 1) to the right, freeing up space in Column 0 (Row 1). This allows the 32s in Row 0 and Row 2 (Column 0) to potentially align vertically in future moves, enabling a merge. Additionally, larger tiles in the bottom row (128, 256, 32, 64) remain undisturbed, maintaining a strong foundation for future high-value merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 32  \nRow 1: 0 | 16 | 4 | 2  \nRow 2: 16 | 0 | 0 | 32  \nRow 3: 128 | 256 | 32 | 64  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### 1.

RIGHT  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,0,32] → already right-aligned (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0,16,4,2] → shifts to [0,16,4,2] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [16,0,0,32] → shifts to [0,0,16,32] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: [128,256,32,64] → already right-aligned (no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges, no score gain.  \n\n\n#### 3. UP  \n- **Column 0**: [0,0,16,128] → shifts to [16,128,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,16,0,256] → shifts to [16,256,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [0,4,0,32] → shifts to [4,32,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [32,2,32,64] → no shifts (no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges, no score gain.  \n\n\n#### 4. DOWN  \n- **Column 0**: [0,0,16,128] → no shifts (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [0,16,0,256] → 16 (Row 1) shifts down to Row 2 → [0,0,16,256].  \n- **Column 2**: [0,4,0,32] → 4 (Row 1) shifts down to Row 2 → [0,0,4,32].  \n- **Column 3**: [32,2,32,64] → no shifts (no merges).  \n\nAfter shifting, **Row 2** becomes [16 (original), 16 (from Column 1), 4 (from Column 2), 32]. Here, the two adjacent 16s merge into 32, adding 32 to the score.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nOnly the **DOWN** move results in a merge (two 16s merging into 32), increasing the score. Other directions do not trigger merges.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges and set up future opportunities.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 8 | 32  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 2  \nRow 2: 16 | 16 | 4 | 32  \nRow 3: 128 | 256 | 32 | 64  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [0, 0, 8, 32] → Shifts left to [8, 32, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 0, 2] → Shifts left to [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [16, 16, 4, 32] → Shifts left, merging the two 16s into 32. Result: [32, 4, 32, 0] (merges 16+16=32, +32 score).  \n- **Row 3**: [128, 256, 32, 64] → No merges (all distinct), remains [128, 256, 32, 64].  \n\n**Key Advantage**: After merging 16s in Row 2, a 32 appears in Row 2, Column 2. This 32 aligns vertically with the 32 in Row 3, Column 2, creating a future merge opportunity (e.g., via a DOWN swipe).  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [0, 0, 8, 32] → Already right-aligned, remains [0, 0, 8, 32] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 0, 2] → Already right-aligned, remains [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [16, 16, 4, 32] → Shifts right, merging the two 16s into 32. Result: [0, 32, 4, 32] (merges 16+16=32, +32 score).  \n- **Row 3**: [128, 256, 32, 64] → No merges (all distinct), remains [128, 256, 32, 64].  \n\n**Limitation**: The merged 32 in Row 2, Column 1 does not align with any other tiles for immediate or future merges.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed top-to-bottom. No adjacent equal tiles are found in any column after shifting, so no merges occur.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed bottom-to-top. No adjacent equal tiles are found in any column after shifting, so no merges occur.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT swipe merges the 16s in Row 2, gaining 32 points, and strategically positions a 32 in Row 2, Column 2—directly above another 32 in Row 3, Column 2. This setup enables a future merge (e.g., via DOWN swipe), making LEFT the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges and set up future opportunities while following strategic principles (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|32|0|0\nRow 1: 2|0|0|128\nRow 2: 32|4|32|0\nRow 3: 128|256|32|64\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). Empty spaces remain, but no score is gained. Not optimal.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). Empty spaces remain, but no score is gained. Not optimal.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Columns are processed upward. In Column 2 (0, 0, 32, 32), the two 32s merge into 64 (score +64). However, the merged 64 is placed in Row 0, and larger tiles (e.g., 256) are scattered, making future merges less likely.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Columns are processed downward. In Column 2 (0, 0, 32, 32), the two 32s merge into 64 (score +64). Additionally, after merging, Row 3 becomes [128, 256, 64, 64]. The 64s in Row 3, Columns 2 and 3 are adjacent horizontally, setting up a potential merge with a subsequent RIGHT swipe. This positions larger tiles (128, 256) in the bottom row (a corner area), aligning with strategic goals.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nDOWN is the best move, as it merges tiles for immediate score and positions smaller tiles (64s) in a row for future merges, while keeping larger tiles in the bottom row.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize score through tile merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 8 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 2 | 32 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 32 | 4 | 4 | 128  \nRow 3: 128 | 256 | 64 | 64  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Move:\n#### **UP** and **DOWN**:  \n- **UP**: Processing columns top-to-bottom, no merges occur (all tiles in columns are distinct). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n- **DOWN**: Processing columns bottom-to-top, no merges occur (all tiles in columns are distinct). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \nBoth UP and DOWN yield 0 score and do not improve tile positioning.  \n\n\n#### **LEFT**:  \n- **Row 0**: [8, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift left, no merges (row becomes [8, 0, 0, 0]).  \n- **Row 1**: [2, 32, 0, 0] → Tiles shift left, no merges (row remains [2, 32, 0, 0]).  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 4, 4, 128] → 4s merge into 8 (score +8), row becomes [32, 8, 128, 0].  \n- **Row 3**: [128, 256, 64, 64] → 64s merge into 128 (score +128), row becomes [128, 256, 128, 0].  \n**Total Score Gain**: 8 + 128 = 136.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**:  \n- **Row 0**: [8, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right, no merges (row becomes [0, 0, 0, 8]).  \n- **Row 1**: [2, 32, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right, no merges (row becomes [0, 0, 2, 32]).  \n- **Row 2**: [32, 4, 4, 128] → 4s merge into 8 (score +8), row becomes [0, 32, 8, 128].  \n- **Row 3**: [128, 256, 64, 64] → 64s merge into 128 (score +128), row becomes [128, 256, 0, 128].  \n**Total Score Gain**: 8 + 128 = 136.  \n\n\n### Strategic Considerations:  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield the same score, but RIGHT offers better long-term positioning:  \n- **Corner Tiles**: After RIGHT, the 8 in Row 0 shifts to the rightmost column (corner), and the merged 128 in Row 3 shifts to the rightmost column (corner). Larger tiles in corners align with the strategy of consolidating high-value tiles.  \n- **Future Merges**: The 128 in Row 2 (Column 3) and 128 in Row 3 (Column 3) become vertically adjacent, creating a potential merge opportunity with a subsequent DOWN move.  \n\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 8  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 2 | 32  \nRow 2: 0 | 32 | 8 | 128  \nRow 3: 4 | 128 | 256 | 128  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- Each row shifts left, but no adjacent tiles merge (all tiles are distinct or separated by zeros).  \n- Result: No merges, minimal tile movement. Poor for scoring.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- Each row shifts right, but no adjacent tiles merge (all tiles are distinct or separated by zeros).  \n- Result: No merges, minimal tile movement. Poor for scoring.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- Columns shift upward. Only Column 3 has potential merges:  \n  - Column 3 (tiles: 8, 32, 128, 128) → 128 (row 2) and 128 (row 3) merge into 256 (row 2), with row 3 becoming 0.  \n- Result: Merges 128+128=256 (score +256). However, the merged 256 ends up in row 2, column 3, leaving larger tiles (e.g., 256 in row 3, column 2) spread out.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- Columns shift downward. Only Column 3 has potential merges:  \n  - Column 3 (tiles: 8, 32, 128, 128) → 128 (row 2) and 128 (row 3) merge into 256 (row 3), with row 0 and 1 shifting down.  \n- Result: Merges 128+128=256 (score +256). Importantly, the merged 256 ends up in row 3, column 3, adjacent to the existing 256 in row 3, column 2. This positions the two 256s to potentially merge into 512 in a subsequent LEFT swipe, maximizing future scoring potential.\n\n\n### Conclusion  \nDOWN is optimal because it merges the 128s in Column 3, scores 256, and aligns the 256s in row 3 for future merging.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|2|8  \nRow 2: 0|32|8|32  \nRow 3: 4|128|256|256  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros, remains unchanged.  \n- **Row 1**: [2, 0, 2, 8] → 2 and 2 merge into 4 (score +4), resulting in [4, 8, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 2**: [0, 32, 8, 32] → Tiles shift left but no merges (32s are not adjacent after shifting), resulting in [32, 8, 32, 0].  \n- **Row 3**: [4, 128, 256, 256] → 256 and 256 merge into 512 (score +512), resulting in [4, 128, 512, 0].  \n**Total Score Gain**: 4 + 512 = 516.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros, remains unchanged.  \n- **Row 1**: [2, 0, 2, 8] → 2 and 2 merge into 4 (score +4), shifting right to [0, 0, 8, 4].  \n- **Row 2**: [0, 32, 8, 32] → 32 and 32 merge into 64 (score +64), shifting right to [0, 8, 64, 0].  \n- **Row 3**: [4, 128, 256, 256] → 256 and 256 merge into 512 (score +512), shifting right to [0, 4, 128, 512].  \n**Total Score Gain**: 4 + 64 + 512 = 580.  \n\n\n#### **UP\/DOWN Swipes**:\n- **UP**: Tiles in columns shift upward, but no adjacent equal tiles to merge (e.g., Column 0: [0, 2, 0, 4] → [2, 4, 0, 0]; Column 1: [0, 0, 32, 128] → [32, 128, 0, 0]; no merges).  \n- **DOWN**: Tiles in columns shift downward, but no adjacent equal tiles to merge (e.g., Column 0: [0, 2, 0, 4] → [0, 0, 2, 4]; Column 1: [0, 0, 32, 128] → [0, 0, 32, 128]; no merges).  \n**Total Score Gain**: 0 for both.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT swipe yields the highest score gain (580) due to merging 2s, 32s, and 256s. It also positions larger tiles (512, 64) on the right edge, which is strategic for future merges.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities, tile positioning, and strategic alignment of large tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|8|0\nRow 1: 0|0|4|8\nRow 2: 0|32|8|32\nRow 3: 0|4|128|512\n```\nKey observations:\n- The largest tile, 512, is in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), which is ideal for maintaining a corner strategy.\n- 128 is adjacent to 512 (row 3, column 2), supporting the corner cluster.\n- There are two 32s in row 2 (columns 1 and 3) and two 8s in row 0 (column 2) and row 2 (column 2).\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### LEFT:\n- Tiles shift left in each row. \n- Row 0 becomes [8,0,0,0], row 1 becomes [4,8,0,0], row 2 becomes [32,8,32,0], row 3 becomes [4,128,512,0].\n- No merges occur. \n- 512 moves from column 3 to column 2 (no longer in the corner), which is strategically poor.\n\n#### RIGHT:\n- Tiles shift right in each row. \n- Row 0 becomes [0,0,0,8] (8 moves to column 3), row 1 remains [0,0,4,8] (no change), row 2 remains [0,32,8,32] (no change), row 3 remains [0,4,128,512] (no change).\n- No merges occur. \n- 512 stays in the bottom-right corner (column 3). \n- The 8 in row 0, column 2 shifts to row 0, column 3, aligning vertically with the 8 in row 1, column 3. This sets up a potential merge (8+8=16) with a future DOWN swipe.\n\n#### UP:\n- Tiles shift up in each column. \n- Column 1 (0,0,32,4) becomes [32,4,0,0], column 2 (8,4,8,128) remains [8,4,8,128], column 3 (0,8,32,512) becomes [8,32,512,0].\n- No merges occur. \n- 512 moves from row 3, column 3 to row 2, column 3 (no longer in the corner), which is strategically poor.\n\n#### DOWN:\n- Tiles shift down in each column. \n- Columns remain largely unchanged (tiles are already as far down as possible). \n- No merges occur. \n- 512 stays in the bottom-right corner, but the 8 in row 0, column 2 does not align with other 8s for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT is the best move.

This scatters smaller tiles into the top row, potentially blocking future merges in lower rows.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift downward in each column.  \n   - Column 0: `[0,0,0,8]` → `[0,0,0,8]`.  \n   - Column 1: `[0,2,32,4]` → `[0,2,32,4]`.  \n   - Column 2: `[0,4,8,128]` → `[0,4,8,128]`.  \n   - Column 3: `[0,16,32,512]` → `[0,16,32,512]`.  \n   - **Result**: No merges, with empty spaces in Row 0 (4 empty), Row 1 (col0), and Row 2 (col0). Similar to RIGHT swipe, new tiles may spawn in lower rows, risking blockage.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nLEFT swipe is preferred because it leaves most empty spaces in Row 0, where new tiles are less likely to block the larger tiles (512, 128, 32, 16) concentrated in the lower-right corner. This maintains a favorable structure for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize future merging opportunities and maintain larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 32|0|0|0\nRow 1: 2|4|16|0\nRow 2: 32|8|32|0\nRow 3: 8|4|128|512\n```\nKey observations:\n- The largest tile (512) is in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), an ideal position.\n- The 128 tile is adjacent to 512 (row 3, column 2), which is strategically valuable.\n- There are 3 empty tiles (row 0: columns 1-3; row 1: column 3; row 2: column 3).\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### LEFT:\n- All rows are already shifted left with no merges or empty spaces to fill. No tiles move, so this is an invalid move.\n\n#### RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: 32 shifts right to column 3 → `0|0|0|32`.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles 2, 4, 16 shift right to fill the empty column 3 → `0|2|4|16`.\n- **Row 2**: Tiles 32, 8, 32 shift right to fill the empty column 3 → `0|32|8|32`.\n- **Row 3**: No movement (already right-aligned).  \nThis move is valid, as tiles shift into empty spaces. The 512 remains in the bottom-right corner, preserving a strong corner position. The 32s in row 2 (columns 1 and 3) could merge in future moves if the 8 between them is cleared.\n\n#### UP:\n- **Column 0**: 32, 2, 32, 8 (no merging, no movement).\n- **Column 1**: 0, 4, 8, 4 → shifts up to `4|8|4|0`.\n- **Column 2**: 0, 16, 32, 128 → shifts up to `16|32|128|0`.\n- **Column 3**: 0, 0, 0, 512 → shifts up to `512|0|0|0`.  \nThis move is valid but moves the 512 from the bottom-right to the top-right corner, disrupting its ideal position. The 128 (row 3, column 2) is no longer adjacent to 512, reducing future merging potential.\n\n#### DOWN:\n- All columns are already shifted down with no merges or empty spaces to fill. No tiles move, so this is an invalid move.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe RIGHT move preserves the 512 in the bottom-right corner (optimal corner position) and shifts smaller tiles to create future merging opportunities (e.g., the 32s in row 2). UP disrupts the 512’s position, and LEFT\/DOWN are invalid. Thus, RIGHT is the best choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and the goal of merging tiles to maximize scores while strategically positioning larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|0|0|32\nRow 1: 0|2|4|16\nRow 2: 0|32|8|32\nRow 3: 8|4|128|512\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**:\n- Row 0: [16, 0, 0, 32] → Shifts to [16, 32, 0, 0] (no merge).\n- Row 1: [0, 2, 4, 16] → Shifts to [2, 4, 16, 0] (no merge).\n- Row 2: [0, 32, 8, 32] → Shifts to [32, 8, 32, 0] (no merge).\n- Row 3: [8, 4, 128, 512] → No change (no merge).  \n**Result**: No merges, minimal tile movement.\n\n#### **RIGHT**:\n- Row 0: [16, 0, 0, 32] → Shifts to [0, 0, 16, 32] (no merge).\n- Row 1: [0, 2, 4, 16] → No change (no merge).\n- Row 2: [0, 32, 8, 32] → No change (no merge).\n- Row 3: [8, 4, 128, 512] → No change (no merge).  \n**Result**: No merges, no meaningful movement.\n\n#### **UP**:\n- Column 0: [16, 0, 0, 8] → Shifts to [16, 8, 0, 0] (no merge).\n- Column 1: [0, 2, 32, 4] → Shifts to [2, 32, 4, 0] (no merge).\n- Column 2: [0, 4, 8, 128] → Shifts to [4, 8, 128, 0] (no merge).\n- Column 3: [32, 16, 32, 512] → No change (no merge).  \n**Result**: No merges, minimal tile movement.\n\n#### **DOWN**:\n- Column 0: [16, 0, 0, 8] → Shifts to [0, 0, 16, 8] (no merge).\n- Column 1: [0, 2, 32, 4] → No change (no merge).\n- Column 2: [0, 4, 8, 128] → No change (no merge).\n- Column 3: [32, 16, 32, 512] → Shifts down, merging the two 32s into 64 (score +64).  \n**Result**: Merges two 32s into 64, increasing the score and keeping larger tiles (e.g., 512, 128) in the bottom row (corner-aligned).\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move as it enables a merge (32 + 32 = 64), increases the score, and maintains larger tiles in a strategic corner position.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|4|32  \nRow 1: 0|2|4|16  \nRow 2: 16|32|8|32  \nRow 3: 8|4|128|512  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Row 0: [0,0,4,32] → [4,32,0,0] (no merges).  \n- Row 1: [0,2,4,16] → [2,4,16,0] (no merges).  \n- Row 2: [16,32,8,32] → [16,32,8,32] (no merges).  \n- Row 3: [8,4,128,512] → [8,4,128,512] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: No merges, minimal tile movement.  \n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Row 0: [0,0,4,32] → [0,0,4,32] (no movement).  \n- Row 1: [0,2,4,16] → [0,2,4,16] (no movement).  \n- Row 2: [16,32,8,32] → [16,32,8,32] (no merges).  \n- Row 3: [8,4,128,512] → [8,4,128,512] (no movement).  \n- **Result**: No merges, no meaningful changes.  \n\n#### **UP**  \n- Column 0: [0,0,16,8] → [16,8,0,0] (no merges).  \n- Column 1: [0,2,32,4] → [2,32,4,0] (no merges).  \n- Column 2: [4,4,8,128] → [8,8,128,0] (merges 4+4=8, score +8).  \n- Column 3: [32,16,32,512] → [32,16,32,512] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: Only one merge (score +8), limited tile rearrangement.  \n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Column 0: [0,0,16,8] → [0,0,16,8] (no merges).  \n- Column 1: [0,2,32,4] → [0,2,32,4] (no merges).  \n- Column 2: [4,4,8,128] → [0,0,16,128] (merges 4+4=8, then 8+8=16, score +24).  \n- Column 3: [32,16,32,512] → [32,16,32,512] (no merges).  \n- **Result**: Two merges (score +24), preserves large tiles (128, 512) in the bottom row, and creates empty spaces in upper rows for future moves.  \n\n### Conclusion  \nDOWN is the best move, as it generates the highest score (24) through two merges, maintains large tiles in the bottom row (strategically favorable), and creates empty spaces for future flexibility.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

Maintaining these in the corner is strategic.\n- No immediate merges are possible in any row or column with the current tile arrangement. The priority shifts to creating empty spaces for future moves and preserving the corner for large tiles.\n\n### Direction Evaluation:\n1. **LEFT**: Tiles shift left. No merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). The board remains mostly unchanged, with minimal empty spaces created.\n2. **RIGHT**: Tiles shift right.

Larger tiles (512, 128, 64) remain in the bottom row, aligning with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in a corner.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score through merges while strategically positioning larger tiles (especially the 512 in the bottom-right corner).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 32 | 16 | 32\nRow 1: 64 | 2 | 8 | 16\nRow 2: 16 | 32 | 16 | 32\nRow 3: 8 | 4 | 128 | 512\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The largest tile (512) is in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3). Strategic moves should avoid disrupting this position.\n- The only immediate merges are in column 0, where two 64s (row 0 and row 1) can merge into 128, yielding 128 points.\n\n\n### Direction Evaluation:\n#### LEFT\/RIGHT:\n- No merges occur in any row. Tiles remain in their current positions as no adjacent duplicates exist. These directions provide no score and are not useful.\n\n#### UP:\n- **Column 0**: The two 64s (row 0 and row 1) merge into 128. The 16 (row 2) and 8 (row 3) shift up, leaving an empty tile in row 3, column 0.\n- Other columns: No merges (no adjacent duplicates after shifting).\n- Resulting board after UP:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 128 | 32 | 16 | 32\n  Row 1: 16 | 2 | 8 | 16\n  Row 2: 8 | 32 | 16 | 32\n  Row 3: 0 | 4 | 128 | 512\n  ```\n- The empty tile (row 3, column 0) may spawn a new 2 or 4. If a 4 spawns here, the bottom row becomes `4 | 4 | 128 | 512`, allowing a future LEFT swipe to merge the 4s into 8.\n\n#### DOWN:\n- **Column 0**: The two 64s (row 0 and row 1) merge into 128, but they shift down, leaving an empty tile in row 0, column 0.\n- Other columns: No merges (no adjacent duplicates after shifting).\n- Resulting board after DOWN:\n  ```\n  Row 0: 0 | 32 | 16 | 32\n  Row 1: 128 | 2 | 8 | 16\n  Row 2: 16 | 32 | 16 | 32\n  Row 3: 8 | 4 | 128 | 512\n  ```\n- The empty tile (row 0, column 0) is less strategic, as new tiles here are unlikely to contribute to future merges near the critical bottom-right corner.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is better because it merges the 64s into 128 (scoring 128) and leaves an empty tile in the bottom row (row 3, column 0), which can potentially enable a merge of 4s in the next move if a 4 spawns there. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in the bottom-right corner and setting up future merges.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of moving LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize merges, create future opportunities, and maintain larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 128|32|16|32  \nRow 1: 16|2|8|16  \nRow 2: 8|32|16|32  \nRow 3: 8|4|128|512  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT Moves**:  \n   - **LEFT**: All rows are already fully occupied with no adjacent equal tiles to merge. No tiles shift or merge, making this an invalid move.  \n   - **RIGHT**: Similarly, all rows are fully occupied with no adjacent equal tiles to merge. No tiles shift or merge, making this an invalid move.  \n\n2. **UP Move**:  \n   - **Column 0** (128, 16, 8, 8): The two 8s in rows 2 and 3 merge into 16 (score +16). The merged 16 moves to row 2, leaving row 3, column 0 empty.  \n   - Other columns (1, 2, 3) have no adjacent equal tiles to merge, so they remain unchanged.  \n   - Result: Creates an empty space in row 3, column 0 but does not set up future merges for adjacent tiles.  \n\n3. **DOWN Move**:  \n   - **Column 0** (128, 16, 8, 8): The two 8s in rows 2 and 3 merge into 16 (score +16). The 16 from row 1 shifts down to row 2, and the 128 from row 0 shifts down to row 1, leaving row 0, column 0 empty.  \n   - After merging, column 0 becomes [0, 128, 16, 16], with 16s in rows 2 and 3 (adjacent), setting up a potential merge for the next move.  \n   - Other columns (1, 2, 3) remain unchanged as they have no adjacent equal tiles.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN move merges two 8s into 16, creates an empty space, and sets up adjacent 16s in column 0 for future merging. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles (e.g., 512 in the bottom-right corner) in corners and creating opportunities for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate potential merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges and strategically position larger tiles (e.g., 512 in the bottom-right corner).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8 | 32 | 16 | 32\nRow 1: 128 | 2 | 8 | 16\nRow 2: 16 | 32 | 16 | 32\nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 128 | 512\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   - Swiping LEFT or RIGHT does not trigger any merges. All rows have distinct adjacent tiles (e.g., Row 0: 8, 32, 16, 32; Row 1: 128, 2, 8, 16), so tiles remain in place with no empty spaces to shift into. No score is gained, and the board remains unchanged. These moves are ineffective.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - Swiping UP processes columns from top to bottom. In Column 0 (8, 128, 16, 16), the two 16s (Row 2 and Row 3) merge into 32, yielding 32 points. The merged column becomes [8, 128, 32, 0] (Row 3, Column 0 is empty). Other columns (1-3) have no merges due to non-adjacent or distinct tiles. A new tile (2\/4) will spawn in the empty spot (Row 3, Column 0).\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Swiping DOWN processes columns from bottom to top. In Column 0 (8, 128, 16, 16), the two 16s (Row 2 and Row 3) merge into 32, yielding 32 points. The merged column becomes [8, 128, 0, 32] (Row 2, Column 0 is empty). Other columns (1-3) have no merges. A new tile (2\/4) will spawn in the empty spot (Row 2, Column 0).\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe largest tile (512) is in the bottom-right corner, a strong position. Swiping DOWN places the merged 32 in Row 3, Column 0 (bottom row), aligning it with the 128 (Row 3, Column 2) and 512 (Row 3, Column 3) in the bottom row. This supports future merges by keeping larger tiles in the same row, whereas UP places the 32 in Row 2, Column 0 (third row), which is less aligned with the bottom row’s large tiles.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 32|32|16|32  \nRow 1: 8|2|8|16  \nRow 2: 128|32|16|32  \nRow 3: 32|4|128|512  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles [32, 32, 16, 32] shift left. The first two 32s merge into 64 (score +64). Result: 64|16|32|0.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [8, 2, 8, 16] have no adjacent duplicates. Result: 8|2|8|16 (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [128, 32, 16, 32] have no adjacent duplicates. Result: 128|32|16|32 (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [32, 4, 128, 512] have no adjacent duplicates. Result: 32|4|128|512 (no merge).  \n\n**Outcome**: Merges 32s in Row 0 for 64 points, leaves an empty space in Row 0, Column 3.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles [32, 32, 16, 32] shift right. The last two 32s (after shifting) merge into 64 (score +64). Result: 0|64|16|32.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles [8, 2, 8, 16] have no adjacent duplicates. Result: 8|2|8|16 (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles [128, 32, 16, 32] have no adjacent duplicates. Result: 128|32|16|32 (no merge).  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles [32, 4, 128, 512] have no adjacent duplicates. Result: 32|4|128|512 (no merge).  \n\n**Outcome**: Merges 32s in Row 0 for 64 points, leaves an empty space in Row 0, Column 0.\n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- All columns (e.g., Column 0: [32, 8, 128, 32], Column 1: [32, 2, 32, 4]) have no adjacent duplicates. No merges occur.  \n\n**Outcome**: 0 points, no changes to tile positions.\n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- All columns (e.g., Column 0: [32, 8, 128, 32], Column 1: [32, 2, 32, 4]) have no adjacent duplicates. No merges occur.  \n\n**Outcome**: 0 points, no changes to tile positions.  \n\n\n### Decision:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 64 points, but LEFT is preferable. Merging the leftmost 32s in Row 0 keeps the 512 (largest tile) in the bottom-right corner (Row 3, Column 3), a strategic position. The empty space left in Row 0, Column 3 is less likely to disrupt the 512 corner compared to the empty space in Row 0, Column 0 (RIGHT swipe).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 16 | 32 | 32\nRow 1: 8  | 2  | 8  | 16\nRow 2: 128| 32 | 16 | 32\nRow 3: 32 | 4  | 128| 512\n```\nThe largest tile is 512 in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), a strong position to protect. The key goal is to merge tiles to increase the score while keeping larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Swipe Analysis:\n1. **UP\/DOWN Swipes**:  \n   - Columns are processed, but no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. For example, column 3 has 32 (row 0), 16 (row 1), 32 (row 2), 512 (row 3), but the 32s are separated by 16 and cannot merge. No merges occur with UP or DOWN.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles [64, 16, 32, 32] shift right. The two 32s (columns 2 and 3) merge into 64, resulting in [0, 64, 16, 64]. Score: 64.  \n   - Other rows (1-3) have no adjacent equal tiles, so no merges.  \n\n3. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles [64, 16, 32, 32] shift left. The two 32s (columns 2 and 3) merge into 64, resulting in [64, 16, 64, 0]. Score: 64.  \n   - Other rows (1-3) have no adjacent equal tiles, so no merges.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT swipes merge the 32s in row 0 for a score of 64. However, **LEFT** is preferred because:  \n- Merging left keeps the new 64 (from merged 32s) in column 2 of row 0, aligning with the existing 64 in column 0 of row 0. This positions two 64s in the same row (separated by 16), which could enable future merges if the 16 is moved.  \n- The empty tile after LEFT (row 0, column 3) is less likely to interfere with the 512 in the bottom-right corner compared to the empty tile after RIGHT (row 0, column 0), which is farther from the critical corner.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile movement.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64|16|64|16\nRow 1: 8|2|8|16\nRow 2: 128|32|16|32\nRow 3: 32|4|128|512\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT\/RIGHT**:\n- **LEFT**: All rows are fully occupied with no adjacent equal tiles. No merging or movement occurs. Invalid move.\n- **RIGHT**: All rows are fully occupied with no adjacent equal tiles. No merging or movement occurs. Invalid move.\n\n#### **UP**:\n- Column 3 (values: 16, 16, 32, 512) has adjacent 16s (row 0 and row 1). These merge into 32 (score +32). The 32 (row 2) shifts up to row 1, and 512 (row 3) shifts up to row 2. The resulting column 3 becomes [32, 32, 512, 0]. No further merges occur in this move. Other columns have no merges or movement. Valid but limited merging.\n\n#### **DOWN**:\n- Column 3 (values: 16, 16, 32, 512) has adjacent 16s (row 0 and row 1). These merge into 32 (score +32) and shift down to row 1. The 32 (row 1) now aligns with the 32 (row 2), merging into 64 (score +64) and shifting down to row 2. The 512 (row 3) remains. The resulting column 3 becomes [0, 0, 64, 512]. This move triggers two merges (16→32 and 32→64), yielding 96 points. Other columns have no merges or movement, but the move is valid due to tile shifts.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move, as it enables two merges (16→32 and 32→64) for a higher score, while LEFT\/RIGHT are invalid and UP provides fewer merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up for future merges, particularly keeping large tiles in corners.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 64 | 16 | 64 | 64\nRow 1: 8 | 2 | 8 | 32\nRow 2: 128 | 32 | 16 | 32\nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 128 | 512\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles [64, 16, 64, 64] shift left. The two rightmost 64s merge into 128, resulting in [64, 16, 128, 0]. Score increases by 128.  \n   - Other rows (1-3) have no merges.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles [64, 16, 64, 64] shift right. The two rightmost 64s merge into 128, resulting in [0, 64, 16, 128]. Score increases by 128.  \n   - Other rows (1-3) have no merges.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - **Column 3**: Tiles [64, 32, 32, 512] shift up.

Score increases by 64.  \n   - Other columns have no merges.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - **Column 3**: Tiles [64, 32, 32, 512] shift down. The two 32s (rows 1 and 2) merge into 64, resulting in [0, 64, 64, 512]. Score increases by 64.  \n   - Other columns have no merges.  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **LEFT and RIGHT** yield the highest immediate score (128 points) from merging 64s in Row 0.  \n- **RIGHT** positions the merged 128 in Row 0, Column 3, adjacent to the 512 in Row 3, Column 3 (bottom-right corner). This aligns large tiles in the same column, facilitating future merges (e.g., potential 128+128 in Column 3).  \n- **LEFT** places the merged 128 in Row 0, Column 2, which is less strategic for corner-based growth.  \n\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

The two 8s merge into 16 → score +16.  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles are distinct (64, 2, 32, 4) → no merges.  \n- **Column 2**: Tiles are distinct (16, 8, 16, 128) → no merges.  \n- **Column 3**: Tiles [128, 32, 32, 512] shift down to [512, 32, 32, 128].

The goal is to maximize scoring potential and set up future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 64 | 16 | 64  \nRow 1: 16 | 2 | 8 | 128  \nRow 2: 128 | 32 | 16 | 64  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 128 | 512  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles in each row shift left.  \n   - Row 0: `0|64|16|64` → `64|16|64|0` (no merges).  \n   - Rows 1-3: All tiles are unique, so no merges.  \n   - Result: No merges, only one empty space (row 0, column 3) for a new tile. Poor setup for future merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles in each row shift right.  \n   - All rows have unique tiles, so no merges or movement.  \n   - Result: No valid moves (no tiles shift or merge).  \n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles in each column shift down.  \n   - All columns have unique tiles, so no merges or movement.  \n   - Result: No valid moves (no tiles shift or merge).  \n\n4. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles in each column shift up.  \n   - Column 0: `0|16|128|32` → `16|128|32|0` (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: `64|2|32|4` → `64|2|32|4` (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: `16|8|16|128` → `16|8|16|128` (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: `64|128|64|512` → `64|128|64|512` (no merges).  \n   - **Key Outcome**: After shifting up, Row 2 becomes `32|32|16|64`. The two adjacent 32s in Row 2, columns 0 and 1, set up a future merge opportunity (e.g., with a subsequent LEFT swipe, these 32s can merge into 64, increasing the score).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe is optimal because it positions two 32s adjacently in Row 2, creating a strategic setup for future merges. This improves the potential for scoring in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize merges and strategically position tiles for future moves, particularly keeping large tiles (like 512) in a corner.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 64 | 16 | 64\nRow 1: 128 | 2 | 8 | 128\nRow 2: 32 | 32 | 16 | 64\nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 128 | 512\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are already left-aligned with no merges (16, 64, 16, 64). No change.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles are left-aligned with no merges (128, 2, 8, 128). No change.\n- **Row 2**: The two 32s in columns 0 and 1 merge into 64. The row becomes: 64 | 16 | 64 | 0 (score +64).\n- **Row 3**: Tiles are left-aligned with no merges (32, 4, 128, 512). No change.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles are right-aligned with no merges (16, 64, 16, 64). No change.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles are right-aligned with no merges (128, 2, 8, 128).

No change.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles (16, 128, 32, 32) shift up. The two 32s in rows 2 and 3 merge into 64. The column becomes: 16 | 128 | 64 | 0 (score +64).\n- **Other Columns**: No merges (all tiles are distinct or non-adjacent).\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles (16, 128, 32, 32) shift down. The two 32s in rows 2 and 3 merge into 64. The column becomes: 0 | 16 | 128 | 64 (score +64).\n- **Other Columns**: No merges (all tiles are distinct or non-adjacent).\n\n### Key Observations:\nAll directions yield a single merge (32+32=64) with the same score. The decision hinges on board positioning. The largest tile (512) is in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3). Swiping LEFT leaves an empty space in row 2, column 3 (adjacent to 512), which is advantageous for future moves, as it avoids blocking the corner and allows flexibility for tile shifts.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and game rules. The goal is to identify valid moves where tiles can merge or shift into empty spaces.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 64 | 16 | 64\nRow 1: 128 | 2 | 8 | 128\nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 64 | 2\nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 128 | 512\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   All rows are already left-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges or shifts occur.  \n   - Row 0: [16, 64, 16, 64] (no movement).  \n   - Row 1: [128, 2, 8, 128] (no movement).  \n   - Row 2: [64, 16, 64, 2] (no movement).  \n   - Row 3: [32, 4, 128, 512] (no movement).  \n   **Result**: No valid moves.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right, and merges are possible in Row 1:  \n   - Row 0: [16, 64, 16, 64] (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [128, 2, 8, 128] → After shifting right, the two 128s in positions 0 and 3 become adjacent (positions 2 and 3). They merge into 256, creating empty spaces.  \n   - Row 2: [64, 16, 64, 2] (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: [32, 4, 128, 512] (no merges).  \n   **Result**: Valid move (Row 1 merges 128 + 128 = 256).\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   All columns are already top-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges or shifts occur.  \n   - Column 0: [16, 128, 64, 32] (no movement).  \n   - Column 1: [64, 2, 16, 4] (no movement).  \n   - Column 2: [16, 8, 64, 128] (no movement).  \n   - Column 3: [64, 128, 2, 512] (no movement).  \n   **Result**: No valid moves.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   All columns are already bottom-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. No merges or shifts occur.  \n   - Column 0: [16, 128, 64, 32] (no movement).  \n   - Column 1: [64, 2, 16, 4] (no movement).  \n   - Column 2: [16, 8, 64, 128] (no movement).  \n   - Column 3: [64, 128, 2, 512] (no movement).  \n   **Result**: No valid moves.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only valid move is **RIGHT**, as it allows merging the two 128s in Row 1 into a 256 tile.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and the game rules. The grid is:\n\n```\n16|64|16|64\n128|2|8|128\n64|16|64|2\n32|4|128|512\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No Empty Tiles**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no zeros), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **Adjacent Tiles**: No two adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. This means no immediate merges are possible without first shifting tiles to bring duplicates together.\n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### LEFT:\n- Each row is processed by shifting tiles left. For example:\n  - Row 1: `16|64|16|64` → No duplicates, so no merging.\n  - Row 2: `128|2|8|128` → No duplicates, so no merging.\n  - Row 3: `64|16|64|2` → No duplicates, so no merging.\n  - Row 4: `32|4|128|512` → No duplicates, so no merging.\n- **Result**: No merges occur; the grid remains unchanged.\n\n#### RIGHT:\n- Each row is processed by shifting tiles right. For example:\n  - Row 1: `16|64|16|64` → No duplicates, so no merging.\n  - Row 2: `128|2|8|128` → The two `128`s are in positions 1 and 4. Shifting right would push the left `128` past `2` and `8` to position 3, resulting in `2|8|128|128`. These `128`s would then merge into `256`, creating a new tile and a score of 256. However, upon re-evaluation, the tiles in Row 2 are `128|2|8|128`, and shifting right does not bring the `128`s adjacent (they are separated by `2` and `8`), so no merge occurs.\n  - Row 3: `64|16|64|2` → No duplicates, so no merging.\n  - Row 4: `32|4|128|512` → No duplicates, so no merging.\n- **Result**: No merges occur; the grid remains unchanged.\n\n#### UP:\n- Each column is processed by shifting tiles up. For example:\n  - Column 1: `16|128|64|32` → No duplicates, so no merging.\n  - Column 2: `64|2|16|4` → No duplicates, so no merging.\n  - Column 3: `16|8|64|128` → No duplicates, so no merging.\n  - Column 4: `64|128|2|512` → No duplicates, so no merging.\n- **Result**: No merges occur; the grid remains unchanged.\n\n#### DOWN:\n- Each column is processed by shifting tiles down. For example:\n  - Column 1: `16|128|64|32` → No duplicates, so no merging.\n  - Column 2: `64|2|16|4` → No duplicates, so no merging.\n  - Column 3: `16|8|64|128` → No duplicates, so no merging.\n  - Column 4: `64|128|2|512` → No duplicates, so no merging.\n- **Result**: No merges occur; the grid remains unchanged.\n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nSince all directions result in no merges, the choice prioritizes preserving the largest tile (`512` in row 4, column 4) in its corner. Moving RIGHT or DOWN avoids shifting the `512` tile from its position (RIGHT keeps it in column 4; DOWN keeps it in row 4). Between these, RIGHT is marginally better as it aligns with the strategy of consolidating larger tiles in corners.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. The goal is to identify if any direction allows tiles to merge or shift into empty spaces (valid moves).\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|64|16|64  \nRow 1: 128|2|8|128  \nRow 2: 64|16|64|2  \nRow 3: 32|4|128|512  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The grid has no empty tiles (0s), so all tiles are fully occupied.\n- A valid move requires either merging adjacent tiles of the same number or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same number.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \nFor each row, tiles shift left. No adjacent tiles in any row are equal (e.g., Row 0: 16, 64, 16, 64; Row 1: 128, 2, 8, 128; etc.). No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift (no empty spaces). **No valid move.**\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nFor each row, tiles shift right. Similarly, no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. Tiles cannot shift (no empty spaces). **No valid move.**\n\n#### **UP**  \nFor each column, tiles shift up. No adjacent tiles in any column are equal (e.g., Column 0: 16, 128, 64, 32; Column 1: 64, 2, 16, 4; etc.). No merges occur, and tiles cannot shift. **No valid move.**\n\n#### **DOWN**  \nFor each column, tiles shift down. Again, no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. Tiles cannot shift (no empty spaces). **No valid move.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and there are no adjacent tiles of the same number. Thus, no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the directions, we must choose arbitrarily.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The key is to identify if any moves result in merging tiles (which increases the score) or if all moves are invalid due to a full grid with no adjacent equal tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current game board is:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 64 | 16 | 64  \nRow 1: 128 | 2 | 8 | 128  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 64 | 2  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 128 | 512  \n```\nAll tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces), so the grid is full. A valid move requires either merging adjacent equal tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces. Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend on merging adjacent equal tiles.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   For each row, tiles shift left. None of the rows have adjacent equal tiles (e.g., Row 0: 16, 64, 16, 64; no adjacent pairs to merge). All rows remain unchanged. No merges occur.\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right. Similar to the left swipe, no rows have adjacent equal tiles after shifting (e.g., Row 1: 128, 2, 8, 128; no adjacent pairs to merge). All rows remain unchanged. No merges occur.\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift up. Columns are checked for adjacent equal tiles (e.g., Column 0: 16, 128, 64, 32; no adjacent pairs to merge). All columns remain unchanged. No merges occur.\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift down. Columns are checked for adjacent equal tiles (e.g., Column 3: 64, 128, 2, 512; no adjacent pairs to merge). All columns remain unchanged. No merges occur.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and there are no adjacent equal tiles in any row or column. This means no valid merges are possible for any direction. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid merges, any direction is technically invalid, but a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid and the game rules. The goal is to identify if any direction allows merging tiles or moving tiles into empty spaces (valid moves). The grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number to merge.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16|64|16|64  \nRow 1: 128|2|8|128  \nRow 2: 64|16|64|2  \nRow 3: 32|4|128|512  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \nFor each row, tiles shift left. No adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., row 0: 16,64,16,64 has no adjacent duplicates; row 1: 128,2,8,128 has no adjacent duplicates). Thus, no merges occur, and tiles remain in place. **No valid move.**\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \nFor each row, tiles shift right. Similarly, no adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., row 0: 16,64,16,64; row 1: 128,2,8,128). Tiles remain in place with no merges. **No valid move.**\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \nFor each column, tiles shift up. No adjacent tiles in any column are the same (e.g., column 0: 16,128,64,32; column 1: 64,2,16,4). Tiles remain in place with no merges. **No valid move.**\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \nFor each column, tiles shift down. No adjacent tiles in any column are the same (e.g., column 3: 64,128,2,512; column 2: 16,8,64,128). Tiles remain in place with no merges. **No valid move.**\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) fail to produce merges or move tiles into empty spaces. The grid is full with no adjacent duplicates, meaning no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and no direction is more optimal than others, a default choice is made.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate the validity of swiping left, right, up, or down based on the game rules. A valid move requires either adjacent tiles with the same number (which can merge) or empty spaces (0s) to allow tile movement. \n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 64 | 16 | 64  \nRow 1: 128 | 2 | 8 | 128  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 64 | 2  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 128 | 512  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows are already fully occupied with no empty spaces (0s).  \n   - No adjacent tiles in any row have the same number (e.g., Row 0: 16, 64, 16, 64—no adjacent duplicates; Row 1: 128, 2, 8, 128—no adjacent duplicates; etc.).  \n   - No tiles can shift left, and no merges are possible.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - All rows are fully occupied with no empty spaces.  \n   - No adjacent tiles in any row have the same number (e.g., Row 0: 16, 64, 16, 64—no adjacent duplicates; Row 1: 128, 2, 8, 128—no adjacent duplicates; etc.).  \n   - No tiles can shift right, and no merges are possible.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - All columns are fully occupied with no empty spaces.  \n   - No adjacent tiles in any column have the same number (e.g., Column 0: 16, 128, 64, 32—no adjacent duplicates; Column 1: 64, 2, 16, 4—no adjacent duplicates; etc.).  \n   - No tiles can shift up, and no merges are possible.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - All columns are fully occupied with no empty spaces.  \n   - No adjacent tiles in any column have the same number (e.g., Column 0: 16, 128, 64, 32—no adjacent duplicates; Column 1: 64, 2, 16, 4—no adjacent duplicates; etc.).  \n   - No tiles can shift down, and no merges are possible.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is completely full (no 0s), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same number in any direction. Thus, **no valid moves** exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the answer defaults to an arbitrary choice (as all directions are invalid).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid has no empty tiles (all values are non-zero), so valid moves depend on adjacent tiles merging after shifting.\n\n### Grid Analysis:\nThe current grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 16 | 64 | 16 | 64  \nRow 1: 128 | 2 | 8 | 128  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 64 | 2  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 128 | 512  \n```\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: [16, 64, 16, 64] – No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n- **Row 1**: [128, 2, 8, 128] – 128s are separated by 2 and 8; no merges.  \n- **Row 2**: [64, 16, 64, 2] – 64s are separated by 16; no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: [32, 4, 128, 512] – All distinct; no merges.  \n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: [16, 64, 16, 64] – No adjacent equal tiles; no merges.  \n- **Row 1**: [128, 2, 8, 128] – 128s are separated by 2 and 8; no merges.  \n- **Row 2**: [64, 16, 64, 2] – 64s are separated by 16; no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: [32, 4, 128, 512] – All distinct; no merges.  \n\n### UP Move:\n- **Column 0**: [16, 128, 64, 32] – All distinct; no merges.  \n- **Column 1**: [64, 2, 16, 4] – All distinct; no merges.  \n- **Column 2**: [16, 8, 64, 128] – All distinct; no merges.  \n- **Column 3**: [64, 128, 2, 512] – All distinct; no merges.  \n\n### DOWN Move:\n- **Column 0**: [16, 128, 64, 32] – All distinct; no merges.  \n- **Column 1**: [64, 2, 16, 4] – All distinct; no merges.  \n- **Column 2**: [16, 8, 64, 128] – All distinct; no merges.  \n- **Column 3**: [64, 128, 2, 512] – All distinct; no merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions result in no merges, as there are no adjacent equal tiles and no empty spaces to allow shifting. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the strategy of preserving larger tiles (e.g., 512 in the bottom-right corner), DOWN is chosen to avoid disturbing the corner tile. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on valid moves (adjacent same tiles or empty spaces to shift tiles into). The current grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number to merge.\n\n### Grid Analysis:\nThe grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 16|64|16|64  \nRow 1: 128|2|8|128  \nRow 2: 64|16|64|2  \nRow 3: 32|4|128|512  \n```\n\n### Checking Adjacent Tiles:\n- **Horizontal (same row, adjacent columns):** No adjacent tiles in any row are the same (e.g., Row 0: 16 vs 64 vs 16 vs 64; Row 1: 128 vs 2 vs 8 vs 128; etc.).  \n- **Vertical (same column, adjacent rows):** No adjacent tiles in any column are the same (e.g., Column 0: 16 vs 128 vs 64 vs 32; Column 1: 64 vs 2 vs 16 vs 4; etc.).  \n\n### Valid Moves:\nSince the grid is full (no empty spaces) and no adjacent tiles are the same, **no valid moves exist** (a valid move requires either adjacent same tiles to merge or empty spaces to shift tiles into). However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the absence of valid moves, the game would end, but the question expects a direction. Based on strategic considerations (e.g., larger tiles like 512 in the bottom-right corner), no direction offers a clear advantage, but the problem may assume a default.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic tile placement. The goal is to maximize score through merges while keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 16 | 64 | 16 | 64  \nRow 1: 128 | 2 | 8 | 128  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 64 | 2  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 128 | 512  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \nWhen swiping left, each row is processed leftward, shifting tiles and merging adjacent equal values.  \n\n- **Row 0**: [16, 64, 16, 64]. No merges (16s and 64s are not adjacent after shifting).  \n- **Row 1**: [128, 2, 8, 128]. The 128s at positions 0 and 3 shift left, becoming adjacent. They merge into 256, adding 256 to the score. The row becomes [256, 2, 8, 0].  \n- **Row 2**: [64, 16, 64, 2]. The 64s at positions 0 and 2 shift left, becoming adjacent. They merge into 128, adding 128 to the score. The row becomes [128, 16, 2, 0].  \n- **Row 3**: [32, 4, 128, 512]. No merges (all tiles are distinct and already left-aligned).  \n\n**Total Score Gain**: 256 (from merging 128s) + 128 (from merging 64s) = 384. Larger tiles (512, 256, 128) remain in corners or edges, which is strategically favorable.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \nWhen swiping right, each row is processed rightward.  \n\n- **Row 0**: [16, 64, 16, 64]. No merges (16s and 64s are not adjacent after shifting).  \n- **Row 1**: [128, 2, 8, 128]. No merges (128s are not adjacent after shifting).  \n- **Row 2**: [64, 16, 64, 2]. No merges (64s are not adjacent after shifting).  \n- **Row 3**: [32, 4, 128, 512]. No merges (all tiles are distinct and already right-aligned).  \n\n**Total Score Gain**: 0. No merges occur.  \n\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \nWhen swiping up, each column is processed upward.  \n\n- **Column 0**: [16, 128, 64, 32]. No merges (all values are distinct).  \n- **Column 1**: [64, 2, 16, 4]. No merges (all values are distinct).  \n- **Column 2**: [16, 8, 64, 128]. No merges (all values are distinct).  \n- **Column 3**: [64, 128, 2, 512]. No merges (all values are distinct).  \n\n**Total Score Gain**: 0. No merges occur.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \nWhen swiping down, each column is processed downward.  \n\n- **Column 0**: [16, 128, 64, 32]. No merges (all values are distinct).  \n- **Column 1**: [64, 2, 16, 4]. No merges (all values are distinct).  \n- **Column 2**: [16, 8, 64, 128]. No merges (all values are distinct).  \n- **Column 3**: [64, 128, 2, 512]. No merges (all values are distinct).  \n\n**Total Score Gain**: 0. No merges occur.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe LEFT swipe results in the highest score gain (384) through merging 128s and 64s, while maintaining larger tiles (512, 256, 128) in favorable positions. Other directions yield no merges.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules of merging tiles and shifting. The current board is:\n\n```\n16|64|16|64\n128|2|8|128\n64|16|64|2\n32|4|128|512\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **No Empty Tiles**: All tiles are occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same number.\n2. **No Adjacent Merges**: Checking all rows and columns, there are no adjacent tiles with the same number. For example:\n   - Rows: 16, 64, 16, 64 (no adjacent duplicates); 128, 2, 8, 128 (no adjacent duplicates); 64, 16, 64, 2 (no adjacent duplicates); 32, 4, 128, 512 (no adjacent duplicates).\n   - Columns: 16, 128, 64, 32 (no adjacent duplicates); 64, 2, 16, 4 (no adjacent duplicates); 16, 8, 64, 128 (no adjacent duplicates); 64, 128, 2, 512 (no adjacent duplicates).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Since all tiles are occupied and no adjacent duplicates exist, shifting left or right will not merge any tiles or shift positions (no empty spaces to fill).\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Similarly, vertical shifts (up\/down) will not merge tiles or shift positions, as there are no adjacent duplicates in columns.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are invalid because there are no adjacent tiles to merge and no empty spaces to shift into. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and strategic advice suggests keeping large tiles in corners (the largest tile, 512, is already in the southeast corner), the least disruptive move (maintaining the corner position) is chosen.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and valid moves.

Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16|64|16|64  \nRow 1: 128|2|8|128  \nRow 2: 64|16|64|2  \nRow 3: 32|4|128|512  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \nFor each row, check if adjacent tiles can merge when shifted left:  \n- Row 0: 16, 64, 16, 64 (no adjacent equals).  \n- Row 1: 128, 2, 8, 128 (no adjacent equals).  \n- Row 2: 64, 16, 64, 2 (no adjacent equals).  \n- Row 3: 32, 4, 128, 512 (no adjacent equals).  \nNo merges or shifts possible. **Invalid**.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \nFor each row, check if adjacent tiles can merge when shifted right:  \n- Row 0: 16, 64, 16, 64 (no adjacent equals).  \n- Row 1: 128, 2, 8, 128 (no adjacent equals).  \n- Row 2: 64, 16, 64, 2 (no adjacent equals).  \n- Row 3: 32, 4, 128, 512 (no adjacent equals).  \nNo merges or shifts possible. **Invalid**.\n\n#### **UP**  \nFor each column, check if adjacent tiles can merge when shifted up:  \n- Column 0: 16, 128, 64, 32 (no adjacent equals).  \n- Column 1: 64, 2, 16, 4 (no adjacent equals).  \n- Column 2: 16, 8, 64, 128 (no adjacent equals).  \n- Column 3: 64, 128, 2, 512 (no adjacent equals).  \nNo merges or shifts possible. **Invalid**.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \nFor each column, check if adjacent tiles can merge when shifted down:  \n- Column 0: 16, 128, 64, 32 (no adjacent equals).  \n- Column 1: 64, 2, 16, 4 (no adjacent equals).  \n- Column 2: 16, 8, 64, 128 (no adjacent equals).  \n- Column 3: 64, 128, 2, 512 (no adjacent equals).  \nNo merges or shifts possible. **Invalid**.\n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe grid is full with no adjacent equal tiles in any direction, meaning no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the answer defaults to **DOWN** (arbitrary choice as all moves are invalid).  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on whether tiles can merge or shift into empty spaces. The current board has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves depend on adjacent tiles of the same value merging.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 16 | 64 | 16 | 64  \nRow 1: 128 | 2 | 8 | 128  \nRow 2: 64 | 16 | 64 | 2  \nRow 3: 32 | 4 | 128 | 512  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows are already left-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. No tiles shift or merge.  \n   - Example: Row 0 (16, 64, 16, 64) has no adjacent equal values; tiles remain in place.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - All rows are already right-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. No tiles shift or merge.  \n   - Example: Row 1 (128, 2, 8, 128) has 128s separated by 2 and 8; no merging occurs.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - All columns are already top-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. No tiles shift or merge.  \n   - Example: Column 0 (16, 128, 64, 32) has no adjacent equal values; tiles remain in place.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - All columns are already bottom-aligned with no adjacent equal tiles. No tiles shift or merge.  \n   - Example: Column 3 (64, 128, 2, 512) has no adjacent equal values; tiles remain in place.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same value in any direction. Thus, **no valid moves** exist. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and since all directions are invalid, the answer defaults to any direction (though no move is valid).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The board is:\n\n```\n16|64|16|64\n128|2|8|128\n64|16|64|2\n32|4|128|512\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No Empty Tiles**: All tiles are occupied (no zeros), so movement requires merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **Adjacent Tiles**: No two adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. For example:\n  - Row 0: 16, 64, 16, 64 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 1: 128, 2, 8, 128 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 2: 64, 16, 64, 2 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Row 3: 32, 4, 128, 512 (no adjacent duplicates).\n  - Columns: All columns also have no adjacent duplicates.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: Since there are no empty tiles and no adjacent duplicates, swiping in any direction will not cause tiles to merge or shift. The board remains unchanged in all cases.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWith no valid merges and no empty spaces, all moves result in the same board. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the largest tile (512) is in the bottom-right corner, preserving this corner (e.g., swiping down) aligns with strategic advice to keep large tiles in corners.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile movement.

Invalid move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions are invalid because there are no adjacent equal tiles to merge and no empty spaces to shift tiles into. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the answer defaults to the first option (LEFT) as a placeholder.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules.

Rows 2 and 3 similarly have no merges.  \n   - **Result**: No merges, invalid move (grid is full, no empty spaces to shift into).\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - For each row, tiles shift right. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any row to merge.  \n   - Example: Row 1: `128, 2, 8, 128` (128s are separated by 2 and 8, no adjacency after shifting).

When shifted right, the left 128 moves past 2 and 8 to merge with the right 128, forming 256. Score +256.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles are 64, 16, 64, 2. The two 64s are separated by 16. When shifted right, the left 64 moves past 16 to merge with the right 64, forming 128. Score +128.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles are 32, 4, 128, 512. No adjacent equal tiles. No merges.  \n- **Valid**: Merges occur in Rows 1 and 2, with total score gain of 256 + 128 = 384.\n\n#### **UP**:\n- Columns are processed top-to-bottom. All columns have distinct tiles with no adjacent equals. No merges or shifts occur.  \n- **Invalid**: No valid moves.\n\n#### **DOWN**:\n- Columns are processed bottom-to-top. All columns have distinct tiles with no adjacent equals. No merges or shifts occur.  \n- **Invalid**: No valid moves.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly **RIGHT** is a valid move, as it triggers merges in Rows 1 and 2, increasing the score and maintaining strategic potential with 256 and 128 tiles.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and check for valid moves in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). A valid move requires either adjacent tiles with the same number (which can merge) or empty spaces (0s) to shift tiles into. \n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16|64|16|64  \nRow 1: 128|2|8|128  \nRow 2: 64|16|64|2  \nRow 3: 32|4|128|512  \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **No Empty Tiles**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no 0s).  \n2. **No Adjacent Merges**: Checking all rows and columns, there are no adjacent tiles with the same number. For example:  \n   - Rows: All horizontally adjacent tiles (e.g., 16 & 64 in Row 0, 128 & 2 in Row 1) are distinct.  \n   - Columns: All vertically adjacent tiles (e.g., 16 & 128 in Column 0, 64 & 2 in Column 3) are distinct.  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT\/UP\/DOWN**: Since there are no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles to merge, all directions are invalid. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four options.  \n\nGiven the constraints, even though all moves are invalid, the answer must be one of the four directions.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the game board and check for valid moves (left, right, up, down) based on tile merges or shifts into empty spaces. The current board is:\n\n```\n16|64|16|64\n128|2|8|128\n64|16|64|2\n32|4|128|512\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: All rows have no adjacent equal tiles, and no empty spaces to shift into. Tiles remain unchanged. Not a valid move.  \n- **UP**: All columns have no adjacent equal tiles, and no empty spaces to shift into. Tiles remain unchanged. Not a valid move.  \n- **DOWN**: All columns have no adjacent equal tiles, and no empty spaces to shift into. Tiles remain unchanged. Not a valid move.  \n- **RIGHT**:  \n  - **Row 1**: Original tiles: `128|2|8|128`. When moving right, tiles shift to the rightmost positions. The two `128`s (originally at positions 0 and 3) become adjacent after shifting: `2|8|128|128`. These merge into `256`, resulting in `2|8|256|0`. This is a valid move due to the merge.  \n\nOnly **RIGHT** is a valid move, as it triggers a merge in Row 1.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the valid move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for possible merges or tile movements in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid is fully occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require adjacent tiles of the same value that can merge.\n\n### Grid Analysis:\nThe current grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 16|64|16|64\nRow 1: 128|2|8|128\nRow 2: 64|16|64|2\nRow 3: 32|4|128|512\n```\n\n### Checking Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: All rows have no adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 0: [16,64,16,64] has alternating values, so no merges. Similarly, Rows 1-3 have no adjacent duplicates. No movement or merges possible.  \n2. **RIGHT**: All rows also lack adjacent equal tiles. For example, Row 1: [128,2,8,128] has 128s separated by 2 and 8, so no merges. Rows 0-3 have no valid merges.  \n3. **UP**: Columns are checked for vertical adjacency. Column 0: [16,128,64,32] (all distinct), Column 1: [64,2,16,4] (all distinct), Column 2: [16,8,64,128] (all distinct), Column 3: [64,128,2,512] (all distinct). No vertical merges possible.  \n4. **DOWN**: Columns are checked for vertical adjacency. All columns (0-3) have distinct values, so no vertical merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value. Thus, no valid moves exist. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, any direction is acceptable. \n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n16|64|16|64\n128|2|8|128\n64|16|64|2\n32|4|128|512\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The goal is to position tiles to facilitate future merges and follow the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|2|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|0\nRow 3: 2|0|0|0\n```\nThe tiles are at positions (0,1) and (3,0). No immediate merges are possible, as the tiles are not adjacent. The next step is to shift tiles to create opportunities for future merges.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,2,0,0] → shifts to [2,0,0,0].  \n   - Row 3: [2,0,0,0] → remains [2,0,0,0].  \n   - Result: Tiles at (0,0) and (3,0) (same column, separated by empty rows). A new tile (2\/4) added to an empty cell (e.g., row 1 or 2, column 0) could stack vertically, but merging would require a subsequent UP move.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: [0,2,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,2].  \n   - Row 3: [2,0,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,2].  \n   - Result: Tiles at (0,3) and (3,3) (same column, separated by empty rows). Similar to LEFT but in the rightmost column, with merging requiring a subsequent UP\/DOWN move.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,0,0,2] → shifts to [2,0,0,0] (tile from row 3 moves to row 0).  \n   - Column 1: [2,0,0,0] → remains [2,0,0,0] (tile from row 0 stays).  \n   - Result: Tiles at (0,0) and (0,1) (same row, adjacent). A new tile (2\/4) added to row 0 (e.g., column 2) would create three 2s in a row, allowing a LEFT move to merge two 2s into a 4 (score +4) in the next step.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 0: [0,0,0,2] → remains [0,0,0,2].  \n   - Column 1: [2,0,0,0] → shifts to [0,0,0,2] (tile from row 0 moves to row 3).  \n   - Result: Tiles at (3,0) and (3,1) (same row, adjacent). A new tile added to row 3 (e.g., column 2) would create three 2s in a row, but merging would require a subsequent LEFT move, similar to UP but in the bottom row.  \n\n\n### Optimal Move:\nMoving **UP** positions the two 2s in the top row (row 0), adjacent to each other. This aligns with the strategy of keeping tiles in a corner (top-left) and creates immediate opportunities for horizontal merging (e.g., with a new tile added to row 0, column 2). A subsequent LEFT move can then merge the 2s into a 4, increasing the score and building larger tiles in the corner.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 2|2|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|2|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: [2, 2, 0, 0] → Tiles shift left, merging the two 2s into a 4.

The 2s in Column 0 (Rows 2 and 3) are aligned vertically, setting up for a potential future merge if swiped up.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [4,0,0,0] → shifts right to [0,0,0,4].  \n- **Row 1**: [0,0,0,0] → remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- **Row 2**: [2,0,0,0] → shifts right to [0,0,0,2].  \n- **Row 3**: [0,0,0,2] → shifts right to [0,0,0,2].  \n\nResulting board after shifting right:  \n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|2  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|2  \n```  \nNo immediate merges. The 4 moves to the top-right corner, and the 2s in Column 3 (Rows 2 and 3) are aligned vertically. However, the top-right corner is less commonly prioritized for early strategy compared to the top-left.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [4,0,2,0] → shifts up to [4,2,0,0].  \n- **Column 1**: All zeros → remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 2**: All zeros → remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,2] → shifts up to [2,0,0,0].  \n\nResulting board after shifting up:  \n```\nRow 0: 4|0|0|2  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n```  \nNo immediate merges. The 4 stays in the top-left, but the 2 in Row 0, Column 3 disrupts the corner focus, making future merges less predictable.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [4,0,2,0] → shifts down to [0,0,4,2].  \n- **Column 1**: All zeros → remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 2**: All zeros → remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- **Column 3**: [0,0,0,2] → shifts down to [0,0,0,2].  \n\nResulting board after shifting down:  \n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 2|0|0|2  \n```  \nNo immediate merges. The 4 moves to Row 2, Column 0, losing the corner advantage and reducing strategic positioning for future moves.\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe LEFT move keeps the largest tile (4) in the top-left corner (a strategic corner) and aligns the 2s vertically in Column 0, setting up for potential future merges (e.g., swiping up to merge the 2s). This direction best supports long-term strategy.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4 | 2 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles in each row shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles in each row shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Columns are processed from top to bottom. For column 0 (values: 4, 0, 2, 2):  \n   - The 2s in rows 2 and 3 move up, becoming adjacent. They merge into a 4 (score +4).  \n   - The 4 in row 0 remains in row 0, and the merged 4 moves to row 1.  \n   Other columns (1, 2, 3) have no merges, as they contain only a 2 in row 0, column 1 (which shifts up to row 0, column 1) and zeros elsewhere.  \n   After merging, the board becomes:  \n   Row 0: 4 | 2 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 1: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 2: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   A new tile (2 or 4) will spawn in an empty spot. This move strategically consolidates 4s in the top-left corner, aligning with the goal of keeping large tiles in a corner.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Columns are processed from bottom to top. For column 0 (values: 4, 0, 2, 2):  \n   - The 2s in rows 2 and 3 merge into a 4 (score +4) and shift to row 3.  \n   - The 4 in row 0 shifts down to row 2.  \n   Other columns (1, 2, 3) have no merges, as the 2 in row 0, column 1 shifts down to row 3, column 1.  \n   After merging, the board becomes:  \n   Row 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 1: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 2: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 3: 4 | 2 | 0 | 0  \n   A new tile (2 or 4) will spawn in an empty spot. While this also merges 2s, the 4s are placed in the bottom-left corner, which is less optimal for future merges compared to the top-left corner.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP move merges two 2s into a 4 (score +4), consolidates 4s in the top-left corner (a strategic corner), and sets up future opportunities to merge the 4s in column 0. This aligns with the goal of building larger tiles in a corner.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential, score gain, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `4|2|0|2` shift left to `4|2|2|0`, then merge the two `2`s into `4`, resulting in `4|4|0|0`. Score gain: 4.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `4|0|0|0` shift left to `4|0|0|0` (no merge).\n- **Rows 2-3**: Remain empty.  \n*Result*: Limited merging (only 4 points) and larger tiles (4s) not optimally positioned.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles `4|2|0|2` shift right to `0|4|2|2`, then merge the two `2`s into `4`, resulting in `0|4|4|0`. Score gain: 4.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles `4|0|0|0` shift right to `0|0|0|4` (no merge).\n- **Rows 2-3**: Remain empty.  \n*Result*: Similar to LEFT, with only 4 points gained and larger tiles (4s) in the middle of the row.\n\n### UP Move:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles `4` (row 0) and `4` (row 1) merge into `8` (topmost position), resulting in `8|0|0|0` for the column. Score gain: 8.\n- **Column 1**: Tile `2` (row 0) shifts up to `2|0|0|0` (no merge).\n- **Column 3**: Tile `2` (row 0) shifts up to `2|0|0|0` (no merge).\n- **Columns 2**: Remain empty.  \n*Result*: Merges two `4`s into an `8` (8 points) and positions the `8` in the top-left corner (a strategic corner for larger tiles).\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- **Column 0**: Tiles `4` (row 0) and `4` (row 1) shift down and merge into `8` (bottommost position), resulting in `0|0|0|8` for the column. Score gain: 8.\n- **Column 1**: Tile `2` (row 0) shifts down to `0|0|0|2` (no merge).\n- **Column 3**: Tile `2` (row 0) shifts down to `0|0|0|2` (no merge).\n- **Columns 2**: Remain empty.  \n*Result*: Merges two `4`s into an `8` (8 points) but positions the `8` in the bottom-left corner.\n\n### Strategic Comparison:\nBoth UP and DOWN yield 8 points, but UP positions the `8` in the top-left corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners and allowing smaller tiles (e.g., `2`s in row 0) to be merged toward the corner in subsequent moves. This enhances future merging potential.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and merging rules.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|2|0|2\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|0|4\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \nTiles in each row shift left, merging adjacent equal tiles:  \n- **Row 0**: `8|2|0|2` → Shift left → `8|2|2|0` (empty spaces filled by moving tiles). The two `2`s merge into `4`, resulting in `8|4|0|0` (score +4).  \n- **Row 1**: All zeros, remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n- **Row 2**: `0|0|0|4` → Shift left → `4|0|0|0`.  \n- **Row 3**: All zeros, remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n\nAfter LEFT, the board becomes:  \n```\n8|4|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n4|0|0|0  \n0|0|0|0  \n```  \nThis move merges two `2`s into a `4`, generating score and consolidating tiles on the left.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \nTiles in each row shift right, merging adjacent equal tiles:  \n- **Row 0**: `8|2|0|2` → Shift right → `0|8|2|2` (empty spaces filled by moving tiles).

It merges two `2`s into a `4` (scoring 4), consolidates tiles on the left (strategic for cornering larger tiles), and creates a more organized board for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game board and merging potential:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 8|4|4|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift left. The two adjacent 4s merge into 8 (score +8). Result: 8|8|0|0.  \n- **Row 1**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 2**: The 4 shifts left to the first position. Result: 4|0|0|0.  \n- **Row 3**: All zeros, no change.  \nAfter merging, the board becomes:  \nRow 0: 8|8|0|0  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \nThis move merges 4s into 8, gains 8 points, and keeps larger tiles (8s) on the left, aligning with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in a corner.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: Tiles shift right. The two 4s merge into 8 (score +8). Result: 0|0|8|8.  \n- **Row 1**: All zeros, no change.  \n- **Row 2**: The 4 shifts right to the last position. Result: 0|0|0|4.  \n- **Row 3**: All zeros, no change.  \nAfter merging, the board becomes:  \nRow 0: 0|0|8|8  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|4  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \nThis also merges 4s into 8 and gains 8 points, but the 8s are shifted to the right, which may complicate future consolidation.\n\n\n#### **UP Move**:\n- Columns are processed upward. No adjacent equal tiles merge (e.g., 8 and 4 in Column 0 are distinct). No score is gained. The board remains mostly unchanged, with minimal tile movement. This is suboptimal for scoring.\n\n\n#### **DOWN Move**:\n- Columns are processed downward. No adjacent equal tiles merge (e.g., 8 and 4 in Column 0 are distinct). No score is gained. The board remains mostly unchanged, with minimal tile movement. This is also suboptimal for scoring.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge 4s into 8 (gaining 8 points), but LEFT keeps larger tiles (8s) on the left, aligning with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in a corner for future merges. Thus, LEFT is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, grouping large tiles in corners, and setting up future merges).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 1: 8|8|0|0  \nRow 2: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 4: 0|2|0|0  \n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 1: The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in `16|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 2: Remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 3: The 4 shifts left to `4|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 4: The 2 shifts left to `2|0|0|0`.  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     16|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     4|0|0|0  \n     2|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - This groups the 16 (largest tile) in the top-left corner, with smaller tiles (4, 2) aligned vertically in the left column, setting up potential future vertical merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 1: The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16), resulting in `0|0|0|16`.  \n   - Row 2: Remains `0|0|0|0`.  \n   - Row 3: The 4 shifts right to `0|0|0|4`.  \n   - Row 4: The 2 shifts right to `0|0|0|2`.  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     ```\n     0|0|0|16  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|4  \n     0|0|0|2  \n     ```  \n   - This groups the 16 in the top-right corner, with smaller tiles (4, 2) aligned vertically in the right column. While valid, the 4 and 2 are initially in the left\/middle columns, making this direction less natural for alignment.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed vertically, but no merges occur (tiles are not adjacent or equal). The board becomes:  \n     ```\n     8|8|0|0  \n     4|2|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - No score gain, and tiles are scattered, offering no strategic advantage.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed vertically, but no merges occur. The board becomes:  \n     ```\n     0|0|0|0  \n     0|0|0|0  \n     8|8|0|0  \n     4|2|0|0  \n     ```  \n   - No score gain, and tiles are clustered in the bottom rows without clear alignment for future merges.\n\n### Strategic Decision:\nLEFT is preferred because it merges the 8s into a 16 (top-left corner) and aligns smaller tiles (4, 2) in the left column, creating opportunities for vertical merges in subsequent moves. This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner and grouping smaller tiles for future combinations.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of each possible swipe (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to position tiles for future merges and maximize scoring opportunities.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 16|0|0|4  \nRow 1: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 2|0|0|0  \n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Tiles in each row shift left.  \n   - Row 0: [16, 0, 0, 4] → [16, 4, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Rows 1-3: No changes (all zeros or single non-zero tiles).  \n   - Result: No merges. No immediate score gain.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Tiles in each row shift right.  \n   - Row 0: [16, 0, 0, 4] → [0, 0, 16, 4] (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: [2, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merge).  \n   - Result: The 4 in Row 0, Column 3 and the 4 in Row 2, Column 3 align vertically in Column 3. This positions them for a potential merge with a subsequent UP move.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Tiles in each column shift up.  \n   - Column 0: [16, 0, 4, 2] → [16, 4, 2, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [4, 0, 0, 0] (no merge).  \n   - Result: No merges. Tiles are spread out with no clear path for future merges.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Tiles in each column shift down.  \n   - Column 0: [16, 0, 4, 2] → [0, 16, 4, 2] (no merge).  \n   - Column 3: [4, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 0, 4] (no merge).  \n   - Result: No merges. Tiles are spread out with no strategic positioning.\n\n### Key Insight:\nMoving RIGHT aligns the two 4s in Column 3 (Row 0 and Row 2). This sets up a future UP move where these 4s can merge into an 8, generating score. This strategic positioning is critical for maximizing long-term scoring potential.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN, focusing on merging opportunities and positioning of larger tiles to maximize future merges.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|16|4\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|4|4\nRow 3: 0|0|0|2\n```\nKey tiles: 16 (row 0, column 2), 4 (row 0, column 3), two 4s (row 2, columns 2-3), and 2 (row 3, column 3).\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### 1. LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,16,4] → shifts left to [16,4,0,0] (no merge).\n- **Row 2**: [0,0,4,4] → shifts left, merging 4s into 8 → [8,0,0,0] (score +8).\n- **Row 3**: [0,0,0,2] → shifts left to [2,0,0,0].\n- Result: Larger tiles (16, 8, 4, 2) cluster on the left edge. However, 16 and 4 in row 0 are not adjacent for future merges.\n\n#### 2. RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: [0,0,16,4] → shifts right (no change, already right-aligned).\n- **Row 2**: [0,0,4,4] → shifts right, merging 4s into 8 → [0,0,0,8] (score +8).\n- **Row 3**: [0,0,0,2] → shifts right (no change, already right-aligned).\n- Result: Larger tiles (16, 8, 4, 2) cluster on the right edge. 16 and 4 in row 0 are not adjacent for future merges.\n\n#### 3. UP:\n- **Column 2**: [16,0,4,0] → shifts up to [16,4,0,0] (no merge).\n- **Column 3**: [4,0,4,2] → shifts up, merging 4s into 8 → [8,2,0,0] (score +8).\n- Result: Larger tiles (16, 8, 4, 2) cluster in the top-right corner (row 0, columns 2-3; row 1, columns 2-3). The 16 and 8 are in the top row, which may be vulnerable to new tiles blocking future moves.\n\n#### 4. DOWN:\n- **Column 2**: [16,0,4,0] → shifts down to [0,0,16,4] (no merge).\n- **Column 3**: [4,0,4,2] → shifts down, merging 4s into 8 → [0,0,8,2] (score +8).\n- Result: Larger tiles (16, 8, 4, 2) cluster in the bottom-right corner (row 2, columns 2-3; row 3, columns 2-3). The 16 (row 2, column 2) and 8 (row 2, column 3) are adjacent in the same row, and 4 (row 3, column 2) and 2 (row 3, column 3) are below them. This consolidates larger tiles in a corner, ideal for future merges (e.g., 16 with another 16, 8 with another 8).\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping DOWN positions the largest tiles (16, 8, 4, 2) in the bottom-right corner, a strategic position for building higher merges. This aligns with the goal of keeping larger tiles in a corner and maximizing future opportunities.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|2\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 0|0|16|8\nRow 3: 0|0|4|2\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles in each row shift right. All rows already have tiles as far right as possible (e.g., row 0 has `2` in column 3, row 2 has `16` and `8` in columns 2 and 3, etc.). No merging occurs, and the board remains unchanged. This is not useful.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Tiles in each column shift up. Column 0 and 1 are empty, so no change. Column 2 has `16` (row 2) and `4` (row 3), which shift to rows 0 and 1. Column 3 has `2` (row 0), `8` (row 2), and `2` (row 3), which shift to rows 0, 1, and 2. No merging occurs, and larger tiles (e.g., `16`) are scattered, making future merges harder.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles in each column shift down. Columns 0 and 1 are empty, so no change. Column 2 has `16` (row 2) and `4` (row 3), which stay in place. Column 3 has `2` (row 0) shifting to row 1, `8` (row 2) staying, and `2` (row 3) staying. No merging occurs, and the board remains largely unchanged.\n\n4. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles in each row shift left.  \n   - Row 0: `0|0|0|2` → `2|0|0|0` (no merge).  \n   - Row 1: `0|0|0|0` → `0|0|0|0` (no change).  \n   - Row 2: `0|0|16|8` → `16|8|0|0` (no merge).  \n   - Row 3: `0|0|4|2` → `4|2|0|0` (no merge).  \n\n   After moving left, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 2|0|0|0  \n   Row 1: 0|0|0|0  \n   Row 2: 16|8|0|0  \n   Row 3: 4|2|0|0  \n   ```  \n\n   This consolidates all non-zero tiles to the left edge, with larger tiles (`16`, `8`, `4`, `2`) aligned in adjacent rows and columns. This positioning facilitates future merges (e.g., if a new `2` appears in row 0, column 1, moving left would merge it with the existing `2` in row 0, column 0). Keeping larger tiles in a corner (here, the left edge) aligns with the strategic goal of maximizing future merging potential.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT consolidates tiles to the left edge, positions larger tiles advantageously, and sets up better opportunities for future merges.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to merge tiles strategically, keep larger tiles in a corner, and set up for future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2|0|8|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|8|0|0\nRow 3: 4|2|0|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [2, 0, 8, 0] → Tiles shift left to [2, 8, 0, 0] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: All zeros (no change).\n- **Row 2**: [16, 8, 0, 0] → Tiles shift left to [16, 8, 0, 0] (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: [4, 2, 0, 0] → Tiles shift left to [4, 2, 0, 0] (no merges).\n\nAfter a left swipe, the board becomes:\n```\nRow 0: 2|8|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|8|0|0\nRow 3: 4|2|0|0\n```\nNo merges occur, but larger tiles (16, 8, 4, 2) remain aligned on the left side, a corner, which is strategic for future merges.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [2, 0, 8, 0] → Tiles shift right to [0, 0, 2, 8] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: All zeros (no change).\n- **Row 2**: [16, 8, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right to [0, 0, 16, 8] (no merges).\n- **Row 3**: [4, 2, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right to [0, 0, 4, 2] (no merges).\n\nAfter a right swipe, larger tiles are spread to the right, which is less optimal for corner concentration.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [2, 0, 16, 4] → Tiles shift up to [2, 16, 4, 0] (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [0, 0, 8, 2] → Tiles shift up to [8, 2, 0, 0] (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: [8, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift up to [8, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).\n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 0, 2] → Tiles shift up to [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).\n\nAfter an up swipe, tiles are spread vertically, reducing corner concentration.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [2, 0, 16, 4] → Tiles shift down to [0, 2, 16, 4] (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [0, 0, 8, 2] → Tiles shift down to [0, 0, 8, 2] (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: [8, 0, 0, 0] → Tiles shift down to [0, 0, 0, 8] (no merges).\n- **Column 3**: [0, 0, 0, 2] → Tiles shift down to [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merges).\n\nAfter a down swipe, tiles are spread downward, which is less optimal for corner alignment.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe left swipe keeps larger tiles (16, 8, 4, 2) aligned on the left side (a corner), which is strategic for future merges. Other directions spread tiles less effectively. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the resulting board state, potential merges, and strategic positioning of tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2|8|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|0\nRow 2: 16|8|0|0\nRow 3: 4|2|0|4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n  Result: No merges, poor strategic value.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Tiles shift right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles in any row). The board remains mostly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n  Result: No merges, poor strategic value.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed. In Column 1 (values: [8, 0, 8, 2]), the two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). Other columns have no merges.  \n  Resulting Board:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 2|16|0|4  \n  Row 1:16|2|0|0  \n  Row 2:4|0|0|0  \n  Row 3:0|0|0|0  \n  ```  \n  Strategic Note: Merged 16 is isolated; no clear path for future large merges.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed. In Column 1 (values: [8, 0, 8, 2]), the two 8s merge into 16 (score +16). Additionally, Row 2 after the swipe becomes `16|16|0|0` (two adjacent 16s).  \n  Resulting Board:  \n  ```\n  Row 0:0|0|0|0  \n  Row 1:2|0|0|0  \n  Row 2:16|16|0|0  \n  Row 3:4|2|0|4  \n  ```  \n  Strategic Note: The adjacent 16s in Row 2 can be merged into 32 with a subsequent LEFT swipe, setting up for higher scores. This aligns with the strategy of keeping larger tiles grouped for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DOWN swipe merges two 8s (gaining 16 points) and positions two 16s adjacently, creating a strong opportunity for a future 32 merge. This makes DOWN the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN on the given game board. The goal is to maximize score through tile merges and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 0|0|4|0  \nRow 1: 2|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 16|16|0|0  \nRow 3: 4|2|0|4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,4,0] → [4,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [2,0,0,0] → [2,0,0,0] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [16,16,0,0] → [32,0,0,0] (merge 16+16=32, score +32).  \n- **Row 3**: [4,2,0,4] → [4,2,4,0] (no merge).  \n**Total Score from LEFT**: 32.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [0,0,4,0] → [0,0,0,4] (no merge).  \n- **Row 1**: [2,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,2] (no merge).  \n- **Row 2**: [16,16,0,0] → [0,0,0,32] (merge 16+16=32, score +32).  \n- **Row 3**: [4,2,0,4] → [0,2,4,4] → [0,2,0,8] (merge 4+4=8, score +8).  \n**Total Score from RIGHT**: 32 + 8 = 40.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed top to bottom. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges.  \n**Total Score from UP**: 0.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed bottom to top. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges.  \n**Total Score from DOWN**: 0.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nRIGHT yields the highest score (40) due to two merges (16+16=32 and 4+4=8). It also consolidates larger tiles (32 and 8) toward the right edge, which is strategically favorable.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down.

Columns are processed vertically.  \n   - Column 1: [0,0,2,4] → [2,4,0,0] (2 moves to row 0, 4 to row 1).  \n   - Column 2: [0,0,0,2] → [2,0,0,0] (2 moves to row 0).  \n   - Columns 0 and 3: No merges or movement.  \n   - Resulting board:  \n     Row 0: 0|2|2|4  \n     Row 1: 0|4|0|2  \n     Row 2: 0|0|0|32  \n     Row 3: 0|0|0|4  \n   - No score gained, but row 0 now has adjacent 2s (columns 1 and 2). This sets up a future merge opportunity (swiping left next turn would merge these 2s into a 4, scoring 4). The largest tile (32) remains in column 3 (corner).\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift down. No merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles).  \n   - Resulting board: No meaningful movement or strategic setup. Larger tile (32) remains in column 3, but no progress toward future merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe positions two 2s adjacently in row 0, creating a future merge opportunity. It also keeps the largest tile (32) in the corner (row 2, column 3), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners. This makes UP the best move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|2|2|4\nRow 1: 0|4|4|2\nRow 2: 0|0|0|32\nRow 3: 0|0|0|4\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed upward. All columns either have no non-zero tiles (Column 0) or non-zero tiles that cannot merge (Columns 1-3, as no adjacent tiles are equal). No tiles shift or merge.  \n- **Result**: No valid move (no tiles move or merge).  \n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- Columns are processed downward. Columns 1 and 2 (originally `[2,4,0,0]` and `[2,4,0,0]`) shift tiles to the bottom but do not merge (2 and 4 are distinct). Column 3 (`[4,2,32,4]`) has no zeros to shift into, so tiles remain in place.  \n- **Result**: No merges occur, score = 0.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- Rows are processed rightward:  \n  - Row 0: `[0,2,2,4]` → shift right, merge 2+2=4 → `[0,0,4,4]` (score +4).  \n  - Row 1: `[0,4,4,2]` → shift right, merge 4+4=8 → `[0,0,8,2]` (score +8).  \n  - Rows 2-3: No merges (32 and 4 stay right-aligned).  \n- **Total Score**: 12.  \n- **Resulting Board**: Larger tiles (32, 8, 4) are right-aligned but not tightly grouped in a corner.  \n\n#### **LEFT Swipe**:\n- Rows are processed leftward:  \n  - Row 0: `[0,2,2,4]` → shift left, merge 2+2=4 → `[4,4,0,0]` (score +4).  \n  - Row 1: `[0,4,4,2]` → shift left, merge 4+4=8 → `[8,2,0,0]` (score +8).  \n  - Row 2: `[0,0,0,32]` → shift left → `[32,0,0,0]`.  \n  - Row 3: `[0,0,0,4]` → shift left → `[4,0,0,0]`.  \n- **Total Score**: 12.  \n- **Resulting Board**: Larger tiles (32, 8, 4, 4) are left-aligned, consolidating in the left corner. This grouping is strategic for future merges, as larger tiles are centralized in a corner with empty spaces on the right to spawn new tiles without blocking progress.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT swipe maximizes score (12) and strategically positions larger tiles in the left corner, optimizing future merge potential. RIGHT swipe also scores 12 but leaves larger tiles less consolidated. UP is invalid, and DOWN scores 0.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize score through merging and position larger tiles strategically.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 4|4|0|0\nRow 1: 8|2|0|0\nRow 2:32|8|0|0\nRow 3: 4|0|0|0\n```\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles `4|4|0|0` shift left, merging the two `4`s into `8` (score +8). Result: `8|0|0|0`.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles `8|2|0|0` shift left with no merges. Result: `8|2|0|0`.  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles `32|8|0|0` shift left with no merges. Result: `32|8|0|0`.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles `4|0|0|0` shift left with no merges. Result: `4|0|0|0`.  \n   After LEFT, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   8|0|0|0  \n   8|2|0|0  \n   32|8|0|0  \n   4|0|0|0  \n   ```  \n   This positions two `8`s in Column 0 (Rows 0 and 1), setting up a potential future merge (e.g., swiping UP next could merge these `8`s into `16`).\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - **Row 0**: Tiles `4|4|0|0` shift right, merging the two `4`s into `8` (score +8). Result: `0|0|0|8`.  \n   - **Row 1**: Tiles `8|2|0|0` shift right with no merges. Result: `0|0|8|2`.  \n   - **Row 2**: Tiles `32|8|0|0` shift right with no merges. Result: `0|0|32|8`.  \n   - **Row 3**: Tiles `4|0|0|0` shift right with no merges. Result: `0|0|0|4`.  \n   After RIGHT, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   0|0|0|8  \n   0|0|8|2  \n   0|0|32|8  \n   0|0|0|4  \n   ```  \n   Larger tiles are spread across the right edge, but no immediate future merges are set up.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift upward, but no columns contain adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to trigger merges. The board remains unchanged, with no score gain.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift downward, but no columns contain adjacent equal tiles or empty spaces to trigger merges. The board remains unchanged, with no score gain.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both merge the `4`s in Row 0 for an 8-point gain. However, LEFT positions two `8`s in Column 0, creating a strategic opportunity for future merges (e.g., swiping UP next could merge these `8`s into `16`). This makes LEFT the better choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the potential outcomes of swiping in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score through merging tiles and strategically positioning larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 8|0|0|0\nRow 1: 8|2|0|0\nRow 2: 32|8|0|0\nRow 3: 4|0|16|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \nTiles shift left, but no merges occur in any row (all adjacent tiles are distinct). No score gain. The board remains mostly unchanged, with minimal tile movement. **Score: 0**.\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \nTiles shift right, but no merges occur in any row (adjacent tiles are distinct). No score gain. Tiles move to the rightmost positions but do not merge. **Score: 0**.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \nTiles shift upward, merging where possible. Let’s analyze columns:  \n- **Column 0**: [8 (Row 0), 8 (Row 1), 32 (Row 2), 4 (Row 3)]. The two 8s (Row 0 and Row 1) merge into 16 (score += 16). The remaining tiles (32, 4) shift up: Row 0 = 16, Row 1 = 32, Row 2 = 4, Row 3 = 0.  \n- **Column 1**: [0 (Row 0), 2 (Row 1), 8 (Row 2), 0 (Row 3)]. Tiles 2 and 8 shift up: Row 0 = 2, Row 1 = 8, Rows 2-3 = 0.  \n- **Column 2**: [0 (Row 0), 0 (Row 1), 0 (Row 2), 16 (Row 3)]. The 16 shifts up to Row 0.  \n- **Column 3**: All zeros, no change.  \n\nResulting board after UP swipe:  \n```\nRow 0: 16|2|16|0  \nRow 1: 32|8|0|0  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n```  \n**Score: 16**. Larger tiles (32, 16) are positioned in the top rows, aligning with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in a corner.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \nTiles shift downward, merging where possible. Let’s analyze columns:  \n- **Column 0**: [8 (Row 0), 8 (Row 1), 32 (Row 2), 4 (Row 3)]. The two 8s (Row 0 and Row 1) merge into 16 (score += 16). The remaining tiles (32, 4) shift down: Row 0 = 0, Row 1 = 16, Row 2 = 32, Row 3 = 4.  \n- **Column 1**: [0 (Row 0), 2 (Row 1), 8 (Row 2), 0 (Row 3)]. Tiles 2 and 8 shift down: Row 0 = 0, Row 1 = 0, Row 2 = 2, Row 3 = 8.  \n- **Column 2**: [0 (Row 0), 0 (Row 1), 0 (Row 2), 16 (Row 3)]. No change (16 is already at the bottom).  \n- **Column 3**: All zeros, no change.  \n\nResulting board after DOWN swipe:  \n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0  \nRow 1: 16|0|0|0  \nRow 2: 32|2|0|0  \nRow 3: 4|8|16|0  \n```  \n**Score: 16**. Larger tiles (32, 16) are spread across lower rows, which is less strategic for future merges.\n\n### Conclusion  \nUP and DOWN both yield a score of 16, but UP positions larger tiles (32, 16) in the top rows, aligning with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in a corner for future merges. LEFT and RIGHT provide no score gain and are suboptimal.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, keeping larger tiles in a corner, and creating future merge opportunities).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16|2|16|0  \nRow 1: 32|8|16|0  \nRow 2: 4|0|0|0  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Each row shifts left, but no adjacent tiles are equal. No merges occur. The board remains nearly unchanged, with no score gain.  \n- **Outcome**: No merges, low utility.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Each row shifts right, but no adjacent tiles are equal. No merges occur. Tiles shift to the right edge but do not combine.  \n- **Outcome**: No merges, low utility.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Columns are processed from top to bottom. Key observation:  \n  - **Column 2** (values: 16, 16, 0, 0) shifts up, merging the two 16s into a 32 (score +32).  \n  - Other columns (0, 1, 3) have no merges but shift tiles upward.  \n- **Resulting Board**:  \n  Row 0: 16|2|32|0  \n  Row 1: 32|8|0|0  \n  Row 2: 4|0|0|0  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|0  \n- **Utility**: Merges two 16s into a 32, keeps larger tiles (32, 16) in the upper rows, aligning with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Columns are processed from bottom to top. Key observation:  \n  - **Column 2** (values: 16, 16, 0, 0) shifts down, merging the two 16s into a 32 (score +32).  \n  - Other columns (0, 1, 3) shift tiles downward but have no merges.  \n- **Resulting Board**:  \n  Row 0: 0|0|0|0  \n  Row 1: 16|0|0|0  \n  Row 2: 32|2|0|0  \n  Row 3: 4|8|32|0  \n- **Utility**: Merges two 16s but scatters larger tiles (16, 32) across lower rows, reducing corner concentration.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe UP move merges two 16s into a 32 (score +32) and keeps larger tiles (32, 16) in the upper rows, aligning with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner. This provides better future merge opportunities compared to DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN):\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16 | 2 | 32 | 0  \nRow 1: 32 | 8 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 8 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### **LEFT Swipe**  \nEach row shifts left, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles). The board remains mostly unchanged, with minimal tile movement. No score is gained.  \n\n\n### **RIGHT Swipe**  \nEach row shifts right, but no merges occur (no adjacent equal tiles). Tiles spread to the right, leaving empty spaces on the left. No score is gained.  \n\n\n### **UP Swipe**  \nColumns are processed top-to-bottom. Key observations:  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles [2, 8, 0, 8] shift up to [2, 8, 8, 0]. The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16).  \n- Other columns (0, 2, 3) have no merges.  \n\nResulting board after UP:  \nRow 0: 16 | 2 | 32 | 0  \nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 4 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\nLarger tiles (32, 16, 16) are consolidated in the top rows, leaving empty spaces below for future moves.  \n\n\n### **DOWN Swipe**  \nColumns are processed bottom-to-top. Key observations:  \n- **Column 1**: Tiles [2, 8, 0, 8] shift down to [0, 2, 8, 8]. The two 8s merge into 16 (score +16).  \n- Other columns (0, 2, 3) have no merges.  \n\nResulting board after DOWN:  \nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 16 | 2 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 32 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 4 | 16 | 32 | 0  \n\nLarger tiles (32, 16, 16) are spread across lower rows, with empty spaces above.  \n\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nBoth UP and DOWN yield a merge (8+8=16, score +16). However, UP consolidates larger tiles in the top rows, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner to facilitate future merges. DOWN spreads larger tiles, making it harder to merge them later.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to prioritize moves that align tiles for future merges and keep larger tiles in a corner for strategic advantage.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 16 | 2 | 32 | 0  \nRow 1: 32 | 16 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 4 | 0 | 2 | 0  \nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles in each row shift as far left as possible.  \n   - Row 0: [16, 2, 32, 0] → No merges (all distinct), remains [16, 2, 32, 0].  \n   - Row 1: [32, 16, 0, 0] → No merges, remains [32, 16, 0, 0].  \n   - Row 2: [4, 0, 2, 0] → Tiles shift left to [4, 2, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: All zeros, unchanged.  \n   - **Outcome**: Tiles are aligned left, with no immediate merges, but sets up for future merges (e.g., if a 2 appears in Row 0, Column 3, a subsequent left swipe could merge the 2s in Row 0, Columns 1 and 3).  \n\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles in each row shift as far right as possible.  \n   - Row 0: [16, 2, 32, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 16, 2, 32] (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [32, 16, 0, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 32, 16] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [4, 0, 2, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 4, 2] (no merges).  \n   - Row 3: All zeros, unchanged.  \n   - **Outcome**: Tiles are aligned right, but larger tiles (e.g., 32 in Row 0, Column 3) are spread out, making future merges less likely.  \n\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles in each column shift as far up as possible.  \n   - Column 0: [16, 32, 4, 0] → No merges, remains [16, 32, 4, 0].  \n   - Column 1: [2, 16, 0, 0] → No merges, remains [2, 16, 0, 0].  \n   - Column 2: [32, 0, 2, 0] → No merges, remains [32, 2, 0, 0].  \n   - Column 3: All zeros, unchanged.  \n   - **Outcome**: Tiles are stacked upward, but no meaningful alignment for future merges.  \n\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles in each column shift as far down as possible.  \n   - Column 0: [16, 32, 4, 0] → Shifts down to [0, 16, 32, 4] (no merges).  \n   - Column 1: [2, 16, 0, 0] → Shifts down to [0, 0, 2, 16] (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [32, 0, 2, 0] → Shifts down to [0, 0, 32, 2] (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: All zeros, unchanged.  \n   - **Outcome**: Tiles are spread downward, with larger tiles (e.g., 32 in Column 0, Row 2) misaligned for future merges.  \n\n\n### Strategy and Conclusion:\nThe key strategy in 2048 is to keep larger tiles in a corner and align smaller tiles for future merges. Swiping **LEFT** aligns tiles to the left, consolidating smaller tiles (e.g., 2, 4) in the same row and positioning larger tiles (16, 32) closer to the top-left corner. This setup increases the likelihood of future merges (e.g., if a duplicate tile appears in an empty space, a subsequent left swipe can merge them). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 16|2|32|0\nRow 1: 32|16|0|0\nRow 2: 4|2|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|16|0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Tiles shift left, but no adjacent equal tiles merge (e.g., Row 0: `16|2|32|0` remains; Row 1: `32|16|0|0` remains).  \n- No merges occur, and larger tiles (32, 16) are scattered across the left\/middle columns, lacking a clear corner focus.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Tiles shift right, with no immediate merges, but larger tiles cluster toward the right edge:  \n  - Row 0: `0|16|2|32` (32 in top-right corner).  \n  - Row 1: `0|0|32|16` (32 and 16 in right columns).  \n  - Row 2: `0|0|4|2` (4 and 2 in right columns).  \n  - Row 3: `0|0|0|16` (16 in bottom-right corner).  \n- This positions larger tiles (32, 16) in or near the rightmost column, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners for future merges.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Tiles shift up, but no adjacent equal tiles merge (e.g., Column 0: `16|32|4|0` remains; Column 1: `2|16|2|0` remains).  \n- Larger tiles remain spread across rows, with no clear corner clustering.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles shift down, but no adjacent equal tiles merge (e.g., Column 0: `0|16|32|4`; Column 1: `0|2|16|2`).  \n- Larger tiles (32, 16) are scattered downward, with no focused corner positioning.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhile no immediate merges occur in any direction, **RIGHT** optimally positions larger tiles (32, 16) in or near the rightmost column (top-right and bottom-right corners), which is strategic for future merges and maintaining control over the board.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to identify moves that create opportunities for merging tiles, which increases the score and strategically positions larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 0|16|2|32  \nRow 1: 0|0|32|16  \nRow 2: 0|0|4|2  \nRow 3: 0|4|0|16  \n```\nKey observations:\n- No adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) are the same, so merges are only possible if tiles shift into positions where they align with identical values.\n- Empty spaces (0s) are distributed across the board, allowing tiles to shift in multiple directions.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n#### LEFT Swipe:\n- Each row shifts left, but no merges occur (all tiles in rows are distinct).  \n- Result: Tiles cluster to the left but no new merges are set up.  \n\n#### RIGHT Swipe:\n- Each row shifts right, but no merges occur (tiles remain distinct).  \n- Result: Tiles cluster to the right, but no new merges are set up.  \n\n#### UP Swipe:\n- Columns shift up, but no merges occur (tiles in columns are distinct).  \n- Result: Tiles cluster upward, but no new merges are set up.  \n\n#### DOWN Swipe:\n- Columns shift down. After shifting, row 3 (bottom row) becomes `0|4|4|16` (from `0|4|0|16`). This creates two adjacent 4s in row 3, columns 1 and 2.  \n- Result: The 4s in row 3 can merge in the next move (e.g., with a subsequent LEFT swipe), setting up a future score increase. Larger tiles (e.g., 32 in row 0, column 3) remain in the bottom-right corner, a strategic position.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move because it creates adjacent 4s in the bottom row, enabling a merge in the next move. This aligns with the strategy of clustering smaller tiles to set up future merges while keeping larger tiles in a corner.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board for each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and evaluate the resulting board state and potential for future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|16|0|32  \nRow 1: 0|0|2|16  \nRow 2: 0|16|32|2  \nRow 3: 0|4|4|16  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Tiles shift left, merging adjacent equal values.  \n  - Row 0: [0,16,0,32] → [16,32,0,0] (no merges).  \n  - Row 1: [0,0,2,16] → [2,16,0,0] (no merges).  \n  - Row 2: [0,16,32,2] → [16,32,2,0] (no merges).  \n  - Row 3: [0,4,4,16] → [8,16,0,0] (merges 4+4=8, score +8).  \n- **Score**: 8.  \n- **Board State**: Larger tiles (32, 16) are spread out; limited future merge potential.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Tiles shift right, merging adjacent equal values.  \n  - Row 0: [0,16,0,32] → [0,0,16,32] (no merges).  \n  - Row 1: [0,0,2,16] → [0,0,2,16] (no merges).  \n  - Row 2: [0,16,32,2] → [0,16,32,2] (no merges).  \n  - Row 3: [0,4,4,16] → [0,0,8,16] (merges 4+4=8, score +8).  \n- **Score**: 8.  \n- **Board State**: Similar to LEFT; larger tiles remain spread out.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Tiles shift up, merging adjacent equal values in columns.  \n  - Column 1: [16 (Row 0), 0 (Row 1), 16 (Row 2), 4 (Row 3)] → merges 16+16=32 (score +32), resulting in [32,4,0,0].  \n  - Column 2: [0 (Row 0), 2 (Row 1), 32 (Row 2), 4 (Row 3)] → [2,32,4,0] (no merges).  \n  - Columns 0 and 3: No merges.  \n- **Score**: 32.  \n- **Board State**:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 0|32|2|32  \n  Row 1: 0|4|32|16  \n  Row 2: 0|0|4|2  \n  Row 3: 0|0|0|16  \n  ```  \n  - Two 32s in Row 0 (columns 1 and 3) are positioned to merge if swiped RIGHT next, creating a 64 (high-value tile).  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles shift down, merging adjacent equal values in columns.  \n  - Column 1: [16 (Row 0), 0 (Row 1), 16 (Row 2), 4 (Row 3)] → merges 16+16=32 (score +32), resulting in [0,32,0,4].  \n  - Columns 0, 2, and 3: No merges.  \n- **Score**: 32.  \n- **Board State**:  \n  ```\n  Row 0: 0|0|0|32  \n  Row 1: 0|32|2|16  \n  Row 2: 0|0|32|2  \n  Row 3: 0|4|4|16  \n  ```  \n  - 32s are diagonally placed (Row 1, Column 1 and Row 2, Column 2), making future merges less likely compared to UP.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nUP provides the highest immediate score (32) and positions two 32s in the same row (Row 0), setting up for a potential 64 merge on the next RIGHT swipe. This strategic alignment of larger tiles in a row is more favorable for future moves than the diagonal placement in DOWN.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current game board and strategic goals (merging tiles, grouping large tiles, and setting up future merges). The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 0|32|2|32\nRow 1: 0|4|32|16\nRow 2: 16|0|4|2\nRow 3: 0|0|0|16\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. The resulting board would have tiles grouped left but no adjacent equal tiles to merge immediately. Example row 0 becomes `32|2|32|0`, with 32s separated by a 2. No score gain.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Tiles shift right, but no merges occur. The board remains mostly unchanged, with tiles spread out. Example row 2 becomes `0|16|4|2`, with no adjacent equal tiles. No score gain.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Tiles shift up, but no merges occur. The largest tile (16 in row 2, column 0) moves to row 0, column 0, but other tiles remain spread out. No score gain.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Tiles shift down. Key observations:  \n   - Column 0: 16 (row 2) moves to row 3, column 0.  \n   - Column 1: 32 (row 0) and 4 (row 1) move to row 2 and row 3, column 1.  \n   - Column 2: 2 (row 0), 32 (row 1), and 4 (row 2) move to row 1, row 2, and row 3, column 2.  \n   - Column 3: 32 (row 0), 16 (row 1), 2 (row 2), and 16 (row 3) shift down, with 16s in row 1 and row 3 of column 3 becoming adjacent in row 2 and row 3 (though no merge in this move).  \n\n   After shifting down, the board becomes:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 0|0|0|32  \n   Row 1: 0|0|2|16  \n   Row 2: 0|32|32|2  \n   Row 3: 16|4|4|16  \n   ```  \n   Notably, row 2 now has adjacent 32s (column 1 and 2), and row 3 has adjacent 4s (column 1 and 2). These set up future merges (e.g., LEFT move after DOWN would merge the 32s and 4s, generating score).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN groups critical tiles (32s and 4s) into adjacent positions, creating opportunities for future merges. This aligns with the strategy of positioning large tiles for merging.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic placement of large tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 4 | 0 | 0 | 32  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 2 | 16  \nRow 2: 0 | 32 | 32 | 2  \nRow 3: 16 | 4 | 4 | 16  \n\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### 1. Swipe LEFT:\n- **Row 0**: [4, 0, 0, 32] → Tiles shift left to [4, 32, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 2, 16] → Tiles shift left to [2, 16, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [0, 32, 32, 2] → 32 and 32 merge into 64 (score +64), then 2 shifts left → [64, 2, 0, 0].  \n- **Row 3**: [16, 4, 4, 16] → 4 and 4 merge into 8 (score +8), then 16 shifts left → [16, 8, 16, 0].  \n\n**Resulting Board**:  \nRow 0: 4 | 32 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 2 | 16 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 64 | 2 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 16 | 8 | 16 | 0  \n\n**Score Gain**: 64 (from 32+32) + 8 (from 4+4) = 72. Large tile 64 is placed in the bottom-left corner (row 2, column 0), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in a corner.\n\n\n#### 2. Swipe RIGHT:\n- **Row 0**: [4, 0, 0, 32] → Tiles shift right to [0, 0, 4, 32] (no merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 0, 2, 16] → Tiles shift right to [0, 0, 2, 16] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [0, 32, 32, 2] → 32 and 32 merge into 64 (score +64), then 2 shifts right → [0, 0, 64, 2].  \n- **Row 3**: [16, 4, 4, 16] → 4 and 4 merge into 8 (score +8), then 16 shifts right → [0, 16, 8, 16].  \n\n**Resulting Board**:  \nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 4 | 32  \nRow 1: 0 | 0 | 2 | 16  \nRow 2: 0 | 0 | 64 | 2  \nRow 3: 0 | 16 | 8 | 16  \n\n**Score Gain**: 64 + 8 = 72 (same as LEFT). However, the large tile 64 is placed in row 2, column 2 (not a corner), which is less strategic than LEFT.\n\n\n#### 3. Swipe UP:\n- Columns are processed top to bottom. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges.  \n**Score Gain**: 0.  \n\n\n#### 4. Swipe DOWN:\n- Columns are processed bottom to top. No adjacent equal tiles in any column, so no merges.  \n**Score Gain**: 0.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 72 points, but LEFT places the largest new tile (64) in a corner (row 2, column 0), aligning with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in corners for future merges. UP and DOWN provide no merges and are suboptimal.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and the effect of each possible swipe direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the rules and strategic goals (e.g., merging tiles, keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 32 | 0 | 0\nRow 1: 2 | 16 | 0 | 0\nRow 2: 64 | 2 | 4 | 0\nRow 3: 16 | 8 | 16 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles in rows are distinct). Tiles are already as left as possible, so no meaningful movement. **No merges or useful shifts.**\n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift right, filling empty spaces on the right. For example:  \n   - Row 0: `[4, 32, 0, 0]` → `[0, 0, 4, 32]`  \n   - Row 1: `[2, 16, 0, 0]` → `[0, 0, 2, 16]`  \n   - Row 2: `[64, 2, 4, 0]` → `[0, 64, 2, 4]`  \n   - Row 3: `[16, 8, 16, 0]` → `[0, 16, 8, 16]`  \n   While tiles move, no merges occur, and large tiles (e.g., 64, 32) are spread out, which is suboptimal for corner-based strategies.\n\n3. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift down, but no movement occurs. All tiles are already as low as possible (no empty spaces below them in their columns), and no adjacent equal tiles exist vertically. **Invalid move (no tiles shift).**\n\n4. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift up, with meaningful movement in Column 2:  \n   - Column 2: `[0, 0, 4, 16]` → `[4, 16, 0, 0]` (4 moves from Row 2 to Row 0; 16 moves from Row 3 to Row 1).  \n   This results in the board:  \n   ```\n   Row 0: 4 | 32 | 4 | 0  \n   Row 1: 2 | 16 | 16 | 0  \n   Row 2: 64 | 2 | 0 | 0  \n   Row 3: 16 | 8 | 0 | 0  \n   ```  \n   Notably, Row 1 now has adjacent 16s (columns 1 and 2), which can merge with a subsequent LEFT swipe, creating a 32. Additionally, the largest tile (64) remains in the corner (Row 2, Column 0), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUP is the best move, as it sets up future merges (e.g., the 16s in Row 1) and keeps large tiles (64) in a corner.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize immediate score and set up future merges.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 32 | 4 | 0\nRow 1: 2 | 16 | 16 | 4\nRow 2: 64 | 2 | 0 | 0\nRow 3: 16 | 8 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles `[4, 32, 4, 0]` shift left. No merges (all distinct), so row remains `[4, 32, 4, 0]`.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `[2, 16, 16, 4]` shift left. The two `16`s merge into `32` (score +32), and the row becomes `[2, 32, 4, 0]`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `[64, 2, 0, 0]` are already leftmost; no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `[16, 8, 0, 0]` are already leftmost; no merges.  \n\n**Result**: Score +32. The board after LEFT swipe has merged `16`s into `32` in Row 1, and the `32` in Row 0 (Column 1) now aligns vertically with the new `32` in Row 1 (Column 1), setting up a potential future merge (e.g., swiping UP next to merge these `32`s into `64`).\n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**  \n- **Row 0**: Tiles `[4, 32, 4, 0]` shift right to `[0, 4, 32, 4]`; no merges.  \n- **Row 1**: Tiles `[2, 16, 16, 4]` shift right. The two `16`s merge into `32` (score +32), and the row becomes `[0, 2, 32, 4]`.  \n- **Row 2**: Tiles `[64, 2, 0, 0]` shift right to `[0, 0, 64, 2]`; no merges.  \n- **Row 3**: Tiles `[16, 8, 0, 0]` shift right to `[0, 0, 16, 8]`; no merges.  \n\n**Result**: Score +32. However, the merged `32` in Row 1 (Column 2) does not align as well with existing tiles for future merges compared to the LEFT swipe.\n\n#### **UP Swipe**  \n- Columns are processed top to bottom. All tiles are distinct or separated by zeros, so no merges occur.  \n**Result**: Score +0. No immediate benefit.\n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**  \n- Columns are processed bottom to top. Tiles shift down but remain distinct, so no merges occur.  \n**Result**: Score +0. No immediate benefit.\n\n### Conclusion  \nLEFT and RIGHT both yield +32 score, but LEFT strategically aligns the `32` in Row 0 (Column 1) with the new `32` in Row 1 (Column 1), creating a vertical pair that can merge in future moves (e.g., swiping UP).

Result: `4|16|0|0` (score +16).\n- **Row 3**: `8|64|64|32` shifts left, merging the two `64`s into `128`. Result: `8|128|32|0` (score +128).\n\n**Post-LEFT Board**:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 16|0|0|0\nRow 2: 4|16|0|0\nRow 3: 8|128|32|0\n```\nTotal score gain: 16 + 128 = 144. Larger tiles (`128`, `16`) are positioned on the left, a strategic corner.\n\n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros; no change.\n- **Row 1**: `16|0|0|0` shifts right to `0|0|0|16` (no merge).\n- **Row 2**: `4|0|8|8` shifts right, merging the two `8`s into `16`. Result: `0|4|0|16` (score +16).\n- **Row 3**: `8|64|64|32` shifts right, merging the two `64`s into `128`. Result: `0|8|128|32` (score +128).\n\n**Post-RIGHT Board**:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|0|0|16\nRow 2: 0|4|0|16\nRow 3: 0|8|128|32\n```\nTotal score gain: 16 + 128 = 144. Larger tiles (`128`, `16`) are positioned on the right, but less centralized than LEFT.\n\n\n#### **UP Move**:\nTiles shift upward. No merges occur because no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. The board becomes:\n```\nRow 0: 16|64|8|8\nRow 1: 4|0|64|32\nRow 2: 8|0|0|0\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\nNo score gain.\n\n\n#### **DOWN Move**:\nTiles shift downward. No merges occur because no adjacent equal tiles exist in any column. The board remains mostly unchanged, with minimal shifts. No score gain.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT and RIGHT both yield 144 points, but LEFT positions larger tiles (`128`, `16`) in the left corner, aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners for future merges. UP and DOWN provide no immediate score and are suboptimal.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential merges and strategic positioning of large tiles.

This positions two 16s adjacent in Row 0, creating a **future merge opportunity** (e.g., a subsequent LEFT swipe could merge these 16s into 32).\n\n### Strategic Choice:\nWhile no immediate merges occur in any direction, UP positions two 16s in the same row (Row 0), setting up a potential merge in the next move. This aligns with the strategy of grouping smaller tiles to facilitate future merges, which is critical for maximizing scores.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging potential, score gain, and strategic tile placement (e.g., keeping large tiles in corners).\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 16|16|32|8  \nRow 1: 4|128|0|0  \nRow 2: 8|0|0|2  \nRow 3: 0|0|0|0  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- **Row 0**: [16,16,32,8] → 16 and 16 merge into 32 (score +32). The row becomes [32, 32, 8, 0] (32s adjacent but cannot merge again in this move).  \n- **Row 1**: [4,128,0,0] → Shifts left to [4,128,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 2**: [8,0,0,2] → Shifts left to [8,2,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- Score gain: 32. Larger tiles (32, 128) are scattered; 128 is not in a corner.  \n\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- **Row 0**: [16,16,32,8] → 16 and 16 merge into 32 (score +32). The row becomes [0, 32, 32, 8] (32s adjacent, potential for future merges).  \n- **Row 1**: [4,128,0,0] → Shifts right to [0,0,4,128] (128 moves to the right corner, ideal for corner strategy).  \n- **Row 2**: [8,0,0,2] → Shifts right to [0,0,8,2] (tiles shift right, no merges).  \n- **Row 3**: Remains [0,0,0,0].  \n- Score gain: 32. Key improvement: 128 is now in the right corner (Row 1, Column 3), aligning with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners.  \n\n\n#### **UP**  \n- **Column 0**: [16,4,8,0] → Shifts up to [16,4,8,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [16,128,0,0] → Shifts up to [16,128,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [32,0,0,0] → Shifts up to [32,0,0,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [8,0,2,0] → Shifts up to [8,2,0,0] (no merges).  \n- No score gain. Tiles remain scattered; no strategic improvement.  \n\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- **Column 0**: [16,4,8,0] → Shifts down to [0,16,4,8] (no merges).  \n- **Column 1**: [16,128,0,0] → Shifts down to [0,128,16,0] (no merges).  \n- **Column 2**: [32,0,0,0] → Shifts down to [0,0,0,32] (no merges).  \n- **Column 3**: [8,0,2,0] → Shifts down to [0,0,8,2] (no merges).  \n- No score gain. Tiles are spread out; 128 is not in a corner.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nRIGHT is the best move. It merges 16s in Row 0 for a score of 32, shifts 128 to the right corner (Row 1, Column 3) (optimal for large tile placement), and positions 32s adjacently in Row 0 for potential future merges.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: [0, 32, 32, 8]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 4, 128]\nRow 2: [0, 64, 8, 2]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift left, merging the two 32s into 64. New row: `[64, 8, 0, 0]` (score +64).  \n   - Row 1: Tiles shift left to `[4, 128, 0, 0]` (no merge).  \n   - Row 2: Tiles shift left to `[64, 8, 2, 0]` (no merge).  \n   - Result: 128 (largest tile) moves to row 1, column 1 (left side).  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 0: Tiles shift right, merging the two 32s into 64. New row: `[0, 0, 8, 64]` (score +64).  \n   - Row 1: Tiles remain `[0, 0, 4, 128]` (no merge, 128 stays in row 1, column 3).  \n   - Row 2: Tiles shift right to `[0, 64, 8, 2]` (no merge).  \n   - Result: 128 (largest tile) stays in the right corner (row 1, column 3), which is strategically better for future merges.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom. No merges occur, as all adjacent tiles in columns are distinct.  \n   - Result: No score, and tile positions remain mostly unchanged.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom to top. No merges occur, as all adjacent tiles in columns are distinct.  \n   - Result: No score, and tile positions shift downward but do not improve strategic positioning.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT yield a merge (32+32=64, score +64). However, RIGHT keeps the largest tile (128) in the right corner, a key strategic position to avoid blocking future merges. This makes RIGHT the better choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate the outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down. The goal is to maximize future merging potential and keep larger tiles in strategic positions (e.g., corners).\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 64 | 8\nRow 1: 0 | 32 | 4 | 128\nRow 2: 0 | 64 | 8 | 2\nRow 3: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **RIGHT**: Tiles are already shifted to the rightmost possible positions in all rows (no tiles can move further right). This is an invalid move.  \n2. **LEFT**: Tiles shift left, but no merges occur (all adjacent tiles are distinct). The 128 (largest tile) moves from row 1, column 3 (corner) to row 1, column 2 (non-corner), which is suboptimal.  \n3. **UP**: Tiles shift up, but no merges occur. The 128 remains in row 1, column 3 (corner), but fewer tiles move compared to other valid directions, reducing future flexibility.  \n4. **DOWN**: Tiles shift down into the empty row (row 3). No merges occur immediately, but the 128 (largest tile) stays in column 3 (a corner column), and tiles are repositioned to potentially enable future merges. This move maintains the 128 in a strategic corner-adjacent position and uses the empty row effectively.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSwiping **DOWN** is the best move, as it keeps the largest tile (128) in a corner-adjacent column, repositions tiles to support future merges, and utilizes the empty row for better flexibility.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping left, right, up, or down, focusing on merging opportunities and maintaining larger tiles in corners.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\nRow 1: 32 | 0 | 64 | 8\nRow 2: 0 | 32 | 4 | 128\nRow 3: 0 | 64 | 8 | 2\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The largest tile is 128, located in the bottom-right corner (Row 2, Column 3). Keeping large tiles in corners is strategic for future merges.\n- No adjacent tiles of the same value exist initially, so valid moves depend on shifting tiles into empty spaces to set up future merges.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift left, but no merges occur. The 128 (Row 2, Column 3) moves to Row 2, Column 2, moving it away from the corner. This reduces the strategic positioning of large tiles.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift right. The 128 remains in the bottom-right corner (Row 2, Column 3), preserving its strategic position.  \n   - Row 1: [32, 0, 64, 8] → [0, 32, 64, 8] (32 moves to Column 1).  \n   - Row 2: [0, 32, 4, 128] → [0, 32, 4, 128] (no change, 128 stays in Column 3).  \n   - Row 3: [0, 64, 8, 2] → [0, 64, 8, 2] (no change).  \n   - After a right swipe, two 32s are positioned vertically in Column 1 (Row 1 and Row 2), setting up a potential merge if a subsequent down swipe is made.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift up. The 128 (Row 2, Column 3) moves to Row 1, Column 3, moving it away from the corner. No merges occur, and this disrupts the corner positioning of large tiles.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift down. The 32 in Row 1, Column 0 moves to Row 3, Column 0, but no merges occur. The 128 remains in the bottom-right corner, but this move does not set up future merges as effectively as the right swipe.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe right swipe preserves the 128 in the bottom-right corner and positions two 32s vertically in Column 1, creating a future merge opportunity. This aligns with the strategy of keeping large tiles in corners and setting up merges for higher scores.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN, focusing on score gain, tile positioning, and future merge opportunities.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nCurrent board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|32|64|8\nRow 2: 32|32|4|128\nRow 3: 0|64|8|2\n```\n\n### LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros, no change.\n- **Row 1**: [0,32,64,8] → [32,64,8,0] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [32,32,4,128] → [64,4,128,0] (merge 32+32=64, score +64).\n- **Row 3**: [0,64,8,2] → [64,8,2,0] (no merges).\n\nResulting board after LEFT:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 32|64|8|0\nRow 2: 64|4|128|0\nRow 3: 64|8|2|0\n```\nScore gain: 64.\n\n\n### RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: All zeros, no change.\n- **Row 1**: [0,32,64,8] → [0,32,64,8] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [32,32,4,128] → [0,64,4,128] (merge 32+32=64, score +64).\n- **Row 3**: [0,64,8,2] → [0,64,8,2] (no merges).\n\nResulting board after RIGHT:\n```\nRow 0: 0|0|0|0\nRow 1: 0|32|64|8\nRow 2: 0|64|4|128\nRow 3: 0|64|8|2\n```\nScore gain: 64.\n\n\n### UP Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: [0,0,32,0] → [32,0,0,0] (shift 32 up).\n- **Column 1**: [0,32,32,64] → [64,64,0,0] (merge 32+32=64, score +64).\n- **Column 2**: [0,64,4,8] → [64,4,8,0] (shift up, no merges).\n- **Column 3**: [0,8,128,2] → [8,128,2,0] (shift up, no merges).\n\nResulting board after UP:\n```\nRow 0: 32|64|64|8\nRow 1: 0|64|4|128\nRow 2: 0|0|8|2\nRow 3: 0|0|0|0\n```\nScore gain: 64.

The 128 remains in the middle (Row 2, Column 3), with less strategic positioning.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions yield 64 score, but UP is optimal. It positions the 128 in the top-right area (Row 1, Column 3) and creates adjacent 64s in Row 0 (Columns 1-2), enabling future merges (e.g., LEFT swipe next to merge 64+64=128).

However, UP places the merged 256 tile in the top row (row 0, column 2) and 16 in row 0, column 3. This positions larger tiles in the upper part of the grid, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in a corner for future merges. DOWN places 256 in row 2, column 2 and 16 in row 3, column 3, which is less optimal for building a corner stack. Thus, UP is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning.\n\n### Current Game Board:\nRow 0: 2 | 32 | 256 | 16  \nRow 1: 64 | 4 | 0 | 0  \nRow 2: 16 | 2 | 0 | 0  \nRow 3: 32 | 0 | 0 | 4  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows are processed leftward. No adjacent tiles in any row are equal, so no merging occurs. Tiles shift left but remain in their original order. No score is gained.  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   - All rows are processed rightward. No adjacent tiles in any row are equal, so no merging occurs. Tiles shift right but remain in their original order. No score is gained.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - All columns are processed upward. No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, so no merging occurs. Tiles shift up but remain in their original order. No score is gained.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - All columns are processed downward. No adjacent tiles in any column are equal, so no merging occurs immediately. However, the largest tile (256) in Row 0, Column 2 shifts down to Row 3, Column 2. This positions the 256 in the bottom row, aligning with the strategy of keeping larger tiles in corners or stable rows for future merges.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nWhile no immediate merges occur in any direction, the DOWN swipe moves the largest tile (256) to the bottom row, which is more stable and aligns with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in a corner or edge for future merging opportunities. This positioning improves long-term potential for higher scores.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential, board structure, and future move opportunities. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 2|0|0|0\nRow 1: 64|32|2|0\nRow 2: 16|4|0|16\nRow 3: 32|2|256|4\n```\n\n### LEFT Swipe Analysis:\n- **Row 0**: [2,0,0,0] → Shifts left to [2,0,0,0] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [64,32,2,0] → Shifts left to [64,32,2,0] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [16,4,0,16] → Shifts left to [16,4,16,0] (no merges, 16s are separated by 4).\n- **Row 3**: [32,2,256,4] → Already left-aligned, no changes (no merges).\n\n### RIGHT Swipe Analysis:\n- **Row 0**: [2,0,0,0] → Shifts right to [0,0,0,2] (no merges).\n- **Row 1**: [64,32,2,0] → Shifts right to [0,64,32,2] (no merges).\n- **Row 2**: [16,4,0,16] → Shifts right to [0,16,4,16] (no merges, 16s are separated by 4).\n- **Row 3**: [32,2,256,4] → Already right-aligned, no changes (no merges).\n\n### UP Swipe Analysis:\n- **Column 0**: [2,64,16,32] → No 0s, remains [2,64,16,32] (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [0,32,4,2] → Shifts up to [32,4,2,0] (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: [0,2,0,256] → Shifts up to [2,256,0,0] (no merges).\n- **Column 3**: [0,0,16,4] → Shifts up to [16,4,0,0] (no merges).\n\n### DOWN Swipe Analysis:\n- **Column 0**: [2,64,16,32] → No 0s, remains [2,64,16,32] (no merges).\n- **Column 1**: [0,32,4,2] → Shifts down to [0,32,4,2] (no merges).\n- **Column 2**: [0,2,0,256] → Shifts down to [0,0,2,256] (no merges).\n- **Column 3**: [0,0,16,4] → Shifts down to [0,0,16,4] (no merges).\n\n### Key Observations:\nNone of the directions result in immediate tile merges. The priority shifts to preserving empty spaces (to avoid grid lock) and positioning larger tiles for future merges. LEFT swipe maintains 5 empty spaces (row0: cols1-3; row1: col3; row2: col3), which is better than RIGHT (4 empty spaces). LEFT also keeps larger tiles (64, 32, 256) in positions that allow future alignment for merges (e.g., 16s in row2 may align if a new tile spawns in col3).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic positioning of tiles. The goal is to maximize future merging potential and keep larger tiles in a corner.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nRow 1: 64 | 32 | 2 | 0  \nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 16 | 128  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 256 | 4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   - Row 0: [2, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts left to [2, 0, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [64, 32, 2, 0] → Shifts left to [64, 32, 2, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [16, 4, 16, 128] → No merges (16s are separated by 4).  \n   - Row 3: [32, 2, 256, 4] → No merges (all tiles are distinct).  \n   - Result: No merges, minimal tile movement.\n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   - Row 0: [2, 0, 0, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 0, 0, 2] (no merges).  \n   - Row 1: [64, 32, 2, 0] → Shifts right to [0, 64, 32, 2] (no merges).  \n   - Row 2: [16, 4, 16, 128] → No merges (tiles remain separated).  \n   - Row 3: [32, 2, 256, 4] → No merges (tiles remain in place).  \n   - Result: Tiles shift right, keeping larger tiles (256, 128) in the right half of the grid, which aligns with the strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner.\n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   - Columns are processed top to bottom.  \n   - Column 0: [2, 64, 16, 32] → No merges (all distinct).  \n   - Column 1: [0, 32, 4, 2] → Shifts up to [32, 4, 2, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [0, 2, 16, 256] → Shifts up to [2, 16, 256, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [0, 0, 128, 4] → Shifts up to [128, 4, 0, 0] (no merges).  \n   - Result: Large tiles (128) move upward, disrupting the bottom-right concentration.\n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   - Columns are processed bottom to top.  \n   - Column 0: [2, 64, 16, 32] → No merges (all distinct).  \n   - Column 1: [0, 32, 4, 2] → Shifts down to [0, 32, 4, 2] (no merges).  \n   - Column 2: [0, 2, 16, 256] → Shifts down to [0, 2, 16, 256] (no merges).  \n   - Column 3: [0, 0, 128, 4] → Shifts down to [0, 0, 128, 4] (no merges).  \n   - Result: No meaningful shifts or merges; large tiles remain scattered.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the moves result in immediate merges. However, the RIGHT move strategically positions tiles to keep larger values (256, 128) in the right half of the grid, aligning with the 2048 strategy of concentrating large tiles in a corner for future merging opportunities.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The goal is to maximize score through merging and maintain a favorable board state for future moves.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 0|8|0|2  \nRow 1: 0|64|32|2  \nRow 2: 16|4|16|128  \nRow 3: 32|2|256|4  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT**:  \n   - Swiping LEFT or RIGHT does not result in any merges. Tiles in each row either have no adjacent duplicates or no empty spaces to shift into, leaving the board largely unchanged. These moves provide no score and do not improve the board state.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - Swiping UP merges the two 2s in Column 3 (Row 0 and Row 1) into a 4 (score +4). However, the resulting board has fewer empty spaces (Row 0 becomes `16|8|32|4` with no zeros), limiting future movement options. Larger tiles (e.g., 256 in Row 2, Column 2) are not positioned in a corner, which is suboptimal for long-term strategy.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   - Swiping DOWN also merges the two 2s in Column 3 (Row 0 and Row 1) into a 4 (score +4). After merging, the board retains more empty spaces (Row 0 becomes `0|8|0|0` with three zeros), which is critical for future tile movement and merging. Additionally, larger tiles like 256 (Row 3, Column 2) and 128 (Row 2, Column 3) are positioned closer to the bottom-right corner, aligning with the strategy of consolidating large tiles in corners for better control.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the best move. It merges the only available pair of tiles (the two 2s), maintains critical empty spaces for future moves, and positions larger tiles closer to a corner, enhancing long-term strategic potential.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate the potential outcomes of swiping LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

No merges.  \n\n#### **RIGHT Swipe**:\n- **Row 0**: [128, 8, 0, 0] → Tiles shift right to [0, 0, 128, 8] (minor movement).  \n- **Row 1**: [0, 64, 32, 4] → Tiles are already right-aligned; no movement.  \n- **Row 2**: [16, 4, 16, 128] → No empty spaces to shift into; no movement.  \n- **Row 3**: [32, 2, 256, 4] → No empty spaces to shift into; no movement.  \n- **Outcome**: Only Row 0 shifts right. No merges.  \n\n#### **UP Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [128, 0, 16, 32] → Tiles shift up to [128, 16, 32, 0] (movement).  \n- **Column 1**: [8, 64, 4, 2] → Tiles are already top-aligned; no movement.  \n- **Column 2**: [0, 32, 16, 256] → Tiles shift up to [32, 16, 256, 0] (movement).  \n- **Column 3**: [0, 4, 128, 4] → Tiles shift up to [4, 128, 4, 0] (movement).  \n- **Outcome**: Columns 0, 2, and 3 shift up. No merges, but significant movement creates space in the bottom row.  \n\n#### **DOWN Swipe**:\n- **Column 0**: [128, 0, 16, 32] → Tiles shift down to [0, 128, 16, 32] (movement).  \n- **Column 1**: [8, 64, 4, 2] → Tiles shift down to [64, 4, 2, 8] (movement).  \n- **Column 2**: [0, 32, 16, 256] → Tiles are already bottom-aligned; no movement.  \n- **Column 3**: [0, 4, 128, 4] → Tiles are already bottom-aligned; no movement.  \n- **Outcome**: Columns 0 and 1 shift down. Less movement compared to UP.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP swipe results in the most movement (columns 0, 2, and 3 shift), creating space in the bottom row and positioning tiles for potential future merges.

Score: +8.  \n\n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift up in each column, merging adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - All columns (0-3) contain distinct values. No merges occur. Score: +0.  \n\n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   - Tiles shift down in each column, merging adjacent equal tiles.  \n   - All columns (0-3) contain distinct values. No merges occur. Score: +0.  \n\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT swipes yield 8 points from merging the two 4s in Row 3. Strategically, keeping larger tiles in corners is prioritized. The largest tile (256) is in Row 2, Column 2. Swiping LEFT places the merged 8 in Row 3, Column 2 (below 256), while swiping RIGHT places it in Row 3, Column 3 (a corner). However, merging the 4s in Row 3 is the only immediate opportunity, and LEFT is chosen as it maintains better alignment for potential future merges with the 256 tile.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile placement. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 4|8|32|0  \nRow 1: 128|64|16|4  \nRow 2: 16|4|256|128  \nRow 3: 32|2|8|8  \n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The only adjacent tiles with the same number are the two 8s in Row 3 (columns 2 and 3). Merging these 8s into a 16 will yield 16 points.\n- Larger tiles (e.g., 256, 128, 64) are spread across the grid, with 256 in Row 2, column 2. Strategic moves should aim to keep larger tiles in corners or align smaller tiles for future merges.\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n1. **UP**: No columns have adjacent duplicates, and all columns are fully occupied. No merges occur, making this direction ineffective.  \n2. **DOWN**: Similarly, no columns have adjacent duplicates, and all columns are fully occupied. No merges occur here either.  \n3. **RIGHT**: Swiping right shifts tiles in each row to the right. For Row 3: [32, 2, 8, 8] → [0, 32, 2, 16] (merging the 8s into 16). Other rows (Rows 0-2) have distinct tiles and shift right without merging. This results in a merge but places the new 16 in the rightmost column (column 3), adjacent to 128 in Row 2, column 3 (no immediate benefit).  \n4. **LEFT**: Swiping left shifts tiles in each row to the left. For Row 3: [32, 2, 8, 8] → [32, 2, 16, 0] (merging the 8s into 16). Other rows (Rows 0-2) have distinct tiles and remain left-aligned without merging. This places the new 16 in column 2, below 256 in Row 2, column 2 (potentially aligning for future merges). The 0 in Row 3, column 3 also keeps empty space in the right, which is less disruptive to larger tiles in the left and center.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is preferred because it merges the 8s into 16 (yielding 16 points), maintains larger tiles (e.g., 256, 128) in stable positions, and positions the new 16 in a column that could support future merges with larger tiles.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile merges, score gain, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 8 | 32 | 4  \nRow 1: 128 | 64 | 16 | 4  \nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 256 | 128  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 16 | 0  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows are full (no empty tiles), and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. No merges occur. No score gain.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - All rows are full (no empty tiles), and no adjacent tiles in any row are equal. No merges occur. No score gain.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 3 (tiles: 4, 4, 128, 0) has two adjacent 4s. When moving up, these 4s merge into 8 (score +8). The merged 8 occupies row 0, column 3, and the 128 shifts up to row 1, column 3. This leaves two empty tiles in row 2, column 3 and row 3, column 3.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 3 (tiles: 4, 4, 128, 0) has two adjacent 4s. When moving down, the 4s shift toward the bottom and merge into 8 (score +8). The merged 8 occupies row 2, column 3, and the 128 shifts down to row 3, column 3 (a corner position). This leaves two empty tiles in row 0, column 3 and row 1, column 3.  \n\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- Both UP and DOWN yield a score of 8 from merging the 4s in column 3.  \n- The DOWN move positions the 128 tile in the bottom-right corner (row 3, column 3), which is a strategic corner for larger tiles. This helps maintain a centralized structure for future merges (e.g., potential merging of 256 in row 2, column 2 with a future 256 in row 3, column 3).  \n\nThus, the optimal move is **DOWN**.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on potential tile movement, merges, and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board is:\n```\nRow 0: 4|8|32|128\nRow 1: 128|64|16|0\nRow 2: 16|4|256|8\nRow 3: 32|2|16|128\n```\nKey observations:\n- No adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) have the same value, so no immediate merges are possible.\n- There is one empty tile (0) at (Row 1, Column 3). Valid moves require tiles to shift into this empty space.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Each Direction:\n#### **LEFT**  \n- Tiles shift left, but all non-zero tiles in each row are already as far left as possible. No movement or merges occur. **Not useful**.\n\n#### **RIGHT**  \n- Tiles shift right. Only Row 1 (128|64|16|0) has an empty tile. Swiping right shifts 16 into the empty space, resulting in Row 1: 0|128|64|16. No merges. Moves a small tile (16) into the empty space. **Limited utility**.\n\n#### **UP**  \n- Tiles shift up. Only Column 3 (128|0|8|128) has an empty tile. Swiping up shifts 8 (Row 2, Column 3) into the empty space, resulting in Column 3: 128|8|128|0. No merges. Moves a small tile (8) into the empty space. **Limited utility**.\n\n#### **DOWN**  \n- Tiles shift down. Only Column 3 (128|0|8|128) has an empty tile. Swiping down shifts 128 (Row 0, Column 3) into the empty space, resulting in Column 3: 0|128|8|128. No merges, but this moves the largest tile (128) into the empty space. This positions two 128s in Column 3 (Row 1 and Row 3), separated by 8, which could set up future merges if the 8 is moved. **Strategically better** as it prioritizes larger tile positioning.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAmong the options, **DOWN** is the best move. It shifts the largest available tile (128) into the empty space, improving the potential for future merges by aligning larger tiles in a column.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and strategic tile positioning. The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 4|8|32|2\nRow 1: 128|64|16|128\nRow 2: 16|4|256|8\nRow 3: 32|2|16|128\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles, 0s).\n- Valid moves require either adjacent tiles with the same number (to merge) or empty spaces (to shift tiles). Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend on adjacent equal tiles.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   All rows are checked for adjacent equal tiles. None of the rows (4|8|32|2, 128|64|16|128, 16|4|256|8, 32|2|16|128) have adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and tiles do not shift (grid remains unchanged).  \n\n2. **RIGHT Swipe**:  \n   Similarly, all rows are checked for adjacent equal tiles when shifted right. None of the rows have adjacent equal tiles after shifting. No merges occur, and the grid remains unchanged.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   Columns are checked for adjacent equal tiles when shifted up. Columns (4|128|16|32, 8|64|4|2, 32|16|256|16, 2|128|8|128) have no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and the grid remains unchanged.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Columns are checked for adjacent equal tiles when shifted down. Columns (4|128|16|32, 8|64|4|2, 32|16|256|16, 2|128|8|128) also have no adjacent equal tiles. No merges occur, and the grid remains unchanged.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions result in no valid merges or tile shifts because the grid is full, and there are no adjacent equal tiles. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, a strategic choice (e.g., aligning larger tiles for future merges) is needed. The 256 tile in row 2, column 2 and 128 tiles in row 1\/3, column 3 suggest positioning larger tiles in the bottom-right corner, making a **DOWN** swipe marginally preferable.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) for potential tile merges and strategic positioning of larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 8 | 32 | 2\nRow 1: 128 | 64 | 16 | 128\nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 256 | 8\nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 16 | 128\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All rows have distinct adjacent tiles with no empty spaces. No merges occur, and tiles remain in place. No score gain.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 1: [128, 64, 16, 128]. When swiping right, the two 128s in columns 0 and 3 shift right, becoming adjacent in columns 2 and 3. They merge into 256, yielding a score of 256.  \n   - Other rows have no merges.  \n   While this merges two 128s, it does not set up further high-value merges.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   All columns have distinct adjacent tiles with no empty spaces. No merges occur, and tiles remain in place. No score gain.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - Column 3: [2, 128, 8, 128]. When swiping down, the two 128s in rows 1 and 3 shift down, becoming adjacent in rows 2 and 3. They merge into 256, yielding a score of 256.  \n   - Additionally, after merging, row 2 becomes [16, 4, 256, 256]. This creates adjacent 256s in row 2, which can be merged into 512 in a subsequent move (e.g., swiping right), setting up a high-value merge opportunity.  \n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nThe DOWN move not only merges two 128s (yielding 256) but also positions two 256s in row 2, enabling a future merge into 512. This strategic setup is more valuable than the RIGHT move, which only merges 128s without such follow-up potential.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile movement.

The 128 in row1 (column3) moves down past 8 (row2, column3) to row3 (column3), where it merges with the 128 in row3 (column3).

No merges.\n- **Column 2**: [32,16,256,16] – The two 16s in rows 1 and 3 of column 2 could potentially merge if shifted downward. However, due to the 256 in row 2, they are not adjacent after shifting. No merges.\n- **Column 3**: [2,128,8,128] – The two 128s in rows 1 and 3 of column 3 could potentially merge if shifted downward. However, the 8 in row 2 prevents adjacency. No merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves result in no merges, as there are no adjacent tiles of the same value, and the grid is full (no empty spaces to shift tiles into). Despite this, the problem requires selecting a direction. Based on strategic alignment (e.g., larger tiles like 256 and 128 are already in corners), a downward move is chosen to maintain potential future merging opportunities.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate potential merges or shifts for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The grid has no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles of the same value. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 8 | 32 | 2\nRow 1: 128 | 64 | 16 | 128\nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 256 | 8\nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 16 | 128\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT Move**:  \n   Tiles shift left. All rows have distinct values (no adjacent duplicates). For example:  \n   - Row 1: `128 | 64 | 16 | 128` → No merges (128s are not adjacent).  \n   - Other rows (0, 2, 3) also have no merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges.\n\n2. **RIGHT Move**:  \n   Tiles shift right. All rows have distinct values (no adjacent duplicates). For example:  \n   - Row 1: `128 | 64 | 16 | 128` → No merges (128s are not adjacent).  \n   - Other rows (0, 2, 3) also have no merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges.\n\n3. **UP Move**:  \n   Tiles shift up. All columns have distinct values (no adjacent duplicates). For example:  \n   - Column 3: `2 | 128 | 8 | 128` → No merges (128s are separated by 8).  \n   - Other columns (0, 1, 2) also have no merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges.\n\n4. **DOWN Move**:  \n   Tiles shift down. All columns have distinct values (no adjacent duplicates). For example:  \n   - Column 3: `2 | 128 | 8 | 128` → No merges (128s are separated by 8).  \n   - Other columns (0, 1, 2) also have no merges.  \n   **Result**: No merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full (no empty tiles), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same value in any row or column. This means no valid merges are possible in any direction. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Since all directions are invalid but the game has not yet ended (epoch 61 < 100), a direction must still be chosen. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and evaluate the potential merges and score gains for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 8 | 32 | 2\nRow 1: 128 | 64 | 16 | 128\nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 256 | 8\nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 16 | 128\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   All rows have no adjacent equal tiles, and no empty spaces (zeros) to shift tiles into. No merges or movement occur. **Invalid**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Row 1: The two 128s (positions (1,0) and (1,3)) could potentially merge if shifted right. However, when processing the row, the 128s are not adjacent after shifting, so no merge occurs.  \n   Other rows have no adjacent equal tiles. **No merges**. **Invalid**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   - Column 3: The two 128s (positions (1,3) and (3,3)) could merge if shifted up, but the 8 in (2,3) blocks adjacency.  \n   Other columns have no adjacent equal tiles. **No merges**. **Invalid**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - **Column 2**: Contains 16 (row 1, column 2) and 16 (row 3, column 2). When swiped down, these 16s shift toward the bottom, becoming adjacent and merging into 32 (score +32).  \n   - **Column 3**: Contains 128 (row 1, column 3) and 128 (row 3, column 3). When swiped down, these 128s shift toward the bottom, becoming adjacent and merging into 256 (score +256).  \n   These merges are valid and result in a total score gain of 32 + 256 = 288.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only valid move with merges is **DOWN**, as it enables two key merges (16s in column 2 and 128s in column 3) for the highest score gain.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible merges for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to identify a direction that allows merging tiles to increase the score, as merging is the primary way to gain points and avoid game over.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current game board is:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 8 | 32 | 2\nRow 1: 128 | 64 | 16 | 128\nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 256 | 8\nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 16 | 128\n```\nAll tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same value. We check for potential merges in each direction:\n\n#### LEFT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [4, 8, 32, 2] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Row 1**: [128, 64, 16, 128] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Row 2**: [16, 4, 256, 8] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Row 3**: [32, 2, 16, 128] – No adjacent duplicates.  \n  **Result**: No merges.\n\n#### RIGHT Swipe:\n- **Row 0**: [4, 8, 32, 2] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Row 1**: [128, 64, 16, 128] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Row 2**: [16, 4, 256, 8] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Row 3**: [32, 2, 16, 128] – No adjacent duplicates.  \n  **Result**: No merges.\n\n#### UP Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: [4, 128, 16, 32] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Column 1**: [8, 64, 4, 2] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Column 2**: [32, 16, 256, 16] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Column 3**: [2, 128, 8, 128] – No adjacent duplicates.  \n  **Result**: No merges.\n\n#### DOWN Swipe:\n- **Column 0**: [4, 128, 16, 32] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Column 1**: [8, 64, 4, 2] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Column 2**: [32, 16, 256, 16] – No adjacent duplicates.\n- **Column 3**: [2, 128, 8, 128] – No adjacent duplicates.  \n  **Result**: No merges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full (no empty tiles), and there are no adjacent tiles with the same value. By the game rules, this means no valid moves remain. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, and no merges are possible in any direction, the choice is arbitrary. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for potential merges or shifts in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). A valid move requires either merging adjacent equal tiles or shifting tiles into empty spaces. The current grid has no empty tiles (all 16 tiles are occupied), so valid moves depend on adjacent equal tiles.\n\n### Current Game Board:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 8 | 32 | 2  \nRow 1: 128 | 64 | 16 | 128  \nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 16 | 128  \n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   - All rows are full (no zeros).

For each column:  \n     - Column 0: [4, 128, 16, 32] (no adjacent equals).  \n     - Column 1: [8, 64, 4, 2] (no adjacent equals).  \n     - Column 2: [32, 16, 256, 16] (16s are separated by 256, not adjacent).  \n     - Column 3: [2, 128, 8, 128] (128s are separated by 8, not adjacent).  \n   - No merges or shifts occur. **Invalid move**.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   - All columns are full (no zeros). For each column:  \n     - Column 0: [4, 128, 16, 32] (no adjacent equals).  \n     - Column 1: [8, 64, 4, 2] (no adjacent equals).  \n     - Column 2: [32, 16, 256, 16] (16s are separated by 256, not adjacent).  \n     - Column 3: [2, 128, 8, 128] (128s are separated by 8, not adjacent).  \n   - No merges or shifts occur. **Invalid move**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full, and no adjacent tiles are equal in any direction. All moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are invalid. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the answer defaults to **DOWN** (a common strategic choice when no valid moves are apparent).\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the game board and potential outcomes for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The game board is fully occupied (no empty tiles), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same value. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4 | 8 | 32 | 2  \nRow 1: 128 | 64 | 16 | 128  \nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 16 | 128  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No adjacent duplicates**: All horizontally and vertically adjacent tiles have distinct values. For example:\n  - Row 1 has 128s at (1,0) and (1,3), but they are separated by 64 and 16.\n  - Column 3 has 128s at (1,3) and (3,3), but they are separated by 8.\n  - Column 2 has 16s at (1,2) and (3,2), but they are separated by 256.\n- **Grid is full**: There are no empty tiles (0s), so valid moves depend solely on merging adjacent duplicates. Since no such duplicates exist, no merges are possible in any direction.\n\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: Tiles in each row are already aligned to the edges (left for LEFT, right for RIGHT), and no merges occur.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: Tiles in each column are already aligned to the edges (top for UP, bottom for DOWN), and no merges occur.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves result in no merges. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, we choose a direction that minimally disrupts tile alignment (e.g., LEFT, as it maintains left-aligned tiles, a common strategy for future merges).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and check for valid merges or shifts that increase the score. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 8 | 32 | 2  \nRow 1: 128 | 64 | 16 | 128  \nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 16 | 128  \n```\n\n### LEFT  \nAll rows have no adjacent duplicates or empty spaces to shift into. No merges occur.  \n\n### RIGHT  \nAll rows have no adjacent duplicates or empty spaces to shift into. No merges occur.  \n\n### UP  \nAll columns have no adjacent duplicates or empty spaces to shift into. No merges occur.  \n\n### DOWN  \nWe check columns for merges when tiles shift downward:  \n- **Column 3 (values: 2, 128, 8, 128)**: When moving down, the 128 in Row 1 shifts past 8 (Row 2) to Row 2, becoming adjacent to the 128 in Row 3. These two 128s merge into 256, resulting in a score of 256.  \n\nNo other columns or directions yield valid merges. Thus, moving DOWN is the optimal choice.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to identify merges and strategic benefits. The goal is to maximize score through merges while keeping larger tiles organized.\n\n### LEFT Move:\n- **Row 0 (4|8|32|2)**: All distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 1 (128|64|16|128)**: All distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 2 (16|4|256|8)**: All distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 3 (32|2|16|128)**: All distinct; no merges.  \n**Result**: No merges.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- **Row 0 (4|8|32|2)**: All distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 1 (128|64|16|128)**: All distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 2 (16|4|256|8)**: All distinct; no merges.\n- **Row 3 (32|2|16|128)**: All distinct; no merges.  \n**Result**: No merges.\n\n### UP Move:\n- **Column 0 (4, 128, 16, 32)**: All distinct; no merges.\n- **Column 1 (8, 64, 4, 2)**: All distinct; no merges.\n- **Column 2 (32, 16, 256, 16)**: All distinct; no merges.\n- **Column 3 (2, 128, 8, 128)**: 128s are not adjacent after shifting up; no merges.  \n**Result**: No merges.\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- **Column 0 (4, 128, 16, 32)**: All distinct; no merges.\n- **Column 1 (8, 64, 4, 2)**: All distinct; no merges.\n- **Column 2 (32, 16, 256, 16)**: All distinct; no merges.\n- **Column 3 (2, 128, 8, 128)**: When shifting down, the 128 in row 1 and 128 in row 3 become adjacent after shifting (row 2 and row 3). These merge into 256, adding 256 to the score.  \n\n**Key Insight**: Only the DOWN move enables a merge (128 + 128 = 256), providing a significant score boost. Other directions yield no merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) to see if any valid merges or tile movements occur.

All tiles in every row are distinct (no adjacent duplicates). Tiles cannot shift right (grid is full), so no merges or movement occur.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Each column is processed upward.

All tiles in every column are distinct (no adjacent duplicates). Tiles cannot shift down (grid is full), so no merges or movement occur.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully populated with no adjacent tiles of the same number. No valid moves (merges or shifts) are possible in any direction.

Thus, there are no valid moves.

The goal is to identify moves that enable tile merges (to gain score) and strategically position larger tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current grid has no empty tiles (all 16 tiles are occupied), so valid moves require adjacent tiles to merge. We check each direction for potential merges:\n\n#### LEFT\/RIGHT Moves:\n- **Rows 0, 2, 3**: All tiles are distinct and already aligned to the edges (left for LEFT, right for RIGHT). No merges or shifts occur.\n- **Row 1**: Tiles are `128|64|16|128`. The 128s are at the start and end but not adjacent. Shifting left\/right does not align them for merging.\n\n#### UP Moves:\n- **Columns 0, 1, 3**: All tiles are distinct and aligned to the top. No merges or shifts occur.\n- **Column 2**: Tiles are `32|16|256|16`. The 16s are separated by 256 and not adjacent. Shifting up does not align them for merging.\n\n#### DOWN Moves:\n- **Columns 0, 1, 3**: All tiles are distinct and aligned to the bottom. No merges or shifts occur.\n- **Column 2**: Tiles are `32|16|256|16`. When shifting down:\n  - The 256 (row 2) moves down to row 3, pushing the 16 (row 3) up to row 2.\n  - The 16 (row 1) moves down to row 2, now adjacent to the 16 (row 2, pushed up from row 3).\n  - These two 16s merge into 32, adding 32 to the score.\n  - The 32 (row 0) shifts down to row 1, filling the empty space.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly the **DOWN** move enables a merge (16 + 16 → 32 in column 2).

They merge into 32 (score +32).  \n- **Column 3** (tiles: 2, 128, 8, 128): The 128s in row 1 and row 3 are vertically adjacent after shifting down. They merge into 256 (score +256).  \n\nThese merges are critical for increasing the score and maintaining flexibility. No other direction offers merges, making DOWN the best choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate possible merges or shifts for each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

No shifts occur (no empty spaces), so no valid merges.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Similarly, tiles in all rows are distinct and cannot merge. No shifts occur, so no valid merges.  \n3. **UP**: Columns contain distinct values, and no adjacent tiles can merge. No shifts occur, so no valid merges.  \n4. **DOWN**: Columns also contain distinct values, with no adjacent tiles to merge. No shifts occur, so no valid merges.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSince all tiles are filled (no empty spaces) and no adjacent tiles have the same value, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions.

No merges occur.  \n- Result: No score gain.\n\n### RIGHT Move:\n- All rows have distinct non-zero tiles with no adjacent duplicates. No merges occur.  \n- Result: No score gain.\n\n### UP Move:\n- Columns are processed upward. Focusing on **Column 3** (values: 2, 128, 8, 128):  \n  - Tiles shift upward, resulting in [2, 128, 128, 8] (after shifting).  \n  - The two adjacent 128s merge into a 256, adding 256 to the score.  \n- Other columns have no merges.  \n- Result: Merges 128 + 128 → 256, score gain of 256.\n\n### DOWN Move:\n- Columns are processed downward.

Since there are no empty spaces, valid moves depend on merging adjacent tiles after shifting.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **LEFT**: All rows have distinct values with no adjacent duplicates.

Shifting up would not merge any tiles.  \n4. **DOWN**: All columns have distinct values with no adjacent duplicates. Shifting down would not merge any tiles.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the directions. Given the strategic goal of keeping larger tiles in a corner (e.g., 256 in row 2, column 2), a **DOWN** swipe is chosen to potentially align larger tiles toward the bottom for future merges.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the possible swipes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and their outcomes based on the current game board:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4 | 8 | 32 | 2  \nRow 1: 128 | 64 | 16 | 128  \nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 16 | 128  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT Swipe**:  \n   All tiles in each row are distinct (no adjacent duplicates).

No score is gained.  \n\n3. **UP Swipe**:  \n   For each column, tiles are distinct (no adjacent duplicates). No merges occur, and the board remains unchanged. No score is gained.  \n\n4. **DOWN Swipe**:  \n   Tiles shift downward, and we check for merges in columns:  \n   - **Column 2 (values: 32, 16, 256, 16)**: The two 16s (row1 and row3) are not adjacent initially, but when shifted down, the 16 in row1 moves past 256 (row2) to row3, merging with the 16 in row3. This creates a 32 in row3, yielding a score of 32.  \n   - **Column 3 (values: 2, 128, 8, 128)**: The two 128s (row1 and row3) are not adjacent initially, but when shifted down, the 128 in row1 moves past 8 (row2) to row3, merging with the 128 in row3. This creates a 256 in row3, yielding a score of 256.  \n\n   The DOWN swipe results in two merges (16+16=32 and 128+128=256) for a total score of 288, making it the best move.  \n\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 grid and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on merging opportunities and tile movement.

These moves are invalid.\n- **UP\/DOWN**: All columns are full, and no adjacent tiles in any column are equal. Shifting up or down will not merge any tiles or move tiles (no empty spaces to fill). These moves are also invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are invalid because there are no adjacent tiles to merge and no empty spaces to move tiles into.

When moving down, the 16 in row 1 shifts past 256 to row 3, merging with the 16 in row 3 to form 32. This generates a score of 32.  \n\n#### **Column 3 (values: 2, 128, 8, 128)**  \n- The two 128s (row 1 and row 3) are separated by 8.

When moving down, the 128 in row 1 (column 3) shifts down past the 8 in row 2 (column 3) and merges with the 128 in row 3 (column 3). This results in a merged 256 tile, adding 256 to the score.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only valid merge occurs when moving DOWN, combining the two 128s in column 3. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the best move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for potential merges in all directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

No merges occur. The board remains unchanged.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Similar to LEFT, all rows have distinct tiles with no adjacent duplicates. No merges occur. The board remains unchanged.  \n\n3. **UP**:  \n   All columns have distinct tiles with no adjacent duplicates. No merges occur. The board remains unchanged.  \n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Focus on **Column 3** (values: 2, 128, 8, 128 from top to bottom). When swiping down:  \n   - The two 128s in Row 1 and Row 3 are separated by 8 in Row 2.  \n   - Tiles shift downward, pushing 128 (Row 1) past 8 (Row 2) to Row 2, making it adjacent to 128 (Row 3).  \n   - These two 128s merge into a 256, scoring 256.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly the DOWN move results in a valid merge (128 + 128 → 256). All other moves have no merges.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 game board and evaluate the potential for merging tiles in each direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). The goal is to maximize score by merging tiles.\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4 | 8 | 32 | 2  \nRow 1: 128 | 64 | 16 | 128  \nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 16 | 128  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### LEFT:\n- Each row is processed leftward. All tiles in every row are distinct (no adjacent equal numbers). No merges occur.  \n- **Result**: No score gain.  \n\n#### RIGHT:\n- Each row is processed rightward. All tiles in every row remain distinct after shifting (no adjacent equal numbers). No merges occur.  \n- **Result**: No score gain.  \n\n#### DOWN:\n- Each column is processed downward. All tiles in every column remain distinct after shifting (no adjacent equal numbers). No merges occur.  \n- **Result**: No score gain.  \n\n#### UP:\n- Each column is processed upward. Focus on Column 3 (values: 2, 128, 8, 128). When moving up:  \n  - The 128 in Row 1 and the 128 in Row 3 shift upward. After shifting, they become adjacent (Row 1 and Row 2).  \n  - These two 128s merge into a 256, adding 256 to the score.  \n- Other columns have no merges, but Column 3 produces a critical merge.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UP move is the only direction that results in a merge (128 + 128 = 256), maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid and evaluate each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the game rules. The grid is fully occupied (no empty tiles, 0s), so valid moves require adjacent tiles with the same number (since empty spaces are absent). Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Game Board:\nRow 0: 4|8|32|2  \nRow 1: 128|64|16|128  \nRow 2: 16|4|256|8  \nRow 3: 32|2|16|128  \n\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n#### **LEFT Move**:\n- All rows are checked for adjacent equal tiles.  \n  - Row 0: 4, 8, 32, 2 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Row 1: 128, 64, 16, 128 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Row 2: 16, 4, 256, 8 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Row 3: 32, 2, 16, 128 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  No merges occur, and tiles do not shift (grid is full).  \n\n#### **RIGHT Move**:\n- All rows are checked for adjacent equal tiles (processed rightward).  \n  - Row 0: 4, 8, 32, 2 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Row 1: 128, 64, 16, 128 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Row 2: 16, 4, 256, 8 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Row 3: 32, 2, 16, 128 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  No merges occur, and tiles do not shift (grid is full).  \n\n#### **UP Move**:\n- All columns are checked for adjacent equal tiles (processed upward).  \n  - Column 0: 4, 128, 16, 32 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Column 1: 8, 64, 4, 2 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Column 2: 32, 16, 256, 16 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Column 3: 2, 128, 8, 128 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  No merges occur, and tiles do not shift (grid is full).  \n\n#### **DOWN Move**:\n- All columns are checked for adjacent equal tiles (processed downward).  \n  - Column 0: 4, 128, 16, 32 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Column 1: 8, 64, 4, 2 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Column 2: 32, 16, 256, 16 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  - Column 3: 2, 128, 8, 128 (no adjacent duplicates).  \n  No merges occur, and tiles do not shift (grid is full).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is fully occupied with no adjacent tiles of the same number, meaning no valid merges are possible. However, since the problem requires selecting one of the four directions, the choice defaults to **LEFT** (arbitrary among invalid options).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for potential merges or valid movements. The current board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 8 | 32 | 2\nRow 1: 128 | 64 | 16 | 128\nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 256 | 8\nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 16 | 128\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid State**: All tiles are occupied (no zeros), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n2. **Adjacent Tiles Check**: No horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles have the same value:\n   - Rows: All rows have distinct consecutive values (e.g., Row 1: 128, 64, 16, 128—no adjacent duplicates).\n   - Columns: All columns also have distinct consecutive values (e.g., Column 3: 2, 128, 8, 128—no adjacent duplicates).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **LEFT\/RIGHT**: No merges occur in any row because no adjacent tiles are the same, and all rows are full (no empty spaces to shift into).\n- **UP\/DOWN**: No merges occur in any column for the same reason—no adjacent tiles are the same, and all columns are full.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Based on strategic considerations (e.g., aligning larger tiles), **DOWN** is chosen as the most plausible option, even though no immediate merges occur.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current 4x4 game board and evaluate possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on tile merging potential and strategic positioning. The game board is:\n\n```\nRow 0: 4|8|32|2\nRow 1: 128|64|16|128\nRow 2: 16|4|256|8\nRow 3: 32|2|16|128\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **No Empty Tiles**: All 16 tiles are occupied (no 0s), so valid moves require merging adjacent tiles of the same value.\n- **No Adjacent Merges**: There are no adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically) with the same value. For example:\n  - The 128s in Row 1 (columns 0 and 3) are separated by 64 and 16.\n  - The 16s in Column 2 (rows 1 and 3) are separated by 256.\n  - The 128s in Column 3 (rows 1 and 3) are separated by 8.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT\/RIGHT Swipe**: Tiles shift horizontally, but since all rows are full with no adjacent duplicates, no merging occurs. The board remains unchanged.\n2. **UP\/DOWN Swipe**: Tiles shift vertically, but all columns are full with no adjacent duplicates, so no merging occurs. The board remains unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can merge, no move will result in a merge or tile shift. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the lack of valid merges, any direction is technically invalid, but we choose based on the need to provide an answer.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the best move, we analyze each possible direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) based on the current 4x4 grid, where all tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces).

No adjacent equal tiles exist in any row (e.g., Row 1 has 128s at columns 0 and 3, but they are not adjacent). No merges occur, and no tiles shift (grid is full). **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Each row is processed rightward. Similarly, no adjacent equal tiles exist in any row (e.g., Row 1’s 128s remain non-adjacent). No merges or shifts. **Invalid move**.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Each column is processed upward. No adjacent equal tiles exist in any column (e.g., Column 3 has 128s at rows 1 and 3, but they are not adjacent).

No merges or shifts. **Invalid move**.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll directions are invalid because there are no adjacent equal tiles to merge, and the grid is full (no empty spaces to shift tiles into).

Thus, there are no valid moves. However, the problem requires selecting one of the four directions. Given the constraints, any direction is technically invalid, but the answer must be one of the options.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the 4x4 grid for valid moves. A valid move requires either adjacent tiles of the same number (which can merge) or empty spaces (0s) to shift tiles into.

The goal is to maximize the score from merging tiles.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe grid is:\n```\nRow 0: 4 | 8 | 32 | 2  \nRow 1: 128 | 64 | 16 | 128  \nRow 2: 16 | 4 | 256 | 8  \nRow 3: 32 | 2 | 16 | 128  \n```\nAll tiles are non-zero (no empty spaces), and we need to check for adjacent tiles that can merge in any direction.\n\n### Direction Evaluation:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Each row is shifted left. All tiles in every row are distinct (e.g., Row 0: 4, 8, 32, 2; Row 1: 128, 64, 16, 128). No adjacent equal tiles to merge. Score: 0.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   Each row is shifted right. All tiles in every row remain distinct (e.g., Row 1: 128, 64, 16, 128; Row 3: 32, 2, 16, 128). No adjacent equal tiles to merge. Score: 0.\n\n3. **UP**:  \n   Each column is shifted up. All columns have distinct tiles (e.g., Column 3: 2, 128, 8, 128; Column 2: 32, 16, 256, 16). No adjacent equal tiles to merge. Score: 0.\n\n4. **DOWN**:  \n   Each column is shifted down. All columns have distinct tiles (e.g., Column 1: 8, 64, 4, 2; Column 3: 2, 128, 8, 128). No adjacent equal tiles to merge. Score: 0.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is full with no adjacent equal tiles, so no valid merges are possible in any direction.

Your goal is to combine the tiles to have more scores. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, or when you achieve the 2048 tile.In the game board, 0 means empty tile and | means the delimiter between tiles. At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid. You can swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction. All tiles will shift to the edge of the grid, and any empty spaces will be filled by a new tile (2 or 4).When two tiles of the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the sum of those numbers and you will get the score of the new tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to form a 4. After merging, the new tile will not combine again in the same move. You lose the game if the grid is full, and no valid moves are left. A valid move is when two adjacent tiles are the same or there is an empty space to move a tile into. Keep in mind that combining tiles strategically is key. Try to keep the larger tiles in a corner and work towards merging smaller tiles to get higher scores.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\nFor example,if the Game board is\n0|0|4|0\n0|2|0|8\n0|0|4|0\n0|0|0|2\nand the answer is DOWN\n\nthe next state of Game board will be\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|0\n0|0|0|8\n0|2|8|2\nand since the two '4' merge into '8',so you will get 8 score\nGame board:\n4|8|32|2\n128|64|16|128\n16|4|256|8\n32|2|16|128\n\nCurrent epoch: 101\nThe answer you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n","epoch":101,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
