This prevents the cat from moving horizontally toward the exit in one step, forcing it to move elsewhere and giving you more time to trap it effectively.\n\nAnswer: 5 6","A reasonable move here is to block one of the cat’s immediately accessible empty cells, preventing it from easily heading toward the top exits. For instance, placing a wall at (3,4) removes one of the cat’s northern escape routes and helps begin the process of corralling it.\n\nAnswer: 3 4","A reasonable move here is to block one of the cat’s immediate upward paths to the exit. Placing a wall at (2,4) will force the cat to choose a different route, giving you a chance on subsequent turns to continue blocking its escape.\n\nAnswer: 2 4","I will place a wall at (1, 5).

This prevents the cat from moving directly upward toward the exit at (0,6).\n\nAnswer: 1 7","A good move here is to block the cat’s immediate path to the top exit. Notably, the cat has an adjacent empty cell at (1, 8) which directly leads to the top boundary exit at (0, 8).

This forces the cat to choose a different path, giving me more opportunities to block its escape on subsequent turns.\n\nAnswer: 2 9","It is currently impossible to prevent the cat from reaching an exit on its next move, because it is already adjacent to multiple exit cells and walls cannot be placed on exits.
