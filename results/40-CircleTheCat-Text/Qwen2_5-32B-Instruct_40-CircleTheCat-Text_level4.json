The cat is located at (4, 5) on the grid. It can move to adjacent empty cells (\"0\"), which in this case would be (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), and (5, 6).\n\nNext, we need to consider the paths the cat could take to reach the exits and block those paths effectively. One efficient way to do this is to place a wall in a strategic position that cuts off multiple potential exit routes.\n\nLooking at the board, placing a wall at (5, 5) would cut off several potential paths the cat could take towards the exits. This position blocks the direct path to the lower exits and also restricts the cat's movement upwards, making it harder for the cat to maneuver around the walls.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to place a wall at (5, 5).\n\nAnswer: 5 5","Given the game board and the rules, the optimal strategy would be to block the cat's immediate path to an exit while also considering potential future moves.

Placing a wall at (6, 4) will effectively block the cat's movement towards the right and potentially trap it between walls and the exit.\n\nTherefore, my move is to place a wall at (6, 4).\n\nAnswer: 6 4","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the board and determine a strategic position to place a wall (\"1\") to prevent the cat (\"C\") from reaching any exit (\"E\").

We should focus on blocking the immediate paths the cat could take towards the exits. Looking at the surrounding cells, we see that placing a wall directly adjacent to the cat can limit its movement options effectively.\n\nConsidering the possible movements of the cat from its current position, placing a wall at (5, 4) will cut off one of the main paths the cat could use to move towards the exits.

Identify the cat's current position and its immediate neighbors.\n2. Check which neighbors are open paths towards the exits.\n3. Block one of these paths to limit the cat's movement.\n\nLooking at the cat's position (6,5), we see the following neighbors:\n- (5,4) - Wall\n- (5,5) - Open path towards the top exit\n- (5,6) - Wall\n- (6,4) - Open path towards the left exit\n- (6,6) - Open path towards the right exit\n- (7,4) - Open path towards the bottom exit\n- (7,5) - Wall\n- (7,6) - Wall\n\nFrom this analysis, blocking the path at (6,6) would effectively cut off one of the main routes the cat could use to reach the exit.

From there, we can strategically place a wall (\"1\") to block the cat's path to any exit.\n\nCurrent cat position: (4, 5)\n\nPotential moves for the cat from its current position:\n- Up-left: (3, 5) - Wall (1)\n- Up-right: (3, 6) - Empty (0)\n- Left: (4, 4) - Wall (1)\n- Right: (4, 6) - Wall (1)\n- Down-left: (5, 4) - Empty (0)\n- Down-right: (5, 6) - Wall (1)\n\nBased on these moves, the cat could move to either (3, 6) or (5, 4) on its next turn. To effectively trap the cat, we need to block both these paths. Given that we can only place one wall per turn, the best move would be to place a wall at (3, 6), as it blocks the cat's most immediate path towards the top right exit.\n\nThus, the strategic placement of a wall at (3, 6) will prevent the cat from moving towards the exit on its next turn.\n\nAnswer: 3 6","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the current positions and movements to determine the best move for placing a wall (\"1\") to prevent the cat from reaching any exit (\"E\").\n\nGiven the current state of the board, the cat is located at (4, 5). We need to block off all potential paths that the cat could take towards any exit.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Identify the immediate surroundings of the cat:\n   - At (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)\n   - At (4, 4), (4, 6)\n   - At (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)\n\n2. Determine which of these positions can be used to effectively block the cat:\n   - Placing a wall at (4, 4) would block the cat from moving left or down-left.\n   - Placing a wall at (4, 6) would block the cat from moving right or down-right.\n   - Placing a wall at (5, 5) would block the cat from moving down.\n\nAmong these, placing a wall at (5, 5) seems to be the most strategic because it blocks the direct downward path, which otherwise allows the cat to potentially move closer to the bottom exits.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to place a wall at (5, 5).\n\nAnswer: 5 5","Given the board layout and the rules, the best strategy to trap the cat would be to block all potential paths to the exits. The cat is currently at position (3, 4) and has several paths towards the exits. To effectively block the cat's path, placing a wall in a strategic location is necessary.\n\nConsidering the cat's possible movements and the exits, placing a wall at (5, 5) would significantly reduce the cat's mobility without immediately forcing it into a corner that could lead to an exit. This placement blocks the central path that the cat could use to navigate towards the lower exits.\n\nAnswer: 5 5","To solve this problem, we need to determine the best move to place a wall (\"1\") that will prevent the cat (\"C\") from reaching any of the exits (\"E\"). The cat's current position is at (3, 4). To trap the cat effectively, we must block off all potential paths the cat could take towards an exit.\n\nLooking at the hexagonal grid, the cat is surrounded by walls and open spaces. The most strategic move would be to place a wall directly adjacent to the cat in such a way that it blocks the cat's movement towards the exits. By analyzing the positions around the cat:\n\n- Moving the cat to (2, 4) or (2, 5) would lead closer to the exits.\n- Moving the cat to (4, 4) or (4, 5) would also lead closer to the exits.\n- Moving the cat to (3, 3) or (3, 5) would be blocked by existing walls.\n\nThus, placing a wall at (2, 4) would effectively block the cat's path upwards, preventing it from moving towards the exits.\n\nAnswer: 2 4","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the current position of the cat (\"C\") and the possible paths it could take to reach any of the exits (\"E\"). Our goal is to strategically place a wall (\"1\") in such a way that it blocks the cat's path to the exit while ensuring that the cat remains trapped and unable to move to another exit.\n\nFrom the given board, the cat is located at (3, 4). Let's consider the possible moves for the cat and how we can block them:\n\n- If the cat moves to the left (to (3, 3)), it will hit a wall.\n- If the cat moves to the right (to (3, 5)), it will also hit a wall.\n- If the cat moves down-left (to (4, 3)), it will hit a wall.\n- If the cat moves down-right (to (4, 5)), it will hit a wall.\n- If the cat moves up-left (to (2, 4)), it will move into an open area.\n- If the cat moves up-right (to (2, 5)), it will move into an open area.\n\nThe cat can potentially escape by moving up-left or up-right. To prevent this, we need to place a wall in one of these positions to block the cat's movement towards the exit. The best option would be to block the path that leads closer to the exit.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, placing a wall at (2, 4) would effectively block the cat's path and reduce its options to move towards the exit.\n\nTherefore, my move is to place a wall at (2, 4).\n\nAnswer: 2 4","To solve this problem, we need to determine a strategic placement of a wall (\"1\") that will prevent the cat (\"C\") from reaching any of the exits (\"E\").

Placing a wall at (2,5) would block the up-right path. However, this still leaves the right and down paths open. A better strategy would be to block the down path at (4,4), which will limit the cat's movement significantly.\n\nSo, placing a wall at (4,4) would be a strong move to trap the cat. \n\nAnswer: 4 4","To analyze the given hexagonal board and determine the best move, we need to consider the cat's potential paths towards the exits and block them effectively.

We should aim to block this path.\n\nGiven the positions available for the cat to move, placing a wall at (1, 4) would prevent the cat from moving directly towards the exit in the next move. This move will also force the cat into a more confined area, making it harder for the cat to escape.\n\nThus, the optimal move is to place a wall at (1, 4).\n\nAnswer: 1 4","To determine the best move, we need to analyze the board and identify key positions that could prevent the cat from reaching any exits. The cat's current position is at (2, 4), and it needs to be blocked from moving towards any exits.\n\nFirstly, let's examine the potential paths the cat could take:\n- Directly upwards: It would hit a wall or another block quickly.\n- Downwards: There are several paths down, but they all eventually lead to areas where we can strategically place walls.\n\nGiven the cat's current position and the existing walls, placing a wall directly beneath the cat at (3, 4) would significantly limit its movement options. This will force the cat to move left or right, both of which are less favorable due to the existing walls.\n\nThus, placing a wall at (3, 4) seems like a strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: 3 4","To solve this problem, we need to strategically place a wall (\"1\") to prevent the cat (\"C\") from reaching any exit (\"E\").

Placing a wall in either of these positions would effectively block the cat's path towards the top exit. However, since we need to ensure that the cat cannot escape through any exit, blocking the path directly above the cat is crucial.\n\nTherefore, placing a wall at (1, 4) will block the cat from moving upwards, which is a direct path to an exit.\n\nAnswer: 1 4","Given the board configuration, we need to determine a strategic position to place a wall (\"1\") that will hinder the cat's path towards the exits without immediately blocking all its movement options.

Given the hexagonal nature of the board, each cell can have up to six neighbors. However, since the cat's movement is restricted to adjacent empty cells (\"0\"), we need to block off all such paths.\n\nLooking at the board, the cat is located at (7, 4). The immediate adjacent cells to the cat are (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 3), (7, 5), (8, 3), and (8, 4). Among these, (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 3), and (7, 5) are either walls or out of bounds. Therefore, the cat can potentially move to (8, 3) or (8, 4).\n\nSince our goal is to block the cat's path to any exit, we should place a wall in a position that prevents the cat from moving towards an exit. Placing a wall at (8, 4) would block the cat's path to the lower part of the board, which includes potential exits.\n\nThus, my move will be to place a wall at (8, 4).\n\nAnswer: 8 4","To determine the best move, we need to consider the cat's potential movements and block the most critical paths leading to the exits. Currently, the cat (\"C\") is located at (7, 3) on the board.

However, the cat still has other options to move around. To better secure a win, we should focus on blocking the cat's access to multiple potential exits. \n\nBy placing a wall at (8, 4), we effectively cut off one of the cat's potential escape routes towards the bottom right corner. This move also forces the cat into a more confined area, reducing its mobility and making it harder for it to find an open path to any exit.\n\nTherefore, the strategic move is to place a wall at (8, 4).\n\nAnswer: 8 4","To solve this problem, we need to determine a strategic position to place a wall (\"1\") to prevent the cat (\"C\") from reaching any of the exits (\"E\").

One effective strategy is to place a wall in a position that limits the cat's movement towards the exits. Considering the cat's current position and the surrounding cells, placing a wall at (6, 4) would be a strong move because it blocks the cat's path upwards and towards the right.\n\nTherefore, my move will be to place a wall at (6, 4).\n\nAnswer: 6 4","To analyze the board and determine the best move, we need to consider the possible paths the cat can take to reach an exit and block them effectively.

This placement would limit the cat's movement significantly, especially since the cat has fewer options due to the walls and the edge of the board.\n\nTherefore, my move would be to place a wall at (4, 6).\n\nAnswer: 4 6","To determine the best move to prevent the cat from reaching an exit, we need to analyze the possible paths the cat could take from its current position to the exits and block the most critical path.\n\nThe cat's current position is (5, 6) in the grid.

We should prioritize blocking the path that leads closest to an exit.\n\nAnalyzing the surrounding area, the most direct paths towards the exits are through the cells (4, 6) and (6, 6). However, placing a wall directly in front of these cells might not fully secure the win, as the cat can still potentially move around. A better strategy would be to block a cell that prevents the cat from having multiple escape routes.\n\nLooking at the grid, placing a wall at (4, 5) will effectively block the cat from moving upwards towards the exit. This move also limits the cat's movement options, making it harder for the cat to find a way out.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to place a wall at (4, 5).\n\nAnswer: 4 5","To solve this problem, we need to strategically place a wall (\"1\") such that the cat (\"C\") cannot move towards an exit (\"E\").

Placing a wall at (4, 6) would prevent the cat from moving left, and placing a wall at (4, 8) would prevent the cat from moving right. However, placing a wall at (4, 6) might still leave the cat with options to move up or down, whereas placing a wall at (4, 8) would block two paths (right and potentially up).\n\nTherefore, placing a wall at (4, 8) seems like a good strategy to reduce the cat's movement options significantly.\n\nAnswer: 4 8","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the current position of the cat (\"C\") and the potential paths it can take to reach an exit (\"E\").

For an odd row (like row 5), the adjacent cells are (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 7), (6, 5), and (6, 6).\n\nTo effectively block the cat's movement, let's focus on blocking the immediate paths that lead to exits. Placing a wall at (5, 5) would cut off direct paths both upwards and downwards, making it harder for the cat to move towards the exits.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to place a wall at (5, 5).\n\nAnswer: 5 5","To determine the best move, we need to analyze the current positions and potential movements of the cat (\"C\") and consider the placement of walls (\"1\") to prevent the cat from reaching any exit (\"E\").\n\nFirst, let's identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat is currently at position (5, 6). From there, the cat can move to:\n- (4, 6)\n- (4, 7)\n- (5, 5)\n- (5, 7)\n- (6, 5)\n- (6, 7)\n\nWe need to block these paths effectively. Let's consider the immediate threats:\n\n1. The path to the top left exit (4, 6).\n2. The path to the top right exit (4, 7).\n3. The path directly down to (6, 5) which could lead to further exits.\n\nConsidering these, the most strategic move would be to block the direct path to the exit. Placing a wall at (4, 6) would cut off the immediate threat to the top left exit.\n\nTherefore, my move will be to place a wall at (4, 6).\n\nAnswer: 4 6","To solve this problem, we need to determine a strategic placement of a wall (\"1\") that prevents the cat (\"C\") from reaching any exit (\"E\"). Given the current board configuration, let's analyze the situation:\n\n1. The cat is located at position (5, 5).\n2. The cat's immediate options are to move to (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 5), or (6, 6).\n3. We need to block these paths strategically.\n\nGiven the current positions and the cat's proximity to potential exits, blocking the path directly above or below the cat would be effective since the cat is surrounded by walls on the sides and has limited movement options.\n\nLet's consider placing a wall at (4, 5) which is directly above the cat. This move will block one of the cat's primary escape routes towards the top of the board.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to place a wall at (4, 5).\n\nAnswer: 4 5","To determine the best move, we need to analyze the current positions and potential paths the cat can take to reach the exits. The cat is located at (5, 5) in the grid, and there are multiple exits along the edges of the board. We need to block off the most critical path(s) that the cat could use to escape.\n\nAnalyzing the board, the cat can move to the following adjacent cells: (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 5), and (6, 6). Among these, (4, 5) and (4, 6) are particularly important because they lead closer to the top exits.\n\nPlacing a wall at (4, 5) would cut off one of the primary routes the cat could use to head towards the top exits. This would significantly limit the cat's movement options and force it to consider other less direct routes, which could be blocked later.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to place a wall at (4, 5).\n\nAnswer: 4 5","To solve this task, we need to analyze the current position of the cat and the possible paths to the exits. Our goal is to strategically place a wall (\"1\") in such a way that the cat cannot reach any of the exits.\n\nFrom the given board, the cat's current position is at (5, 6). We need to block off all potential escape routes from this position.\n\nLooking at the board, we see that the cat can potentially move towards the bottom left and bottom right directions. However, there are already some walls placed which limit these movements. To ensure the cat is trapped, we should focus on blocking the immediate path the cat could use to approach the exits.\n\nOne strategic move would be to place a wall directly in front of the cat's possible movement towards the bottom left. This means placing a wall at (6, 5), which will block the cat's direct path downwards and towards the left.\n\nTherefore, my move is to place a wall at coordinates (6, 5).\n\nAnswer: 6 5","To solve this task, we need to analyze the current position of the cat (\"C\") and the exits (\"E\"). The goal is to place a wall (\"1\") in such a way that the cat cannot reach any exit on its next move. \n\nFrom the given board, the cat's current position is at (4, 4). Looking at the potential moves for the cat, we see that it can move to positions (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4), and (5, 5).\n\nAmong these positions, we need to identify the ones that are critical to blocking the cat's path to an exit. We should focus on the positions that are directly leading to an exit or are part of the only path to an exit.\n\nConsidering the board, placing a wall at (3, 5) would block one of the main paths the cat could use to get closer to an exit without immediately reaching one. This move forces the cat into a more confined area, limiting its movement options.\n\nTherefore, my move will be to place a wall at (3, 5).\n\nAnswer: 3 5","To determine the best move, we need to analyze the current position of the cat and the potential paths it could take towards the exits. Given the hexagonal nature of the board, each cell has up to six neighbors, depending on whether the row index is even or odd.\n\nThe cat is currently at position (4, 3) ('C'). We need to block the cat's path to any exit ('E') while ensuring that we do not inadvertently create a path for the cat to escape.\n\nLooking at the board, we can see that the cat is surrounded by several empty spaces and walls. To effectively block the cat, we need to consider the immediate surrounding cells and strategically place a wall.\n\nConsidering the cat's position, blocking the cell directly above it (3, 3) would cut off one of the main paths the cat might take to reach the exit. This move would prevent the cat from moving upwards towards the exit on the top row.\n\nThus, the optimal move would be to place a wall at (3, 3).\n\nAnswer: 3 3","To solve this problem, we need to strategically place a wall to prevent the cat from reaching any exit while ensuring the cat doesn't have a path to an exit after our move. The cat's current position is at (5, 2) in the given grid. We need to consider the cat's possible movements and block the paths leading to the exits.\n\nLooking at the board, the cat is surrounded by several empty spaces and one wall. The potential paths for the cat include moving towards the left, right, or diagonally down-left and down-right. To effectively trap the cat, we should block the most critical path that leads to an exit.\n\nOne effective strategy is to place a wall directly in the path that the cat might use to approach an exit. In this case, placing a wall at (4, 2) would cut off the cat's direct path to the exits above and to the sides.\n\nThus, my move is to place a wall at (4, 2).\n\nAnswer: 4 2","To determine the best move to trap the cat, we need to analyze the current positions and potential movements. The cat (\"C\") is located at position (5, 2) and the exits (\"E\") are along the edges of the board. Our objective is to block off all possible paths the cat could use to reach any exit without itself being able to move.\n\nLet's consider the immediate surroundings of the cat:\n- To the left (4, 2): Wall (\"1\")\n- Above-left (4, 3): Empty (\"0\")\n- Above-right (4, 1): Empty (\"0\")\n- Right (6, 2): Wall (\"1\")\n- Below-left (6, 1): Empty (\"0\")\n- Below-right (6, 3): Empty (\"0\")\n\nGiven these options, placing a wall at (4, 3) would effectively cut off two of the cat's escape routes. This move blocks the path directly above the cat and also makes it harder for the cat to maneuver around the existing walls. \n\nTherefore, my move is to place a wall at (4, 3).\n\nAnswer: 4 3","To solve this problem, we need to strategically place a wall (\"1\") to block the cat's path to any exit. Given the cat's position and the layout of the board, let's analyze the best move.\n\nThe cat is located at (4, 2). We need to block all potential paths to the exits. Looking at the neighboring cells and the overall board structure, placing a wall directly above the cat at (3, 2) will effectively prevent the cat from moving towards the top exits. This move also prevents the cat from having easy access to other potential escape routes through the center of the board.\n\nTherefore, the strategic move is to place a wall at (3, 2).\n\nAnswer: 3 2","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the current position of the cat (\"C\") and the potential paths it could take to reach an exit (\"E\"). Our goal is to block these paths by strategically placing a wall (\"1\").\n\nGiven the current board:\n\n```\nEE1E1EE1EE1\nE000001000E\nE010000100E\nE0C11101001\nE101011011E\nE0001000001\nE010011000E\n1000010000E\nE010000001E\n1010000000E\nEEEEEEEEE1E\n```\n\nThe cat is located at (4, 2). From here, it can move to the left (3, 2) or right (5, 2), but both directions are blocked by walls. It can also move down (5, 2), which is also blocked by a wall. Therefore, the only viable moves for the cat are diagonally up-left (3, 1) and diagonally up-right (3, 3).\n\nWe need to block these two potential moves to prevent the cat from escaping. Placing a wall at (3, 1) would effectively block the path diagonally up-left, while placing a wall at (3, 3) would block the path diagonally up-right. Since we want to ensure the cat cannot move, blocking either path would be sufficient, but to be thorough, we will choose the one that potentially blocks more future moves.\n\nChoosing to place a wall at (3, 3) would block the path diagonally up-right, and it also prevents the cat from moving right to (5, 2) in the future, making it a strategic choice.\n\nTherefore, my move is to place a wall at (3, 3).\n\nAnswer: 3 3","To solve this problem, we need to consider the current position of the cat (\"C\") and potential paths to the exits (\"E\"). Our goal is to block these paths effectively to prevent the cat from reaching an exit.\n\nFrom the given board, the cat's position is at (4, 2). The cat can move to adjacent cells that are marked as \"0\". To prevent the cat from moving towards any exit, we need to strategically place a wall (\"1\") in such a way that it blocks all possible paths the cat could take.\n\nLooking at the immediate surroundings of the cat:\n- Moving up would lead to (3, 2) which is a wall.\n- Moving up-right would lead to (3, 3) which is also a wall.\n- Moving right would lead to (4, 3) which is a wall.\n- Moving down-right would lead to (5, 3) which is empty.\n- Moving down would lead to (5, 2) which is empty.\n- Moving down-left would lead to (5, 1) which is empty.\n\nSince the cat can move down, down-right, or down-left, we need to block one of these paths. The best strategy here is to place a wall in a position that prevents the cat from having multiple escape routes. Placing a wall at (5, 2) would block two of the three paths (down and down-left), leaving only one path open (down-right).\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to place a wall at (5, 2).\n\nAnswer: 5 2","To solve this problem, we need to strategically place a wall (\"1\") in such a way that the cat (\"C\") cannot reach any exit (\"E\"). Given the current board configuration, let's analyze the possible moves for the cat and the most effective placement for our wall.\n\nCurrently, the cat is located at position (4, 2) (0-indexed). It has several paths towards exits, but the most immediate concern is blocking the cat's direct path to the closest exits. Looking at the neighboring cells of the cat, it can move to positions (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2), or (5, 3). Among these, the most critical positions to block are those that would immediately prevent the cat from moving closer to an exit.\n\nBy examining the board, placing a wall at (3, 2) would effectively block one of the cat's immediate escape routes. This move prevents the cat from moving upwards directly and forces it into a more confined space.\n\nTherefore, my move will be to place a wall at position (3, 2).\n\nAnswer: 3 2"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
