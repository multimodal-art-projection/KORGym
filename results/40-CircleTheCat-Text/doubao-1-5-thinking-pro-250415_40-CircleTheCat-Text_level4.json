The cat (\"C\") is located at coordinates (5, 5) (row 5, column 5). For a cell in an odd row (row 5 is odd), the adjacent cells are: (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4), and (6, 5). Among these, (5, 4) and (6, 5) are walls (\"1\"), so the cat can only move to the remaining four empty cells (\"0\"): (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), and (6, 4).\n\nNext, we analyze the cat's potential paths to exits (\"E\"). The exits are on the boundary of the grid. The most immediate threats are the exits along the right edge (column 10) and top edge (row 0), as these are the closest to the cat. \n\nThe path to the right exit (e.g., (5, 10)) is straightforward: (5, 5) → (5, 6) → (5, 7) → (5, 8) → (5, 9) → (5, 10). This path is clear of walls and requires 5 moves. Blocking (5, 6) directly cuts off this critical rightward path, forcing the cat to take longer or more obstructed routes.\n\nOther paths (e.g., upward to row 0, downward to row 10, or leftward to column 0) are also possible but are either longer or have more obstacles. Blocking (5, 6) is the most effective first move to delay the cat's access to the nearest exit.\n\nAnswer: 5 6","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the cat's position (4,4) and its adjacent cells, focusing on blocking the shortest paths to exits. The cat can move to five adjacent empty cells: (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), and (5,5). The most immediate threats are the shortest paths to exits on the top boundary (row 0), which can be reached in 4 moves. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Path to (0,5) E**: The cat can move (4,4) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (0,5) E. This is a critical 4-step path.\n- **Path to (0,4) E**: The cat can move (4,4) → (3,4) → (2,4) → (1,4) → (0,4) E. This is another 4-step path.\n\nBlocking (3,5) directly disrupts the shortest path to (0,5) E, reducing the cat's immediate escape routes. This forces the cat to rely on longer paths, giving more time to block subsequent moves.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (3,5) blocks the most immediate escape path to the top boundary exit (0,5) E.\n\nAnswer: 3 5","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (3, 4). For a cell in an odd row (r=3), the adjacent cells are: (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5) (wall), (4, 3), and (4, 4). The cat can move to the empty cells (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3), and (4, 4).\n\nNext, we analyze the shortest paths from these adjacent cells to any exit (\"E\"). The closest exits are in row 0 (columns 3-6 and 8-10) and column 0\/10 of other rows. The most immediate threats are the 3-step paths:\n- (3, 4) → (2, 3) → (1, 3) → (0, 3) (E)\n- (3, 4) → (2, 4) → (1, 4) → (0, 4) (E)\n\nThese paths are the shortest and most critical for the cat to escape. Blocking either (2, 3) or (2, 4) disrupts one of these paths. Between the two, (2, 4) is part of a direct upward path to row 0, making it a high-priority target. Placing a wall at (2, 4) blocks this critical escape route, forcing the cat to rely on longer, more easily blockable paths.\n\nAnswer: 2 4","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible paths to exits. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (2, 3). Since row 2 is even, the cat's adjacent cells are:  \n- (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2) [wall], (2, 4) [wall], (3, 3), (3, 4).  \n\nThe cat can move to (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 3), or (3, 4), as these are empty (\"0\"). The most immediate threats are paths to top-row exits (\"E\") in row 0, which are only two moves away:  \n\n1. **Path 1**: (2, 3) → (1, 3) → (0, 2) (E)  \n2. **Path 2**: (2, 3) → (1, 4) → (0, 3) (E)  \n\nBlocking either (1, 3) or (1, 4) disrupts these critical short paths. Between these, (1, 3) is part of an additional path to (0, 1) (E) via (1, 2), making it a more critical chokepoint. Placing a wall at (1, 3) eliminates multiple immediate escape routes to the top exits.  \n\nAnswer: 1 3","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat is at (1, 4) (row 1, column 4). For a cell in an odd row (r=1), the adjacent cells are: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4). Among these, only (1, 5) and (2, 3) are empty cells (\"0\"), so the cat can move to either of these on its turn.\n\n### Key Analysis of Paths:\n- **Path via (1, 5)**: From (1, 5), the cat can move to (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 7), etc., eventually leading toward exits like (1, 10) or (2, 10).\n- **Path via (2, 3)**: From (2, 3), the cat can move to (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1), etc., leading toward exits like (2, 0) or (3, 0).\n\n### Strategy:\nThe goal is to block the cat’s most critical path. The path via (2, 3) is shorter and more direct to nearby exits (e.g., (2, 0)). By blocking (2, 3), we limit the cat’s initial options to only (1, 5), forcing it into a longer, more easily blockable path.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (2, 3) prevents the cat from moving into this critical cell, reducing its options and slowing its progress toward exits.\n\nAnswer: 2 3"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Our goal is to block one of these to disrupt the cat’s path to any exit (\"E\").  \n\n### Analysis of Escape Paths:  \n1. **Path via (4,5)**: The cat could move to (4,5), then to (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), and finally to (0,5) (an exit on the top boundary).  \n2. **Path via (5,6)**: The cat could move to (5,6), then to (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), and finally to (5,10) (an exit on the right boundary).  \n3. **Path via (6,4)**: The cat could move to (6,4), then to (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,4), (2,3), (1,3), and finally to (0,3) (an exit on the top boundary).  \n\n### Strategy:  \nBlocking any of the cat’s immediate adjacent cells will disrupt one of these paths. The most critical immediate threat is the path via (4,5), as it leads directly to the top boundary exit (0,5) in the fewest steps. Blocking (4,5) cuts off this direct route and forces the cat to rely on longer, more easily disruptible paths.  \n\nAnswer: 4 5","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we analyze the cat's possible paths to exits and identify critical chokepoints. The cat is at position (6, 4) and can move to three adjacent empty cells: (5, 5), (6, 3), and (7, 5). We need to block a cell that disrupts the most immediate or critical escape routes.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat's Possible Moves**:\n   - **(5, 5)**: Leads to paths through (5, 6), (4, 6), etc., but these are longer.\n   - **(6, 3)**: Leads to a very short path: (6, 3) → (6, 2) → (6, 1) → (6, 0) (exit). This is the shortest path (3 steps to exit).\n   - **(7, 5)**: Leads to paths through (8, 5), (9, 5) → (10, 5) (exit), but this is also 3 steps.\n\n2. **Critical Chokepoint**:\n   The shortest and most immediate threat is the path from (6, 3) → (6, 2) → (6, 1) → (6, 0). Blocking (6, 1) directly cuts off this critical path, as (6, 1) is the penultimate cell before the exit (6, 0). Without (6, 1), the cat cannot reach (6, 0) via this route.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (6, 1) blocks the shortest and most immediate escape path for the cat.\n\nAnswer: 6 1","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its adjacent cells. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (7, 5) (row 7, column 5). For a cell in an odd row (row 7 is odd), the adjacent cells are:  \n- (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 6), (8, 4), (8, 5).  \n\nAmong these, the valid empty cells (\"0\") the cat can move to are: (6, 4), (7, 6), (8, 4), and (8, 5) (since (6, 5) and (7, 4) are walls (\"1\")).  \n\n### Key Observations:  \nThe cat aims to reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary. The most immediate threats are paths leading to exits in row 10 (the bottom boundary), as the cat is in row 7 and can reach row 10 in 3 steps. Critical paths include:  \n1. (7, 5) → (8, 4) → (9, 4) → (10, 3) (exit).  \n2. (7, 5) → (8, 5) → (9, 5) → (10, 5) (exit).  \n\n### Strategy:  \nBlocking (8, 5) directly cuts off one of the cat’s most immediate escape routes. If (8, 5) is blocked, the cat can no longer use this cell to move toward row 10. This reduces the cat’s options and forces it to rely on longer paths, which are easier to block in subsequent moves.  \n\nAnswer: 8 5","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (8, 4) in the 11×11 hexagonal grid. \n\n### Cat's Position and Adjacent Cells\nFor a cell at (r, c) in an even row (r=8 is even), the adjacent cells are:  \n- (r-1, c) = (7, 4) (wall, \"1\")  \n- (r-1, c+1) = (7, 5) (empty, \"0\")  \n- (r, c-1) = (8, 3) (empty, \"0\")  \n- (r, c+1) = (8, 5) (wall, \"1\")  \n- (r+1, c) = (9, 4) (empty, \"0\")  \n- (r+1, c+1) = (9, 5) (empty, \"0\")  \n\nThus, the cat can move to **(7, 5)**, **(8, 3)**, **(9, 4)**, or **(9, 5)**.\n\n### Critical Paths to Exits\nExits (\"E\") are on the boundary (r=0, r=10, c=0, c=10). The most immediate threats are paths where the cat can reach an exit in 2 moves:  \n1. **(9, 4) → (10, 3)** (exit, row 10, column 3 is \"E\").  \n2. **(9, 5) → (10, 5)** (exit, row 10, column 5 is \"E\").  \n\nThese paths are critical because the cat can reach an exit in one additional move after moving to (9, 4) or (9, 5).\n\n### Blocking the Most Immediate Threat\nTo prevent the cat from escaping, we must block one of these critical cells. Blocking (9, 4) directly cuts off the shortest path to the exit at (10, 3). While the cat could still move to (9, 5), blocking (9, 4) reduces the cat’s options and forces it to take longer paths, which can be addressed in subsequent moves. However, since we can only place one wall per turn, blocking (9, 4) is the most urgent to neutralize the immediate threat.\n\nAnswer: 9 4","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we analyze the cat's current position and its possible paths to exits. The cat is at (9,5) on an 11×11 hexagonal grid. The cat can move to adjacent empty cells (\"0\") on its turn, and our goal is to place a wall (\"1\") to block all paths to exits (\"E\").\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat's Position and Adjacent Cells**: The cat is at (9,5) (row 9, column 5). Since row 9 is odd, its adjacent cells are:\n   - (8,4) (empty, \"0\")\n   - (8,5) (wall, \"1\")\n   - (9,4) (wall, \"1\")\n   - (9,6) (empty, \"0\")\n   - (10,4) (wall, \"1\")\n   - (10,5) (exit, \"E\")  \n\n   Thus, the cat’s only possible moves are to (8,4) and (9,6).\n\n2. **Path Analysis**:\n   - **Path via (8,4)**: From (8,4), the cat can move to (7,5), (8,3), etc., eventually leading to exits in row 0 (e.g., (0,6) is an exit).\n   - **Path via (9,6)**: From (9,6), the cat can move to (8,6), (9,7), etc., with (9,7) adjacent to exits in row 10 (e.g., (10,7) is an exit).\n\n3. **Critical Cell**: The most immediate threat is the path via (9,6), as (9,6) leads to (9,7), which is adjacent to row 10 exits. Blocking (9,6) removes this critical path, forcing the cat to rely on the longer path via (8,4). However, even if the cat takes the (8,4) path, it still has a route to row 0 exits. Despite this, blocking (9,6) is the optimal move to delay and restrict the cat’s most direct escape.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBlocking (9,6) disrupts the cat’s most immediate path to row 10 exits, reducing its options and buying time to further restrict movement in subsequent turns.\n\nAnswer: 9 6"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

For even rows (r=2 is even), adjacent cells are:  \n   - (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4) (all \"0\" except (2, 4), which is a wall).  \n\n2. **Immediate Exit Paths**: The most critical exits are on the top boundary (row 0). The cat can reach these exits in 2 moves via:  \n   - (2, 3) → (1, 3) → (0, 2) E (exit in 2 moves).  \n   - (2, 3) → (1, 4) → (0, 3) E (exit in 2 moves).  \n\n3. **Blocking Strategy**: The cat’s immediate threats are the cells (1, 3) and (1, 4), as they directly connect to top exits. Blocking one of these cells disrupts the shortest escape routes. Between these, (1, 3) is prioritized as it is a direct path to an exit and reduces the cat’s options.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (1, 3) blocks the cat’s most immediate escape route to (0, 2) E, forcing the cat to rely on longer paths, which can be addressed in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: 1 3","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the cat's current position and possible paths to exits.

The most immediate threats are paths leading toward column 10 (right boundary) or row 10 (bottom boundary).  \n\n3. **Blocking Strategy**: The cat’s move to (1, 5) (right) leads toward column 10, which has exits in row 1 (column 10) and row 0 (columns 9-10). Blocking (1, 5) limits the cat’s movement to (2, 3) (down), which is less immediately threatening as it leads toward row 10 but with more walls and longer paths.\n\n### Decision:\nPlacing a wall at (1, 5) blocks the cat’s primary path toward column 10, forcing it to move down to (2, 3), which is a less critical direction.\n\nAnswer: 1 5"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The cat is at (4,4) on an 11×11 hexagonal grid. The cat’s adjacent cells (even row) are (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5) (wall), (5,4), and (5,5). The cat can move to the 0-cells: (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (5,4), and (5,5). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat’s Escape Paths**: The cat can reach exits (E) via multiple paths from these adjacent cells. For example:\n   - (3,4) → (2,3) → (2,2) → (2,1) → (2,0) (E).\n   - (3,5) → (2,5) → (2,6) → ... → (2,10) (E).\n   - (4,3) → (3,3) → (2,2) → (2,1) → (2,0) (E).\n   - (5,4) → (6,3) → (7,3) → (7,2) → (7,1) → (7,0) (E).\n   - (5,5) → (5,6) → (4,6) → (3,6) → (2,6) → ... → (2,10) (E).\n\n2. **Critical Chokepoint**: The cell (4,3) is a key node in the cat’s leftward escape paths. Blocking (4,3) disrupts the most direct leftward routes (e.g., (4,3) → (3,3) → (2,2) → ... → (2,0) (E)) and limits the cat’s options to other paths that are longer or more easily blocked in subsequent moves.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (4,3) reduces the cat’s escape routes, particularly the critical leftward path, making it harder for the cat to reach an exit quickly.\n\nAnswer: 4 3","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we analyze the cat's current position and its possible paths to exits. The cat is at (3, 4) on an odd row, so its adjacent cells are (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), and (4, 4). The most immediate threat is the cat reaching exits in row 0 (e.g., (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), etc.) via short paths. \n\nKey observations:\n1. The shortest paths from the cat to row 0 exits involve moving through (2, 3) → (1, 3) → (0, 3) or similar 3-step routes.\n2. Blocking (2, 3) directly cuts off the cat's ability to move into this critical cell, which is part of the shortest paths to row 0 exits.\n\nBy placing a wall at (2, 3), the cat loses access to this key node, forcing it to take longer paths that can be blocked in subsequent moves. This disrupts the most immediate escape routes.\n\nAnswer: 2 3","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its possible paths to exits. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (2, 4). We analyze its adjacent cells (since it can move to any adjacent \"0\" cell) and the shortest paths to exits (\"E\").\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat's Position and Adjacent Cells**: The cat is at (2, 4) (row 2, column 4). For even rows (row 2 is even), adjacent cells are:  \n   - (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3) (wall), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5).  \n   The cat can move to (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 4), or (3, 5) (all \"0\" cells).\n\n2. **Immediate Threats to Exits**:  \n   - The top boundary (row 0) contains exits (e.g., (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)).  \n   - From (1, 4) (adjacent to the cat), the cat can move to (0, 3) or (0, 4) (exits) in one subsequent move.  \n   - From (1, 5) (also adjacent to the cat), the cat can move to (0, 4) or (0, 5) (exits) in one subsequent move.  \n\n3. **Critical Path**: The shortest path for the cat to escape is via (1, 4) → (0, 4) (exit), which takes only two moves (cat moves to (1, 4) on its turn, then to (0, 4) on its next turn). Blocking (1, 4) eliminates this immediate threat.\n\n### Decision:\nPlacing a wall at (1, 4) blocks the cat’s shortest path to the top boundary exit (0, 4). This prevents the cat from reaching an exit in two moves and limits its options to longer, more easily blockable paths.\n\nAnswer: 1 4","\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal cell to place a wall to prevent the cat from reaching any exit (\"E\") on the hexagonal board. The cat is currently at position (1, 5), and we need to block its most immediate paths to the exits.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat's Position and Adjacent Cells**: The cat is at (1, 5) (row 1, column 5). For an odd row (r=1), the adjacent cells are:\n   - (0, 4): Exit (\"E\")\n   - (0, 5): Exit (\"E\")\n   - (1, 4): Wall (\"1\")\n   - (1, 6): Empty (\"0\")\n   - (2, 4): Empty (\"0\")\n   - (2, 5): Empty (\"0\")\n\n   The cat can only move to empty cells (\"0\"), so its immediate possible moves are (1, 6), (2, 4), and (2, 5).\n\n2. **Immediate Threat Analysis**: The most critical threat is the cell (1, 6). From (1, 6), the cat is adjacent to (0, 5), which is an exit (\"E\"). If the cat moves to (1, 6), it can then move to (0, 5) in the next turn, resulting in a loss. Blocking (1, 6) eliminates this immediate path to the exit.\n\n3. **Other Paths**: While (2, 4) and (2, 5) are also possible moves for the cat, they do not lead to exits as directly as (1, 6). Blocking (1, 6) prioritizes neutralizing the most immediate and dangerous path.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (1, 6) blocks the cat's shortest and most direct path to an exit, preventing it from reaching the boundary exit in the next move.\n\nAnswer: 1 6"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The cat (\"C\") is located at coordinates (5, 5) on the hexagonal grid. For a cell in an odd row (row 5 is odd), the adjacent cells are: (r-1, c-1), (r-1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1), (r+1, c-1), and (r+1, c). \n\n### Cat's Adjacent Cells:\n- (4, 4): Empty (\"0\")\n- (4, 5): Wall (\"1\")\n- (5, 4): Empty (\"0\")\n- (5, 6): Empty (\"0\")\n- (6, 4): Empty (\"0\")\n- (6, 5): Wall (\"1\")\n\nThus, the cat can move to (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 6), or (6, 4).\n\n### Critical Path Analysis:\nThe cat aims to reach any exit (\"E\") on the boundary. Key escape paths from the cat's position include:\n1. **Top Path**: (5, 5) → (4, 4) → (3, 5) → (2, 5) → (1, 5) → (0, 5) (exit).\n2. **Bottom Path**: (5, 5) → (6, 4) → (7, 4) → (8, 4) → (9, 4) → (10, 4) (exit).\n3. **Left Path**: (5, 5) → (5, 4) → (4, 3) → (3, 3) → (2, 3) → (1, 3) → (0, 3) (exit).\n4. **Right Path**: (5, 5) → (5, 6) → (4, 6) → (3, 6) → (3, 7) → (2, 7) → (1, 7) → (0, 7) (exit).\n\n### Optimal Wall Placement:\nTo block the most critical path, we focus on the left path, which is accessible via (5, 4). Blocking (5, 4) disrupts the left escape route and reduces the cat's options. While the cat can still move to (4, 4), (5, 6), or (6, 4), blocking (5, 4) limits its ability to reach the left boundary exit efficiently. This move is strategic as it targets a key node in one of the shortest escape paths.\n\nAnswer: 5 4","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position at (4,4) and analyze its possible moves. The cat can move to adjacent empty cells: (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), and (5,5). We need to block a cell that disrupts the most critical escape paths to the exits.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Escape Paths to Top Exits (Row 0):** The shortest paths for the cat to reach row 0 exits (e.g., (0,3), (0,5)) involve moving through (3,4) or (3,5). For example:\n   - (4,4) → (3,4) → (2,3) → (1,3) → (0,3) (exit).\n   - (4,4) → (3,4) → (2,4) → (1,4) → (0,5) (exit).\n   - (4,4) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (0,5) (exit).\n\n2. **Critical Chokepoint:** The cell (3,4) is a critical node in two of these top escape paths. Blocking (3,4) disrupts both paths through (3,4), forcing the cat to rely on longer or more restricted paths.\n\n### Analysis of Blocking (3,4):\n- Blocking (3,4) removes the cat's ability to use this cell as a stepping stone to the top exits. The cat’s remaining options are (3,5), (4,3), and (5,5), but these paths are either longer (e.g., (4,3) leads to a left exit in 5 steps) or less direct (e.g., (5,5) leads to a bottom exit in 6+ steps). This delay and restriction significantly reduce the cat’s ability to reach an exit quickly.\n\nThus, placing a wall at (3,4) is the optimal move to hinder the cat’s most immediate escape routes.\n\nAnswer: 3 4","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we analyze the cat's current position and its possible paths to exits. The cat is at (3, 5) (row 3, column 5). For an odd row (row 3), its adjacent cells are: (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4) (wall), (3, 6), (4, 4), and (4, 5) (wall). Thus, the cat can initially move to (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), or (4, 4).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Shortest Paths to Exits**: The most immediate threats are paths leading to the top boundary (row 0), which contains exits. For example:\n   - From (2, 5), the cat can move to (1, 5) → (0, 5) (exit).\n   - From (2, 4), the cat can move to (1, 4) → (0, 3) (exit).\n   - From (3, 6), the cat can move to (3, 7) → (2, 7) → (1, 7) → (0, 7) (exit).\n   - From (4, 4), the cat can move to (4, 3) → (3, 3) → (2, 3) → (1, 3) → (0, 3) (exit).\n\n2. **Critical Cell Identification**: The cell (2, 5) is a critical node in the shortest paths to multiple exits. Blocking (2, 5) disrupts the most direct route to (0, 5) and (0, 6) exits, forcing the cat to take longer, more easily blockable paths.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (2, 5) significantly reduces the cat’s immediate escape routes, making it harder for the cat to reach an exit quickly.\n\nAnswer: 2 5","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (2, 4). For a cell at (r, c) where r is even (r=2), the adjacent cells are (r-1, c), (r-1, c+1), (r, c-1), (r, c+1), (r+1, c), and (r+1, c+1). \n\n### Cat's Adjacent Cells:\n- **(1, 4)**: Empty (\"0\"), adjacent to exit (0, 3) (E).\n- **(1, 5)**: Empty (\"0\"), adjacent to exit (0, 5) (E).\n- **(2, 3)**: Empty (\"0\"), leading to exit (0, 2) (E) via (1, 3).\n- **(3, 5)**: Empty (\"0\"), but this path to exits is longer.\n\n### Key Threats:\nThe most immediate threats are the cat reaching exits (0, 3) or (0, 5) in 2 steps:  \n- (2, 4) → (1, 4) → (0, 3) (exit).  \n- (2, 4) → (1, 5) → (0, 5) (exit).  \n\n### Strategy:\nBlocking either (1, 4) or (1, 5) disrupts the shortest escape paths. Blocking (1, 4) directly cuts off the path to (0, 3) and also hinders the (2, 3) → (1, 4) → (0, 3) route. This reduces the cat’s options and delays its escape.\n\nAnswer: 1 4","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is located at coordinates (1, 5) on the hexagonal grid. \n\n### Cat's Position and Adjacent Cells\nFor a cell at (r, c) where r is odd (r=1 in this case), the adjacent cells are:\n- (r-1, c-1) = (0, 4) → Wall (\"1\")\n- (r-1, c) = (0, 5) → Exit (\"E\")\n- (r, c-1) = (1, 4) → Wall (\"1\")\n- (r, c+1) = (1, 6) → Empty (\"0\")\n- (r+1, c-1) = (2, 4) → Empty (\"0\")\n- (r+1, c) = (2, 5) → Wall (\"1\")\n\nThe cat can only move to adjacent empty cells (\"0\"), so its possible moves are to (1, 6) and (2, 4).\n\n### Threat Analysis\nThe cat aims to reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary. The exits are on the grid's edges (top, bottom, left, right). To prevent the cat from escaping, we need to block its paths to these exits. \n\n#### Path 1: (1, 5) → (1, 6)\nFrom (1, 6), the cat can move right toward the boundary (c=10, which is an exit). The cells (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9) are all empty, leading directly toward the right boundary exit at (1, 10). This path is a direct and immediate threat.\n\n#### Path 2: (1, 5) → (2, 4)\nFrom (2, 4), the cat can move left or down, but these paths are longer and less direct to any boundary exit compared to the rightward path from (1, 6).\n\n### Optimal Move\nBlocking (1, 6) (the immediate rightward move) cuts off the most direct path to the right boundary exit. This forces the cat to take the longer, less critical path through (2, 4), which is easier to contain in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: 1 6"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

These are the immediate cells the cat can move to.\n2. **Shortest Escape Paths**: The shortest paths to exits (E) are via the top boundary (row 0).

This is another critical 3-step path.\n\nTo block the most immediate escape routes, we focus on cells in these paths. Blocking (9, 3) disrupts the first path, as (9, 3) is the cell the cat would need to reach to exit via (10, 3) from (8, 3). Similarly, blocking (9, 4) disrupts the second path. However, (9, 3) is part of a shorter or equally critical path and is more immediately threatening.\n\nThus, placing a wall at (9, 3) prevents the cat from using the shortest escape route via (8, 3) → (9, 3) → (10, 3).\n\nAnswer: 9 3","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is located at (8, 4) (row 8, column 4). Since row 8 is even, the cat's adjacent cells are: (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 4), and (9, 5). Among these, (8, 5) is a wall (\"1\"), so the cat can move to the remaining five cells: (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 3), (9, 4), and (9, 5).\n\nThe cat’s goal is to reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary. Key exits near the cat’s position include (10, 3) and (10, 5) in row 10, which are directly adjacent to (9, 4) and (9, 5), respectively. If the cat moves to (9, 4), it can reach (10, 3) (an exit) in one subsequent move. Similarly, moving to (9, 5) allows the cat to reach (10, 5) (another exit) in one move. These are the shortest and most immediate escape paths.\n\nTo prevent the cat from reaching an exit, we must block one of these critical cells. Blocking (9, 4) eliminates the cat’s ability to use the shortest path to (10, 3). While the cat could still attempt other paths (e.g., via (9, 5) or (7, 5)), blocking (9, 4) significantly reduces the cat’s immediate escape options and forces it to take longer, more vulnerable paths that can be blocked in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: 9 4","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's current position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (9, 5). For a cell in an odd row (r=9 is odd), the adjacent cells are: (r-1, c-1) = (8, 4), (r-1, c) = (8, 5), (r, c-1) = (9, 4), (r, c+1) = (9, 6), (r+1, c-1) = (10, 4), and (r+1, c) = (10, 5). \n\nAnalyzing these adjacent cells:\n- (8, 5), (9, 4), (10, 4) are walls (\"1\").\n- (10, 5) is an exit (\"E\"), but the cat can only move to exits if no empty cells (\"0\") are available.\n- (8, 4) and (9, 6) are empty cells (\"0\"), so these are the cat's immediate possible moves.\n\nThe cat aims to reach any exit. A critical observation is that (9, 6) is part of a direct path along row 9 towards the exit at (9, 10) (since (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9) are all empty, leading to (9, 10) \"E\"). Blocking (9, 6) cuts off this escape route.\n\nBy placing a wall at (9, 6), the cat’s only remaining move is to (8, 4). This forces the cat into a region with more existing walls (e.g., row 6 has walls at (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 10)), making it easier to trap the cat in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: 9 6"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

This cell is part of the 4-step path to the exit at (0,4).

The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (3, 5). For a cell in an odd row (r=3 is odd), its adjacent cells are: (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4) (wall), (3, 6), (4, 4), and (4, 5). The cat can move to the 0-valued cells: (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), and (4, 5).\n\n### Key Threat Analysis:\nThe cat’s most urgent escape paths lead to top-row exits (\"E\") in row 0, which are only 3 moves away. Critical paths include:\n1. **(3, 5) → (2, 5) → (1, 5) → (0, 5) (E)**: Shortest path to exit (3 moves).\n2. **(3, 5) → (2, 5) → (1, 6) → (0, 6) (E)**: Another short path via (2, 5) (3 moves).\n3. **(3, 5) → (2, 4) → (1, 4) → (0, 4) (E)**: Short path via (2, 4) (3 moves).\n\n### Optimal Block:\nBlocking (2, 5) disrupts the two most immediate escape paths (paths 1 and 2) that use (2, 5) as a critical intermediate step. This reduces the cat’s options and delays its access to the top exits. While (2, 4) remains a valid move, blocking (2, 5) significantly limits the cat’s shortest escape routes.\n\nAnswer: 2 5","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its adjacent cells. The cat (\"C\") is located at (2, 4) in the 11×11 hexagonal grid. For a cell at (r, c) where r is even (r=2), the adjacent cells are: (r-1, c) = (1, 4), (r-1, c+1) = (1, 5), (r, c-1) = (2, 3), (r, c+1) = (2, 5) (wall), (r+1, c) = (3, 4) (wall), and (r+1, c+1) = (3, 5). Thus, the cat’s valid adjacent empty cells (\"0\") are (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), and (3, 5).\n\nThe cat’s goal is to reach any exit (\"E\") on the boundary. The most immediate threats are exits in row 0 (top boundary), such as (0, 4) and (0, 5), which are only one move away from (1, 4) and (1, 5), respectively. If the cat moves to (1, 4) or (1, 5), it can reach these exits in the next turn. \n\nTo block the most critical path, we focus on (1, 4), which is adjacent to the exit (0, 4). Placing a wall at (1, 4) prevents the cat from using this direct route to the exit. While the cat could still move to (1, 5), (2, 3), or (3, 5), these paths are longer and allow more opportunities to block subsequent moves in future turns. However, blocking (1, 4) immediately neutralizes the shortest and most dangerous path.\n\nAnswer: 1 4","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the cat's position and possible paths to exits. The cat is at (1,5) on an 11×11 hexagonal grid. The cat can only move to adjacent empty cells (\"0\") and aims to reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary. Our goal is to place a wall (\"1\") on an empty cell to block the cat's escape routes.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat's Position and Adjacency**: The cat is at (1,5) (odd row). Its adjacent cells are:\n   - (0,4) and (0,5) (both \"E\", exits, but the cat cannot move into \"E\" cells as they are not empty).\n   - (1,4) and (2,5) (both \"1\", walls, impassable).\n   - (1,6) and (2,4) (both \"0\", empty, so the cat's only possible moves).\n\n2. **Critical Paths**: The cat’s immediate escape routes depend on moving to (1,6) or (2,4). We need to block the more critical path to the boundary exits.\n   - **Path via (1,6)**: Leads to cells like (1,7), (1,8), etc., but these eventually face walls or require navigating around obstacles.\n   - **Path via (2,4)**: Leads directly downward through rows 3–10, with a clear vertical path to the boundary exit at (10,4) (an \"E\" cell in row 10). This path is more direct and less obstructed.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nBlocking (2,4) cuts off the cat’s most direct path to the lower boundary exit.

The most direct path is the leftward path along row 4: (4,4) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (4,1) → (4,0) (exit). This path is critical because it is straight and requires minimal steps.\n3. **Blocking the Critical Path**: Blocking (4,3) (adjacent to the cat) cuts off the leftward path.

The cat is at (5,5) and aims to reach any boundary exit (\"E\"). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat's Adjacent Cells**: The cat has six adjacent cells: (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), all of which are empty (\"0\").\n2. **Shortest Paths to Exits**: The cat can reach exits in 5 steps via three primary paths:\n   - **Path 1**: (5,5) → (4,4) → (3,4) → (2,4) → (1,4) → (0,4) (exit in row 0).\n   - **Path 2**: (5,5) → (4,5)\/(5,6) → (3,5)\/(3,6) → (2,5)\/(2,6) → (1,6) → (0,5) (exit in row 0).\n   - **Path 3**: (5,5) → (6,5) → (7,5) → (8,5) → (9,5) → (10,5) (exit in row 10).\n3. **Chokepoints**: Each exit has a critical chokepoint cell that, if blocked, cuts off all paths to that exit:\n   - (1,4) blocks the path to (0,4).\n   - (1,6) blocks the path to (0,5) (since (0,5) is only reachable via (1,6) in row 1, as (1,5) is a wall).\n   - (9,5) blocks the path to (10,5).\n\n### Optimal Move:\nBlocking (1,6) is most effective because (0,5) is reachable via two paths (through (4,5) and (5,6)), and (1,6) is the only cell in row 1 that connects to (0,5). By placing a wall at (1,6), both paths to (0,5) are blocked, significantly reducing the cat's escape routes.\n\nAnswer: 1 6","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we analyze the cat's possible paths to exits and identify critical nodes that block the shortest escape routes. \n\n### Cat's Position and Adjacent Cells\nThe cat is at (4,4) (row 4, column 4). Its adjacent cells (even row) are (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,4), and (5,5), all of which are empty (\"0\"). The cat can move to any of these cells on its turn.\n\n### Shortest Paths to Exits\nThe cat’s goal is to reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary. Key exits within shortest reach are:\n1. **Exit (4,0)**: A 4-step path: (4,4) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (4,1) → (4,0).\n2. **Exit (0,4)**: Another 4-step path: (4,4) → (3,4) → (2,4) → (1,4) → (0,4).\n\n### Critical Nodes to Block\nTo prevent the cat from escaping, we must block one of these shortest paths. The most critical nodes in these paths are:\n- **(4,1)**: Part of the path to (4,0). Blocking (4,1) cuts off the cat’s direct route to (4,0).\n- **(1,4)**: Part of the path to (0,4). Blocking (1,4) cuts off the direct route to (0,4).\n\n### Optimal Move\nBlocking (4,1) is chosen because it directly disrupts the shortest path to the nearby exit (4,0). If (4,1) is walled, the cat cannot proceed from (4,2) to (4,1), forcing it to take a longer, 5-step path to alternative exits (e.g., (0,3)). This maximizes the cat’s minimal distance to any exit, increasing the chance of trapping it.\n\nAnswer: 4 1","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the cat's position and its potential paths to exits. The cat is at (3,4) on an 11×11 hexagonal grid. The goal is to block the cat's shortest paths to any exit (\"E\") by placing a wall (\"1\") on an empty cell (\"0\").\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat's Adjacent Cells**: The cat (at (3,4), an odd row) has six adjacent cells: (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), and (4,4). All are empty (\"0\"), so the cat can move to any of these.\n2. **Shortest Paths to Exits**: The closest exits are on the top boundary (row 0). The shortest paths from the cat to these exits are:\n   - Path 1: (3,4) → (2,3) → (1,3) → (0,2) (exit).\n   - Path 2: (3,4) → (2,4) → (1,4) → (0,3) (exit).\n   - Path 3: (3,4) → (2,4) → (1,4) → (0,4) (exit).  \n   These paths are 3 steps long, making them the most immediate threats.\n\n### Critical Cell Identification:\nThe cell (1,4) is critical because it is part of two of the shortest paths (Paths 2 and 3). Blocking (1,4) cuts off access to exits (0,3) and (0,4) via (2,4) → (1,4). While the cat could still use Path 1, blocking (1,4) significantly reduces the cat’s options and delays its escape.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (1,4) is the optimal move to disrupt the cat’s most immediate paths to the top exits.\n\nAnswer: 1 4","\nTo determine the optimal wall placement, we first identify the cat's position and its possible escape paths. The cat is at (2, 3) (row 2, column 3). Using the hex grid adjacency rules (even row: (r-1,c), (r-1,c+1), (r,c-1), (r,c+1), (r+1,c), (r+1,c+1)), the cat's adjacent cells are (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,3), and (3,4). Among these, (1,4) is a wall, so the cat can move to (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,3), or (3,4).\n\nThe most immediate threat is the cat reaching an exit (\"E\") on the boundary. The shortest escape path for the cat is via (1,3) → (0,3), where (0,3) is an exit in row 0. This path takes only two moves: (2,3) → (1,3) → (0,3). Blocking (1,3) eliminates this critical short path.\n\nOther potential paths (e.g., (2,3) → (2,2) → (1,2) → (0,2)) are longer (three moves) and less urgent. By placing a wall at (1,3), we block the shortest and most direct escape route, significantly reducing the cat's ability to reach an exit quickly.\n\nAnswer: 1 3","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its adjacent cells. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (2, 2). For a cell in an even row (r=2 is even), the adjacent cells are: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), and (3, 3). Among these, (1, 3) and (3, 2) are walls (\"1\"), leaving (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 3) as possible moves for the cat.\n\n### Key Threat Analysis:\nThe cat aims to reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary. The most immediate threats are paths leading to exits in 2 moves (cat's current position → adjacent cell → exit):\n1. **Path 1**: (2, 2) → (1, 2) → (0, 1) E.  \n   - (1, 2) is an empty cell (\"0\") adjacent to the exit (0, 1) E (row 0, column 1).  \n2. **Path 2**: (2, 2) → (2, 1) → (2, 0) E.  \n   - (2, 1) is an empty cell (\"0\") adjacent to the exit (2, 0) E (row 2, column 0).  \n\n### Critical Blocking Move:\nBoth (1, 2) and (2, 1) are critical, as they allow the cat to reach an exit in one subsequent move. Blocking either would eliminate one of these immediate escape routes. Between the two, (1, 2) is adjacent to two exits: (0, 1) E and (0, 2) E (row 0, column 2), making it a more critical chokepoint. Placing a wall at (1, 2) blocks both exits reachable from this cell, significantly reducing the cat's immediate escape options.\n\nAnswer: 1 2","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible paths to exits. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (2, 1). Exits (\"E\") are on the boundary of the 11×11 grid. The cat can only move to adjacent empty cells (\"0\") on its turn. Our goal is to block the cat's paths to any exit by placing a wall (\"1\") on an empty cell.\n\n### Cat's Position and Adjacent Cells\nThe cat is at (2, 1) (even row). Its adjacent cells are:\n- (1, 1): \"0\" (empty)\n- (1, 2): \"1\" (wall)\n- (2, 0): \"E\" (exit, not empty)\n- (2, 2): \"0\" (empty)\n- (3, 1): \"0\" (empty)\n- (3, 2): \"1\" (wall)\n\nThus, the cat can initially move to (1, 1), (2, 2), or (3, 1).\n\n### Analysis of Possible Cat Moves\n- **(1, 1)**: Adjacent cells are mostly \"E\" (exits) or \"1\" (walls). The cat would be stuck here with no further moves.\n- **(3, 1)**: Adjacent cells are mostly \"E\" (exits) or \"1\" (walls). The cat would also be stuck here with no further moves.\n- **(2, 2)**: This cell leads to a longer path toward the boundary exit at (2, 10) (column 10). From (2, 2), the cat can move right through (2, 3), (2, 4), ..., (2, 9) to reach (2, 10) (exit). This is the only viable path for the cat to escape.\n\n### Blocking the Critical Path\nTo prevent the cat from reaching the exit, we must block the critical cell in its primary escape path. The cell (2, 2) is the first step in this path. Placing a wall here cuts off the cat’s access to the longer escape route, forcing it into dead-end cells (1, 1) or (3, 1), where it will be trapped.\n\nAnswer: 2 2"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (5, 5) (row 5, column 5). For a cell in an odd row (row 5 is odd), the adjacent cells are: (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6) (blocked by a wall), (6, 4), and (6, 5). Thus, the cat can initially move to (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), or (6, 5).\n\nNext, we analyze the cat's potential paths to exits (\"E\") on the boundary. Key observations include:\n- **Path to exit (0, 5)**: The cat could move (5, 5) → (4, 5) → (3, 6) → (2, 6) → (1, 6) → (0, 5) (5 steps).\n- **Path to exit (4, 0)**: The cat could move (5, 5) → (5, 4) → (5, 3) → (5, 2) → (5, 1) → (4, 0) (5 steps).\n- Other paths to exits are longer (6–7 steps).\n\nThe shortest paths are to (0, 5) and (4, 0), both requiring 5 steps. Blocking a critical first step in these paths is essential. The cell (4, 5) is the first step in the shortest path to (0, 5), and blocking it eliminates this route. This reduces the cat's options and forces it to rely on longer paths, increasing the chance of trapping it in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: 4 5","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the cat's current position and its possible escape paths. The cat is at (6,4) and can move to adjacent empty cells (0). The goal is to block the most critical path to an exit.\n\n### Cat's Position and Adjacent Cells:\nThe cat at (6,4) (even row) has adjacent cells: (5,4), (5,5), (6,3) (wall), (6,5), (7,4), (7,5). The valid moves are to (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (7,5) (all 0).\n\n### Key Escape Paths:\nThe shortest path to an exit (row 10, all E) is through (7,5) → (8,5) → (9,5) → (10,5), which is only 4 moves. Blocking (7,5) disrupts this critical path, forcing the cat to take longer routes.\n\n### Analysis of Blocking (7,5):\n- Blocking (7,5) removes the cat's ability to use this direct downward path to row 10.\n- Other paths (e.g., upward to row 0 or left\/right to column 0\/10) are longer and less immediate, giving more time to block additional paths in subsequent turns.\n\nThus, placing a wall at (7,5) is the optimal first move to hinder the cat's shortest escape route.\n\nAnswer: 7 5","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we analyze the cat's current position, possible moves, and paths to exits. The cat is at (7,4) (row 7, column 4) on an 11×11 hexagonal grid. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat's Adjacent Cells**: For a cat at (r, c) in an odd row (r=7), the adjacent cells are:\n   - (6, 3) [wall], (6, 4) [empty], (7, 3) [empty], (7, 5) [wall], (8, 3) [wall], (8, 4) [empty].  \n   Thus, the cat can move to three empty cells: (6, 4), (7, 3), or (8, 4).\n\n2. **Threat Analysis**: The most immediate threat is the shortest path to an exit. The cat can reach row 10 (all exits) via (8, 4) → (9, 4) → (10, 4) in 3 steps. This is the shortest path compared to longer paths toward row 0 or column 0.\n\n3. **Blocking Strategy**: To neutralize the immediate threat, we block the cat’s access to the shortest path. Blocking (8, 4) prevents the cat from moving toward row 10, forcing it to take longer paths that are easier to counter in subsequent turns.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (8, 4) blocks the cat’s most direct route to an exit, reducing its options and buying time to block other paths.\n\nAnswer: 8 4","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (7, 3) in the 11×11 hexagonal grid. For a cell at (r, c) where r is odd (7 is odd), the adjacent cells are: (r-1, c-1), (r-1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r+1, c). \n\n### Cat's Adjacent Cells:\n- (6, 2): Empty (\"0\")\n- (6, 3): Wall (\"1\")\n- (7, 2): Empty (\"0\")\n- (7, 4): Empty (\"0\")\n- (8, 2): Empty (\"0\")\n- (8, 3): Wall (\"1\")\n\nThus, the cat can initially move to (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 4), or (8, 2).\n\n### Key Observations:\nThe cat aims to reach any boundary exit (\"E\"). To trap the cat, we need to block a critical cell that disrupts the most escape paths. \n\n1. **Path via (7, 2)**: This cell is part of multiple short escape routes, such as:\n   - (7, 3) → (7, 2) → (6, 1) → (6, 0) (E)\n   - (7, 3) → (7, 2) → (8, 1) → (8, 0) (E)\n   - (7, 3) → (7, 2) → (7, 1) → (6, 0) (E)\n\n2. **Criticality of (7, 2)**: Blocking (7, 2) disrupts these short paths to nearby exits (e.g., (6, 0), (8, 0)). While the cat may still attempt longer paths via other cells (e.g., (6, 2), (7, 4), (8, 2)), (7, 2) is a central node in the most immediate escape routes, making it the highest-priority target to delay or block the cat’s progress.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (7, 2) is the optimal move to restrict the cat’s access to critical exits and increase the difficulty of escaping.\n\nAnswer: 7 2","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position. The cat (\"C\") is located at (8, 2) (row 8, column 2). Next, we analyze the cat's possible adjacent moves based on the hexagonal grid rules. For a cat at (r, c) in an even row (r=8 is even), the adjacent cells are:\n\n- (7, 2): Wall (\"1\") → blocked.\n- (7, 3): Empty (\"0\") → possible move.\n- (8, 1): Empty (\"0\") → possible move.\n- (8, 3): Wall (\"1\") → blocked.\n- (9, 2): Empty (\"0\") → possible move.\n- (9, 3): Wall (\"1\") → blocked.\n\nThus, the cat can move to (7, 3), (8, 1), or (9, 2) on its next turn. We need to block the most critical path that allows the cat to reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary.\n\n### Key Analysis of Threats:\n- **(8, 1)**: Adjacent to (8, 0), which is an exit (\"E\"). If the cat moves to (8, 1), it can immediately escape to (8, 0) on its next turn. This is the most immediate threat.\n- **(9, 2)**: Adjacent to (10, 1) and (10, 2), both exits (\"E\"). If the cat moves to (9, 2), it can escape to these exits on its next turn.\n- **(7, 3)**: Further from exits, with no immediate escape paths.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nBlocking (8, 1) eliminates the most immediate threat, as the cat would otherwise reach an exit in one move. Placing a wall at (8, 1) prevents this critical escape route.\n\nAnswer: 8 1","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is located at coordinates (9, 2). \n\n### Cat's Position and Adjacent Cells:\nThe cat is on an odd row (r=9), so its adjacent cells are:\n- (8, 1): Wall (\"1\")\n- (8, 2): Empty (\"0\")\n- (9, 1): Empty (\"0\")\n- (9, 3): Wall (\"1\")\n- (10, 1): Exit (\"E\")\n- (10, 2): Exit (\"E\")\n\nThe cat can only move to adjacent empty cells (\"0\"), so its valid moves are (8, 2) and (9, 1). Exits (\"E\") are not empty cells, so the cat cannot move into them directly.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Cat Moves:\n1. **Move to (8, 2)**: This cell is empty. From (8, 2) (even row), adjacent cells include (7, 3) (empty), which leads to further potential movement (e.g., (6, 2) and (7, 4) are also empty). This path could allow the cat to escape deeper into the board, increasing the risk of reaching an exit.\n   \n2. **Move to (9, 1)**: This cell is empty. From (9, 1) (odd row), all adjacent cells are either walls (\"1\") or exits (\"E\"). No further moves are possible from (9, 1), making it a dead end. If the cat moves here, it will be trapped.\n\n### Optimal Wall Placement:\nTo prevent the cat from escaping, we must block the more dangerous path. Blocking (8, 2) eliminates the cat’s ability to move into a path with further escape potential. This leaves (9, 1) as the only valid move for the cat, which is a dead end.\n\nAnswer: 8 2"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (5,5). For a cell in an odd row (row 5), the adjacent cells are: (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,5). Among these, (5,6) is a wall (\"1\"), so the cat can move to (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (6,4), or (6,5).\n\nNext, we analyze the paths from these adjacent cells to any exit (\"E\") on the boundary. Key observations:\n- **(4,5)**: This cell is critical as it lies on multiple shortest paths to exits. From (4,5), the cat can move to (3,5) or (3,6), both leading to exits in 4 additional steps (e.g., (3,5) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (0,5) (exit) or (3,6) → (2,6) → (1,6) → (0,6) (exit)). Blocking (4,5) cuts off these direct paths.\n- Other adjacent cells (e.g., (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)) are part of longer or less critical paths, but none are as central to multiple short paths as (4,5).\n\nPlacing a wall at (4,5) disrupts the most immediate and dangerous routes the cat could take to reach an exit.\n\nAnswer: 4 5","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the cat's current position (4,4) and its potential paths to exits. The cat can move to adjacent empty cells (0) based on hexagonal grid rules. Key observations include:\n\n### Cat's Adjacent Cells (Row 4 is even):\n- (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5) (wall), (5,4), (5,5).  \nThe cat can move to (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (5,4), or (5,5) (since (4,5) is a wall).\n\n### Critical Paths to Exits:\n1. **Path via (4,3)**: The cat moving to (4,3) can quickly reach the exit (4,0) by moving left: (4,3) → (4,2) → (4,1) → (4,0) (E). This is the shortest path (4 steps).  \n2. **Other paths** (via (3,4), (3,5), (5,4), (5,5)) are longer but still viable.  \n\n### Optimal Block:\nBlocking (4,3) directly cuts off the shortest path to the exit. Placing a wall here prevents the cat from moving left toward (4,0), forcing it to rely on longer, more easily blockable paths.\n\nAnswer: 4 3","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first analyze the cat's current position and its possible escape paths. The cat (\"C\") is located at coordinates (3, 4) (row 3, column 4). Since row 3 is odd, the cat’s adjacent cells are: (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 3), and (4, 4). Among these, (2, 4) and (4, 3) are walls (\"1\"), so the cat can move to (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 5), or (4, 4) (all \"0\").\n\n### Key Escape Paths\nThe cat’s goal is to reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary. The most immediate threats are paths leading to the top boundary (row 0), as these are the shortest:\n1. **Path 1**: (3, 4) → (2, 3) → (1, 3) → (0, 3) (E)  \n2. **Path 2**: (3, 4) → (3, 3) → (2, 2) → (1, 2) → (0, 2) (E)  \n3. **Path 3**: (3, 4) → (3, 5) → (2, 5) → (1, 5) → (0, 5) (E)  \n\n### Strategy\nTo block the cat, we need to disrupt the most critical escape paths. Path 1 is particularly urgent because (2, 3) is a direct step toward the top boundary. Blocking (2, 3) prevents the cat from moving up to (1, 3), which is one step away from the exit (0, 3). This reduces the cat’s options and delays its access to the top boundary.\n\n### Conclusion\nPlacing a wall at (2, 3) blocks the shortest and most immediate escape path, forcing the cat to rely on longer, more easily blockable paths.\n\nAnswer: 2 3","\nTo determine the optimal wall placement, we first identify the cat's position at (3,3). The cat aims to reach any boundary exit (\"E\") through adjacent empty cells (\"0\"). We need to block its shortest paths to these exits.\n\n### Cat's Adjacent Cells (r=3, odd):\nThe cat can move to:\n- (2,2), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2) (all \"0\").\n\n### Critical Paths to Exits:\nThe cat can reach exits in 3 steps via:\n1. (3,3) → (3,2) → (3,1) → (3,0) (exit)\n2. (3,3) → (3,2) → (3,1) → (2,0) (exit)\n3. (3,3) → (4,2) → (4,1) → (4,0) (exit)\n4. (3,3) → (2,2) → (1,2) → (0,1) (exit)\n5. (3,3) → (2,2) → (1,3) → (0,2) (exit)\n\n### Key Chokepoint:\nThe cell (3,1) is critical as it lies on two shortest paths to exits (3,0 and 2,0). Blocking (3,1) cuts off these two exit routes, significantly limiting the cat's options.\n\n### Verification:\n- (3,1) is an empty cell (\"0\"), making it a valid wall placement.\n- Blocking (3,1) prevents the cat from using (3,2) → (3,1) to reach (3,0) or (2,0), forcing the cat to rely on longer or more easily blocked paths.\n\nAnswer: 3 1","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible escape paths. The cat (\"C\") is located at coordinates (2, 2). For a cell in an even row (r=2 is even), the adjacent cells are (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1) (wall), (2, 3) (wall), (3, 2), and (3, 3). The cat can only move to empty cells (\"0\"), so its immediate possible moves are (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 2), and (3, 3).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Immediate Threats**: The cat can reach exits (\"E\") on the boundary (row 0) in two moves via (1, 2) → (0, 1) E or (1, 3) → (0, 2) E. These are the shortest escape paths.\n2. **Blocking Critical Paths**: The cells (1, 2) and (1, 3) are critical because they are adjacent to exits in row 0. Blocking either would disrupt one of the shortest escape routes. \n\n### Analysis of Critical Cells:\n- **(1, 2)**: Adjacent to (0, 1) E (exit) and (0, 2) E (exit). If the cat moves to (1, 2), it can escape to either exit in the next turn.\n- **(1, 3)**: Adjacent to (0, 2) E (exit) and (0, 3) E (exit). Similarly, if the cat moves to (1, 3), it can escape to these exits.\n\n### Decision:\nBlocking (1, 2) disrupts the most immediate and direct escape path to (0, 1) E. This reduces the cat's options and delays its ability to reach an exit.\n\nAnswer: 1 2","\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal move to place a wall such that the cat (\"C\") is trapped and cannot reach any exit (\"E\") on the boundary. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat's Current Position**: The cat is located at coordinates (1, 3) (row 1, column 3).\n2. **Adjacent Cells**: For a cell at (r, c) where r is odd (as in the cat's case, r=1), the adjacent cells are:\n   - (r-1, c-1) = (0, 2) → \"E\" (exit)\n   - (r-1, c) = (0, 3) → \"E\" (exit)\n   - (r, c-1) = (1, 2) → \"1\" (wall)\n   - (r, c+1) = (1, 4) → \"1\" (wall)\n   - (r+1, c-1) = (2, 2) → \"0\" (empty)\n   - (r+1, c) = (2, 3) → \"1\" (wall)\n\n3. **Cat's Possible Moves**: The cat can only move to adjacent empty cells (\"0\"). From the cat's current position (1, 3), the only adjacent empty cell is (2, 2). If this cell is blocked, the cat will have no valid moves left.\n\n### Strategy:\nBy placing a wall at (2, 2), we block the cat's only possible move. After this move, all adjacent cells to the cat will be either walls (\"1\") or exits (\"E\"). Since the cat cannot move to exits (\"E\") (as they are not empty cells), it will be trapped with no valid moves, resulting in a win.\n\nAnswer: 2 2"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Among these, (4,5) is a wall, leaving five empty cells: (4,4), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,5).\n\n### Key Path Analysis:\nThe cat aims to reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary (rows 0 or 10, or columns 0\/10 of any row).

Among these, (4,4) is a critical chokepoint for the shortest upward path to row 0. By placing a wall at (4,4), we eliminate the cat's ability to use this 4-step path to the top boundary exit.\n\nAnswer: 4 4","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we analyze the cat's current position and possible escape paths. The cat is at (5,4) (row 5, column 4) on an odd row, so its adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), and (6,4).

Critical paths include:\n   - Westward paths to column 0 exits (e.g., (4,0), (3,0)).\n   - Eastward paths to column 10 exits (e.g., (5,10), (7,10)).\n   - Southward paths to row 10 exits.\n\n2. **Critical Cell Analysis**: The cell (5,5) is adjacent to the cat and lies on the shortest eastward path to (5,10). Blocking (5,5) directly cuts off this primary eastward escape route. While the cat may still attempt other paths (e.g., westward or southward), blocking (5,5) significantly reduces the cat's options and forces it to take longer, more vulnerable paths.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (5,5) disrupts the most direct eastward escape path, limiting the cat's mobility and increasing the difficulty of reaching an exit.\n\nAnswer: 5 5","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at (4, 3) (row 4, column 3). For a cell in an even row (row 4 is even), the adjacent cells are: (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 3), and (5, 4). Checking these cells, the cat can move to (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 3), and (5, 4) (all \"0\" cells).\n\nNext, we analyze the cat's potential paths to exits (\"E\") on the boundary. The most critical threat is the path through (4, 2) → (4, 1) → (4, 0), where (4, 0) is an exit. If the cat reaches (4, 1), it can move to (4, 0) (exit) in the next turn. Blocking (4, 1) would cut off this direct and immediate escape route.\n\nOther paths, such as (3, 3) → (3, 2) → (3, 1) → (3, 0) (exit), are longer and less urgent. Placing a wall at (4, 1) neutralizes the most immediate threat.\n\nAnswer: 4 1","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we analyze the cat's current position, its possible moves, and the shortest paths to exits.

Path 1 is particularly urgent because (3, 0) is a boundary exit (c=0) and requires only 3 moves (cat’s turns) to reach. Blocking (3, 1) disrupts this path, as (3, 1) is the intermediate cell between (3, 2) and (3, 0).\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (3, 1) blocks the shortest path to the exit (3, 0), forcing the cat to take longer, more easily blockable paths.\n\nAnswer: 3 1","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its adjacent cells.

To prevent this, we must block one of these critical cells. Since we can only place one wall, blocking either (1, 3) or (1, 4) disrupts the shortest escape path. \n\nBetween these two, (1, 3) is chosen as the optimal move to block the cat’s immediate escape through (0, 2).\n\nAnswer: 1 3","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves.

Blocking (4,5) directly disrupts the most immediate upward escape route, forcing the cat to take longer or more vulnerable paths.\n\nAnswer: 4 5","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we analyze the cat's current position and potential escape paths. The cat is at (4,4) (row 4, column 4) and can move to adjacent empty cells (\"0\"). The goal is to block a critical cell that disrupts the shortest escape routes to exits (\"E\").\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat's Position and Adjacent Cells**: The cat (at (4,4), even row) has 5 possible moves: (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (5,4), and (5,5) (all \"0\").\n2. **Shortest Escape Paths**: The closest exits are 4 steps away:\n   - **Left Exit (4,0)**: Path: (4,4) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (4,1) → (4,0).\n   - **Top Exits (0,3) and (0,5)**: Paths: (4,4) → (3,4) → (2,3) → (1,3) → (0,3) and (4,4) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (0,5).\n   - **Bottom Exits**: Longer paths (6+ steps) due to existing walls.\n\n3. **Critical Cell Analysis**: Blocking (4,3) directly disrupts the shortest path to the left exit (4,0). This cell is part of the most immediate and unobstructed escape route. If (4,3) is blocked, the cat cannot reach (4,0) via the direct left path, and alternative routes to this exit are either blocked by walls or significantly longer.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (4,3) eliminates the shortest escape path to the left exit, reducing the cat's options and increasing the difficulty of reaching any exit.\n\nAnswer: 4 3","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we analyze the cat's position, adjacent cells, and potential escape paths to exits. The cat is at (3, 4) (row 3, column 4). For a cat in an odd row (row 3), adjacent cells are: (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4). Among these, (2, 4) and (4, 3) are walls, leaving (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 5), and (4, 4) as valid initial moves.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Shortest Escape Paths**: The cat can reach exits on the top boundary (row 0) in 3 moves via paths like:\n   - (3, 4) → (2, 3) → (1, 3) → (0, 3) (exit)\n   - (3, 4) → (2, 3) → (1, 4) → (0, 4) (exit)\n   These paths rely on the cell (2, 3) as a critical intermediate step.\n\n2. **Blocking Strategy**: To disrupt the most immediate escape routes, blocking (2, 3) is critical. This cell is part of both shortest paths identified above. By placing a wall at (2, 3), the cat is forced to take longer, less direct paths, increasing the opportunity to block subsequent moves.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBlocking (2, 3) disrupts the shortest and most direct escape paths, significantly reducing the cat's ability to reach an exit quickly.\n\nAnswer: 2 3","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (3, 3). For a cat at (r, c) where r is odd (r=3), the adjacent cells are: (r-1, c-1)=(2,2), (r-1, c)=(2,3), (r, c-1)=(3,2), (r, c+1)=(3,4), (r+1, c-1)=(4,2), and (r+1, c)=(4,3). Among these, the valid empty cells (\"0\") the cat can move to are (2,2), (3,4), and (4,2).\n\n### Key Threat Analysis:\nThe cat aims to reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary. We analyze the shortest paths from the cat to exits:\n1. **Path via (2,2)**: The cat moves to (2,2), then to (1,3) (row 1, c=3), and finally to (0,2) (an exit in row 0, c=2).\n2. **Path via (2,2) → (2,1)**: The cat moves to (2,2), then to (2,1) (row 2, c=1), and finally to (2,0) (an exit in row 2, c=0).\n3. **Path via (4,2)**: The cat moves to (4,2), then to (4,1) (row 4, c=1), and finally to (4,0) (an exit in row 4, c=0).\n\n### Critical Cells to Block:\nThe shortest paths rely on intermediate cells: (1,3), (2,1), and (4,1). Blocking these cells cuts off direct access to exits. Among these, (4,1) is critical because it is part of the path to (4,0), an exit in the first column (c=0), and blocking it prevents the cat from escaping via this route.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (4,1) blocks the most immediate and direct path the cat could take to reach an exit. This move significantly reduces the cat's options to escape.\n\nAnswer: 4 1","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (2, 2) (row 2, column 2). For a cell in an even row (row 2 is even), the adjacent cells are: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), and (3, 3). Checking these cells:\n\n- (1, 2): Wall (\"1\")  \n- (1, 3): Empty (\"0\")  \n- (2, 1): Empty (\"0\")  \n- (2, 3): Wall (\"1\")  \n- (3, 2): Wall (\"1\")  \n- (3, 3): Empty (\"0\")  \n\nThus, the cat can move to (1, 3), (2, 1), or (3, 3).  \n\n### Key Threat Analysis:\nThe cat aims to reach any boundary exit (\"E\"). The most immediate threats are the shortest paths to exits:  \n1. **Path via (2, 1)**: From (2, 1), the cat can move to (2, 0), which is an exit (\"E\") on the boundary.  \n2. **Path via (1, 3)**: From (1, 3), the cat can move to (0, 2), which is also an exit (\"E\") on the boundary.  \n3. **Path via (3, 3)**: This is a longer path but still leads to exits (e.g., (0, 5) or (2, 10)) through subsequent moves.  \n\n### Strategy:\nTo trap the cat, we must block one of the critical cells in these paths. Blocking (2, 1) directly eliminates the shortest path to (2, 0), forcing the cat to rely on longer paths that can be further blocked in subsequent turns. While (1, 3) and (3, 3) also lead to exits, (2, 1) is the most immediate and critical chokepoint.  \n\nAnswer: 2 1","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its possible paths to exits. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (1, 3) (row 1, column 3). \n\n### Cat's Adjacent Cells\nSince row 1 is odd, the cat's adjacent cells are:\n- (0, 2) and (0, 3): Both are \"E\" (exits, not empty cells, so the cat cannot move here).\n- (1, 2): \"1\" (wall, blocked).\n- (1, 4): \"0\" (empty, valid move).\n- (2, 2): \"0\" (empty, valid move).\n- (2, 3): \"1\" (wall, blocked).\n\nThus, the cat’s only immediate moves are to (1, 4) or (2, 2).\n\n### Critical Path Analysis\nThe cat’s goal is to reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary. The most immediate threat is the path through (1, 4), as it leads toward the top boundary (row 0), where exits are concentrated. Blocking (1, 4) would limit the cat’s movement to (2, 2), a path that is less urgent and easier to control in subsequent turns.\n\n### Optimal Move\nPlacing a wall at (1, 4) blocks the cat’s most direct path toward the top boundary exits, significantly reducing its escape routes.\n\nAnswer: 1 4"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The cat (\"C\") is at (5,5) in the 11×11 hexagonal grid. For a cell in an odd row (r=5 is odd), the adjacent cells are: (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5). Among these, (4,5) and (6,4) are walls (\"1\"), so the cat can only move to the empty cells (0): (4,4), (5,4), (5,6), and (6,5).\n\nNext, we analyze the cat's potential escape paths to exits (\"E\") on the boundary:\n1. **(4,4) path**: Leads to the top-left exit (e.g., (0,2)).\n2. **(5,4) path**: Leads to the left exit (e.g., (4,0)).\n3. **(5,6) path**: Leads to the top-right exit (e.g., (0,6)).\n4. **(6,5) path**: Leads to the bottom exit (e.g., (10,4)).\n\nOur goal is to block a critical cell to limit the cat's escape routes. The cell (5,6) is part of the longest escape path (6 steps to exit) and is a key node in the top-right escape route. Blocking (5,6) disrupts this path, forcing the cat to rely on shorter but still viable paths, but it is the most impactful single move given the constraints.\n\nAnswer: 5 6","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's current position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (4, 4) (row 4, column 4). For a cell in an even row (row 4 is even), the adjacent cells are: (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4), and (5, 5). Among these, (4, 3) and (4, 5) are walls (\"1\"), so the cat can only move to (3, 4), (3, 5), (5, 4), or (5, 5) (all \"0\").\n\nNext, we analyze the cat's potential escape paths from these moves to boundary exits (\"E\"). The shortest escape paths are via (3, 4) and (3, 5), as they reach row 0 (top boundary) in 4 moves. For example:\n- Path via (3, 4): (4, 4) → (3, 4) → (2, 3) → (1, 3) → (0, 2) (E).\n- Path via (3, 5): (4, 4) → (3, 5) → (2, 5) → (1, 5) → (0, 4) (E).\n\nBlocking either (3, 4) or (3, 5) disrupts the shortest escape routes.

The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (5, 5). For a cell in an odd row (r=5 is odd), the adjacent cells are:  \n- (r-1, c-1) = (4, 4)  \n- (r-1, c) = (4, 5) (wall, blocked)  \n- (r, c-1) = (5, 4)  \n- (r, c+1) = (5, 6) (wall, blocked)  \n- (r+1, c-1) = (6, 4) (wall, blocked)  \n- (r+1, c) = (6, 5)  \n\nThus, the cat can move to three empty cells: (4, 4), (5, 4), or (6, 5).  \n\n### Analysis of Critical Paths  \nThe cat aims to reach any boundary exit (\"E\"). We need to block a cell that disrupts the most critical paths to exits.  \n\n1. **Path via (4, 4)**: Leads to top exits (e.g., (0, 4)) through (3, 5) → (2, 5) → (1, 5) → (0, 4).  \n2. **Path via (5, 4)**: Leads to left exits (e.g., (4, 0)) through (5, 3) → (4, 2) → (4, 1) → (4, 0).  \n3. **Path via (6, 5)**: Leads to bottom exits (e.g., (10, 5)) through (7, 5) → (8, 5) → (9, 5) → (10, 5).  \n\n### Optimal Block  \nBlocking (5, 4) disrupts the left exit path. This cell is critical because it is the only direct route for the cat to reach the left boundary exits. By blocking (5, 4), the cat loses access to this path, reducing its escape options to (4, 4) and (6, 5), which are already more constrained by existing walls.  \n\nAnswer: 5 4","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (6, 5). For a cell in an even row (row 6 is even), the adjacent cells are: (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 6), (7, 5), and (7, 6). Among these, the empty cells (\"0\") are (5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 5), and (7, 6)—these are the cat's potential next moves.\n\n### Analysis of Cat's Escape Paths:\n1. **(5, 5)**: The cat could move upward toward row 0 (top exits) via (4, 4) → (3, 5) → (2, 5) → (1, 5) → (0, 4) (exit).\n2. **(6, 6)**: The cat could move upward toward row 0 via (5, 7) → (4, 6) → (3, 7) → (2, 6) → (1, 6) → (0, 6) (exit) or downward toward row 10 via (7, 6) → (8, 6) → (9, 6) → (10, 6) (exit).\n3. **(7, 5)**: The cat could move downward toward row 10 via (8, 5) → (9, 5) → (10, 5) (exit).\n4. **(7, 6)**: The cat could move downward toward row 10 via (8, 6) → (9, 6) → (10, 6) (exit).\n\n### Critical Cell Identification:\nThe cell (6, 6) is a critical junction. If the cat moves to (6, 6), it can access both upward and downward escape paths. Blocking (6, 6) eliminates this central junction, reducing the cat's flexibility to switch between top and bottom exits. While the cat can still attempt other paths, blocking (6, 6) significantly limits its options and forces it to rely on more linear, predictable paths that are easier to monitor in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: 6 6","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the cat's position (7,5) and its possible paths to exits. The cat can move to adjacent empty cells (\"0\"), and our goal is to block the most immediate escape routes.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat's Position and Adjacency**: The cat is at (7,5) (row 7, column 5). For odd rows (like row 7), adjacent cells are: (6,4), (6,5), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5). Among these, (6,4) is a wall (\"1\"), so the cat can move to (6,5), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), or (8,5) (all \"0\").\n\n2. **Shortest Escape Path**: The closest exits are on row 10 (all \"E\"). The shortest path from the cat to row 10 is:  \n   (7,5) → (8,5) → (9,5) → (10,5) (3 steps). This path is critical because it is the fastest route to an exit.\n\n3. **Blocking the Shortest Path**: To prevent the cat from using this shortest path, we must block a cell in the sequence. Blocking (8,5) (the first step in this path) is optimal because it directly cuts off the most immediate escape route. (8,5) is an empty cell (\"0\"), making it a valid target for placing a wall.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (8,5) blocks the shortest path to the exit, forcing the cat to take longer routes (if any), which we can address in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: 8 5","\nTo determine the optimal wall placement, we first identify the cat's position and its adjacent cells. The cat (\"C\") is at (8, 4). For even row 8, adjacent cells are (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 3), (8, 5) (wall), (9, 4), and (9, 5). The cat can move to the empty cells (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 3), (9, 4), and (9, 5).\n\nNext, we analyze the cat's potential paths to exits (\"E\"). Exits are on the boundary (row 0, row 10, column 0, column 10). The most immediate threats are the two-step paths to row 10 exits:\n- From (9, 4) (row 9, odd), neighbors (10, 3) and (10, 4) are exits.\n- From (9, 5) (row 9, odd), neighbors (10, 4) and (10, 5) are exits.\n\nBlocking either (9, 4) or (9, 5) disrupts these critical two-step paths. Since (9, 4) is directly south of the cat and part of the shortest escape route, placing a wall here prevents the cat from reaching the exit in two moves.\n\nAnswer: 9 4","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its adjacent cells. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (9, 5).

We need to block paths from the cat’s current position to all exits. \n\n1. **Path via (8, 4)**: From (8, 4), the cat can move to (7, 4), (7, 5), or (8, 3). These paths can eventually lead to exits on the left or top boundary, but they are longer and less immediate.\n2. **Path via (9, 6)**: From (9, 6), the cat can move to (8, 6), (9, 7), or (9, 5) (backtrack). The most immediate threat here is the path (9, 6) → (9, 7) → (9, 8) → (9, 9) → (10, 9) (exit), which is shorter and more direct.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nBlocking (9, 6) eliminates the most immediate escape route through the right boundary.

Among these, the empty cells (\"0\") the cat can move to are (4, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4), and (6, 5).\n\n### Analysis of Cat's Escape Paths:\n1. **(4, 4)**: Leads to a path toward exit (0, 3) via (3, 5) → (2, 4) → (1, 4).\n2. **(5, 6)**: Leads to a path toward exit (1, 10) via (5, 7) → (4, 7) → (3, 8) → (2, 9).\n3. **(6, 4)**: Leads to a path toward exit (2, 0) via (6, 3) → (5, 3) → (4, 2) → (3, 2) → (2, 1).\n4. **(6, 5)**: Leads to a path toward exit (10, 5) via (7, 6) → (8, 5) → (9, 5).\n\n### Strategy:\nThe goal is to block a critical cell that disrupts the most direct escape routes. Among the cat’s possible moves, (6, 5) is part of the shortest path to exit (10, 5) (5 steps). Blocking (6, 5) cuts off this direct route, forcing the cat to rely on longer paths, increasing the chance of trapping it in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: 6 5","\nTo determine the optimal wall placement, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at (4,4) (row 4, column 4). For a cat at an even row (row 4 is even), the adjacent cells are: (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5). Checking these cells:\n\n- (3,4): Wall (\"1\")\n- (3,5): Empty (\"0\")\n- (4,3): Empty (\"0\")\n- (4,5): Wall (\"1\")\n- (5,4): Wall (\"1\")\n- (5,5): Empty (\"0\")\n\nThus, the cat can move to three empty cells: (3,5), (4,3), and (5,5). We analyze the shortest paths from these cells to exits (\"E\"):\n\n### Path via (3,5) (shortest):\n- (3,5) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (0,5) (exit). This path reaches an exit in 4 moves (cat’s turns: (3,5) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (0,5)).\n\n### Path via (4,3):\n- (4,3) → (3,3) → (2,3) → (1,3) → (0,3) (exit). This path reaches an exit in 5 moves.\n\n### Path via (5,5):\n- (5,5) → (5,6) → (5,7) → (4,7) → (3,8) → (2,8) → (1,8) → (0,8) (exit). This path reaches an exit in 7 moves.\n\nThe shortest path is via (3,5). Blocking (3,5) prevents the cat from using this critical route to the nearest exit. \n\nAnswer: 3 5","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the cat's possible paths to exits and identify critical cells to block. The cat is at (4,4) and can initially move to three adjacent empty cells: (4,3), (4,5), and (5,5). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Path via (4,5):** The cat moving to (4,5) can quickly reach the exit (0,5) in 4 steps: (4,5) → (3,6) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (0,5). This is one of the shortest paths to an exit.\n2. **Other Paths:** The paths via (4,3) and (5,5) are longer or less direct. Blocking (4,5) eliminates the most immediate threat.\n\n### Decision:\nPlacing a wall at (4,5) prevents the cat from using this critical short path to the exit (0,5), significantly reducing its options and forcing it to rely on longer, more easily blockable paths.\n\nAnswer: 4 5","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (4, 3). For a cell in an even row (row 4 is even), the adjacent cells are: (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 3), and (5, 4). Among these, (3, 4) and (5, 4) are walls (\"1\"), so the cat can move to (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), or (5, 3) (all \"0\").\n\nNext, we analyze the escape paths from these possible moves:\n1. **(3, 3)**: Leads to (2, 3) → (1, 3) → (0, 3) (exit in row 0, column 3). This is the shortest path (4 steps).\n2. **(4, 2)**: Leads to (3, 2) → (2, 1) → (2, 0) (exit in row 2, column 0).\n3. **(4, 4)**: Leads to a longer path toward (0, 8) (exit in row 0, column 8).\n4. **(5, 3)**: Leads to (6, 3) → (7, 3) → (7, 2) → (6, 1) → (6, 0) (exit in row 6, column 0).\n\nThe most immediate threat is the shortest path through (3, 3) to (0, 3). Blocking (3, 3) directly cuts off this critical path, forcing the cat to take longer or more easily blockable routes.\n\nAnswer: 3 3","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at (4,2). For a cell in an even row (r=4 is even), adjacent cells are (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3). Among these, (3,3) and (4,1) are walls (\"1\"), so the cat can move to (3,2), (4,3), (5,2), or (5,3) (all \"0\").\n\n### Key Observations:\nThe cat aims to reach boundary exits (\"E\"). The shortest paths to exits are via (3,2) and (5,2), as these cells lead to nearby exits in 2-3 moves:\n- **(3,2)**: Leads to exits (2,0) and (3,0) via (2,1) or (3,1).\n- **(5,2)**: Leads to exits (4,0) and (6,0) via (5,1) or (6,1).\n\n### Strategy:\nBlocking a cell that cuts off the most critical escape paths is optimal. (5,2) is part of two short paths to exits (4,0 and 6,0). By blocking (5,2), the cat loses access to these two immediate escape routes, forcing it to take longer paths that can be blocked in subsequent turns.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (5,2) maximizes the number of blocked escape paths.\n\nAnswer: 5 2","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is located at coordinates (3, 2). For a cell in an odd row (row 3 is odd), the adjacent cells are: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), and (4, 2). Among these, only (2, 1), (3, 1), and (4, 2) are empty (\"0\").\n\n### Analysis of Critical Paths:\n1. **(2, 1)**: This cell is in an even row (row 2). Its adjacent cells include (2, 0), which is an exit (\"E\"). The cat can move from (2, 1) to (2, 0) in one step, escaping.\n2. **(3, 1)**: This cell is in an odd row (row 3). Its adjacent cells include (2, 0), (3, 0), and (4, 0), all of which are exits (\"E\"). The cat can move from (3, 1) to any of these exits in one step, making (3, 1) a critical chokepoint with three direct exit paths.\n3. **(4, 2)**: This cell leads to longer paths toward exits on the right boundary (column 10), but these paths are less immediate.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe most immediate threat is (3, 1), as it connects to three exits. Blocking (3, 1) removes the cat’s access to these critical exit paths, forcing the cat to rely on longer or less direct routes. While (2, 1) still provides a path to an exit, blocking (3, 1) significantly reduces the cat’s options and delays its escape.\n\nAnswer: 3 1","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is located at (2, 1). Since row 2 is even, the cat's adjacent cells are:  \n- (1, 1): \"0\" (empty)  \n- (1, 2): \"0\" (empty)  \n- (2, 0): \"E\" (exit, not empty)  \n- (2, 2): \"1\" (wall)  \n- (3, 1): \"1\" (wall)  \n- (3, 2): \"0\" (empty)  \n\nThe cat can only move to adjacent \"0\" cells, so its possible moves are (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 2). The goal is to block the cat from reaching any exit (\"E\") on the boundary.  \n\nExits (\"E\") are on the boundary, and the cat wins if it reaches an exit. The critical threat is that (1, 1) and (1, 2) are adjacent to boundary exits (e.g., (0, 0) and (0, 1) are \"E\" cells on the boundary). If the cat moves to (1, 1) or (1, 2), it can quickly reach an exit.  \n\nTo prevent this, we must block one of these critical cells. Blocking (1, 1) removes the cat's access to this immediate escape route, forcing it to consider other paths (like (1, 2) or (3, 2)), which are less immediately threatening.  \n\nAnswer: 1 1"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Critical escape paths from the cat’s position include:\n1. **Path to (10,5) (row 10, column 5)**: This is a short path (5 moves) via (6,5) → (7,5) → (8,5) → (9,5) → (10,5). (6,5) is the first step in this path.\n2. **Path to (0,5) (row 0, column 5)**: Via (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (1,6) → (0,5).\n3. **Path to (0,9) (row 0, column 9)**: Via (5,6) → (5,7) → (4,7) → (3,7) → (2,8) → (1,9) → (0,9).\n4. **Path to (0,1) (row 0, column 1)**: Via (6,4) → (5,3) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (2,2) → (1,2) → (0,1).\n\n### Optimal Wall Placement\nBlocking (6,5) directly disrupts the shortest and most critical escape path to (10,5). This cell is the first step in the cat’s movement toward the bottom boundary exit (10,5). By placing a wall at (6,5), the cat loses access to this critical path, significantly reducing its options to reach an exit quickly.\n\nAnswer: 6 5","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is located at (4, 5). Since row 4 is even, the cat's adjacent cells are (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4) (wall), (4, 6), (5, 5), and (5, 6). The cat can move to the empty cells (0) among these: (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 5), and (5, 6).\n\nNext, we analyze the shortest paths the cat could take to reach an exit (\"E\"). The most immediate threat is a path leading to the exit at (0, 5) (row 0, column 5). This path is:  \n(4, 5) → (3, 6) → (2, 6) → (1, 6) → (0, 5) (E).  \n\nThe cell (1, 6) is critical here, as it is adjacent to the exit (0, 5) and serves as a chokepoint for multiple paths. Blocking (1, 6) prevents the cat from reaching (0, 5) via this route and also disrupts other potential paths through (2, 5) → (1, 6).  \n\nSince (1, 6) is an empty cell (0) and not an exit, placing a wall here is valid and blocks the shortest escape route.\n\nAnswer: 1 6","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we analyze the cat's current position and its potential paths to exits. The cat is at (3, 6) (row 3, column 6). We first identify the cat's adjacent cells and their paths to exits.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat's Adjacent Cells**: For (3, 6) (odd row), adjacent cells are:  \n   (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6). All are empty (\"0\").  \n2. **Shortest Path to Exit**: The most immediate threat is the path toward row 0 (top exits). The shortest path identified is:  \n   (3, 6) → (2, 6) → (1, 7) → (0, 7) (exit). This path allows the cat to reach an exit in 3 moves.  \n3. **Critical Node**: The cell (2, 6) is a critical node in this shortest path. Blocking (2, 6) directly cuts off the cat’s access to this path, forcing it to take longer routes.\n\n### Analysis of Blocking (2, 6):\n- Blocking (2, 6) prevents the cat from moving into this cell, eliminating the shortest path to (1, 7) and (0, 7).  \n- Other potential paths (e.g., via (3, 7) → (2, 7) → (1, 8) → (0, 8)) are longer and less immediate, giving more time to block further moves in subsequent turns.  \n\nThus, placing a wall at (2, 6) is the optimal first move to disrupt the cat’s shortest escape route.\n\nAnswer: 2 6","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the cat's current position and its possible escape paths. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (3, 7) on an 11×11 hexagonal grid. The goal is to place a wall (\"1\") on an empty cell (\"0\") to block the cat's shortest path to any exit (\"E\").\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat's Adjacent Cells**: For a cat at (3, 7) (odd row), the adjacent cells are:\n   - (2, 6) (wall, blocked)\n   - (2, 7) (empty)\n   - (3, 6) (empty)\n   - (3, 8) (empty)\n   - (4, 6) (empty)\n   - (4, 7) (empty)\n\n2. **Critical Escape Paths**:\n   - **Path 1**: (3, 7) → (3, 8) → (3, 9) → (3, 10) (E). This path leads directly to an exit in 3 steps. (3, 10) is an exit, (3, 9) is empty, and (3, 8) is empty.\n   - **Path 2**: (3, 7) → (2, 7) → (1, 7) → (0, 7) (E).

Blocking (3, 8) prevents the cat from moving to (3, 8), thereby cutting off this direct escape route. \n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (3, 8) blocks the shortest and most direct path to the exit.\n\nAnswer: 3 8","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (2, 7). Since row 2 is even, the cat's adjacent cells are: (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 6) (wall), (2, 8), (3, 7), and (3, 8) (wall). Thus, the cat can move to (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), or (3, 7).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Immediate Threats**: The cat can reach exits (\"E\") in one or two moves from several adjacent cells:\n   - From (1, 7) (row 1, odd), the cat can move to (0, 7) (E) directly.\n   - From (1, 8) (row 1, odd), the cat can move to (0, 8) (E) directly.\n   - From (2, 8) (row 2, even), the cat can move to (1, 9) (0), which is adjacent to (0, 8) (E), (0, 9) (E), and (1, 10) (E).\n   - From (3, 7) (row 3, odd), the cat would need a longer path to reach an exit, making this a less immediate threat.\n\n2. **Critical Chokepoint**: The most urgent threats are (1, 7) and (1, 8), as they directly connect to exits in one move. Blocking either of these cells would eliminate a direct escape route. Between these, (1, 8) is more critical because it also connects to (1, 9), which leads to multiple exits. Blocking (1, 8) cuts off the cat’s ability to reach (0, 8) (E) directly and reduces access to (1, 9) (a secondary escape hub).\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (1, 8) blocks the cat’s most immediate escape path to (0, 8) (E) and limits its access to other exit routes.\n\nAnswer: 1 8","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is located at coordinates (2, 8). Since row 2 is even, the cat's adjacent cells are: (1, 8) [wall], (1, 9) [empty], (2, 7) [empty], (2, 9) [empty], (3, 8) [wall], and (3, 9) [empty]. Thus, the cat can move to (1, 9), (2, 7), (2, 9), or (3, 9).\n\nNext, we analyze these possible moves to see if they lead to exits (\"E\"):\n- **(1, 9)**: Adjacent to (0, 8) and (0, 9), both exits. The cat can escape in one move from here.\n- **(2, 7)**: Adjacent to (1, 7), which is adjacent to (0, 7) (an exit). The cat can escape in two moves from here.\n- **(2, 9)**: Adjacent to (1, 10) (an exit). The cat can escape in one move from here.\n- **(3, 9)**: Adjacent to (3, 10) (an exit). The cat can escape in one move from here.\n\nAll four moves are threatening, but the most immediate threats are (1, 9), (2, 9), and (3, 9), as they allow the cat to reach an exit in one move. To block the most critical path, we prioritize blocking (2, 9), as it directly leads to the exit at (1, 10) in one move. Placing a wall here prevents the cat from using this shortest escape route.\n\nAnswer: 2 9","\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal position to place a wall to trap the cat (\"C\") such that it can no longer reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat's Position**: The cat is located at coordinates (1, 9) on the board.\n2. **Adjacent Cells**: For a cell in an odd row (r=1), the adjacent cells are: (r-1, c-1), (r-1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1), (r+1, c-1), and (r+1, c).

If the cat reaches (2, 8), it can then potentially move to other cells leading to exits. To trap the cat, we must block this only valid move.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nBy placing a wall at (2, 8), the cat loses its only possible move.

The cat is at (5,5) on an odd row, so its adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,5). Among these, (4,4) is a wall, leaving (4,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,5) as valid moves. \n\nKey observations:\n1. **Shortest Path Threat**: The cat can reach the exit at (0,5) (row 0, column 5) in 5 steps via the path: (5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (1,6) → (0,5). This is one of the shortest paths to an exit.\n2. **Critical Chokepoint**: Blocking (4,5) disrupts this critical path. (4,5) is the first step in the shortest path to (0,5) and is part of multiple escape routes. By placing a wall here, we eliminate the cat's ability to use this immediate route, forcing it to take longer paths that are easier to block in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: 4 5","\nTo determine the optimal wall placement, we first identify the cat's position at (5, 4) (row 5, column 4). The cat can move to adjacent empty cells (0s) based on hexagonal grid adjacency rules. For row 5 (odd), the adjacent cells are: (4, 3), (5, 5), (6, 3), and (6, 4). These are the cat’s immediate possible moves.\n\n### Analysis of Escape Paths:\n1. **(4, 3)**: Leads upward toward exits on row 0 (e.g., (0, 4)).\n2. **(5, 5)**: Leads upward toward exits on row 0 (e.g., (0, 5)).\n3. **(6, 3)**: Leads left toward exits on the boundary (e.g., (4, 0)).\n4. **(6, 4)**: Leads downward toward exits on row 10 (e.g., (10, 5)).\n\n### Key Insight:\nBlocking a critical cell in one of these paths can limit the cat’s options. The cell (5, 5) is a central node in the upward escape path toward (0, 5). By placing a wall here, we eliminate this specific escape route, reducing the cat’s viable paths to three instead of four. While other paths remain, (5, 5) is a high-priority target to slow the cat’s progress toward the nearest exits.\n\nAnswer: 5 5","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the cat's current position and possible paths to exits. The cat is at (4,3) (row 4, column 3). For a cat at (r, c) in an even row (r=4 is even), adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,3), (5,4). Among these, (3,3), (3,4), and (5,4) are empty (\"0\"), so these are the cat's immediate possible moves.\n\n### Key Path Analysis:\nThe cat aims to reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary. The shortest path from the cat to an exit is identified via BFS:\n- **Shortest Path**: (4,3) → (3,3) → (2,3) → (1,4) → (0,3) (exit). This path takes 4 moves, making (3,3) a critical first step.\n\n### Blocking Strategy:\nTo trap the cat, we must block its most immediate escape routes. The shortest path relies on the cat moving to (3,3) first. By placing a wall at (3,3), we eliminate this critical first step, forcing the cat to take longer, less direct paths (if any).\n\n### Verification:\n- Blocking (3,3) prevents the cat from using the shortest path to (0,3).\n- The remaining possible moves for the cat (3,4 and 5,4) lead to longer paths, giving more opportunities to block further moves in subsequent turns.\n\nAnswer: 3 3","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we analyze the cat's current position and its potential paths to exits. The cat is at (3,4) on an 11×11 hexagonal grid. The cat’s goal is to reach any boundary exit (\"E\"), and our task is to block its paths by placing a wall (\"1\") on an empty cell (\"0\").\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat’s Adjacent Cells**: The cat (at (3,4), an odd row) has four possible moves to adjacent empty cells: (2,3), (2,4), (3,5), and (4,3).\n2. **Critical Paths to Exits**: The most immediate threats are paths leading to top boundary exits (row 0). For example:\n   - Path 1: (3,4) → (2,3) → (1,4) → (0,3) (exit).\n   - Path 2: (3,4) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (1,6) → (0,6) (exit).\n   - Path 3: (3,4) → (3,5) → (3,6) → (2,6) → (1,6) → (0,6) (exit).\n\n### Analysis of Critical Cells:\n- **(3,5)**: This cell is a central hub in multiple exit paths. If the cat moves to (3,5), it can proceed to (2,5), (3,6), or (2,6), all of which lead to top exits. Blocking (3,5) cuts off these critical paths.\n- Other cells like (1,4) or (2,4) are part of shorter paths but do not block as many routes as (3,5). Blocking (3,5) directly prevents the cat from accessing a major junction that connects to multiple exit paths.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (3,5) blocks the cat’s access to a key junction, significantly reducing its ability to reach exits.\n\nAnswer: 3 5","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (2, 4) (row 2, column 4). \n\n### Cat's Adjacent Cells\nFor a cell at (r, c) where r is even (r=2), the adjacent cells are:\n- (r-1, c) = (1, 4)\n- (r-1, c+1) = (1, 5)\n- (r, c-1) = (2, 3)\n- (r, c+1) = (2, 5)\n- (r+1, c) = (3, 4)\n- (r+1, c+1) = (3, 5)\n\nChecking these cells, the empty cells (\"0\") are (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5), and (3, 4). These are the cat's possible first moves.\n\n### Critical Path Analysis\nThe cat aims to reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary. The most immediate threat is the path through (1, 4):\n- From (1, 4) (row 1, column 4), the adjacent cells (for odd r=1) include (0, 3), which is an exit (\"E\"). This creates a 2-step path: (2, 4) → (1, 4) → (0, 3) (exit). Blocking (1, 4) cuts this critical path.\n\n### Other Paths\nOther potential paths (e.g., through (2, 5) or (3, 4)) are longer or less immediate. For example, (2, 5) leads to (1, 6), which connects to exits, but this is a 3-step path. Blocking (1, 4) prioritizes neutralizing the shortest and most immediate escape route.\n\n### Conclusion\nPlacing a wall at (1, 4) blocks the cat's shortest path to an exit, significantly reducing its escape options.\n\nAnswer: 1 4","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (2, 5). Since row 2 is even, the cat's adjacent cells are (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 5), and (3, 6). Among these, (1, 5) and (3, 5) are walls (\"1\"), so the cat can move to (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), or (3, 6) (all \"0\").\n\nNext, we analyze the most immediate threats to the cat reaching an exit (\"E\"). Exits on the boundary (e.g., row 0) are critical. For the cat to reach an exit quickly, the shortest paths involve moving upward toward row 0. \n\n- **Path 1**: (2, 5) → (1, 6) → (0, 5) (exit). Here, (1, 6) is adjacent to the cat and one move away from exit (0, 5). If the cat reaches (1, 6), it can move to (0, 5) (exit) on its next turn.  \n- **Path 2**: (2, 5) → (2, 6) → (1, 7) → (0, 6) (exit). This path is longer (two moves to reach a row 1 cell), making (1, 6) the more urgent threat.  \n\nBlocking (1, 6) prevents the cat from using the shortest path to an exit. This cell is empty (\"0\") and can be walled (\"1\") to eliminate the immediate threat. \n\nAnswer: 1 6","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is located at (2, 6) (row 2, column 6). For a cell in an even row (row 2 is even), the adjacent cells are: (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 6), and (3, 7). \n\n### Step 1: Analyze the cat's possible moves\n- (1, 6): Wall (\"1\"), blocked.\n- (1, 7): Empty (\"0\"), possible move.\n- (2, 5): Empty (\"0\"), possible move.\n- (2, 7): Empty (\"0\"), possible move.\n- (3, 6): Empty (\"0\"), possible move.\n- (3, 7): Empty (\"0\"), possible move.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate escape paths\nThe cat aims to reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary. Key observations:\n- **(1, 7)**: Adjacent to (0, 6), which is an exit (\"E\"). If the cat moves to (1, 7), it can immediately escape to (0, 6) on its next turn. This is the most immediate threat.\n- **(2, 7)**: Adjacent to (1, 8), which is empty. From (1, 8), the cat can move to (0, 7), another exit. However, this path requires two steps (cat → (2,7) → (1,8) → (0,7)), making it less urgent than (1, 7).\n- Other moves (e.g., (2, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)) lead to longer paths without immediate access to exits.\n\n### Step 3: Block the most critical path\nTo prevent the cat from escaping, we must block the most immediate threat. Placing a wall at (1, 7) eliminates the cat’s ability to reach (0, 6) in one move, neutralizing the primary escape route.\n\nAnswer: 1 7","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we analyze the cat's current position and its possible paths to exits. The cat is at (2,7) on an even row, so its adjacent cells are (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,7), and (3,8). Among these, (1,7) is a wall, so the cat can move to (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,7), or (3,8).\n\n### Key Threat Analysis:\nThe most critical threat is the cell (1,8). For a cell in an odd row (row 1 is odd), the adjacent cells of (1,8) include (0,7), which is an exit (\"E\"). If the cat moves to (1,8), it can then move directly to (0,7) (an exit) on its next turn, resulting in an immediate loss. \n\n### Blocking the Immediate Threat:\nTo prevent this, placing a wall at (1,8) blocks the cat’s access to this critical cell. This eliminates the shortest path the cat could take to reach an exit in two moves. \n\nAnswer: 1 8","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (2, 8). For a cell in an even row (r=2 is even), the adjacent cells are: (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 8), (3, 9). \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Adjacent Cells Analysis**: \n  - (1, 8) is a wall (\"1\"), so the cat cannot move there.\n  - (1, 9), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 8), and (3, 9) are empty (\"0\"), so they are valid moves for the cat.\n\n- **Escape Paths**: The cat aims to reach boundary exits (\"E\"). Critical escape paths from the cat's adjacent cells are:\n  - (1, 9) → (0, 8) (exit in row 0).\n  - (2, 9) → (2, 10) (exit in column 10).\n  - (3, 9) → (3, 10) (exit in column 10).\n  - (3, 8) leads to a longer path down to row 10, but this is a slower escape route.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe most immediate threats are (1, 9), (2, 9), and (3, 9), as they allow the cat to reach an exit in one additional move. Blocking any of these cells would eliminate a critical escape path. Among these, (2, 9) is particularly urgent because it directly adjacent to the exit (2, 10) in the same row, making it the most immediate escape route.\n\n### Move:\nPlacing a wall at (2, 9) blocks the cat's direct path to the exit (2, 10), reducing its immediate escape options.\n\nAnswer: 2 9","\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal move to place a wall such that the cat (C) is trapped and cannot reach any exit (E) on the boundary. \n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Cat's Position**: The cat is located at coordinates (1, 9) in the given 11×11 hexagonal grid.\n2. **Adjacent Cells**: For a cell in an odd row (r=1 is odd), the adjacent cells are: (r-1, c-1), (r-1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1), (r+1, c-1), and (r+1, c). Checking these for the cat's position (1, 9):\n   - (0, 8) and (0, 9) are exits (E), but the cat cannot move into exits directly (as per rules, the cat moves to adjacent empty cells \"0\").\n   - (1, 8) and (1, 10) are walls (1).\n   - (2, 9) is a wall (1).\n   - The only adjacent empty cell (0) is (2, 8).\n\n3. **Critical Move**: The cat’s only possible move to an empty cell is (2, 8). If we block this cell with a wall, the cat will have no valid moves left. Since the cat is not on an exit, it will be trapped, and we win.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (2, 8) blocks the cat’s only escape route to an empty cell, ensuring the cat cannot move and is not on an exit.\n\nAnswer: 2 8"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Blocking (4,1) disrupts both of these shorter paths, forcing the cat to take longer routes (e.g., (4,2) → (5,2) → (6,1) → (6,0), 4 steps) or rely on the longer Path 3.\n\n### Decision:\nBlocking (4,1) maximizes the disruption of the shortest escape paths, significantly reducing the cat's ability to reach an exit quickly.\n\nAnswer: 4 1","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the cat's current position and its potential paths to exits. The cat is at (4, 2) (row 4, column 2). We first identify the cat's adjacent cells (since row 4 is even, adjacent cells are (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3)). Among these, (3,2), (3,3), (5,2), and (5,3) are empty (\"0\"), so the cat can move to these cells.\n\n### Key Path Analysis:\n- **Path 1: (4,2) → (3,2) → (2,1) → (2,0) (E)**  \n  (3,2) is an adjacent empty cell. From (3,2) (row 3, odd), the cat can move to (2,1) (row 2, column 1, \"0\"). From (2,1) (row 2, even), the cat can directly reach (2,0) (row 2, column 0), which is an exit (\"E\"). This path is 3 steps.  \n- **Path 2: (4,2) → (5,2) → (6,1) → (6,0) (E)**  \n  (5,2) is another adjacent empty cell. From (5,2) (row 5, odd), the cat can move to (6,1) (row 6, column 1, \"0\"). From (6,1) (row 6, even), the cat can directly reach (6,0) (row 6, column 0), which is an exit (\"E\"). This path is also 3 steps.  \n\n### Critical Blocking Points:\nBoth paths are short and immediate threats. To trap the cat, we must block one of these critical paths. The most effective strategy is to block a cell in the shortest path. Blocking (2,1) (row 2, column 1) disrupts Path 1, as (2,1) is the intermediate cell between (3,2) and the exit (2,0). This prevents the cat from reaching the exit via this route.\n\nAnswer: 2 1","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the cat's current position and its possible paths to exits. The cat is at (5, 2) (row 5, column 2). For a cat in an odd row (row 5), its adjacent cells are: (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 1), and (6, 2). Among these, (4, 1) and (5, 1) are walls, so the cat can move to (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 1), or (6, 2).\n\n### Critical Path Analysis:\n- **(6, 1) Threat**: The cell (6, 1) is adjacent to (6, 0), which is an exit (\"E\"). If the cat moves to (6, 1), it can reach (6, 0) (an exit) on its next turn, causing an immediate loss. This is the most urgent threat.\n- Other paths (e.g., (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 2)) are less critical in the short term, as they do not directly connect to an exit in one move.\n\n### Decision:\nTo block the immediate threat, we must place a wall on (6, 1), preventing the cat from moving there and reaching the exit.\n\nAnswer: 6 1","\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position at (5, 3) (row 5, column 3). The cat can move to adjacent empty cells (\"0\") based on hexagonal grid adjacency rules. For an odd row (r=5), the adjacent cells are: (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 2), and (6, 3). Among these, (4, 3) is a wall (\"1\"), so the cat’s valid moves are (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 2), and (6, 3).\n\n### Key Observations:\nThe cat aims to reach any exit (\"E\") on the boundary. The most direct escape routes for the cat are:\n1. **Path 1**: (5, 3) → (6, 3) → (7, 3) → (8, 3) → (9, 3) → (10, 3) (exit).\n2. **Path 2**: (5, 3) → (5, 4) → (6, 4) → (7, 4) → (8, 4) → (9, 4) → (10, 4) (exit).\n\n### Critical Cell Analysis:\nBlocking (5, 4) disrupts the second escape route. If (5, 4) is blocked, the cat’s access to the rightward path (toward higher columns) is cut off. This forces the cat to rely on the first path (via (6, 3)), but even if the cat takes that path, subsequent walls can be placed to block further progress. However, blocking (5, 4) immediately reduces the cat’s options and limits its ability to reach exits through the rightward route, which is a critical chokepoint.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (5, 4) is the optimal move to restrict the cat’s escape paths.\n\nAnswer: 5 4","\nTo determine the optimal wall placement, we analyze the cat's possible paths to exits and identify critical nodes that block the shortest routes. The cat is at (6,3) and aims to reach boundary exits (\"E\"). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Cat's Adjacent Moves**: From (6,3) (even row), the cat can move to (5,3), (6,2), (6,4), (7,3), or (7,4) (all \"0\").\n2. **Shortest Paths to Exits**: The most immediate exits are in row 10 (e.g., (10,3), (10,4)). The shortest paths to these exits follow:\n   - (6,3) → (7,3) → (8,3) → (9,3) → (10,3)\n   - (6,3) → (7,4) → (8,4) → (9,4) → (10,4)\n3. **Critical Node**: (8,3) is a key node in the shortest path to (10,3). Blocking (8,3) disrupts this path, forcing the cat to take longer, less direct routes.\n\n### Decision:\nPlacing a wall at (8,3) blocks the primary path to the exit (10,3), significantly reducing the cat's ability to reach an exit quickly.\n\nAnswer: 8 3","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move to trap the cat, we first identify the cat's position and its possible moves. The cat (\"C\") is located at (7, 3) (row 7, column 3). For a cell in an odd row (row 7 is odd), the adjacent cells are: (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 2), (7, 4), (8, 2), and (8, 3). Among these, the valid empty cells (\"0\") the cat can move to are (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 4), and (8, 2) (since (7, 2) and (8, 3) are walls).\n\nNext, we analyze the escape paths from these possible moves. The most immediate threat is the path through (8, 2). From (8, 2), the cat can move to (9, 2) or (9, 3) in its next turn, both of which lead directly to exits (\"E\") in row 10 (e.g., (9, 2) → (10, 1) and (9, 3) → (10, 2)). Blocking (8, 2) prevents the cat from accessing this critical path to the exits.\n\nOther potential paths (e.g., through (6, 2), (6, 3), or (7, 4)) are longer and less immediate, giving more time to block subsequent moves in future turns. However, the shortest and most dangerous path is through (8, 2), making it the priority to block.\n\nAnswer: 8 2","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position and its adjacent cells. The cat (\"C\") is located at (6, 3) in the 11×11 grid. For a cell in an even row (row 6 is even), the adjacent cells are: (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 2), (6, 4), (7, 3), and (7, 4). \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Adjacent Cells Check**: Among these, (5, 4) is a wall (\"1\"), so the cat’s possible moves are to (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 4), (7, 3), and (7, 4) (all \"0\").\n- **Escape Paths**: The cat’s primary goal is to reach an exit (\"E\") on the boundary. The most immediate exits are on the bottom boundary (row 10). The shortest paths for the cat to reach row 10 involve moving downward through (7, 3) or (7, 4):\n  - **Path via (7, 3)**: (6, 3) → (7, 3) → (8, 3) → (9, 3) → (10, 2) (exit).\n  - **Path via (7, 4)**: (6, 3) → (7, 4) → (8, 4) → (9, 4) → (10, 3) (exit).\n\n### Strategy:\nBlocking the earliest critical cell in the most immediate escape path is key. The cell (7, 3) is a critical node in the shortest path to the bottom exit (row 10). By placing a wall here, we disrupt the cat’s ability to use this direct downward path, forcing it to take longer, more vulnerable routes.\n\nAnswer: 7 3","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the cat's current position and possible escape paths. The cat (\"C\") is at coordinates (6,4). For a cell at (r, c) where r is even (6 is even), adjacent cells are (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,4), (7,5). Checking these:\n\n- (5,4): Wall (\"1\") → blocked.\n- (5,5): Empty (\"0\") → possible move.\n- (6,3): Empty (\"0\") → possible move.\n- (6,5): Wall (\"1\") → blocked.\n- (7,4): Empty (\"0\") → possible move.\n- (7,5): Wall (\"1\") → blocked.\n\nThe cat can move to (5,5), (6,3), or (7,4). We focus on the most immediate escape path. \n\n### Key Path Analysis:\nThe cat moving to (7,4) (row 7, column 4) has a direct path to an exit on the boundary (row 10). From (7,4):\n- Next move: (8,4) (row 8, column 4) → empty.\n- From (8,4): (9,4) (row 9, column 4) → empty.\n- From (9,4): (10,4) (row 10, column 4) → exit (\"E\").\n\nThis 3-step path (7,4) → (8,4) → (9,4) → (10,4) is the most critical escape route. Blocking (8,4) (row 8, column 4) cuts this path, preventing the cat from reaching the exit via row 10.\n\n### Verification:\n- (8,4) is currently empty (\"0\"), so placing a wall here is valid.\n- Blocking (8,4) eliminates the cat’s ability to progress toward row 10, forcing it into slower or blocked paths.\n\nAnswer: 8 4","\nTo determine the optimal move, we first identify the cat's position at (5,5). The cat can move to adjacent empty cells (\"0\") based on hexagonal grid adjacency rules. For an odd row (r=5), the adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), and (6,5). Among these, (4,5), (5,4), and (6,5) are walls (\"1\"), leaving (4,4), (5,6), and (6,4) as valid moves.\n\n### Analysis of Critical Paths:\n1. **Path via (5,6):**  \n   The cell (5,6) is an empty cell (\"0\") and is critical because it leads to two direct exit paths:  \n   - **Rightward Exit (Row 5, Column 10):** (5,6) → (5,7) → (5,8) → (5,9) → (5,10) (exit \"E\").  \n   - **Upward Exit (Row 0, Column 5):** (5,6) → (4,6) → (3,6) → (2,6) → (1,6) → (0,5) (exit \"E\").  \n\n   Blocking (5,6) cuts both paths, preventing the cat from reaching these exits.  \n\n2. **Other Paths:**  \n   - (4,4) and (6,4) lead to less direct or blocked paths, making them less urgent compared to (5,6).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (5,6) blocks the most critical paths the cat would use to reach exits. \n\nAnswer: 5 6","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the cat's possible paths to exits and identify critical chokepoints. The cat is at (4,4) and can move to adjacent empty cells (0). Key observations:\n\n### Cat's Immediate Moves:\nThe cat’s adjacent empty cells are (3,4), (3,5), and (5,5). We focus on paths from these cells to exits (\"E\").\n\n### Threat Analysis:\n1. **Path via (3,5)**:  \n   From (3,5), the cat can move to (3,6) → (2,6) → (1,6) → (0,5) (E) or (2,7) → (1,7) → (0,7) (E). These paths lead to exits in row 0, which are the shortest and most immediate threats.  \n   - (3,6) is a critical chokepoint in both paths. Blocking (3,6) cuts off access to (2,6) and (2,7), halting progress toward row 0 exits.\n\n2. **Other Paths**:  \n   The cat’s move to (5,5) leads to longer paths toward row 10 exits, but these are less immediate and can be addressed in subsequent turns if needed. Blocking (3,6) prioritizes neutralizing the most urgent threat.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing a wall at (3,6) blocks the cat’s shortest paths to row 0 exits, significantly reducing its ability to reach an exit.\n\nAnswer: 3 6"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
