If the cat moves to (5,6) for example, then the cat has a clear route to an exit. Thus, to slow it down, it would be best to block (5,6). Place a wall at (4,6).

Let's examine cells the cat could get to within a few moves.\n\nI think a good move is to block (3, 2).

The goal is to trap the cat by placing walls such that it cannot reach any of the exits 'E'. I need to analyze the cat's possible moves and strategically place a wall to block its path.\n\nCurrently, the cat is at (1, 2). Its possible moves are to (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2).\n- (0, 2) is an exit, so I must block this.\n- (0, 3) is an exit, so I must block this.\n- (1, 1) is a wall, so it cannot move here.\n- (1, 3) is an empty cell.\n- (2, 1) is a wall, so it cannot move here.\n- (2, 2) is an empty cell.\n\nThe most immediate threat is the exit at (0,2) and (0, 3). But I can't block exits.\nNext, I need to consider the exits further away from the cat.\n\nLet's analyze the optimal move to block the cat. The cat can move to (1,3) or (2,2). If it moves to (1,3) I would want to try to block (0,3). If it moves to (2,2) then I'd want to block (3,2) or (3,3).\n\nLet's consider blocking the path at (1,3). If I were to place a wall at (0,3), it won't work since exits cannot be blocked.\n\nI should block (1,3). The cat would then be at (1,3). It could then go to (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3). I would still lose since it could go to (0,3).\n\nLet's try blocking (2,2). If the cat goes to (2,2), it can go to (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2).

This blocks the cat's move to the right and downward.\n\nI think blocking (2,3) is more strategic in the long run because it is more central, so let's place a wall at (2,3).\n\n```\nAnswer: 2 3\n```"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The cat will try to move to an adjacent '0' cell to reach an exit. I need to analyze the board and block the cat's possible paths.\n\nThe cat is currently at (4, 4).

I need to block these moves or their subsequent paths to the exits.\n\nLet's consider placing a wall at (3, 5). Now the cat can only move to (5, 4) or (5, 5). If I place a wall at (5,5), the cat can only move to (5,4).\nIf I place a wall at (5,4), now the cat can only move to (5,5).\n\nPlacing a wall at (3,5) and (5,5) seems like a good start.

Let's analyze the possible moves for the cat and try to cut off its escape routes.\n\nThe cat at (5, 4) has the following neighbors:\n(4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 3), (6, 4)\nThese locations on the board are:\n(4, 4) = 0\n(4, 5) = 1\n(5, 3) = 0\n(5, 5) = 0\n(6, 3) = 0\n(6, 4) = 0\nThe cat can move to (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 3), and (6, 4).\n\nLooking at these options, placing a wall at (4, 4) seems beneficial since it blocks a path towards the top exits. Let's evaluate further. After I play at (4,4), the next possible locations of the Cat are:\n(5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4). I want to block these as efficiently as possible. Let's see the shortest path to exit from those locations.\n(5,3) can easily move to (4,3) and then reach exit in a few steps.\n(5,5) can move to (4,5) but it is already blocked by 1.\n(6,3) can easily move to (7,3) and then reach exit in a few steps.\n(6,4) can easily move to (7,4) and then reach exit in a few steps.\n\nPlacing at (6,3) is also a very tempting move. It stops the cat if it moves down from (5,4) towards (6,3). But let's go back to (4,4). If the cat moves to (5,3), I want to block it. Let's try to prevent it going to (5,3) at all.
