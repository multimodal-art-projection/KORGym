This suggests a potential error in the provided row sums or the image itself.\n\n**2. Assumption for Finding a Solution:**\n\n*   Since the task requires calculating column sums, we must assume an intended solution exists, possibly with a slight error in the problem statement.\n*   The equation 7B = 559 was derived, which is close to 7B = 560 (B=80). Let's assume B=80 was intended.\n*   If B=80, using derived equations leads to P=47.\n*   Different equations yield conflicting values for LG (-67, -413, -414). We choose LG=-67 as it satisfies the integer range [-100, 100].\n*   Based on these:\n    *   P = 47\n    *   B = 80\n    *   LG = -67\n    *   T = -26\n    *   Y = B + 28 = 108 (Violates range)\n    *   M = LG + 266 = 199 (Violates range)\n    *   R = 26 - 2B - 2LG = 0\n*   This set of values satisfies most row equations (R1, R3, R5, R6, R7, R8) but fails for R2 and R4, and violates the range constraint for Y and M. This is the closest approximation found due to the inconsistency.\n\n**3.

Analysis of Color Blocks and Grid**\n\n*   There are 6 distinct colors: Yellow (Y), Cyan (C), Green (G), Blue (B), Red (R), Magenta (M).\n*   The grid can be interpreted as 7 rows and 6 columns based on the smallest block unit.\n*   Each cell in the 7x6 grid is assigned a value based on its color.\n*   The numbers on the right are the sums for each row.\n\n**2. Formulating Equations**\n\nBased on the 7x6 grid interpretation, the row sums give the following equations:\n*   Row 1: Y + C + G + C + Y + R = 2Y + 2C + G + R = -211\n*   Row 2: Y + B + B + C + Y + R = 2Y + 2B + C + R = -414\n*   Row 3: R + Y + Y + G + G + G = 2Y + 3G + R = -165\n*   Row 4: Y + B + M + M + Y + M = 2Y + B + 3M = -58\n*   Row 5: Y + C + G + R + C + Y = 2Y + 2C + G + R = -91\n*   Row 6: Y + G + G + R + B + B = Y + 2G + 2B + R = -91\n*   Row 7: R + B + M + G + R + G = B + M + 2G + 2R = 247\n\n**3. Identifying Contradiction**\n\nThere is a contradiction between the equation for Row 1 and Row 5. Both rows have the same composition of colors (2 Yellow, 2 Cyan, 1 Green, 1 Red), meaning their sum expression is identical: 2Y + 2C + G + R. However, the provided sums are different (-211 for Row 1 and -91 for Row 5). This mathematical impossibility indicates a flaw in the puzzle's provided data (either the image or the row sums).\n\n**4. Attempting to Resolve**\n\nAssuming either Row 1's sum or Row 5's sum is a typo does not lead to a valid solution. Solving the system of equations (even with one of the contradictory equations removed) results in non-integer values for the colors (e.g., C + M = 586\/3 or C + M = 916\/3 depending on the assumption). This violates Rule 3, which states all values must be integers. Furthermore, some derived values fall outside the -100 to 100 range.\n\n**5. Calculating Column Sums**\n\nThe column sums are expressed as:\n*   C1 = 5Y + 2R\n*   C2 = Y + 2C + 3B + G\n*   C3 = Y + B + 3G + 2M\n*   C4 = 2C + 2G + 2R + M\n*   C5 = 3Y + C + B + G + R\n*   C6 = Y + B + 2G + 2R + M\n\nSince no valid integer solution exists for Y, C, G, B, R, M due to the contradictions and resulting non-integer\/out-of-range values, it is impossible to calculate the numerical column sums based on the provided information and rules.\n\nAnswer: [Calculation impossible due to inconsistent data]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board which is a picture and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, analyze the color blocks and calculate column sums.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Let's choose an even value for `lg`, for example, `lg = -10`.\n*   If `lg = -10`:\n    *   `r = -10 + 13 = 3`\n    *   `g = -10 + 50 = 40`\n    *   `b = -10 - 17 = -27`\n    *   `3(-10) + 2p = -176` => `-30 + 2p = -176` => `2p = -146` => `p = -73`\n*   All values {lg:-10, r:3, p:-73, b:-27, g:40} are integers within the range [-100, 100].\n\n**4. Calculate Column Sums:**\nUsing these values:\n*   **Col 1:** lg + r + b + p + g + lg + p = -10 + 3 + (-27) + (-73) + 40 + (-10) + (-73) = -150\n*   **Col 2:** p + lg + p + r + p + b + b = -73 + (-10) + (-73) + 3 + (-73) + (-27) + (-27) = -280\n*   **Col 3:** b + r + r + p + r + g + p = -27 + 3 + 3 + (-73) + 3 + 40 + (-73) = -124\n*   **Col 4:** p + lg + p + r + p + b + g = -73 + (-10) + (-73) + 3 + (-73) + (-27) + 40 = -213\n*   **Col 5:** b + g + g + lg + r + g + lg = -27 + 40 + 40 + (-10) + 3 + 40 + (-10) = 76\n\nThe column sums are [-150, -280, -124, -213, 76].\n\nAnswer: [-150, -280, -124, -213, 76]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board which is a picture and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, analyze the color blocks and calculate column sums.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Identify the unique colors and assign variables:\n    - Red (R), Blue (B), Gold (G), Magenta (M), Green (Gr), Teal (T), Purple (P), Lime Green (L). There are 8 distinct colors.\n2.

Analyze Equation R1 (4R + 2G = 319):\n    - The left side (4R + 2G = 2*(2R + G)) must be an even number if R and G are integers.\n    - The right side (319) is an odd number.\n    - This equation has no integer solution for R and G, contradicting Rule 3 (\"All values are integers\").\n4.  Assumption due to inconsistency:\n    - The most likely issue is a typo in the sum for Row 1. Common puzzles of this type have integer solutions. Let's assume the sum for Row 1 should be 318 instead of 319, as 318 is even. The equation becomes 4R + 2G = 318, or 2R + G = 159.\n5.  Solve the system with the assumption R1 = 318:\n    - From derivations in thought, assuming R1=318 and R3, R7, R8 are correct led to the consistent equation 2R + 3T = 258. This implies T must be even for R to be an integer.\n    - Further derivations assuming R2, R4, R5, R6 are also correct led to the equation 3R + 2T = 260 (based on R5 check).\n    - Solving the system:\n        - 2R + 3T = 258\n        - 3R + 2T = 260\n    - Multiply first by 3, second by 2:\n        - 6R + 9T = 774\n        - 6R + 4T = 520\n    - Subtracting the second from the first: 5T = 254.\n    - T = 254 \/ 5 = 50.8. This is not an integer.\n6.  Conclusion on solvability:\n    - The system of equations derived from the provided image and row sums is inconsistent and does not yield integer solutions, even when assuming the most likely typo (R1 sum = 318). There might be multiple errors in the row sums or the puzzle structure is flawed.\n7.  Proceeding to find *an* answer despite issues:\n    - Since a definitive integer solution cannot be found satisfying all conditions, I will use the values derived from assuming R1=318 and satisfying the relation 2R+3T=258, which seemed robust.

Formulate Equations from Row Sums:**\nBased on the grid and the row sums provided on the right:\nRow 1: Y + 2R + N + M = -317\nRow 2: Y + R + C + 2B = -116\nRow 3: Y + 3C + M = -109\nRow 4: Y + 2R + B + N = -279\nRow 5: Y + R + 2C + B = -163\nRow 6: N + 2C + 2B = -268\nRow 7: Y + R + N + 2M = -296\nRow 8: R + C + 3N = -349\n\n**3. Solve the System of Equations:**\nWe can find relationships between variables by subtracting equations:\n- (Eq 1) - (Eq 4): M - B = -38  => M = B - 38\n- (Eq 2) - (Eq 5): (C + 2B) - (2C + B) = -116 - (-163) => -C + B = 47 => B = C + 47\n- (Eq 1) - (Eq 7): (2R + M) - (R + 2M) = -317 - (-296) => R - M = -21 => R = M - 21\n\nNow, express B, M, R in terms of C:\n- B = C + 47\n- M = B - 38 = (C + 47) - 38 = C + 9\n- R = M - 21 = (C + 9) - 21 = C - 12\n\nSubstitute B into Eq 6 to find N in terms of C:\n- N + 2C + 2B = -268 => N + 2C + 2(C + 47) = -268 => N + 4C + 94 = -268 => N = -362 - 4C\n\nSubstitute R and N into Eq 8:\n- R + C + 3N = -349 => (C - 12) + C + 3(-362 - 4C) = -349\n- 2C - 12 - 1086 - 12C = -349\n- -10C - 1098 = -349\n- -10C = 749\n- C = -74.9\n\nThis result (C = -74.9) indicates an inconsistency in the provided row sums, as the rules state all values must be integers. If we assume a slight typo in the sums and round C to the nearest integer, C = -75.\n\nLet's calculate the values based on C = -75:\n- C (Cyan) = -75\n- B (Blue) = C + 47 = -75 + 47 = -28\n- M (Magenta) = C + 9 = -75 + 9 = -66\n- R (Red) = C - 12 = -75 - 12 = -87\n- N (Green) = -362 - 4C = -362 - 4(-75) = -362 + 300 = -62\n\nNow find Y (Gold) using an equation, for example Eq 3:\n- Y + 3C + M = -109 => Y + 3(-75) + (-66) = -109 => Y - 225 - 66 = -109 => Y - 291 = -109 => Y = 182\n\nNote: The value Y=182 violates the rule that values must be between -100 and 100.

For example, deriving relationships between G and B using different subsets of equations yields inconsistent results:\n    *   One derivation path leads to 8G + 3B = -127.\n    *   Another derivation path leads to 6G + 5B = 104.\n    Solving these two equations gives B = 797\/11 and G = -947\/22, which are not integers.\n    *   A third derivation path leads to B = G - 66. Substituting G=71\/11 gives B=-655\/11. These values are inconsistent with the previous result.\n    This shows that the system of equations derived from rows 2-8 is inherently inconsistent.\n\n5.  Conclusion:\n    The provided puzzle image and rules lead to a system of linear equations that has no integer solution. The row sums are inconsistent with the rules, particularly the requirement for integer values. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the unique integer values for the colors and calculate the column sums.\n\n6.  Calculate Column Sums (Theoretical):\n    Since the values cannot be determined due to inconsistencies, the column sums cannot be calculated.\n    *   C1: Y + G + G + Y + G + B + Y + G = 3Y + 4G + B\n    *   C2: Y + C + R + C + R + C + B + Y = 2Y + B + 2R + 3C\n    *   C3: M + R + B + M + C + Y + G + M = Y + G + B + R + 3M + C\n    *   C4: B + M + C + G + G + R + G + B = 2B + R + M + C + 3G\n    *   C5: M + R + M + G + G + C + R + B = B + 2R + 2M + C + 2G\n    *   C6: R + B + B + C + B + B = R + 4B + C\n\nGiven the impossibility of finding a solution, I cannot provide numerical column sums.\n\nAnswer: N\/A"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board which is a picture and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, analyze the color blocks and calculate column sums.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The closest even integer that might be intended, perhaps as an average or correction, is -58 (or potentially -60, -62, -64).

This indicates an inconsistency in the provided row sums.\n*   Further analysis assuming subsets of equations are correct consistently leads to contradictions or violations of the rule that values must be integers between -100 and 100 (e.g., deriving P = Y - 376 if Eq 1 and Eq 4 are assumed correct).\n\n**4. Find a Potential Solution Ignoring Constraints:**\n\nSince a valid solution satisfying all rules and sums seems impossible due to the contradictions, let's find a solution that satisfies the maximum number of consistent equations, ignoring the [-100, 100] constraint for now. Assume Row 2 and Row 3 sums are incorrect, and Rows 1, 4, 5, 6 are correct.\nThis leads to the unique integer solution (as derived in thought process):\n*   Y = 0\n*   G = -38\n*   R = -43 (since R = G - 5)\n*   P = -376 (since P = Y - 376)\n*   B = 236 (since B = 160 - 2Y - 2G)\n\nLet's verify these values with the assumed correct rows:\n*   R1: 0 + 2(-43) + (-376) + 236 = -86 - 376 + 236 = -226 (Correct)\n*   R4: 2(0) + 2(-43) + 236 = 0 - 86 + 236 = 150 (Correct)\n*   R5: -38 + 2(-376) + 2(236) = -38 - 752 + 472 = -318 (Correct)\n*   R6: 0 + 2(-38) + (-376) + 236 = -76 - 376 + 236 = -216 (Correct)\n(Note: These values violate the -100 to 100 rule).\n\n**5. Calculate Column Sums:**\n\nUsing these values (Y=0, R=-43, P=-376, B=236, G=-38), calculate the sum for each column:\n*   **Column 1:** Y + G + R + Y + P + G = 0 + (-38) + (-43) + 0 + (-376) + (-38) = **-495**\n*   **Column 2:** R + P + Y + R + G + Y = (-43) + (-376) + 0 + (-43) + (-38) + 0 = **-500**\n*   **Column 3:** R + B + P + B + B + P = (-43) + 236 + (-376) + 236 + 236 + (-376) = -43 + 3(236) + 2(-376) = -43 + 708 - 752 = **-87**\n*   **Column 4:** P + G + G + R + P + G = (-376) + (-38) + (-38) + (-43) + (-376) + (-38) = 2(-376) + 3(-38) + (-43) = -752 - 114 - 43 = **-909**\n*   **Column 5:** B + Y + B + Y + B + B = 236 + 0 + 236 + 0 + 236 + 236 = 4(236) + 2(0) = 944 + 0 = **944**\n\nThe column sums are [-495, -500, -87, -909, 944].\n\nAnswer: [-495, -500, -87, -909, 944]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board which is a picture and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, analyze the color blocks and calculate column sums.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

However, Row 1 gives R+LB+G = 160, while Row 7 gives R+LB+G = 50.\n*   Further analysis reveals other inconsistencies. For example, subtracting Row 5 from Row 3 gives P - G = 178. Substituting this into Row 2 gives 3G + LB + Y + B = -101. However, Row 8 states 3G + Y + LB + B = -42. These contradictions mean the puzzle as presented (with the given row sums) does not have a solution that satisfies all conditions simultaneously according to the rules (especially Rule 1: Same color represents same value, and Rule 3: All values are integers).\n\n**3.

This indicates an inconsistency in the problem statement. The puzzle cannot be solved exactly as given while satisfying all rules (especially the integer value rule).\n\nHowever, we must attempt to find the most plausible solution. Let's explore the differences between rows, which often reveal relationships:\n(1) - (2): (2P + 2C + G) - (2P + C + 2G) = -377 - (-345) => C - G = -32\n(3) - (2): (2P + 2C + G) - (2P + C + 2G) = -381 - (-345) => C - G = -36\nThis confirms the inconsistency (C - G cannot be both -32 and -36).\n\n(5) - (1): (3P + C + G) - (2P + 2C + G) = -413 - (-377) => P - C = -36\n(5) - (3): (3P + C + G) - (2P + 2C + G) = -413 - (-381) => P - C = -32\nThis also confirms the inconsistency (P - C cannot be both -36 and -32).\n\nSince we have conflicting information, let's try an approach that averages the inconsistencies, assuming they resulted from small errors.\nAverage (C - G) = (-32 + -36) \/ 2 = -34\nAverage (P - C) = (-36 + -32) \/ 2 = -34\nSo, let's assume:\nC - G = -34 => G = C + 34\nP - C = -34 => P = C - 34\n\nNow substitute these into one of the original equations. Let's use Equation 2 (which was involved in deriving both inconsistent pairs):\n2P + C + 2G = -345\n2(C - 34) + C + 2(C + 34) = -345\n2C - 68 + C + 2C + 68 = -345\n5C = -345\nC = -69\n\nNow find P and G:\nP = C - 34 = -69 - 34 = -103\nG = C + 34 = -69 + 34 = -35\n\nLet's check these values against the other equations:\nEq 1: 2(-103) + 2(-69) + (-35) = -206 - 138 - 35 = -379 (Close to -377)\nEq 3: 2(-103) + 2(-69) + (-35) = -206 - 138 - 35 = -379 (Close to -381)\nEq 5: 3(-103) + (-69) + (-35) = -309 - 69 - 35 = -413 (Matches exactly)\n\nThis set of values (P=-103, C=-69, G=-35) provides a consistent result for Eq 2 and Eq 5, and is off by only 2 for Eq 1 and Eq 3.

Analyze Color Blocks and Equations**\n\nLet the values of the colors be:\n- Cyan = C\n- Red = R\n- Light Green = G\n- Purple = P\n\nFrom the image, we can set up equations based on the row sums:\n1.

Solve the System of Equations:**\n\nSubtracting (2) from (1): (R + 2G + 2P) - (R + G + P + 2C) = -109 - (-175) => G + P - 2C = 66 (6)\nSubtracting (3) from (2): (R + G + P + 2C) - (R + 2G + 2C) = -175 - (-249) => -G + P = 74 => P = G + 74 (7)\nSubstitute (7) into (6): G + (G + 74) - 2C = 66 => 2G - 2C = -8 => G - C = -4 => G = C - 4 (8)\nSubstitute (8) into (7): P = (C - 4) + 74 => P = C + 70 (9)\nSubstitute (8) into (3): R + 2(C - 4) + 2C = -249 => R + 2C - 8 + 2C = -249 => R + 4C = -241 => R = -241 - 4C (10)\nSubstitute (9) and (10) into (5): 2(-241 - 4C) + 2(C + 70) + C = -137 => -482 - 8C + 2C + 140 + C = -137 => -342 - 5C = -137 => -5C = 205 => C = -41\n\nNow find the other values:\nG = C - 4 = -41 - 4 = -45\nP = C + 70 = -41 + 70 = 29\nR = -241 - 4C = -241 - 4(-41) = -241 + 164 = -77\n\nSo the values are:\nRed (R) = -77\nGreen (G) = -45\nPurple (P) = 29\nCyan (C) = -41\n\n**3. Calculate Column Sums:**\n\nColumn 1: R + C + C + R + C = -77 + (-41) + (-41) + (-77) + (-41) = -277\nColumn 2: G + R + G + P + R = -45 + (-77) + (-45) + 29 + (-77) = -215\nColumn 3: G + G + G + R + P = -45 + (-45) + (-45) + (-77) + 29 = -183\nColumn 4: P + P + C + C + P = 29 + 29 + (-41) + (-41) + 29 = 5\nColumn 5: P + C + R + C + R = 29 + (-41) + (-77) + (-41) + (-77) = -207\n\nThe calculated column sums are [-277, -215, -183, 5, -207].\n\nAnswer: [-277, -215, -183, 5, -207]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board which is a picture and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, analyze the color blocks and calculate column sums.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

There is no solution (integer or otherwise) that satisfies all five equations simultaneously.\n\nSince the problem asks for column sums, we must assume there's a typo in the provided row sums and find the most plausible solution that fits the rules (integer values between -100 and 100, different values for different colors).\n\nThe contradiction arises directly from equations 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let's assume one of them is incorrect. The contradiction P-C=116 and C-P=10 seems the most direct issue. If we assume C-P=10 (derived from R1, R2) is correct, then P-C=116 (derived from R3, R4) must be wrong. This suggests either R3=193 or R4=77 is incorrect.\n\nLet's assume R4=77 is the incorrect sum and try to solve the system using R1, R2, R3, R5:\n(1) 2P + 2G + R = 254\n(2) P + 2G + R + C = 264\n(3) P + G + 3R = 193\n(5) P + G + R + 2C = 212\n\nFrom (1) and (2), we still get C = P + 10.\nSubstitute C = P + 10 into (5):\nP + G + R + 2(P + 10) = 212\nP + G + R + 2P + 20 = 212\n3P + G + R = 192  (Equation 5')\n\nNow we have a system of 3 equations with 3 variables P, G, R:\n(1) 2P + 2G + R = 254\n(3) P + G + 3R = 193\n(5') 3P + G + R = 192\n\nFrom (5'), R = 192 - 3P - G.\nSubstitute R into (1): 2P + 2G + (192 - 3P - G) = 254 => -P + G = 62 => G = P + 62.\nSubstitute R into (3): P + G + 3(192 - 3P - G) = 193 => P + G + 576 - 9P - 3G = 193 => -8P - 2G = -383 => 8P + 2G = 383.\nSubstitute G = P + 62 into 8P + 2G = 383:\n8P + 2(P + 62) = 383\n10P + 124 = 383\n10P = 259\nP = 25.9\n\nThis gives non-integer values, which violates Rule 3. As shown in the thought block, trying to remove other equations also leads to non-integer solutions or contradictions.\n\nGiven the inconsistency and the requirement for an integer solution, the most reasonable approach is to find an integer solution that closely matches the majority of the equations, assuming one or more row sums are typos. The non-integer solution derived from assuming R4 is incorrect was P=25.9, G=87.9, R=26.4, C=35.9. Rounding these values might violate the rule that different colors have different values (P and R would both round to 26). Let's try rounding and adjusting slightly to maintain distinct integer values:\nP = 26\nG = 88\nR = 27 (+0.6 from 26.4)\nC = 36 (+0.1 from 35.9)\nThese values are distinct integers between -100 and 100.\n\nLet's calculate the row sums with these values:\nR1: 2(26) + 2(88) + 27 = 52 + 176 + 27 = 255 (vs 254)\nR2: 26 + 2(88) + 27 + 36 = 26 + 176 + 27 + 36 = 265 (vs 264)\nR3: 26 + 88 + 3(27) = 26 + 88 + 81 = 195 (vs 193)\nR4: 88 + 36 + 3(27) = 88 + 36 + 81 = 205 (vs 77)\nR5: 26 + 88 + 27 + 2(36) = 26 + 88 + 27 + 72 = 213 (vs 212)\nThe errors are small for rows 1, 2, 3, 5, supporting the hypothesis that row 4's sum (77) was likely incorrect.\n\nNow, calculate the column sums using P=26, G=88, R=27, C=36.\nColumn 1: P + G + P + G + P = 3P + 2G = 3(26) + 2(88) = 78 + 176 = 254\nColumn 2: G + R + R + C + C = G + 2R + 2C = 88 + 2(27) + 2(36) = 88 + 54 + 72 = 214\nColumn 3: G + P + R + R + C = P + G + 2R + C = 26 + 88 + 2(27) + 36 = 26 + 88 + 54 + 36 = 204\nColumn 4: R + G + G + R + G = 3G + 2R = 3(88) + 2(27) = 264 + 54 = 318\nColumn 5: P + C + R + R + R = P + C + 3R = 26 + 36 + 3(27) = 26 + 36 + 81 = 143\n\nThe column sums are [254, 214, 204, 318, 143].\n\nAnswer: [254, 214, 204, 318, 143]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board which is a picture and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, analyze the color blocks and calculate column sums.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

However, the sums given are different (328 vs 200).

The maximum possible difference between two values B and G is |B - G| ≤ |B| + |G| ≤ 100 + 100 = 200.

Solve using Eq 1, 2, 4, 5.\n    *   P + T = 129 (from Eq 2) => T = 129 - P\n    *   LG + R = 27 (from Eq 5) => R = 27 - LG\n    *   LG + 2T + P = -46 (derived from Eq 1 and R=27-LG)\n    *   LG + T + 4P = 189 (Eq 4)\n    *   Substitute T=129-P into LG+2T+P=-46: LG + 2(129-P) + P = -46 => LG + 258 - 2P + P = -46 => LG - P = -304 (Eq F)\n    *   Substitute T=129-P into LG+T+4P=189: LG + (129-P) + 4P = 189 => LG + 129 + 3P = 189 => LG + 3P = 60 (Eq G)\n    *   Solve Eq F and G:\n        *   Subtract F from G: (LG + 3P) - (LG - P) = 60 - (-304) => 4P = 364 => P = 91.\n        *   Substitute P=91 into Eq G: LG + 3(91) = 60 => LG + 273 = 60 => LG = -213.\n    *   Find T and R:\n        *   T = 129 - P = 129 - 91 = 38.\n        *   R = 27 - LG = 27 - (-213) = 240.\n*   We found integer values: LG=-213, T=38, P=91, R=240.\n*   Check against Rule 3 (value range -100 to 100): LG and R are outside this range.\n*   Check against the assumed incorrect Eq 3: 2LG + 3T + R = 2(-213) + 3(38) + 240 = -426 + 114 + 240 = -72. The given sum is 157.\n*   Despite the inconsistencies (likely error in Row 3 sum and violation of value range), this is the only integer solution derived from a consistent subset of 4 equations. We proceed using these values: P=91, T=38, LG=-213, R=240.\n\n**3.
